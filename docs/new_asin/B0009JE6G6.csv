2294942,5,B0009JE6G6,"This was an EXCELLENT and well written show.  The cast was excellent, but Clancy Brown and Rebecca Gayheart were outstanding.  At the time, this show was in the top three to include Star Trek TNG (synd.), and Space Above and Beyond (fox).  NBC pulled the plug entirely too soon.",1121385600,6,278,4.63265306122449
2294943,3,B0009JE6G6,"Earth 2 was a short lived prime time sci-fi series that offered an interesting premise, but was far from original in it's delivery.  Nearly 200 years into the future, Earth has come to the point where it can no longer support life, with remaining humans seeking refuge on orbiting space stations.  Living in sterile environments has led to the birth of a new and deadly virus, which Devon (Debrah Farentino) believes can be cured and mankind saved if our race once again lives in a natural environment.  A planet light years away, which seems very similar to the Earth of old, is the destination of Devon, her infected child, and a crew of families, to which they travel.  The ship however, is sabotaged, and a crash landing ensues, leaving a handful of survivors.  Among them are Devon, the ship's engineer (Clancy Brown), and the pilot (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), most of which do solid work throughout the series.  Of course there are some alien beings to be found, and all doesn't go as well as one would hope for the survivors, but there is something that is oddly likeable about Earth 2.  It never reaches for the originality and witiness of past sci-fi classics like Farscape or even Joss Whedon's short lived Firefly, but then again, it was never given the chance to come into it's own.  Dedicated fans of the short lived series will doubt want to snatch this DVD set up, but for the rest who missed out on Earth 2 and are more suited to Farscape and Firefly, this is better left on the shelf.",1120867200,10,1496,4.5767790262172285
2294944,4,B0009JE6G6,"Admittedly this is no Firefly, a stellar standout show but Earth 2 was interesting and had potential.

2294945,5,B0009JE6G6,I can't believe this show did not last longer than what it did.  I never missed an eposide.  My future studies teacher in school would even tape it occasionally and we would watch it in class. This show is a must see anyone would enjoy it even if they are not a sci-fi fan. I have pre-ordered it and can't wait to get it.,1117756800,10,321,4.0
2294946,5,B0009JE6G6,"Michael Duggan, Carol Flint, Mark Levin and Billy Ray created an interesting concept for a new sci-fi TV program.  Airing in the fall of 1994, their show was entitled ""Earth 2"" and was set 200 years in the future.  ""Earth 2"" painted a very dark future for mankind in which the Earth is no longer capable of supporting terrestrial life.  Consequently, the surviving members of the human race have been living in orbiting space stations; but living in the sterile environments has created a sickness called the Syndrome.  A wealthy woman named Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino) is convinced that the key to mankind's survival, including her Syndrome-infected son Ulysses 'Uly' Adair (Joey Zimmerman), is to once again live in a natural environment.  Gathering 250 other Syndrome-infected families, she pursues the establishment of a colony on a planet named G889 orbiting a star 22 light-years away; but the current government has other plans for planet G889. Undeterred, Devon, her son and some of the other 250 families embark on a ship named ""Eden Advance"" for G889 to establish a community in advance of the main colonization; but the ship has been sabotaged.  The ship arrives at G889, but the ship soon explodes.  Stranded on G889, the ship's survivors attempt to settle and begin new lives on G889.  The survivors include Devon, Uly, engineer John Danziger (Clancy Brown), his daughter True (J. Madison Wright), pilot Alonzo Solace (Antonio Sabato Jr.), Dr. Julia Heller (Jessica Steen), Earth-government representative Morgan Martin (John Gegenhuber), his wife Bess (Rebecca Gayheart) and Uly's cyborg teacher Yale (Sullivan Walker).

Unfortunately, lower than expected ratings for the series caused its cancellation after its first season; so only a total of 22 episodes were ever produced. These episodes include the following:

1. ""First Contact (1)"".  The embarkation to G889, destruction of the ship and survivors reaching the planet's surface.  G889 is inhabited by subterranean natives called Terrians.

2. ""First Contact (2)"".  Uly is abducted by Terrians, but he is returned after they heal him from they Syndrome.

3. ""The Man Who Fell to Earth (Two)"". An astronaut who had previously crash-landed on G889, Gaal (Tim Curry), kills the commander (Richard Bradford).  Solace has Terrian dreams.

4. ""Life Lessons"". Gaal tries to disrupt the survivors' encampment.

5. ""Promises, Promises"".  Gaal abducts several Terrians; but the colonists free them. Gaal disappears underground and is never seen again.

6. ""A Memory Play"".  The colonists discover a third escape pod with people infected by a woman that had been implanted by the government to sabotage the ship.  Grendler saliva is the cure.

7. ""Water"". Devon & Dazinger search for water.

8. ""The Church of Morgan"". Morgan & Bess argue while Dr. Heller contemplates removing Uly's pineal gland; but Uly is becoming an evolutionary link with the Terrians.

9. ""The Enemy Within"". Dr. Heller injects some of Uly's DNA into herself, she goes nuts and is abandoned.

10. ""Redemption"". Dr. Heller rejoins the colonists thanks to Solace.

11. ""Moon Cross"". A woman, Mary (Kelli Williams), is found living among the Terrians, who want Uly to be their link with colonists.

12. ""Better Living Through Morganite (1)"". As Yale regains his memory, Morgan finds glowing rocks.

13. ""Better Living Through Morganite (2)"".  Mary saves Yale from Terrian punishment after he's been captured (along with Morgan and Bess) and finds out he's not a criminal.

14. ""Grendlers in the Myst"". The colonists believe they have located a killer, but he's only the son of the real killer that's now only a hologram.

15. ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told"". Danzinger comes across a colony of reformed criminals

16. ""Brave New Pacifica"". Two scavenging Grendlers come across a box containing human blood.

17. ""After the Thaw"". Dazinger is possessed by a an evil Terrian's spirit.

18. ""The Boy Who Would be Terrian King"". A future version of Uly travels back in time to have Devon hide some his blood.

19. ""Survival of the Fittest"".  Several colonists start to act strange after consuming a Grendler when they are stranded.

20. ""All About Eve"".  Dying from a mysterious disease, the colonists find a crashed ship from 100 years ago whose computer may explain the cure.

21. ""Natural Born Grendlers"". Solace gets depressed about being marooned while Devon & Bess trade for supplies with a friendly Grendler.

22. ""Flower Child"".  Dazinger & Bess have strange symptoms after being sprayed with a native plant's pollen.

Overall, I rate ""Earth 2-The Complete Series"" with 5 out of 5 stars. It's a shame that this show was not given sufficient opportunity to continue past its first and only season.",1116288000,341,4737,5.137254901960785
2294947,5,B0009JE6G6,"Long-awaited by fans to come to home video, Earth 2 chronicles the first months of survival for a small party of human colonizers stranded on what seems to be an ideal terraform world.  Emerging from a mildly dystopian, bureaucratic, and ecologically disastrous future in which much of humanity has moved onto space stations, this planet - G889, or ""Earth 2"" - is a veritable Shangri-La.  Sabotaged by a manipulative orbiting government, however, the crew is faced with a paranoid landscape in which they cannot trust each other at first, or the initial appearance of G889. Some of these colonists intended to make landfall on the planet, others didn't, and none of them anticipated the trials they would face from the planet, from each other, and from a distant but subtly menacing Earth.  They must form a cooperative band to not only survive, but acclimate to this strange planet while trekking to the site of their planned advance colony before a large colony ship arrives.

After a decade in which the only available copies of these 21 episodes were those recorded from the original (and occasional syndication) broadcasts, and after recent petitioning by a dedicated core of fans, Earth 2 finally comes to DVD.  Though not inherently creative (many of the show's aliens, incidents and general plot themes could be found throughout science fiction literature and films), Earth 2 did weave together disparate fiction conventions in unique and often charming ways to produce a literal wagon train in the stars.  Underlying themes of environmentalism, indigenous rights, female empowerment, and repentance, though, added a substance to what might have otherwise been a bland, repetitive imitation of other science fiction.  Although occasionally hokey and even melodramatic (i.e., time-lapse cloud footage and poor music video-quality ""dreamscape"" scenes do degrade the show at times), this short-run series remained entertaining, consistent, and resonant to real-world issues; it continues to be on the eve of its return to television via this 3-disc DVD set.  The set is likely scant on extra features, as the series was filmed before making-of specials for television shows had become the ubiquitous smorgasbord DVD consumers have come to expect on current series' releases.  However, the episodes alone are worth the purchase.

Fans of more recent television series, such as ""Firefly"" (though Earth 2 admittedly lacks the verbal wit and relative sophistication of Joss Wedon's sci-fi series), may enjoy giving these discs a spin.  Readers of Niven's ""Ringworld"" series or Robinson's ""Mars"" series may also be interested in giving Earth 2 a try.",1114992000,152,2650,5.285714285714286

I definitely file this under brilliant but canceled.

My complaint is that even though I bought new discs, a few of them are scratched.

2295030,3,B0009JE6G6,"To paraphrase Shakespeare: The fault lies not in the stars, but with the writers.
It pains me to say that about ""Earth 2"" because I love the concept and I thought the actors did a very nice job of bringing the scripts they were given to life. The scripts, however, were not as wonderful as the idea behind this show that could well have been favorably compared to such groundbreaking science fiction programs as ""Star Trek"" and ""The Twilight Zone.""
The show's only season orbits the idea that a small group of people, who have spent their lives on space stations because Earth is all but uninhabitable, have gone in search of a new world on which to settle. There is a good reason for their decision to leave all that they know behind in search of a new planet to populate: A disease that is the direct result of living on the stations is killing their children.
So far, so good.
The problem is that the writers tried to stuff too many goodies into their scripts. There are aliens - okay, that's to be expected since the planet is very much like Earth and, as a result, could be expected to support life. There are also, however, other humans on the planet. Turns out Earth 2 has been used as a secret penal colony by the people who run the space stations. Some of these humans are downright bad people; others are perhaps not, although they have their own agendas. Then there are secret station operatives who plan to colonize the planet, subjugating the native population in the process. And then... well, my point is simply that the writers tried to do too much in too short a period of time. The result: What could have been a cleanly written narrative is, well, not. Instead, it bogs down because there are too many story lines.
Despite that, Debrah Farentino, Clancy Brown and the rest of the cast did an admirable job portraying members of the advance party for the first group of settlers. The cinematography was well done and the directors kept the pace of the show moving crisply even though several of the storylines were so overloaded that it must have been difficult to do that. The special effects were, for the time period, exceptionally well done.
Not the classic that it could have been, I give it 3.5 stars and recommend it to sci-fi fans who will find it interesting - as I did - if not wonderful.",1454630400,9,2316,4.503562945368171

2295053,1,B0009JE6G6,"Just a fair warning for folks thinking of buying Earth 2. This review isn't about the show (which I like), it's about the poor quality of the dvds.

I purchased this a few years ago and recently pulled it out to watch again. The Earth 2 discs are double sided, and when I went to play them this time I found that at least one episode skipped on every single disc (both sides). I took a close look at these discs, and every disc looks like it has spots and pitting all over the discs. I store all of my dvds in cd wallets and have done so for over ten years, and I have never had any problems with any dvds deteriorating. These dvds have only been handled a few times over the years and the rest of the time they have been in the Case Logic wallet. There are NO scratches or fingerprints on any discs. Oddly enough, it was the middle episode on both sides that skipped on all of the discs.

Every other dvd in that wallet is fine, including the 3rd season of Sliders - ALSO double-sided discs, and also rarely played. Several of the dvds in the same wallet are older than Earth 2 and those are all fine - including the dvds that haven't been played in years. I can't imagine it's the plastic of the cd wallet reacting with the discs because the pitting is on BOTH sides, AND no other double-sided disc in any of the 20+ wallets I use has this damage. I know that dvds have a shelf life and won't last forever, but I do my best to store them properly. If ANY of my other double-sided discs were breaking down like these, then I'd suspect the cd wallet as the problem - but they are all fine. Believe me, I immediately checked! I can only conclude that for some reason these discs just aren't as high quality as other dvds.

It's a shame because I really like this show. I'm also frustrated and upset because I don't know how to fix the pitting problem OR prevent further degradation of the discs. Looks like I'm going to be spending some quality time with google.

If you like the show then you pretty much have to put up with shoddy discs if you want to own the show. Just be aware that they aren't going to last as long as they should, and that you're shelling out good money for a cheap product. You're also going to have to find another way to store them other than the box they come in. The box is the old-style box where the discs are ""stacked"" on top of each other - complete stupidity for double-sided discs. Add to that, these discs are so cheaply made that they would be wrecked in no time just from taking them out of the case.

i absolutely loved this series and wish it had not been canceled at the end of the first season. It's another example of intelligent science fiction being canceled because networks want way more audience numbers than it could possibly ever generate. Television is a fantastic medium largely wasted on lowest common denominator content.

Television has gone down hill a great amount over the last decade, so we have to mine the past for shows we might have missed while shown on television. Including good ones that were canceled because people didn't ""get"" them. For me, that's how i saw Earth 2: way after it had been on and canceled. DVD and streaming video has been wonderful for catching missed programs and favorites no longer broadcast on the generally abysmal television network ecosystem. If you are unsure about buying Earth 2, check it out on Netflix (it has been there, but no promises that it's still available for streaming).

The end of Earth 2 is a bit cliff-hanger-ish, but not so bad as to make you feel like you'll be wondering forever as to the resolution of that cliff-hanger. You can assume that the person in crisis would have been okay later, and that the real loss in cancelation is in not knowing where the whole expedition itself, and the politics/sociology/environmental issues would have ended up. Still, worth a watch, and has been worth living in my DVD collection.

The performances were great (though Tim Curry wasn't a high point for me), and the direction was excellent. Some really beautiful ideas and visuals are present in this series. Remember this is not a NEW program. This was on television when computer special effects were still quite expensive and primitive. They did well in Earth 2 with all practical effects, models, and one or two shots of CGI in the premiere. This series is much more focused on location filming (gorgeous), story-telling, ""what-if"" concepts, and actor performances than on special effects and action. The ideas and concepts were interesting. The stories and characters were emotionally involving and generally smart. Some particularly excellent performances here, too, from a few scifi favorites (Clancy Brown is great in everything, and Earth 2 had my favorite Jessica Steen performance/character ever).

i find myself wondering if audiences simply believe zombies are more realistic than aliens and interstellar space flight... Why does The Walking Dead catch people so strongly? Is it the risk formula? Is it the violence? It's a great series, and an example of television being done well, but i can't help lament that people swarm all over that show while shows like Firefly and Earth 2 got killed in under one year. Maybe both would have done better with shorter seasons and more cliffhangers...

Anyway, comparisons aside, if you can deal with science fiction, this is a lovely and thoughtful series. If you are concerned about environmental issues, and are embarrassed at how your ancestors swept aside the land's natives, then this series is right up your alley.

If you liked Outcasts, you will probably like Earth 2. If you haven't seen Outcasts, and you DO like Earth 2, then i highly recommend seeing Outcasts, too.",1418774400,6,3457,4.9809358752166375

2295066,5,B0009JE6G6,"I loved this series as a kid! The show ended too soon, and on a cliffhanger no less. But it's still worth watching as a good scifi show from the Star Trek: TNG days. There were some incredibly beautiful and compelling moments in Earth 2, and themes ranged from parental sacrifice to government control to interspecies friendship to fights over new resources and oppression of indigenous species and so on. Bonus: the show was filmed in gorgeous northern New Mexico and they made good use of the light and landscapes. I loved the way the colonists quickly learned how reliant they were on the planet, and how their relationship and understanding of the Terrians (the primary alien species on G889) evolved. Nostalgia brought me to this page and I laughed when I saw the actors being given top billing: Rebecca Gayheart and Antonio Sabato Jr. The negative side to this series was the occasionally cheesy acting and the occasional silly side story. Bess (Gayheart's character) and Alonzo (Sabato's) were more often than not involved in some of the unfortunately cheesy acting moments. Debrah Farentino, Jessica Steen, and Clancy Brown on the other hand were just excellent excellent in their roles. As a young girl I thought Devon Adair and Julia Heller were great role models, and I thought John Danziger played the role of loving father/technical wizard and curmudgeon who challenged Devon brilliantly. These actors, the Terrians, some storylines and the gorgeous scenery carried a lot of the show and made me deeply sad they did not continue it. I've always wondered why the show didn't get picked back up or adapted, as the idea of how to colonize other worlds is a perennial favorite scifi theme.  I wish Farentino had been picked to play Janeway on Star Trek Voyager - she was (is) a believable leader and really wonderful actor. Alas.

Screened again out of nostalgia. In the stark light of 2013, certain actors and their performances held up well; others not so much. Ditto the story arcs which ran the gamut from pretty darn good to routine rubber stamp.

A dying Earth is seeding its first exo-terrestrial colonies. The five most compatible planets are being tested to see which one will become our new home. One particular blue globe, G-889, twenty-two light years away is considered the prime candidate. And under the guise of helping the ""Syndrome Children"", desperately ill young ones suffering having lived their entire lives aboard sterile space stations, a group of pioneers has been chosen to resettle there.

Unknown to them, a shadowy geopolitical cabal known as The Council, wants more than just a fresh chance to restart humanity. They've known that leaving our doomed home was the only real option for a very long time. For more than two generations they've planned, plotted and manipulated their way to controlling whichever system is chosen. But G-889 is much more than just Earth-like. Its native inhabitants are mystically and biologically bonded to the planet itself. Interestingly, The Council already knows this. Has known about it for years. And they're holding back that secret knowledge because it will likely kill most of the first generation pioneers. Unless they, the people of Eden Project, do something unexpected to prevent it.

Some Of The Good:

- The plot line which had Dr. Julia Heller's clandestine communications with The Council. Probably the one arc that felt most real and delivered the best drama. Jessica Steen played the part with absolute perfection as one of the survivors and a simultaneous mole. It's a theme that would be later replicated by several more successful programs like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>'. If the writers had incorporated more of this type of hidden agenda threads and less on the somewhat sketchy supernatural aspects, perhaps we'd be referring to this program as ""That great scifi classic"", instead of a barely remembered blip on the television landscape.

- Thought the comedic psuedo-fellatio scene in ""Water"" was hilarious! Right up there with 'Airplane' and the AutoPilot emergency inflation system. :-D  Glad they tried to incorporate this kind of humor. Sex has always been a part of classic scifi. It's a damn shame that so many modern productions seem to bow down to the gods of political correctness by substituting graphic violence for something that is fun, funny, enjoyable, and in the right context - beautiful. Shameful that PC is slowly eroding the very soul that makes good scifi such a wonderful place to explore - turning it banal and trite. Sad.

- ""Survival Of The Fittest"" was probably the strongest drama the show presented in its single season. A riff on Kurosawa's eternal 'Rashomon', as four survivors recount their struggle without water, food or hope. Their desperate actions are slowly revealed as they face the crimes of unlawful intrusion, manslaughter and infanticide. A superior episode with outstanding performances.

Some Of The Not So Good:

- Pretty much anything involving the star of the program, Devon Adair, played to annoying perfection by Debrah Farentino. Her interpretation of the character could sometimes be infuriating; a grating mix of arrogant patronizer and ever-fearful mom. Like many helicopter parents - wearing blinders to the exclusion of the welfare of others. Made even more aggravating since it was her responsibility to care for and lead the survivors.

Could the show creators have found a different, better, actress for the role? I think so.

Overall, 'Earth 2' was a very decent series with some very real potential. The last couple of episodes really seemed to gel, indicating that the producers and writers might've finally discovered the right formula, the right balance. But it came too late. The audience capture was long gone when it came time for renewal.

It's really unfortunate that we'll never know how things might've turned out.

Another argument for the Amazon half-star. I'm caught between a high three and a low four.

Call it a high three.

Show Note:

- As I mentioned, the use of a mole posing as one of the survivors would be used to much greater effect and to much greater success in a series like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>"". Which is ironic because one of the frequent guest stars which fueled the mole/conspiracy themes was Terry O'Quinn - who discovered this stranded survivor formula mixed with mystic elements could indeed be extremely successful.

- In 1994, when this show was produced, there was no proof exoplanets existed. Science had debated it for centuries and it seemed like we'd never know the answer, at least not in our lifetimes. But ten years later, that theory was confirmed; ending and upending all debate. We had incontrovertible proof that such planets existed. And it took another half decade to discover ""Earth-like"" planets in what is now known as the Goldilocks Zone. Freakishly, one series of planets in the Scorpius System - Planet Gliese 667Cc specifically - is just about 22 light years away and sits dead center in the habitable zone. Now, of course it's several times bigger than our terra firma, but I find it an amazing coincidence that 'Earth 2' envisioned such a planet with such uncanny prescience.

Personal Note:

- Was terribly saddened to learn that young J. Madison Wright, who portrayed True Danzinger, passed away at such a young age. God bless you Madison. And bless co-star Clancy Brown who helped her family pay for the expensive medical treatment that allowed her a few more years with us.",1384646400,7,5878,5.259615384615385

2295099,4,B0009JE6G6,"I discovered this show fairly recently and enjoyed it very much,
  despite its flaws. My understanding is that while on the air in
  1994-1995, the show began losing viewers,despite its strong start.
  My own take is that far too often, the writers stuffed alot of
  elements into an episode that were too vaguely explored,
  defied credibility (e. g., the spider-driven space-time continuum),
  or were just head-scratchers (for example, the mother hologram).
  I appreciate that some of these stratagems led to interesting
  plot revelations (the mother hologram episode exposed the story
  about Danziger's wife), or allowed the action to take place
  somewhere other than winter camp (like the nice waterfront
  setting enabled by the spider tunnel). Nevertheless,
  the best episodes were ones with a single or
  small number of very well-defined conflicts, narratives that
  progressed fairly linearly and clearly.  Examples are
  many episodes from the first half of the series: First
  Contact 1 & 2, Memory Play, the Julia story arc episodes,
  and from the later episodes, Survival of the
  Fittest. Sadly, these tightly structured, well-told stories faded
  from the second half of the season, and many episodes were overstuffed
  with metaphysical elements that didn't work all that well (Grendlers
  in the Myst), or were not made clear enough (All About Eve). Other
  episodes were just cheesy and imitative, like the Greatest Love
  Story (underground medieval setting, black magic -c'mon!). Wasn't there
  a better way to foreshadow Danziger's feelings for Devon? Perhaps
  anticipating renewal of the series, the producers deliberately
  left some of the episodes vague in the hopes of developing
  characters (e. g., Mary) or situations (""This planet will reject you"")
  in the next season.",1366934400,,1808,5.370909090909091

2295101,5,B0009JE6G6,"For some reason, ""Earth 2"" recently emerged in my mind and I had had not thought of this show for over 15 years. Such an urge/signal drove me to purchase this series, which is consisted of only 22 episodes (with additions of two episodes from other shows, including ""Sliders""). I surely remembered this series as a teenager and recall how excited I was to have seen it but I did not know that it only lasted for a year. Thinking back on it, I found what was appealing to me about this show was an idea of ""starting over"" on a new planet and discarding ""old habits"" that one was used to on the futuristic stations. The ""Earth"" that they knew before arriving was in such a bad, deteriorating state (i.e., acid rains).

""Earth 2"" is about the journey and settlement of a small group called the Eden Project (led by Devon Adair), with a plan make a trip to an Earth-like planet called G889 with a hope to find a cure to ""the syndrome."" Adair's son, Uly, was healed by a native group called the Terrians, who have a symbiotic relationship with the planet and was able to communicate with the colonists by a way of dreaming. They also plan to create a new colony called New Pacifica before an arrival of 200+ families. However, there's an insidious governmental group whom were ever watchful and tried to control over the colonists was known as the Council, who have their own agenda for the planet. This show seemed to have a strong exploration of Gaia hypothesis.

Personally, I've enjoyed this sci-fi show, which is pretty standard of its time, and I am glad to have watched it again.

I have looked up on some of the actors, whom I am familiar with and others I have little knowledge of. It is very sad to find that J. Madison Wright (who played a little girl True Danziger) died in 2006 and Sullivan Walker (who played cyborg Yale) died in 2012 - both of heart attack.",1361145600,3,1867,4.421511627906977
2295102,2,B0009JE6G6,"Why anyone who enjoys good science fiction like Avatar, Lost, Supernatural, Fringe and so on, would see any good at all concerning Earth 2 series is way beyond me.

The idea behind the series--people missing their landing zone on a new planet by a couple thousand miles and having to hike to their intended drop zone and encountering dangers along the way--is a excellent story base in itself with tremendous potential. HOWEVER, the script, special effects (if one should even be so bold as to call them that), and the acting were all far below acceptable, and being believable was out of the question thus shattering any illusions of an otherwise good story line.

Little rubber dolls that purr like a cat and move so stilted across the screen so that one looks for the strings someone had to be manipulating like a puppet? Come on!

And ""Morgan""? Ah, yes, Morgan, the employee of the Council caught up on this journey? Whoever wrote his character profile and behavior for this series had to have been someone mentally on par with a student in the fifth or sixth grade with minimal writing experience and NO experience with adult human emotions and behavior. Morgan's behavior, or how the screenwriters had him behaving, as well as his lines was not just unbelievable, it is pathetic. I find it difficult to believe any director or producer would even allow acting like that on the set.  Morgan was  about as realistic and believable as the little purring rubber creature.

And Bess, Morgan's pretty young wife who is obviously intelligent, why on earth would she be so in love with her husband's idiotic and childish behavior with the mental stability of a 10-year old? With all the actors there is either over-acting or deadpan reactions.

The new planet they are on... G889, twenty-two light years from earth, I believe, is even more laughable! When they communicate with the space stations orbiting earth with those funky headsets, they have an instant connection and instant conversation over the distance of 22 LIGHT YEARS?  You bet! And the ""alien planet"" is very obviously southwestern Colorado or northern New Mexico, and certainly not any alien world whatsoever.

This is obviously a seriously low budget film and I am trying to finish watching the rest of this series because I abhor the thought of not finishing the thing after I spent good money on it.

2295108,3,B0009JE6G6,"The premise was excellent but the writers turned a great idea into painfully, plodding drivel. The pace was so slow it would try the patience of a saint. While I was an Executive female and thus do not have any objections to females in leadership roles; the female lead in this series was badly written & designed. She is a completely self involved, over protective mother to the point of making the viewers nauseous to watch her constant hovering over her child. This character would allow the entire group to perish in pursuit of her personal agenda as the overprotective mother from hell; bordering on Munchhausens by proxy. Rarely anyone challenges her while she decides their every move.

Who would follow someone like this? Although, she wasn't overbearing & egomaniacal like Janeway, her constant tunnel vision focus on her son & total disregard for the group's welfare in favor of her personal idiosyncracies became quite tiresome after 3 or 4 episodes. This may be fine for a PTA president or scout Troop leader but not a leadership role to colonize an alien planet. Frankly, the group should have removed her from her self-assumed leadership position on the first episode. The entire series was all about her personal needs and her forcing her decisions upon the others which usually turns out badly. Terry Quinn would have been a better choice as a group leader instead of the virtual reality villain. His talents were wasted.

Then there is the group leaders constantly patronized, frail son Uly whose every waking moment is dominated by his hovering mother. Yet he was repeatedly left unsupervised so he could fall victim to that weeks villain. Too much focus was placed on this weakly designed character. The second child is a girl who constantly causes trouble & weekly near fatalities and never learns her lesson. Yet the adults leave her to wander without supervision where she gets into unending trouble. They finally drop off her behavior issues & plot domination about 1/3 through the series. Her father Danzinger, a cyborg named Yale and Bess (wife of Morgan) are the only salvageable characters of this series. The rest of the cast has practically zero storyline or dialogue.

Let us not forget the perpetually wounded pilot and the deranged spy doctor to try the viewers patience for repetition while the group stops their trek to become sitting targets for the ""attack of the week"" perpetrators. Then there is the whining, self-centered coward Morgan who was very irksome to watch. His character was finally redeemed with a better personality about 1/3 into the series.

Between the over hovering mother group leader, the Battlestar Galactica trek where they leave pristine, bountiful landscape behind for parched, arid, SW dead, unusable soil & the plodding pace of each episode were clear reasons why any network would have cancelled the series. It was also tiresome watching a lost in space or Battlestar Galactica type of group ground trek to a destination they never reach with a new hazard to battle each week. It was a wearisome formula. It is not necessary to place the cast in peril every week to make a show enjoyable to watch. It is a clear path to series failure. Viewers get tired of it very quickly.

Just building a new society on an alien planet with new technology to impress the scifi tech viewers would have created plenty of storyline opportunities. The series filming location should be northern California, not the desert SW. It's amazing the cast could tolerate such an abysmal filming location.

The terrians were truly some award winning alien designs. Very unique & believable appearance and the sounds they produced. Best I've were seen on any series... and as a lifelong scifi & star trek fan, that is saying something. The grendlers, however, should be left on the cutting room floor.

The network should have had the series reformatted by replacing the writers, re-pacing the episode to a faster rate, new episode directors, choosing a different group lead character & cleaning up the plot. It was a salvageable idea. They could still do something with a complete revamp of this series. A good idea, poorly handled.",1355875200,4,4169,4.9471428571428575

I had to give it a few episodes to hook me, but hook me it ultimately did. Much of Earth2 is pretty standard sci-fi fare, but the things that are new and interesting make this something more than the usual genre mishmash given to us by the networks.

Humanity has messed up in the biggest possible way and Earth is no longer habitable - at all. For generations, people have been living on space stations that orbit earth and the moon and we have taken our problems and our hierarchies to the space stations with us along with a few problems we didn't foresee, like the fact that many children born in the sterile atmosphere of the stations are subject to a mortal illness referred to only as the syndrome. Devon Adair is a wealthy young mother who is hoping to take her son to a habitable planet where he and other children like him will be cured. She has gathered 250 families for this mission and is awaiting permission to leave. Her expedition is sabotaged but she and a few others get away and are stranded on the planet. A planet on which they are not alone. The indigenous inhabitants are hard to understand, but peaceful in the extreme unless threatened. But, other humans have been there too, scientists and penal colonists, used to test the capacity of the planet. These and other dangers, as well as the political machinations of the government back home and a spy in the midst of the group make up the action.

There is more here than originally meets the eye. For sci-fi junkies who have watched all of their favorites so many times they can recite the dialogue, be patient and give Earth 2 a try.",1334620800,,1717,4.482428115015974

2295123,4,B0009JE6G6,"Earth 2 is an intriguing and entertaining sci-fi series that had a lot of potential but where unfortunately something went amiss and the show was cancelled long before its time.

So let's start with the premise which is the world 200 years into the future where humans have made planet Earth so uninhabitable that it is pretty much mostly a toxic wasteland. The solution: building space stations that orbit the planet. Entire generations are now born on these sterile stations, never even seeing Earth. The only information most humans living on these stations have on Earth is from stories and legends. From what we gather, Earth is so toxic that burning wood is considered a crime and the atmosphere is so contaminated that exposure to the elements is impossible. As a result of existence outside of their natural environment, some people have developed illnesses, the so called ""Syndrome"", that does not allow them to live past childhood. One such individual is the son of billionaire Devon Adair, Ulysses Adair (or Uly). Having the money and resources, she puts together a team of colonists to travel with her to the Earth-like planet in the G8 system 22 lightyears away. Government officials have other plans for them though and in an attempt to defy these officials, Adair and her team decide to go on the trip by escaping authorities. After 22 years of cryoststic stasis, the crew awakens and shortly after crash lands on the planet. Now, suddenly stranded on this strange planet on the other side of the galaxy,  without any of the equipment they came with, the colonists have to find ways to make do - looking for the basics of life: food, water and shelter. To make matters worse, their communicator dish has landed on the wrong side of the continent, necessitating that they embark on a long journey to the far coast to meet up at the planned coordinates in a place known as Pacifica.

From a sci-fi perspective they could not have picked a better and more intriguing theme. First of all, it is fascinating to have a glimpse into a future in which the very basic things we take for granted today become rarities and luxuries, such as clean water from a spring, dirt and earth that you can touch without a haz mat suit, sunlight on your skin, breathing in air that has not been filtered and sanitized in any shape, picking up a fruit from a tree and eating it... This show did a great job at laying out the rather abysmal future that human kind finds itself in while at the same time offering hope by letting these people discover this planet that is so much like Earth before the fall. Another interesting aspect of the show was the socio-economic background around the show: hug class chasms, ordered lives on stations, authoritative government most likely in power through undemocratic means, inherited debt, indentured servitude and of course worst of all, a future in which they are incapable of sustaining life on the only planet hospitable to them. In a way humans are orphans, driven off their planet at their own hands and now they have to find a new home or else go extinct in two generations. There is a great scene in the beginning of their journey where it starts to rain one day and everyone immediately panics and takes shelter because from Earth they don't know rain to be anything but toxic. It doesnt even occur to them that it might not be. When they then find out that it in fact is clean, the wave of relief and joy that sweeps across their faces is quite touching. I thought that scene to be powerful as it gave us a glimpse into the grim reality humans find themselves in the not too distant future.

I also like shows in which a group of people just become stranded somewhere without any means of getting home, trying to survive. Earth 2 is all about survival and the adventure: traversing the vast land, looking for the basics of life, setting up camp, encountering strange phenomena, landscapes and creatures. There is also a mysticism to it as related to these human settlers and the native life they encounter. The feeling  that they are the only humans on this planet further gives the show that feeling of desolation and solitude. In fact, after watching this show for a while even the audience feels claustrophobic and confined - mirroring the feeling the colonists have on this planet where they are stuck and lost. The big, great unknown. This show was sort of like the rough it out, wagon-train meets sci-fi on a strange Earth-like planet. Such scenarios open opportunities for exploring a myriad number of story arcs and themes and Earth 2 definitely took the right direction.

I also liked that petty soap-opera type of emotions were left out to really focus on the story and the journey.  These days most shows feel like deep psychological exposs of the characters; sort of like a soap opera but more complicated. Every theme and show, no matter how trivial, has to morph into some sort of psychological analysis of its characters, which can get tiring and taxing. Real people don't behave like that in real life. Earth 2 depicts characters that are real instead of constantly in their heads being psychoanalyzed by the writers and the audience.

Unfortunately, despite such a strong promise in the premise of the story, the deliverance left some things to be desired. There are many episodes that are just beautifully written as well as being intelligent and thoughtful but instead of going on on that strong note, episodes were interspersed in there where you just have to wonder why the writers squandered all that opportunity. The slow episodes might really have driven the audience away so early on.

Another problem was that chemistry was missing between the characters, especially between Devon and Danzinger and Julia and Alonzo. You just cant feel it. I also think that the show just became too slow for people after a while. I mean here you got this group of people landed on a strange planet and all they do is treck and camp and have weird experiences. No action is happening, no tension, no real drama - it's all in the woods, earthy colors, rugged gear - nothing fancy. There us also no sci-fi jargon and futuristic sets - it just feel like here and people didn't want to see that. I think that is why the show eventually got cancelled, it had the right themes and philosophy but that vision was not realized such that it was  gripping.

Here are some of the questions that arise when watching the show, at least for me:

* If these people have the kinds of technologies that allow them to travel light years, go into cryostatic stasis, grow horses in a canteen basically, and genetically engineer humans for specified professions, why could they not find a way to make earth habitable?

* With all these genetic engineering tools at their disposal, why could they not have simply engineered the ""syndrome"" out of everyone - before birth. Apparently not everyone has it so there must be a gene for it, which they could have isolated given their sophisticated tools.

* The cryostatic mode of traveling long distances did not make sense. In the beginning they state that some of the people on the ship, like Alonzo, were just hired hands to drop off the colonists. Yet they go into cryostatic sleep for 22 year with the rest, meaning 22 years have passed. How did those people think this was going to work out? They go back home after 44 years when everything they knew changed and aged for nearly half a century. Who would do that? It basically means throwing away your life and leaving behind the life you know. You can't say ""bye honey, see you in 44 years when you are 70 and I'm still 25"". Also, in those 22 years the crew was in stasis, new technologies may have developed that could put a whole new spin to the journey or maybe the government changed etc. And what about the government officials that run the stations. Were they waiting for 22 years in order to get their informant get in touch with Hiller? The whole sleeping for decades thing just did not make much sense. It's one thing to go away for a job for 6 months or a year or 5 years, it is quite something else to go into stasis for decades as part of a job, not age while everyone around you does, then wake up and just move on like you hadnt just lapsed through a couple of generations essentially. That part was just a little out of focus.

* How did these people manage to not look malnourished and emaciated given that we never see them hunt anything or any other mammals for that matter in the show and given that this planet seems like a barren, arid desert. They all looked well fed and healthy which is not likely when you are on an almost year long camping trip/trek cross country trekking through the roiguh wilderness and trying to overcome a harsh winter without any reliable sources of food. Surely people cannot look like that while feasting on fruits and berries - which is the only thing we ever see them look for.

But these are just a few of the details I think could have been worked out better. Overall I think this was a very entertaining as well as quite intriguing series which I am sure would have taken up during season 2 had the network given it some time. There was just so much potential but the writers and producers failed to make it stand out early on for the network to keep and the audience be enticed. Of course for the fast-paced, Jersey-shore generation of today this show would seem too slow and not as ""hip"" or ""cool"". Earth 2 is more like a slow cooked savory meal that has to be taken in equally slowly and with patience. Most TV shows are like colorful, spicy, south-of-the-border, conspiracy theory hors d'oeuvres: pick a little bit of everything here and there, create hotness, sex and explosions and call it a show. I really like that in Earth 2 it WASNT all about who is doing whom and who is hooking up with whom.  It is pure adventure while at the same time intelligently tackling issues of environmentalism, justice, redemption, metaphysics, social justice etc.

I just recently found the promo video for season 2 of Earth 2, completely ""rethought, restyled and retooled"" - while i was repulsed - on YouTube. The revamping would have meant they reach Pacifica,  Yale gets written off the show as well as the Terrains apparently, and Morgan is said to just have ran away so now Bess can focus on ""new romances"" in this new colony (read: soap opera). Needless to say that the re-imagined what would have been season 2 does not look very promising, mainly because getting there is half the fun. I mean THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT of the show: traveling through an unknown planet and braving challenges. And as much I dislike Morgan, he provided comic relief and I do like it when unlikable people redeem themselves as their role in the group manifests and rise above the occasion. Morgan had that potential - just as Yale. Anyway the promo didn't look very worthwhile, in fact it looked pretty disappointing, so maybe we should all be glad it wasn't continued - at least not on that note. These people came to this planet with the hope of finding a way to heal humanity. Without a real continuation we will never find out what happens to those people: if they reach Pacifica and get to establish their colony, what other adventures await them on the long journey there, if the Council pursues them, their relation to the Terrians, the other alien lives they may have encountered, whether Devon and Danzinger finally come around, if Alonzo and Julia ever take the next step and whether Uly will ever get to slay his monsters...",1315785600,4,11598,4.61863173216885
2295124,4,B0009JE6G6,"This is going to be a short review because I'm only going to bring up what others didn't.

I recall watching an episode or two of this show when it originally aired. At the time, I didn't think much of the show, especially since Clancy Brown starred in it. I'm used to him playing bad-guy roles and felt his presence didn't fit in a sci-fi show. However, a few years after that, I caught the reruns and decided to give it a fair chance. I admit Earth 2 began to grow on me. I started to look forward to each upcoming episode. I got into the characters' hopes and fears and their interaction with alien life on the planet.

Now to what irritated me about Earth 2:

1. Morgan (John Gegenhuber) as a character quickly got on my nerves. He wasn't a team player and acted impulsively most of the time. I desperately wanted him to fall off a cliff and break his neck. Yeah, he's that annoying and so is his wife. Why they wrote his character into the show is a mystery to me because Morgan did nothing to propel the story.

2. The special effects for big explosions were amateurish. Rather than rely on the CGI of the time, they should've used real explosives or paid for a better effects artist.

3. Did anyone notice how many times they used an ""eagle"" sound clip in each episode. Every time they showed an outdoor scene, you'd hear the sound of an eagle flying overhead, sometimes more than once. It's a minor complaint but it got old real fast.",1313452800,,1442,4.325925925925926
2295125,5,B0009JE6G6,"Good little mini, especially for the money. I actually sold a copy I had and then bought it back a year later.
*minor Spoilers on first episode only

This was an early sci-fi channel series. Lately it seems to me that science fiction has grown much more 'socially acceptable'; it used to be only geeks that would admit to watching it. But with shows like Battlestar, Eureka and [the new]Dr. Who,  to 'combo' fantasy/sci-fi shows like Merlin and S33k3r, it is gaining popularity. One of the reasons is marketability...they are learning how to appeal to broader audiences. For example, as much as I love this series, it IS a bit campy in parts; kind of like a Star Trek holdover (next gen.)

So this series does have a few scenes that lack finesse; perhaps even an entire episode. The narration (warning, the entire show has a narrated opening and closing)for example, could have been done much better, or just done away with completely. There are not many shows or movies that stand strong after a long narrated intro. Its like the writers were lazy, or lacked creativity. Even so, it is still worth watching. It is time-date able. It is an obvious early 90s show, just like next gen. I'm not sure what year it was that writers figured out how to cut out lame contemporary hairstyles, but I DO know it happened between 1995 and now :)

The premise of the show is a group of settlers leave Earth to colonize a new planet, as the past generation of humans have destroyed it. Now, barely able to sustain the overpopulation, this team is a beacon of hope for the planet as they will assure that the new home, Earth2, is ready for all the others. Of course, the corporations have other ideas, as corporations often do when it involves money and power, and the team suddenly finds itself alone. They travel 50 light years or so with no home contact, and are forced to team up and settle with no reinforcements coming.

The planet is hostile as well as welcoming. I will say no more about it except that it is wrapped up in 21 episodes. Its a good enough ride and much of the premise of the 'new' planet was cool, just not enough budget or interest to make it better, as was common in those days. (Anyone remember 'Lost Room'?)

One last thing (you will thank me later), the last two episodes on the DVDs are 'bonus' episodes. They were left out of TV rotation but included in the DVD box....DO NOT watch them last. They are mediocore at best and you will, as I did, think the last episode is the third last and be way dissappointed when you realize what they did so I am recommending that you watch the two bonus episodes 'natural born grendlers' and 'flower child' somewhere in the middle; try both either after episode 9 or after episode 14.
Just make sure 'all about eve' is your last episode.

If this show where to be remade using the technology of today, this show would be truly amazing.  I do enjoy the story line, but this is coming from someone who thoroughly enjoys sci-phi concepts.",1278547200,,695,4.642276422764228

2295136,1,B0009JE6G6,"Earth 2 was brutally bad. It made less and less sense as each episode progressed.
Doctor is a criminal OK. So that gets drawn out, why, it's a mystery we don't really
care about. Woman in charge is in charge because, well her name says she's in charge.
Pilot and co pilot appear to be useless on the ground. Yet, most of the people grew up,
born and raised on a space station and many lacked any technical ability.  The people were
all incompetent. If they had the professor from Gilligan's Island or even Gilligan they
would have been more successful. I give almost all sci fi shows a chance but watching these
 confused people change from just confused to confused and annoying even to each other was dreadful.
Cheap sets do not make a show bad, Dr Who and plunger armed Daleks for example. The acting
was fine. The actors provided what was required of them by the writers who gave
the actors insipid and nauseating lines and situations. Yes, there were aliens.
They were gray, did not say much and just looked uncomfortable. This show should not even be
in a landfill on Earth but sent into space so it does not taint society with it existence.
Lastly, I just do not care about the environmental message in the show. It makes
you want a to strip mine just so the noise would distract you from ever thinking of this show.",1263340800,6,1323,4.440329218106996

2295140,3,B0009JE6G6,"I missed this when it first ran in the early nineties, but I was always curious about it, especially since one of the Lone Gunmen from ""The X Files"" made a comment about it.  Ever since then I had to check out ""Earth 2.""

Although I'm a big science-fiction fan, ""Earth 2"" is not quite engaging enough.  It's not horrible, but it's not great either.  If you watch it after 10 P.M. and you find yourself falling asleep, you might conclude that you're just tired.  Or maybe it's that coupled with the subconscious realization that the ""Earth 2"" story isn't moving along with anything remotely akin to rising action.  It sort of plods along, telling an interesting story, but never quite gripping your attention enough to say, ""Wait until you see what happens next.""

All the complaints about the show are valid.  These include but are not limited to:

1) Too much focus is placed on the girl and boy in the first few episodes, leading to the suspicion that this is a kiddie show;
2) Clancy Brown needs to get his Kurgan (sp?) on, whip out a broadsword and take charge (Tim Curry: ""Charge!"");
3) Group leadership is weak and unfocused, or as Higgy Baby would say, ""Sorely lacking"";
4) No one is especially cautious when exploring ""Earth 2"" (I mean, beings pop out of the ground all the time!);
5) Camp security is abysmal (that one guy is ALWAYS asleep with his gun);
6) Cacti (or cactuses, if you prefer the new English) are on ""Earth 2"" (well I'll be!);
7) The captain of the ship in episodes one and two has white hair and black eyebrows and doesn't exude ""captain-ness"" at all;
8) The stories do not usually make for compelling viewing (sorry about putting two ""ings"" next to each other);
9) Anthony Sabato Jr. exudes the early nineties (really, check his hair), giving the show a somewhat dated look (if you think that's bad, check out the ""Starlost"" series).
10) No one seems to realize that they'd all be dead without Danziger (the Clancy Brown character).  Show some appreciation.

Good things about the show:
1) Terry O'Quinn (a favorite actor of mine);
2) Clancy Brown (another favorite actor of mine);
3) Debrah Farentino (although not as ""hot"" as she is now [OLDER!]; see ""Eureka"" the TV series);
4) The Terrians are very well-done alien life forms;
5) Tim Curry chews up the scenery and brings the acting level up a bit.

Finally, a note regarding the packaging.  The DVDs do not have full-disc labels on either side, so it's all silver here, silver there.  Also, shows like this make me question whether or not my DVD player/recorder is about to give up the ghost.  A double-sided DVD is never desired, as far as I'm concerned, because you've always got to worry about fingerprinting either side, plus there's always the ""which is Side A and which is Side B?"" or, instead, ""if I put the disc with the little ""Side A"" label facing up, will the Side A shows come on or the Side B ones?""  These ""Earth 2"" discs seemed to stick much more frequently than other shows I've seen (which generally don't stick at all).

2295144,4,B0009JE6G6,"Earth 2 is one of those series that goes down easy. Unfortunately it ended to quickly with an un-resolved story line. The series started slowly for me as I was not sure what to expect and getting use to the characters is always challenging in the beginning of all series. After getting the characters down and enjoying the great New Mexico landscape, I was pleasantly surprised. The story lines were not ""The West Wing"" mind you, but enjoyable.
The best part of viewing the series was the eye candy of Devon, Bess and Dr Julia. All three ladies are ones to die for, but moody and broody Dr Julia was my favorite. Not as striking as the other two but still had a strong allure, and well cast.
My only negative besides the series not concluding was the mix up of the episodes at the end. It seemed to me that the ""All About Eve"" episode was the final one for the season, but the box set has ""Flower Child"" as the final. No big deal, it's Universal what can you say.

2295147,4,B0009JE6G6,"I saw the first few episodes of Earth 2 when it was broadcast and thought it was interesting, but I was never able to finish watching due to the combination of NBC's scheduling shenanigans and events in my personal life.  Fast forward fourteen years or so and I was trying to ""round out"" a shipment and thought this might be something interesting to include.

OH WOW.  Maybe it was the difference in my age or the difference in society but this time it was well beyond ""interesting.""  It was relevant, mostly coherent and actually included situations with characters having to deal with consequences well after the end of an episode.

Scientific inaccuracies abound (I cringe every time I hear the phrase ""22 light years""); there are times when the writers are clearly trying to get in our faces and/or tease us; and there are two or three episodes where the plot is so obvious and contrived as to be silly.  But the characterizations are strong and the ideas worthy of far more than the brief look episodic television allowed.  The cliffhanger ending was a big disappointment but if you look around on Google you can find out why it happened and why it was better than the alternative.

If you're looking for hard, gritty SF, you won't find it here.  While the premise is a dystopia/utopia dichotomy the show was deliberately designed to be family-friendly, so many sordid details are necessarily left up to the viewer's imagination (and in a manner where kids wouldn't quite understand the seamy sides).  In addition, the show focuses more on interpersonal relationships and consequences as opposed to plotlines driven directly from scientific concepts.

While the show was excellent, I can't say the same about the DVD set itself.  The quality of the DVDs, in fact, pulled my review down an entire star.

The set is four double-sided DVDs which have proven to be very finicky and difficult to play on PCs.  In addition, the prints are muddy and dark -- I have a hard time believing that the colors in NM aren't more vivid -- and the audio quality is so-so at best.  I'm not the type to rate DVDs on ""extras"" but I can confirm the reports from other reviews that they're nice but not spectacular.

Worst of all, in my book, is the fact that the episodes are presented in broadcast order instead of chronological order.  Three of them (""After the Thaw,"" ""Natural Born Grendlers"" and ""Flower Child"") are thus out of place.  For a semi-serialized series this is a major issue and it would not have been difficult to re-order the episodes when the set was being created.  This reeks of a slap-dash-out-the-door production.

That being said, I'm glad I got the product and I'm happy to share it with others.  I just wish that the show hadn't gotten such short shrift, both by being cut down before its time and by being released on a flimsily constructed DVD set.",1233446400,5,2860,4.6913827655310625

2295161,4,B0009JE6G6,"I recently rediscovered E2 on dvd and realized that even though it hardly made a splash back when it was on in 1994, it's a show that would be more resonant if it were on today considering the latest trends toward creating a more green environment.  Why?  Well, if you've read earlier reviews, by now you know what it's about: not too far into the future, the Earth is all but extinct and humans live on space stations orbiting above Earth.  A lack of an actual earthlike atmosphere leads a mother and her dying son to search for an alternate earthlike planet 22 light years away.  Of course their plan to colonize the new planet goes disastrously wrong when their ship crashes and strands them and their eclectic crew thousands of miles away from their intended destination and they must make their way across an strange planet full of obstacles.

This show had a ton of potential.  When it hit its notes right, it was like the classic Twilight Zone:  a good dollop of science fiction, action, a bit of humor, some good drama and/or romance all packaged together with some insight into the human condition (""The Enemy Within"", ""Redemption"", ""Better Living Through Morganite part 2"").  It tackled many environmental issues effectively but still entertainingly, such as conservation of natural resources and the question of superiority of humans over animals and alien life (""Water"", ""Survival of the Fittest"").  But of course it's not perfect.  Some of the episodes are brilliant, others are schmaltzy or pale imitations of cheesy horror and scifi movies (""After the Thaw"", ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told"").  Notable actors include Jessica Steen as Dr. Julia Heller, career villain actor Clancy Brown (playing the good guy for once) as John Danziger, and my favorite, the funny and talented John Gegenhuber playing the whiny but occasionally sweet Morgan Martin.  But I don't think there is a weak link in any of the cast (even the child actors were good).

2295163,4,B0009JE6G6,"I really enjoyed this series, and found the premise fantastic.  What wonders we could have enjoyed if the show was just slightly different and allowed to continue.

The problem, I think, was that they just *didn't* explore the sci-fi aspects that they could have.  I felt like they couldn't make up their minds - Sci-fi, personal stories, or just an old west wagon train story.  I loved the first two episodes, and certainly the last, but too many in the middle were too lacking in intregue.  I think the over-riding issue that likely killed the ratings was the continued return to the 'kid did something stupid that we have to fix' routine.  So many elements of the show were great - why did they have to lower themselves to this silly plot mechanism?  It lowered the bar to a point that I think many simply stopped watching.

Overall, I still feel this show is worth watching.  There were some great episodes, some great sci-fi, and some really interesting & thought-provoking ideas.  I'm sad it was cancelled, but at least we are able to catch a glimpse into what they were trying to do with this DVD set.",1209168000,,1108,4.5786802030456855

While it has an interesting premise, and a couple of good actors, the character development is sadly lacking. The crashed crew is on a quest to locate the rest of those who were scattered over the planet's surface, and so they set off on a transcontinental hike, with their equipment breaking down or being sabotaged in almost every episode.
Also, it seems some character turns out to be the ""bad guy"" with startling regularity. The annoying True, the cardboard Dr. Heller, and even the found humans, including the one played by Tim Curry, and the friends of Clancy Johnson, who die for their apparent ""sins"" soon after being discovered.
It just gets tedious, and viewers must ask themselves, ""Why do I care about these worthless people?""
The character of Devon Adair should be the strongest, but she apparently cares about nothing about her sickly son, and is willing to repeatedly risk the entire company just to see him ""safe,"" as if that could really be assured on an alien world.
The Terrians are interesting at first but soon grow tedious, as do the Grendlers, and it becomes a contest of who will be the stupidest character in the cast, and who will endanger everyone else most and in the most annoying manner.
Doesn't anyone ever learn from their mistakes? Don't they ever feel like they should take some security measures? Or be careful when dealing with alien species, or even other humans who are on this world? And the Council is always in the background (unless it's in the foreground). They lie to everyone on the Earth satelite stations about the loss of the crew just for starters, and then they arrange for the vessel itself to blow up, and finally, when they discover that Ulysses (the boy) has some kind of symbiotic relationship with the native Terrians (he's so goody-goody looking in these episodes he reminds me of the Brady Bunch), they try to hijack that as well.
Who is the good guy in all of this? The natives? Clancy?

But I guess I was just wishing for more, because the Stories are engaging and offer some cool ideas, especially the story surrounding the Terrians. There is apparently some Bonus Features on Disc 4. I haven't watched them yet, some Previews, Deleted Scenes and Outtakes. I would love just once the creators would make several versions for people to watch... perhaps Extended version with all the Deleted material added back into the particular episodes. Because I hate having to remember ""ok where was that scene at."" Anyway, there is some Cheesy previews of a Really Bad Sci-Fi show that came out Cleopatra 2525, which I never saw because it wasn't my type of show, and also some preview of Sliders season 3. Like I said I haven't looked at the Bonus Stuff yet. I guess my favorite bit of it all is all the great acting...there really were a lot of good actors in this series. Some of which I am surprised to see when they pop up in an episode. If you got a favorite Sci-fi actor you are probably going to see them pop up often... Clancy Brown, Tim Curry, Terry O'Quinn all add great characters in this series.",1199059200,,2151,4.31358024691358
2295171,5,B0009JE6G6,The quality of the DUal Layer DVDs is great! I saw the entire series non stop!!! Thank you AMAZON!!,1199059200,,99,4.2631578947368425
2295172,5,B0009JE6G6,"Okay, there's a few unanswered questions, like Adair being put in stasis at the end of one episode and is found up and running around in the next episode without explanation???  And, it grew tiresome to keep having a misbehaving child (True) move the plot-lines along.  But, to off-set this, there's a fairly interesting imagination at work inventing new and diverse challenges for our little band of humans lost on a world that works ""differently"" than anything they've known.

There are a couple of reasons this show appeals to us.  There's the diversity of the characters.  And there's the allure of outerspace intertwined with a band of human pioneers discovering this new frontier. The unknown (which is what they awake to every day) has always been a big drawing point.

While some may believe that the series ended without a final resolve, it might be noted that the humans learn in the last episode that they are useful, if not vital to the planet's future, which is a very positive note to end on.

As Amazon.com did package Earth 2 well for shipment, I suspect the original packaging of the manufacterer caused some difficulty in viewing a few of these disks (or it might have been a slight production flaw?).

Regardless, Amazon.com made the return a painless and quick event - I can't speak more highly of how they handled my complaint.  And, the replacement worked perfectly.

I loved this show: Great cast, strong environmental message, fabulous landscapes, an intringuing attempt of making scifi without (or mostly) technology, strong female characters (Debrah Farentino, who's now in Eureka, Jessica Steen, Rebecca Gayheart). Now I look at LOST and despite all the evident differences I think EARTH2 Could have been a great show, given the chance. What about Life before Eden Adance?, what about Devon's cure?. As I said there were endless opportunities never taken.

I wish there were more extras in it, comments, deleted scenes...I personally loved the Score, but I guess it's because the show was made before all the fancy DVDs we have now....but it's a fair good edition for a show which was never really forgotten.",1172016000,6,899,4.907894736842105

Tessie Martinez",1171929600,3,78,5.0
2295183,4,B0009JE6G6,"I ordered this DVD set, having never seen an entire episode. I only remembered seeing parts of two or three episodes when they were actually aired. I was recommended it by a friend, who'd watched every episode faithfully until the show was abruptly canceled. Bummer.

The series follows the Eden Advance team, a group of colonists headed by Devon Adair, who (following a secret govenment plot to destroy their ship) crash land on the planet, losing most of their gear and passengers. A small group survives, and has to make a cross-continental trek to reach the intended landing site, in order to meet the main body of colonists, who are scheduled to arrive shortly. The series was abandoned mid-season in season 1.

I would have rated this item 5 stars, but the quality of the DVD encoding took away at least 1 1/2 stars. Since you can't give 1/2 star ratings, I rounded up. There were several times where the disk would freeze, there were a few spots that were horribly pixelated, and the sound got choppy. This usually was short-lived, however. The exception being that my disk set came with two disk 2s and no disk 3. One of the two duplicates actually was defective, so after two or three weeks of emails, got the publisher to send me a pre-paid envelope to return on of them in exchange for a disk 3. Obviously, I sent the defective one.

I've read several reviews where the reviewer talked about bad acting in the series. Honestly, I never saw this. The only exception was some of the acting by the two children in the series. Obviously, I expect child actors, especially 8 year olds, to have some issues with heavy emotionally-charged scenes. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, there are some of the finest actors in Hollywood represented, e.g. Jessica Steen (Armageddon, CSI and more TV shows than I can list), and Clancy Brown (best known as the Kurgan from Highlander, also in The Guardian (2006), Starship Troopers, etc.).

After sitting down and watching the series (keeping in mind that it was made 12 years ago so many of the props look dated) the one thing I'm left with is this sense of wondering what happened to the Eden Advance crew. Did they make it to New Pacifica? Did Danziger (Clancy Brown) ever get together with Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino)? Did anyone ever slap that annoying Morgan (John Gegenhuber)? I think it says alot that I came to care about these people, even after only 'getting to know them' for half a season of episodes. I think that several characters (Morgan) were played so well that I really felt like I knew that person - and in Morgan's case, wanted to see him slapped around a bit. I think that says alot about the acting, and the writing of the screenplays.

I've seen fan fiction online where people have continued the storyline, but it's not the same. I'm saddened to say that this show hasn't had the same cult following that Firefly had, so it's not likely that a feature film will be made from the story, giving us a glimpse of what ever became of these poor souls trapped on a distant planet.",1171670400,8,3058,4.583180987202925

The planet/island is weird, almost a living organism itself.  Some of the survivors die, some have strange connections to the planet/island, some are secretly working for the government/Others, and some of the people found to inhabit the planet/island are helpful while others not so much.  And to top if off, Terry O'Quinn stars in both series!  If you are a fan of ""Lost"", I strongly urge you to check out  ""Earth 2"".  Not the greatest show, sci-fi or otherwise, but definitely ahead of its time and should have been given at least 1 more season to let folks who had not been able to get into the show another chance at trying.

Besides the unending parade of stupid mistakes everyone continually makes on their trek across an UNEXPLORED ALIEN PLANET! (adopting cute alien ""kittys"", befriending  inexplicably encountered humans on a supposedly unexplored planet, lack of sentries, lack of leadership, etc. ad nauseam), I also had a hard time caring whether any of these schmucks lived or died.  I had hoped that Danziger (Clancy Brown, aka The Kurgan!) would take charge and beat this gang into shape, but he was just wishy-washy like all the rest.

  I won't go into detail either about all the basic science flaws except to point out that traveling 22 light years in 22 years (even assuming their dorky little ship could somehow manage this) brings up all sorts of cool relativistic possibilities which were conveniently skipped over.  Instead all we get is the convenient plot device of ""artificial gravity"" so they could avoid those pesky, expensive special effects shots.  Is that also the reason Earth 2 looks exactly like Earth 1?  >>sigh<<

  Overall this series wasn't exactly horrible.  With a little better character development I could probably even overlook the  glaring errors and cheap effects [Star Trek TOS comes to mind].  But if you can't empathize with the characters, is there any point in watching?  I guess not.

2295203,3,B0009JE6G6,"I love this series and was so glad to finally be able to get it on DVD.  The quality of the DVD's is excellent but I just can't give it a 5 star rating for several reasons.
1.  The bonus features are awful!  I could care less about seeing episodes of other shows, especially one I dislike and the episode from Sliders has to be one of the worse ones they could have picked.  I want to see interviews with people from the show I'm watching........:)
2.  One of the reasons I buy DVD sets is to sit back and relax and watch a show I love in chronilogical order.  One of the problems with trying to watch many shows on tv, especially ones with season arcs (like Buffy and Angel etc), is the constant reruns and out of sequence episodes.  So, I was VERY disappointed that the producers of this DVD set chose to put the episodes in AIRING order rather than follow the storyline.  It really does ruin the enjoyability of the set for me, especially since the episodes would have made more sense if shown in sequence.
Over all I would have to give the set 3 stars, even though the series itself deserves 5+.  I just have to subtract for bad packaging, bad extras etc.",1135123200,17,1159,4.255707762557078
2295204,5,B0009JE6G6,"Earth2, one of those shows that could have lasted 5-10 seasons but met its untimely demise after one season. Its demise was largely due to the constant shuffling and pre-empting of the show through its timeslots and airing-days; it was so badly shifted around that viewers just couldn't find it to watch it. None-the-less, this show had all the potential and I seriously enjoyed it. Earth2 was basically Wagon Train meets Gilligan's Island meets Lost in Space. A colony ship crashlands on planet G889 (Earth2) but they are in the wrong spot. They must travel across this new planet in order to get to New Pacifica so they can setup for the other 250 families supposedly already enroute to Earth2.

The main characters of the Eden Advance Colonists were Devon & Ulysses (Uly) Adair, John & True Danziger, Yale, Morgan & Bess Martin, Alonzo Solace, Dr Julie Heller and in the background were roughly 7-10 other characters that could be used as main characters if the series had continued. There were three species native to the planet that appeared regularly: Grendlers, Terrians, and the little rodent spikers. Unbeknownst to the colonists, this was a place the space stations also sent a multitude of convicts as a prison, the main one appearing early with Tim Curry as Gaal.

One of the down spots of the series is the Eden Advance Colony just kept running into humans (convicts, assassins, 'eco-terrorists', crashed ships).

On to the actual DVD presentation itself. I like the packaging, the menus are friendly, and there's an assortment of bonus features although I really don't need an episode of Cleopatra 2525 and Sliders included, it makes no sense other than as a blatant marketing ploy to get you the consumer to by those series also. I would have much rather had commentaries about the series by the cast members, what they liked about filming E2, what contributed to its demise, and if they had wished it to continue.

The episodes of Earth2 are set up in order of when they aired and unfortunately, the last to episodes on disc4 are chronologically out of order. ""Natural Born Grendlers"" should be viewed after the Gaal storyline (roughly episode 5) and ""Flower Child"" is actually the second to last episode of the series so should be watched before ""All About Eve"", but that's a lot of disc swapping.

It's a shame this series wasn't given a proper attempt at being a success, this could have been ""LOST"" only ten years earlier.",1134345600,11,2442,4.818615751789976

This series fell into the Hollywood sci-fi crap-trap in near record time (the use of a cute kid, smart dog or stupid robot). The writing was completely shot by the end of the first season.

As many others have already said it really would have been nice to have some input from the cast/crew.  And the packaging is not the greatest out there.  As with any series but scifi in particular, you have to take the good with the bad.  If you are looking for comedy buy a comedy and if you are looking for Shakespearean dialogue look elsewhere.  However if you consider yourself a TRUE scifi fan, then Earth 2 is a must.  There are those that say the stories have been done and the aliens are not original.  I can say the same for ANY scifi series out there.  Earth 2 takes these so called ""old"" themes and puts an original spin on them. That is what make it a great and original series. You also need to take into account that it was aired on a network which accounts for the limited budget, its untimely demise, and the cliffhanger ending that will never be resolved.  Having said all that if you are not a diehard scifi fan you will probably not like Earth 2, particular if you are unable to take the good with the bad. The bottom line is that this is a solid scifi series that without doubt does the genre justice.",1130112000,18,1292,4.215447154471545
2295207,4,B0009JE6G6,"Earth 2 was one of those `almost' programmes, making it beyond the pilot but failing to get renewed at the end of the first season. Its admirers, unable, in the end, to affect ""a Star Trek"" and win its reprieve, have been waiting and hoping for the series to make its DVD debut for some time.

The premise is solid: in 2192 overcrowding and pollution is manifesting itself in congenital illness among Earth's children. Against government policy, a private expedition - the vanguard of an intended colonisation - sets out for an Earth-like planet 22 light years away, in hopes of securing a future for their children. After their ship crash-lands of the wrong side of the planet, the rag-tag survivors set out overland, discovering on the way that their new home has more than a few surprises in store for them.

From this cracking and well-realised beginning, Earth 2 settles down to a series of encounters, crises and obstacles. There is a story through-line, but many of the episodes stand on their own, and indeed, some of them played out of sequence (strangely reproduced on the DVD) when the series first aired. The cast is as solid as the premise - a strong through sometimes overbearing female lead (Debrah Farentino) is nicely balanced by a gruff, down-to-earth male lead (Clancy Brown). Other key characters include the expedition's doctor, who has a guilty secret to hide; the ship's pilot, who expected to drop the colonists off without ever setting foot on the planet himself; the self-serving government agent, who doesn't take well to a life without luxuries; and his wife, who's in every way a better person than him, but loves him anyway.

With a great look, an involving premise, and intriguing, three-dimensional characters, there's much to admire about this series, though it has its weaknesses too. The obligatory ""cute-but-irritating-children"" are unfortunately present and correct and landing everyone in trouble, and early on there's even an attempt at introducing the obligatory ""cute-but-irritating-animal-companion"" - though fortunately it's exposed as a pest and barely heard from again. Three-episode guest star Tim Curry plays a duplicitous castaway who runs close to pantomime villainy at times (although that disingenuous, dangerous grin of his is always a welcome sight to those of us who've followed his career since Rocky Horror days). Some of the science is distinctly dodgy (naturally-occurring electro-magnetic vacuum tubes that provide instant transport over thousands of miles - oh, really?), but some is pretty damn neat (`gear' communicators, burrowing bullets). There's a strong thread of mysticism running through the series, particularly in the expedition's experience of the `primitive' native races. It brings another element to the plot and presents the characters with some interesting dilemmas, but much of the time it feels a little half-baked and simplistic - the gospel according to Greenpeace with a touch of peyote shamanism thrown in. There are standout episodes that boast fine acting and challenging, thought-provoking storylines (Survival of the fittest), and others that feel like retreads of ideas that are already pretty familiar (After the thaw). As a personal high-point, seeing Clancy Brown play the good guy is always a delight.

For fans the important thing, of course, is finally having all the episodes available on DVD - which is just as well, as the extras are nothing to get excited about. The bloopers are amusing enough, but ""bonus"" episodes of Cleopatra 2525 and Sliders are a waste of space, and the deleted scenes are probably a ""watch once only"" feature. Unfortunately missing are some juicy commentaries, and - most regretted of all - any word from the producers and writers on what was planned for the series. Cancellation saw Earth 2 end for good on a cliff-hanger; the DVD was probably the only chance we had to find out what was supposed to have happened next. Still, perhaps not knowing is part of the attraction - there's nothing like having to use your own imagination!",1130112000,11,4054,5.128593040847202
2295208,3,B0009JE6G6,"Earth2 came out in 1994 and I caught a few of the first episodes.  They were interesting, but being a fan of hard sci-fi and humor, they just didn't do as much for me as they could of.  Well, when it came out on DVD I decided to watch it, from start to finish.  Maybe I would enjoy it more now that time had passed?  And I did enjoy some parts - the characters are all well developed (or still developing), some of the science - like the gear, Zero, the equipment - were well thought out and the aliens were interesting.  And many of the female actors were hot.
But much of the science was fantasy. I'm just not into soft sci-fi in a TV series. Also, there was little, to no, humor and stories were not very strong.  Two ghost stories in the same season?  How many times did the Hummer and other groundcraft break down?  How many people were in the crew total?  New people seemed to pop up every few episodes!  There was even time travel on the dreamscape!
Also, while the DVDs have the episodes in order in which they were aired, episode 20 should be viewed before episode 05 and episode 21 should be viewed after 17.  Otherwise they don't make any sense.  The extras are mixed - the blooper reel and deleted scenes were interesting, but why have a Slider bonus episode and a Cleopatra 2525 bonus episode? Surely they had more they could have placed on the DVD about behind-the-scenes or interviews?",1129939200,15,1400,4.342307692307692
2295209,4,B0009JE6G6,"Earth 2 was a really great show. My absolute favourite at the time. The characters and the scenery were all gorgeous and the storyline original and interesting. It's set in a future when the Earth is all used up and most people live in orbit on huge satellites. Amongst the space population a growing number of children are being born with a deadly syndrome that it is hoped may be cured if they could live in the natural environment of a planet. There is only one planet, 22 light years from Earth that has the potential for colonisation. Wealthy ""Syndrome"" families fund an independant mission to the planet, but their advance party is sabotaged and they crash onto the planet thousands of miles away from the chosen landing spot. With only two years before the hundreds of families on the colony ships arrive, they must salvage what little they can from the crash and travel overland to their original destination. As if their task isn't difficult enough with the aliens and the hardships of travel, they also must contend with the unknown saboteurs.

Earth 2 was ahead of its time with its strong female leads, and like all of the truly original and innovative sci-fi and fanciful shows it was cancelled before it even got through a full season. Most of the more modern shows like Firefly and Wonderfalls at least don't end with the main character in hideously dire straits, leaving you with a terrible feeling of doom and panic whenever you think about how it ended. Why oh why couldn't they have ended Earth 2 with more optimism? Why didn't they ever at least make a movie to finish the bloody storyline?

Aside from the awful ""stopping"" of the series, my only complaint is: ""Why didn't they put the episodes in order on the DVD?"" Natural Born Grendlers comes after A Memory Play, and Flower Child should come before the final episode, not both of them tacked on at the end as they were when the series first aired. They could have rectified this on the DVD, but they didn't! Are they complete idiots, or are some of their bits missing?

Anyway, aside from that, Earth 2 is still a great watch. Maybe not as witty as a Joss Whedon production, but still above average in its entertainment quota. It hasn't aged at all. It's still attractive and entertaining. Nice quality transfer. (I don't like the double-sided DVDs, but that's no big deal, you just have to be extra careful handling them.)

What are the major problems? Nothing quite gells, the acting is woeful to say the least, with not a single exception. And obviously every expense was spared when it came to both the script and the special effects. And finally where is the humor, the humanity? I appreciate that the stranded humans are up against the odds in a desolet and hostile new home, but everything is always down beat or confrontational. It got to the stage where I'd cheer if one of the characters wa maimed or killed. For a show to succeed, you must at least care for the characters. I wouldn't want one of them living on my street. And finally, finally, this cheap and nasty series was reinforced by a cheap and nasty DVD product. Episodes out of order and that nasty 2 sided DVD that is becoming alarmingly popular.

So when I came across this series I thought that maybe we'd give it a try and maybe we'll come upon a little known gem. The show which started off semi-interesting seemed to falter as it went on. All secrets revealed before the end the episode, all life forms present and accounted for by the first episode, all mystery all but gone. If there was character development that may have helped the show but there wasn't any and the characters on the show just didn't have anything about them to make you root for their success or failure. The acting was pretty bad, the props were pretty bad, and the storyline just couldn't find its hook.

2295219,4,B0009JE6G6,"Ah the 90's.  When we were spoiled with so many sci-fi shows that we could barely watch them all! These were the days of Space Above and Beyond on Fox, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Seaquest on NBC and Earth 2 on NBC.

I stand by my opinion that the Broadcast Networks are the death of a Sci-Fi show even before its green lit.  They demand ratings that are too high and tend to shift their programming so much that you can never watch the show! Then the network cancels the show citing ""poor ratings"".

I remember Earth 2 when i was a teenager.  I saw its pilot eppisode on TV and always tried to catch it on TV.  I even remember the cliffhanger at the end of the season, and prayed taht it would get renewed for a second season.  I guess we'll never know what happened to the colonists.

Don't listen to all the critics.  Be happy that Earth 2 even MADE it to DVD. I saw the release info on a website and my jaw dropped.  I mean, it was a one season show back in the mid-90's.  It's a miricle that we even got it released to watch.  Besides, its better than the alternative:  Old-broken VHS that we recorded it on back in the day.

It's a great set for any Earth 2 fan.  I would have loved to have a comentary by the creators on the pilot ep.  But hey, that's just a dream.",1126051200,8,1271,4.044176706827309
2295220,4,B0009JE6G6,"Others have written reviews of the show which I generally agree with. It was one of NBCs unsung good shows and the low ratings could likely be blamed on its timeslot, Sundays and 7pm, and the fact that it was pre-empted so often that you never knew whether they would ever show all of the episodes. Excruciatingly bad changes were tagged for the second season to kick up the ratings, so thankfully there was no second season.

I'm incredibly happy that the set has been released, but the episodes are listed in the order they actually were broadcast, rather than in story order. There is a crucial difference in order that viewers of the DVD set should follow.

""Natural Born Grendlers"" is listed as the 21st episode, but should be watched just prior to ""Water"". There is a plot device introduced in NBG that shows up again later in the series.

Additionally, ""Flower Child"" is the last episode on the DVD set, but should be the episode before ""All About Eve"".

All that being said, the bigger drawback to this set is the awful encoding. Lot's of color banding, unusual color splotches that look to be artifacts of attempts to render episodes broadcast safe, and lots of mosquito noise plague the episodes. Maybe rather than sticking two needless extras on the discs, Universal might have taken a little better care of the transfers.

However, this is definitely worth buying for both fans of the show and SF fans looking for something a little more cerebral than Star Trek: Voyager.",1125014400,5,1483,4.710424710424711

Any show of strength is reserved for the white woman lead, while the white males are either portrayed as foul human beings or drop their eyes with guilt. Gaaaa!

2295228,4,B0009JE6G6,"Given the hostile territory for Sci-Fi/Fantasy on network television, it's amazing this show got an airing at all, much less an entire season.  For the Sci-Fi fan, this will make a nice, if frustrating, addition to their collection (a cliff-hanger ending and no fan novels to complete that which was left unanswered).  With low-tech and a familiar premise (humans colonizing an, oops, populated alien planet) this series ages relatively well (but takes place a good deal of time after the description's date of 2192!).  Gathering elements from the Frank Herbert book, ""Dune"" and striking an eerie resemblance to the popular new TV series ""Lost"" (Terry O'Quinn was a featured guest), it does what Sci-Fi does well.  Instead of focusing on the aliens or the technology, it asks how we, as humans, remain human in the face of aliens and technology -- or do we revise that which we call ""human?""  When a friend asked if the aliens were good or bad, I had to tell her to watch the series.  The choice to have lots of ""grey area"" and complex issues gave this series the potential for an intriguing, if unrealized, future.  If there are any stumbles, it would be the typical ones brought about by network demands for mass palatability.  Attempts at romance fall flat.  The ""gorgeous woman/dork"" pairing of Rebecca Gayheart and John Gegenhuber is as unbelievable as that combination is on the plethora of TV sitcoms today.  Debrah Farentino and Clancy Brown actually seem to have negative chemistry, owing in no small part to the strident and frequently irritating tone written for her character.  The only pairing that seems to come close to working is Jessica Steen and Antonio Sabato, Jr.  While he is pretty enough for any woman to get worked up about, Ms. Steen's performance is subtle and layered, and therefore infinitely more believable.  The kid factor is a pain early on, but the producers wisely tone that down after the first few episodes.  Guest stars like Tim Curry and Virginia Madsen make for intriguing mysteries when the core group needs energizing.  On a last note, DVD producers need to think about the order that they place episodes in for DVD release.  Typically, they go for broadcast order.  In this case, that is a huge mistake - not only because of the sequential nature of the series, but because world events (the first gulf war) pre-empted critical episodes which were ""dumped"" at the end of the season when it was clear the show would not be renewed.  The episode listed as 19 (""All About Eve"") is actually the finale.  The two episodes after that ""Natural Born Grendlers""/ep 20 and ""Flower Child""/ep 21 should be watched in sequence (20 would fall sometime between eps 04 and 06, 21 is most likely the ""real"" 18).",1123632000,6,2736,4.8076923076923075

Watching ""AAE"" and ""FC"" in the order the DVDs present them is really not a problem, but ""Natural Born Grendlers"" introduces the ""geolock,"" something that plays a prominent role in the ""Better Living Through Morganite, Parts 1 & 2."" Thus, I would recommend viewers skip to ""NBG"" before continuing to the ""BLTM"" episodes.

Otherwise, a strangely engrossing and compelling series.  With the success of Sci-Fi Channel's (an NBC channel) ""Sci-Fi Friday,"" maybe NBC suits will consider reviving the series on Sci-Fi.  I'm certain there would be an appreciative audience.",1123200000,8,762,5.178861788617886
2295230,4,B0009JE6G6,"In the future the Earth is toast. With the planet little more than a dead rock in space with orbiting space stations supporting the bulk of the surviving population of the planet,  Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino) pays for an expedition to a recently charted Earth-like planet 22 light years away when a mysterious illness begins to slowly kill her son Ulysses. When the ship crash lands thousands of miles away from its intended landing area these explorers find themselves stranded on the wrong side of their new home.

Led by Devon and John Danzinger (the marvelous Clancy Brown who also does the cartoon character voice for Mr. Krabbs on ""Spongebobsquarepants"", the videogame voice for Dr. Neo Cortex in the ""Crash Bandicoot"" games and appeared in the classic film ""The Shawkshank Redemption"" among many others) on the long difficult journey,  these settlers encounter a number of  rather unpleasant native life forms including Grendlers and a race called the Terrians. The Terrians can sprout out of the ground instantly like weeds which and appear threatening at first. They also seem to have some sort of psychic link to both Ulysses  (Joey Zimmerman) and the pilot of the Alonzo (Antonio Sabato Jr).

""Earth 2"" always reminded me of ""Lost in Space"" during it's first season with its story of a group of colonists trapped on an alien world and at the mercy of its environment. No series like this would be complete without its own Dr. Smith and we get one in the form of Morgan Martin (John Gegenhuber). A thoughtful, well written show that used the science fiction genre as a parallel of the settlement of the American West, ""Earth 2"" received the short end of the stick with NBC yanking and moving the series around so often on their Sunday night schedule that fans finally gave up trying to find the series. That's too bad as the ensemble cast had just started to gel and the series began to pick up steam mid-stream suggesting a lot of interesting developments in the story arc developed for the show.

Although the network DID express some interest in bringing the show back, evidently NBC wanted to retool the show making it more of an action-adventure series. I'm guessing but I suspect they also would want to recast many of the key roles for the series as well. Perhaps it's just as well the series didn't survive into a second season although fans were cheated out of a resolution to the grand finale of season one.

 A stellar transfer for ""Earth 2"" is a highlight of the series. There's minimal dirt and debris to mar the marvelous picture seen here. The images are bright with vivid colors. There are occasional issues with edge enhancement and other digital artifacts but the presentation is quite pleasing. The 2.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound has nice presence and with the sound nicely placed around the speakers. Sadly, this is presented on two dual layered, dual sided discs and the holder won't protect them very well. I'd suggest picking up some DVD holders to prevent scratching and wear & tear.

 We don't get any featurettes or vintage interviews in the set which is a bit of a surprise. We do get deleted and extended scenes however and a blooper reel of outtakes from the series' first and only season. There's also a cross promotional effort going on with this set as it includes an episode of the cheesy and fun series ""Cleopatra 2525"" and an episode from ""Sliders: The Complete 3rd Season"" entitled ""Rules of the Game"". The episode of ""Cleopatra 2525"" ""Quest for Firepower"" is the pilot from the series created by Robert Tappert and R.J. Stewart (""Hercules"", ""Xena""). Although the series didn't last more than a season, it did revive the career of ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" star Gina Torres (as well as ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded"") who first got her start on the cult series ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" back in 1994. Image quality of the pilot episode of the series is very good although the effects appear a bit cheesy even by the standards of the year 2000.

""Rules of the Game"" is one of the best episodes from the third season of the Fox cult series ""Sliders"" which quickly declined in quality as writer/co-creator and co-producer Tracy Torme left the series after conflict with the Fox network and was replaced by writer/producer/director David Peckinpah who radically retooled the show killing off a major character (and eventually getting rid of a second major character) and generally recreating the series in his vision.

 Sadly, there's no commentary from any of the cast members or the producers/writers/directors. That's too bad as some extras might have helped this boxed set to sell a bit better. Many fans of the series have probably recorded it onto DVD or video from the airing it had on the Sci-Fi Channel and in its brief syndicated run.

 A very nicely done set from Universal, ""Earth 2"" looks and sounds exceptionally good on DVD. While extras are limited, the ones provided are nice although fans would probably have liked a few featurettes that focused on the creation of the show and what the producers were planning for the series during the unproduced second season.",1123113600,18,5135,4.824800910125142

While re-watching it I kept thinking about how this show tried to give us a story that was more reality driven. Today we have shows like Battlestar Galactica, Lost, and even the short lived Firefly that have all become highly regarded for using the same formula.

I believe that if this show had primered in 2004-2005 it would have been much better recieved, but sadly it was cancelled, and thanks to the fans dedication they have finally released these DVD's. Hopefully this is a sign that seaQuest DSV and Earth: Above and Beyond will soon be released in DVD boxed sets too!",1121990400,6,1056,4.355329949238579
2295234,5,B0009JE6G6,"Alright, I could go on and on about the show.  We all know how great it was. I was excited about the DVDs because I could replace my millions of Earth 2 VHS tapes under my bed with a much more manageable DVD collection!

Ok, I received my DVDs yesterday, and being a pretty a slightly obsessed fan, I was pretty upset by a few things. I'll have to check all the other reviews that have been posted, but why in the world did they decide to change the order of the episodes?  Yes, the show ended with a cliff-hanger, but changing the order of the episodes pretty much ruins the show.  If you really want to enjoy the show, save All About Eve for LAST.  Also, I don't understand the half-sleeve they include with the DVDs.  It was pretty ridiculous packaging, and I hope it doesn't become a trend.  Like how CDs come with those stupid ""dust jacket"" sleeves now.  The show itself will always be great to me, but I wish they had put a little effort into the DVD set.  Cleopatra 2525 and a Sliders episode as ""bonuses?""  Yuck.  But I know it was way too much to ask to get any kind of real bonus features on a show that's 10 years old and only lasted one series.  A show NBC despised from the start (7PM EST Sunday nights?  Constantly pre-empted by whatever sports event was going on at the time?  ARGH!)  But any kind of interviews or commentary track would've made me the happiest girl in the world.",1121990400,7,1395,4.250950570342205
2295235,2,B0009JE6G6,"I saw only the first episode on British SKYTV (I live in Germany), and had never seen the other episodes.  The first episode had promise.  However, as I have viewed the remaining episodes on DVD I find the series to have mundane writing, uninteresting characters and slow moving, uninteresting plots.  There are several points in the show where the characters talk, but make no sense (too numerous to list).  Don't feel like enough was revealed about the backstory.  Have no clue how long the days were.  Boring!!!!!",1121904000,3,516,4.873563218390805
2295236,4,B0009JE6G6,"I was never really interested in this show's overall plot (it didn't seem like the writers were either), but what I liked about it was the characters.  You had two groups of people:  The super-serious scientist types who were always making decisions for everyone, and the cool people who would more or less ignore thier decisions and do whatever they felt like.  This usually led to serious consequences, and that was the plot of most episodes.  I always liked the cool folks, even though they continually screwed everything up.  They were really human characters and really sympathetic.  They weren't cardboard cutouts of ""good"" people like Star Trek, and that was the best thing about the show.

I'm glad it's finally coming out on DVD.  I'll definitely pick it up.  I miss those folks!",1121472000,5,788,4.864661654135339
