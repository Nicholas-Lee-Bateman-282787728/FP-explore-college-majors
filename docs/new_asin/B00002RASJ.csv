1255919,4,B00002RASJ,"I saw this film at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Sean Axmaker calls it an adolescent wanna-be Tarantino (Isn't Tarantino adolescent enough?) but he's WRONG! Running Time uses its gimmick to tell an  effective, simple crime story without the ""clever"" pop refrences  that Tarantino hides his thievery behind. Although I'm not a member of the  Bruce-Cambell-Is-God club he gives a fine performance as the cocky  anti-hero. This isn't a great film but its a damn good one. Highly  Reccomended.",959040000,5,498,5.253164556962025
1255920,4,B00002RASJ,"PUT ASIDE ANY AND ALL NOTIONS THAT BECAUSE TWO PIVOTAL CHARACTERS (BRUCE CAMPBELL / JOSH BECKER) FROM EVIL DEAD / ARMY OF DARKNESS FAME ARE ONCE AGAIN CALABERATING ON A FILM PROJECT, THAT THE ""CAMPINESS"" AND  CHEESY DIALOG PREVAILS. IT DOESN'T, BUT WHAT YOU DO GET IS: SHEAR  BRILLIANCE IN FILM MAKING, I MEAN THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF MAKING A FILM, THE  CAMERA WORK IS MANNED BY ONE STEADYCAM OPERATER, WHOSE CUT AWAYS ARE SO  HIDDEN YOU GET A SENSE OF A ""DOCUMENTARY"" FEEL TO THE FILM. THE  ACTORS HAVING TO HIT THIER MARKS TO KEEP THE CAMERA IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  IS A REMARKABLE FEAT TO SEE. THE WRITING IS GREAT IF YOU YOU LIKE ""LOW  RENT CRIME"" (AND WHO DOESN'T) AND THE ACTING IS BELIEVABLE. THE FACT  THAT A COUPLE OF FRIENDS FROM MICHIGAN CAN ""SCREW-AROUND"" WITH  FILM WOULD EVENTUALLY END-UP WITH THIS QUALITY OF WORK (WITH NO CORPORATE  SUPPORT - EVER) IS WORTH DELVING DEEPER INTO THESE TWO ARTISTS WORK...

1255931,5,B00002RASJ,"There were some hilarious moments. The one-shot-like concept was great, but the ending was a little anti-climatic.

Bruce Campbell is great.",1196985600,,140,5.666666666666667
1255932,4,B00002RASJ,"This is a cool little film here.  It is a under 90 minute film that takes place in real time and achieves the effect of being all one continuous take, which is impressive.  To the sharp eye, I believe there are actually 2-3 cuts in the film that are well hidden and take nothing away from the enormity of the project undertaken on a small budget.  Bruce Campbell turns in a good performance, Anita Barone is hot, and the film moves along in an interesting way.  Fans of unique cinema and Bruce Campbell will have fun with this.",1176249600,,527,4.346938775510204
1255933,5,B00002RASJ,"""Running Time"" was Becker's take on Hitchcock's 1948 ""Rope.""  Becker's film is a technically more difficult shoot as it proceeds in real time and in a 360 degree on-set world, requiring the coordination and excessive efforts of actors, director, cameraman, sound crew, etc...I am amazed at how well it turned out.  From the cumbersome love scene to the display of ineptitude within the Laundromat, everything about the film was geared to put the viewer on edge.  With hidden cuts and genius camera work, the action was relentless and the viewer was never able to predict where the movie and/or characters were headed.  I highly recommend watching the film and then immediately listening to the commentary-you'd be amazed at how much went into making the story/editing seamless.

Briefly, the film begins with Carl's (Bruce Campbell) release from prison 5 years early for good behavior.  He is met by Patrick (Jeremy Roberts), a high school chum and raging idiot with whom he plans to steal the dirty warden's money.  As a gift, Patrick brings a local prostitute (and Carl's ex-girlfriend) along for the ride-Janie (played by Michigan chum, Anita Barone) quickly rekindles their old flame...so to speak.  After dropping Janie off, they pick up their new driver (the ever irresponsible junkie-genius) and their safe man, Carl's old cell mate.  The adventures in suspense, failure, frustration, and life lessons ensue.
DVD extras include hilarious commentary by writer/director/producer Josh Becker and  star, Bruce Campbell.  Score by Jo LoDuca (as usual).  ""Running Time"" is a wonderful addition to any Bruce Campbell or Josh Becker collection and for anyone who loves the continued efforts of independent filmmakers.",1075420800,3,1716,5.291512915129151
1255934,4,B00002RASJ,"You may remember the Hitchcock's movie, ""The Rope"" that was shot using one camera and uninterrupted real-time filming technique. Unlike the ""The Rope"" which was more of a stage play, ""Running Time"" actually runs. The main character played by Bruce Campbell, is released from prison, picked up by friend, has sex with a prostitute (later revealed to be his high school girlfriend), pulls off a heist, is shot, and runs from the law. Great chemistry between all the actors propels this unique film. Shot in black and white, this film is known in the Indie world as a classic. Written and directed by Josh Becker, one of the Detroit gang.

1255935,3,B00002RASJ,"Like Hitchcock's ROPE, running time is told in real time and was designed to look as though it were all created with a single, stunning shot.
Also like ROPE, it gets tangled up in its own device.
I can understand why someone would want to make (or act in) a film like this--the technical and performance challenges require one to be at his sharpest during principle photography.  At the other end, well, there's almost no editing to do:  you shoot the thing, pick the reels that work best together, and get to work on the soundtrack.
Between my curiosity about the technique and my fondness for star Bruce Campbell, I picked this one up at a local used DVD shop.
The plot's pretty standard crime fare--the most interesting twist is that Campbell's character, who starts the film in prison, is back on a job before the ink on his parole papers has dried (it's real time, remember).  But the technique is the real star of this show--it's a guarantee that the unblinking camera, wandering and watching, will draw your attention away from the story.  In my world, though, camerawork is supposed to support the story, not distract you from it.
The performances are good all around and suitable to the format (no exceptional gaffes or line flubs), but in the end, I think the average viewer will simply write this off as an interesting way to burn an hour and fifteen minutes.",1017619200,,1370,4.648760330578512
1255936,5,B00002RASJ,"This movie is totally different, and very fast paced. I think it is genious how they made this movie appear as 1 take. I looked for this title for many months, and I was not dissapointed in it.",1001376000,,193,4.105263157894737
1255937,4,B00002RASJ,"A must have for any Bruce Campbell fan!!!  The film is not the greatest film ever made, but it is the typical Campbell one liners and side kick comedy.  This film does have a little of everything action, comedy and a little romance.  Check it out!",999561600,,247,4.326086956521739
1255938,4,B00002RASJ,"You could definitely do worse with 70 minutes than watch this fun Bruce Campbell film. While all the cuts are not nearly as seamless as you may have been led to believe, you don't notice the majority of them. The pace is consistent and well-suited to the plot, and the acting is generally pretty good. If you're a fan of Bruce Campbell, this is definitely a must-see. If you're not, it's still worth a look.",993686400,6,407,4.44

1255940,5,B00002RASJ,"Josh Becker's Running Time is certainly one of the best film's I've seen in a long time.  It's a crime caper with a gimmick-this film is seemingly shot in one continuous shot.  While this makes for an interesting watch, Running Time has a lot more going for it than just that gimick.
Bruce Campbell turns in one of his strongest performances to date here as Carl, a convict just released from prison with one last heist to pull off.  He and his partner in crime (Jeremy Roberts) assemble a crew to assist in the heist and before you know it the robbery it botched and Carl is running for his life.
Running Time's story written by Josh Becker (who also produced and directed) boasts nothing terribly original in terms of the actual plot, but his dialogue is sharp and brings all of his characters to life.  Campbell really displays range in this film creating a wholly believable character who is struggling to make things right in his own life.  It would be great to see this fine actor cast in more dynamic roles such as this one.
Although Running Time clocks in with a running time of 70 minutes, there's enough talent, humor and suspense in here for ten Hollywood productions.  Josh Becker has always made great and interesting films, I anxiously look forward to his next project, Running Time was one of the best films I saw that year and it never gets old.  Give this film a shot, it's as good a crime film as any made in the 90's and one that demands a larger audience.",984096000,11,1475,4.4609665427509295

7916118,5,B00002RASJ,"I thought I had seen all of Bruce Campbell's films till I saw the title ""Running Time"" on his IMDB filmography. I tried to find it on Netflix or other streaming services but it was no where to be found so I had to buy this Turkish import. Turns out it was a great buy. This is easily one of Bruce Campbell's greatest performance. He pulls off a classic American tough guy con/loser in love that virtually any American Actor would be envious of.

The movie's got some real technical challenges and one great gimmick. The entire film takes place in real time, it's supposed to look like one long take. It works fine and is a million miles from the extremely overrated Rope from Hitchcock. Hitchcock looked at the challenge and basically filmed a play. Running Time takes the challenge to it's ultimate extreme. The single ""take"" runs through a million locations from the prison Campbell is released from to the job he's on before the ink on his release papers is dry. The movie's got it's share of flaws, from old lovers not recognizing each other at the plots convenience to two ""pro"" thieves fighting tooth and nail in front of witnesses in the middle of a robbery. These flaws don't diminish the viewers enjoyment in any way. This movie is a triumph and I'm amazed it hasn't got a more prominent reputation.

Bruce Campbell fans will love this because it's him, at the absolute apex of his powers in a different kind of role. He's the same wisecracking, tough guy and frankly I think Steve McQueen would have been hard pressed to personify ""American Cool"" the way Bruce does in this role. As always Campbell's the smartest guy in the room but this character is a little more coarse and much more of a loser than Campbell usually plays. I've been telling my friends about this movie since I bought it, I think it not only stands as a great American crime classic, it stands head and shoulders over many perceived classics.",1374192000,,1922,4.568115942028985
7916119,5,B00002RASJ,"Bruce Campbell starred in it, which is what made me interested in seeing this movie, but the story and the interaction among the characters, feeling like a participant and the nail-biting tension as everything fell apart little by little, along with Bruce's performance, were what made this a terrific movie.  I loved the effect of making it look like one take and the cameras following the characters, which drew me in and gave the illusion of a documentary of a robbery gone bad, except no one was talking to the camera.  At times it was uncomfortable, and wishing that I didn't have to be a fly on the wall watching this brilliant plan get shredded only added to the tension that made this film such a treat to watch.  And in the end, despite what he'd done, I was rooting for Carl to get away and succeed at the new life he wanted to grab with Janie.",1358035200,,854,4.426751592356688
7916120,4,B00002RASJ,"A movie centred around a gimmick, brought to you by the man who gave us Alien Apocalypse (yes, the movie with the inexplicably bad fake beards) and starring Bruce 'groovy' Campbell, this could have been one of those movies you regret watching. However, it turned out to be rather enjoyable. Perhaps a little cliche heavy and you do have to wonder at the probablility of a prostitute of ten years breaking into tears at being let down, but by far the positives outweight the negatives. Well planned, the technical execution was impressive and well acted by all involved, I found myself completely hooked as events spiral out of control. Absolutely enjoyable - I would definitely recommend watching it if you get a chance!",1271548800,,720,4.861788617886178
