8601089,2,B00E4V0G82,"My biggest issue with the movie itself was the poor design of the subtitles. The dialog is in German, and there are English subtitles at bottom. The problem is, when the English subtitles are flashed-up, they then quickly disappear!  I'm not a slow reader, and quite used to foreign films which I enjoy, but I can honestly tell you its poor technology that they didn't think this thru right.. So, you can either quickly try and read the English translation when it pops up, or you can just follow the the screen action, but many times you can't do both and you you don't know who is talking!! Don't recommend unless you are a native speaker......",1491264000,2,646,4.568965517241379

8601092,3,B00E4V0G82,A disturbing and violent folktale with a hint of mysticism mixed in! I can't say I'd recommend more than one watch but this is a well made film with a dark and intriguing premise that plays on the idea of what's fact and what's fiction.,1407369600,2,236,4.266666666666667
8601093,5,B00E4V0G82,"this mystery has it all,thrills,chills,and murder.the setting in a remote mountain village is creepy.the year is 1975,this is before the internet.the village is isolated,so folklore abound in their lives.throw together a lieing priest,drunk lonely sheepherders and out of the loop town cop.the movie moves all around at fast pace,dances between illusion and reality with tons of secrets.keeps you guessing until the end.too bad its a region 2 dvd,but your pc lets you play this great movie.the actors are good at acting in their roles.",1341360000,5,535,5.380952380952381
