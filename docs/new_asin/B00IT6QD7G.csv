6292540,4,B00IT6QD7G,"While I can never imagine living in a ""tiny house"" I appreciate the spare and economical living style of those who choose to do so. This short documentary covers the story of Christopher Smith, who at nearly 30 years old, has little sense of place or home since he has moved so frequently during his youth in a military family. He buys a trailer bed and starts to build his tiny house in the backyard of someone in Colorado, and much of the documentary focuses on the process of building the house. Interspersed with his building process, we visit other tiny houses and meet their owners. Some people choose tiny house living out of economic necessity, but others choose this life style to simplify and hone their possessions to a bare minimum.

The documentary drags on at times with long scenes of Christopher's building process, whereas I would have preferred to see more variations of tiny houses and their owners. I think this documentary has the bones of a longer piece that could focus on the tiny house movement. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, where real estate is ridiculously expensive, we hear from time to time of people who are living in small homes. This is a perfect environment for people who want to live small but still enjoy everything the urban environment offers.",1405036800,5,1289,4.70353982300885
6292541,5,B00IT6QD7G,I came across this film while searching on Netflix. Tiny housing has always fascinated me. We admired this couple's perseverance and optimism. Christopher never gave up. We have a son his age and Christopher and Merete's families should be so proud of them. We thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.,1404259200,7,297,5.208333333333333
6292542,2,B00IT6QD7G,"Nine Things about the Movie Tiny [USA, 2014]

1. Capitalizing on the maker movement and the downsizing movement, this is supposed to be a small documentary (its barely an hour long) on the recent popularity of building tiny houses, which are houses under 400 square feet. But its not really a documentary. Its a home-brewed screed against consumerism. Not that theres anything wrong with that, but I was hoping for a more balanced and informative piece of filmmaking.

2. The movie follows a guy named Chris as he buys a piece of land in the middle of nowhere in Colorado, and builds a tiny house on a trailer. Chris is assisted by his angst-ridden girlfriend, who stresses on what is the meaning of home, probably because she wants to move to New York City while her boyfriend is getting ready to leave the entire civilized world behind.

3. Even though the movie is only lasts an hour, its about 30 minutes too long. It makes all of its points very quickly, and then repeats them over and over. This is why, in between watching scenes of Chris building his house like an HGTV special, we see lots of pictures of other tiny houses. Lots of pictures. Lots of them.

4. The movie also interviews other tiny housers while they wax romantic about their life perspectives. They are earnest and friendly, but they come off sounding a little smug and pretentious. They give us nuggets of wisdom like:
The world gets a lot bigger when you're living small.
The whole world is now my living room.
I wanted to be larger than the small person that I needed to be in my big house.

5. Very little discussion is given to the problems of tiny houses, such as storage, occupancy, and privacy. And only once does the movie acknowledge the elephant in the room: Chris admits that theres a weird irony in what hes doing. He loves open spaces, so he bought some and built a house on it. But if everyone did that, there would be no more open spaces left.

6. I think its funny that one of the gurus of tiny housing lived for a decade in buildings of less than 100 square feet, but then broke down and bought a 500 square foot house to live in with his family. He has another tiny house in his backyard.

7. One thing the movie never really touches on is the psychological makeup of these tiny housers. A lot of them are the crunchy granola types. But Chris literally wants to live on a 10 x 12 foot slab of wood hundreds of miles from other people. Hes determined to do it whether his girlfriend stays with him or not. Thats really interesting, but its never explored. Probably because its his girlfriend doing most of the filming.

8. The movie tries to make you feel bad if you don't want to be like these people, or if you are not in a position where you can do it (like if you have kids). And in case you don't learn the lesson that tiny houses are a wonderful, natural state of being, the film ends with an aerial shot of Chriss house surrounded by grass, trees, and a rainbow.

9. This movie is mildly interesting, but a lot of it is nothing more than personal home movie footage, and doesnt really explore the topic like I was hoping. Perhaps most critically, the movie backfired on me. While I was neutral on the topic before I saw this, now I find that the fad of tiny housing is kind of silly, creepy, and hypocritical.",1403568000,23,3309,4.3849918433931485
6292543,3,B00IT6QD7G,"My knowledge of the Tiny House concept is that it should not take almost a year to build the house, which it did take the main character of this documentary.  He seemed slow, undecided and basically uncommitted.  All of which he kinda-sorta acknowledges, or his friends and family do.  But it made for a less-than-enjoyable DVD, as you basically wanted him to get on with it and get the darn house finished, or find someone who knew what they were doing to help him finish it, so you could see how the house lived, and what the experience of living in it was like, which got relegated to the final after-shot minutes of the DVD, after he FINALLY got it done.  So if you want to watch an excruciatingly slow building process-meets-psychological anguish of completing a tiny house, this is the one for you.  If you want to actually ""see"" how someone lives in a tiny house (which is what I wanted), then this is not your best choice.  I'm fascinated with the concept, have read several books and articles on the subject (so far they lost me at the idea of a composting toilet), and wanted a glimpse of what life was like living in a tiny house, not ""how long can it take to build a tiny house?""  Other than the general subject matter not being what I wanted, the documentary itself was well done.",1402358400,17,1293,4.430379746835443
6292544,4,B00IT6QD7G,"This relatively short (62 minutes) documentary about the tiny houses movement (where people give up many of their possessions) and build their own houses of less than 500 square feet (even as small as under 500 square feet of footprint) has been playing film festivals around the country. When 30 year-old Christopher Smith decided to downsize his life and build a 300 square foot house on a five-acre plot of land he bought in Colorado, he and his girlfriend Merete Mueller decided to turn the year-long project into a film. Smith had some film experience and Mueller was a writer.  Tiny is the result. The two narrated the film and interviewed each other as well as paying visits to other Tiny houses. (Note that in most cases the sleeping areas were lofts reached by a ladder.). They also used a Kickstarter campaign to fund their project.  Its an interesting concept  one that I was not aware of and Im glad I watched this film. The scenery of the Colorado mountain site where Smith was building the house (on the back of a trailer, I might add) is gorgeous and the image on the DVD is beautiful.
The bonus material more than doubles the running time of the film. There is a making of featurette and deleted scenes both of Smith and Mueller and some of the others who have built tiny houses. And then there is a nearly-30-minute segment with an interview at a film festival. Honestly, while I really enjoyed the film, I did get bored with some of the repetition in the bonus footage. But anyone interested in this concept will find it worthwhile. In fact the co-friendly cardboard case which holds the DVD has printed info on how to learn more about designing small spaces and downsizing.

This is a film that will fly under the radar and Im glad that the folks at First Run Features (who provided the screener) are giving it wider distribution.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8645242,3,B00IT6QD7G,"Forsaking the forced drama of home reality shows (where redoing the floor might reveal hardwood or lead pipes!) this documentary simply follows a tiny homes construction from start to finish. The main drama here is that it takes a little longer than expected to complete. There are no stakes involved, no tension, and nothing about actually living in the house. If nothing else, the film gives us an opportunity to think about the idea of the tiny house, a term that expresses a kind of idolatry, as tiny house guru Jay Shafer says toward the end of the documentary. It is as if the term, along with the fact that a structure looks like a house and is built with ones own hands, makes it metaphysically different from a camper or a trailer home. We might watch a documentary about someone building a small house but who wants to see a film about a homemade camper? The meaning of tiny house, both the term and the film, is that these small houses are critiques of a suburban, bigger-is-better status quo. This lifestyle choice assumes an ability to extract oneself from culture-at-large, and as such, reflects one of the following: a search for meaning; a symbolic act; a concern for sustainability; or a longing for a counter-cultural position that no longer exists.",1518307200,,1267,4.737556561085973
8645243,3,B00IT6QD7G,"WARNING - SPOILER ALERT!

First, let me say that I am a big proponent of the tiny house movement, and was really looking forward to this film.  Many people feel threatened by the tiny house movement, and the criticisms I have for this film have nothing to do with the premise, and what it is like to build a tiny house, it has to do with the way the movie was made.

THE GOOD -
Loved the interviews with other tiny housers, particularly the tours of their homes.  The interviews with Jay Schafer, Dee Williams and the others who are actually living the lifestyle, make this movie worth watching, and rather than long boring segments of driving screws and dropping tools, I would have preferred more of the interviews and explanations on how they make their tiny lifestyle work.  In addition, the music and landscape cinematography is fantastic, and it makes the movie much more enjoyable than it would otherwise be.

THE BAD -
While Merete and Christopher are fairly likable, several things really turned me off, namely, I couldn't help wonder if this was a movie about living tiny?  Or, was living tiny a ploy to make a movie?

1.  The price of the movie changed several times.  When I first went to buy it, it listed for $24.95 on their website, (has now been reduced to $20) and of course, it is cheaper here on Amazon.  Feels like they are taking advantage of people interested in tiny houses, particularly given the run time of the film is approximately an hour.  That's pretty pricey for a one hour movie.  On their website, there is the option to buy it on Vimeo OnDemand for $5.99, but that price is not available in the US.  It just feels that the pricing is a bit opportunistic.

2.  There are unfortunately, people out there who have jumped on the tiny bandwagon for the opportunity to make a buck.  When I first started investigating the tiny lifestyle, I was shocked to learn that there are several people advocating living tiny, selling plans, DVD's, ""how-to's"", etc....who aren't even living in a tiny house.  This is what really disappointed me here as well.  According to their blog, Merete is in New York, and Christopher moved to LA to pursue a film career.  Christopher moved the tiny house fairly quickly from outside of Hartsell to the yard of a friend in Boulder, because Hartsell was too remote.  Ummmm...considering he bought the land a year in advance, you would think it was pretty evident the area was remote.  The bottom line is that according to the blog, he lived there a total of 7-8 months.  That was really disappointing, and feels like the story was made to launch a film career, not to explore a lifestyle.  It once again feels opportunistic, and I would much rather see a tiny house documentary by someone actually living in a tiny house.  Disappointing, but it's a fairly decent movie, and if you are into this sort of thing, the interviews are enough to keep your interest.",1433980800,6,2912,4.607766990291262
8645244,4,B00IT6QD7G,"What an excellent movie! I saw it at a local theatre and had to get the DVD to show family and friends and share with others. Truly inspiring for anything who likes design, architecture, sustainable living, or DIY home building! Heart-warming and happy with great people and stories!",1428537600,,283,4.916666666666667
8645245,2,B00IT6QD7G,"I'm a fan of tiny houses, even planning for my own build in a few months, but this movie does not live up to the hype it's given in the Tiny House Communities.  I much prefer Merette's youtube videos to this one.  Her boyfriend is not a very engaging subject matter, and truth is, there were far more interesting people in the short clips that I would have much preferred watching more of than seeing him bumble his way around what he intended to be a 3 month build.  I watched on Hulu rather than paying for it, but would really recommend just looking up more youtube videos and watching them instead, though maybe it has value if you watch it on fast forward and pause it to see the different builds that are briefly shown.  (no, they're not showcased, they're just there in the background.)  Definitely fast forward through the family meal, you won't learn much of anything in this movie, sound off would make it more enjoyable.",1425513600,,931,4.485207100591716
8645246,4,B00IT6QD7G,"A lovely little documentary with a DIY feel about a DIY ethos around tiny homes. Quirky, but thoughtful and informative. Some good material on the tiny home movement.",1424908800,2,166,4.964285714285714
8645247,2,B00IT6QD7G,"My wife and I have been discussing the concept of a tiny house as a cabin for a couple years.  I like the idea of living conservatively, at least some of the time.  When we saw this on Netflix, it seemed like it could be a great film, so we added it to the queue and finally got to it tonight.

I will first echo the other reviewers thoughts that there is no real conflict here.  He wants a tiny house in the woods, she seems too undecided to oppose, so they do that.  End of story.  It really felt cut off early, it's awesome that they had the house, but how?  Did they both quit their jobs?  He had a computer, but no hard wired power, so presumably no wifi.  How are they supporting themselves?  It also feels a bit elitist, the other tiny house proponents offer up some good insights, but usually with an arrogant twist.  Yes, you live cheaper than I do by choice.  I appreciate your perspective but don't need your judgement.

What I feel was missing is a real analysis of the idea of a tiny house.  There are many conflicts with the concept, specifically with larger families and, at least in my case, hobbies that require a lot of room.  I would be plenty happy with a 200 square foot tiny house provided I had a 500 square foot garage attached to it that I could keep my project vehicles in.  I understand I'm an outlier, so how about more perspective on tiny house living with kids?  There's one mention of it towards the end, but I feel it could have used a bit more time.  I attribute this lacking perspective to the age and life stage of the movies creators, but I still feel that it could have been explored in more depth.  Honestly even a bit more detail on some of the unique tricks used to maximize space and storage would have been beneficial.

The upside is this movie clocks in at just over an hour, so I don't feel like my time was really wasted.  I could do for more but the information given in the time was at least a good intro.  If you know nothing about tiny houses, give it a shot, maybe you'll find something you like.  If you've done some research in the past, perhaps look at other sources of information as you likely won't get a lot out of this one.",1422576000,2,2181,4.202409638554217
8645248,4,B00IT6QD7G,"This fascinating documentary shows a diversity of people, who chose a smaller lifestyle in exchange for peace of mind.  Some of the reasons people chose smaller homes include: returning to a more simplistic life with less things to burden them; low cost living; being mortgage free; the ability to move their home to wherever they desired (some were on wheels); and affordability to name a few (less expensive than renting or buying other home options).

The documentary focuses primarily on one man, who designs his own home and sets about to build the entire tiny house with electric and usable toilet all on his own with only his girlfriend to assist when two hands are needed.  It was intriguing to watch him conquer unforeseen problems and the sense of ownership and self-sufficiency he gains as he tackles these challenges.

Others persons interviewed talk about how they had been able to refocus their lives and prioritize that which is important to them because their homes were not taking the funds or the time in maintenance that prior living space had.  This included two couples, who shared how the smaller living space had brought them closer emotionally not just literally.

One major drawback in my opinion is that the human waste is something that must be regularly eliminated as the toilets are self-contained.

While some might think this is just an ""alternative"" lifestyle, there are companies that are manufacturing the entire homes which can be bought as a package or even assembled.  Unfortunately, the documentary didn't explore this concept which I think was a loss for viewers.

I enjoyed the diversity of settings that were visited.  Some people lived on large plots of land, while others lived behind someone's home, still others lived on city streets including one fellow in New York City.

Of course, we don't know what was edited out of the documentary as nearly everyone was quite happy with their choices even the couples.  I can imagine that some people might realize that living tiny isn't for them but we don't have any examples of those who left that choice behind perhaps this is a small percentage of folks and locating them wasn't easily accomplished.

I would recommend this documentary for anyone who wants to escape the mortgage nightmare or apartment living.  This is definitely the ""poor"" man's an alternative to trailers or RV's.",1417737600,,2374,4.977215189873418
