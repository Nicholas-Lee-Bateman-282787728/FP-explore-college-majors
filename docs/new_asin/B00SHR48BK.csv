8698393,5,B00SHR48BK,Can't say enough about this clever well written series.  I have seen plenty of crime scene  investigation  dramas but who could have imagined a series where the main character  is the owner of a crime clean up company  who gets involved with a drug lord.  Plenty of twists and turns and not a dull moment.  The cast is outstanding.  Great viewing.,1477008000,2,347,4.573770491803279

8698395,5,B00SHR48BK,"I love this series!  the DVD set is terrific and I'm particularly thrilled that it has a French version in addition to the English version since I am an intermediate French speaker (great for practice).  The storyline is engrossing, fast paced and full of surprises.  Great acting and a great cast.  I read that the series has been renewed for a second season and I will definitely buy the next season when it comes out on DVD!",1456617600,2,427,4.5064935064935066
