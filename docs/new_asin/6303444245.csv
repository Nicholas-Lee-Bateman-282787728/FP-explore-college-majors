7846973,4,6303444245,A favorite of my kids when they were young so I was happy to find this for sale. The price was a bit high but since I couldn't find it anywhere else online I bought it. The video quality is poor and it looks like a copy of a VHS version but it does have chapters like a DVD. Overall poor quality but a limited availability forced my hand on this purchase.,1396396800,,355,3.9444444444444446
7846974,5,6303444245,"7 Ninja Kids, wow, this is one the best movies ever made. I never thought there would be a decent fanbase for this movie!",1267574400,,121,4.083333333333333

7846976,5,6303444245,"I have six kids.  The youngest is now almost 17, the oldest almost 29...  When the oldest was about 12 or 13, I brought home a VHS videotape, then entitled ""7 Ninja Kids"".  My kids loved it.  They watched it over and over and over again.  I remember once the tape got stuck in the machine and I had to get it out and take apart the cartridge and repair  it, and my kids were sitting there, real worried, and when I finally got it going again, they were visibly relieved.  They knew every line of dialog. They could actually sing along with the opening and closing theme songs...in Chinese!

  Now I have grandchildren.  The oldest is 7.  I was talking to him about 2 weeks ago and he was telling me how he wants to be a ninja when he grows up...  He likes to watch DVD kung fu movies.  His favorites are ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"", (""it's about the axe gang, papa..."").(Yeah, I knew that...I'd seen it, too....and it's one of MY favorites, too.)  He also likes ""Drag out the Couch and Hide the Tiger""...  Loves Jet Li and Jackie Chan and Choy Li Fat.  Had never seen Bruce Lee!  So I told him I'd try to get ""Enter the Dragon"" for him.  (""You've GOTTA see THAT, dude...""). Then I remembered ""7 Ninja Kids""...

  I found it on Amazon, now entitled ""7 Lucky Ninja Kids"", and ordered it....cheap, too.  Yesterday, He came over and asked me if I had gotten any more of those 25-cent movies like he watched last time he was here (Jackie Chan in ""Spiritual Kung Fu"", about a young J.C. learning 5 Animal style from 5 ghosts at night, in a Shaolin monastery.)  I said, ""No, but I did get this one, that your Mom and all the others, used to watch when they were kids..."", and put in ""7 Lucky Ninja Kids"".  My daughter (his Mom) was at the other end of the house, and when she heard it come on, she started singing along in Chinese, and hustled into the room in time to deliver the first line of dialog before the kid in the movie said it.  This is after about 14 or 15 years has passed since she last saw it...  About a half hour later, I go in there, and Grandma, Grandson, his Mom, and his 2 Uncles (my youngest sons, ages 17 and 19) are all watching the 7 ninja kids (LUCKY ninja kids...) going at it....the 7 lucky ninja kids are actually yelling out ""hiiigh-YAH!"".  Comments are being made by MY kids, like ""now, watch Rocky here..."".

  Yes, my grandson LOVED it.  When I asked him if he wanted to take it home, he said ""No, I don't want yours to get messed up, Papa....I'm gonna have my Dad order one, so we can always have it at our house, and I can watch it when I come over here, too.""  (He's a very conscientious little dude...)  So, if you have kids, or grand kids, (up to about age 14 or 15, but especially younger, like about between 4 and 10), do everyone a favor and order up this classic (or, order 2....like I said, they're cheap).  I bet they'll like it.  And then, about twenty-five years from now, they'll be saying to their kids, ""You're gonna like this, I think.  My grandfather got this for your grandmother when she was a kid, and they all used to watch it a lot, and then he turned me on to it when I was about 7..."".  So that can be part of YOUR own personal legend, too.  And, all this considered, I don't think I'm out of line giving this grainy, over-dubbed digitalized old favorite the full 5 stars...do you?

  P.S.: This copy of the DVD also includes: a full-length ""Little Rascals"" cartoon, ""Spooky Hooky""; an interactive ""movie quiz"" (that has nothing to do with the ""7LNK"" movie...); a dictionary of DVD terms and technology that can be downloaded, and printed (...over 50 topics discussed in detail!); and access to a ""free DVDs"" Rewards Program for frequent purchasers....not too shabby.",1149033600,16,3737,4.310344827586207
7846977,5,6303444245,"Some friends of mine discovered 7LNK on accident, since then we have been completely obsessed! It was intended to be a comedy but its funny well beyond the writers' Bob Saget sense of humor.  Don't let the cover fool you, there's no pizza eating and its far from G rated as theres cussing and people getting shot face.  There's so much to say about the movie!  The soundtrack is a total curiosity. The main theme is a ripoff of ""Like A Virgin,"" throughout the movie theres a reoccuring Journey-sounding song and the theme from Halloween?  The over-dubbed dialogue is corny as hell and they're not afraid to add the randomest of babble when the characters mouths move for too long.  Props to the special effects crew for their employment of such life-like sock monkeys as stunt doubles.  The plot is quite complex too.. anyone who can figure out why the hell the henchman was discussing Regan's foreign policy deserves a place with Einstein.  You don't even have to be high to be mesmerized by this masterpiece, but you'll think you are....",1086134400,9,1039,4.707182320441989
7846978,5,6303444245,"When my mother shelled out [$$) to rent this movie for my brother and me years ago, I expected just another ninja kiddie movie, in the vein of 3 Ninjas or 3 Ninjas Kick Back -- or maybe even (dare I say it?) 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up. Boy was I ever surprised . . . pleasantly surprised!
I was captivated from the moment those 7 lucky ninja kids came on the screen until the ending credits finished scrolling by. Even now I hear the cheerful song of the ninja kids: ""Jeeba Jabbu, Jabbu Jee. Jeeba Jabbu Jee...."" I had no idea what that song meant when I heard it, but now I know that it transcends language and cultural barriers as one of the musical masterpieces of our time.
Great story, great characters, great music . . . what more can I say? Nothing. I cannot fully describe this movie with colorful language alone. Only by seeing this movie will you be able to appreciate it. Watching this movie was easily the greatest experience of my young life.",1025740800,2,948,4.331460674157303
7846979,4,6303444245,"Although this movie is no Pokemon, it does have some great merit. If I could skip school or anything else just to watch this movie, I surely would.  Good, God, how I loved this movie.  You will love it too.",954892800,3,206,4.125
7846980,5,6303444245,"Rarely does a movie come along with such pinache and dignity. Truly, this is a film for the ages. Better than the bible, 7 lucky ninja kids died for your sins.",945129600,3,159,4.161290322580645
