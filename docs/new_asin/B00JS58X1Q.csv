8653698,5,B00JS58X1Q,I liked that the content is presented in a very appropriate way for children to learn a language- a good balance of new material and repetition and practice of the latter.  I've found that this program is a good compliment to formal group classes. It allows students to see how target vocabulary is used in a new context and thus helps them remember it faster. The DVD also offers nice functional phrases that helps students develop communicational skills and not just knowledge of individual words.,1420243200,,499,4.870588235294117

8653700,5,B00JS58X1Q,"What a wonderful educational program! And very much needed. I have been looking for an alternative to Russian textbook for my bi-lingual kids (the books can get pretty daunting :) This program kept them glued to the TV. They didn't even notice they were learning while watching and having fun. I would say it's ideal for kids 6 and younger. Although depending on a starting language level, older kids might find it helpful too). I noticed that my 8 y.o. picked up a few new words too. I think the program offered a good combination of words and short sentences for day-to-day use(like ""what is this?"", ""let's go"",
""me too"" as well some more challenging words - ""waterfall"", ""butterfly"", etc.) Both characters and the kids in the video are super cute :) I really hope Mishka and Frog will continue their adventure and we will see many more videos in the future. I'm also interested in the Spanish version of this.",1414713600,,912,4.670807453416149
8653701,5,B00JS58X1Q,"My grandchildren (age 5 and 6) are learning Russian and Spanish in addition to English (their first language) and they love watching Little Sponges DVDs!  They remembered and were able to say many words even after watching it only one time.  We watch the movie at home and in the car and the more they see it the more they learn.  There are many useful words and phrases in the movie that the kids can use in everyday life. One puppet speaks English and the other puppet speaks (Russian or Spanish depending on which DVD you get) so the kids know the meaning of each word (vs. other DVDs that only give you the word in foreign language without any translation).  I've enjoyed watching these movies myself as they have beautiful
videos and music and I learned many new words.  Very effective for kids and adults!  My friend who leaves in Russia just bought Russian/English version for her daughter to help her learn English.",1414627200,,923,4.597560975609756
8653702,5,B00JS58X1Q,"This is a great DVD with adorable puppets, engaging stories and unique teaching method where same short phrases are spoken in both Russian and English, and captions are shown side-by-side. As a native Russian speaker raising kids in America, I look for any materials to build their Russian vocabulary and develop their reading skills in a playful, fun way. They watched the entire DVD and asked for more! We look forward to the new episodes!",1413417600,2,441,4.8933333333333335
8653703,5,B00JS58X1Q,"Not only did my children learn a couple of words, so did I.  This is a great learning technique...a true simultaneous learning experience.  Good repetition, great characters and a really nice story line.",1397952000,,203,5.121212121212121
