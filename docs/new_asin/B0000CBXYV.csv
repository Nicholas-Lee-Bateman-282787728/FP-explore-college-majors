1918454,5,B0000CBXYV,Great video.  The complete video is now actually available on DVD special order from the Jesus Film Project office.  This is one of the best videos on the market.  This DVD is just short edits of complete video.,1432771200,,211,4.5

1918457,3,B0000CBXYV,"It seems the DVD.s  when bought individually  such as all I have bought  are awesome and rate  5 stars, Truly done are  the DVD's I have mentioned . Great people of the bible is okay, but I was disappointed in  it.  C.M",1369267200,,219,4.071428571428571
1918458,2,B0000CBXYV,"When I saw this on television, I thought it was very good and I loved Topol's protrayal of Abraham.  However, when I received this copy, the quality of the film was so poor and the narrator's voice drowned out the Hebrew.  Had the picture been clearer and not badly faded, I would have given it a higher rating.  No, I would not recommend this to a friend.",1357171200,,356,4.2835820895522385
1918459,1,B0000CBXYV,"This is not at all what I thought I was getting. I own the New Media Bible original VHS version. It is 1000 times better. Flawless choreography between the scripture verses and Hebrew and Aramaic background and the actors. That is what John Heyman intended.  This is more than a rip off but a artistic embarrassment.

Reader's digest would do themselves and their viewers a favor by releasing the original version with Alexander Scourby (you cannot do better for a narrator!!!).

Please release the original. I had waited years for this version and my wife purchased it for me. If you will not, please at least acknowledge this is not the original.",1346544000,3,648,4.767857142857143
1918460,1,B0000CBXYV,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the production.  If this is supposed to be a documentary -- mostly told through voice over and the actors are not speaking English -- then it needs some citation for it's information.  If it is supposed to be a drama -- the Bible scenes are acted out and there is scenery and costumes -- then it needs better actors.  This group of actors was worse than watching a third grade performance.

The biggest problem though is that no where on the DVD box or the videos themselves is it explained why these Biblical stories are being told this way. It was a waste of my money because there are much better documentaries out there and certainly much better dramas of the exact same stories.",1298764800,,725,4.46969696969697
1918461,5,B0000CBXYV,"I enjoyed this dvd so much that I'd like to know if there are any other  books of the Bible directed in the same manner??? In my opinion, these stories were presented very well! I particularly liked the way the bible scriptures (verses), were directly woven into the storylines. Very nicely done!",1213315200,7,296,4.6923076923076925
1918462,5,B0000CBXYV,"This is by far the best video depiction of the Book of Genesis.

I don't know where the other reviewer gets his information about Moses being in this video.  As I remember it, this video covers the Book of Genesis, not Exodus.

Sticks faithfully to the biblical text, which is why this one is so hard to find.  (The establishment is no friend of the Bible.)

Topol's portrayal of Abraham can't be beat!",1206748800,10,402,4.4520547945205475
1918463,4,B0000CBXYV,"When I first seen this video I was expecting more of the same old 1960's style bible movies.  I was wrong.  This seemed to be more accurate than past videos.  I enjoyed it very much! The only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is there were a couple spots that were a little off and a couple ommisions.  I was very tempted to give it 5 stars.  Moses in real life had a speach impediment and Arron done all the talking for him, this movie (like past movies) still had Moses doing most of the talking.  Little things like that effected my rating.  But those types of things were few and far between and easily spotted.  The important areas seemed to be accurate and very entertaining of course.  I highly recommend it!",974505600,20,724,4.264705882352941

7998890,1,B0000CBXYV,"I loved this series when I was growing up, so I was sadly disappointed by this version.  The original narration quoted the actual scriptures whereas this new narration is mostly commentary.  I'm truly sad at the change.  When did the actual words from the scriptures become inadequate?  It feels like this amazing series was ruined.  I won't be keeping this DVD.",1479340800,3,362,4.868852459016393
7998891,1,B0000CBXYV,Not satisfying. Lower than what I expected it. The film is exactly similar to the one anybody can watch at YouTube for free.,1472860800,,124,4.434782608695652
7998892,3,B0000CBXYV,I wasn't particularly fond of this tape - a lot of the content was narrated. I expected more movie than narration.,1456790400,,114,4.476190476190476

7998894,4,B0000CBXYV,"A Classical Collection of highlights from the Reader's Digest, color, 6-disc, DVD, big-screen portrayal of: GREAT PEOPLE OF THE BIBLE. Which amounts too, over 12-hours of entertaining viewing and educational time. Whether at home, school or church, this DVD Set highlighting certain principle figures from within both the Old and New Testaments of the Holy Bible, is genuinely very interesting. In other words, you don't have to be a Christian or some Bible scholar, in order to appreciate the illustrated contents. Abraham, his wife Sarah, their Covenant Son - Isaac, and his twin sons: Esau and Jacob and Jacobs' beloved son - Joseph, are all touched upon within the first DVD. The following DVD's, include and some feature:  The Apostle Paul and Mary of Nazareth, followed by: Jesus' - Birth and Ministry, His Final Day's and His Glorious Resurrection. As a bonus, also included, is a rare depiction of the: Gift of Jabez. The seemingly insignificant prayer of a social ""nobody"", but of ""someone significant"" in the eyes of God, whose prayer... the Lord not only heard, but answered and granted, as well. For the Holy Bible, states: ""And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: And his mother called his name Jabez, saying: 'Because I bore him with sorrow.' And Jabez, called on the God of Israel, saying: 'Oh that Thou (Lord) would bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that Thine hand might be with me, and that Thou would keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me!' And God, granted him that which he requested"" (I Chronicles 4:9-10 KJV). It's all here... on this 6-disc, DVD Set. The DVD's have various running times but one thing is for sure, the subject matter on each DVD is engaging and educational, in it's presentation. It's leisurely learning while simultaneously revealing about the history, archaeology and scriptural contents. This compiled READER'S DIGEST CLASSIC COLLECTION is a concise and accurate DVD collection, that is based upon various historical texts as well as, per the pages of the Holy Bible. All in all, it's a unique 6-disc, DVD collection that is also a lasting gift. Nina Kish",1437955200,,2124,4.932960893854749
