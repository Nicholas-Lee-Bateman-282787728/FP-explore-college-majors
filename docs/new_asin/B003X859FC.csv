4215953,5,B003X859FC,"NEW REVIEW OF THE ""REMASTERED"" MAHLER 2 BLU-RAY (MARCH 17TH 2011):

Well, EXACTLY six months after reporting the audio issue affecting the first blu-ray release of this concert, the day has finally come when the revised verion arrived at my door and it has been worth the wait!  I can't comment on player compatibility issues, because I never had them, but I've watched the ""remastered"" Mahler 2 BD from start to finish now and can conclude that the sound is absolutely fantastic all the way through, just as it was on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B000A16SIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>.  The picture is of course a clear improvement over the DVD, but that was already the case on the earlier BD and I see no difference there.

Traces of the struggle to ""get it right"" this time can still be detected though, but it depends on viewers' indivual sensibilities as to how distracting they'll find it.  Something I hadn't noticed before on the earlier, bad sounding BD (probably because I was already so turned off by the poor sound) was that at some points the picture and the audio weren't in perfect synch with each other.  A good example of that can be seen early in the 3rd movement where one of the percussionists makes a rhythmic sound with a straw bush on the big drum; on the DVD the picture and the sound are in synch, but on the earlier BD it was not quite in synch.  The NEW BD actually magnifies that issue; it's even a bit more out of synch, with the sound of the beats falling perfectly BETWEEN the visual beats (actually the audio lags a bit behind the video).
One can see this fluctuating regularly; long stretches are perfectly (or nearly perfectly) in synch and then at some points the audio and video go out of synch a bit, but then at the next shot everything is in synch again.
The vocal parts luckily show no synch issues, as I suspect most people would be the most annoyed about.  This thing must have something to do with the fact that there were different SD and HD video edits of the concert, so it doen't really surprise me.
All in all I think it's a small price to pay for a BD version that finally has great sound and fine picture quality, and it's certainly not going to stop me from upgrading my star rating from 1 to 5 now.  Bravo to everyone involved in making this happen!

One thing that will be an issue in the coming time is the old BD still floating around in the distribution chain and lots of online and ""terrestrial"" stores also, which is part of the reason why I'm still keeping the text of my old review below for everyone to see.  Unfortunately there's no way to tell from the packaging if one has the correct version or not.  The only way to know the difference is by removing the cellophane and checking the code on the inner ring of the data-side of the disc, which is different from the previous BD.  These are the codes:

Old: A0101642381-A511
New: A0101729797-A511

The latest info from Euroarts says that there are indeed still some old ones around, but if anyone still encounters one of them, just notify the outlet you bought it from or contact Euroarts directly.  It will be dealt with and you'll get a correct disc one way or the other.

OLD REVIEW OF THE FIRST BLU-RAY EDITION OF THIS CONCERT (SEPTEMBER 17th 2010):

Let me start by saying that the actual concert on the blu-ray is one of the best I've ever seen, but my review - which is actually a near copy of a comment I placed earlier under another review - will not be about that.

I had already ordered this one from the UK near the end of August and noticed something was wrong within seconds when I heard almost EVERY sound coming from the front speakers alone, and I'm talking about the 5.1 mix here, *not* the stereo. The mix sounds as flat as a pancake and doesn't even begin to compare with the 5.1 mix on the DVD, or the glorious 5.1 mixes for the BD's of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-1-Prokofiev-Piano-Concerto-No-3/dp/B0040Y7EUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler Symphony No. 1/ Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-3/dp/B002P9K9SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler Symphony No. 3</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-6/dp/B003X859FM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler Symphony No. 6</a>&nbsp;(buy those, buy those, they're great!!). I contacted Euroarts tech support immediately and one of the people who handled the actual production of the BD confirmed that it's a result of different video & audio versions that exist for this title.

Basically the SD video edit was different to the HD-Cam, so the original DVD-version 5.1 audio didn't match the HD-Cam picture or stereo audio.  It was decided there wasn't time to re-edit the HD-Cam video & stereo audio to match the 5.1 mix, so the stereo was used to make a new 5.1.

This has two problems:

1 - A 5.1 conversion seldom sounds as good as a real 5.1 mix, but more importantly

2 - The HD-Cam stereo soundtrack had been heavily limited, meaning that the loud sections were significantly reduced in level.

This is common in broadcast for TV, which is probably what happened here. These two factors together explain the difference between the BD 5.1 and the DVD 5.1. The problem is that to correct this would involve significant time and expense...

So, due to time and money constraints they found themselves forced to use a clearly sub-par stereo source to create a pseudo 5.1 mix that doesn't even begin to sound like one; it has zero depth and lacks all the refinement the original 5.1 mix had on the DVD of the same concert, all because it's a helluva job (really, it is) to create a brand new HD video edit of the concert which will actually fit just as seamlessly as the original SD video edit did with the original 5.1 mix. You see, if they'd just combine the HD video edit as it is right now with the original 5.1 mix, the whole thing would be totally out of synch. A complete overhaul will therefore be needed to turn this into a product worthy of the concert itself and of the BD format.
My personal opinion is that they never should have released it. They should have just taken their time and release it at a later date, concurrently with one of the other Mahler/Abbado performances that will still be appearing on BD in the near future. The guy from Euroarts said they really need to see how they'll be handling this (I actually urged a temporary recall of this BD until the issue is resolved) but at the moment it's not clear what will happen, because fixing this will take time and ehm... money. I'll gladly keep you guys updated on any news regarding this in the comments section!",1284681600,30,7074,5.075862068965518
4215954,5,B003X859FC,"It was about time these recordings started to get released on the format they were thought for after the appetizer of the Third Symphony from 2007(all Lucerne concerts were filmed using HD since the first year). I should receive this one in a cpuple of days as it is out in Europe already. However, it wasn't available directly at the Lucerne Festival yet (was there in the past days).",1283644800,,385,4.594202898550725
8407812,5,B003X859FC,"I think I probably like Abbado's version of the Resurrection better than even Bernstein. So much feeling for the music, the orchestra and the man, Mahler. Wonderful DVD that you never grow tired of watching and listening to...simply beautiful.",1440460800,,243,5.256410256410256
8407813,5,B003X859FC,"Ever wonder what would happen if you hand-picked an orchestra from among all the best musicians from all over Europe under the charge of one of the greatest Italian conductors of the 20th /21st century? No need to guess: we have it in the recordings of Claudio Abbado conducting his Lucerne Festival Orchestra.

I compared Abbados Mahler Symphony No. 2 with several others, including two other outstanding Blu-rays, by Riccardo Chailly and Pierre Boulez, and the Bernstein DVD from a 1973 performance at Ely Cathedral. I found Abbados interpretation a little fast and slightly glib in the second movement; Chailly and Bernstein took it slower and found better ways (than speed) to hold interest. On the other hand, Abbado elicited some exquisite loveliness from this same second movements inner sections.

Concerning the audio, the Abbado recording seems, like the Chailly, to have unfettered dynamic range. Chaillys, however, has more impact, due to the way the various instrumental and choral sections were miked and balanced, giving greater emphasis to bass and to the percussion, and perhaps also to the vocal soloists. Although I found those balances to be very much to my likingto the point that I find this and Chaillys Eighth, recorded during the same festival, to be one of a handful of the best recordings I have ever heard, some people, purists in particular, will sense too much intervention by the engineers: there is more attention to individuals, such as the vocal soloists, than one would ever hear from one seat in a concert hall; still, they are kept at bay sufficiently to allow the volume to be turned high so that when the climaxes come they are truly stupendous.

Here are the results of my 4-way comparison:

Best orchestra: The Lucerne Festival Orchestra.

Best mezzo: Janet Baker in the Bernstein and Petra Lang in the Boulez.

Best sound: The Chailly is the most impressive without being overbearing; the Abbado, the most natural. The Bernstein is simply not in the running.

Best conducting: Nearly a four-way draw, but I would narrow it down to Bernstein & Abbado as slightly preferable.

Best video: While all 3 Blu-rays are equally clear, the lighting and locale of the Chailly provide an especially pleasing and interesting view. If you like the old-fashioned warmth of film, you may like the Bernstein in spite of its low resolution. The Abbado is set in the visually uninteresting Lucerne Culture and Convention Center.

It is all but impossible to choose a favorite among these; much depends upon how one weights the various categories. For knock-your-socks-off production values, I'd choose the Chailly; but for sheer poetry and natural sound I'd say that Abbado is the safe choice.",1421712000,,2717,5.033407572383074
8407814,5,B003X859FC,"The  performance of this symphony, the composition of this symphony itself is totally masterful.. Both soloists present such beautiful and thoughtful music. Anna Larsson , I think, is heavenly. Any serious musician should be familiar with this recording..",1404518400,,255,5.7105263157894735
8407815,5,B003X859FC,"This is a great complement and supplement to the Concert for New York, and it shows the beauty of the piece as a stand alone item.  Very moving.",1357689600,,144,4.142857142857143
8407816,5,B003X859FC,"Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This has been further reinforced by his set of performances held at Lucerne with his hand-picked orchestra constituting the Lucerne Festival orchestra.

This very large orchestra, apart from containing musicians of outstanding individual abilities, also lays great stress upon their empathy and experience with the world of chamber music. Thus is achieved the unusual combination of orchestral size allied to individual and corporate sensitivity. This suits Abbado's particular vision of Mahler and is apparent throughout this performance which could be described as both visionary in style and inspirational in effect.

The generously spacious layout of the orchestra allows the camera work to achieve equivalent sensitivity of detail as well as panoramic effect. The surround sound on DVD was initially superior to the original Blu-ray version which used a surround effect based on the stereo recording. The reason for this was a breakdown of the Blu-ray surround sound recording equipment. The original stereo on both DVD and Blu-ray captures all of this with admirable lucidity.

HOWEVER, following on from considerable customer protest regarding the fake surround sound on the Blu-ray, the genuine DTS surround sound has now been transferred over from the DVD soundtrack. This is a far more complicated process than it might seem as synchronisation can be problematical. The considerable effort has been a major success and any problems that remain are infinitesimal and should not be an issue with those who value Abbado's unique vision in this work.

The upcoming series planned by Chailly, also on Blu-ray, might become a serious competitor to Abbado however. His Mahler 2 is now available and some find it preferable - certainly as sound which is faultless. Both of these versions are equally satisfying in their different ways (see my Chailly review for further details). Abbado can be highly recommended in its new re-processed form.",1343520000,,2033,5.403785488958991
8407817,5,B003X859FC,This is the first blu-ray I have ever purchased. The performance is one of the best I have heard - and I have heard many live as well as recorded ones. You can't go wrong with this one.,1338854400,,185,3.8947368421052633
8407818,1,B003X859FC,"A very disappointing experience.  To make a long story short, the disc hangs at the beginning of chapter 5 (4th movement) and will not continue.  Received a refund notice  which is a good thing (thanks Amazon) but I was looking forward to the complete Mahler/Abbado/Lucerne cycle for it's uniqueness in concert history but alas, it looks like a blu ray ""Resurrection"" from these forces is not in the cards.",1289088000,,406,4.855072463768116
8407819,1,B003X859FC,"I, too, have the same issue at the 4th movement. (I think it's track 5)

I exchanged once thinking the disc I received was at fault, but the replacement has the exact same issue.
Glad i'm not alone with this problem.

I end up returning this 2nd DVD for a refund. What a disappointment on this superb performance.",1286409600,3,318,4.372881355932203
8407820,1,B003X859FC,"First, let me say that the other blu-ray releases of Abbado/Lucerne concerts have been wonderful -- especially the Mahler 3rd.  And the Mahler 6th, issued concurrently with the Mahler 2nd, is excellent, too.  But this disc freezes after the menu.  The menu appears, I press ""Play,"".... and the screen goes forever dark.  The same thing happens when I try to access it through the chapter index.  This happened on BOTH the discs I ordered (the second one was a replacement for the first).  EuroArts deserves high praise for issuing these concerts.  They are some of the most important events to have occurred in decades -- transcendent playing, led by the greatest conductor of his generation, in visually and sonically superb productions.  Which makes it all the more frustrating that this particular disc doesn't work.  (The standard disc, released years ago, is fine, with no problems).  EuroArts discs have set the standard for excellence in their other blu-ray releases (and standard releases, too).  They should withdraw this one and get a corrected version out on the market where it deserves to be.",1285891200,10,1105,5.0497237569060776
8407821,5,B003X859FC,"I feel it is only fair to add my praise to what Euroarts has done in re-mastering this blu-ray disc. I was very critical of the original release for its poor and ""artificial"" surround sound, which wasn't a patch on the DVD version. The reasons for this are described in other reviews but Euroarts' efforts in going back to the original ""surround"" sound tracks and matching these to the original HD visuals is little short of remarkable. True, there are places where the sound and picture are not perfectly synchronized (even in the vocal solos in the last movement) but these are hardly noticeable, and never distracting. You would have to be very picky for this to affect your enjoyment of such a touching and involving performance. The picture, as you would expect, is a clearly better than that in the original 2003 DVD, but the sound too has been greatly improved, with separate details coming through from the melange of sound in places that I had really not heard in the DVD version. The 2003 DVD sound was spectacular but this is much better, almost, but not quite approaching, the best of the more recent Lucerne Mahler blu-rays. Overall, there is no doubt this is now the Mahler 2 to have.",1284940800,13,1198,4.65566037735849
