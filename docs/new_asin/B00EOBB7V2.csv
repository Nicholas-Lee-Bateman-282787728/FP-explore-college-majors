5929793,5,B00EOBB7V2,THe overall collection is a lot of fun to watch and gives you a chance to revisit your youth. I was very impressed with the film transfer to DVD,1395532800,,144,4.0
5929794,4,B00EOBB7V2,"For a good comprehensive review see Ron Wise's notes herein. I would just like to add the following. 6 excellent B/W Prints, both picture and sound (differing ratios, 4.3 and 16.5 for some, but that didn't worry me one bit). Good solid unpretentious, if a bit dated now, fun. But...Just a word of warning. If you have sensitive very young children, or are just like me, be aware that SAFARI DRUMS has a prolonged and vicious fight staged by the film crew Bomba is guiding between a lion and a tiger, and THE GOLDEN IDOL has an equally nasty fight between a wild boar and aq tiger. Now I have no way of knowing if the animals were hurt or if it was stock footage. It doesn't matter. To me it was very unpleasant and I feel I had to say something. Apart from that reservation-All good!",1386547200,,783,4.333333333333333
5929795,5,B00EOBB7V2,"In this second series enjoy the last six movies which are: African Treasure, Bomba and the Jungle Girl, Safari Drums, The Golden Idol, Killer Leopard and Lord of the Jungle.

Relive an era when Tarzan was all the rage and Johnny Weissmuller was on most people's lips, and Johnny Sheffield played 'Boy' who became Bomba later.

Bomba may not be as strong or as fast as his predecessor, but he still gets the job done and his jungle friends are always ready to help out.

There is more thrills in the jungle as Bomba has to deal with treasure hunters, diamond smugglers, chases after a leopard that kills for fun, saving more damsels from themselves and more in this excitement-filled series.

Enjoy the last in the five star series on region free dvd (although The Golden Idol would not work at all) and add it to your library of old television series. You shouldn't be disappointed.",1385856000,3,882,4.634615384615385
5929796,5,B00EOBB7V2,"There's only one actor who could have ever played the role of Bomba, the Jungle Boy, and he was the great Johnny Sheffield.  Johnny was from a show business family and he learned his cinematic ropes from none other than Johnny Weissmuller when he was chosen to play ""Boy"" in the MGM Tarzan movies.  When Sheffield outgrew that part, Monogram Studios signed him for the role of Bomba in a series of 12 films that ran from 1949 to 1955.  This Warner Archive box set collects the final six jungle adventures, and they are as follows:

1. ""African Treasure"" (1952, 70 min.):  Bomba saves a young woman, portrayed by exotic beauty Laurette Luez, from a killer lion. Her name is Lita and she tells Bomba that she is in the jungle looking for her missing father who is a geologist. Bomba vows to help Lita, and soon they discover a village where all the natives have been massacred by a gang of ruthless diamond hunters. Bomba discovers clues in the village that he hopes will lead him to the killers, Lita's father, and a lost diamond mine.

2. ""Bomba and the Jungle Girl""  (1952, 70 min.):  This fast-paced film is one of the best of the series.  Bomba is determined to learn the fate of his parents and begins a trek through the jungle to discover the truth. He soon encounters a young woman swimming in a river and saves her from crocodiles. She is Linda, played by stunning actor Karen Sharpe (who later married director Stanley Kramer).  Linda takes Bomba to a nearby village to meet her father, a government surveyor.  There Bomba meets the tribal chief and his daughter who immediately begin to act suspiciously toward Bomba.  The Jungle Boy suspects that they know more about his parents than they are telling.

3. ""Safari Drums"" (1953, 71 min.):  A group of headstrong filmmakers invade the jungle looking for cheap thrills to film, even if it means killing animals in the process.  Bomba saves one of their party, a petite brunette named Peggy, from a leopard in a cave, and soon is acting as guide for the group in order to protect the animals.  Peggy is played by Barbara Bestar who later appeared in the cult classic ""Killers From Space.""  The territorial police send a message to Bomba via jungle drums that one member of the film group is a killer and Bomba must determine which one.

4. ""The Golden Idol""  (1954, 71 min.):  Evil Prince Ali kills a Watusi chief, a friend of Bomba's, and steals the tribe's golden idol. Bomba manages to regain possession of the idol and hides it in the jungle.  Prince Ali hires a mercenary and plans  to track down Bomba and take the idol.  In the meantime, a pretty blonde archeologist, played by Anne Kimbell, finds Bomba and wants the idol for a museum.  Bomba tells her that the Watusi chief's dying wish was that the idol could be sold and the money used to help his people, but Prince Ali and his henchmen have other plans.

5. ""Killer Leopard""  (1954, 70 min.):  Beautiful movie star Linda Winters, played by cult favorite Beverly Garland, flies to Africa hoping to find her missing husband who has embezzled thousands from a movie studio.  In the meantime, Bomba is on the trail of a killer leopard that has been attacking humans.  Eventually, Bomba crosses paths with Linda who enlists his aid in finding her husband, but Bomba is not prepared for what he discovers when he finds him.

6. ""Lord of the Jungle""  (1955, 70 min.):  The final Bomba adventure centers around a trio of hunters hired by the territorial government to track down and kill a deadly rogue elephant. Their uncaring plan is to kill every elephant they see in hopes of killing the rogue.  Bomba learns of their plan and does everything in his power to thwart their efforts.  In the meantime, Asst. Commissioner Barnes' pretty niece Mona, played by Nancy Hale, pays him a visit and there she meets Bomba.  Soon a romance develops with Bomba and he soon has a courageous ally in Mona to help him save his elephant friends.

The Bomba jungle adventures were once widely popular with theater goers, and are still being enjoyed today thanks to DVD box sets like this one.  Thank you Warner Archive for making these and other great films available.  Keep in mind while enjoying this collection that those jungle drums you hear may be a message from Bomba to you, so listen closely!",1384819200,10,4298,4.606578947368421
5929797,4,B00EOBB7V2,If you like jungle adventures such as Tarzan you will like this DVD.  This is the second package of the 12 movie series.  The stories were well written and is great for juviniles.  Great plots with great morals for all of us,1383868800,,224,4.285714285714286
5929798,5,B00EOBB7V2,Thanks to a Amazon review I bought this 2nd volume of Bomba. There is an edge to the plots and the jungle boy is not introduced until the 'MaGuffin' or plot device is introduced. Bomba becomes more of an adventurer and a dark noir like shade propels the films.,1382400000,,260,4.326530612244898
5929799,5,B00EOBB7V2,"Too much fun-and memories-to pass up! I'm a kid again! I remember seeing Bomba first run in the theater, along with all the other classic-and not so classic-SF movies of the day. Shorts, newsreels and cartoons too! Production values were shoestring at best; California backlot, soundstage and locations around LA and environs, but still a lot of fun! Worth the money!
The DVD set (I have V1 too) play without problems-no glitches. I would have liked to have seen some extras like behind the scenes footage and similar but bringing back memories is enough for me. Enjoyed being a kid once again!-GPB",1380758400,,598,4.872549019607843

8607363,4,B00EOBB7V2,"Great memories of these films on local Sat programming back in the '60s. Perhaps a bit juvenile...but still enjoyable. Filmed in Africa...NOT! Jungle scenes filmed mostly at Baldwin Ranch in Arcadia, CA (now the famous LA County Arboretum)...with other locations at the more scenic Corrganiville Movie Ranch in Simi Valley and a few scenes at Bronson Canyon in Hollywood. Interiors filmed at Nassour Studios and Monogram Studios on Sunset Blvd.  ""Bomba and the Jungle Girl"" is especially enjoyable...Warner Archive has used the best source material available...and transfers are very good to excellent.

8607368,5,B00EOBB7V2,"I used to watch these movies when I was a little boy.  I loved all of the Tarzan movies - the Ron Ely tv show, shows like Jungle Jim etc.., and this series of movies.  Johnny Sheffield who stars in the role of Bomba, The Jungle Boy also played the role of ""Boy"" in the 1939 Johnny Wiessmuller Tarzan movie ""Tarzan Finds A Son"".  Great Stuff.  If you get both volume one and two you will have all of the Bomba The Jungle Boy movies ever made.",1423612800,,441,4.0344827586206895
