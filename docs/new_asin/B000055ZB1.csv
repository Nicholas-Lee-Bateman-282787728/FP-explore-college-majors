Great opening scene, some nice spaghetti elements held down by a lousy score and a  lead with no presence who doesn't resemble in the least a 'half-breed'. Camaso is good but you have to wait for him.  3 / 5",1525737600,,264,4.36734693877551
7931411,5,B000055ZB1,"Director Margheriti is well known for his long list of fast, cheap but well-made horror, sci-fi and action films. As Westerns were so popular in the late 60s he dabbled in that genre also and made some good films. VENGEANCE along with his other late 60s Western AND GOD SAID TO CAIN, This is still fine entertainment for European pop cinema fans because all the elements of this genre are present (zooms into squinting eyes, impossibly fast gundowns, fuzz guitar laden score, seemingly invincible anti-heroes defeating scummy bad guys).",1523145600,,536,5.033707865168539

7931413,2,B000055ZB1,"Old time spaghetti western and not done very well, they seemed to be trying for Hang Em High and fell really short. Not much to say except that the acting is bad, the action is bad and some of the scenes are so long and drawn out it is painful. Richard Harrison....the ""star""? shows very little emotion at any time. I wish I would have passed on this one.",1404604800,,355,4.159420289855072

7931415,5,B000055ZB1,"Image Entertainment delivers an intense, revenge Spaghetti Western Directed by Genre auteur Antonio Margheriti aka Anthony Dawson and starring Euro actor Richard Harrison in one of his best roles in 'VENGEANCE' aka 'JOKO, INVOCA DIO...E MUORI'- 1968.  Co-scripted with Renato Savino, Harrison plans on getting back at the men who tortured and killed his brother.  The lead villain is played by Claudio Camaso who is the brother of Euro actor Gian Maria Volonte who played memorable villains in Sergio Leone's first two Dollars films and Director Damiano Damiani's classic 'A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL' aka 'QUIEN SABE?'-1966.  The atmospheric photography is by Margheriti's favorite cameraman Riccardo Pallottini and the excellent music score by Carlos Savina rounds out the mix.  Blending the Gothic Horror genre with the Western was few and far between sometime appearing over the top as in Director's Guilio Questi's 'DJANGO KILL...IF YOU LIVE SHOOT' aka 'SE SEI VIVO SPARA'-1967 with its Edgar Allan Poe-ish climax but Margheriti blends the atmospherics as a painter approaching his canvas.  The title seems to be rare and the price is steep but every Western fan will not want to be with out this one.",1309651200,4,1203,5.212435233160622
