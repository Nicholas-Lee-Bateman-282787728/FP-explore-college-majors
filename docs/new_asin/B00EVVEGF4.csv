8609989,2,B00EVVEGF4,"Acoustic efforts are fine if you have the jam to pull it off.
Unlike some other worthy acoustic efforts this one is a bust I am afraid.
The video when on the subject is crystal clear but the sound is a 2 out of 10 with a scratchy Adams clawing out a full score.
Not a good effort an from older Bryan Adams  that is almost fatiguing.
Any thought of paying 38.00 for this is absurd.
I was lucky enough only to get stung for 16.50.",1399680000,,428,3.9767441860465116
