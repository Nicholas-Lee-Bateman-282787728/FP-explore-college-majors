7954643,3,B00005UM1U,"The Beatles--The Beatles Story gives us a retrospective history of the rise and fall of the world's greatest rock and roll band. The sound is good; the events are explained in a clear and concise manner and the quality of the archival footage is pretty good, too.

Unfortunately, as other reviewers note, we don't get any footage of The Beatles performing their songs with the sound of them singing--we get just a few video only clips here and there. Much of the sound is from a modern day band imitating The Beatles for a quick buck.

On the other hand, there are redeeming features about this documentary. I enjoyed the interview with Ray McFall, the man who owned The Cavern Club at the time that The Beatles performed there. McFall remarks that their energy was singularly strong and remarkable even when recalled decades later. McFall clearly admired the band and he makes a good person to interview.

In addition, we get interviews with people like Mersey Beat editor Bill Harry and others who give both insight and their own personal memories about the group. We hear stories of the good times when The Beatles could do no wrong; and we see footage of The Beatles having a tough time in concerts when the fans were so loud Ringo was actually playing one song while the other three played another--and none of the band members were aware of this until a chance comment happened to expose it after the show was over. In addition, the movie touches somewhat briefly on Apple, the company founded by The Beatles about the same time that their manager Brian Epstein died.

While the documentary is strong on interviews with people who both knew and knew of The Beatles, it is woefully lacking in terms of much input from the remaining members of the band. We get some very brief archival clips but never anything substantial.

The DVD comes with a timeline that I found to be very informative. The only other ""extra"" is scene selection. Sigh.

I recommend this DVD for the casual Beatle fan or for people just becoming aware of The Beatles. This probably would disappoint diehard fans; they will know too much of this material already.",1196294400,3,2137,4.7005347593582885
7954644,5,B00005UM1U,"This is a MUST have for Beatle scholars.  This work contains interviews that are well documented throughout the Beatles' careers, such as John's infamous ""bigger than Jesus"" comment in 1966.

The film footage of the group as well as their music is sure to delight all who watch this.  As much as I love it and can jump readily in and understand this work at any point, it IS on the advanced end of ""Beatle knowledge"" and as another reviewer pointed out, for people interested in becoming familiar with the Beatles, ""Anthology"" might be a more ""learner friendly"" starting point.

Still, I love this one and heartily recommend it, yeah, yeah, yeah!",1083024000,2,646,4.741071428571429
7954645,4,B00005UM1U,"If you're new to the Beatles, then DON'T start here.  This is a bisic overview to the Beatles, but does not go into enough depth to fully understand and contains no music.  If you're a die-hard fan, then I would go ahead with it, because thereis some unique footage and spectacular interviews on this disc; the highlights for me are the footage of the Bootleg Beatles and the way Paul talks back to the press about his taking LSD.  There is also 1966 footage of  interviews with the radio stations about John's ""bigger than Jesus"" statement, as well as with fans about how they reacted.  The fascinating footage and the unique interviews make this DVD great.  However, if you are new to the Beatles, start with the ""Anthology"" boxed set.",1028678400,7,737,4.630769230769231
