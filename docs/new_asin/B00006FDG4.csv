1746023,5,B00006FDG4,"I missed this special when it was originally broadcast on CBS last year, so I bought the DVD just so I could see it, not expecting to be overly impressed.  ""I Love Lucy"", one of the most popular sitcoms ever, and, in my opinion, the best, deserved a really great special to commemorate its 50th anniversary.  And let me tell you: it got one!  The people who put this show together did an outstanding job.  Of course, there are clips galore from both ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"", as well as brief interview segments with the surviving production team (inclucing three of the writers) and many celebrities. Cher, Roseanne, Whoopie Goldberg, Larry King, Barbara Walters, and Dick Van Dyke, just to name a few, share their fond memories of watching the show and provide some insight into the show's lasting popularity.  Some of the interviews are conducted on a mock-up of the original set: a very nice touch, since you don't often get to see 623 East 68th Street in color.  The show was produced by Desi Arnaz, Jr and Lucie Arnaz (who is looking surprising beautiful these days), and a short segment has them visiting Lucy's hometown, Jamestown, and the house she grew up in, and Desi Jr's reaction is quite touching.  Unfortunately, the show comes to a complete standstill while these two sing a song--not a bad job of singing, but it doesn't belong here (that's what the chapter skip button is for), but I guess they deserve their moment in the limelight for producing an otherwise highly entertaining piece of television.  There is a countdown of the ""ten best episodes"", not all of which would have made my personal ten best list, but good choices none-the-less. Also, some of the original animated openings and act-changes are used to good effect, between segments and commercial breaks (and, this being DVD, there are no commercials, thank goodness).  There are no extras, but the show is so full of ""everything Lucy"", you don't need any.  This DVD will make a great companion piece to a collection of the Lucy DVDs that are currently being released, and is a must for any ""I Love Lucy"" fan!",1033689600,17,2112,4.7146739130434785

1746089,1,B00006FDG4,I shouldve made sure I had a better understanding of this product before purchasing because I wouldve passed. I love the show & thought this was simply a collection of episodes but Is more biographical If that interests you then youd probably be more satisfied than I was. I personally have already done research on the show and main actors so I didn't learn much new information from this. If interviews with Lucille & Dezi were included It wouldve been better. I still get enjoyment from watching episodes though! ,1427155200,,516,4.797752808988764

1746187,5,B00006FDG4,This was an original run show in honor of the 50th Anniversary of I love Lucy which originally aired in 2001. It was fun to watch and would recommend it to any fan of the show.,1233619200,,176,3.9166666666666665

Several never before told stories are included and guest star interviews are insightful and well done.

DVD quality is excellent and the production is equally superb.",1168819200,10,400,4.685714285714286
1746190,5,B00006FDG4,"I've always been a fan of anything with the ""Queen of Comedy""--but this had to be The Best!!  Seeing other celebs give their views of how I LOVE LUCY impacted development of TV was good, but this rare showing of Lucie & Desi Jr. together made it terrific! There was NOTHING ""STAGED"" about the children's love for their parents! Desi Jr's emotions at seeing his mother's birthplace for the first time was so heartfelt; and their blend in ""Patria"" honoring their Dad was just great!) Having them in this tender (& lovingly emotional) family tribute made this the ""creme-de-la-creme"" for me!
  This tribute is a true gem--not just to great actors, but showing the bond of love that makes a family.  ""FAMILY""--just one wonderful value that made us love the series then--and why WE STILL LOVE LUCY today!!",1127433600,8,800,4.77536231884058
1746191,5,B00006FDG4,"I LOVE LUCY!! This show was really a big hit. It was bigger than big. In this video they go behind the scenes of ""I Love Lucy."" They even go to Jamestown, New York to show you where Lucille ball grew up. They talk about Lucy and Rickys childhood backgrounds. This is full of information that any Lucy fan would find interresting if you don't know it already. Its worth the money. They even have celebrities who talk about what they thought about the show with Whoopi Goldberg starting out the video. This is for any Lucy fan. They also count down the top 10 most popular Lucy episodes in the video. Get it while you can. Its worth it!! This is suppose to be the VHS version.",1050710400,27,674,4.2734375
1746192,5,B00006FDG4,"Read the descriptions of items before you buy them.  It clearly says ""...with vintage clips from the selected episodes...""  Clips does not mean full episodes.  Personally, I thought this was an excellent DVD about the history of ""I Love Lucy.""  And guess what, reviewer from Russia, in order to have a history video, you must have information on the actors.  This video provides accurate information about all aspects of the show, characters, actors, and the actors' personal lives.  The very special part is that they got Lucie and Desi Jr., the children of Lucy and Desi, to comment on the show and on their parents, as well as sing a revitalization of ""Babalu.""  A must have for any ""I Love Lucy"" enthusiast.",1044835200,24,711,4.778688524590164
1746193,5,B00006FDG4,"As much an homage as it is a documentary, ""The `I Love Lucy' 50th Anniversary Special"" is ideal for those who would love to find out just why the legacy of Lucy lives on. The special features vintage clips from some of Lucy's funniest and famous skits, as well as interviews with those performers who have been inspired and influenced by the red-hot redhead, including Whoopi Goldberg, Cher, Paul Rodriquez, Lily Tomlin and Dick Van Dyke. Some of the guests will surprise you, such as Antonio Banderas, Andy Garcia and Larry King. [One interesting sidenote: Roseanne Barr Arnold makes an appearance, yet in past interviews, Arnold was quick to boast about how much she did not love Lucy. Time for penance, Rosie?] Original ""I Love Lucy"" writers Madelyn Pugh Davis, Bob Carroll Junior and Bob Schiller, as well as other crew members, shed some insider insights into the Lucy legend. Desi Arnaz's genius is also honored, with a look at his Cuban
background and influence on Latin music in the United States. Latin music sensation does a knock-'em dead ""Babalu,"" on a stylized set so reminiscent of The Tropicana. Perhaps most touching is the visit Lucie Arnaz and Desi Junior make to Lucy's birthplace, Jamestown, New York ... it is Desi's first visit, and the camera doesn't shy away from the emotional experience. Add to that Desi and Lucie singing ""Patria"" (""Homeland""), a tune
especially written for the special, with multi-Grammy winner Auturo Sandoval on trumpet. Just marvelous!",1042934400,14,1483,4.983870967741935
