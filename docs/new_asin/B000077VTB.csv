1802226,2,B000077VTB,"Questions and then more questions and too few answers.  Watching the last part of this movie is like reading every other page in a novel and then wondering why the story seems devoid of relevant details.
While the movie has promise and the suspense is entertaining for awhile, the abrupt ending and nonsensical plot developments (if it can be called ""plot"") seem to bank on the notion that the viewer's imagination and confusion is all that this movie needs to build a conclusion.  Unfortunately this bank is empty.  There is no pay off to any time or thought invested in trying to figure out what you've seen.  You might as well debate other worldy topics without answers or conjecture about movie sequels that have not yet been written, because Disappearance definately will not have one.",1056585600,,790,4.82962962962963
1802227,4,B000077VTB,"The thing that amazed me most about this DVD is that the film was a made for TV thriller starring Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey (best known for their performances on L.A. Law) and although the plot may seem contrived to some viewers, I found it to be chilling, entertaining and well acted. Some viewers, I understand, were confused and unhappy with the conclusion (which I will not give away) but I believe the director's idea was to put you into this family's struggle and see it from their viewpoint, so maybe it's fair to say, all  questions should not be answered. In the tradition of the older, thinking-man's films, this movie leaves much room for discussion, which is sadly missing from a lot of today's supernatural thrillers where people always want set answers and happy endings. If you want this in this movie, then don't bother. If you are looking for something that is entertaining and leaves room for debate , this is YOUR type of thriller. Plot wise, all I'll say in synopsis is: Harry Hamlin plays a father of two whom has lost his wife five years previously. In an attempt to help with a bonding relationship with his children and his new wife (Dey) they embark on a vacation out west. Hamlin's son, an avid photographer has an interest in stopping in a ""Ghost town"" of Weaver to shoot some photos. But no one in the neighboring town of Stepford people claim to have never heard of the town. Well, they find Weaver ...or does Weaver find them?

Some critics may shun this movie for it's Stephen King/Twilight Zone overtones. There are many to be found here, throw in a sprinkle of Blair Witch for good measure. Harry Hamlin is great as the protective father and Susan Dey, sadly missing from today's films is a great highly underrated actress and does well as the protective stepmom whose expectations of bonding with her two new stepchildren are taken to a much higher level. You may remember Dey as Laurie Partridge from ABC's Partridge Family or as the tough but sexy DA Grace Van Owen from L.A. Law.

 Overall, I thought the movie had many chilling moments and suspense which will undoubtably earn it cult status if even only for it's ""Partridge Family"", ""LA Law"" and ""7th Heaven"" alumni. In the tradition of Stephen King, Twilight Zone and Night Gallery, this movie scores! Definately worth your time!",1045872000,21,2320,4.665036674816626

1802250,5,B000077VTB,"I had never seen this movie all the way through.  I would catch snippets here and there on TV, but always the in the middle.  I finally bought it on Amazon and watched it.  I loved it!  The script didn't waste a lot of time with background info on the characters.  With a short intro, it went right into the scary stuff.  It's implied that something evil is in the abandoned town.  And it can be whatever you want it to be.  Nothing is the way it should be in this place.  But that's what makes this movie great!  It doesn't need a lot of slash and gore to hit home.  Anyone out there afraid to get lost in the desert?",1219536000,3,618,4.024793388429752
1802251,4,B000077VTB,"Good production values on this suspenseful telefilm done for the TBS network. Writer/director Walter Klenhard is also responsible for the 1994 telefilm ""The Haunting of Seacliff Inn"". In ""Disappearance"" a family driving west in their SUV make a fateful decision to visit the ""ghost town"" of Weaver -- a town 23 miles off the main highway that is shown on maps from 40 years ago but not on current ones.

What goes on in that town is never fully explained. A number of possibilities are suggested but in the end the explanation is left to the imagination of the viewer. This works fine for me though it seems to have annoyed some other reviewers. At least it avoids any letdown from showing cliched mutants or aliens or Indian ghosts.

The fun part of this movie is in seeing the decisions the family makes, and the scenes and ideas along the way that suggest (never definitively) what might be behind it all. From the very first there's an atmosphere of quiet paranoia. Will they make it to the next stop or run out of gas in the desert? What's with the creepy little gas station and diner where everyone keeps to themselves and the hamburgers look like burnt hockey pucks? Why does no one admit to knowing about the ghost town of Weaver, even though one man advises the family to ""stay on the highway""?

When the family does decide to leave the highway, and actually finds the old ghost town, this feeling of paranoia gets stronger, and weird things start to happen. These weird events and the suspense over whether the family will escape is what makes the movie so enjoyable. Don't expect a full explanation or a happy ending. Just use your imagination and enjoy the ride!

""Disappearance"" was filmed in Australia, standing in for the New Mexico desert.",1195257600,3,1755,4.651612903225806
1802252,3,B000077VTB,"The acting was good. The writing started out being good, but then... Hu?

I don't seem to recall going out for a beer during the last ten minutes or so. Disappearance has a wonderful build-up, but ultimately went nowhere.

What a shame, I really wanted to like it, but it all fell flat.",1190419200,,286,4.377358490566038
1802262,2,B000077VTB,"Although there were some incongruities in the movie, it could have been a good one - the suspense was there and I watched it with interest but you kind of want to know the explanation at the end of the movie and it wasn't even something one could figure out.  Two possible explanations were given:
1. the ghost town was built on Indian burial grounds and those responsible for the problems encountered there were spirits
2. they detonated a neutron bomb there in 1948 - the people got away and hid and their kids were mutants.
But neither of these work for the end of the movie where the protagonists were apparently unharmed but we are not sure what is going on with them - maybe made into stepford people but very uncertain.  They are now living in the neighboring town (the one they first stopped at before they went to the ghost town).  No hint at what happened except a vague mention of aliens.  It's just like recording a movie and having it cut off just before the ending only you see the ending in ""Disappearance"" but it's a non ending with not so much as a hint about what is going on.  Too bad, it could have been a good movie - it definitely had its moments.  However, in my opinion, writing a good ending is an important part of the film and a film like Disappearance which gets sloppy with the ending is not worth watching.",1188864000,,1336,4.3453815261044175
1802263,5,B000077VTB,"Nearly every bad review I've ever seen of this movie has one thing in common: a bunch of people who apparently have never seen a horror movie prior to the turn of the century start whining about the ""bad"" ending and how you ""never see the monsters."" Let me put it simply: ever heard the phrase ""the thing we fear the most is the unknown""? It isn't a flaw in the movie that you never see the monster. It is a psychological aspect designed to make you think. Classic horror movies used to have actual suspense in them. Audiences nowadays have become so used to silly template horror flicks that spoon-feed them every piece of information that when one finally comes along that is brave enough to go back to the older - and better - Hitchcockian style of horror/thriller, the audience can't grasp the subtleties. It's a shame, really, because the movie is a remarkable piece of cinematic work.",1176076800,5,890,4.56875
1802264,5,B000077VTB,"I didn't like this movie because of what the previous viewer said, I liked this movie because it was a genuinely scarey movie. Yes, it did have some problems in the story line about what a group of people would normally do but other than that, it is a great story. True, it doesn't have all the gore that the other horror films have, but it doesn't need it either. I do recommend this film to anyone that likes the ""Hitchcock"" type of films.",1171756800,3,441,4.261904761904762
1802265,5,B000077VTB,"Although this is a cable TV movie, it is tame enough for broadcast TV; and that makes it a great 'thriller' movie for traditional values families.  There is a bit of bad language, but not too much.  This movie shows that you don't have to have gore or sex to create a very eerie, suspense-filled show.  I wouldn't say there are any real ethical issues for families to discuss; it is just a fun suspense movie that should be safe for kids from eight or ten years old and up.  My five stars is given in that context - a good suspense or 'thriller' movie for kids to watch with their parents.",1154044800,4,589,4.232142857142857
1802266,3,B000077VTB,"Well, despite some of the reviews this movie has gotten, Disappearance is a great movie!  Some people seem to think that the ending is terrible, but I would have to disagree.  Susan Dey is, of course, great, although it is weird because I've only ever seen her in ""The Partridge Family"" re-runs and to jump from 16 to step mom is weird to me.  Harry Hamlin is also great, although this is the first role I've seen him in.  The two boys also did a good job, however, the little girl is quite irritating in my opinion.  Overall, this is a good movie!!",1153699200,4,549,4.29126213592233
1802267,2,B000077VTB,"Looking back I can't believe I spent all that time watching the movie to see one crappy ending.  You will like the movie a lot right until you see the last 10mins that leave you thinking, ""What the hell just happened?""",1146787200,,218,4.317073170731708
1802268,3,B000077VTB,"This movie is pretty good up until the last 15 minutes or so of it.

I saw this part of this movie in a hotel room about a month ago, but had to leave before it was over.  I came on Amazon to buy it, and after reading the reviews, I was reluctant to buy it.  But I figured for under $10, it was worth it.

**Possible spoilers below**

As other reviewers have said, the ending is terrible.  It explains nothing about what happened during the movie.  If the ending was better, I would probably give this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating.",1145836800,3,533,4.019047619047619
1802269,2,B000077VTB,"Four years ago I was watching this movie, but had to leave before it was over, so I taped it.  Or so I thought.  Later when I watched the tape, I found I hadn't taped the end of it -

it stopped where the car turned over while they were leaving town.  Well, I've waited for 4 years to see the end of it, so today I watched it all the way through.  And I don't know much more now than when I missed the end!  I agree with previous reviews - bad plot!  Or at least not enough info to even be able to speculate what really happened.  It had potential, but never lived up to it.  sigh....",1145232000,,584,3.8403361344537816
1802270,4,B000077VTB,"I think it best to look at this film's technical qualities.  The environment was well put together.  Let's look at the technical aspects of the storyline.  All films follow a specific story formula.  They all begin with rising action, bringing us to the first twist or plot point.  That is the point in the film where things change from normality and we learn what the story is to be about.  For this film, the first plot point is when the family realizes their car doesn't work and they are stuck in the ghost town over night.  All stories lead us up to the second plot point which is generally near the end of the film.  I think what bothers most people about this film is its second plot point.  The final twist in the story.  Don't worry, I won't give it away here.  This final change to the story is drastic and too much for some people to accept.  It is definitely outside the realm of normal cinema.  Personally, I liked this second plot point and indeed the climax of the film, as it creates alot of intregue and actually allows us to use our brains.  Though we may never find the answer, we get our excersise.  In other words, this is not a film that allows you to vegetate in front of the screen having all minute details handed to you on a silver platter.  I suppose it seems to be a cross between an old radio show which left everything to the imagination and modern cinema which leaves nothing to the imagination of its viewers.  Basia A'hern, being a British-born Australian actress, her accent sometimes slips here and there away from the american.  At one point, she has almost a souther drawl.  I am not sure whether or not that was intentional.  Regardless, she was only 12 at the time.  I think that's why I gave this film only 4 stars instead of 5.",1107907200,2,1768,4.361963190184049
1802271,1,B000077VTB,"There is no greater cinematic sin to me than not giving an audience a resolution at the end of the film.  DISAPPEARANCE offends to the highest in that regard.  We are given an effectively good movie, with some atmospheric tension and lots of questions about what's going on in the town of Weaver.  Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey are fine in their roles, and Jeremy Lelliott is a good teen actor.  The moviemakers take us through all kinds of scenarios:  are these mutant descendants?  Government experiments gone haywire?  Aliens?  What's with the spooky cloud of dust?  What's with the asthmatic off screen presence?  Why are all the people seemingly being mind controlled?  Or are they dead?  What DID happen to Ethan when he is lost in the desert?  Do we get answers to these questions?  No, no siree!  And that my friends negates anything that was good about this movie, and the producers/writers/director should be ashamed for depriving their audience of any kind of clear cut answers.  And is the raven taking the pictures at the end?  My God, what a disappointing waste of time.",1107907200,2,1081,4.756756756756757

Mutant offsprings of the mutants from radiation? Who knows? Then, why/how did the family end up happily living in the town? Were the 'stalkers' body snatchers?

I thank God I got this thing at the library for FREE......even then the price was to high. This movie had no plot, no logic and no ending.

The acting delivered by Harry Hamlin, Susan Dey, and Jeremy Lelliot is solid.  Jeremy did an especially good job. His character took charge in certain scenes. The photography and sets were good, very authentic and believable.
The unseen, unknown ""stalkers"" were a part of the problem.  They are never seen and we are asked to believe that they might be a cloud of dust.  They breathe heavy and are apparently color blind, or perhaps possess a built in night vision.
Lastly, the movie ends terribly.  We're all so used to a happy ending that this one really disappoints.  Perhaps a little credit is due for a unique although disappointing ending.

1802277,2,B000077VTB,"I could say many good things about this move--I enjoyed most of it--but it was a ""cheat."" What I mean by that is the writers seemed to have come up with about a dozen ideas, wrote some dialog around that--then quit!
A movie doesn't have to have a ""Hollywood"" ending but, once a situation has been set up, it should have some consistent logic to it. In other words, no matter how weird or seemingly impossible a situtation may be (and I can accept everything this movie implied), the consequences should not be ignored.
Example: 20-some families have disappeared in the same area over a period of years. Wouldn't that have drawn LOTS of attention? And wouldn't searchers recognize the missing people who had been ""converted"" (or whatever.)
Most of the residents acted almost zombi-like. But the sheriff could easily pass for ""normal"" (even though he obviously was not.)
I could give many other examples. The best movies are those that make one think. But this movie took the lazy approach to that goal. They simply combined some elements of a scary movie, left out TONS of logic then quit--hoping that viewers would somehow connect the proper dots into a good movie.",1062892800,5,1165,4.772277227722772

The only good thing about this flick is that it eventually does end and go back to the video store, where it should rot on the shelf. I am more forgiving than the average film viewer, I mean I really want to be entertained.  I'm not one of those jaded film snobs.
