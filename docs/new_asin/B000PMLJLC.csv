2826354,5,B000PMLJLC,This is a great show if you like high-end cooking and are sick of those food network 'celebrity' chefs who have never been in a real kitchen before.  This is a good episode because you can learn some cool tricks.,1206576000,,212,4.3
8192700,2,B000PMLJLC,"I would have watched it with pleasure, but there were SO MANY ads that I couldn't. Maybe in another life where things are less commercial...",1482105600,,140,4.64

8192705,5,B000PMLJLC,"Because of watching this, we made it a point to go to Cafe Boulud when we went to New York.  Was not disappointed.  Food and service was very good.  If we have more time, we would have tried some of the other places they featured in the video.",1353974400,,243,4.020833333333333
8192706,5,B000PMLJLC,"If you are into food or dining out, this is great for a fun inside look at the food scene from the chefs and food people perspective.  You can pickup some nice info on how the food is prepared in a pro kitchen as well.  I just wish they had it in a BluRay HiDef format since this was telecast originally on an all HiDef network (the network was called INHD then MOJO).",1286323200,,368,4.027397260273973
8192707,4,B000PMLJLC,Such a great show!  It's great to learn about new restaurants and various chefs.  Not a lot of extras but good on it's own.,1261180800,,123,4.083333333333333
8192708,5,B000PMLJLC,"This is the first season of what was a great show on an even greater, yet short-lived, little cable channel called Mojo. Mojo had many enjoyable shows, but none more so than After Hours with Daniel Boulud. If you are at all serious about cooking and fascinated by the restaurant world, then this is definitely the show for you. It is the perfect blend of culinary content and late night talk show. Each episode takes place at a different well known restaurant. The host chef/proprietor and Daniel Boulud prepare a menu of dishes and serve them to a table of special guests, ranging from actors and entertainers to other chefs and restaurant industry celebs. The food figures prominently in the show, yet it still shares the stage with truly excellent conversation between the guests. The total product is a fun, informative, well shot and edited show. This DVD set earns a spot in any food lover's collection. My only hope is that seasons 2 and 3 will be released some day. You can watch them on Hulu in the meantime.",1253232000,,1017,4.655555555555556
8192709,5,B000PMLJLC,"This is a brilliant 2 disc set that features talented cooks- craftsmen\artists really- cooking and eating wonderful food while sharing great stories. Anyone who enjoys the topic of food & restaurants will enjoy this dvd. Watch episodes of ""After Hours With Daniel"" on Hulu.",1227657600,2,273,5.2272727272727275
