This movie is about a lesbian couple, transsexual, and some homeboys. And it goes as a triangle between all of them. It's very stupid and amateur. And I can't believe that Imdb has a good review on this garbage. It was a waste of five dollars and I really wouldn't watch it again if I even got offered me some money. I would not recommend this and just keep your money.",1414022400,,490,4.223404255319149
