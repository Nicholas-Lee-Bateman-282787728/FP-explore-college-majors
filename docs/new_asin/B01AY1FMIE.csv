7613980,4,B01AY1FMIE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

For many of us our first introduction to off kilter and subversive humor came in the form of a magazine that was on newsstands everywhere. For pre-teens it was less the humor that was involved that got our attention but the fact there was nudity in it and it wasn't hidden under the counter. But for those who loved a good laugh it was the premier source of humor to find at the time, our own generations humor as opposed to that of what was popular at the time. There is a huge difference between Henny Youngman cracking wise about his wife and a magazine cover that pictured a dog with a gun to its head that read Buy this magazine or well shoot this dog.

This movie takes a look at NATIONAL LAMPOON from its inception to its demise, covering all bases good and bad. A spin off of the HARVARD LAMPOON, the magazine was started by Doug Kenney, Henry Beard and Robert Hoffman. It was a humor filled magazine that parodied and focused on what was happening in the country, sort of like MAD magazine but from a more adult perspective. What the three of them did was bring in many of the most thought provoking comedy writers of the time to work for the magazine and in return its success skyrocketed.

You have to remember that these were the days before comedy clubs dotted the country and skit based comedy took over the airwaves. As a matter of fact it was from National Lampoon that many of those who went on to take over the airwaves began. As the magazine grew in popularity things happened that altered what was to come. Kenney left for a time leaving the magazine in the hands of Beard alone. A workaholic who helped create the tone of every issue, his disappearance had an effect on all involved.

But what helped move the downfall of the magazine as well was the departure of many of the staff members. As the magazine grew it evolved into a number of albums, weekly radio shows and stage productions involving those writers. NATIONAL LAMPOONS LEMMINGS was a record and stage show featuring both John Belushi and Chevy Chase. As those writers and performers left for shows like SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, the magazine suffered. Many other noted writers stepped in and did well but they too left.

The magazine got involved in movies in 1978 with the release of NATIONAL LAMPOONS ANIMAL HOUSE but by then the magazine sales were dwindling. More successful movies followed but the magazine had lost its punch, relegating itself to special issues, rehashes of old issues and more nudity rather than humor. Eventually it ended publication.

This documentary takes a look at all of that. Using a stills, filmed footage and numerous interviews with those involved it blends them together to take us through the magazine as it was and as it ended. It talks about the good and the bad, never whitewashing facts to suit those who loved it non-stop. In so doing it also reflects the evolution of comedy from that time period. Nearly every major comedy writer or humorist at the time had some connection to the magazine be it SNL writer Michael ODonoghue, political satirist P.J. ORourke or screenwriter John Hughes.

In some ways it was the success of the magazine that led to its demise years later. Coupled with a generation that relies solely on visual media and ignores printed matter there was little hope that the magazine could go on. Watching this movie makes that a sad realization that so much was lost when the magazine folded. But with this film many who weren't aware of the contribution to comedy that came from the magazine will be realized. Perhaps enough so that people will go back in search of old issues, maybe one fan will be inspired to create his own LAMPOON someday. We can hope.
Until then we can watch and learn from some of the most creative comic minds of the past century on screen here. It serves as a reminder that creativity and humor can walk hand in hand and inspire one another. And it lets others know that there was something funny long before they were born, something this generation seems to not realize yet. With this movie the proof is there. An interesting and delightful documentary that captures the time and the laughs in only 98 far too short minutes.",1462752000,5,4247,4.587615283267457

It captures what it was like to be on the cutting edge of humor and comedy at the time when National Lampoon changed American humor radically and permanently.",1469232000,2,363,4.352941176470588
7613988,4,B01AY1FMIE,"This excellent overview of the genesis, rise, and fall of the NATIONAL LAMPOON is both intoxicating and soberingand if you grew up with the LAMPOON (as I did) and experienced that rise-and-fall as a reader, you know of what I speak. This documentary digs into the people behind the LAMPOON, from its HARVARD LAMPOON-spawned founders to publisher Matty Simmons (who I worked for/with at HEAVY METAL at one point), from the initial misstep of Cloud Studios design elements/cartoons (ouch!) to the bleed into multimediastage shows, the LPs, THE NATIONAL LAMPOON RADIO HOUR, ANIMAL HOUSE, etc.it's all here, including how SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE! 'kidnapped' the NL team and mainstreamed its brand of satire, consiging the LAMPOON itself to eventual oblivion.

8748871,4,B01AY1FMIE,"Watching this I realized there was a ton I did not know about National Lampoon! There is a lot more to its history than Animal House and the Vacation movies. The business of publishing, the creativity in the writing and cartoons, the counter-culture aspect of the magazine during its time, the fact that college kids' reading habits mattered(!) at one time...there is something for everyone. Worth seeing!",1515628800,,405,5.059701492537314
8748872,2,B01AY1FMIE,"Lame documentary about a lame magazine. I was a charter subscriber back in the early 70s. The first issue had Holly Woodlawn as a centerfold. I was a mindless, uncritical fan, just as I was a mindless, uncritical consumer of all the other faddish junk of that era, the music, the drugs, the clothes. Has anything changed nowadays? I don't know.

The underground comics that were popular in the early 70s were so much better. It was all about the image, not a lot of boring text and screwy caricatures of famous celebrities and artifacts. The underground comics artists were creating their own personal visions and worlds. They had a lot more heart. And among the best of the undergrounds were the horror comics, which is something NatLamp couldn't touch. A lot of modern life isn't funny, it's horrible. And ""Fluide Glacial"" is much better today than Lampoon ever was. Why can't American have something like that now?

Never liked Chevy Chase. He was key? Never liked SNL, thought it was weak. Always thought Belushi was overrated as well.

Re: Simpsons: you need Harvard pinheads to pump their derivative, mimicking takes on things to you for a dry, knowing smile, well you're lost already.

Doug who? I remember reading about his death at the time and wondering who he was. He was just a name I'd seen on some articles. So what. Nonetheless, seeing Anne Beats laugh heartily about his death was pretty gruesome. And it's pretty telling that she compares herself to Catherine the Great and brags about basically ""whoring"" her way into showbiz (""on her back"").

The title of this documentary is retarded. The whole thing is such a fawning superficial mishmash.

I think the end for me (as a NatLamp fan) came when I read a long article about how aliens were looking for the powerful and elusive Aldo Ray, as if they were so stupid they didn't realize it was just the name of a 2-bit Hollywood actor. This is the kind of joke you'd come up with when your synapses are misfiring due to excessive caffeine intake. And it was a looooong piece. I remember the illustration, it was a picture of that famous sculpture of the big cube up on one of it's points with a big hole through the middle of the cube.

The real capper that made this documentary hard to take was the godawful music on the soundtrack. Harsh, blaring, inappropriate, in-your-face pop music. The filmmaker obviously realized how deadly his presentation of this material was so he decided to thrust loud, blaring music in the viewer's face to force them to feel excited about what they were seeing.",1515196800,,2559,4.698660714285714
8748873,5,B01AY1FMIE,Amazing documentary. It was great getting insight into the magazing and seeing so many SNL faces back when they were juat starting out.  Awesome interviews. Im 29 and this is something I would have been unknowledgeable about otherwise.,1501200000,,235,5.184210526315789
8748874,3,B01AY1FMIE,"I wish that I could be as enthusiastic about this documentary as many of the other reviewers. The National Lampoon is remembered today mainly as the source of much modern sexual and gross-out humor, as it is in this film. Like so many other cultural artifacts from the late 1960s and early 1970s, its political and social aspects have been forgotten. In its first five years, from April 1970 to January 1975, The National Lampoon provided a summa of contemporary political and social thought, and though this was presented in a manner that was anything but scholarly (naturally), the breadth of the writers' knowledge and the depth of their understanding was and remains astonishing. It is remarkable that nearly all of their observations and judgments remain relevant.
Each issue had a theme that the articles and pictorials more or less related to. Two of the most remarkable issues were from 1974. June's ""Food"" issue savaged American gluttony and addiction to junk food, and then July's ""Dessert"" issue contrasted that with the starvation frequently suffered in third-world countries. The theme of the August 1972 issue was ""The Miracle of Democracy,"" which included a long article of the same name by Doug Kenney that exposed just how undemocratic America really is. It included a brilliant horror comic book-like story by Michael O'Donoghue called ""Tales from the South,"" a reference to the old EC Comics ""Tales from the Crypt,"" which was based on the intertwined political careers of George Wallace and his soon-to-be-undead wife Lurleen. The January and December issues from 1972 contained the first and second installments of ""Son-O-God"" comics, which is a stunningly brilliant analysis of American political tendencies as they related to religion told from a reactionary point of view. Although the magazine had a reputation for attacking the political right and middle, it was not averse to savaging the counterculture that gave rise to it. It did this memorably in ""The Ventures of Zimmerman"" from the October 1972 ""Remember Those Fabulous Sixties?"" issue, another comic book-like parody that showed how the leaders of the 60s music scene, including Bob (Zimmerman) Dylan, ultimately sold out, like so many leading lights from that decade.
I could go on and on. The important thing about the Poon, as its devotees fondly call it, was how it placed American culture and politics under a microscope and carefully and intelligently picked them apart. What contributed enormously to the magazine's consistently high level of writing and design in the early years was the exceptional erudition of the writers (Sean Kelly even did a stint teaching English literature at Loyola College in his native Montreal). Sometimes their learning was obvious, but it was often concealed under heavy layers of appropriated vulgarity, cheapness, and banality. The Poon turned a mirror on America and showed it to itself, warts and all, with special emphasis on the warts.
There had never been a magazine like The National Lampoon, and I believe that there never will be one again. The original issues are still fresh and very entertaining. These can be purchased over the internet as PDFs or in hard copy form from various online vendors. Much valuable information about the magazine can be found on Mark's Very Large National Lampoon Site.",1500768000,,3332,5.149446494464945
