8414308,4,B0043988IU,"Great price for a pretty good series. Gad Guard isn't the best anime series youll ever watch, but its still 25 episodes of great story telling. The jazz soundtrack is awesomely paired with the series.",1408320000,,200,4.742857142857143

8414310,3,B0043988IU,"I had seen the first two episodes or so of Gad Guard back in 2009 when it was getting shown off as a freshly licensed anime. I really liked the premise shown, and a few years down the line decided to pick it up and watch it. Unfortunately, the story doesn't have an strong overall arc that pulls you in and keeps your interest. I felt like each time a new exciting element was introduced, they only let it ride out for one episode and then never mention it again. The basic premise is your main character Hajiki finds a Gad - a mech, for lack of a better classification - and goes on with his rather... uninteresting... teenage life, which includes other teenagers who have Gads. The human characters are likeable enough, but their Gads have humanoid features(look at the eyes!) yet remain completely emotionless through the entire series, resulting in a balance of... meh. The last few episodes proved to be a decent finale, but it wasn't enough to boost this over three stars for me. Probably not something I'll rewatch any time in the near future.",1390867200,,1050,4.560846560846561
8414311,5,B0043988IU,I used to see this on G4TV when they were still playing anime and when it was still good.  I can say times have changed but this anime was still as good as ever.  I mean it has mechs and children plus a plot you can sink your teeth into.,1354060800,,237,3.72
8414312,5,B0043988IU,"So, I picked up Gad Guard on a whim. It was cheap, I was broke, and I needed a new show to watch for a bit. I like some Mechas so I just decided to give this series a try, even though I had never heard of it. I watched it and fell in love with the show after a few episodes.

The show revolves around a kid named Hajiki. He lives with his mom and his sister in the poor area of town and Hajiki just wants to get enough money to get them out of town and into a better area. After he accidentily delivers a package to the wrong person, he catches them on the street and trys to get the package back. Some stuff happens and he gets a robot called a Techode. So its not a whole lot different from standard mecha shows, for now.

So with this robot he starts to try and clear out crime from the city while trying to figure out what techodes and gads (item used to make the techodes) are all about, and why people really want them. The action scenes are fairly good. They aren't anything to keep you on the edge of your seat, but they do a good job at holding your attention. There are some episodes though where there is no fighting, and while I don't mind them, some people probably won't like those that much.

While Gad Guard is just a normal mech fighting show, the series really takes off a little over midway through the season. Events happen and Hajiki ends up leaving his town, and even his country (I guess you could call it a country). This is my favorite part of the series as it becomes more of a reflection/soul searching story (its kinda hard to describe). This part of the story is where a lot of character development and questions about the gads and techodes are answered. I wish there could have been more of this spaced throughout the series.

In the end I feel that Gad Guard is a Terrific series. Even though it may seem out of place at first having different focuses about half way through the series they tie it together very well. I think you should definitely give it a watch if you like mechas or character driven stories.",1322611200,2,2043,4.177664974619289
8414313,2,B0043988IU,I love mecha animes! But this one was hard to watch. I couldn't stand the main kid. Heck I was liking the bad guys more then the good ones. When there's no action then its boring. Never watch this again.,1308873600,,203,4.1
