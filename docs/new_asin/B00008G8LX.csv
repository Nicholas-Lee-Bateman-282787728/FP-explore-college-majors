She is a GREAT actress and I do not think she has been given enough credit for her movies",1395878400,2,134,4.0
1845612,1,B00008G8LX,"Having met Morgan Fairchild many years ago, I have always been fascinated by her presence in movies and television. Had not known of this movie until finding it on Amazon Instant. Same your time on this foreign mess. To list Morgan as a featured 'star' of this one is a serious misrepresentation. If you take a break and do not pause you will miss Morgan. Don't pause at all and let this bad flick finish on its own....without you.",1361664000,3,431,4.468354430379747
1845613,3,B00008G8LX,"This is a cop drama/mystery/thriller?/ spoof? that takes place in the part of Berlin where everyone speaks English. Alex ( Armin Mueller-Stahl) is an old cop that people run away from as if he is a super cop. He has a dry sense of humor to him. While he is hunting a crime boss, a woman over doses on heroin. This leads him into the arena of drugs and brothels. He works with an assistant he doesn't initially like which adds to the dry humor.

Beck beer and Marlboro Lights product placement. People are heavy smokers, in fact a woman smokes while she is eating soup. There is some jazz detective music, but this is far from anything noir. While the film is not laugh out loud funny, it appears to have some humor we normally find in indie films.

The plot is not that great. The dry humor and flashback value would be the reasons to watch it. Also released under the title ""Killing Blue.""

1845614,5,B00008G8LX,"I have yet to read a single remark about this movie that makes me think anyone ever really watched it.

I did. Three times.

It's funny. It's also very European. It doesn't reflect an American sense of humor.

There's a gritty quality I really like. I find the visual aspect more than a little acceptable. The darkness of a lot of the scenes is moody, and evocative.

The core of the story has to do with the horrifying accidental wounding/disabling of a young child during an attempt to arrest a major drug dealer by the lead character, Inspector Alex Glass, played brilliantly by Armin Mueller-Stahl. We must observe the wretched condition of the man as the story opens.

He is sleepless, rumpled, irritable, and lacking in any kind of hope. All his life is sour, and he is being beaten down by the one terrible event of his existence, that has caused him to nearly lose himself.

Music is one of his few outlets. And then, there's the job. He has a new assistant, Shirley May, played wonderfully by Julia Kent, and a friend, the District Attorney, played by Michael York.

He also eventually finds himself involved with Lisa, an apparent bimbo, who manages to become another drop of the glue of life that keeps him from disintegrating.

I was not impressed by Morgan Fairchild the first time I watched the movie. Like most others making comments, I thought she was an absurd choice. That is, until I thought it over for a while. It dawned on me that she was actually perfect for the role, and when she threw her head back and laughed in one scene with Mr. Mueller-Stahl, I fell in love with the character, and with the actress. She was funny, sexy and pretty, as this character, and she was brave. Good for Lisa!

Alex is older than she. So what? We should all be so magnetic and well-preserved as we grow older. They're a rather odd couple. That does nothing but lend a spicy, amusing and rather sweet atmosphere to a very gruesome and sometimes terribly sad tale.

Frank Stallone was a great villain. I've seen him in other films, and I was so impressed by his talent, I couldn't figure out why the kid brother got so famous, and eclipsed him. The way the cookie crumbles I guess.

I recommend this as a movie that must be viewed with a sense of humor. And intelligence, because it isn't for dummies. It's a spoof of American cop pictures, where the hero never misses, and sex, as audience bait, takes the place of acting.

Yes, there's sex in this movie, and some of it is hilarious. However, there's never a glimpse of action on-screen. That's a nice change from all the sweating and heaving that goes on here in the US for the purpose of keeping our limited attention on the movie.

This story deals with a serial killer doing his thing, yet it isn't full of gore and splattered brains. In fact it's an excellent flick, in part, due to what you don't see.

See this movie. And use your noodle. Have no expectation, either good or bad, and you'll be pleasantly surprised!

Enjoy!",1226448000,9,2986,4.513914656771799
1845615,1,B00008G8LX,"Belongs on everyone's ""worst movies I have ever seen"" list. The color is terrible and the transfer is very bad.

Making Armin Mueller-Stahl the love interest of Morgan Fairchild is casting insanity.  He could easily be her grandfather so a good bit is lost trying to accept that twosome.

The movie itself is hard to grasp because the police station looks like a garage with busted toilets sitting in the hallways. Nothing is real about the movie plus it would appear the cameraman had no grasp of light versus dark.  At times, you can't even recognize where a scene is taking place because of the darkness.

Save your money and don't buy this DVD.  This is below a grade B movie...If there is a ""C"" movie or a ""D"" this would certainly qualify.",1092787200,5,744,4.556390977443609

Micheal York is always good. I really enjoyed this movie.  This movie takes place in Germany but they never say that and you have to watch close to figure it out.",1505260800,,339,4.380952380952381

7983519,5,B00008G8LX,"Midnight Cop deserves 5 Stars purely on the basis of it being such an odd disaster.

The direction has a certain level of ambition and is clearly trying to be an homage to the works of Fassbinder.  That being said this is also one of the most genuinely inept films of a decade famous for inept movies.

If anyone wants to discover a good-bad movie with a certain level of arthouse ambition then this is certainly an evening well spent.  Though I wouldn't advise watching it sober.",1483056000,,480,4.482758620689655
