1199146,5,B00000DBSE,"This might be the worst movie MST3K's ever put a torch to.  Manos, Red Zone, Beginning of the End, and some of the others look like exactly what they are.  Bad movies made for no money by hacks. This 70's jigglefest  looks like someone actually thought this was a good idea.  Plot?  Basically, it's any given ""Charlie's Angels"" episode put on by a  middle school acting class.
That this abomination had real actors in it  is incredible.  You'll cringe at Jim Backus and Peter Lawford.  And never  let it be said that MST3K is without heart.  You can actually hear Mike and  the bots groan when Backus and Lawford make their embarassing appearances.
Servo: Do you think Peter Lawford even knows where he is?
All in all,  the riffs were great.  But as with many MST3K's, that doesn't always dull  the pain.",946944000,,804,4.563380281690141
1199147,5,B00000DBSE,"This is an hilarious MST3K episode featuring an absolutely ludicrous movie that uses a serious premise as an excuse to make a ""jiggle-flick"".  The results are, as you might expect, atrocious, but hilariously atrocious when  Mike and his robot pals get through with it.  The less said about Palance  and Bacchus being in this, the better.  This movie demands to be featured  in Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension, where the aforementioned actors are sure  to get Embarrassed Actor Awards.",936835200,3,482,5.102564102564102
1199148,5,B00000DBSE,"I've owned this one for several months, but never managed to sit through more than the first 15 minutes.  This evening I apparently was feeling very masochistic, and I forced myself to watch the whole thing.
I absolutely can't claim to be an MST3K expert, but I've seen most of the shows... and this one is truly the worst I've seen.  Not that Mike and the bots are doing a bad job, but the movie is just... plain... horrible.  Yep, far worse than Manos, worse than the juggernaut otherwise known as Mitchell, and even Sidehackers looks like a primo piece of filmmaking expertise compared to the true awfulness of Angels Revenge.  None of the horror or sci-fi movies come even close to this level of badness.
Quality-wise it strongly reminds me of a series of Wonder Woman the-live-action-show episodes strung together. (Sure, you remember Shazam and Wonder Woman et al. on Saturday mornings...don't you?)  Combine this with Jack Palance, Alan Hale Jr. and Jim Backus (oh fie, how could you guys sink so low!), and we get two hours of pure misery, 70s style.
I feel for Mike and the bots, really I do.
I actually don't know if I can recommend this one: the movie is so bad nothing can save it, and I sincerely doubt I'll ever suffer through it again.  But... if you need a little pain in your life, this is a great way to get it.  Maybe rental would be a better option.",1009065600,4,1371,4.504032258064516
1199149,4,B00000DBSE,"One of the entertaining sub-genres of movies Joel, Mike, and The Bots had to suffer through was the cheap knock-offs of better known (and just *better*) films. These include 'Time of the Apes,' 'Agent from H.A.R.M.,' neither of which have been released on video so far as I know, and this one, 'Angels' Revenge.' Part of the humor is the dawning realization that the makers of this epic really were shameless enough to attempt such an obvious rip-off of a hit TV series. Even the title doesn't have the decency to clothe itself in obscurity.
From the clothes to the music to the hair to, well, everything, this film is as Seventies as the orange shag rug in your parents' den. Watching M&TB deal with that is just part of the fun, while the Mads get into the spirit by dressing as their favorite Seventies relief pitchers.
I'm not sure why Rhino chose the episodes they did when deciding which MST titles to release on video, though I imagine copyright questions had a lot to do with it. I don't consider 'Angels' Revenge' one of the standout episodes of Season 6, let alone of the whole series. But MST3K was always so entertaining, even a run-of-the-mill ep like this one is well worth the investment.",1006732800,,1203,4.6
1199150,5,B00000DBSE,"This shameful movie is one of the worst things ever filmed. The leading ladies' acting ability is , well, not very good. The plot (?) concerns a group of ladies who band together to keep kids off drugs. The way to do this? dress in Evil-Kenevil type outfits while driving a customised van, giving some of the worst acting performances this side of Baywatch. This movie will test your stanima, many did not make it through the film-watching experience alive. Mike and the 'bots are funny as heck though.",1000339200,,502,4.651685393258427
1199151,5,B00000DBSE,"Don't bother with Charlie's Angels for camp fun--go with the real thing.  Like Mitchell, this is another great bad movie from the 70's.  Stars at low points in their carreers, who couldn't get a gig on Love Boat at the time, wound up in this film.  Definitely some of the best commentary found in any MST3K episode!",1000166400,,315,4.491228070175438
1199152,5,B00000DBSE,"If I were to sum up ""Angel's Revenge"" in one word, that word would be ""Biohazard.""  This movie is so unbelievably horrid that it might actually be dangerous.  Few have seen this movie and lived to tell the tale.  So I'm going to tell you what to expect, so that no one else suffers the way I did.
As far from artistic filmmaking as you can get without including Adam Sandler in the mix, the film is little more than an excuse to show scantily clad women flopping their you-know-what's around in an excessive and obviously painful manner.  None of the seven female stars have any talent beyong striking poses and saying some of the worst dialogue this side of ""Batman & Robin.""  Sound's bad?  It gets worse.  One of them actually gets on stage in Las Vegas and sings a song that threatens to make the viewer's head explode.  It's called ""Shine your love"", and it consists entirely of dead-brain-walking up there singing ""Shine your love"" over and over and over and over for about six hours until you just want to put a shotgun in your mouth and pull the trigger.  You think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not.  I'll forever mourn the deaths of so many of my friends because of this movie.  It's like surviving a war, only more likely to cause permanent psychological damage.
Now, those seven women have teamed up to destroy the drug cartel owned by many name actors, such as Peter Lawford (who gets drunker and drunker as the minutes tick by) and Jack Palance (who has appeared in a few other mst3k movies as well).  Other stars that were tricked into making this fiasco are Jim Backus, Alan Hale Jr., Pat Buttram, and Arthur Godfrey, all of whom should be ashamed of themselves.
Naturally, Mike and the bots riff and rant like there's no tomorrow, asking the tough questions (who's not thrusting?) and tackling major political issues (we will, like, bury you).  They break the hilarity meter time and time again, even in the host skits (especially when crow tries to organize a seventies blaxploitation flick).  There's a lot of fun to be had on this tape; if you're a mistie like me, don't hesitate to buy it.  Enjoy.",994118400,,2113,4.56763925729443
1199153,4,B00000DBSE,"Sort of a cheapie Charlie's Angels with slightly downsized babes?  Yeah, that's it.  ANGELS ranks as a very good episode.  But according to Mike, Angels Revenge is simply ""the longest flashback ever"".  For babe power I put it slightly below season 10's HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND (Not yet available on video).  There's some truly classic riffs which may force you to stop the tape just to laugh at length.  There's one point where I thought to myself how Jim Backus looked like a walking corpse.  Shortly after this Crow says:  ""This is the first movie Jim Backus did...after he died.""  That was a tape-stopper for me!
Aaron Spelling on a bad day?  Yep, that's Angels Revenge!",989280000,2,674,4.732758620689655
1199154,5,B00000DBSE,"This made-for-TV-movie, Charlie's-Angels-parody, series pilot, contractual obligation tax write-off, call it what you will unleashes the full force of the '70s on Mike and the 'bots.  The plot ostensibly centers around a schoolteacher who recruits several women to attack Drug Lord Peter Lawford (in a quaalude and alcohol inspired performance) and his right-hand man Jack Palance.  Along the way a few washed-up TV ""stars"" are thrown in:  Alan ""Dhoo"" Hale Jr as a manager (""what could you possibly need from an Alan Hale Jr"" is Mike's comment), Pat Butrum as his annoying Green Acres character selling vans (hey it IS the '70s), and the one true talent Jim Backus as a militia commander (The MST3K crew are actually sympathetic to Backus'.  There's plenty of nauseating performances left here to riff on.) Ostensibly that's the plot:  the REAL plot is to have seven braless women run around as much as possible in various jumpsuits and bikinis.  Mike's comment, ""This movie offends one cell animals"" sums it up nicely. The '70s beg to be riffed, and the timeframe combined with an INCREDIBLY badly-acted movie make for one of the best MST3ks done during Mike Nelson's reign. If you lived through the 70s, like I did, the hair and clothes will start you laughing.  If you didn't, well, yes people really did dress like that-unselfconsciously.  It's a hoot, pick it up. NB:  At least one of the actresses managed to salvage her career after this disaster Lieu Chinh-""she's the Asian one in our group"" later appeared in the Joy-Luck Club.",978652800,7,1536,4.945525291828794
1199155,5,B00000DBSE,"This has to be the best episode of MST3K ever!  I've watched over 20 times and it never gets old.  The quest stars in this one are great, Pat Buttram springs immediately to mind here.  And the riffs that Mike and the bots come up with are absolutely hilarious like: ""Those were big dogs"" and ""Um, I'd like a drug please"" and also the songs they come up with while there are close-ups of Jack Palance keep me and my friends in stitches everytime we watch it.",970531200,,457,4.2298850574712645

In this episode (#622) we see Mike & the bots  watch Angels Revenge. The plot of this is that a teacher decides to take  out a drug lord's operations. This movie is like a bad 90 minute episode of  Charlie's Angels. Mike & the bots make some great riffs in this  episode, and the movie is so bad that it's fun to watch. It's just great!

It's like a having a 70's themed nightmare strongly influenced by Gilligan's Island and Charlie's Angels screen test outtakes.

The production reminds me of the concept behind ""Bowfinger."" I picture the recognizable actors as either desperate, bound by contract, paying back a huge favor or they were cleverly tricked into being in the film.

""Seriously, Jack (Palance), this is a golden opportunity. Peter Lawford and Jim Backus are in.""",1319155200,,632,5.106796116504855
7905878,5,B00000DBSE,"This is the first MST3K episode I ever watched.  Much love to Gilligan's Island refugees Alan Hale & Jim Backus for their embarrassing performances.

This movie has it all: action, ladies and lameness.  It's like someone fused the A-Team with Charlie's Angel's and then accidentally dropped some Hogan's Heroes into the mix.  This film is great b/c is isn't boring, but it isn't engaging either, it gets just enough of your attention to tune your brain in for the oncoming riff-attack.

The skit with the mads turning Mike and crew into the cast of Renegade is hilarious and just seeing the two diabolical fiends dressed at 70's relief pitchers/tennis pros is enough to put you on the floor.

Great episode all around!",1235347200,,718,4.844262295081967
7905879,5,B00000DBSE,"I've had this episode a while and delayed watching it because the title/theme seemed so unappealing.  I was pleasantly surprised (in a funny bad movie sort of way). This shameless rip-off on the 70's ""Charlies Angels"" series is one of funniest Mystery Science Theater films I've seen.  It pretty much embodies everything wrong with Hollywood and to some extent with ""the 70's"".

The film is remarkable in that it is absolutely horrible, but (unlike some MST3K source material)it actually has real recognizable famous actors in it . . . Jack Palance, Alan Hale Jr (Gilligan's ""Skipper""), Peter Lawford, the ""Mr Haney"" player from Green Acres, Jim Backkus. With the exception of the menacing Jack Palance, they turn in humiliating performances (well. . . I guess Alan Hale Jr was OK, but he just basically acted like ""The Skipper"" wearing a business suit).  Peter Lawford was noticeably slurring his speech.  I dare say that Jim Backkus would never want to show his face in public again after his performance as a right wing militant wearing what amounted to a marching band uniform.  What the ----?  ""Mr Haney"" looks like he had his makeup done at a funeral home and THEY DID A BAD JOB.

The plot is basically that these half dozen ""hotties"" (that can't act) come together as a team to battle drug dealers.  I needn't go into any more plot detail because I assure you it is irrelevant and ridiculous.  I suppose a couple of them are rather hot, but most were marginally unattractive (maybe it was a 70's thing).  In fact, I think Mike & The Bots missed a chance to compare the tall lanky (I'm talking 6'3"", 120lbs) black chick with the ridiculous hair, to Chuck Berry (sorry Chuck, I actually like you, but you weren't playing a hot black chick).  The lead blond was actually pretty attractive, but could not act (none of them could).  In one scene where she is walking she actually looks down at her chest to see that she is ""jiggling"" adequately.

Everything is cheesy and over the top -- their ""uniforms"", the drug dealers, all dialogue, their van and motorcycle, . . . everything.  The film is so bad that it would stand alone as an entertaining experience.  Add the Mystery Science Theater treatment, and this was very, very funny.  This was a Mike Nelson effort (no offense Joel fans, Joel is a very nice guy, but I think Mike is funnier) and he and the Bots were right on in this one.  I haven't done the math on ages, but somebody in the MST writing team was old enough to accurately squeeze the putrid essence of the 70's out and include it appropriately into the zinging.  Great work.

This is a highly recommended MST3K product - a must see in my opinion.",1192492800,,2665,4.6059322033898304
7905880,4,B00000DBSE,"Bad songs,bad clothes,and big hair,plenty of stuff to riff on.

I love this episode!",1164672000,,84,5.0
7905881,4,B00000DBSE,"One line that Elaine (Robin Greer) had was, ""It's a nice idea, but it's not a plan.""  That basically summed up the movie.  Yeah, it's a nice idea to work to stop the curse of drug addiciton.  But that doesn't automatically mean that it's a good plan to make a movie about stopping drug addiction.

Angel's Revenge has a lot of problems.  It had huge and glaring plot holes.  What little plot there was seemed to center around showcasing certain parts of the female anatomy.  It has cheesy acting.  It had Peter Lawford - who by then was so drunk and stoned all the time that he'd do anything for money to buy more drugs and booze.  It had Jack Palance, who in other roles is a fine actor, but not in this case.  It had men such as Jim Backus, Arthur Godfrey, Pat Buttram, and Alan Hale Jr degrading themselves for all to see.  Were these guys that desperate for money?

Without Mystery Science Theater 3000, Angels Revenge would be unwatchable.  I don't think I could watch a minute of this movie without Mike and the 'bots around to give the film the tearing down it so richly deserved.",1126051200,,1087,4.375
7905882,1,B00000DBSE,"I'm a diehard fanatic to the cause of our robot friends.  I recently got some of the 4-pack MST3K collectors series DVD's, cause I wanted to dare view movies not known to me.
  I kind of fell in love with Pod People, and I was slightly offended by the 'bots trashing of Trumpy.  Cave Dwellers got the roasting it deserved and Crow's song of Ator's Kite made of string, aluminum and bamboo is a hoot.  Shorts #1 is what I wanted to do as a kid with those damn school movies I had to suffer through, if I could have done that then.
I'm a conneseur of bad movies, using John Waters' ""Pink Flamingos"" as the standard to judge all other bad movies by.  But Dorothy, there are worse movies in Oz!
Angel's Revenge?  I thought I got ripped off!  ""God, they were putting on a Jiggle movie to tittilate teenage boys on the Sattelite of Love!""  I thought that was real low of the MST gang.  But  I endured and watched that pig!  I groaned through it.  It was truly bad.
THen I dared to watch it a second time.  That was my doom!  And  I was enlightened on the wisdom of the MST gang.
I have read all the bad reviews on Manos the Hands of Fate on both here at Amazon and the IMDB, and I laughed, thinking on how a celluloid loop put such folks into suicide mode?  It sounds funny to me.  Yet its funny how the brain goes into protective mode, conveniently forgetting such absolute tripe like Angels Revenge!
Only robots could endure that movie long enough to give it the proper ""Respect"" it needed by throwing cockroaches into it's coffin before burial!
SPOILERS!
It is a film where all the has-beens on earth went to twitch and go through their death throes!  It is truly tragic!
Old farts whom a case of Viagra coundn't help them!
Arthur Godfrey!  For Christ's sake, Arthur Godfrey!  Just to see him with that brown rug on his head, him cackling all over with witch's fingers twitching to ""Shine his Love"" on the b--bs of that Vegas singer!  And  I thought that man once had dignity!  Crow gave him the thrashing he deserved by imitating his cancerous wheezing lust cackle!  Just thank God that Chesterfields took that old troll from us!
Alan Hale!  I can never again stomach another episode of Gilligan's Island after seeing him in this brain punishment! For him to think that he in his tons of suet could chummy up with all the brainless bimbos is such a travesty on the once great comedian and charactor actor.  ""Gilligan? Guess who's had it?""  YOU, you has-been!  OH THE HUMANITY!
Jim Baccus!  He was so good in ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", and he was in the class of Jonathan Harris'Dr. Smith in Lost in Space, playing the Millionaire on Gilligan's Island.  Seeing him in that Music Man band outfit in Angel's Revenge proved to me how alcohol can ruin a once-fine actor!
Actors should at least have dignity!  Even though Divine ate dog doo in ""Pink Flamingos,"" at least SHe had the dignity to have grace and class in ""Hairspray"" before SHe died!  Richard Burton's Swan Song was his greatest achievement in Radford's adaption of 1984.  Even Ronald Reagan had a certain class before he became a vegetable!
Some might say that Angels Revenge exploits women. I say that Angels Revenge exploited a bunch of has-been old geezers, robbing them of any semblance of self respect before they croaked!
Move over, Manos!  Move over Torga!  Even creep over, you shaggy carpet monster in ""The Creeping Terror!""  There is something more horrible than you! There is something more terrible than the monster in the closet in ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die!""  At least, all these characters were fictitious! Not flesh-and-blood once-greats who degrade themselves into barf-bags in Angels Revenge!",1062115200,2,3674,4.552671755725191
7905883,5,B00000DBSE,"This is one of the funniest MST3K episodes of all time.  I hardly even know where to begin on this one.  Here's the background: a teacher is so disgusted with bad guys selling drugs to kids that she decides to blow up the drug lab outside of town (where she seems to think all of the world's drugs are centrally processed).  She recruits a supposedly famous singer best known for shining, shining, shining, shining, shining her love, then shining it some more; a stunt woman; a cop; a model; and a female martial arts expert to help her carry out the job.  It's a whole lot like Charlie's Angels, only these angels are much less attractive and more annoying.
The most amazing thing about Angels Revenge is the cast.  Never have so many familiar names humiliated themselves so thoroughly in the same film.  First we have Arthur Godfrey playing himself; watching him engage in excited antics at a Vegas concert is pretty pitiful, really.  Then we have Alan Hale (aka Skipper) who plays--once she finally stops shining her love--our singer's manager; the Skipper has just one little scene and luckily escapes without too much damage.  The same cannot be said for his fellow castaway Jim Backus.  Backus plays the incompetent leader of a ragtag band of right-wing revolutionaries calling themselves the American Right; his performance is truly painful to watch--really; I'm not just saying it for effect.  Then we have Pat Buttram, Mr. Haney from Green Acres, selling used cars--his scene can be watched without too much discomfort.  Another notable player is Peter Lawford; I didn't like the guy in his prime, and I certainly don't like to see him going around without a shirt on in his later years.  Lawford apparently survived this acting ordeal by staying completely drunk throughout shooting, slurring his lines rather obviously.  Rounding out the list of notable actors is Jack Palance, who plays the middleman in between the pushers on the streets and Mr. Big; he's actually not half bad, but the movie is so awful it's hard to notice.  Perhaps my favorite thing is Crow's impersonation of Palance singing the Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song each time we see Palance driving a car.
Mike and the Bots had me laughing from start to finish on this one.  Crow is especially biting in his comments, referring to the film as The T&A Team.  When we watch a woman climb a ladder, he complains that the movie is giving away the plot, then he quickly gives in and announces his intention to just look at the breasts--that's really what this movie is about, when you get right down to it.  The sexploitation factor here exceeds even the blaxploitation factor to be found in the script for Crow's new film project titled Chocolate Jones and the Temple of Funk.
Thrill to the intense drama of the protagonist searching frantically for the very important map she keeps in a safe place in her pocketbook; she's knows it's in there; oooh; it's very important; ooooooh; she knows she put it in there; oooooooh; there it is.  Watch thrusting women kidnap, torture, and kill men without losing their happy-go-lucky demeanors or even breaking a nail.  Watch manly men like Jack Palance stand around immobile so that a group of naturally endowed women can easily subdue them.  Watch a school teacher share moments of torture treatment with one of her young students while another woman teaches the youngster how to shoot a gun.  Yes, Angels Revenge is all of this and more.  Oddly, I have to admit that I rather liked the movie itself; sure it's incredibly silly, shallow, degrading, and sometimes downright painful to watch, but at least the story keeps moving along at a good pace from start to finish, unlike many of the awful movies taken from the vaults of Deep Thirteen.  This movie actually makes fun of itself; when you add in Mike, Tom, and Crow performing at the top of their game, you get 90 minutes of utter hilarity.  You'll laugh; you'll cry; you'll ask why this awful movie was ever made--then you'll look up and remember 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, even 12 reasons..",1031011200,11,4053,4.748930099857347
7905884,5,B00000DBSE,"Oh, this movie was painful. When you have six women running around trying to stop a drug cartel with about 4 brain cells between them about the only thing you can think is how could any human get through this.
Well that's what those three little talking shadows are there for. Mike and the 'bots are really up on their game on this one. From the odd conceptual song about shining your love to the high schooler who just ""sticks"" to the back of Jacks car the riffing is greatly up to par.
If you are looking for a good Mike episode that has been released by Rhino then I recommend Angels Revenge to add to your collection.

7905886,5,B00000DBSE,"The MST3K gang has a field day with this buried treasure of a movie. The titular angels aren't famous, but the movie ""Angels Revenge"" has more stars in it than the big dipper! Arthur Godfrey plays himself, lusting after the blonde angel who is a disco singer in Vegas. Arthur goes backstage after her act and assures her that she'll go on to be a superstar in show business.  With the hot disco song ""Shine Your Love"" and Alan Hale, Jr. (the Skipper on Gilligan's Island) as her manager, how can she miss? Somehow, she does!  Pat Buttram (Mr. Haney from Green Acres) makes a cameo appearance later as a fast talking car salesman who sells the angels a van. He doesn't look like he's wearing makeup, he looks like he's embalmed! However, the One Foot In The Grave Award goes to Jim Backus (Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island). He plays the leader of a heavily armed militia group. Jim's big scene is when the Asian angel karate chops him while he's holding a big pot of spaghetti.  He ends up wearing most of the spaghetti on his head. The look on his face inspires pity, not laughter. Peter Lawford plays the head druglord who constantly talks of how control is the key to his power. Unfortunately, he is totally out of control. He's so wasted that he doesn't speak his lines, he slurs them! Jack Palance acts as his right hand man. My favorite scene with him involves a local drug pusher who Jack suspects has ripped him off.  ""I just want to talk to you"" he keeps shouting, chasing after him with a gun in his hand.  They run down alleys and up to a rooftop. The poor pusher is so scared he keeps backing away from Jack until he falls off the roof. Jack Palance was the only star to survive this movie and go on to have a career. All the others watched this film and died of embarrassment!",1018483200,,1788,4.357357357357357
