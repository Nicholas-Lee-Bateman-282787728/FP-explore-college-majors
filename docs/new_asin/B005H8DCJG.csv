8472753,5,B005H8DCJG,"I really enjoyed this Korean drama! The first episode is serious and dramatic. Then the series kind of swerves back and forth between romance, revenge and comedy. The ending is very intense and I felt kind of shaky afterwards. Lee Min Ho is a good actor and enjoyable to watch. He drives a number of cool cars in this drama and has an interesting wardrobe.",1331683200,,356,4.492307692307692

8472755,5,B005H8DCJG,"This is my favorite Korean drama of all time!!  I love all the action scenes and the romance. The characters really come to life and I find myself cheering for the good guys and when one of them gets hurt it makes me cry lol. That's good acting if you ask me! If you aren't really into dramas you will like this show, it's a drama, but there is enough action to make it really interesting!",1321920000,2,389,4.118421052631579
8472756,5,B005H8DCJG,"I LOVED this show.  Lee Min Ho is a wonderful actor.  I liked that it wasn't just the same formula episode after episode and the characters changed and progressed.  The ending was a little bit week.  But I was hooked on this show from start to finish and even had to watch it a few times in a row which is very rare for me!

The subtitles aren't that great, in fact the last 2 episodes were gibberish and I had to watch them online.  But I can't take any stars away from a wonderful show for those technicalities.

I can't wait to see what Lee Min Ho is up to next!",1320796800,2,565,3.9910714285714284
8472757,5,B005H8DCJG,"I watched part of this show on T.V. but lost track, when I bought it I was worried about the quality of the subtitles since other shows that I have bought have claimed to have great English subs and then been terrible.  However with this show it was not the case.  The subtitles were amazing from the start of the show to the end.  And of course the plot itself was absolutely enthralling.  I found myself spending hours watching episode after episode I could not seem to turn it off.  If you love a story with a splash of humor, a pinch of romance, a twist of conspiracy, and a heap of action then this is the perfect show for you.  The acting was wonderful and the plot complex, but not so complex as to make understanding the story unclear.  There are literally moments where you hold your breath waiting to see what will happen next, and others where you just want to cheer the lead characters on.  By far this has to be one of my new all time favorite stories (shows).",1319760000,4,973,4.278688524590164
8472758,5,B005H8DCJG,"I've seen many Korean dramas, but ""City Hunter"" is the best hands down!  The action (awesome moves by Lee Min Ho), the drama, the acting (by the whole cast), the directing and the story... WOW!  I even got my husband hooked on it, and he's very critical.

I have to disagree with the previous review with regards to the ending.  It was clear to me how it ended, and it leaves it open for a possible ""City Hunter 2"".  Sadly, however, Lee Min Ho doesn't want to do another season.  And, per the director, if Lee Min Ho doesn't want to do another one, then there won't be a City Hunter 2.  I can only hope Lee Min Ho will change his mind later on.  There is a possibility.

Love this drama!  I'm so glad I bought the dvd set, so I can watch it again.",1318982400,6,747,4.054794520547945
