6684154,4,B00NX4NMSC,Love Saxon. Great video,1421107200,,23,5.0
6684155,1,B00NX4NMSC,the live concerts are cool but the documentary was very boring.  I'll be honest what has always turned me off about saxon is the fact that they think they're in league with bands like Def Leppard and maiden..when they are clearly several leagues  below them..critically and sales wise. and they basically admitted everything They've done since their first few albums are gArbage....you don't see the classic bands saying that about their music...they stand up for it and are proud of it..and for the record I'll be the first person to say that I'm not a huge saxon fan but I do really enjoy their mid 80s material and to hear them put that stuff down is a real slap in The face. my favorite albums from Saxon are Crusader through destiny... I spent about a hundred bucks on these import CDs and it's great to know that the authors of this material are so ashamed of it. please guys just retire already,1421020800,,901,4.555555555555555
6684156,5,B00NX4NMSC,Good DVD if you like Saxon you know what to expect,1419638400,,50,3.6363636363636362
6684157,5,B00NX4NMSC,"Excellent documentary. Very good video and sound on concert blue rays. Good for both die hard and new fans alike.
I might be a little bias, because I've been listening to Saxon since early eighties and they've always fascinated me as one of the best (if not the best) NWOBHM bands in the world! I'm still surprised they don't have very good exposure here in the USA. I've seen them a few times here in Chicago area and it is always some small venues with fairly small audiences. They still give an amazing performance! Heavy riffs, pounding drums, booming bass, twin guitar assault and Biff's strong voice leave you wanting more every time! Absolutely amazing.
I think I have every album and every video of the band ever produced. And I will get my hands on anything with Saxon name on it. That's how good they are!",1418688000,6,815,4.551020408163265

8680905,3,B00NX4NMSC,"3 stars max from a big Saxon fan. Why? Sound....Actually, the Wacken show isn't too bad, but the other two sound like they are straight off the mixing board and it wasn't mixed very well. Nibbs's mike was too loud and he really doesn't sing well on the backing vocals. Also, on the non-Wacken shows, the guitar solos weren't very good. Not sure if the cold was getting to their fingers or what.

I haven't watched the documentary yet because I bought it for the concerts. BTW, once again Amazon is wrong, this is a region free disc.",1481328000,,532,4.428571428571429

8680911,1,B00NX4NMSC,"I've been a Saxon fan since 1980. This dvd / cd looks good on paper or whatever, but, it's a real disappointment. It was really hard to get it to play on my computer and when I finally got it to open and play, it wasn't really worth the effort. Poor sound quality, real bootleg stuff and a really tinny live cd. What a let down!",1424649600,,328,3.984848484848485
8680912,5,B00NX4NMSC,"Great band, great DVD. Love the concert footage also.  Worth it just for the HD concerts footage alone.",1422835200,,103,4.722222222222222
