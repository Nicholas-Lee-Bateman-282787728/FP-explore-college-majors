8174695,5,B000N4B8PE,"I bought this video many years ago and enjoyed it immensely. In fact I recall buying several more copies and giving them as gifts to friends.
It shows old original video and photos taken when the technology of movie taking was pretty rudimentary. It tells the story of adventurers and their exploits, shows photos of the boats they tried to make work, the wrecks, the successes and failures, and tells of the competition to be the first... the fastest... and eventually the race to take tourists through the canyon. It highlights the death defying adventures of early river rafters. Humorous, historic, delightful.",1316995200,,614,5.029411764705882
