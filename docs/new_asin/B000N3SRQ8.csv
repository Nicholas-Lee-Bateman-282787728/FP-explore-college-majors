2754500,2,B000N3SRQ8,Lots Of Funny Scenes Including a Death scene. But Food Don't Mix With Sex Scenes Unless Your Into That Fetish. Good Quality. Great Sound. Fair Acting. All And All Fair Sleazy Of A Flick.,1313539200,,186,4.5
2754501,2,B000N3SRQ8,"""Julia"" starts off with the typical train ride across Switzerland and
dad's young girlfriend, Evan, getting it off in the toilet.

When Patrick is having lunch his discusting, piggist and mad aunts
and uncles, his uncle Mr Loveday reminded me of a pig, in eating and
behaviour.

I must admit it is the first time I've seen someone of his porkish
condition (or any condition for that matter) playing the piano with
with his [...]. It would be an experience to see him play at Carnegie
Hall.

The highlight was seeing his relatives playing a tennis match, although
very short, it was one of best parts of the film.

A trip to Verona with dad, Evan and Julia was mundane for Patrick
until dad beat him to Julia, but that evening aunt Evan visited him
in his room and poor Patrick had to learn the facts of life from her,
although I'm afraid it didn't work out the way she wanted it to.
Over breakfast in bed the next morning, a wonderous thing happened,
While Evan was trying to find the dropped salt shaker she found
out that it wasn't the salt shaker that was shaking.

A rainy tennis match between Patrick and Julia was boring as it was
cut up with scenes from uncle Loveday playing the piano in the rain
and Patrick's relatives in the house fighting, which is a shame, as
the match ended in a love match of the best kind.

I enjoyed ""Julia"" because I like Sylvia Kristel, but in the same
vain I was disappointed as it reminded me of another Swiss movie
""Private Passions"" with Sybill Danning, which I've had on VHS for
years and now own on dvd as well.

Over all this isn't a bad movie, and I give it 2 1/2 stars.",1295913600,5,1614,4.324503311258278
2754502,1,B000N3SRQ8,"I was very disapionted that Sylvia Kristel did not wear

the style of Stockings & Garter Belt that she wore in both Emauelle &

Private Lessions.

  Also This Movie Julia was also not as exciting & Erotic as both

Emanuelle & Private Lessions.

So to all Sylvia Kristel Fans you skip this Boring piece.",1181001600,7,302,4.481481481481482
2754506,3,B000N3SRQ8,weak plot and the was acting okay but not great by anyone. A French film that lacks emotion and a good story line. Not really worth buying or renting,1378339200,2,149,4.172413793103448

2754508,3,B000N3SRQ8,Amusing but not that entertaining. The real focus of the movie seems to be on her boyfriends step mother not Julia.,1370390400,,115,4.523809523809524
2754509,3,B000N3SRQ8,"The movie seems to follow the formula typical of many porn or soft-porn movies, which is to say manage to get the actors into as many combinations as possible (he-she, she-he, she-she, old+young, young+old, etc.) If that's all you're looking for, its okay I guess; the plot was pretty thin, and the characters more like caricatures.  A few things even seemed kind of gross (the significantly overweight composer running around naked, the scene in which one woman is virtually shoveling whipped cream into & onto the other - definitely the opposite of romantic!)  Also seemed pretty dated (1970's era.)  But the movie was free with Amazon Prime, so I guess you get what you pay for.",1367539200,5,681,4.853448275862069

2754513,1,B000N3SRQ8,This is a review of the DVD.  It is possible (but unlikely) that the on-line version is better.  I am sure the movie was a great movie when it was made and still would be BUT they cut out all the things that make a Sylvia Kristel movie interesting.  It should be rated PG.,1350000000,3,272,4.0
2754514,1,B000N3SRQ8,"Stupid story line, poor photography and bad acting. Supposed to be erotica but really misses the mark badly. There is not ones redeeming quality to this film.
