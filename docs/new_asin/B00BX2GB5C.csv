8574928,5,B00BX2GB5C,"Lauren is a gentle inspiration, giving confidence and instructions throughout the exercise program.  I was looking for something just like this and came upon her video.  I've been doing it for 2 weeks and it is getting easy and I'm feeling stronger.  I retired a couple of years ago and noticed that movements I took for granted not long ago were becoming difficult.  Her wonderful demeanor and program are helping me change that.  Thanks Lauren",1521331200,,445,4.88
