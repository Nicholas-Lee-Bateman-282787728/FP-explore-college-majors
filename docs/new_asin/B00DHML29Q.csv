5813106,4,B00DHML29Q,"This is not really a vinyasa/kundalini mix, although his vinyasa has small flavors of kundalini moves in it.  It is rather one hatha vinyasa workout and one kundalini -- both very different. For people who are wondering if this is worth checking out as an addition to Raviana and Maya, I'd say yes, give it a try. It's got enough different twists (no pun intended?) on the usual moves to make it feel fresh and not a duplicate, and Tommy is a really enjoyable teacher. It really doesn't matter if you are not in recovery.  As one reviewer says, we're all in recovery for something, and it is really NOT pervasive. It's mentioned in his talks and at beginning and ends of workouts.  You will not feel like the dvd is not for you if you're not in recovery, unlike some themed dvds.

This is billed as 3 workouts. I think that's a bit misleading. I'd call it 2 workouts with a 6 minute extra.  The 6 minutes is a Serabandasana kriya, where Tommy does updog, chatturanga, downdog over and over for 6 minutes and that's it. This workout illustrates my one big gripe with Tommy -- his seeming lack of understanding that not everyone comes to him with amazing upper and lower body strength. He says ""anybody can do this,"" and says you just may need to do fewer reps at first.  A great many people cannot do even one rep of this at all, they will just collapse, without skipping or severely limiting the very deep chattaranga pushup he instructs and just alternating the up and down dog position.  He never mentions this nor does he give any modification. Similarly in his hatha workout, a great deal of time in the beginning is spent with feet in crescent pose -- very hard but no acknowledgement of that or modifications.

The vinyasa workout is VERY vinyasa --- meaning he loves doing half salutes and/or the updog/downdog vinyasa between every pose thing.  Alot of standard standing poses, repeated warrior 1's.  For me, it gets more enjoyable when he moves to the ground.

As for the kundalini- Start with ong namo guru dev namo. Then cat cow. Then cat cow with alternating legs raised and brought to nose. Alot. Just not one of my favorite moves.  I know he's doing a specific kriya, so probably not fair to fault him, but I can't help thinking ""Again, Tommy, with the strenuousness and the dread factor?""  Then sit in rock pose, hugging arms move from side to side. Then twist side to side arms up. Spinal flex in rock pose. Stand up and repeatedly bend forward and touch ground.  Bend and put hands to floor and keep there a while.  Sit with legs spread, grab toes, bend side to side alternating, then bend forward.  Cobblers pose, pump knees up and down.  Bridge series.  Lie on back, bicycle legs.  Spinal rolls.  Cobra with breath of fire.  Cobra turn and look side to side over each shoulder. Lay on stomach.  Childs pose.  Arm stretch in childs pose with long deep breathing. Sit crosslegged. Rotate torso --different from the sufi grind in maya and raviana dvds, here you're just circling the torso itself, sitting erect.  Sit crosslegged and grasp hands and raise arms up and down. Shoulder shrugs, neck rolls. Rock pose, pump hands up and down.  Grasp hands palms up above head in rock pose, breath of fire -- a little different from sat kriya.  Sit cross legged, breath, savasana, stretch, sit cross legged. Here Tommy just says sat nam and bows, you don't chant it. There is a lot of resting in savasana between poses.",1400803200,18,3428,4.569558101472995
5813107,5,B00DHML29Q,"Tommy Rosen is an amazing soul- He is very articulate, patient and calming. I would recommend any of his instructional guides. The yoga isn't for a beginner like me but I love the intro to breathing which we all need! You will be amazed at how shallow we breathe.. you will feel very calm and relaxed after going through these exercises with Tommy.

5813108,5,B00DHML29Q,"First off, do not let the ""yoga for addiction"" prevent you from buying this dvd.  One does not have to be in recovery to benefit from this series.  That being said,  we are all addicted to something ( food, wine, coffee, internet) so why not have tools to assist us in letting go of what doesn't serve us?  This particular dvd offers 3 yoga sets and 4 meditations.  Yoga sets:  ""Twisting the Issues out of your Tissues""  vinyasa yoga 39 min.,  ""Kriya for Morning Sadhana"" kundalini yoga 57:30 min.,  ""Serabandanda Kriya"" yogi push-up practice 6 min.  Meditations: ""Intro to Breathwork"" 14 min.,  ""Calm Heart Meditation"" 6:30 min.,  ""Sitali Breath Meditation"" 5 min., ""Sodarshan Chakra Kriya"" 7:30 min.  Tommy Rosen is down-to-earth and offers clear and concise instructions.  The practices are challenging and enjoyable.  I love the blending of Kundalini and Vinyasa.  The setting and music are both lovely.  I highly recommend this dvd!",1382227200,,937,5.019607843137255
5813109,5,B00DHML29Q,"If anyone had told me that I would be getting into yoga at my age (52) at my weight (not disclosing!)  ... I would have told them they were crazy.  But, I found myself wanting to experience positive change in my life and the signs just kept saying ""try yoga.""  I'd heard of Tommy Rosen through Mastin Kipp of the Daily Love and so I figured I'd try this DVD in the comfort and security of my home ... where no one could watch me fumble.  What started out as a whim has now become a part of my life, and I'm so happy to have Tommy Rosen teaching me in his calm, serene, supportive, and inspiring way.  This DVD is awesome.  The yoga programs are challenging and yet do-able ... and the ""extras"" on the DVD are powerful, too.  If you're on the fence about this, I'm telling you now -- take the leap and get this DVD.  I'm sure you'll find that it will be one of the best purchases you make this year.  And... oh yeah ... don't just buy it and hope you'll do the yoga ... actually do it.  It'll make all the difference in your life.  I'm living proof of that!",1376265600,20,1056,4.053140096618358
5813110,5,B00DHML29Q,"I've had one of the toughest years of my life. I saw Tommy in Sun Valley, Idaho this last year and bought one of his DVD's at the festival. This is my first time trying yoga and I love it! His technique, coaching, and real life attitude make it feel totally approachable. I'm so happy I got started with this video. I've shared it with everyone I know - even those not in recovery or going through addiction. I just think it's awesome!",1375920000,10,435,4.253012048192771
