503090,5,6302746590,"I'm a little biased on this one. I actually worked on this production from Jim Henson Productions. After a week of shooting, the songs and characters were forever burned into my brain. That's not a bad thing though. This is a wonderful example of the Muppet performers work. The characters are different than any other Muppets release as are the songs. I'm not sure what inspired these new characters or why they never made a re-appearance, but if your children enjoy the Muppets or puppets, this tape should be sought after. If your a fan of the Muppets and think you've seen it all, this is a little bit of an obscure one. Seek it out and enjoy it!",1184630400,,650,4.470588235294118
503091,5,6302746590,"I picked this up in the local movie store for $9.99.  Being a fan of Bing Rhames and remembering Jim Brown's part in Mars Attacks way back when I thought I would give it a try.  Ving Rhames wrote the story keep this in mind.  The Story is literally about James (Ving Rhames) and his mistakes which lead him to prison leaving behind his son 12 years old and his wife.  Inside James is shown off as an animal to local inmates.  He and chosen inmates have brauls for money.  And they end with James killing them with sick smiles of delight.. Any way James meets another local inamte after a recent scuffle, Jim Brown.... Jim plays a Revolutionist who believes in this speech which a slave holder Lynch gave to other slave holders in order of keeping their slaves orginazed and in order.  Turn the black against the black. Light skin , against dark skin, old vs young, women vs men. etc.  So he trys to explain to James that this is because of this slaveholder that they (the black people) have been trapped in fighting amongst themselves for all of these generations.  Jim Brown is in hopes of rehibilitating James for a new cleaner life on the outside..

James makes it on the outside and soon sees that he and his son are not connecting.  His son is the same person he used to be, but he does not want to be that same person, nor does he want his son following in his footsteps.  From then on it is a battle of who will convince the other to change their style of living..

I will not spoil anything in fact have left out a lot of stuff because it is that good that you have to watch..",1171152000,5,1584,4.24
503092,5,6302746590,"I live in the inner city, and am sometimes uncomfortable with what I see our youths values has become.  Common curiosities, values, graciousness and morals seem to be a thing of the past.  Family values are non existent, family is non existent, children are left to raise themselves, and their lessons on life values have now become street smarts. This movie ""Animal"" reaches all the impurities that we see in today's society.  Hopefully one day the cycle will break.",1144108800,5,467,4.886075949367089
503093,2,6302746590,"Let me start out by saying that this movie had me locked all the way through. I was never bored and I thought the performances were well done. But the thing that made the movie a four star movie for me AT FIRST was the Willie Lynch lesson I got from it. Being an African American (by the way, how come we're the only Americans required to state our mother land before American. But anyway) I felt something bitter inside of me stirring at the thought of some master plan laid out long ago to control my community. But of course once the movie was over I did some research. It didn't take long for the movie to drop down to two stars... better yet, MAKE THAT ONE STAR, VING! For those of you looking to blame some stupid white guy for the current plight of the black community, I got some bad news for ya... WILLIE LYNCH NEVER EXISTED AND NEITHER DID HIS LETTERS UNTIL THE EARLY 1990's and only on the internet! Shame on you, Ving, for such an obvious lack of effort seperating historical fact from urban legend. Black people, you can go on back to fighting each other now. We'll just have to figure out why later. Maybe when one of the other races of the world figure out why they fight with each other, perhaps we can learn from them.",1129420800,,1235,4.259574468085106
503094,4,6302746590,"It is true that this is an of-told tale regarding the evils of life in the ""hood"", but, it is another interesting interpretation of the ghetto plite.  This one is based on the Willie Lynch papers that gave slave owners a program for controlling slaves that many people believe is the foundatiion for the self hatred and destruction that exists today in those communities.  It is also about the relationship between fathers and sons, literal and figurative, that perpetuate self destruction.  The acting is impeccable, especially Terrance Howard as the adult son, a man-child still searching for his father's love and approval.  Despite the previous review, this is a very worthwhile movie.",1128902400,5,689,5.125
503095,1,6302746590,"Once again, here comes another stinker starring Terrance Howard. Was he behind on the mortgage or what? Terrance Howard and Ving Rhames are too talented for this. The thug gone straight routine is getting kind of monotonous. Why can't writers come up with something more original. With the downright horrible storyline and camcorder-like film, no wonder this mess went straight to DVD!!",1128124800,3,386,5.241935483870968
503096,5,6302746590,"I first saw this video about 9 years ago when my mother was a nanny for a little boy who watched it incessantly.  I recently saw something that reminded me of it and wanted to find it for my 2 year old.  Needless to say, it wasn't an easy task.  I did finally find it in the amazon.com marketplace and purchased it.  It was everything I remembered with the fun songs and the hilarious characters.  These are songs you don't mind having stuck in your head for a day or two and my 2 year old loves it too.
I recommend this for anyone who has a child who likes music and dancing and singing.  They'll love it.",1068940800,2,606,4.093220338983051

503195,5,6302746590,"Yes, it's true Animal feels like a slightly low budget action film with some cheesy dialogue occupying the majority of the storyline, but for the most part, I'm impressed with the characters, the suspense, the action, and of course, the storytelling.

A father commits a crime and has to go away to jail.  When he's finally released several years later, lots of things have changed by that point involving his family, and specifically his younger son who had to grow up without a father.

Well when the father finally returns home, everything seems fine at first, but eventually family issues come into the picture and everything goes wrong from there.  I don't want to spoil the things that happen though, since that would spoil the storyline for you, the readers.

Anyway, the actual ""animal"" segments (the parts where the father plays a vicious fighter in jail who isn't afraid of anyone) wasn't utilized enough to give the movie its name in my opinion, so in that small respect, the storyline has some disappointing segments.

Also, Animal isn't straight-up action packed- instead, there's plenty of storyline building slowly and interestingly to the action segments, which actually helps us appreciate the violent scenes when they finally occur that much more.

Still, the focal point should be what occurs as soon as the father is released, and of course the very beginning of the film when you see why the father is in jail to begin with.

I have a soft spot for movies like these- whatever people think of the storytelling and the acting skills involving all the characters (I personally am not bothered in the least by either of these) the fact remains I remained interested in Animal from beginning to end, so that's why I feel like it deserves 5 stars.",1278460800,,1763,4.833887043189368

503197,3,6302746590,"The movie ""Animal"" was not a bad movie I would say, but it was not as good as I was expecting. I would grade it 2 (half way) in a scale of 5. In ""MY OPINION"", I would say that the rating of this movie would probably depend on someone's age, social background, life experiences, knowledge or level of education and IQ among other factors. I am sure that other people may rate this movie higher than I. My general rating would be equal to saying ""it was OK"" but that's all. The plot itself and the details of the movie had too many glitches for me to rate it better than just OK.",1264809600,,577,4.0701754385964914
