5339627,5,B009I23DAA,"This has been one of the best video purchases I made in the past year.  Sometimes when we see an old program for the first time in years, we think that it didn't seem quite as good as we remembered.  With ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and this 7-DVD set, the episodes seem even better than I remembered!

What a privilege it has been to laugh along with so many of the funny moments this set has to offer.  I hope to see ""Went With the Wind"" and the first skit done by ""The Family"" many times in the future.  The guest stars are wonderful, and it is a terrific opportunity to watch extremely funny programs without the distraction of foul language.  Great humor really can be clean, and I'm glad that I'll be able to spend more time with Carol and company.",1354147200,58,751,4.253521126760563

5339629,4,B009I23DAA,"***** = the episodes
*** = the DVDs
Don't get me wrong, these are GREAT EPISODES, but for those of us who bought the 31 disc set from Columbia House 10 years ago in 2002, we have them all.
It is disappointing that Carol Burnette & Time Life sprinkled some 10 new episodes in another 22-disc mega-set (NOT THIS 6 DVD SET) forcing us to re-buy most of what we already have, just to get 10 new episodes. And I repeat, those 10 new episodes are NOT on this shorter 7 DVD set (which includes the 6 DVD set listed elsewhere)! You have to get the 22 Disc set. I would quickly buy this set if it had the 10 new episodes.

To top off the insult, if you buy the new 22-disc set to get the 10 new episodes not previously available, you still have to look for the old 31 disc set from 2002 because 22 episodes from that set have been left off of the new 22-disc set.

If I sound cranky it is because I do not want to buy 15 discs of shows that I already have just to get 4 discs of new shows & 3 discs of bonus material. I would still have to keep the old set for the missing 22 episodes.

This 6-disc set is just for those casual fans who either have not bought the previous 2002 31 disc set from Columbia House, or do not want to buy the mega-22 disc set currently being offered from Time-Life. (Old Columbia House DVD disc numbers are in parentheses)

Time Life EDIT note: In the ""Disaster '75"" sketch a tiny bit of the nuns singing a song has been cut out, while it does appear on the Columbia House disc!

For the serious Carol Burnette Show fan, you may want to get the new Time-Life 22-disc Mega-Set instead of this Time-Life 7-disc set.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carol-Burnett-Show-The-Ultimate-Collection-50-Episodes-on-22-DVDs/dp/B009PE2820/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carol Burnett Show: The Ultimate Collection - 50 Episodes on 22 DVDs</a>&nbsp;(SEE UPDATE BELOW ABOUT MISSING SHOWS)
And you may want to look for some of the old Columbia House DVDs to fill in the missing shows: Discs #02, 09, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

It is odd that some of these new DVDs have up to 4 shows per disc while others have only 2 shows.

***2013 UPDATE***  Time-Life has now started adding new shows to two other dealer exclusive sets sold here.  These sets include 5 shows NOT on the 22 disc mega-set, one of which was never sold by Columbia House either!

5339631,5,B009I23DAA,"We use to watch the Carol Burnett show every week and simply loved it. She is a very talented and beautiful lady to be sure, but when she added the talents of Harvey Korman and Tim Conway it only added to the already funny stuff in the skits. My wife's son had the privilege of directing Mr. Conway in one of the many radio dramas he did. He said Tim was as funny off the set as on camera.",1506384000,,389,3.9367088607594938

5339638,5,B009I23DAA,"Love The Carol Burnett Show and am very glad to have ordered this. Carol is still funny after all these years in this great variety series. I know some don't think these shows are as funny anymore, but I disagree. This was a show you could watch with the family and not find much of it to be offensive. Variety shows today like snl and madtv are mean-spirited at times and I don't find them all that funny. SNL used to be good, but not anymore. Some people just don't like safe, family-oriented shows anymore. That's sad. Anyway, Carol will always make me laugh and the item came quickly and efficiently and wasn't damaged. Would do business with this seller anytime.",1475539200,2,667,4.520661157024794

Growing up watching The Carol Burnett Show, this was always one of the go-to things to watch for family time together. We'd crowd around the tv with popcorn and sit laughing for that humorous hour with Carol.

This collection comes with 7 dvd's of some of the best episodes that aired on the Show! Everything is packaged nicely and as soon as you start one episode, you will definitely have to just watch the rest right there!

5339656,3,B009I23DAA,"Although these may have been Carol's favorites, many came up short in this viewer's estimation.  Many of the skits were too long, especially those involving ""Mama"" and ""Eunice"" (Carol's favorite character).  The ""Gone With the Wind"" skit was priceless. One would wish for more episodes involving Tim Conway. Why did she choose only a handful when he was a guest, and apparently none when he became a regular on the show ?",1435536000,3,421,4.833333333333333

Even with those absences, this is an entertaining set and is worth the purchase price.

In summary, fun TV, but could do without the musical selections.

5339765,3,B009I23DAA,"This seven disk collection features 18 shows from 1972 to 1978.  For me I laughed one time (in a Family episode)and there was one funny idea about secret agents selling secret information and the buyer was $20 short so he had to try and make the short-fall up by selling clothing.

Aside from that we see the Jacksons sing a song and later do ""A B C"". One other thing I thought was funny was when they spoofed Tony Orlando and Dawn and then Tony Orlando and Dawn actually showed up, That was funny.

There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the order or selection of the shows, we see a Part 2 of a skit about bed time honesty between a husband and wife and a disk later we see part one. Dinah Shore sings '50 Ways to Leave Your Lover'. Roddy McDowall Ken Berry, Betty White, Carl Reiner, and Vincent Price appear two times each.

During the Q & A people repeatedly ask her to do the Tarzan yell, why? They ask her favorite color, yellow and her favorite actor, Jimmy Stewert and Anthony Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins appears in the audiance at one show. She is asked her sign, she is a Taurus born in April. She is asked if her husband ever attends the show, she says ""NO."" Her husband is the producer.

Each episode of 'The Family' disolves into yelling. Numerous character are browbeat into submission. One profound moment one of Carol's characters says ""Wall Street is a game, insurance is a game.""

Steve Martin appears and they spoof&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beach-Blanket-Bingo/dp/B000IZXB4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beach Blanket Bingo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-Of-The-Third-Kind/dp/B000PNCETC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</a>.

We are treated to spoofs of the ever popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B002W7IH0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport/dp/B002H7NFTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport</a>. Two different times they do the 8th Annual Commercial spoofs.

In the bonus portions that are scattered across the discs we see a 1969 skit with Conway and Korman about a dentist with his first patient that Harvey ends up laughing.  That is when it is funny, when the actors can not help but laugh.

There are cast interviews and commentary as well as interviews of people associated with comedy. Truely a load of material.  Several times she mentions we need to curb polution but does not offer any solution or mention what kind of polution she is taliking about. She does mention something about breathing so it may be air polution, smog perhaps. She also mentions buying war bonds.

Several musical numbers, big like Broadway shows. The opening music and cartoons bring back memories. It was a long time ago.

A real trip down memory lane, insighful information. The set comes with a booklet at the front that contains information about each show on the discs.  Also, an episode of 'The Gary Moore Show' that Carol was on (in Black and White) where she plays&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Girl/dp/0571230636/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Girl</a>&nbsp;and does the Tarzan yell.",1358985600,10,3380,5.871428571428571

The episode of ""The Dentist"" with Tim Conway will make your sides ache from belly laughing so much.  I gave this as a gift & we have watched the shows together.  It was a big hit!  Now I will research other shows of this era.",1357430400,5,313,3.9838709677419355

8541727,2,B009I23DAA,There are many segments where Carol and friends just talk and these are not of interest to me. I wanted to view the actual skits. Disappointed that you cannot forward through each segment to get to the next.  When I try that the DVD jumps forward more than one segment at a time and I cannot view the one i want to see without viewing the boring stuff. I do not recommend this DVD.,1520208000,,381,4.148648648648648
