7846449,5,6303434355,Ken Burns is an amazing documentarian. He brings the West alive in this video. I learned things that I did not know previously.  Take the time to watch. It is well worth the time.,1323129600,,179,4.264705882352941
7846450,5,6303434355,"I wanted an unbiased and detailed review of the impact the US Government and white settlers had on native tribes. This video provides an excellent historical composite of the dishonest and brutal plan of the American Government to basically remove and/or annhilate the tribes from their lands so the West could be exploited and ruled by whites. A sad commentary on American history that forever changed our country and native tribes who were lied to, cheated and psychologically and physically brutalized and murdered for greed and western expansion. A wonderful profile of a noble, resourcesful, environmentaly sensitive people who lost their place on their land and to be doomed to imprisonment on reservations and subsistance dependence on the US Government.  This video series should be required for all high school American history classes. This is also a valuable resource to have in a personal US history collection...another PBS winner.",1304899200,5,944,5.3355704697986575
7846451,4,6303434355,"In style and format, this has all the markings of a Ken Burns documentary, despite being by Ric Burns (the archival photos, actors reading letters and official documents, even the same overall narrator's voice). But the style and format work very well. I teach Native American Lit at a large community college, and I find my students have only a sketchy idea that the indigenous peoples of this continent were ""mistreated,"" but they don't actually know any of the history, what drove both sides to behave as they did. And they need to understand that history, in order to understand even contemporary works by Native authors (why all the Custer jokes, for instance; many of my students don't know who Custer was). I find Episode 4, on the Ghost Dance, particularly useful in giving a sense of the conflict of world views and ideas between the Euro-Americans and the Native peoples. And it is powerfully moving; some students have wept. The Ken Burns documentary is more comprehensive for a history of the West in general, but--as previous reviewers have noted--if you want to get more in-depth information about the Euro-Native conflicts, this one can't be beat.",1252368000,2,1162,4.933673469387755
7846452,4,6303434355,"I've seen both this film and Ken Burns' ""The West"", twice for each. Although this piece is not as long, detailed and comprehensive as Ken Burns' marathon version on the West, it is still a good piece. At least, it serves as an introduction, or is suitable for people who don't like heavy loads.

As the subtitle says, it only covers the years from 1845 to 1893. This arrangement is good enough for most people since most events happened during this period, including Custer's Last Stand, Chief Joseph, Red Cloud's War, Fort Laramie Treaty, Sitting Bull, Buffalo Bill...and so on. In addition, views from both red and white men are presented, which I think it quite balanced.

The story about native people is just one part of the history in the West, which is the main focus of this DVD. For those who want to know more, for example the Mormons, transcontinental railroads, Texas, Gold Rush...etc, I recommend Ken Burns's version.

Overall, I regard this piece as a warm-up for the American West history.",1201996800,14,1004,4.758620689655173
7846453,5,6303434355,"As movies and TV (except HBO) become so stupid and banal as to be unwatchable, I find myself watching more and more documentaries, and this is the best I've ever seen.

Unlike Ric Burns ""The West"" (which covers everything from the Conquistidors in Mexico to the Indians of the Northwest), this focuses almost entirely on the unending battle for the great plains between native americans and the whites. The photography, the narration, the actors readings, and especially the music are first rate, all lending to a sense of inevitable tragedy.

To me this seemed very balanced in presenting both sides of the story. It documents the breaking of treaties and the atrocities committed by Indians every bit as much as those committed by whites. There are several very graphic photos of white men mutilated by Indians. (This is NOT for children.)

I'm at a loss to understand the previous reviews saying this portrays ""all white Christian men"" as evil and all Indians as victims. Over an hour is dedicated to just the Battle of the Little Big Horn. How does that portray Indians as helpless victims?

The fact that these reviewers feel this is an attack on all white Christian men tells us much more about those reviewers than it does about this incredibly moving documentary.",1181606400,30,1271,4.87037037037037
7846454,5,6303434355,I don't know what ax the previous two reviewers had to grind. The documentary gives balanced views from both sides of a very complex story. There are amazing images. This is one of the best documentary series ever produced. I am a college professor and I regularly show episodes to my Introduction to America Studies class. The students say it teaches them things they never learned in American history classes before.,1177545600,16,418,4.901408450704225
7846455,1,6303434355,"MY WIFE IS A DESCENDANT OF THE NATIVE AMERICANS. BUT, THAT BEING SAID. I WANT THE TRUTH. I WANT A BALANCED, HONEST, ACCURATE DOCUMENTARY TO WATCH. I DON'T WANT SOME OF THE FACTS WHILE IGNORING MOST OF THE IMPORTANT FACTS. THERE IS SOME REALY GOOD INFORMATION PRESENTED HERE. I MEAN SOME REALLY INTERESTING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING MOMENTS. BUT, WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO BLAME ALL CHRISTIANS FOR THE GENOCIDE OF THE NATIVE AMERICANS THEY LOSE A LOT OF CREDIBILITY. BE FORWARNED, THIS PRODUCTION IS A GREAT INSULT TO ALL CHRISTIANS. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE RESPONSE WOULD BE IF THEY ATTEMPTED TO INSULT ALL MUSLIMS BECAUSE OF THOSE WHO PERPETRATED THE 911 TERRORISM AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. WELL, I HAVE TRAVELED TO TURKEY. THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY KIND HEARTED AND GENEROUS MUSLIMS IN THE WORLD WHO WANT NOTHING BUT TO BE LEFT ALONE SO THEY CAN ENJOY THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS AND LIFE IN GENERAL.  WATCH 500 NATIONS AND KEN BURN'S PRESENTS THE WEST WITH THIS PRODUCTION. THEN YOU WILL GET A GOOD OVERVIEW.",1171324800,15,998,4.702857142857143
7846456,5,6303434355,A riveting overview of the western experience. Especially toppy on the Indian wars on the Great Plains.,1167955200,3,103,5.117647058823529
7846457,5,6303434355,"In the documentary world, Ken Burns is the number one name. But his brother, Ric Burns, has made a 4 part documentary called ""The Way West"", that was released in 1995, that is one of the best documentaries that I have ever seen! The topic is the westward expansion of the USA, including the Oregon and Mormon Trails, the enounters between whites and Indians, the Gold Rush, and the building of the Transcontinental Railroad.
In his brother's tradition in the ""Civil War"", Ric Burns does a standup job in using the still photos, and make them come to life with music and sound effects, utilizing various excellent historians, such as Momaday, and Stephen Ambrose, and Utley, in the commentary of each and every historical aspect in the docmentary, and the use of various actors portraying the major historical characters, from Custer to Sitting Bull.
This documentary is simply one of the best in portraying these pivitol events in our history. As much as the Civil War has been influential in forming what this nation is now, the binding of the east and west, to the west, the history of the movement of Americans to the west, and the binding of the east to the west with the technological marvel of the 19th century, the Transcontinental Railroad, is one of the greatest periods of our history, and is even more defining that the Civil War, in my opinion.
I think the most chilling portrayal is that of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Of all the dramatization of this event that I have ever seen, from movies to all other documentaries on the subject, this one is the most accurate, breathtaking, and chillingly real portrayal I have ever seen. ""It took as long to kill Custer and his men as it took a hungry man to eat his dinner""...""NOT A LAST STAND""! ""It was like hunting scared buffalo"". These comments are from the film, and Burns does a fine job in using the Indian accounts of the battle, after all, they were the ones who survived it!
If you like this, check out for sure the other documentaries by Ric Burns' brother Ken Burns, particularly ""The Civil War"", ""The West"", and ""Lewis and Clarke"".",1043712000,5,2105,4.646112600536193
