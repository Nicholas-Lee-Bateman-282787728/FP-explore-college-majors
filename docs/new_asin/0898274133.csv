7795506,4,0898274133,"Though we have only just started ""Perfect Blend"" at our church, so far our small group has really liked it.  There are about a dozen of us adults that meet at our church on Wednesday nights for Bible study at the same time as our Children's choir.  When I went looking for a new discipleship resource I went looking for something dealing with faith sharing, on a level that was appropriate for a variety of ages (our youngest member is 18, oldest is 80) and places in both life and faith.  The Participant Journal and DVD are priced reasonably and easily adapted to different groups.  Prep time for leading the small group study is short, but I see that as a plus for the overworked pastor/group leader.  The material is NOT shallow in meaning or substance, but instead the author has done a good job of communicating without being too wordy.  Dito for the DVD; clips are about 10 minutes each - clear, concise, with a good ""hook"" to keep conversation going.  Lessons also are written to include something for participants to ""take away"" from each chapter and a challenge to apply the lesson to daily life.

The only extra work I'm having to go to in leading the study is that our plan was to offer Perfect Blend as a 12 week study, rather than six-weeks.  We are alternating a video clip and lesson with the next week being more group discussion.  For a small membership church, with relatively low Biblical literacy among its members, Perfect Blend is proving itself to be a Perfect starting place for our small group!",1316563200,2,1520,4.575645756457565
