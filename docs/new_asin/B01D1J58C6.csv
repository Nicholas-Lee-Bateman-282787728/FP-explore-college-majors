7696064,5,B01D1J58C6,"I don't own any seasons and this is great, and this does not have to have a bluray for it",1468800000,10,89,3.5
7696065,1,B01D1J58C6,This is Comedy Central's doing. they are greedy unethical SOB's as usual. No blu-ray and they want you to keep buying the same seasons over and over. what a joke,1467417600,23,161,4.4
7696066,1,B01D1J58C6,"As others have mentioned, it is thoroughly appalling that there isn't a Blu-Ray option. I own the first season and after that release there hasn't been a shred of logic in their strategy. They released a combined set of seasons 1 and 2 but no separate season 2, if I'm not mistaken. Then they released season 3. Following that, they don't release season 4 or the last season individually. Now, well after the previous release and without any heads up, they want us to buy the series on DVD. Key & Peele is sure to stand as one of my favorite shows of all time but I won't buy it in this form unless, perhaps years later, it seems that they won't ever issue it in Blu-Ray.",1465430400,35,671,4.291338582677166

7696068,1,B01D1J58C6,"For the love of Pete, WHY???
This show is indestructible, irreplaceable, and refusing to offer it in an HD set is inexcusable! Especially in 2016, a time when everything ought to have an HD option. What a travesty.",1464912000,24,214,4.657894736842105
7696069,1,B01D1J58C6,"Very upsetting to see this. I already own Seasons 1, 2 and 3. Now they're all together, including the rest of the series? Ridiculous.",1464825600,24,133,4.583333333333333

7696076,5,B01D1J58C6,"Ever since i saw keegen on planets funniest animals i loved his mannerisms, Compiled with jordan they make a duel of comedy i haven't seen since blankman. raw and in your face comedy sketches that go beyond offensive but get the laughs they deserve. The DVDs are top quality with good menus but if i choose by episode in menus itll restart the dvd. I am really confused by that.",1517011200,,378,4.414285714285715

7696084,4,B01D1J58C6,At least two of the discs had a read error and wouldn't play. Most played through without any problems.,1506643200,3,103,4.473684210526316
7696085,5,B01D1J58C6,Such a hilarious show and a really great DVD set as well. All episodes are uncensored so if you're somebody that gets their feelings hurt by some naughty words you should probably reconsider. I was apprehensive about this set because it was DVD's and not Blu-rays but after watching a few episodes my fears have been laid to rest. Even with the DVD format the picture quality is great.,1505779200,5,385,4.594202898550725

7696093,5,B01D1J58C6,"Finally, I have the complete series. Although it is not bluray is no problem, because my DVD player does upscaling .

7696097,2,B01D1J58C6,I loved the show on TV but watching back to back episodes... they are racist promoters widening the divide. Not to mention democrats not afraid to show how much they hate republicans.,1493164800,2,183,4.75

7696111,5,B01D1J58C6,"When it comes to sketch comedy duos, the top contenders for me are Fry and Laurie, Mitchell amd Webb, French and Saunders, Cook and Moore, and Mayall and Edmondson. They are all British. Key and Peele stand amongst them as the funniest and most original comedy duos in America. And in the world. The call back joke at the end of the series did what no other sketch comedy has done for me. I laughed, and then i felt a little sad, content for the journey, but sorry it was over.",1482364800,3,477,4.252747252747253
7696112,5,B01D1J58C6,"Like all of the reviewers I'm a huge K&P fan. Unlike some reviewers who need to see it HD or Blu-ray (which I think is arrogant and obnoxious but that's just me...), I've just been waiting for seasons 4 and 5 on DVD....patiently, to add to my seasons 1-3.  And like most of you I'm pretty pissed that you have to purchase the whole series to get 4 and 5.  It's So wrong.

8754656,5,B01D1J58C6,"These two are arguably the best comedic duo since Abbot and Costello. Their skits are funny and high production value. I'll miss this show, but I'm excited to see the projects they move on to.

The box art is nice and compact for how many disks are inside. This is great for the price, and a must buy for K&P fans.",1524268800,,314,4.147540983606557
8754657,4,B01D1J58C6,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching through these discs and continue to be amazed at just how funny so many of them are.

The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that a grand majority of their skits are already available online on YouTube.

If you've seen all those videos, you are basically missing about 10-15% of the show, and I don't think buying this set would be worth it.",1524009600,,380,4.414285714285715
