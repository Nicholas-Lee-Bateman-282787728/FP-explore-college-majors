8431214,4,B004ITYDW0,"I got this of course expecting a good documentary, but it was better than I anticipated.  The Holy Bloodline is a very hot topic, and a lot of what gets brought to light in this dvd is the stuff that shakes the great majority.  It might make some uncomfortable, but that's how change for the better always happens, and truth is always better than fiction.",1383177600,,355,4.446153846153846
8431215,4,B004ITYDW0,"Even though I have studied religion somewhat I still have holes in my knowledge. It's great to hear some different opinions on who Jesus was exactly. Not for the easily offended, but you probably wouldn't be buying this anyway if you are.",1362960000,,238,4.690476190476191
8431216,2,B004ITYDW0,"The information contained in the dvd provided individuals who have varying opitions (good) and who seemed to have conducted extensive research (good).

What I didn't like was the quality of the production.  I did not realize it was a documentary which looks to have been taken from a show that airs in England somewhere.  I could have YouTubed the information for free.",1358121600,,369,4.919354838709677

Real Jesus: Legacy Of Deception

""Billions of people around the globe believe in the man called Jesus Christ. Dogma and doctrine have enveloped the original tales of this enigmatic Son of God. But what has been covered up? What secrets are only now coming to light about the life, work and family of the most famous man ever to have lived? What is the Holy Grail? Is it a Royal and Holy Bloodline descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene...but that's just fiction isn't it? For many people, the tale revolves around a small parish in southern France and the strange world of the priest. What mystery was he hiding? What does it all have to do with Rosslyn Chapel and the Da Vinci Code? In this amazing box set you will discover firsthand from best selling authors, and renowned experts from around the globe, just what the truth is about the Bloodline of Jesus Christ.""

So they are dishing the ""dirt"" on Jesus' bloodline, as if there isn't enough of that on afternoon television and the divorce court shows seeking to find out the dna patternity tests to see who fathered who. I suppose if they could,they would run a dna test to see if God really was his father or what, and produce a 3set dvd on that too. To paraphrase the above ""For many people, the tale DOES NOT revolves around a small parish in southern France, but instead revolves around blind faith and not looking for any holes or breaks to weaken faith and crumble it with baloney about the bloodline of Jesus Christ, as if he is a pedigreed dog."" Real Christians don't give any credence of any kind of mysterious power to the Holy Grail because that is idolatry. The Holy Grail is just an old cup, people, and nothing more---would fetch a fantastic price at an antique show, but it does not possess supernatural properties or pass on special mystical powers to any decendents.",1305504000,,1966,4.535211267605634
