This time the Time Scanners are in London [U.K] to discover the incredible building legacy of St. Pauls Cathedral, from its world-famous majestic dome to the scars of history that give us an insight into its turbulent past.

The above comes from the beginning of this fascinating, fast-paced documentary, an episode of the Time Scanners series.

The Time Scanners use cutting-edge, mobile 3D laser-scanning technology to put seventeenth-century St. Pauls Cathedral to the test, exploring the secrets of how it was constructed.

Engineer Steve Burrows takes his laser-scanning team to this architectural masterpiece in the heart of London.  The laser-scanning team is from the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (located at the University of Arkansas).

Burrows has over three decades of experience in engineering buildings around the world, leading the engineering of many significant projects.  He is a chartered engineer in the U.K., and a professional engineer in California.  As well, he is a Fellow of the Institute of Civil Engineers, a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and a member of the Institution of Structural Engineers.

Burrows and the team explore the cathedrals majestic dome (365 feet above London and weighing 65,000 tons) and analyse its structure, they discover how the cathedrals architect Sir Christopher Wren (1632 to 1723) dealt with unstable foundations and immense structural forces to support the dome, and they investigate how the cathedral survived a direct hit by a German bomb during the London Blitz (in 1941).

By the end of this program, you will realize that by transforming ancient stone and structures into exact digital models, Burrows and his team have managed to reveal the engineering secrets of Londons St. Pauls Cathedral and have delved into the mind of an architectural geniusSir Christopher Wren.

Finally, the filming and scans throughout this documentary are just magnificent.  We are also privy to good historical knowledge (thanks to the excellent narration and excellent archival materials).

In conclusion, this documentary effectively reveals the architectural secrets of an architectural masterpiece!!

8651447,4,B00JJRLFWW,".but thought that this was one very good program when it aired on PBS. Lots of details and information that the viewer probably just won't get otherwise. Unless access has changed since I saw St. Paul's over 20 years ago when watching this DVD you'll get to see details you can't get on the tour itself. This DVD is great!, just wish it was longer and blu ray. If you're going to London you should go see St. Paul's, watch this DVD first, so many details that you can see..if you know to look for them.",1478044800,,502,4.239583333333333
