8686450,5,B00P5O6UPU,"This is one of the most life-changing (if not the most, I go with most) retreats you will ever take. Don't take Fr. Timothy Gallagher's calm demeanor lightly, he is a master teaching the way of a true Master, the discerning of the spirits as taught by Jesuit Founder, St. Ignatius. I can say I've read all of St. Ignatius's books, taken about 20 classes on his teachings. This retreat was the one that changed my life. This one is a PLEASE DON'T MISS THIS, it will change your life kindof event. And it is worth much more than it costs. It is literally worth years of spiritual/psychological therapy. The techniques he teaches will change every aspect of how you deal with your daily life and how you view everything. I cannot speak highly enough of it, it is a masterpiece!",1428624000,4,774,4.49645390070922
