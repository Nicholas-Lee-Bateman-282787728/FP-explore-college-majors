3035144,4,B000YQRAIK,Remembered this movie from when I was in junior high school.  Couldn't resist seeing if it was still as funny as my memoriy was of it.  It passed!  Some are not as funny as I remembered but overall it still regularly brings a guilty laugh.  We were weird back then to say the least.,1362355200,,282,4.166666666666667

3035148,5,B000YQRAIK,"Hooray for Amazon's related items and recommendations! I was shopping for 9 1/2 Weeks and some other steamy-but-girlfriend-approved movies to buy during the holiday sales, and discovered this forgotten gem. I think it was an attempt to make another mainstream-porno crossover film in the wake of Deep Throat, but got lost in the noise of the censorship controversy and has yet to be rediscovered.

To wit: the packaging of this DVD is incredibly sparse. The back cover is lacking the usual wall of DVD format and feature information. Inside, there are no inserts and the DVD itself looks to be an individual burn rather than a mass pressing. There aren't any menus-- when you load it, it simply plays the movie on repeat. The image is full screen, but a few scenes (the opening and closing credits in particular) are squished instead of cropped. Clearly the DVD was a low budget labor of love on somebody's part to keep this film from disappearing forever.

And I'm glad. Once you get past the sparse presentation, the movie itself is a real treat-- a genuinely funny parody of both afternoon soap operas and 70's porno movies, loaded with one liners and gags from start to finish. The announcer/narrator and the cast give earnestly hammy performances and you can tell that everyone working on this movie is having a blast.

This is uncensored comedy, not a porno; there is pervasive nudity and much playing around, but very little hardcore sex. What little there is, is played for humorous effect, and so is the occasional profanity (the announcer in particular drops a few abrupt bombs with great timing). The TV parody style of humor here is reminiscent of The Groove Tube (which precedes this by a year) but the structure is much simpler and there is no sign of the ""skit buffet"" format often found elsewhere.

Between a corny opening/ending sequence featuring a topless woman soaping herself up to a theme song that's an Ode to -- what else -- Soap, there is a single ""episode"" of a phony afternoon soap opera, complete with periodic ""a word from our sponsor"" commercials and narrator story recaps and so on. Our ""story"" begins as our ""hero"" moves into his new apartment at the ""Whispering Palms"". However, he is (of course) quickly sucked into the various intrigues (and bedrooms) of his neighbors. Hilarity and hijinks (and other stuff) ensue.

I won't spoil the surprises (and there are many) by giving away the plot, but I will say that the sexuality of this movie is all over the map, with that classic 70's sort of frankness that seems downright refreshing after 30+ years of Raunch Movie Evolution that pushes the boundaries of being ""R"" Rated. There is some light kink, lesbianism and group sex -- but no male homosexuality; no surprise there, really, but it shows how far we've come since even the 70's.

There are also pedophilia jokes -- one of the characters is ""a 16-year old girl with the body of a woman"" played by a very obviously adult actress. Quite effective fun is made of the porno staple of young-looking adults cast as minors. And there's even a bizarre dated political reference. Watch for it.

All in all, this movie was a delightful surprise and I would love to get my hands on a proper widescreen transfer, or better yet, a proper ""cult classic"" DVD treatment with behind the scenes bonus material and other goodies.

Beware of the DVD release of this title,it has 22 minutes cut out of it.
The VHS should run around 90 minutes to be complete.
I bought a double feature of this from the ""Catcom"" company,real lame.

8233922,1,B000YQRAIK,"Absolutely terrible. A parody of soap operas with a tawdry plot nudity and unfunny risque humor.  I remember when it came out and trying to sneak into the theater to see it, unsuccessfully.  I did, however sneak in to see ""The Groove Tube"" back in the day and I had hoped this film was of the same caliber. It is not. While ""The Groove Tube"" has brief nudity risque humor it is, for the most part, actually funny. 'Groove' was a precursor to SNL and features Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer. 'Boob' has no noteworthy actors and is just plain boring. If you REALLY feel the need to watch it send me your address and I'll mail  it to you.
