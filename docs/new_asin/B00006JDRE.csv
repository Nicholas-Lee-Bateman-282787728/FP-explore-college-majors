1782338,4,B00006JDRE,"I agree with another reviewer that the Chanukah show is a bit more entertaining than the Passover show, but both have some good, creative songs and are imbued with simple lessons about the true meanings behind these two holidays.

Some of the highlights of the Chanukah show include a really cute number Shari and Lamb Chop do in the kitchen while making potato latkes, a comic bit about how Chanukah is spelled and how the ""Ch"" should be pronounced, and a very creative and catchy song entitled ""The Eight Nights of Chanukah""--which is sung to the tune of the Twelve Days of Christmas.

Among the highlights of the Passover show is a number that Dom DeLuise and Shari perform together. But there's one scene with Robert Guillaume portraying Pharaoh that could be a little scary for little ones because he looks and sounds very mean; even the way he is filmed is slightly distorted.

There are plenty of corny moments within these shows, some intentional, some not. Especially corny are some of the scenes with the 'stars'--Alan Thicke in particular seems to really enjoy playing the cornball. You may have moments where you're rolling your eyes at some of the jokes. And some of the non-musical scenes can run a bit long. But all in all, there's no denying that these shows were made with the best of intentions, and they are entertaining and educational. Clearly, everyone had fun making these.

There aren't a lot of Jewish holiday specials out there, so give this a chance. You won't be disappointed.",1163462400,21,1504,4.773076923076923
1782339,5,B00006JDRE,This is an excellent and fun production. The Chanukah segment is better than the Passover part of this DVD but it's a DVD we would recomment for anyone's home library. Pure enjoyment.,1124236800,11,183,4.75

1782343,5,B00006JDRE,"""Everybody is nice in the movie.  Lambchop is cute and I learned stuff about Chanukah.  They had a nice story that they made from the Chanukah movie.  Charlie Horse won the first place and that was the coolest thing because they got presents.  They all were nice to each other.  They all had a nice nice day and everybody was kind and Hush Puppy was cute too.""

1782348,2,B00006JDRE,"I didn't love this. It had a very corny '80's feel to it (which I grew up in), but purchased this for my young child. The whole super hero part of it was just weird. I did like the singing, and the puppets were cute, but I just couldn't deal with the over the top cheesiness of it. Hoping the Passover video is much better. We shall wait and see. :)",1419724800,,349,3.9295774647887325
1782349,5,B00006JDRE,Very difficult to get Lambchop on DVD so I had! to have this edition. I remember taping this episode on the VCR. Thank you! My daughter used to be called Lambchop by her uncle,1415836800,2,175,4.176470588235294

1782360,5,B00006JDRE,"Let's start with the simplest statement of them all. You do not need to be jewish to enjoy these specials, which is possibly the best compliment you can give to such a special. The two specials included are full of the wit and charm that all Shari Lewis specials have, you can tell that she put her heart into this and it's a beautiful blend of educational and entertaining. Yes you can learn about the two big jewish holidays here if you want too, or you can just put it in and laugh and smile along with the joy of the episodes. Seeing the guest stars that turn up adds another little layer of silliness onto everything, Alan Thicke and Dom Delouise bring their A game and are full of light and joy and of course Shari is her usual consumate entertainer. The best holiday specials I've seen in a long long time.",1360022400,2,813,4.3202614379084965
1782361,5,B00006JDRE,"The Hanukkah and Passover stories are very nice for Jewish preschoolers.  The puppets and music keep the kids engaged, and they are learning the history behind the holidays and the customs, traditional foods, etc, at the same time.",1359244800,,231,5.078947368421052

My daughter has loved these movies since she was 18 months old!  She literally wore out the VHS editions after watching them all year round, over an over!

She is now 20, and was so excited when I gave this to her at Thanksgiving when she was home from college! We watched 4 times over Thanksgiving, and she and her friends have watched numerous times since she went back to school.

She will be home for her winter break on 12/10/12, and no doubt we will match it some more!

This is a classic for kids of all ages!! Great way to teach young Jewish and non-Jewish children about these religious holidays.",1354579200,2,813,5.677685950413223
1782364,5,B00006JDRE,"This is a delightful, entertaining and funny videotape. The sketch about making soup is one of the funniest routines I've ever seen, and my sons and I quoted it for many years. Buy and enjoy!",1342656000,,191,4.485714285714286
1782365,5,B00006JDRE,"We have used this tape in the past for teaching Christian children about Passach and Chanukah. Unfortunately, it was so good someone borrowed it an kept it - hence the purchase. The information keeps the children interested and quiet. The only downfall is that now all the characters, puppets and stars are no longer familiar to modrn audiences. Of course, this DVD brings them back into focus. It fills a need where there is little else for children.",1332374400,,451,4.794871794871795
1782366,5,B00006JDRE,"For the last, probably, 10 years or so, we have watched Lambchop's Hanukkah every Decemberish.  My kids are now 14 and 16 and *still* want me to put it on every year.  We CRACK UP at the story.  The jokes are sweet and heartwarming and there is a lovely story behind it all.  Best part: Lambchop's tears when they're cutting the onions.  We're crying every year when that happens.",1313107200,,380,4.449275362318841
1782367,5,B00006JDRE,"Lambchop's playalong was my favorite tv show growing up and this dvd does not disappoint.

These dvds are also educational for non-Jews who are curious to some of the customs surrounding Chanukah and Passover.",1268265600,,356,5.016949152542373
1782368,5,B00006JDRE,"I have watched this video every year since I was a little girl during Chanukah - and I'm not even Jewish!  This video can be enjoyed by parents and children alike, and it is VERY educational.  Not only do you learn about how Chanukah is celebrated, but about WHY it is celebrated.  I'm currently a college student and I am taking a course in Judaism, and I started reading about Chanukah in one of my textbooks.  I knew everything they were talking about, and it's all because of this video.  The songs and the plot are great, and the whole family can laugh and learn.

I got this for friends as gifts, and they al love it., my youngest, who is 8 now, looks forward to watching it, again and again, around the holidays. Both Hanukkah and Passover shows are fabulous.

These shows in particular are educational - great for introducing children to these well-known Jewish holidays, but you certainly don't need to be Jewish to enjoy the shows and appreciate the history and importance of these holidays.",1463443200,2,468,4.85
