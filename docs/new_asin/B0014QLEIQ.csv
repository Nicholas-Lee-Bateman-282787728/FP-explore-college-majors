3133977,4,B0014QLEIQ,"Ice Cube stars as a struggling young father who's life revolves around his young son.  Although he has somewhat of a rocky relationship with the boy's mother, he is a mainstay in his child's life.  Until his ex tells him that unless she can come up with 17K to maintain her beauty salon, she'll have to move to Atlanta.  Determined not to let his son leave the city of Baltimore, Cube teams up with childhood friend LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) to rob an inner city church....but when things don't go exactly  as planned, the two instead find themselves being ministered to by the church's congregation (Loretta Devine, Katt Williams).....and everyone discovers that an even bigger rat may be hiding amidst the holier than thou.
Another respectable product by Cube....reinforcing his credibility as an actor/producer.  Comedic relief is abundant thanks to Katt Williams and Tracy Morgan...I laughed out loud thoughout.  If you're looking for something fun and light with an undercurrent of seriousness, you've found it.  Grab the popcorn and enjoy.

3133978,1,B0014QLEIQ,"Sometimes you rent a film like this in hopes that however much it may lack in an actual storyline or moral values, it makes up in downright hilarious slapstick humor. You see the problem here is that ""First Sunday"" is not even funny. I can forgive a comedy of this sort for wandering off the storyline from time to time in order to up the laughs, but Ice Cube's, ""First Sunday"", wanders off far too many times and doesn't even make up for it with any funny parts (or at least no memorable parts).

Tracey Morgan and the hilarious stand-up artist, Katt Williams, do their best to try and salavge the film with one or two knee slappers but the problem is the writers. The writers don't give the actors half enough of the comedic material that they need to pull everything off. I also have quite a bit of respect for Ice Cube as an actor, and I don't blame him for this (I blame the creators), but his lead character in ""First Sunday"" is just about as bland and boring as they come. If your planning on making a film full of laughs my first suggestion is to give your main character a sense of humor. Ice Cube does not smile one time throughout the film so while all of his supporting characters are running around trying to pull some funnies, he is angrily pointing a gun at a 70 year old woman and a pastor. It's awkward.

If you want to see a good movie of this type I suggest going out and renting one of Tyler Perry's films.",1211241600,,1426,4.238970588235294
3133979,1,B0014QLEIQ,"Ice Cube's movies are getting weaker and weaker. I can only stand two movies that Ice Cube was in: Friday(the first one) and Higher Learning. Next Friday, Friday After Next, XXX- State Of The Union, Are We There Yet and Are We Done Yet are straight garbage. First Sunday is just as weak.

Premise: Durell(Ice Cube) and Leejon(Tracy Morgan) are two crooks who decide to rob a church after Durell runs out of options. You see Durell's baby mother is planning to take his son with her to Atlanta and Durrel doesnt want that. Things go from bad to worse when they cant find the money and parishioners are coming in so Durell and Leejohn decide to take them hostage till they find the money.

Opinion: The biggest problem with this movie besides the weak script is that its not funny! Every joke falls on its face with a resounding thud.  Tracey Morgan? Was he ever funny? And Katt Williams is as dry as sandpaper here. There are some touching moments in this movie: When Durell interacts with his son, when Loretta Devine's character sings happy birthday to Leejon who never had that experience and when the elder scolded Durell for what he was doing and he saw himself in the mirror. Those scenes are not bad but they still are not a good enough reason to see this movie. The movie is still as bland as an episode of Saturday Night Live and for a movie to stretch at 95 minutes its an hour and 35 minutes longer than it needs to be. Another thing, do black baby mothers have to be portrayed so negatively in these flicks? Durell's baby mother is such a raging (fill in the blank) that if she got belted nobody would feel sympathy for her. It's just a movie right? Please. After an hour into the movie you already can predict the ending. Its just that predictable. First Sunday should be treated like Jehovah's Witnesses when you see them. With avoidance. Amen to that!",1211155200,6,1865,4.479411764705882
3133980,5,B0014QLEIQ,"This movie is definitely going in the comedy classic section.  The Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan pairing reminded me of the comedy days of Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, and Sydney Poitier.  I highly recommend it.  It also had a great message about single fathers.  David E. Talbert hit a home run in my book.",1210723200,2,301,4.518518518518518
3133981,3,B0014QLEIQ,"I go into this review on the defensive.  Looking up some information on the movie, I peeked and saw it is not highly esteemed by professionals or amateurs.  Sporting a likable Tracy Morgan and the natural presence of Ice Cube, I found `First Sunday' to be flawed, but funny.  There's an undeniable sit-com presence in its making, and there's a whole lot of suspension of disbelief that doesn't get off the ground, yet 'First Sunday' did get me chuckling fairly often once it got going and made me a little misty eyed when they went for the message and feeling.

The hijinx begins with Durell (Ice Cube) and Lee John (Tracy Morgan) two long-suffering buddies staying in trouble.  I can't say I could figure out the starting circumstances even after rewinding, but I think they're delivering drugs by transporting wheelchairs.  They aren't very good criminals.  Most criminals aren't, but they aren't all that effective, either.  Let's just say they get quickly caught and don't have the cool to slip out of the knot.  Facing court, their trial is held by a judge (Keith David) who has seen them many times before.  Perhaps out of compassion or out of disgust, he trades their time for 5,000 hours of community service.  Immediately, their outbursts indicate they aren't too grateful, but service they do.

It's a hard break for Durell's estranged lady love (Regina Hall) who doesn't have enough money for her beauty salon which requires back pay.  Durell brings over forty dollars, but she announces she will have to leave and take their son (C.J. Sanders), to Atlanta where her livelihood will be more affordable.  He doesn't want to lose him, and it doesn't help that her new lover, Ralph, is built like a gym rat, so he`s determined to do something.

We get a lot of random scenes on the community service circuit and in a massage parlor, but one day Durrell is inspired.  Distracted by the bottom of an attractive woman, Durell finds his way to her church.  He and Lee John join them on a Sunday, but are no closer to converting as much as following up on Durell's lustful interest in Tianna (Melinda Willams).  It is after the financial reports are read at church that they get an idea:  After hours they will come and rob the church.

I won't give up the core of the bumbling adventure, but they end up being caught on a night the Deacon (Michael Keith David) checks the safe, a financial meeting takes place with the pastor (Chi McBride of `Boston Public') and Rickey, the choir director (Katt Williams) is engaged in singing practice.  The confrontation turns to a hostage situation that brings most of the movies heart and humor.

It must be conceded that this movie is dumb.  However, if one considers the premise of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Like-It-Hot/dp/B00005A06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Like It Hot</a>,' an AFI comedy classic, where the characters escape witnessing a mob massacre by dressing in drag and going to Florida, then dumb can count.  It's how you do dumb that matters.  Don't get me wrong, by no means am I saying this is the next 'Some Like It Hot,' but I found it more entertaining than `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liar-Liar/dp/0783225512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liar Liar</a>,' and it exceeds the reputation of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Momma-s-House-2/dp/B000F1IQHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Momma's House 2</a>'.

As someone who liked watching 'The Tracy Morgan Show,' a Cosby inspired sitcom, I felt that Morgan was likable, but somewhat limited here.  He was shrill, but I enjoyed Ice Cube's collected and believable performance.  The supporting cast, especially the church personnel, give natural performances, but Katt Williams steals the show as Rickey, the choir director.

I can forgive 'First Sunday''s failings.  Despite the temptation to dismiss the film as just another stupid comedy adventure, `First Sunday' is forgivably funny.  It is entertaining with a moving message and a supporting cast that helps bridge the credibility gap.",1210464000,3,4134,5.294478527607362

Tracy plays his friend who is trying to get money to pay back Jamaican gangsters for 10 wheelchairs that cost $12,000 dollars each.  Yea, I thought that was silly, but at the same time, uniquely funny.  And so from there the adventure begins.

Eventually, Tracy's character, Lee John, gets an idea to rob a church.  Ice Cube's character, Durell, was against the idea at first, but eventually agreed to do it.  In this church, they run into problems, and they learn about their mistakes and shortcomings.  I thought this movie was funny and at times sensible.  I liked Katt Williams, too.  He was very funny.

I usually have a favorite character, but I have to say that they were all equally fun to watch.  But my favorite scene was when Cube and Tracy were in the church for the first time, and the choir was singing.  The choir was so awesome.  I really enjoyed the singing a lot.

A very appealing cast is left with little to work with in ""First Sunday,"" a manufactured comedy whose script fails to rise to the level of its actors.  Desperate for some quick cash, Durell and LeeJohn come up with a scheme to break into a local church and carry off the fund earmarked for construction of a new building.  Unfortunately, this seemingly simple robbery quickly turns into a complicated hostage situation when a dozen or so of the most prominent church members unexpectedly show up on the scene.

""First Friday"" does elicit a few hearty laughs, due, in large part, to its game cast and the occasional funny line scattered in and amongst the numerous clunkers.  Ice Cube effectively plays straight man to Tracy Morgan`s endearingly bumbling sidekick, and they, together with the other actors, help to comprise a fine comic ensemble.  The problem lies in a screenplay which often goes for the obvious joke over something truly original or clever, and which pours on the syrup to alarming proportions near the end just to ensure the movie its status as a morally upright, ""feel-good"" comedy.

It's a harmless enough little diversion if you have some time to kill, but the company is far more appetizing than what it is they`re dishing up.",1216252800,6,1256,4.841121495327103

I would have wanted it to have actually been filmed here in Baltimore. Then, maybe it would have not looked as if it were shot elsewhere, which it showed badly.

I had fun with the film and the message it left. It was all about salvation, redemption, forgiveness and self-worth. We live in harsh times and this movie showed the depth of what one would do to survive. It happens everyday and at anytime but this flick added the real and the humorous view when the news @ 9 shows the horrific. I plan on purchasing the DVD for the extras no doubt.

3368475,1,B0014QLEIQ,"Sometimes you rent a film like this in hopes that however much it may lack in an actual storyline or moral values, it makes up in downright hilarious slapstick humor. You see the problem here is that ""First Sunday"" is not even funny. I can forgive a comedy of this sort for wandering off the storyline from time to time in order to up the laughs, but Ice Cube's, ""First Sunday"", wanders off far too many times and doesn't even make up for it with any funny parts (or at least no memorable parts).

Tracey Morgan and the hilarious stand-up artist, Katt Williams, do their best to try and salavge the film with one or two knee slappers but the problem is the writers. The writers don't give the actors half enough of the comedic material that they need to pull everything off. I also have quite a bit of respect for Ice Cube as an actor, and I don't blame him for this (I blame the creators), but his lead character in ""First Sunday"" is just about as bland and boring as they come. If your planning on making a film full of laughs my first suggestion is to give your main character a sense of humor. Ice Cube does not smile one time throughout the film so while all of his supporting characters are running around trying to pull some funnies, he is angrily pointing a gun at a 70 year old woman and a pastor. It's awkward.

If you want to see a good movie of this type I suggest going out and renting one of Tyler Perry's films.",1211241600,,1426,4.238970588235294
3368476,1,B0014QLEIQ,"Ice Cube's movies are getting weaker and weaker. I can only stand two movies that Ice Cube was in: Friday(the first one) and Higher Learning. Next Friday, Friday After Next, XXX- State Of The Union, Are We There Yet and Are We Done Yet are straight garbage. First Sunday is just as weak.

Premise: Durell(Ice Cube) and Leejon(Tracy Morgan) are two crooks who decide to rob a church after Durell runs out of options. You see Durell's baby mother is planning to take his son with her to Atlanta and Durrel doesnt want that. Things go from bad to worse when they cant find the money and parishioners are coming in so Durell and Leejohn decide to take them hostage till they find the money.

Opinion: The biggest problem with this movie besides the weak script is that its not funny! Every joke falls on its face with a resounding thud.  Tracey Morgan? Was he ever funny? And Katt Williams is as dry as sandpaper here. There are some touching moments in this movie: When Durell interacts with his son, when Loretta Devine's character sings happy birthday to Leejon who never had that experience and when the elder scolded Durell for what he was doing and he saw himself in the mirror. Those scenes are not bad but they still are not a good enough reason to see this movie. The movie is still as bland as an episode of Saturday Night Live and for a movie to stretch at 95 minutes its an hour and 35 minutes longer than it needs to be. Another thing, do black baby mothers have to be portrayed so negatively in these flicks? Durell's baby mother is such a raging (fill in the blank) that if she got belted nobody would feel sympathy for her. It's just a movie right? Please. After an hour into the movie you already can predict the ending. Its just that predictable. First Sunday should be treated like Jehovah's Witnesses when you see them. With avoidance.

3368478,3,B0014QLEIQ,"I go into this review on the defensive.  Looking up some information on the movie, I peeked and saw it is not highly esteemed by professionals or amateurs.  Sporting a likable Tracy Morgan and the natural presence of Ice Cube, I found `First Sunday' to be flawed, but funny.  There's an undeniable sit-com presence in its making, and there's a whole lot of suspension of disbelief that doesn't get off the ground, yet 'First Sunday' did get me chuckling fairly often once it got going and made me a little misty eyed when they went for the message and feeling.

The hijinx begins with Durell (Ice Cube) and Lee John (Tracy Morgan) two long-suffering buddies staying in trouble.  I can't say I could figure out the starting circumstances even after rewinding, but I think they're delivering drugs by transporting wheelchairs.  They aren't very good criminals.  Most criminals aren't, but they aren't all that effective, either.  Let's just say they get quickly caught and don't have the cool to slip out of the knot.  Facing court, their trial is held by a judge (Keith David) who has seen them many times before.  Perhaps out of compassion or out of disgust, he trades their time for 5,000 hours of community service.  Immediately, their outbursts indicate they aren't too grateful, but service they do.

It's a hard break for Durell's estranged lady love (Regina Hall) who doesn't have enough money for her beauty salon which requires back pay.  Durell brings over forty dollars, but she announces she will have to leave and take their son (C.J. Sanders), to Atlanta where her livelihood will be more affordable.  He doesn't want to lose him, and it doesn't help that her new lover, Ralph, is built like a gym rat, so he`s determined to do something.

We get a lot of random scenes on the community service circuit and in a massage parlor, but one day Durrell is inspired.  Distracted by the bottom of an attractive woman, Durell finds his way to her church.  He and Lee John join them on a Sunday, but are no closer to converting as much as following up on Durell's lustful interest in Tianna (Melinda Willams).  It is after the financial reports are read at church that they get an idea:  After hours they will come and rob the church.

I won't give up the core of the bumbling adventure, but they end up being caught on a night the Deacon (Michael Keith David) checks the safe, a financial meeting takes place with the pastor (Chi McBride of `Boston Public') and Rickey, the choir director (Katt Williams) is engaged in singing practice.  The confrontation turns to a hostage situation that brings most of the movies heart and humor.

It must be conceded that this movie is dumb.  However, if one considers the premise of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Like-It-Hot/dp/B00005A06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Like It Hot</a>,' an AFI comedy classic, where the characters escape witnessing a mob massacre by dressing in drag and going to Florida, then dumb can count.  It's how you do dumb that matters.  Don't get me wrong, by no means am I saying this is the next 'Some Like It Hot,' but I found it more entertaining than `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liar-Liar/dp/0783225512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liar Liar</a>,' and it exceeds the reputation of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Momma-s-House-2/dp/B000F1IQHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Momma's House 2</a>'.

As someone who liked watching 'The Tracy Morgan Show,' a Cosby inspired sitcom, I felt that Morgan was likable, but somewhat limited here.  He was shrill, but I enjoyed Ice Cube's collected and believable performance.  The supporting cast, especially the church personnel, give natural performances, but Katt Williams steals the show as Rickey, the choir director.

I can forgive 'First Sunday''s failings.  Despite the temptation to dismiss the film as just another stupid comedy adventure, `First Sunday' is forgivably funny.  It is entertaining with a moving message and a supporting cast that helps bridge the credibility gap.",1210464000,3,4134,5.294478527607362

First Sunday has good actors and a few good messages. I don't think this comedy would have been very funny, though, if it wasn't for Katt Williams. The movie became enjoyable when his character, Ricky, was introduced. I always appreciate a good belly laugh and Katt's quick-witted comebacks were hilarious!

The mother of the church put me in mind of my grandmother (R.I.P) when she read Ice Cubes character and then turned her back on him, the look on her face when she turned back around..priceless! Also Chi McBride as the preacher is wonderful as well, he did what any real minister of God would have done..Do not judge/lest ye be judged, not trying to preach, just saying. Overall great movie. If you're a fan of Loretta, Katt, or Ice Cube as I am, then this is a must have for your DVD collection.",1352073600,,825,4.4635761589403975

I am coming from a Christian point of view too: I like how they wanted the church planted in the ghetto and how they showed unconditional love and forgiveness towards those who don't deserve it; none of us do.

It's not an un-watchable film, but I've seen too many of these half-baked sentimental comedies to watch one that just doesn't cut it. If you can get through the slow first half, it does get better in the second.....just not enough for me to recommend it.",1230854400,2,368,4.590909090909091

Unfortunately I did not bother to go online and look at reviews and rather went on a hit and miss and bought it. From the first 5 minutes I knew I had wasted my money and was wasting my time watching this train wreck of a movie. Tracy Morgan and Katt Williams are some of the funniest comedians out there and Ice Cube showed off his comedic acting with the excellent Friday. The whole premise of the movie is brought on in the first 5 minutes and from there on is bad acting at its finest. I can't believe how some movies get the funding to be made, don't they read the scripts before hand? This movie is not worth watching unless your doing  research on unfunny movies with funny actors.",1225756800,3,822,4.303225806451613

Tracy Morgan's character wasn't funny enough, and Katt Williams' talents were wasted over a character who didn't have any funny lines at all. Ice Cube plays the exactly same part he plays in all of his movies... It's a deccent drama, but definitely not a comedy. A huge dissapointment, and that's why the movie failed worldwide.",1220659200,,502,4.781609195402299

3368617,5,B0014QLEIQ,"This movie was hilarious.  I watched it on my DVD player while at the Beauty Shop underneath the dryer and laughed so much that people were inquiring as to what I was watching.  Normally I have problems with purchasing DVDs on Amazon because sellers are not as truthful about the condition of DVDs as they should be, some even have rewrapped them in shrink wrap to deceive, and they are full of scratches when opened, but this one played flawlessly and was a riot.

I was never a fan of Kat Williams until this movie, but he actually made the movie in my opinion and actually made up for Tracy Morgan's acting skills (he always seems as if he is reading from cue cards).  I am going to watch it again this weekend at the Beauty Shop.
I would certainly recommend this DVD to others to purchase, especially if you want a good laugh.",1217548800,,830,4.37012987012987
3368618,4,B0014QLEIQ,"Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan star in this movie as two guys needing to get money.  Ice Cube plays a father who is trying to get money to stop his ex from taking his son to Atlanta.  Tracy plays his friend who is trying to get money to pay back Jamaican gangsters for 10 wheelchairs that cost $12,000 dollars each.  Yea, I thought that was silly, but at the same time, uniquely funny.  And so from there the adventure begins.

Eventually, Tracy's character, Lee John, gets an idea to rob a church.  Ice Cube's character, Durell, was against the idea at first, but eventually agreed to do it.  In this church, they run into problems, and they learn about their mistakes and shortcomings.  I thought this movie was funny and at times sensible.  I liked Katt Williams, too.  He was very funny.

I usually have a favorite character, but I have to say that they were all equally fun to watch.  But my favorite scene was when Cube and Tracy were in the church for the first time, and the choir was singing.  The choir was so awesome.  I really enjoyed the singing a lot.

Overall, I think this movie was pretty good.  I laughed, was surprised at times, and even felt inspirational during the choir singing scene.  Not too bad at all.

A very appealing cast is left with little to work with in ""First Sunday,"" a manufactured comedy whose script fails to rise to the level of its actors.  Desperate for some quick cash, Durell and LeeJohn come up with a scheme to break into a local church and carry off the fund earmarked for construction of a new building.  Unfortunately, this seemingly simple robbery quickly turns into a complicated hostage situation when a dozen or so of the most prominent church members unexpectedly show up on the scene.

""First Friday"" does elicit a few hearty laughs, due, in large part, to its game cast and the occasional funny line scattered in and amongst the numerous clunkers.  Ice Cube effectively plays straight man to Tracy Morgan`s endearingly bumbling sidekick, and they, together with the other actors, help to comprise a fine comic ensemble.  The problem lies in a screenplay which often goes for the obvious joke over something truly original or clever, and which pours on the syrup to alarming proportions near the end just to ensure the movie its status as a morally upright, ""feel-good"" comedy.

It's a harmless enough little diversion if you have some time to kill, but the company is far more appetizing than what it is they`re dishing up.",1216252800,6,1256,4.841121495327103

But as you go into the movie, you cannot help but laugh especially at Katt Williams. That Katt stole the movie from them guys. But one of the best performances there was one of Olivia Cole. Throughout the time when Cube and Tracy was at that church, she didn't waver or back away, and when stuff got down to the nitty gritty, she gave one of the best speeches in the whole movie. Chi McBride was just as good as the minister. Though it had it's silly moments, I liked it.",1215302400,,581,4.105263157894737

I enjoyed the movie but it was a comedy with a serious tone as far as Ice Cubes child in the movie. The comedy itself as I said was mainly from Katt Williams whereas Ice and Tracy just seemed to set up a joke for Katt to do his thing.

If only more men would stop, take stock of what is most important in life and work towards doing everything in their power to create stronger bonds for their children (especially boy children), we would have a brighter future to look forward to.

3368628,4,B0014QLEIQ,"I know people do not look for messages in films of this type. I see a lot of people expected a comedy when it was a combination of that plus drama. Presumptions that Ice Cube, Tracy Morgan plus Katt Williams and their prior work in comedies made this film fall on bad reviews. I thought those pre-conceived notions hurt this film from getting the props it deserved. Being a Talbert supporter for many years, this was not a 5 star but 4 is close enough. I would have wanted it to have actually been filmed here in Baltimore. Then, maybe it would have not looked as if it were shot elsewhere, which it showed badly.

I had fun with the film and the message it left. It was all about salvation, redemption, forgiveness and self-worth. We live in harsh times and this movie showed the depth of what one would do to survive. It happens everyday and at anytime but this flick added the real and the humorous view when the news @ 9 shows the horrific. I plan on purchasing the DVD for the extras no doubt. Katt Williams was a lil over used but his parts were truly hilarious. Having seen another version of this film... I can't wait to own it.",1212105600,,1136,4.308411214953271
