2922646,1,B000UNYJWM,"Hmmmm, this movie looks very familiar. It resembles that other movie about golf. You know the one that came out in 1980? Only difference is that movie was funny and this one is flat out boring.

Plot: C-Note(Big Boi of Outkast) is a rich rapper who wants to join a golf club but the snooty owner Cummings(Jeffrey Jones) refuses to let C-Note and his pals join the club. C-Note does everything in his power to piss off Cummings and later on challenges him to a golf tournament.

Opinion: Doesn't that plot remind you of that movie with Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield and that silly gopher? This movie has other problems besides it being a ripoff of Caddyshack. You're sitting there waiting for a laugh and it never comes. Big Boi is not funny and the movie relies too much on fart jokes and cliches. Jeffrey Jones is overacting to the extreme just like he did in Howard The Shmuck. Sheri Shepard plays a caricature of a black woman and as a matter of fact the majority of the actors in this movie are caricatures. You know a movie is in trouble when you have Andy Milonakis in it! And the scene where Faizon  Love and the rest of those guys are baring their naked buns in the locker room is not funny, its just sick. Almost as sick as Rip Torn shaking his naked bottom in Freddy Got Fingered. If you're looking for a laugh look elsewhere. Who's Your Caddy is 100% laugh-free. A certified double bogey.",1212624000,3,1401,4.443579766536965

I WOULD RECOMMENED THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH.",1200787200,3,318,4.096774193548387
2922648,3,B000UNYJWM,"This movie is full of outlandish behavior and over the top scenes while following a shadowy storyline about a man trying to protect his father's legacy.  I have to admit that there were several funny scenes, but most of the humor is crude and not very tasteful.  The movie is enjoyable enough, but you definitely won't be changed by this movie.
The Basics: a wealthy rapper C Note (Big Boi) attempts to purchase a membership to a country club, his application is denied, he purchases a home adjacent to the country club and ends up owning part of the club's golf course.  It is later revealed the club record is held by his father, but is not honored because his father was a caddy and not a member of the club. C Note fights to make sure his father's legacy is honored.
Watching this movie will definitely not raise your I.Q, but its bearable.",1198627200,,844,4.467532467532467

This movie would have gotten a higher rating but it is so much a take off of Caddy Shack it's almost a clone but with a Hip Hop artist replacing Rodney Dangerfield.  Probably more popular in the black community as the Hip Hop artist gets it over on the ""The Man"".  Funny portrail of the nerdy son of the club's president trying to be cool.  Some people just aren't cool.  The kid is funny.  A very attractive black female attorney adds to the eye appeal along with the booty dancers.  This one is done well enough to keep in my video library.  A very funny film that sadly looses on creativity as a Caddy Shack clone.  Worth the buy, however.",1370476800,,727,4.279411764705882

""Who's Your Caddy?"" is a story about a peaceful community and a loud group who's about to bring the house down.  There's a very exclusive country club owned by a sexless, pompous, agitated, bigoted rich man, played by Jeffery Jones. His prestigious lifestyle got interrupted when an unwelcomed guest approached him for membership, a top-hollerin' egotistical rap star named C-Note (Big Boi).  He and his posse recently bought an estate near the country club, and all he wanted was to join, but the guy from ""Ferris Bueller"" is too white and bigoted to accept.  Once C-Note made the club president's life a living hell through extravagant and unrealstically comical means, he got the membership and decided to get crunked up with his usual flair of booze and booty-shakers.  The club president tried to stop him with a black female lawyer, but she eventually gazed her eyes on the rapper like moth to a predictable character flame. No matter how he tried to one-up the brotha, C-Note and his crew kept sabotaging him in every step of the way, which all ended in a big tournament over who owns the country club.

A loud-and-obnoxious black man trying to bring down a rich whitey?  That premise sounds a lot like the material ""The Boondocks"" used as a parody, except this movie is being completely straightforward; that's not good.  It's kinda depressing that these series of asinine ebony-catering jokes could've been avoided had the club president let the rapper be a member and be at peace.  In fact, the movie established that C-Note is a college graduate, he could've persuaded the club president by intellectual means.  His crew happened to be multi-cultural with a few white people on his side, and he even helped Andy Milinokis gained confidence and be cool, so he's very open-minded with others; he even had a talented white dude as his caddy, who I have to admire for his bravery and high tolerance for all the stuff his crew had to dish out, even Faizon Love for making him sniff his finger from wherever he used it on.  I noticed Terry Crews's making his brief appearance, and he could've had more time for better laughs than anything Faizon Love's fat repulsive butt could dish out; heck, get rid of Faizon Love altogether, and this movie would get my rating of approval.

The point is, ""Who's Your Caddy?"" had the potential to not suck.  But it resorted to the lowest common denomination of stereotypical black antics that almost made it close to being as bad as ""Soul Plane"".  A couple of things about the movie really bothered me, particularly the polo and golf matches.  C-Note and his gang broke plenty of rules in those games, like Faizon on foot pushing some guy off his hose and hit the ball towards the post in Polo and disturbing a golfer's concentration by yelling and blowing gas, and yet they somehow win those matches; they even stoop low as to feed their enemy's horse with illicit substances.  They're just as bad as the rich guy they're trying to bring down, and I hated how cocky and overconfident they acted for most of the movie.  I doubt this is the story Our Stories Films really wanted to make, but a quick cash-grab for its targeted demographic in order to acquire extra dough; too bad it tanked at the box-office.",1282435200,,3264,4.708260105448154
2922747,1,B000UNYJWM,"Not funny; poorly written; waste of talent; even the poignant theme was lost amidst potty-nonhumor. If I could rate this movie with a negative10 stars, I would. Please don't waste your money and encourage this mess.",1272758400,2,215,5.0

2922749,4,B000UNYJWM,"Stop Being So Serious!  If intellectual stimulous was my only motivation for viewing movies I'd shoot myself.  ""Who's Your Caddy"" is hillarious.  The humor is base, raunchy and politically incorrect and offers a great escape from the everyday rigor that we all face.  Does it offer Academy Award caliber performance?  Not even close.  Did it make me feel good?  Yeah, it did that big time.",1271376000,3,389,4.892307692307693
2922750,5,B000UNYJWM,This movie kept me laughing through out. great movie to add to your comedy colection. It is a movie that you will watch more then once.,1251676800,,135,4.230769230769231
2922751,2,B000UNYJWM,"In ""Who's Your Caddy?,"" a bad-ass rap star by the name of C-Note (Big Boi) attempts to gain entree to an East Coast country club so swanky and exclusive that it won't even admit Bill Clinton in as a member.

As a fish-out-of-water and stick-it-to-the-elitists culture-clash comedy, ""Who's Your Caddy?"" is neither particularly original nor particularly funny, but it's a harmless enough trifle, I suppose, and Jeffrey Jones is a real hoot as the put-upon board president who does everything he can to sabotage C-Note's efforts.

Frankly, though, when all is said and done, it's the gorgeous autumnal scenery that's the real star of the film.",1250380800,,640,5.028301886792453
2922752,5,B000UNYJWM,"not only did this movie make me laugh so hard i fell off the couch in tears, but the service was excellent. thank you for your promptness!",1241740800,,138,4.148148148148148
2922753,4,B000UNYJWM,"I actually really enjoyed this movie!

I thought the casting was excellent, the exchanges funny and the plot able to keep my attention on the screen (I have ADD, so huge accomplishment);

Then again, I've never seen Caddyshack, so maybe that's why I can't compare these two.

On the bad side;
- Too many fart-jokes

And that's about it.
If you can make your peace with that, I suggest you give this movie a shot.

A 'fight for what's yours' story with a lot of heart, dressed up as a golf-comedy.",1235174400,,496,4.406593406593407
2922754,5,B000UNYJWM,"If you are looking for a movie that will make you fall out of your chair with laughter and tears in your eyes.....look no further.
