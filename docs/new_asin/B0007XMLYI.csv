Being a Upstairs Downstairs, and Forsyte Fan, this fit right in with the others.
It wasn't the best quality of filming - but was fine considering what was available at the time.
I had a marathon weekend and watched the entire series.  I do believe that if you purchase the non UK edition, and have some of the ""politics"" cut out, it would not be the same.  I learned more about the UK system of politics, which I followed into researching more to verify.  I do recommend this set.
