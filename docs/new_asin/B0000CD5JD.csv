1918564,4,B0000CD5JD,"Hammy Hamster is a Canadian production which has produced the series at three different times using real animals such as hamsters, mice, guinea pigs and so on. The first series filmed in black and white during the infancy of television, the second in the early 70s and only a few years ago. It is fascinating even for today's child who live in an era of compouter generated images. This series allows their inagination to come fully alive. It was magical for me in the mid 1970s!",1132185600,4,479,4.5813953488372094
1918565,4,B0000CD5JD,"The big plus for this dvd is that it uses real animals instead of the animation we've come to rely on. For my 2-1/2 year old nephew, I think seeing a story with real live animals was a new and interesting thing. Though I found it rather boring, I'm rating it 4 stars for its apparent appeal to little kids.",1116028800,,306,4.116666666666666

7998939,3,B0000CD5JD,"This is cute if you've never seen the original version from England made in the 1960's.  But it is more modern and contains annoying and long winded commentary before each short.  Not as charming.  The problem is, we ordered the original version but it only plays on our laptop and not on the TV.",1389139200,2,296,4.444444444444445
7998940,5,B0000CD5JD,"I began watching Hammy when it first came on TV --- I think nearly 30 years ago! I love animals and was fascinated from the very beginning with how well they enter-acted with each other, and how well the script was written. I think I was their biggest fan---they never failed to enthrall me, and I ordered all the videos---I own every episode on VHS tape. When there is extra stress in my life (and there is plenty of it at age 83) I still watch a Hammy episode before going to sleep! I believe folks from every generation can enjoy Hammy-Time! I wish cable would re-run the whole series. . . .

7998941,5,B0000CD5JD,"It is hard to find a good show for young children that doesn't have crudeness. These dvds are not crude in any way, and even better- they are highly imaginative!!!  The Hammy tales are perfect for young children.  My kids love animals and love that the Hammy, turtle, GP( the guinea pig) and Martha the mouse all get along and have fun (and inventive) adventures.  One of my three children has Autism, and doesn't like conflict, yelling, or other loud sounds that are unexpected.  This is one series he will watch over and over again!  I highly recommend the entire series!!!",1304121600,6,575,4.653465346534653
