7976586,4,B00007GZYB,"Linda Thorson was an acceptable Diana Rigg replacement in her own right however, the nature of the writing and plots changed and took on a
""sillier ""less serious aspect.  It actually became a somewhat parody of itself !  Would have to say that Diana Rigg ""owned"" the role and the chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee  was unbeatable !!  After their episodes the ""new"" Avengers was like a new series and while entertaining , is not up to the Rigg/Macnee episodes .",1500508800,,474,4.674698795180723

7976591,5,B00007GZYB,I am a big Avengers fan. I grew up watching this series. Its great to finally get it on DVD.,1219017600,,92,3.65
7976592,4,B00007GZYB,"Thingumajig and Pandora are very good. Requiem is extremely annoying in spots, and Bizarre is way too silly,especially in the brief Benny Hill-type girl chasing shots. Sorry this review is short, but I'm not much of a Linda Thorson fan.",1181088000,,236,4.925
7976593,5,B00007GZYB,"The electrifying bend of action, fantasy and espionage ends with acid guitar music in Paradise Plots. It starts with ""Thingumajig"" filmed in Jauary 1969 which is a parody to a Hammer film. This is the swan song of the Avengers at it's wildest. If you want to watch killer electric boxes knocked out by champagne this is the place baby! Seven different shows lasting six hours and four mintues with Steed and King in the original British TV cult classic the The Avengers.",1140652800,4,470,4.674698795180723
7976594,5,B00007GZYB,"These original Avengers are what entertainment should be.  Witty, urbane and highly entertaining, this last set is definitely a keeper.  I only regret that there are not more in the works.  This set is great for anybody who would like to spend an evening of quality television programming.",1044748800,8,289,4.979166666666667
