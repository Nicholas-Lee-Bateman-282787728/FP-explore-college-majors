754731,2,6303985394,"I can sum up this movie in one word, ""wierd"".  I first saw ""The Giant Gila Monster"" late at night as part of a local t.v. station's Godzilla Monster Week (no, the giant lizard in this film is of no relation to the King of the Monsters).  I remember being disappointed after having stayed up late only to find that they were showing a monster movie that had absolutely nothing to do with Godzilla, but after having watched the movie I thought it was actually pretty good.  Of course I was only about 5 years old at the time, and for me, 11:00 p.m. really was pretty late at night.
Anyway, I just purchased a copy of this movie last week, and watched it (actually half watched - I kept falling asleep) this afternoon.  I knew that it probably wouldn't be as good as I thought it was nearly 20 years ago, but I didn't think it would be quite as lame as it is.
Granted it's a 50's B sci-fi flick, so you know it's going to be extremely wild, cheesy and campy - after all, that's what makes those movies so great.  Even though this film does have its ""wild"" scenes, and it definitely is cheesy all the way through, and it is extremely campy - there's just something that keeps this one from being one of the classics of its kind.  It's probably the fact that aside from the giant lizard's attacks (if you want to call them attacks), the rest of the movie is just plain boring.
It starts out rather promising, with a giant reptile monster claw coming down violently upon a car with a couple teenagers inside, sending the car hurling over the side of a hill.  Then the title comes up - ""The Giant Gila Monster"" - followed by the opening credits and some creepy background music.  It's all downhill from that point on, though.  The rest of the film centers around a small Texas town in the late 50's that seems to be populated by a bunch of rednecks, a semi-intelligent sheriff, a bunch of dancing teenagers, and our hero - an Elvis wannabe who lives at home with his ""slightly cooler than June Cleaver"" mom, his crippled daughter, and his ""at times"" annoying foreign girlfriend.  Oh yeah, occasionally he gets to take breaks from his ""hectic"" life to play some extremely cheesy folk tunes on a toy banjo!  By the way, I happen to like ""real"" folk music, but these songs just made me want to vomit!
Anyway, now on to the real star of the movie - the giant terrifying Gila Monster!! Yawn.  The only thing that seems to be menacing about this overgrown lizard is his enormous size.  The only way he actually brings destruction are the times when he happens to be crossing the road and cars smash in to him, or the time when he walks under a rail road bridge and ends up causing the train to wreck simply because he's too big to fit under the bridge!  Out of the about 10 ""attacks"" the lizard makes throughout the film, only 2 were actually done on purpose!  Certainly there was little for these backward citizens to actually fear from this abnormally large reptile.  One thing that certainly surprised me when watching this movie is that the fact that real life gila monsters are venomous was not even mentioned in the film.  Some monster!
All right, now that I've talked your ear off about this movie, decide if you really want to watch it or not, and then wait for it to come on late night t.v.  I certainly wouldn't want anyone else to make the mistake I did of purchasing it.  I wouldn't even suggest renting it, there are certainly better ways of spending a couple bucks.",988502400,7,3466,4.379095163806552

The effects aren't bad for 1959 (the models the normal Gila Monster tromps across are fairly good). The scene where the Gila Monster breaks into the barn actually looks pretty darned good. An oversized reptile is a lot more likely than giant ants (even though I love Them! and its a great film) of a vulture the size of a B-52 (The Giant Claw is really a terrible movie). The period music and the period hot rods are nice to hear and see.

Want more Gila Monsters spend all their time underground where it is cooler and only come out about three weeks a year. Too bad the writers did not take advantage of the fact that this critter is poisonous.

THE GIANT GILA MONSTER (1959) has a no-name cast, a laughable story and a Mexican lizard standing in for the titled critter.

BTW, ""Gila"" ans ""Shrews"" were created to be seen as a double feature. The horror! The horror! (to quote Col. Kurtz)

Maybe it's the charming, anachronistic relationships between the folks in the little town with each other and their Sheriff. Maybe it's the simple, uncomplicated, and rather forthright behavior of everyone in the movie.  I dunno. It just kind of drew me in and, in spite of myself, I was actually enjoying the darn thing. I bought it in a horror movie collection along with 49 other old movies (that was not a typo) at Sam's Club for about fifteen bucks.

And, sure, the Gila Monster itself wasn't very convincing, but -- for what it was, with the technology used -- it actually wasn't so unbelievable after all.  It's so strange that I watched ""The Blob"" on the TCM channel just yesterday, and although it was a far better film than ""Gila Monster"", both movies struck an oddly similar, sweet old chord in this jaded, cynical 21st Century man.

755221,2,6303985394,"The Giant Gila Monster, 1959 film

There is a large area where no man ever goes in the southwest desert. We see a couple in an old coupe; something happens and their car goes down a hill. Young people enter a malt shop [no windows?]. What's new? Where's Pat and Liz? Nobody seems to worry about their future. They all go to a drive-in theater. The missing couple is reported to the Sheriff by Mr. Willard (the powerful figure in the area). One mechanic offers to tune up the Sheriff's car. The talk tells about the people and the times. We see a small farmhouse where Liz Humphrey lives. Chase works all the angles. A car is found wrecked in the ditch (a new Pontiac). Blood but no bodies? Chase liberates a new headlamp. A hitch0hiker gets an unpleasant surprise. A Cadillac speeds and goes into the ditch. Chase pounds out a fender to repair a dent. $2 for repairs. Two twenties!

Teenagers search for the missing couple in a ravine. A lizard searches too. A car horn calls them back. The wrecker pulls out the missing car, no bodies found. An old man and his car have an accident! Chase's little sister can walk with braces! [A reference to the polio epidemics of that era.] Another car wreck, where is the driver? Livestock have gone missing too. [No tracks in the dirt?] Will a bridge be damaged? Something strange happened. Travis saw the wreck. The Sheriff reads a book on lizards. Stories about giants? The story will be squelched, they don't want people to panic. Teenagers dance at a party, a DJ from station KILT appears to play music. Willard complains about the two whitewall tires. Who sang that song? What can go wrong now? ""Don't panic!"" The Sheriff shoots to drive it away. [Did they need a license for nitro?] Chase follows the trail and aims his car at the monster. Mission accomplished! Everybody is alright. There will be a happy ending for Chase now.

This must be the lowest budget film from that era. It is not a bad movie, it follows the formula. A monster arrives in town to threaten the people, but they gather and eliminate the threat. This kind of story goes back to Beowulf. These low-budget movies were fodder for the low-end drive-in theaters that provided entertainment for millions.

755283,3,6303985394,"THE GIANT GILA MONSTER (1959) is a less-than-memorable clone of 1958's THE BLOB, which still ranks as one of the best ""Radiation Is Coming To Get Us"" pictures.

This is not one of the best. It should be better than it is, and it isn't quite bad enough to make the One-and-One-Half-Star Five Star Movie category. THE GIANT GILA MONSTER lacks the suspense of THE BLOB. The monster is nowhere as interesting, much less threatening, and hardly dangerous. The Special Effects aren't very special. The characterizations range from wooden and lifeless to absurdly hokey. Still, this is worth watching if for no other reason that it's hokey lead character is so nauseatingly endearing. It is also, for its time, surprisingly sympathetic to people with disabilities.

In THE GIANT GILA MONSTER, a giant gila monster terrorizes a small town in the Southwest. Just like THE BLOB, the GIANT GILA MONSTER focuses on a bunch of civic-minded small-town Sideburners who discover the existence of the monster. The adults in town (including the predictably obtuse Sheriff) don't believe the Sideburners (who tool around in some really cool modified Detroit Iron and speak Beatnik---just like THE BLOB).

And just like THE BLOB, the local teens are led by an impossibly good guy, Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan), who became the Man of The Family after his father died in an industrial accident. Chase is taking correspondence courses to further his education. He is friends with the Sheriff who trusts him to keep his hot-rodding buddies in line. He's working as a Mechanic's Helper to earn money to support his widowed Mom and to help pay for the leg braces his little sister needs after having had polio. He writes and sings corny pop songs in his free time. The film tries to promote the marginally-talented Sullivan's musical career, so we get to hear them. You'll need insulin. Think ""Elvis Sings Perry Como."" In other words, he's just so All-American that you have to wonder if he's a Soviet secret agent. Oh, and he figures out how to kill the giant gila monster.

755284,3,6303985394,"I have not seen this in perhaps 45 years, when we would watch movies every afternoon, often with '50s monsters in them.  This one has a gila monster walking around models, with a group of near-amateur actors.  For the most part, it is a teen monster film, with a few adults checking in on occasion.  Though the acting is a bit stilted, the script is pretty lively, particularly the town drunk who happens to turn up whenever something is happening with jokes and stumbles around.  The background of the movies is also good, with clunky pre-1960s rock, rebellious but respectful, earnest kids with short hair, and no swearing whatsoever.  The main character, a mechanic who is taking engineering courses by correspondence, is quite charming and adds a lot with some pretty good singing.  He is the soul of the film.

In terms of plot, people start disappearing, though their cars turn up banged out of shape after swerving strangely off the road.  The sheriff starts questioning the mechanic kid, who is very helpful and, it turns out, courageous.  While there is no explanation like ""radiation"" built into the plot, the wonder if a lizard ""with a pituitary out of whack"" got it to grow.  At risk to himself, the hero solves things, his crippled sister gets the leg braces she needs, and his French girlfriend survives.

755285,4,6303985394,"With Sid's horrorfest at film number 18 we decided to go with a movie in true Mystery Science Theater 3000 style with The Giant Gila Monster. Coming from 1959 it proves to be something very different for Sid. Sure we've enjoyed sporadic clips over the years from these style films where giant animals or bugs take on a city, but have never actually watched one from start to finish. We figured there was no better time to give it a shot then during our 31 days of horror or in this case comedy. This will also give old St. Nick the spotlight as this one will be the Santa pick of the Month being that it's right up his alley of black and white films. It's the type you'll here ""oh baby!"" come from his lair.

We start off with a small quiet town in Texas that get's terrorized by a giant lizard, well actually a normal sized lizard just zoomed in on the make it look huge. When a group of extremely polite teens so up missing for a sock hop their buddies immediately contact the authorities. Mind you the dialogue from this movie is absolutely hilarious in true family guy ""fast talking, high trousers"" fashion. The adults think the kids are pulling some type of slickster prank at first and dismiss their story about the giant reptile. Once the sheriff gets involved and realizes this kids are telling the truth they set forth on a seek and destroy mission with ""Great Success!"" They decided to take on of the kids hot rods and attach explosives to drive into the monster destroying it on contact. Just fantastic stuff!

Usually these films don't appeal to us unless they're being watched on an MST3K basis, but this one was simply hilarious. It shows us that we may be missing a great piece of b cinema in our weekly routine. When you really focus on B then you have to realize the 50's is really what got the ball rolling. Plus the dialogue is right up Sid's alley in the way we'll joke around from time to time, so you really can't miss with that. For us the film was classic and hilarious with no frills. There are no special effects to be found outside of a few very dull explosions and a toy train set derailing attempting to look like a real train. And that's exactly what we loved about it.

755287,3,6303985394,"I have been a MST3K fan since the very early days, but ""The Giant Gila Monster"" is a painful experience punctuated by zingers from Joel and the Bots. The movie is a black and white film from 1959 that revolves around teenagers, the world's most incompetent sheriff, and a Mexican Beaded Lizard standing in for the Giant Gila Monster.

The bulk of the film revolves around the sheriff and his peculiar co-dependency with a teenage tow truck driver. There are subplots about an angry oil tycoon, a girl with braces on her legs (which gives rise to an absolutely syrupy and nearly unbearable ukulele-intensive musical number; if you like it, don't worry, it's reprised a second time), a dance in a barn, a giant lizard, and of course, a lot of model train scenery.

Despite the MST3K treatment, I found watching this to be a chore: the dialogue is so muddy, that it's frequently impossible to understand what's being said, and the picture is grainy and even more horrible than many period films of the genre.

To relieve some of the pain, there is a bit of new material from Joel, Trace, and Frank in character explaining a bit about copyright law. This was by far the best part of the DVD. There are also some interviews and still photos, which are entertaining. This film is now part of the MST3K 10.2 box set, but if you order it by itself it comes clad in a cardboard DVD sleeve.

While I love MST3K, this is not one of the stronger episodes, although it's nice to see a Joel episode for a change. This one gives ""Hamlet"" a run for its money for the title of most boring MST3K episode.

755352,3,6303985394,"This movie is worth watching for several reasons.  First, this movie actually had a somewhat plausible plot.  Second, many of the Gila monster scenes were well done.  Third, Fred Graham and Shug Fisher are in this movie; more on them in a moment.

There were many movies made for drive-in theaters that featured teenagers in weak plots with a poorly costumed actor as the monster.  These movies were cheesy, but many of the teens that went to the drive-in were not really there to see the movie anyway, so everyone was happy.  However, some of these movies actually tried hard to present a relatively coherent story and featured a plausible monster.  This movie is one of those.

The monster in this case is a huge Gila monster.  The movie glosses over the source of the monster, but the movie uses a genuine Gila monster on various miniature sets that generally match the full-sized locations in appearance.  My only disappointment was that the Gila monster never appeared in the same frame as any of his victims.

Gila Monsters make poor actors.  In one scene I could see that someone was pushing the Gila monster forward because sand was piling up in front of the Gila monster's legs.  In another scene the Gila monster breaks through a wall, but the Gila monster appeared more enthusiastic about getting unstuck than breaking through the wall.  I felt sorry for the Gila monster.

Our human actors are principally teenagers.  The teenagers in this case are good kids who are generally misunderstood.  There is more than a little conflict between characters because Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham, a veteran actor of more than 200 films, including ""Wake of the Red Witch,"" ""The Horse Soldiers,"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"") is supportive of the misunderstood teenagers in opposition to wealthy Mr. Wheeler who believes the sheriff is incompetent and the teenagers are a bunch of hoodlums.  The lead teenager is Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan, who also appeared in ""Teenage Zombies"" and ""The Monster of Piedras Blancas"") who sings several songs in the movie and has a sister who gets braces for her legs so that we have a bit of ""aww"" factor in this movie, especially when the Gila monster chases the sister in her leg braces.  One of Chase's songs is passable, but I fast-forwarded through all of them.

The Gila monster makes regular appearances throughout the movie.  There is the dramatic claw shot; there are the ominous Gila monster in the brush shots; and then there is the ever-popular Gila monster under the railroad bridge shot.  This Gila monster is multi-talented.  As is often the case in monster movies, most of the major characters do not know there is a monster lurking about until about two-thirds of the way into the movie.  Once everyone finally realizes there is a giant Gila monster munching its way through the local population, including some passengers of a wrecked train, the sheriff and the teenagers are galvanized into action!  The excitement builds as the Gila monster threatens a dance, which somehow includes Chase Winstead's boss Old Man Harris (played by Shug Fisher, a member of Sons of the Pioneers, who sang with Roy Rogers, and a veteran of many movies including ""My Pal Trigger,"" ""Mr. Roberts"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"") and then attempts to eat Chase's polio stricken sister as she runs in her new braces.  Will the excitement ever end!

This movie is a study in contrasts.  On the one hand the movie has very weak special effects.  For example, the train scenes used film from at least two different trains, and maybe three.  Also, the model train that wrecked was a poor match for the actual train used in the shots leading up to the wreck.  While some of the scenes of the Gila monster were nicely done, others looked exactly like what they were, a genuine Gila monster walking around (or being pushed) on the ground.

On the other hand, the movie does play as a serious movie.  The movie painted the teenagers as being a bit too goody-goody, but otherwise everyone acted reasonably typical for the era and the teenage parts of the movie refrained from the over-the-top nonsense that plagued many other teen movies of the era.  I also admit that when I was a kid I thought this movie was really scary.  I was probably ten at the time but I was impressed!

If you like old monster movies from the 1950's and 1960's, this one is certainly worth a watch.  I have this one in my collection because I liked it when I was young and because it was cheap.  It is also great for a Friday or Saturday night watch on a Halloween weekend or on New Year's weekend instead of letting a television programmer decide what you are going to watch.

No explanation is ever given as to where the lizard came from or why or how no one saw something that was big enough to derail a train with its head.

There is too much time spent on the main character and his problems and little spent on creating any actual tension with the lizard. The effects are what you would expect, a regular sized lizard walking aimlessly around a miniature set with weird music playing to let you know to be terrified. There are also two interludes where our hero sings. He isn't talented, even though the movie tries to tell you he is. The songs are terrible, have nothing to do with the movie and you will be praying for them to end.

The tagline for this film was: ""Only Hell could breed such an enormous beast. Only God could destroy it!"" But this 1959 film from director Ray Kellogg (""The Killer Shrews,"" ""The Green Berets""--how is that for a credit combo?), filmed in north Texas for $138,000, is a lot more low-keyed than those lines would suggest. In fact, what is interesting given when this film is made is the key relationship between Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham) and young Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan). The kid is working on his hot rod and instead of busting his chops the sheriff really functions as a mentor: he says he is concerned about the kids in town, and you actually believe it. The idea of having a movie in which a teenage hot rodder, who also sings like Pat Boone who is not a juvenile delinquent, or at least treated like one by the cops, is rather refreshing, although admittedly the character is a bit heavy on the saccharine. But Sullivan has a natural charm and the guy wrote his own songs, so give him some credit.

But since we are talking letting a Gila monster wander through miniatures in a film with teenage hot rodders, of course this movie received ""MST3K"" treatment (Season 4, when Joel turned Crow and Servo into ""The Thing With Two Heads"" as inspired by the movie of the same name""). My major complaint about this film is that the day for night shooting is so dark I have a hard time figuring out what is happening. Obviously the special effects budget is such that most of the ""horror"" is suggested by quick cuts rather than actually showing everything. Still, I like the way that everybody is pretty level headed in this film and deal with the giant Gila monster in a relatively intelligent manner without wasting a lot of time and effort. Yes, finding the monster, which is the size of several houses, should not take so long, but then the movie would be shorter and it is only 74 minutes anyway.

Gee, I hardly know which one to recommend. Or you can go for a triple feature of ""The Killer Shrews"" ""The Giant Gila Monster,"" and ""Human Gorilla.""

755429,3,6303985394,"Monster movies of the 50's either take place in a crowded metropolitan city or in a tiny town in the desert. In the former, the monster of the hour can run amuck squashing any number of cars, wrecking buildings, and standing up very well to a barrage of weapons aimed at it.

In the latter, the ""destruction"" is usually minimal. Instead, we have innocent teenagers or senior citizens being picked off one by one until others in the area realize that ""something is wrong.""

It is this remoteness factor, I believe, that makes for a better movie. I think most people can relate to how they would feel if they were on their own fighting an unknown creature--as compared to being part of a company of soldiers shooting machine guns at it.

""Giant Gila Monster"" is most definitly ""B"" movie material. The acting and writing are so-so. And that giant paw coming down on the hapless victims was rather silly. To complete the negative aaspects of this movie, the music was horrible. Whenever rock & roll music was being pretended to be played, what we heard was some generic jitterbug music. Perhaps the producers could not afford to pay the royalties to play Buddy Holly, Elvis, or the Everly Brothers. Whatever the reason, the record-playing music was good only compared to the ""live"" songs sung by the star of this movie.

The positive aspect about this movie is that in a strange way it was realistic. One might argue that nothing staring a ""giant gila monster"" could be ""realistic."" But consider that the monster did not go on a rampage of mindless and malicious destruction that is so often seen in other movies of its like. Instead, it caused death only because it was hungry--and nobody had instructed it not to eat people. And it caused destruction only because it was so large (too big to crawl under a train bridge, for example).

There are also some cool cars. I'm not much into pre-WWII cars and it was hard to believe that every teen in this movie seemed to own one. And the guy you ""love to hate"" drove a 1959 Caddy. Perfect automobile casting!",1113955200,,2050,4.605479452054794

755435,2,6303985394,"As we all know, some bad movies (PLAN NINE being the example always trotted out) are so bad that they are actually fun.  Their crudity, or cluelessness or sheer incompetence make them worthwhile.  THE GIANT GILA MONSTER almost makes it to this status, but alas, falls short due to some indefinable quality that takes it from camp to just plain boring.
Perhaps the main problem is that we just don't see enough of the monster.  In this small Texas town, the kids seem to have more interest in listenin' to that good ole rock 'n' roll!  And the rock songs are simply wretched...and too many.  More monster...less music!!  That's what this movie needs.
The special effects, such as they are, are below average for this time period, but not far enough below (a la ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN) to make them a laugh riot.  They're just obvious.  And I'm sorry, but a Gila Monster isn't a terribly threatening beast.  It's not quite as silly as a KILLER SHREW, though, so again, the movie fails to reach true camp status.
Students of what bad early rock 'n' roll could be, as conceived by Hollywood B-listers might get some amusement from this film...but if you like the old '50s monster movies, this ain't the one to hunt down.",1071792000,,1221,4.564220183486238
755436,2,6303985394,"The term 'campy' was probably intended to describe cheesy monster movies of the 50s like THE GIANT GILA MONSTER.  Horror films preceding this decade and following it have tried to scare audiences in a serious way, usually with middling success.  In the 50s however, the possibility of a nuclear holocaust convinced more than a few directors that a new and untrod direction in cinematic fear was needed.  This direction was to dump some truly ridiculous monsters on the screen, usually with dancing rock and rollers, and go for the cheap laughs.  Such a direction was undoubtedly facilitated by an equally cheap budget that did not allow for convincing special effects or a talented cast or gifted script writers.  Director Ray Kellog is typical of his contemporaries in that he presents a menace to mankind in which the monster's lethality is confined to a limited target population, either country bumpkin types or jitterbugging teens.  The 'monster' was either a giant reptile, as the Gila monster in this movie, or smaller and recognizable variants of known animals like the predatory shrews of THE KILLER SHREWS (also directed by Kellogg).  It is difficult to assume that Kellogg really believed that a sequence of shots with a lizard slithering around and through some toy mockups would scare anyone over the age of ten.  Far more likely is the belief that he wanted to use the non-existent fear factor as a blanket by which he could raise some threads and peek at an assortment of 50s style themes and fads.  It cannot be a coincidence that the scourge of rock and roll, which was thought by the stiff collar crowd to be the undermining of our youth, was loudly trumpted in nearly every third scene.  Don Sullivan, who plays the ukelele plunking hero, sings some truly awful songs that are meant to be a jibe at rock and roll but emerge more as an abortive aspirant to star in Hee Haw.  TGGM contains the usual range of cinematic cliches from the hayseed but earnest sheriff to the goofy teens (played by actors at least ten years olders than their parts) to a monster that leaves the audience truly gasping at its inept level of non-lethality.  As often was the case in this genre only the youthful protagonist could figure how to to slay the dragon.  The ending reminded me of that which often closed television juvenile shows of the era--the remaining cast gathered in a circle to hold hands and laugh, possibly to reassure us that the dragon has been banished, but more likely to indicate that they could hardly believe that anyone would pay the price of a ticket to see this one.",1067558400,,2590,4.741648106904232
755529,4,6303985394,"I first discovered the film, ""The Giant Gila Monster"" while watching Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the commentary given by the characters on the show really made this film funny, watching the film by itself also lent some humor.
The story centers around a small town that is ravaged by a giant gila monster that emerged from the desert. While the gila monster wreaks havoc on the town and the town's people, the audience is also treated to the singing of Don Sullivan, who plays the lead. While it was funny at first, by the end of the movie you'll want to scream if you have to hear the song, ""Laugh Children Laugh"" one more time!
All in all, I did like this movie. It's interesting to see the archaic special effects that were probably cutting edge back in 1959 and compare them to the out-of-this-world effects used now. For those of you who love those old, drive-in movies that are purely for entertainment this is the one for you!",1052784000,,941,4.541176470588235
755530,4,6303985394,"Everything about this movie says ""stinker,"" yet I just can't help but like it; I've watched it at least half-a-dozen times since my early teens and just don't get tired of it. As every Giant Gila fan must know, it was produced by Ken Curtis (deputy Festus Haggen on TV's Gunsmoke) and directed by Ray Kellogg (The Green Berets, My Dog Buddy) back-to-back with The Killer Shrews. The pedestrian script is by Jay Simms, who did much better with Shrews, Panic in Year Zero, and Creation of the Humanoids, and the repetitious 'eerie' soundtrack is courtesy of Jack Marshall (who penned the memorable Munsters' TV theme). While all the kids tool around in custom ""slingshots"" and mouth some nifty jive talk, Giant Gila is just too NICE to qualify as a (typically sleazy) JD/monster flick. Don Sullivan (Teenage Zombies, Monster of Piedras Blancas) stars as keen teen Chase Winstead, who's so virtuous and upstanding that he ought to be canonized. He's working in a garage to support his family, keeps his buddies in line (no dragging!), helps the sheriff search for missing gila victims, writes and sings religious pop songs, is taking a correspondence course in engineering, and saves his money to buy leg braces for his polio-stricken kid sister! It's enough to make you gag. He gets additional saint points because his dad died on an oil rig owned by wealthy jerk Mr. Wheeler, and he's also got a beautiful but annoying and nearly unintelligible French girlfriend (Lisa Simone). Fred Graham, veteran of numerous westerns and flyboy flicks, plays the understanding sheriff, and Shug Fisher (formerly a member of the Sons of the Pioneers vocal group, along with Curtis) provides some cornball 'comedy' as Old Man Harris, whose 1932 Model-A is lusted after by the hot-rodders. Ken Knox is amusing as hep-cat DJ ""Steamroller"" Smith (he's driving while completely smashed when we meet him, yet nobody seems too concerned). The giant gila monster itself just seems to be sitting on the sidelines (exactly where is never really clear), observing a lot, and looking very normal-sized (the ""effects"" crew obviously had no idea how to shoot miniatures properly). When it does do some attacking it never interacts with any of the live actors (the film lacks a single matte shot, or even a cheesy double-exposure a la Bert I. Gordon, that would have put the monster and humans in the same frame). Since Ray Kellogg was a former special photographic effects technician at 20th Century Fox, it's a mystery why the monster scenes here are so lackluster. As if all this weren't enough, Sullivan sings the utterly cringeworthy ""Laugh, Children, Laugh"" (with ukelele accompaniment) not once, but TWICE during the picture (imagine a really lame Ricky Nelson or Everlys tune), although his rock'n'roll number, spun by Smith at the climactic ""platter party,"" is fairly passable (it sounds like an Elvis ripoff). The gila monster gets to demolish a toy tanker truck and electric train, and is finally annihilated by Chase, naturally, who destroys his custom rod in the process. While never achieving greatness, Giant Gila Monster is a relatively painless 75 minutes of corn-fed schlock that should please fans of 1950s monster cheapies (and/or Green Acres).
Not as pristine as most Image/Wade Williams releases, Giant Gila Monster is still presented here in better overall shape than any video or DVD copy I've seen yet. The box says it's matted at 1.85:1, though by my calculations it's closer to 1.66:1 (1.70:1 to be exact) and anamorphically enhanced. Print quality is very good to excellent, generally exhibiting only light speckling, blemishing, and lining, although there are a few stretches where the speckling/blemishing is a bit heavier; not enough to be a major distraction, but noticeable. Otherwise, the black level, brightness, contrast, sharpness, and shadow/highlight detail are excellent throughout. The accompanying trailer is also matted to about 1.70:1 and looks fine except for some light to moderate speckling and lining. Additional extras include 12 chapter stops, five Wade Williams Collection trailers, and an Images Journal essay that's nearly as amusing as the movie, wherein Giant Gila Monster is discussed in scholarly terms more befitting a Bergman or Godard film. As is typical with this sort of thing the type is too small and condensed, making for difficult on-screen reading (at least on a 27"" monitor). For the extremely cost-conscious, Diamond's full-frame edition (paired with Killer Shrews) isn't absolutely terrible (physical damage is a bit worse, plus it's softer, darker, more contrasty, and generally lacking in detail), but if you want the best available transfer, this is it.",1029628800,26,4695,5.146596858638744
755531,2,6303985394,"One of the challenges of regularly viewing cheesy monster movies is knowing the difference between ""so bad, it's good,"" and just plain bad.  This movie is laughable, but is it intentionally so?  A normal-sized Gila monster crawls over miniature detailed sets, spreading death along a dry riverbed and the nearby highway.  It crushes toy cars and slithers over twigs pretending to be logs.  After knocking down a Lincoln-log railroad bridge, the creeping terror attacks a Lionel train.  By the way, did anyone notice that the diesel engine kept changing looks, not to mention directions?  Continuity issues aside, the movie lacks credible special effects.  There are no mixed shots showing live (i.e., non-toy) backgrounds contrasting size with the alleged giant lizard.  Instead, there are sporadic close-ups of a huge clawed-foot attacking the camera lens.  The teenagers are the community's early warning system that danger is afoot, but the authorities are skeptical.  Do you ever remember an old monster movie where the cops believed the kids the first time?  The director loves the ""knee-up"" school of acting.  Masculine legs are up on every desk, workbench, and fender in sight.  Good old boys while pondering sideways skid marks can think better this way, I guess.  Shug Fisher is around for laughs, but comic relief is a moot point in this movie.  Before Festus, Ken Curtis tried his hand at producing.  This flick and ""Attack of the Killer Shrews"" are the result.  The B&W photography, the sound quality, and other production values are typically low budget.  Sensible viewers beware! ;-)",1016582400,3,1597,5.171875
755532,4,6303985394,"I have both discs in this series and they are quite enjoyable.
The Wasp Woman benefits from a strong lead performance by Susan Cabot and The Giant Gila Monsterf benefits from... being unintentionally hilarious.
It's great to see the selection of Drive in clips for advertising and intermision and they are very well transferred (even better than the films).
The ""distorto"" sound is cute.
Here's where this series needs to improve:
More new (old) drive in clips, some are recycled from the previosu release.
Better transfers of the features. Although ""Wasp Woman"" shows a nice improvement over the other transfers of ""Gila Monster"", ""Giant Leeches"" and ""Screaming Skull""
Encode it so it's all one program. When you select The ""Night At The Drive In"" all the segments are on ""seperate tracks"". In other words, when one segment ends, the player has to search out the next segment (causing a pause in sound, most noticible when you have the distorto sound on).
Encode it so the DVD player can show the time. At present, there is no time code and that bugs me.
Keep the content same era oriented. In this case, the movies are from 1960, the cartoons seem to be from the 30's or early 40's. Most of the ads seems to be late 50's, early 60's and the intermission film has to be early 70's (it shows pictures of the moon landing, which took place in 69). Make volumes that have 50's films and exclusivly 50's clips, then others that have 60's and 70's films and clips. establish a verisimilitude that will help you believe you are time tripping to a drive in at the time period of the movie.
That also goes for the ""distorto sound"". Sometimes we hear comments from people inside the ""virtual car"" we are in. The comments seem too ironic and modern in tone. They don't talk like people from the era the movies are in. It's fun in an MST3K sort of way though.
This is a good series that has the potential to be something great. A really special way to see these B movie charms.
While they are thinking of ""concept discs"" over at Elite. They might also consider making a TV chiller theater style series. With vintage hosts and ads.

The ""Pic"" mosquito coils, ""Let's All Go to the Lobby"" (not really a drive-in short anyway), Chilly Dilly pickles...the list goes on.  For the price of these discs (they're up in Criterion territory, pricewise), I expected to at least get all-new material.
The other thing with both of the drive-in discs is that the film transfers are not so hot.  That's all I'll say; if you want details about grain, scratches, splices, etc., look up more detailed reviews on, say, Google, and you'll get the scoop.  The bottom line is that the source material and transfers are pretty cruddy.  Again, if Elite wants to put a price tag on their DVDs that is approximately the same as many Criterion DVDs, they need to pony up with quality and all-new material.

Neeedless to say, poor Janice gets hooked on the stuff and turns into a wasp creature that must kill.  Also featuring Barboura Morris and Fred Eisley.
