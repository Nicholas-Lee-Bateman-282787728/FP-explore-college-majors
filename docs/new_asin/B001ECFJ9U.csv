8297704,1,B001ECFJ9U,"Wow - what a truly horrendous movie, filled with such bad acting and completely silly situations. Isn't there supposed to be an ethical standard between a lawyer and her client? So the lawyer is sleeping with her client - and a married one at that?

SPOILER WARNING!!*** do not read further if you don't want the end to be spoiled.

I can think of few movies that have ended so stupidly. At the end the cops pull in and arrest the guy AGAIN. What for? He was already tried and found not guilty of a host of crimes. What exactly are they arresting him for this time and what could they possibly charge him with? Double jeopardy means that he cannot be tried at all for any of the crimes he was charged with and went to trial for. Molly Ringwald's acting was truly atrocious. Her eye movements and over acting was truly painful to watch. The entire courtroom response to every revelation was pitiful. People's other facial expressions were equally laughable.

If you just want to kill off some hours of your life then go ahead and watch this crap. At least these actors made some money making it and it kept paying their bills, that is about all the good this movie did. The one thing it didn't do was entertain or challenge the mind in any way. But hey, it was a lifetime movie and I did have a couple hours to kill.",1276646400,,1315,4.337398373983739
