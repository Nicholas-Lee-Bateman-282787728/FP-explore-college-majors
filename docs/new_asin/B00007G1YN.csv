1808998,5,B00007G1YN,"This is one of the best Scooby Doo movies I've ever seen. The Yowie Yahoo had excellent graphics,and the three vampire minions that got kidnapped by the Yowie Yahoo a year ago were so cool. Casey Kasem is doing the voice of Scooby Doo. In the end the villans were unmasked and the Yowie Yahoo turned out to be a holograhic projection added with explosions. This movie is worth buying.",1048291200,,384,4.5
1808999,5,B00007G1YN,This is one of the best Scooby Doo movies I've ever seen the huge Yowie Yahoo atttacking all the rock bands with his three minions{rock band that came third in last years festival}.the Hex girls are back from the witches ghost. Wait till you see the gang play rock music! This movie is a must to Scooby Doo fans all around the world.,1048204800,,333,4.301587301587301
1809000,5,B00007G1YN,"Being a tremendous Scooby fan and in partcular, being partial to the ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" series. I thought this was a fantastic DVD. What makes it bittersweet for me however is that all of the original voice actors have returned with the exception of one - the late great Don Messick, who was the one and only voice of Scooby until his death in 1997. I'm sure Mr. Messick would have loved to have been involved in such a great and nostalgic Scooby Doo project.",1048118400,,468,4.390804597701149
1809001,5,B00007G1YN,"Well, we've had this DVD for eight days now, and my 4-year-old has requested it each day since purchase.  He is certainly loving the mystery gang, and I must admit that I find it highly watchable (even after the 8th time).  For me, one of the more enjoyable aspects of it is the return to the ""classic"" characters, with everyone in original clothes -- Fred has his ascot, Daphne has her purple tights, etc. -- and, of course, the original voices.  Nobody compares to Casey Kasem.  For my 4-year-old, however, he just likes the vampires and ""the part where Scooby gets eaten by the crocodile.""",1047859200,,592,4.609523809523809
1809002,3,B00007G1YN,"The term classic is over used. When Disney can claim that such poorly produced product as Return of Jafar is a classic Disney cartoon, well, the term is being used loosely. Scooby Doo fits right in that category. Hey, I grew up watching the original series and, while it was fun then, it hasn't aged all that well. I suppose it could be referred to as a cheesy classic. Nevertheless, the characters and characterizations by the original voice cast always made the series entertaining if not groundbreaking.
When Warner Home Video and Turner began turning out new Scooby adventures I was dubious. I'm happy to report that all the latest cartoons benefit from better production values, witty writing and fairly well developed plots. Zombie Island and Witches Ghost both played with the conventions of the series introducing real ghosts for a change (this was prior to the feature film I might add). Additionally, many of the in jokes (such as Shaggy unpacking a suitcase full of identical clothes)made me chuckle. Alien Invaders managed to reintroduce the flower power element that made the original soooo bad it was good. The directors and writers managed to do with affection and a touch of satire.
This profitable series is on its fifth original movie for television and video. While Legend of the Vampire doesn't have the immediate wit of the previous installments, the loving satire of the cartoon and the genre as a whole is still there.
It's still fun for kids, too. I actually can sit through the latest sophisticated Scooby installments and chuckle to myself along with my kids. There's no coarse humor and no offensive language or situations. It's an example of the lost art in television animation--good clean fun that still manages to be witty and fun for adults.
The animation is clean and, although limited, an improvement over some of the previous movies. Scooby has clearly benefited from the use of computers in coloring and detailing these type of films. The fact that the original voice cast is back almost intact makes this one a trip down memory lane.
While Scooby continues to be a cottage industry for Warner, Turner and Cartoon Network, it's at least one that has improved over time. Although Scooby never reached the heights of the best Hanna-Barbera productions (and those heights never came near those of the Tom & Jerry cartoons H & B did for MGM much less the Warner shorts of Chuck Jones, Tex Avery and othrs), Scooby has managed to move into the 21st Century without losing his sense of style and fun.
It's not a classic but it's not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon.",1047772800,2,2600,4.805803571428571
1809003,4,B00007G1YN,"I was so pleased when I watched this movie.  The original Velma is back!  Nicole Jaffe hasn't been heard as Velma since 1974.  Hers is the best Velma, and it is so cool to hear her again!  Also back is the longest running Daphne voice, Heather North!  Add in Casey Kasem as Shaggy and Frank Welker as Fred, and the whole gang is back!  Plus, hearing new versions of the original background music is such a treat.  This is as close to classic Scooby Doo as you can get!",1047340800,,468,4.191011235955056
1809004,5,B00007G1YN,"I must say, my 3 1/2 year old and I have been enjoying all of the Scooby DVD's that have been released over the last couple of years.  This one is a bit different with some changes that are really good to see.  Casey Kasem is back doing Shaggy's voice, which is definitely fantastic (though it does leave me wondering where this leaves Scott Innes because, frankly, I thought he did a GREAT job in the other movies).  But, they have also brought back all of the old familiar background tunes from the 70's cartoons.  And, the opening sequence on the ship with the Scooby theme playing is perfectly retro.  The vampires are a very modern twist (not at all ""dracula"" looking- but also not bad).
The extra features on the DVD are really good (several Scooby ""music videos"" and a make-your-own monster game) - my son had a great time with them.
Even my husband sat happily through the entire movie, which is truly saying something!  5 stars!",1047168000,,937,4.514792899408284
1809005,5,B00007G1YN,"Scooby fans, you will love this brand new Scooby Doo movie!
 America's favorite cartoon character and the rest of the Mystery Inc gang, go down under, to Australia, where they encounter their scariest mystery yet.....The Legend of the Vampire!
  Scooby and pals investigate the mysterious disappearances at a Rock festival. But to do that, Scooby and the gang must first go undercover....as rock stars!
  So the Mystery Inc kids join Scooby and they don the rock star clothes and actually perform a song live on stage, with Scooby Doo on the drums!  Wait till you see Velma perform on lead vocals! You will see a side of her that you have never seen before!
  This movie is special for a few reasons.
 First, we get to see the classic Mystery Machine Van again! In the other recent Scooby movies, the gang has used an SUV, but they are back to the classic Mystery van that we all know and love.
 Secondly, this movie uses the same music that was used in the classic Scooby Doo cartoons of the 60's and 70's, thus creating the feel that you are watching the classic Scooby shows!
  Thirdly, this is pure Scooby Doo...the same Scooby that we know and love. The same fearful, hungry, and humorous canine crimefighter that we have grown so used to.
 You simply cant go wrong with Scooby Doo shows, and this is one that you and your family will cherish and enjoy for years to come.
  The DVD has some cool extra's!
 First, there is a special commentary feature, that allows you to listen to Scooby, Shaggy, and Fred, as they watch the movie with you, and talk about the movie!
 Scooby and Shaggy make fun of Fred, and how he doesnt have the ""look"" of a rock star.
 So its like getting TWO versions of the movie....the regular one, AND one with Scooby, Shaggy and Fred talking in the background as they watch the movie with you, which is very entertaining in of itself.
 There is also a blooper segment, but to see the bloopers, you first play the Monster Maker game. You can use the three different images of monsters and mix them to make a funny looking monster of your own! And after you do, you will see the bloopers!
  The DVD also features Scooby and Shaggy as DJ's, and they show a few musical Scooby videos, featuring recent and classic Scooby Doo footage!
It is very well done.
Also, you can see a sneak preview of the NEXT brand new Scooby Doo animated movie, which will come out this October (October 2003).
 If you love Scooby Doo, you will love this DVD. And if for some reason you weren't a Scooby Fan before.........one viewing of this DVD will change that.
 See what all of the Scooby Doo fans know.......... That Scooby Doo rocks!!! He is an American classic, and this DVD celebrates America's love for Scooby!",1046822400,6,2721,4.4969450101833
1809078,2,B00007G1YN,"We started with Zombie Island from 1998, and mostly they've been solid - Cyber Chase being the best story and concept but THIS ONE was terrible. Simple animation, bad story, bad new characters, bad ""monsters"", bad rock costumes, bad accents - bad everything except the main voices and it was nice to see the Hex girls back but --- how in the world is this nearly universal 5 star ratings?

1809215,2,B00007G1YN,"Loosely based on the radio series I LOVE A MYSTERY and the television series THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS, the 1969-1970 Saturday morning cartoon series wasn't much liked by critics and educators--but it was a smash with kids. (I was a fan myself.) In each episode, the five characters found themselves dropped into an unlikely mystery, and after a good deal of running around, getting separated from each other, finding a clue or two, and (perhaps) some nifty music, they unmasked the bad guy. It was all harmless fun, and it was popular enough to come back in several incarnations.

In 1998 the characters and basic premise resurfaced as a series of straight-to-video movies. The first of these was SCOOBY-DOO ON ZOMBIE ISLAND. Released in 2002, SCOOBY-DOO AND THE LEGEND OF THE VAMPIRE is the fifth in this particular series. In this episode, the gang travels by boat to Australia, where they off-load the Mystery Machine and travel to a rock festival held in the outback at ""Vampire Rock.""  They are pleased to meet old friends The Hex Girls, but they also stumble into a mystery: the rock is said to be home to a vampire, and a band that went missing last year has suddenly reappeared as the vampire's minions to kidnap bands of the present year.

The Scooby-Doo series may not be high art, but the animation is good and the stories are usually fun ... except for this episode.  The story is ragged and the plot points don't connect up in even the most casual way, and the solution requires no fewer than six masks and a ridiculously long explanation.  If you're a die-hard Scooby-Doo fan, you'll want to see it, but this probably isn't one you'll want to see more than once.

On the plus-side, all of the original cast returned, save for the late Don Messeck as our favorite canine.  For the previous movies, they'd picked Scott Innes, who did a fantastic job.  Why he didn't return for this movie is beyond me.  Frank Welker, who does most of the weird voices that you hear in animation,played Scooby in this and all movies afterward.  Since he also plays Freddy, you might expect this.  The problem is that Scooby Doo is the one voice that Welker cannot do well.",1242086400,,722,4.637795275590551

1809271,4,B00007G1YN,"If you have read my other ""Scooby Reviews"" you will know that I have had an issue with some of the newer Scooby movies that have been released which have had real monsters in them.  Because this was pretty much a sequel to ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost"" I was concerned that there would be real Vampires.  Fear not parents!  They have returned to the ""Man in a Mask"" stories which made the Scooby Doo series so lovable to begin with.

A Quick Summary: The gang (Voiced by the Original Actors) heads to the land down under to see a battle of the bands held in the Outback.  Suddenly bands begin disappearing before the show.  The mysterious Yawie Yahoo of Vampire Rock begins making appearances, so the gang decides to go undercover as a rock band to catch the mysterious monster.

My youngest (4 when we bought the movie, 6 now and still watching it) absolutely LOVES this movie.  Fortunately for parents, the artwork is fairly good, the soundtrack is excellent for a Scooby film and the acting is good.  Meaning that you can actually sit through this one several times in a row without wanting to make it ""Disappear"" like some of the other Scooby movies (sorry little buddy, I don't know WHERE that DVD could have gone too...)

The Hex Girls (from Witch's Ghost) show back up in this one, but they are much friendlier and don't mention Wicca that I can recall.  At the end of the movie you even get to watch the gang perform a rock song, which my son now knows by heart.  My final opinion, this is one of the better Scooby's that has been released in recent years, and I recommend it to parents provided you don't mind listening to a decent amount of cartoon rock music.",1211414400,,1675,4.437908496732026

Scooby and the gang have to solve the mystery of the disappearing rock performers. There has to be a logical explanation, even though everything points to minions of a real vampire doing the kidnapping. Scooby and company discover that rockers experienced with make-up, special effects and theatrics are responsible for the strange goings-on at Vampire Rock. There's even a ""cameo"" by the ""Hex Girls.""",1191283200,,657,5.19811320754717
1809273,4,B00007G1YN,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I really liked ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island"" and ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost."" I didn't much care for ""The Alien Invaders"" or ""Cyber Chase."" And the less said of the live movie, the better. This brings us to chapter 5. While ""Zombie Island"" will probably always be the best to me, this 5th chapter brings about the right compromise. It tones Scooby Doo back down to a safe level for children, but it still has mystery, suspense, and a good impact. Before our gang comes on the screen, Daniel is getting ready for a rock concert, but a 'would be' performer is seemingly kidnapped by vampires. Our favorite gang goes on a vacation to Australia to see a rock concert. And a really great treat is that while Frank Welker never abandoned his role as Fred, he is rejoined by original cast members Heather North (Daphne), Nicole Jaffee (Velmah), and Casey Kasem (Shaggy). (GREAT!) Well, when they get to the concert site, they run into the Hex Girls from ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's ghost."" (Nice continuity.) They also meet Daniel and Rus who warn them of the disappearances. Rus gives the legend behind the disappearances and we are permitted to wonder if the legend is real or if we are dealing with a bad guy in a mask. (If we watched ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost,"" we know that the supernatural is at least a possibility now.)The gang decides to disguise themselves as another rock band to see if they can find out what is going on. They later meet a rival band (Bad Omens) who are not overly nice as well as their manager Jasper who is an opportunist, but not necessarily a bad person. Soon afterwards, we meet the 'head vampire' again, and learn that he has 3 'friends.' We are lead to suspect that the not so nice Bad Omens may be them, but circumstances later remove that as a possible conclusion. So, our gang must look elsewhere or be willing to accept that the vampires are real. Unlike ""Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders"" or ""Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase"" this mystery is not so obvious. The gang's case takes on a more personal nature when their friends the Hex Girls disappear. Without ruining the ending, we are given the familiar search with some new twists. The soundtrack, though not quite on par with that of ""Zombie Island"" seems to make a comeback from ""Alien Invaders"" and ""Cyber Chase."" The gang's final confrontation is certainly toned down from ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost."" But it does rise back to acceptable levels that carefully balance tension and comedy. (Being that the original cast is back, they probably could not resist having a scene where Fred carries the whole gang! And in a sense, Frank Welker did help to carry Scooby Doo as he remained the voice of Fred through a number of different supporting actors.) The conclusion is a little more than we would have expected, and it does seem appropriate that the reunified cast gives a great performance of the Scooby Doo theme. The original cast would remain together to perform the next movie. (Chap # 6 ""Monster of Mexico"") And even though this 6th chapter is not as good, it's probably worth it just to see (or hear) the original cast together one more time. FINAL NOTE: Even if like me, you were disappointed with ""Alien Invaders,"" ""Cyber Chase,"" and the horrible live movie, DO NOT overlook this 5th chapter. It is a well done return to form, and may actually be Scooby's best movie!",1152489600,,3427,4.601307189542483

I think the idea of facing a huge vampire is... pretty decent and good, but not as good as the gang facing the Phantom Virus in Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase. Daphne's original voice actor returns, but, IMO, in some of the scenes, were a bit too off. Casey's return was done really well! The Hex Girls return in this movie, and we have new characters.

1809288,4,B00007G1YN,"I wasn't sure if taking the gang out of their usual locale of haunted mansions and creepy amusement parks and sending them to Australia was a good idea. While it is still a cool movie it would have worked just as well in Death Valley than in the Outback.
The villain this time is a Vampire called Yahoo-Yahweh, a bit of stupid name. It never sounds right when the characters say it. That minor quibble aside it's another solid entry in the recent Scooby Made For TV feature-length mysteries. Frank Welker (who's birthday it is today, coincidentally) is back as Fred and Scooby and Kasey Kasem is back as Shaggy (tho Scott Innes was perfect in the previous instalments and it puzzles why he didn't do Scooby's voice in the movie). It feels like a slickly animated version of the original show. Especially considering how Warner have decked the characters in their original clothes after fans objected to the modern clothes in the previous efforts. I have no opinion on this matter.
It was cool to see the Hex Girls return and the music this time has a slightly hipper, more techno feel and lacks the orchestral fantasy of Louis Febre's scores for Alien Invaders and Cyber Chase. It's a shame there's no soundtrack CD for this one. I'd definitely buy it.
The extras consist of a childish game and a commentary by Shaggy, Scooby and Fred. Which should be fun. The DVD is presented in bright and colorful 1.33:1 full frame (as drawn) with an above average Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.",1076889600,2,1473,4.647509578544061

The original cast seems to have all their wonderful chemistry back. Fred's calm attitude; Daphne's kind, but unaware character; Velmah's sassy charm; and Shaggy and Scooby's constant fear and appetite. We also get to see the Hex girls again.

1809291,3,B00007G1YN,"Just recently, a flood of Scooby films have been released, and the latest one was ""The Legend of the Vampire."" I didn't know how good it would be, since the last two animated scooby-films had been rather a disappointment, but when I heard the original cast was doing the voices, I couldn't stand the wait, so I saw...
Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire
Here's how it ranked...
Sound: 4/5
Well, unlike the previous films, this film used much of the same music from the original series, as well as a couple songs from previous movies. I think that wasn't what hurt the grade most, but the original songs and such were not all that great either. The ones used in the new scooby series were better, I think.
Graphics: 3/5
I was sorely disappointed with the graphics in this film. We all love the original series, but let's face facts. By today's standards, the graphics were awful, and the biggest difference between those graphics and the ones used in this movie was that the graphics in the movie may have been just a LITTLE more fluid. Overall, though, I thought the graphics in previous scooby movies were better, and the special effects, or what have you were far less dazzling than in the first four animated movies. Is it wrong to want to see something truly stunning? Overall, for a movie, the graphics were mediocre.
Story Concept: 2.5/5
EEK! Scooby and his friends tour australia, where they learn that a rock concert is being haunted by a vampire, who's kidnapping the bands. As you can tell, this is probably the worst concept they've done, if only because of it's sheer cheesyness and cynicism towards the supernatural.
Story Presentation: 3.5/5
NNNN... I was debating giving it a four, but no. Aside from a few scenes of Daphne and Velma hanging out, this was basically just an extended and more fluidly-animated episode of the series. I expected better. To be fair, it was very funny, and shaggy and scooby had some priceless lines, but the real stars of the show; Velma, Freddy and Daphne, didn't show much emotion or individuality like in previous flicks, and the fact that there was no real supernatural phenomenon (yes, I'm giving that away, because if I'd known that, I would have rented the film rather than buying it) just made things even worse. As with Alien Invaders, this film still had the classic scooby charm, but it let go of so much, becoming the second scooby film to not live up to it's name. In fact, far from not having vampires, they didn't even DESCRIBE them accurately, or even mention such words as BATS or BLOOD. I was sorely disappointed in that.
Acting: 5/5
Perfect grade here, because who plays Velma, Shaggy, Daphne and Freddy like their original voice actors? Yes, the original voices of the gang returned for this film, and that basically carries this grade.
All in All: 3.6/5
In regards to comparing it to other scooby films, I think I enjoyed it more than alien invaders, but less than the others, because frankly, this movie was funnier than alien invaders. However, Alien invaders also had some cool effects and eye candy to appease, so that's good too. Still, I was disappointed by the loss of anything remotely resembling the thrills I used to get watching Witch's Ghost and Zombie Island (the first scooby films, and still the best.) This film had the characters we love, but for me, it wasn't sufficient to really please. I'm going back and watching ""Witch's Ghost"" again tomorrow to remember what I love about scooby, but you might not be as disappointed with this film as I was. Rest assured, if you want to see a climactic thrill ride of kids fighting evil and solving mysteries, skip this film entirely, and watch Witch's Ghost again. However, if you want to see a lengthy episode of the original series, by all means, watch this film. In my opinion, good enough for the series, but not for a movie.",1049760000,8,3859,4.66813509544787
1809292,4,B00007G1YN,"My family and I enjoy classic Scooby-Doo; we like a good mystery with some antics and humor thrown in for good measure.  In subject matter, the Scooby-Doo films tend to range, it seems, from too silly (e.g. Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf) to too serious (e.g. Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island), and we prefer the classic-style, more serious of these.  Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire is happily one of these films; though it is flawed, it is worth watching.
The movie finds Scooby and the gang in Australia.  An extended rock concert is being sucked dry of performers by vampires, and Scooby and the gang attempt to find who or what is causing trouble before the concert loses its life's blood entirely.  The interesting locations and plot make for a nice change of pace.
We enjoyed the mystery and clue-gathering, but the usual chase scenes in the final third of the film were too long and confusing.  Scooby films routinely play with our notions of who the villians are, so that we will enjoy the surprise ending, but the resolution always makes some kind of sense.  Sadly, the exciting chases ran too long and muddied the waters so much that, instead of being reasonably surprised at the end, we were breathless and thinking ""Huh?"".  Some of the loose-ends were tidied up a bit forcibly, it seemed.
Although not the best of the movie series, Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire is a nice title in the same classic Scooby-Doo style as Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase, Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders, and Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (scary but good).  The first two-thirds get four stars and the last third gets three stars.  Recommended.",1048809600,3,1657,4.7859649122807015
