Drunken master was subtitled. Not that I have a problem with reading dialogue, but.... It was subtitled with chinese text on the top, and with the english cut off at the sides and on the bottom! Some words are visable, but 99% are not. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS POOR COPY",993772800,5,429,4.443037974683544
7891252,4,6305391882,"This review is towards ""Drunken Master"" and a little on ""Rumble In Hong Kong"" aka ""Police Woman"".  ""Rumble..."" really really sucks and I wouldn't recommend anyone  to watch it, even a die hard Chan fan, so just stay clear from it.  ""Drunken Master"" on the other hand is a master piece in kung fu  films.  It's very entertaining and funny so I really liked it.  The action  is good, and very entertaining.  Jackie reveals his comedic style that  would trademark his style in other movies in years after this movie.  I  would also recommend ""Drunken Master II"", which I thought was  even better than the first.",960422400,2,608,4.632075471698113
7891253,5,6305391882,"The 5 stars is actually for Drunken Master.  I have seen Rumble in Hong Kong and wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE, Chan Fan or not.  I don't even classify it as a Jackie movie.  But Drunken Master is probably one of his  best movies and was one of his first big breaks.  Comedy, action and drama  are the three main ingredients for a Jackie movie and this one has plenty  of all three.  Many people don't appreciate Jackie's older films, but there  are a lot of gems out there that people don't know about.  Just remember,  Jackie has starred in over 50 movies and has been in well over 100!  That's a lot of movies to watch! Drunken Master is definitely one to find!",947808000,8,666,4.282258064516129
7891254,5,6305391882,"This film, one of Jackie Chan's finest, apart from  Snake and Crane: Art of Shaolin (which is a must have for Chan fans), has some outstanding martial arts scenes which are almost unparalelled.  Let's face it, we don't  often watch Jackie's movies for his acting but most often his martial arts  techniques and this film definately pleases.  BUY IT!",946166400,,349,4.8474576271186445
