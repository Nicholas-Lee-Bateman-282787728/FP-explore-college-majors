8603540,5,B00EBDXSNI,"Such a cute show. This one elf has problems following directions and doing what he's supposed to do so he needs to avoid the naughty list. Great message!!! It veers a little from the traditional story in that there is no Rudolph but he is spoke of as if it were hundreds of years ago he existed, I didn't like that because my kids still think Rudolph guides the sleigh, but they didn't even notice it, I did. My 4 year old watched this over and over again throughout the season. Great soundtrack too!",1452384000,,500,4.329787234042553
8603541,1,B00EBDXSNI,The movie was just ok. Amazon video streaming is aweful. When we tried to get into the movie all it did was buffer and buffer and buffer. Avoid this movie service at all cost,1418515200,,174,4.147058823529412

8603544,5,B00EBDXSNI,"This was on TV on the Cartoon Network. It weighs in at 43 minutes. This is a cute story about two elves and a reindeer that land themselves on the dreaded ""Naughty List."" They must do penance, and through their own mishaps, must step up to the plate and save Christmas. The film also includes a robot that keeps up with both the naughty and nice lists, one that would make the NSA green with envy.

While the film is geared toward kids, there were some token statements which made this adult laugh.",1390003200,4,498,4.354838709677419
