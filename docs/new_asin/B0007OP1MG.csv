8049664,2,B0007OP1MG,"Hoot Gibson stars in a lame love story combined with a convoluted crime involving some big city (NYC or Chicago are both referred) bank robbers. One of the robbers buys a ranch in Arizona for his sister for unknown reason except perhaps so his boss can use her to carry the hot loot to Arizona. Five or six months later the gang appears in Arizona in big touring cars and wants the hot money. They kidnap the sister and shoot her brother. The ranch hands ride to the rescue and the gangsters are ambushed and killed or captured. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ho Hum. Regarding the Alpha Video DVD, the source 16mm print was in good condition and there are few lines, glitches or missing frames. Contrast is slightly light. I rate it 7.5 out of ten which for Alpha is great. The script is pedestrian at best and the action is slow even for a 52-minute film. There are many other B-westerns worth watching before wasting time on this, even if you give a hoot for Hoot.",1188864000,,971,4.430167597765363
