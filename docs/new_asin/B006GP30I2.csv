8497697,5,B006GP30I2,"Lars von Trier and Bruno Dumont are the two most interesting filmmakers working today in feature-length narrative cinema.  As in all of Dumont's films, Hors Satan immerses us in uncanny experiences and events (das Unheimliche, for followers of Freud) in order to explore his grand theme: humanity, which is the title of what is perhaps his most famous film.  But this is not a guy out there beating a drum about how glorious it is to be ""human,"" or about how we must act in more ""human"" ways to save each other, to save the planet, to find salvation, or for any other reason.  Dumont explores ""humanity"" as a concept, and asks the question where ""the human"" fits into the greater scheme of things, if there is such a scheme.  In this way he is like the Lars von Trier of Melancholia or of Antichrist, except that the term ""concept"" doesn't belong in a discussion of Dumont's films, one reason being that his characters never sit down for chats about the meaning of life -- or about anything much at all.  Most of his films -- and Hors Satan is a very striking example -- are lived experience without any flavoring (music, fancy camera work) or self-analysis on the part of the characters or the director.  This is definitely a must-see film for anyone interested in contemporary cinema.

Just as a footnote to the above, the lead actor has a quality which is absolutely unique -- tragic in a way that is beyond tragedy, but at the same time powerful in a way that is beyond any conventional notion of power.  He died of a heart attack at age 37.

Footnote to my footnote:  Bruno Dumont always (or at least almost always) takes the lead credit for Casting in all of this films.  Not since the Danish and Soviet filmmakers of the silent era have we seen such unforgettable faces or experienced such indelible screen presences as we do in his films, L'Humanit&eacute; and Flanders being two other prime examples.",1494892800,,1909,4.5852941176470585
