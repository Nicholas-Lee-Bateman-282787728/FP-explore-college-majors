8230692,3,B000Y14U60,"decent movie, sad what actress has gone thru in year following movie.. bought movie and ripped with handbrake for home theater pc",1423353600,,129,4.909090909090909
8230693,5,B000Y14U60,This is a funny love story.  The interaction between characters is very amusing.  I am a fan of Bollywood and this movie is a keeper.,1340150400,,133,4.28
8230694,1,B000Y14U60,"The premise for th plot was good. The lead characters were attractive, but the writing and direction simply stank. The sound quality was abominable.  Watching this movie I had the impression that no one really tried- it was just sort of slapped together haphazardly and with no real editing. I was disappointed.",1307664000,,311,4.980769230769231
8230695,2,B000Y14U60,"I'm not hard to please when it comes to enjoying movies, but I felt like I had wasted some time after watching this one. I gave Outsourced 4 stars.",1302134400,,147,4.103448275862069
8230696,4,B000Y14U60,"The plot was your basic ""ugly duckling"" beautiful swan scenario. However, I still came away charmed by both the male and female lead. I can definitely see the female lead making a name for herself in the U.S. if she so desires. I think the only downside was the ""hip"" black friend. Why does every movie witha socially inept white guy need the jive talking black firend to show him or her what's real? If they'd drop his character I'd give it five stars.",1206403200,,453,4.404761904761905
8230697,4,B000Y14U60,"The '07 film `Americanizing Shelley' is a low budget, good hearted comedy/romance that's sure to please if you're in the mood for a non-challenging, predictable storyline with the pre-requisite happy ending. While the credits list the names of Beau Bridges, Morgan Brittany and Will Wheaton their roles consist of little more than cameo appearances. The real stars of the film are two unknowns; Hugh Grant look-a-like Brad Raider and the stunning Indian beauty Namrata Singh Gujral who's incredible features reminds me of two of my favorite Bollywood actresses; Rani Mukerjee and Urmila Matondkar.

The cast is likeable, the Indian music festive and Namrata is enchanting. Don't expect too much and you may be pleasantly surprised. Who could ask for anything more!",1203292800,8,764,5.31404958677686
8230698,4,B000Y14U60,"If you liked ""Bend it Like Beckham"", ""The Mistress of Spices"", and ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the one with Aishwarya Rai), than this film is the next Indian styled teen flick to see which seems to have all the charm of any seventies ""ABC Afterschool Special"".  It's the typical romance story of a girl who wants to be with some other guy, and her current guy friend tries to help her, while all along he's falling in love with her himself.  I've seen this kind of story hundreds of times and I never seem to get tired of it.  It is pleasant, innocent, and charming.  In fact, this kind of story is very common in many original Bollywood films from India.

Once again, I've discovered another Indian actress who I believe is so beautiful.  Namrata Singh Gujral (Shelley) is absolutely gorgeous!  From her nerdy confused beginnings to her sexy transition throughout the film, you can't help but wonder why Hollywood doesn't use more Indian actresses.  They are all so beautiful.

Namrata Singh Gujral looks very close to my favorite Bollywood actress, Rani Mukherjee.  I'll have to see if she's done more films.  If you'd like to try a few Bollywood films that are kind of like this film, check out ""Nayee Padosan"", ""Ishq"", ""Pyaar to Hona Hi Tha"", and maybe ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.""  This is just a few.  There are hundreds of fabulous Bollywood films with good-looking guys and gorgeous girls and all that exciting Indian fashion.

I never heard of this movie before.  I just found it on a whim in the store.  And I'm glad I did.",1203206400,4,1521,4.598513011152416
8230699,5,B000Y14U60,"What a cute little film! I watched it because I liked Bend It Like Beckham a lot and this seemed similar and I am very glad I did. Its just adorable and reminds me of the older Disney films which were fun and entertaining but didn't rely on crude jokes or sexual stuff to sell a film. Goes to show that a film can be a nice family entertainment and still be a really decent, good film. Beau Bridges didn't have a big part but the leads were great and the Indian actress is gorgeaous. Also quite funny in a few parts, this is definitley worth watching in my opinion.",1202428800,2,565,4.1454545454545455
