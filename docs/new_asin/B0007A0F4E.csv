2206738,3,B0007A0F4E,"""Christmas with the Kranks"" is based on a book by John Grisham, which is odd because nothing about this movie invovled the courtroom. It is a good idea, yes, but the way the movie pulls it off is not perfect, it's not even all that good, but it certainly isn't awful. My first problem with approaching this movie was that it was written by Chris Columbus, who always ends up making his movies ""for the family."" That's why I liked the third ""Harry Potter"" movie better than the first two, because of Chris Columbus directed that one, all of the dark undertones, and creepy images would have been made ""for the family,"" and not for the viewer. I really don't like him very much, and as a writer, no. The second problem with ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is that it jumps from emotion to emotion. The entire first half was funny, the middle was physical comedy, and the finale was full of emotion, and sweet, sappy, scenes. It didn't make sense. I didn't know what kind of movie I was watching. The third problem, was that most of it wasn't funny. It was supposed to be, I'm sure, but they didn't pull it off well. It is a little overlong, but entertaining to say the least.

Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis star as Luther and Nora Krank. They have a daughter named Blair, whose going to Peru for a year and is coming back the following year. She is leaving the weekend after Thanksgiving, which means that she is going to miss Christmas. They are upset about it, Nora visablly, and Luther, not as apparent. It's raining out, and after getting drenched, Luther gets a great idea. He does some math, and realizes that they spend about $6132.00 on Christmas every year, so this year, since Blair isn't going to be there, they only spend $3000.00 and go on a cruise, bask in the Caribbean, and leave on Christmas morning. They don't do anything, no Christmas tree, no gifts, no cards, and no Christmas Eve party that they have every year. And, especially, no putting a giant seven foot snowman dubbed ""Frosty"" on the roof. This doesn't go over well with the neighbors, because on Christmas, everybody in this area is obsessed. Luther refuses to put up Frosty, having everybody chant ""Free Frosty"" outside. This really doesn't go over well with Vic Frohmeyer, who loves the neighborhood, and is pretty much the leader of it all. It's finally Christmas Eve, and they are getting ready to pack, when Blair calls and tells them that she is coming home later that night, with a surprise. Now, Luther and Nora can't tell her anything, and they rush to put together the best part ever, including getting a tree, getting a hickory honey ham, inviting all the neighbors, and finally, putting that damn snowman on the roof.

You could probably guess where the physical comedy rests. It contains, but not limited to, Nora trying to race a women to the last hickory honey ham, Luther taking the Christmas tree from the neighbor next door, and finally, Luther dangling off the roof after trying to put the Frosty up. When he falls, and there is an image of him boucning up and down, it had to be the fakest Tim Allen I have ever see. The ""heart"" of the movie comes from the neighbors Bev and Walt, who have a cat that Luther doens't like, and vice versa. Bev has cancer, and while in remission, it comes back, and it could be her lats Christmas. This felt forced in, just as a way to tie everything up together in the end. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is on the same level as the October Christmas comedy, ""Surviving Christmas,"" but none of them compare to ""The Polar Express"" which was amazing to look at. I didn't hate ""Christmas with the Kranks,"" but if you want to get into the spirt of the holiday, go check out ""The Polar Express"" instead. A fair Christmas movie that provides a few laughs. Tim Allen wasn't that bad, either.

ENJOY!

Rated PG for brief language and suggestive content.",1101427200,,3869,4.530758226037196
2206739,1,B0007A0F4E,"I wish I would have done what the title of my review says.  I figured since Tim Allen had a pretty good Christmas movie reputation, Jaime Lee Curtis is always good and the previews looked relatively funny, that I would give this movie a shot.  It was the worst hour and a half I have spent at a movie this year.

The movie is basically about The Kranks whose daughter joins the Peace Corp. and will not be home for Christmas.  For some reason that is never explained, Luther (Tim Allen) is upset at Christmas and decides to go on a cruise instead of celebrating Christmas this year.  His wife agrees and they skip Christmas.  Apparently they live in Brown-Noserville, U.S.A. because everyone in the town is obsessed with the fact that the Kranks are not celebrating Christmas.  Then their daughter decides to come home for Christmas and they need to get ready for Christmas in a hurry.  All the neighbors help them and they succeed in celebrating Christmas.  The End.

This movie was absolutely horrible.  Tim Allen's character was really pissed off the whole movie at Christmas and their was no reason for his behavior.  This is supposed to be the man who throws the best Christmas party and celebrates Christmas the most out of anyone in the town, then all-of-a-sudden he hates Christmas.  Also the way all of the neighbors were more concerned with the Kranks not celebrating then with their own Christmas was so over-exaggerated that it got annoying.  Finally, the last main stinking point of the movie was that it was NOT FUNNY at all.  I did not laugh one time this whole movie.  I have never been to a comedy movie and not laughed like I did in this movie.  What a shame.

Obviously, I cannot recommend that you see this movie.  This movie continuly dragged out and was incredibly boring.  Plus it was not funny at all.  This was one of the only movies that I have ever wanted to walk out on.  This was the worst movie that I've seen all year and if I were you, I would avoid this movie at all costs.",1101340800,14,2006,4.483425414364641

Skipping Christmas by John Grisham caught my eye because it, like A Children's Story by James Clavell, is a slim volume written by an author known for fat tomes, so I picked it up and read it last year.  The book is a fast read, funny and pointed at the same time, with a satisfying ending.  The movie is too over the top a lot of the time to elicit more than just eye rolling.",1514592000,,569,4.25

2206761,3,B0007A0F4E,"It's a little odd, and perhaps jarring, to see the actors noted for edgy work do what amounts to a family oriented christmas film.  Laurie noted for running from Jason and stripping in trading places, Cheech and his sendup and aggrandizement of drug culture, and Tim whose professional life is distinctly different from his on-screen performances.

But what do I think of the movie?  It's a bit pat and slightly over the top in a saccharine sort of way.  This is definitely ""make female audience feel good"" territory by emphasizing the relationships between the neighbors in this film, and how a community fractures and bonds with the intents, adventures and misadventures of the Kranks.

And on that note I'm tempted to give it two-stars because I just didn't find it all that entertaining.  Interesting in the sense that I didn't know they still made films like this, and even more interesting in that it utilizes actors known for some work that is far from family friendly,

The script is fairly innocent to the point of being naive in the extreme to create a kind of friendly and adversarial environment without much in the way of common sense.  And to me that separates it from christmas films of decades past in that it really placates to the target audience, and doesn't really give an inch for any kind of other humor than allegedly innocent or borderline racy without being risque gags.

In a sense corporate Hollywood has (or had) gone back to old fashioned films, but for me, it's  day late, dollar short, and really just odd beyond belief that it was cast the way it was.

That, and the story, to be honest, really isn't that good.  There's a lot of reliance on ""what will people think"" as the premise for nearly all fo the humor in this thing.  It's light entertainment, but again, unlike other seasonal films of generations past there's little satisfaction after watching this thing.",1514332800,,1897,4.746951219512195

2206774,1,B0007A0F4E,"How could a movie with such a great cast be SO BAD?  Because the script is SO BAD.  This is a lame attempt at comedy.  I cannot believe it's so bad.

SPOILER ALERT:

Here's the story:  two parents decide to go on a cruise costing $3000 instead of participating in Christmas things that cost over $6000 because they are sad that their only child will be in Peru, serving in the Peace Corps - the first Christmas without the three of them.  Then both of the parents get bullied by friends, coworkers, neighbors, and even their priest to participate in Xmas.  What kind of person finds bullying funny?  Social conformity is a form of bullying, and it's not funny - even back in 2004 when this movie was made.  Then, their daughter calls to say she's coming home with her fiancee, so they decide to skip the cruise and go all in for Christmas with its ensuing ""comedy.""  It's interesting that the Chicago suburbs have green, green grass in December - with snow on the ground, too.  When the daughter's police escort is told to stall, it is a bit funny as the police car goes super slow and is passed by vehicle after vehicle. Then there's the party at the house with ""hijinks"" and a mystical Santa.

Don't waste your time on this. There are far better classic holiday movies and even some modern day ones that are so much better.

I don't think I'd want to hang out with people who find this movie entertaining. We obviously have a different definition of entertainment.

2206811,3,B0007A0F4E,"Just a silly movie I enjoy but does not have anything to do with a religious Christmas (in case you were looking; I wasn't); typical Hollywood fun with the ""modern"" Nothingness of the American holiday (i.e., no ""Holy,"" just gluttony).

Great fun but trivial, really poor production for any sort of reality like plane-hair from a supposed Peace Core placement; I was looking for light fun w/ my family's heavy medical problems, so this fit the bill. Still, how does one compare to great movies?: ""Pllllllll...""

Sure it's a bit cheesy, but the acting is solid, the characters are great and the movie is funny without being vulgar.  You may even shed a tear.

Many ""Christmas Crisis"" movies seem to focus on the slapstick, and gags for far too long. I enjoy that this movie dials down the slapstick and has a great message about friends, family and community coming together.",1512518400,,505,4.538461538461538

2206904,1,B0007A0F4E,"As a fan of Christmas movies in general, no matter how poorly performed or written, I really tried to like this movie. Luther's plan to ""skip"" Christmas wasn't born out of any ""Grinchy-ness"" but rather a desire to forego the $6,000+ his family spent on Christmas last year. He and his wife agree to still make their charitable donations. Although they are skipping Christmas, his wife still volunteers at the local soup kitchen. There is some inconsistency in what they consider needs to be ""skipped"" and what is still worth doing (Luther skips his donation to the police force and refuses a tree sold by the Boy Scouts). But overall they seem to still participate in the pieces of the season that really are the ""true meaning"" of Christmas, simply foregoing hosting giant parties, decorating, or gift buying. From the first moment they decide to forego their traditional celebration, their neighbors, co-workers, etc. become controlling and ridiculous. Using what amounts to bullying tactics to force them to behave the way they want. The main characters are inconsistent from one scene to the next. The ancillary characters are obnoxious. The humor varies from a few well delivered lines (best parts) to really poorly done special effects such as a frozen cat (worst part). It's hard to care about much in this movie as I found myself actually hating every character at one point in the movie. The only exception was a small neighbor boy who I wish had a bigger role. He's played by the young kid from Malcom in the Middle and his character is great. Sadly you don't see much of him. Speaking as someone who can find something I like about almost any Christmas movie and DVRs every made for TV movie of the season, don't waste your time.",1482451200,6,1739,4.780730897009967

Quick Synopsis
For the first time, Luther (Tim Allen) and Noras (Jamie Lee Curtis) daughter, Blair (Julie Gonzalo) was not going to be spending Christmas with the family. Luther decides to book an expensive cruise for Christmas; the only catch was he and his wife had to commit to a total boycott of the holiday season. This really disturbed the seemingly Christmas obsessed community and some neighbors took it a lot harder than others. After nearly making through the holiday, of course Blair calls on Christmas eve and decides to surprise her parents by flying in. Will the Kranks be able to pull off a miracle Christmas for Blair? Will the neighbors forgive the Kranks for their lack of holiday enthusiasm? I guess youll have to watch and see = )

Opinion
I think this is one of those movies where a lot of people don't appreciate it the first time they watch it.  I know I didn't love this movie when I first seen it. I happened to catch it on TV the following year and I couldn't change the channel. I have watched this movie several times now and I grow fonder of it every time.

Yes, its a goofy / silly / and over-the-top Christmas movie but its also cleaver and meaningful at its core. Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen are the perfect duo and they really make this movie shine. Also, I am not a big Dan Aykroyd fan but I loved him in this movie.

2206985,5,B0007A0F4E,"This film adaptation of the book ""Skipping Christmas"" by John Grisham is a gem.  Allen and Curtis are excellent as Luther and Nora Krank, a couple who find the idea of Christmas depressing without their only daughter who has left to serve in the Peace Corps.  They therefore decide to skip Christmas.

Jamie Lee Curtis is every bit as funny as Tim Allen in this film, maybe even better.

This film is so good that we make it part of our annual family countdown to Christmas.

The acting, including all of the supporting actors do a fantastic job.  You'll live Luther's interactions with his neighbors, co-workers, and especially with his wife, Nora.  The scene at the tanning salon is classic, as is Luther's botox treatment.

It's good family fun from start to finish.

Because it was an international shipment (not my choice) it cost me more for the return postage ($13.70) than was the cost of the product to begin with.  I had to return it in order to receive the refund.  I don't feel it was fair to me, the consumer.  The Brits should have known that their DVDs won't work in the U.S.A.  Apparently there is a difference in the electric power in some way.  I have no knowledge of these things, but I don't feel that this should have happened.  I will appreciate a reply concerning this.

Good acting, and a little bit of a different plot than most Christmas movies, so it is a nice change of pace.  The ending though is somewhat strange and awkward, but I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie.  Basically when the Krank's daughter says she isn't going to be there for Christmas, they decide to go on a cruise and essentially boycott Christmas.  This causes problems within their neighborhood which is full of Christmas tradition and Cheer.  But once their daughter surprises them with a phone call that she and her fiance will actually make it for Christmas, they need to abort their plans and try to throw together a Christmas atmosphere.

2207138,3,B0007A0F4E,"With their daughter away in the peace core, Nora and Luther Krank have decided to skip Christmas this year, and take a cruise to the Caribbean. There is only one problem, their Christmas Eve party and elaborate decorations are a staple of their neighborhood, and when the neighbors find out that the family is skipping Christmas this year, they go out of their way to change their minds. This film is your typical goof ball, family, holiday film, except with a much better cast then these things typically have. The chemistry between Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis was terrific, and in my opinion make the whole thing work. Besides the big named cast, producers also included a ton of cameos from the likes of Cheech Marin, Dan Akyrod, and Felicity Huffman, just to name a few. Seeing a big name you really like, who is not listed in the credits, show up even for a small role, it always adds to the enjoyment of the film. This is not the kind of movie that is going to win any awards. It might not even be the kind of holiday film that is remembered ten years from now, but it's certainly entertaining, with some heartfelt moments, and it's good for a few cheap laughs. Christmas With The Kranks delivers everything you expect from a holiday movie, as it is something you can watch with the whole family and it will put you in the holiday spirit.",1419379200,,1347,4.479674796747967
2207139,1,B0007A0F4E,"The book WAS better, folks! Yep. First off, I have to say that if this is someone's idea of a happy holiday, then I'd rather be stuck with lumps of coal in my stocking. Poor Luther Krank (Tim Allen) talllies up how much he spent the previous Christmas and decides that with their daughter off in Peru, he and the wife should take a Christmas cruise instead. Nora Krank (Jaime Lee Curtis) reluctantly goes along with her miserly husband's scheme, much to the consternation of the nosy neighbors. For one thing, this movie is annoying in that the hapless Kranks are bullied left and right by their so-called neighbors. The Kranks' blonde Barbie doll of a daughter, Blair, is off on a Peace Corps mission in Peru and Luther doesn't see the value in spending money on local charities, expensive Christmas parties, and lugging a giant snowman to pin to his roof just so the whiny neighbors can win some award for best decorations. Luther is a very smart man.

Unlike his neighbors who proceed to harass him and Nora, thinking he's Scrooge for not giving in to the annual holiday celebration of greed and materialism. When not being threatened with bodily violence for not nailing Frosty to his roof, Luther and Nora are busy tanning themselves at the local mall, losing weight, and trying the latest in Botox. The humor in this movie is forced and comes at a high price. Poor Nora takes the brunt of victimization when she's trying to tan at the mall and ends up banging her head. When she clomps off to find a band-aid, the local priest sees poor Nora cowering in her teeny bikini and deduces that she is bound for hell. She stumbles through an explanation, but I didn't think she had to explain anything. I also found the local neighborhood busybodies' intimidation of Luther and Nora to be profoundly disturbing. They have to hide in their basement and Nora has to sneak out of her own house. Ridiculous and all for some stupid Christmas decorations!

Seems the Kranks' neighbors are indeed one with the Christmas spirit. More along the lines of the 7 Deadly Sins. They are a covetous, sniveling greedy bunch who would rather condemn Luther for deciding to skip Christmas, rather than ask him why. If I had neighbors like these, I'd sell and get the heck out, leaving Frosty's shattered remains trailing behind my car. But I digress. The vapid and spoiled Blair suddenly calls and informs her parents that she's coming home!

Ugh, what is with this kid? Instead of telling the brat they're taking a cruise and good luck in finding the key under the mat, Luther and Nora spend the last half of the movie racing to find what's left of the Christmas trappings they so wanted to leave behind. Luther buys a dead tree and then pleads with a neighbor to let him borrow his. Nora must find a particular honey ham that Blair just has to have. And of course, the nosy neighbors start sniffing and giggling when poor Luther nearly kills himself trying to put that stupid snowman on his roof.

When told about daughter dearest returning home for the Kranks' annual holiday party and all that, the neighbors decide Blair shouldn't be punished for her father's miserly ways. I found the whole neighbors banding together at the last minute a little farfetched. One minute they're salivating over Luther's desperate search for trees and near death, the next they are ready to help out with turkeys and decorations galore. All for the purpose of pleasing a spoiled little princess who can only think of her ham and caramel pie. She doesn't ask once what her parents wanted to do. She assumes Christmas is on and even lugs along her new boyfriend to show off at the party.

This movie is distasteful on so many levels, I can't even list them all. But aside from the general all-around nastiness, you have Dan Aykroyd wasted as the neighborhood Stalin, Cheech Marin and Jake Busey as the Keystone Cops, and Austin Pendleton as Santa Claus. Watching this mess of a movie, I wished that Luther and Nora had taken that trip and told their selfish daughter and the nasty neighbors to stick a candy cane where the sun doesn't shine.

But they don't. The ending is supposed to redeem Luther in some way, but I thought it was a little contrived. The whole thing is a mess from start to finish with the only funny thing when Luther is so Botoxed, he can't eat his peaches and they keep slipping out of his mouth. Other than that, do yourself a favor and watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation instead.

One star. Jamie Lee and Timmie were utterly wasted in this. I kept hoping Michael Meyers would show up and show someone how to a stuff a turkey.",1419379200,10,4624,4.618004866180049
2207140,4,B0007A0F4E,"This is a warm hearted Christmas film. It's silly and yes there are some parts that are unbelievable such as the Botox scene, mostly because we all know them to be untrue.

The premise was fine but the way the neighbors turned on them like a pack of hyenas was very dissettling.  I understand that it was needed for the storyline, but I felt it was a bit overboard to the point of being mean and nasty.  The turn around to being helpful at the end was not believable to me.  Good cast with decent acting.  The storyline is about a couple, whose daughter has went off to the peace corps for a year, decide to forgo Christmas and instead go on a Caribbean cruise.  Their friends, co-workers and neighbors turn on them because the cold way he announces it to everybody in a memo.  The emotions are there, but extremely pushed beyond the limits.

2207191,2,B0007A0F4E,"This is one of those times where I messed up and read the book before seeing the movie. I thought the book was funny and charming - a cute idea taken to extremes with a sweet ending. As soon as I finished the book I saw the movie - and was really disappointed at the subtle changes to the main characters. I know book-to-movie conversions are never 100%. Usually that doesn't bother me, but this time the characters went from being merely determined to downright ruthless.

The idea is simple - this year they try opting out of all the holiday hoopla. In the book they stick to their guns, but do it in a way that isn't obnoxious. When Luther doesn't buy holiday calendars for a fundraiser, he offers to donate money in the summer instead. Throughout the book I could sympathize with the main characters and even appreciate what they were trying to do. When the newspaper calls them ""selfish"" I was outraged on their behalf.

**SPOILERS**

But when in the movie Luther hoses down the sidewalk to punish the Christmas carolers, I frowned and was uncomfortable. Rather than finding it funny, I found it mean. Over and over, I found Tim Allen's character to be antagonistic towards Christmas, rather than Grisham's character simply wanting to be left alone. Those charities and fundraisers? Just a ""NO"" and door slam. Rather than no decorations at all, Allen angrily rips a wreath off the door. And how many times does he need to step on (or hurt) that cat? By the time the newspaper calls the Kranks ""selfish"" I was cheering for the neighbors!

I also found most of the movie's attempt to 'kick it up a notch' really annoying. The Botox and bathing suit scenes were ridiculous. In the book Mrs. Krank spends a lot of time crying or yelling, but I could still sympathize with her. Rather than being stressed out by Christmas, she's stressed out by non-Christmas fallout. In the movie, though, Jamie Lee Curtis spends most of her time either shrieking or acting like she is being stalked by the uni-bomber. WAY too over the top. In the book the neighbors are nosy and annoying. In the movie they are an angry hostile mob. Again - WAY too over the top and too much anger to be funny.

IMO, this is one of those times where Hollywood ruined a good book. The movie just had too much of an undercurrent of anger and hostility to be funny. Glad I caught it on Netflix before I wasted money buying it.",1417564800,,2391,4.51270207852194

2207197,3,B0007A0F4E,"Christmas with the Kranks is a Christmas comedy that was based on the novel by John Grisham known as Skipping Christmas. The plot is about a couple who decided to skip the  Christmas celebrations for the year as their daughter isn't with them to celebrate it. However,things begin to change when they received a phone call from her and providing him the big news. Well,everyone probably already knows what's going to happen next.

This was unfunny and unoriginal. No wonder it was bashed by the critics and moviegoers alike. There is nothing added to the celebration of the holidays upon watching this film. The jokes are corny and the emotions does not even generate anything positive and special at all. Despite of having a great and talented cast,they basically could not even lift its screenplay to becoming at least an average film and it did not do any justice at all to Grisham's readable non-legal thriller novel. What's worse,one might be even tempted to skip Christmas after seeing it.",1416268800,,995,4.881656804733728

2207422,4,B0007A0F4E,"OK, this isn't the most profound Christmas movie ever made--we all know what that is already. Nothing will ever touch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as far as great Christmas movies go--very few movies on any subject are that great. But nonetheless, ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a fun movie that demands little in the way of emotional or intellectual devotion--it's just a sweet innocent family movie that was designed to make you feel good and hopefully make you laugh a few times and this movie does its job extremely well.

I first saw this film on TV and, because I didn't see it from the start, I ordered it online and, by sheer coincidence, it was the first movie I watched on my new TV. I think that both Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are underrated comedic actors and they both play very likable characters in this film. Yes, of course, the story is contrived and silly and the screenplay has logic gaps that you could drive a Christmas-tree truck through, but it's still a fun film that everyone in the family can watch. And there are a few tender moments that are pretty well done.

One of the things that I love is the aerial footage of the neighborhood (probably just a model or done with CGI) with all the Christmas lights lit--some extremely pretty photography. The neighborhood in the film is a very idealized vision of suburbia, but that's OK--nothing wrong with playing to people's fantasies of what life should be.

Anyway, not a ground-breaking film by any means, but an extremely pleasant way to sip a cup of tea, eat a few Christmas cookies and enjoy some stress-free Christmas moments. I watched the movie after Christmas because, as much as I love Christmas movies, I've pretty much grown to loathe what has become of the holiday itself.

The frustrating thing for me in watching films like this is wondering: How close was this to being a great film if they had only hired better writers to punch up the script--or perhaps if they had left the original script alone? I'm going to read Grisham's book and see.",1389225600,,2028,4.609418282548477

Why couldn't this dumb couple (Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) just tell their daughter they were going on a cruise for Christmas, instead of all the elaborate junk they had to do just so she could have this perfect Christmas to come home to?  I get upset just thinking about it.  The neighbors were all annoying, the comedy was unfunny to me.  Why anyone thinks this was a funny movie is beyond me.  We should have watched the first ""Santa Claus"" movie--Tim Allen was better in that one anyway.

The cast of character actors is like comfort food, from M. Emmet Walsh as the crusty neighbor, to Tom Poston as the Priest, Cheech Marin as the local cop and Austin Pendleton in a surprise role.'
Dan Aykroyd hams it up but his over-the-top performance reminds me of neighbors I've had.
It's not for everybody.  I figure you'll either love it or you'll say ""meh"".  But give it a try.  It might become a standard entry in your family holiday viewing as it has in mine.",1386979200,,744,4.571428571428571

Lots of great stuff that you expect from Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis , and Dan Ackroyd.  Along with that is the slightly risqu stuff *(a Spoiler Alert - scene at the local mall tanning salon where they bump into their local clergyman passing by ! )  Really the focus of the movie is how easy it is to forget what the meaning of the holiday season is and just how far Good Will towards men really extends when you get past the crazy temporary expectations of those around you.

And it is, when Tim Allen wants to skip Christmas for a 10 day cruise. But his wife isn't the only one who hates the idea. The humor starts with the neighbors, led by the Great Outdoors guy, demanding Tim Allen puts ""Frosty"" up. A large seven foot Snowman decoration. When they are finally convinced to do Christmas it is chaotic last minute Holiday shopping. It's alot funnier than it looks and has a cute plot.

It is completely true to the book and completely enjoyable.  I have kicked off each Christmas season with it since then.  (And, I must admit, the Charlie Brown movie.)

Although I haven't felt that extreme about Christmas yet, I do feel that about some holidays and can relate to many of the humorous aspects of their need to avoid it altogether (if only for one year).  Of course, everyone comes together at the end to celebrate Christmas as a family and to extend a generous gift to a needy neighbor to give you that warm and fuzzy feeling.

It was a nice suprise to see the some chemistry between Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis that reminded me of my own parents and how they handle situations.  Looking forward to watching it again this year.  Recommend!",1355097600,,758,4.378571428571429

I looked around the theater, and found most of those laughing - were women. Their dates were looking as bewildered as us. It was as if the movie was intended as an in-joke for women.

A year later, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" came out on DVD. I picked up a copy for my wife, and as you'd expect, she talked me into watching it with her. I found myself almost liking it. The next evening, with the house to myself - I decided to play it again. I don't even know why.

But, it all began to make sense. I could see what my wife, her sister, and all the women in the theater found so funny. It isn't the over-the-top, slapstick of Tim Allen (who I am a fan of). It's the subtle humor of the more true-to-life Jamie Lee Curtis. She's the perfect foil for Tim Allen. But more than that - she's the unsung STAR of this Christmas comedy. Once I understood that - the movie became very funny for me. Now, it's a staple of our Christmas classics viewing.",1352764800,20,1215,4.278260869565218

What was tender humor in the book became a bit slapstick in the movie, even though the plot is very close to the original book.

The basic idea is that once their daughter leaves home, Luther Krank decides to get away from the ice and snow. His solution? By not spending money on Christmas, he can save enough to go to the Caribbean. Unfortunately, his neighbors don't like this departure from the norm.

2207742,3,B0007A0F4E,"This is not a perfect Christmas movie by any means PERIOD.

The pros: The snow and all the christmas stuff and atmosphere is cute charming and puts you in the holiday spirit.

The main characters sudden change at the end was too convenient and the sad story at the end thats meant to touch us seems forced and just thrown up there to tie all the loose ends of the film.

Granted yes when I originally watched it it made me tear up because I thought it was sweet. My father died in July and this was one of his favorite Christmas movies so I will probably tear up again at that part just because... I miss him and know he enjoyed this movie.

The humor and slapstick in the movie was so so it was extremely forced and strained and unfortunately this was easy to spot which ruined the so called comedy of the movie immediately.

I felt like I was forcing myself to even chuckle during this movie when I first saw it on Dvd back in 2005 .

The acting from almost everyone involved is horrible Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were not that bad but they seemed to be zombies just reading their lines through half the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis characters screaming also got extremely annoying irritating and aggravating after a while talk about OVERACTING to the point of no return.

Tim Allens character as usual like in most of his movies tries way too hard to be funny and its not convincing or interesting for the most part unfortunately.

The supporting characters an annoying whiny kid 2 idiotic cops who add nothing to the movie whatsoever a daughter who changes her mind at the last minute and decides to come home for Christmas with her good looking boyfriend. 2 friends of Jamie Lee Curtises you only see 2 freaking times throughout the movie neighbors that are so grating you'd want to punch them all out and a MAYOR with the most annoying monotone voice ever heard and as intimidating as a pussy cat would be.

The only neighbors that are nowhere near as annoying are the kindly elderly woman and her husband dealing with health issues .They were pretty much the only REAL characters worth sympathizing or caring about period.

Oh I forgot a ridiculous part of the movie revolves around a petty robber that adds nothing to the movie whatsoever AGAIN and a MYSTERIOUS stranger who offers the main character an umbrella at the beginning of the movie. With this being a Christmas movie and all I am sure people can guess who he turns out to be in the end. I loved the snow the christmas decorations but the story itself was ridiculous and the lengths these insane neighbors go to is extremely stupid and not even the least bit believeable either.",1323820800,,2646,4.482328482328482

Wow was I disappointed!  This has go to be the worst film either one of them have done!  Talk about slow,boring and dull!

Apparently the makers of this film were not aware that bullying people into conforming to neighborhood standards of Christmas celebration does not represent goodwill to all. A few of the situations might have presented good comic opportunities in more careful hands, but this film ends up feeling superficial and forced throughout, with a completely patronizing ""moral"" at the end.",1321228800,3,607,5.204081632653061

It is funny and heartwarming and actually has a point that Christmas is more than just about the decorations (even though I love decorations!). It is about family and having the chance to be together.  I do wish they had wanted to donate the money they were saving to a homeless shelter or food bank and then do something that made a difference during the Christmas season other than plan a cruise, but I guess that is too much to ask.

The movie is so stupid...the botox injections...seriously?  The part where Luther has something special and Nora is practically tearing her clothes off...give me a break!

2207753,1,B0007A0F4E,"A couple of weeks ago I watched a dvd I had and as an extra there was a trailer for this movie, which I had taped from tv but never watched.
The trailer was superb, it made this movie seem like a hilarious non-stop fun fun fun movie.
Well...congratulations to the people who edited the trailer cause they made a stinker seem like a great movie.
I don't know, where should I start?
How is it possible that Jamie Lee Curtis always finds herself in crap movies? The lady has a great comic talent and squanders is every time in abysmal comedies. Tim Allen...does he only do Christmas movies?
Whatever, the movie drags on, is really uncomfortable to see how this neighborhood gangs up on a couple just because they want to avoid/skip Christmas, especially given the reason they had for doing so, or at least what was initially the reason.
Then those really umcomfortable situations like having to watch poor JLC in that skimpy swimsuit in the mall with everyone looking, and she just stays there, and lets herself be treated like a stupid cow.
That's just ONE example where these poor foolish people find themselves in bad or weird situations, have perfectly good exmplanations but they don't say anything! Couldn't Tim Allen said to the cops he had the guy's keys and asked to borrow his tree? No, it's better to let yourself be handcuffed by the mafia police and go to jail! It's more fun!...
Another annoying trait of this movie is what was done with the filming: I don't know what or why, but there are a lot of scenes where the focus shifts from one person to another and with the wide-angle or whatever lense they used, these changes are very obvious and just look wrong. Because they are obvious, but also because suddendly the image on the left and right edges changes, you either lose details or gain them. The result looks like really sloppy work, but seeing the focus shift from one point to the other so often in the same movie is weirdl

2207764,5,B0007A0F4E,"Luther Krank is fed up with all the hoopla of Christmas. He's tired of the corny office parties, the cold weather, the decorations that would only stay up for a few weeks, and most of all the money they spend on frivolous things. With his only daughter away for Christmas, all he wants to do is get away from it all. A nice relaxing week on a Caribbean cruise will be just the thing to take his mind off of the holidays. He thought the hardest part was going to be convincing his wife this was a good idea. Little did he know that Skipping Christmas was not going to be an easy task, especially if their neighbors have anything to say about it.

Their neighbors have decided the Kranks lack of interest in the holiday is just plain selfish. They begin a campaign to get the couple back into the Christmas spirit. Whether they like it or not.

When Luther is just hours away from winning, he's thrown for a loop when his daughter decides she's returning for a visit with her new fianc. Now the Kranks must rely on the very people they have alienated the last month to help them bring the holiday spirit home. Not only do they learn the true meaning of Christmas, but they also learn the true meaning of friendship.

Skipping Christmas is my all time favorite holiday book and one I read every year.

John Grisham allows the reader to feel the haunting loss of a family member during one of the most important holidays of the year, while tickling the reader's funny bone with slapstick pranks pulled by both Luther and his neighbors. The battle over raising Frosty took on a life of its own. Since the release of the movie, Christmas with the Kranks, I've added watching it with my family as a new tradition. With Tim Allen playing Luther Krank, it has quickly become a favorite for the rest of my family, too. Allen's quirky humor definitely makes this movie one you don't want to miss.

The book and the movie bring different experiences to the story, so definitely check them both out. I think you will find them BOTH irresistible.

Almost everyone has wanted to skip Christmas, has hidden in the house from Christmas Carolers and felt the pressure of neighbors to ""keep up with the Jones"" with Christmas decorations.  All I had to do was LOOK at Jamie Lee Curtis and the frumpy hair and Christmas Vest and I had to laugh.  While Tim Allen was hysterical as the husband preparing for Carribbean Cruise by getting botox injections.  I watched the movie 3 times and everytime I belly laughed at Tim Allen trying to eat in a restuarant with his face frozen by the botox.  Jamie Lee was perfect as the suburban housewife, hiding in her home one day from the neighbors demanding that Jamie give them the huge 15 foot snowman in their basement, so that they may decorate the Kranks roof with it - like every year.
Anyone who appreciates Jamie Lee, frumping down into a great performance, espeically as she fights a shopper for the last Honey Ham in the grocery store, will chuckle at this movie, and laugh out loud in some places.

2207773,4,B0007A0F4E,"My biggest complaint about the movie is the title.  ""Skipping Christmas"" is a much better one and I don't understand why the change to ""Christmas With the Kranks"".  However, having said that, I still thought this film version of Grisham's book was pretty well done.  There are always changes from the book in the film versions, but I thought this one stayed true to the spirit of the original story.

There are some great comic bits when Tim Allen and Jamie Leigh are getting ready for their cruise (i.e. the tanning booth, Allen's botox injections).  But the comedy is not the point of the story.  The overall message of the book and this film comes through very nicely and sweetly - faith, family, friends, community, and giving of ourselves is what the true spirit of Christmas is about.  Tim Allen's character transforms from practical, to stubborn, to selfish, to redemptive (by the end of the film).  If you put yourself in his shoes, you can definitely relate to his sense of dismay when you take into account all he endured to overcome his misunderstanding neighbors, when his well-laid and practical (even ingenious) plans came unraveled at his daughter's unexpected call on Christmas Eve that she would be home for Christmas.

Yes, the neighbors are annoying, but even they become endearing when, for Allen's daughter's sake, they come together to help them prepare for her homecoming.  For me, though, the whole film comes together in that final scene when Allen's character, in spite of his disappointment and resentment, allows his heart (and I believe - his God) to move him to do something unselfish, sacrifical and loving for someone else.  This act redeems his character and the story.

I think if you just watch the film and let it carry you through the story through Allen's character's eyes - you will enjoy the film and especially the ending.  Definitely worth watching.",1260144000,,1891,4.871875

The negativity of the neighbors when the Kranks decide not to decorate is definitely not in keeping with the Christmas spirit, but OK, maybe that's how life is. But I found it to be somewhat of a turn-off. Why my four stars? Well, there were plenty of heartwarming moments...especially those involving the neighbor with cancer. AND there were plenty of hilarious moments too...such as the canned ham sequence. The neighbors redeem themselves when they all pull together when the Kranks need them.

All actors do a fine job with the material given, but aside from the scene where the cruise tickets are given to the elderly couple across the street, the film lacks the genuine sentiments of other holiday films (such as ""The Holday"" and others).

Go figure.

So we sit down to watch this fiasco and guess what...she converts.

There's really only so much that can be said about the mess that is `Christmas with the Kranks.'  Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are the worst they've ever been, which is still leagues ahead of Dan Aykroyd and the plot is just one of the worst I've had to endure.  The gags are redundant and barely giggle worthy (except maybe the tanning scene, but that alone does not make this movie remotely watchable) and the whole `sentimental-heartwarming' scene at the end seems out of place even if it is (cough) sweet.

First let's review the plot.  Luther and Nora Krank love Christmas.  In fact they are the center of Christmas in their town.  Then their daughter Blair joins the Peace Corp and informs mom and dad that she will not be home for Christmas.  Luther then decides that this would be a good time for him to take Nora on a cruise, skipping Christmas altogether and enjoying some alone time.  Little did he realize that skipping Christmas was `against the law' in his town.  Yes, the villagers revolt and protest the Krank's personal decision which is not funny, it's stupid, because if anyone reacted to any of my decisions with such ridiculous animosity I would have them beaten.

Oh yeah, then Blair calls.  She's coming home for Christmas after all (didn't she JUST leave) and she's getting married (she known him, what, three days) and wants her new fianc&eacute; to experience a Krank Christmas.  So now, after burning every bridge in the neighborhood, Luther and Nora now have to gather all their `ex-friends' together for help in throwing the best Christmas party they've ever thrown.

The acting is just as atrocious as the plot.  Allen and Curtis are obviously hamming it up because they have to.  They realized shortly after filming that this film was a drag and so they decided to have fun with their mistake.  I can respect that, but they are still very unfunny.  Aykroyd is a mess.  Walsh is the only `decent' actor here, playing his Scrooge type character well, and the last scene with him and Luther is touching even if it is misplaced.

It's safe to say that I loathed this film.  In fact I'm thinking of skipping Christmas every year...oh wait...I already do...now what do you have to say about that (as I hide from angry mod with pitchforks).",1197849600,7,2532,4.650900900900901

Finally once the Kranks decide to conform and hold Christmas after all, the neighbors are helpful and sweet! I'm amazed at how many people are calling this movie sweet and wholesome.  I found it unfunny and actually rather unsettling.  Heaven forbid a non-Christian ever move onto THAT block!

I understand the concept of loving our children, but when they show up out of the blue, and we must decide whether to honour the needs/wants of our spouse or those of our children, all too often we allow our children to replace our spouses as our best friends. We did not marry our children; they were thrust upon us by genetics. We take care of them until they are able to fly by themselves, but once they are older--like Blair, who now is old enough to have a fiance (read ""adult"")--we must address the task of restoring our spousal relationships to their proper position of paramount importance. This movie fails miserably at this task, and so I find it to be depressing. Yes, the movie is a comedy, but this aspect of the comedy hits too close to home within a society where marital relationships have become grossly devalued. I believe a sillier impetus for the Kranks missing their vacation would have gone a long way in making this movie funnier.  Ziggel & Egbert",1197331200,,1265,4.647321428571429
2207799,3,B0007A0F4E,"Based on John Grisham's novel, ""Skipping Christmas"", (which I thoroughly enjoyed) ""Christmas with Kranks"" is about a couple played by Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis that decide not to get bogged down with all the financial traps and traditions of the season and take one year off from the Christmas festivities and go on a cruise. Main reason-their daughter has gone into the Peace Corps and won't be home for Christmas.

However, busy-body neighbours like Dan Ackroyd and M.Emmet Walsh make Skipping Christmas impossible!! If I had neighbours like this I'd sell my house very quickly!!! A bit over the top with how offended they are that the Kranks aren't celebrating Christmas, or putting their Frosty on the roof like the rest of the block. These people need a life!! But I think the ridiculousness of the plot was what John Grisham was going for in the first place. He shows us how we are sometimes so over-committed and overwhelmed at Christmas with the wrong things-material things.

By the end of this movie, things turn from slap-stick to more serious. The Kranks daughter DOES end up home for Christmas and the Kranks end up scrambling to decorate and put their annual Christmas party together in a matter of hours. But perhaps the most touching part is when Luther Krank (Tim Allen) gives his tickets for the cruise to his neighbour across the street who constantly bugged and made fun of him. His wife is dying of cancer and he gives Walt (M.Emmet Walsh) the tickets so that they can spend one last wonderful Christmas together on a cruise.

Clearly the filmmakers realized that most people, like me, didn't actually read ""Skipping Christmas"", but glanced at the last line in a bookstore at some point...

Yes, this is a mediocre movie.  However, I think the level of vitriol in some of the reviews it has received, both on Amazon and elsewhere, is absurd.  I love Roger Ebert and his books collecting negative reviews, but he reviewed ""Christmas with the Kranks"" as though it were a cultural document of the utmost significance.  It's just a silly holiday movie!

One thing I certainly did not like about ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was the sequence of Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis visiting a tanning salon.  People who use tanning salons greatly increase their risk of skin cancer, and I did not appreciate the depiction of this risky behavior on the part of responsible adult characters in a family comedy.

The neighbors rebel because the Kranks always have the best Christmas party and they are the only ones on the street who have not properly decorated their home in line with the way the others have.

It tried for slapstick, farce, sentiment, message, etc., and never landed squarely on any one of them. Tim Allen is average and mostly believable, and Jamie Lee Curtis has been better in other things (like A FISH CALLED WANDA). But there was a nice supporting cast, including old timers like Austin Pendleton and Tom Poston. Nice to see them.

Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin hated it. Roger gave it one star and said it wasn't funny, anywhere, ever. Leonard rated it BOMB. Ebert did point out one thing I thought was rather odd, that the couple's daughter has been gone in the Peace Corps for only a few weeks when she flies home for Christmas with her boyfriend. I mean, the movie opens at an airport the Sunday after Thanksgiving. A point is made of that date. Then when she phones from the Miami airport saying she's flying home on Christmas Eve, no one thinks anything of it. I didn't realize the Peace Corps was such an open thing that you could pick up and fly home scant weeks after you got there.

If you want slapstick humor in a Christmas movie, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION is better. If you want schmaltz, neither one is satisfying.

My family and I, however, pretty much enjoy this movie and would actually watch it again sometimes in the future. The cast interconnected with each other and the plots were simple and comical.

Luther Krank (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) took a large bold step of the year to not celebrate X-mas for that year, since their only daughter went off to join the peace corps and after finding out their X-mas yearly are pretty much costly. Luther decided to bring his wife to go relaxing with him by taking a cruise. Neighbors and friends were pretty much appauled by this decision and Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd) actually try to conviced them to celebrate X-Mas once more.

Everything goes well for the Kranks, except that Nora was about to gave into peer pressure, when their daughter, Blair (Julie Gonzalo), called in to dropped the news on them that she's coming home for X-Mas with the guy she loves.

Plenty of reviews to see what the story is all about so I'll just jump into my take on it. If I had neighbors that stuck their noses into my life to that extent I would think I was in hell. My wife, on the other hand, thought it was funny. So it's one for ""funny"", one for ""extremely irritating"". The whole idea that taking a cruise at Christmas time is some sort of rejection of Christmas was another point of irritaion. Christmas is wherever you are, isn't it? I lightened up after it was half over and accepted the movie for whatever it was. Seemed to get better near the end of the movie but it was probably due to them caving in to their neighbors expectations. Then there was acceptance and neighborly love in the air. The message here seems to be that life will be better if you would just comform. I almost gave this movie 3 stars but I decided a Christmas movie shouldn't be irritating. Keep in mind that my wife really liked it. If you're tired of seeing all the better Christmas movies, give this one a chance.",1165017600,5,1177,4.235555555555556

2207814,2,B0007A0F4E,"'Christmas with the Kranks' presents the holiday season with a common ambivalence.  Depending on one's take of Christmas, the season will be a festive celebration, a religious hallmark filled with meaning, or an ordeal filled with nauseating depression.  (For most of us, it is a combination of all three.)  Trying to cope with the forced pleasantries and crass materialism of a season saturated with meaning is a real struggle.  So it is with Nora and Luther Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen).  As empty-nesters they face a particular vacuum when their daughter leaves for the Peace Corps and leave all reason for them to celebrate behind.  Their solution?  Skip the expense of the holiday trimmings and go for a cruise starting Christmas day.  Cynically and brazenly, their neighbors and co-workers won't stand for it.  Like the holiday police, they encroach the Krank's personal space as if they were criminals in the Great Holiday Conspiracy.  Motives seem mixed.  As they start, they save Christmas spending for their cruise, but, later refuse even the free holiday trimmings of Christmas carolers.  What gives?  Luther says, ""It's the principle of the thing...Not even Nick Frohmeyer (M. Emmitt Walsh) can stop us.""  So it's keeping up with the Joneses, then--or in this case the Krank's--and their reputation with the rest of the neighbors.  Included are prankster kids who launch a ""Free Frosty"" campaign for the coveted Krank roof decoration.

'Christmas with the Kranks' really has a frosty look at the holiday season--one that notably warms up as the movie goes on.  One wonders why the Kranks couldn't take a few simple steps to make their Christmas plans easier; one that would combine purposes and take needed short-cuts to their sanity.  But, that, of course, would delete a lot of the comedy.  And, there are some big laughs to be had from this comedy flick.  The previews give us the impression that '...The Kranks' would deliver a sack full of holiday laughs, but at least we get a quality stocking stuffer.  It seems to at least have some heart--even if it does borrow (or steal) some important elements from great Christmas classics, notably 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,' 'Scrooge,' and 'A Charlie Brown Christmas'.  For the latter, there's the scrawny tree bit.  Anyway, for all its redeeming qualities, 'Christmas with the Kranks' presents an inconsistent and jaundiced holiday view that has the effect of tainted eggnog:  It is sweet but leaves a bitter aftertaste.",1162598400,2,2497,5.048899755501222

What is creepy about this movie is that there are actually people like this for real in America. Nosy busy bodies that stick it in everyone's affairs. Passive Agressive nimrods that hide behind a veneer of being such caring individuals. When actually they are seething with rage and jealousy beneath. This movie depicted Middle America very well.

2207827,5,B0007A0F4E,"""Christmas With The Kranks"" was a strange movie to be primarily because it was written by political thriller author John Grisham.  This was NOTHING like any Grisham film or book I've seen!  But I was pleasantly surprised.

The premise of ""skipping Christmas"" is appealing to the Kranks, especially with their daughter Blaire out of the house and in Peru.  So why not save your money and take a trip on a cruise ship to the Bahamas!  What an idea!

But then the nosy and intrusive neighbors catch wind of this scheme about ditching the most wonderful time of the year and lay the guilt trip on the Kranks about it.  Through a series of temptations, the Kranks held firm in their resolve that they wanted to take a year off from Christmas.

That all changed when Blaire and her new fiance Enrique decide to surprise mom and dad by coming home for the holidays.  Uh-oh!  The mad dash to make Christmas happen is too hilarious not to watch this movie to find out what happens next.

The important message of this movie is that you can't skip Christmas.  Whether you allow the commercialism of the holiday to overcome you or if you choose to celebrate it and enjoy it as it is intended to be, Christmas WILL come and impact you year in and year out.  Don't even think about skipping it!

Nice to find a movie that is ""safe"" to watch around kids. not a ""kid"" movie, really, but, it's safe. Lighthearted, fun, a wee bit of slapstick humor.

Love Tim Allen, he was about the same guy that he is in all his movies. The father type that tries hard, but falls short, gets into a jam, and makes us laugh. Yup, that was him in this movie. but, he DID make me laugh. So, worth the price of a ticket. (or a dvd.)

Jamie Lee Curtis, can be annoying, but in this movie, she was sweet, a good complimentary wife to Tim. She is not as funny, but, did fine. She had some good lines too, actually.

The Daughter could have been played by any young 20 ish actress, she didn't get much airtime. Pleasant and cute though, as was the boyfriend that she brought home. He was adorable, but had a very small part.

A neighbor kid was played by Erik Per Sullivanrik, the little brother, Dewey, off Malcolm. Cute funny kid. The Boy Scout leader / nosey neighbor was a HOOT and done perfectly by Dan Aykroyd.

Me and my dear Norman popped some popcorn and cuddled on the sofa to watch this DVD, and we enjoyed it a lot. Not deep, by any means. Just a nice holiday fun.

2207831,5,B0007A0F4E,"Christmas With the Kranks, based on the very amusing novel called ""Skipping Christmas,"" by John Grisham is a hilarious and heartwarming film.  It is surprising that the author of legal thrillers wrote such a humorous book.

Luther and Nora Krank (Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) have always gone all out for Christmas, with a Christmas Eve party, custom-made cards and invitations from the local stationer's, and of course a tree and dinner with Honey Roasted Hickory ham.  But this year is different.  Their twenty-three year old daughter Blair is off to spend a year in South America with the Peace Corps.

Rather than face Nora's empty nest syndrome and depression, Luther books them on a cruise.  All they have to do is skip Christmas.  It sounds easy - and liberating - but the neighbors are aghast.  Led by the powerful Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Ackroyd), the residents begin an all-out assault of Christmas spirit on their supposedly Grinch-like neighbors.  One of the funniest scenes is when a battalion of carolers dressed in Victorian clothes descends on the house, and the measures Luther takes to keep them away.

Tim Allen's character is a waffley version of Winston Smith, with Dan Ackroyd in the role of a softballer Big Brother, and the whole ordeal is a 1984 nightmare metaphorically disguised as a Christmas carol. Individualism rears its ugly head and is ruthlessly pulverized by the forces of mindless conformity which leave Tim Allen babbling about how much he loves Big Brother at the surreal end of the affair (Remember the finale of  Bergman's ""The Magician,""  where it is revealed that the honest-to-God magician is the director of the film?)

2207844,3,B0007A0F4E,"I would recommend, Christmas with the Kranks, is viewed by only people who are looking for a brainless movie to watch late at night, because it doesn't have any extraordinary aspects to it, and because it has no thought provoking values. Furthermore, the acting in very elementary and easy to follow so serves as easy watch.

On the day of November 27, 2005, at 3:30 pm I watched this movie twice through, in my living room, at my house in Bells Flats. This gives me the information and background to be able to review this movie.

By saying a movie is brainless I mean that it doesn't take any brain power before, after or during the movie. Watching the movie is like watching a soap opera, the story line is straight forward, so the mind is at easy watching it.

This movie is basically shot with a wide angle standard lens the entire film. The camera plays no tricks on your eyes and is pretty much straight forward. The scenes are not abstract in anyway. They incorporate no tilt effects or panning effects that make the eye cautious in watching. Most of the scenes are evenly lit and give no suspenseful play to the movie. No special features are brought in such as masking, or a hidden item, that would add any sort of depth to the film. These aspects of film weighted it, it allows for easy watching. Nothing is suspenseful and your eyes become lazily satisfied with the scene. However, being so easy to watch, if it is late you might just fall asleep half way through it.

In film some directors, make the audience guess what is going to happen next. Not in this film. Although there is a plot and a storyline the movie doesn't have the watcher on the edge of their seats asking, ""What is going to happen next?"" It doesn't engage the watcher mind. Therefore it is great for those people who have had a long day and don't really want to engage themselves. Those people also tend to be the people who don't have a long attention span at night, and this movie won't help that.

The acting in this movie proves to be very elementary. The main characters have no up's and down's to their personalities. They have their semi-freak-out moments, but other than that their characters are dry. Not very engaging the characters become normal human beings on screen and are not hard to watch or follow. Not true for all of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allan's movies, but very true for this one. They didn't give the extra oomph that the comedy in this movie needed and therefore the film became dry and a half a laugh movie at most.

2207845,1,B0007A0F4E,Oh don't you love these movies that we are supposed to like? Showing that 'average' American family that goes through a few minor but blown up problems only to come out learning one of those sentimental lessons about the true meaning of Cristmas. I'll tell you what this movie does not tell you - this film is designed to take advantage of your preconceived ideas about the holidays in your typical cookie cutter shaped upper/middle class neighborhood. You laugh when you are supposed to laugh and you go 'awwwwww' when you are supposed to right? This is the perfect profit oriented film - it aims to please and forgets about actual plot. So only see this movie if you are a fan of 'Full House' and other 'acceptable' family movies and rent 'Cheaper by the dozen' while you are at it.

2207846,2,B0007A0F4E,"I read John Grisham's ""Skipping Christmas"" last year and found it to be a complete waste of time, as it seemed to lead in the direction of being a good satire of our materialism run amok, yet at the end endorsing it with a very contrived and unlikely event (the daughter surprising the parents with an engagement to a man she only met a month earlier and wanting to show him what an American Christmas was all about).

It was interesting to me that they didn't even keep the title of the book, even though in the movie, they said a few times, ""skipping Christmas"". My guess is that they decided to change the title because of another holiday film disaster that came out the same year called ""Surviving Christmas"". Gee, that would really confuse the American movie-going audience if two holiday films in 2004 played in multi-plexes called ""Surviving Christmas"" and ""Skipping Christmas"".

The amazon.com writeup for this movie got it wrong. This film is loyal to Grisham's novel, so I don't know what the writer was talking about. That's one of the things I noticed...it is a faithful film adaptation, so John Grisham may be the only one who loves this film because it came from his mind. The critics were right about the film though when they panned it. I kept waiting for the laughs and maybe had two at the most. Tim Allen was funnier in ""The Santa Clause"" and that was another holiday film I didn't particularly like either. What I do like most in this film are Jamie Lee Curtis as the mother and the music choices. Every time Jamie Lee Curtis got excited, she made a sound that I found hysterical and loved hearing. That made the movie for me and saved it from getting one star. I'd also buy the soundtrack because the music is pretty fresh for the most part. In the end, there is a redeeming moment that supposed to make your heart melt by its generosity of the holiday spirit, but all in all, I was hoping to see Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid take on the Kranks for some serious holiday fun. ""Christmas Vacation"" is far superior and high on the funny factor, so skip this one and watch the Griswolds in action!",1134432000,2,2113,4.485714285714286
2207847,4,B0007A0F4E,"Christmas with the Kranks advertised itself as this uproarious slapstick farce, not unlike Christmas Vacation and while its nowhere near as good as that film, it is a decent Christmas film and better than most reviwers give it.

The Kranks Luther and Nora(Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) are somber this Christmas Season because their daughter Blair leaves for South American on a Peace Corps. mission.  Rather spend their usual thousands on Christmas, Luther decides they should use the money to take a Caribbean Cruise and just skip Christmas.  That means no presents, no Christmas Eve Party, no decorations, and no tree.

This does not sit well with the Kranks neighbors who are so obsessed with Christmas that they make Clark Griswold look mild by comparison.  Seems all the residents of their street decorate their homes and each places a big plastic Frosty the Snowman on the roof of their homes.  The neighbors, led by Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Ackroyd) first try to convince the Kranks gently to go along with the neighbors.  Then they become more forceful...staging protests to ""Free Frosty"" on the Kranks front lawn.  Nora starts to bend but Luther is adamant about no Christmas...until they find out that Blair is coming home afterall with her fiancee and they have just hours to get the home decorated and a party thrown together.

The climax becomes a bit sappy as all the neighbors pitch in to help and Luther discovers the true meaning of Christmas, but what Christmas movie isn't just a bit sappy?  That's what Christmas movies are all about.  The film hasa number of funny parts such as when luther's face is numb from Botox injections but the laughs don't come as rapid fire as one might hope.

I give Jaimie Lee Curtis credit for appearing in a bikini.  She has put on a LOT of weight since her days when she did that sexy dance in True Lies.  The cast is filled with wonderful character actors such as M. Emmet Walsh as the Kranks curmudgeonly neighbor, Cheech Marin as a cop, Tom Poston as a priest, and Austin Pendleton as Marty who seems to know everyone even if they don't know him.

The Film is based on a book by John Crisham called ""Skipping Christmas"" and while I never read the book, the consensus seems to be that it was far better than the movie.  Still, there's enough good in the movie to recommend.  My biggest beef would be with the total lack of special features on the DVD.

The ridiculous script has a plot that is simply an excuse to stage a load of of stupid sight gags and the only thing it does for the two stars, big ones I might add, is make them look ridiculous.

2207849,2,B0007A0F4E,"Last year we had polar opposite responses to Christmas with the Kranks: the ""Christian community"" telling us to go see it, and reviewers saying it was terrible.  I saw it last night on video.  Sorry, brothers and sisters in Jesus, but I'm leaning toward the reviewers.

Now I never read Skipping Christmas by John Grisham, and maybe, as usual, the book is better.  The plot of the movie: suburbanite Luther Krank (Tim Allen) and his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) see their only daughter Blair off to the Peace Corps.  When Luther realizes he's spent $6,000 on Christmas last year, and a cruise to the Caribbean costs $3,000, he convinces Nora to ""skip Christmas"" by foregoing their traditional decorations, Christmas Eve party, and gifts, and to leave for the cruise on Christmas morning instead.  Their neighbors are shocked at the Kranks' lack of ""Christmas Spirit"", and a town hotshot (Dan Ackroyd) motivates the neighbors to change the couple's minds.  ""Free Frosty! Free Frosty!"" the kids chant in front of the Krank house, refering to the giant snowman hidden in the basement.

Ackroyd's character wants the Kranks to display their Frosty like everyone else.  Luther subbornly fights back by, among other things, hosing his sidewalk so carolers slip on the subsequent ice and the neighbor's cat becomes a meowing ice sculpture.  However, when daughter Krank calls and announces she is coming home for Christmas, plans suddenly change.

This movie could have been a wonderful farce.  Unfortunately, Christmas with the Kranks is terribly uneven: not farcical enough for a long stretch, then suddenly farcical to the nth degree.

There is a truly heartwarming sentimental scene near the end which displays a true spirit of community and cooperation.  Community is a wonderful Christian value--but so are honesty, tolerance, and freedom.  Why aren't those values so honored as people are encouraged to lie to each other and to pressure their neighbors into conforming?  Why couldn't the Kranks tell their daughter: ""Honey, we didn't know you were coming home, and we made other plans.  Now let's sit down and figure out what to do.""

I'm also bothered that the Kranks--Luther, anyway--felt they had to chuck their Christmas spirit along with their traditional Christmas plans.  How would their neighbors have reacted if they had said, ""We're celebrating Christmas differently this year?""  One can refuse the traditional hoopla and still accept a greeting of ""Merry Christmas!"" from a neighbor.  The characters, and perhaps the creators of this movie, need a serious reading of the book Unplug the Christmas Machine. (Of course, this is more of a value point than a moviemaking point.)

All that said, Christmas with the Kranks might make a good double feature with Jingle All the Way, another holiday movie that can't tell Christmas trappings from Christmas spirit.  And when a movie is not even as good as Jingle All the Way--and Jingle All the Way could be taken as a decent farce, BTW--then Christmas with the Kranks must be pretty bad.",1134172800,2,3040,5.0602409638554215

The Kranks live in a neighborhood inhabited by Christmas Nazis - evil elves whose idea of holiday spirit is making all the residents put up a tacky lighting display on the front of their houses... or suffer the consequences!  (I would surely hate to be a Jewish person living on this street).  When Luther and Nora make the fatal mistake of foregoing Christmas (their daughter has joined the Peace Corps and won't be home for the holidays), all hell breaks loose in the community, with all the resident goons attempting to strong arm and browbeat the benighted couple into submission.  Where's good old Scrooge when you need him?

Watching ""Christmas With the Kranks"" is like finding a lump of coal in your stocking on Christmas morning; it makes you wonder what bad thing you did to deserve it.  Instead of love and good cheer, we're treated to a witless holiday farce replete with labored slapstick and fake snow.  All these neighborhood buttinskis are so annoying and irritating that they make you want to scream ""Get a life!"" every time they commit another holiday-related atrocity.  Actually, given a more courageous set of filmmakers and a better script, ""Christmas With the Kranks"" might have been a slashing little satire on Christmas materialism (on the order of, say, a ""Bad Santa""); instead, it turns all feel-goody and mushy, converting the vicious neighbors into goody-two-shoe, Santa's Little Helper-types in time for the tear-soaked finale.

Screenwriter Chris Columbus and director  Joe Roth go for the lowbrow, easy laugh every time.  Columbus even seems to be trying for a bit of that old ""Home Alone"" magic again by bringing in a couple of bumbling cops and a light-fingered jewel thief who burgles the upstairs bedrooms while a Christmas Eve party is in full swing below.  Nothing works in this film, not the premise, not the humor, not the sentiment.  The saddest thing is that the film wastes the talents of Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmett Walsh, and Cheech Marin among others who probably signed on believing they were creating a Christmas classic that would live on through the ages.  Instead, it joins all those other seasonal misfires like ""Santa Claus- The Movie,"" ""Jingle All the Way"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""  Ah well, you can always serve this instead of a stuffed bird for Christmas dinner.  At least this turkey is not fattening.",1134172800,12,2400,4.9181141439205955
2207851,2,B0007A0F4E,"Christmas with the Kranks is an ok Christmas movie that should have done better considering the talent involved in the cast. With Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Akroyd and a good support group this should have been funnier but the script didn't try hard enough.

Curtis and Allen are a married couple who decide to skip Christmas because their only daughter has gone off to the Peace Corp. They decide to spend the money on a cruise and to make the experience complete they don't put up a tree or decorate or send out cards or any of the usual Christmas things people do. The neighborhood they live is horrified at their decision and put constant pressure on them to conform and celebrate the holiday as usual. They resist, but on Christmas Eve their daughter calls and tells them she is coming home for Christmas. So, with the help of the same neighbors they have been feuding with, they throw everything together at the last minute so she will never know they were going to skip Christmas.

The idea is an interesting one, but the script didn't go far enough with the jokes. Every scene seems to be cut short of being funny, like a fighter pulling his punches. You'll get some enjoyment out of watching it as you can enjoy a great cast and the look of the film, but a different writer could have made this a truly funny movie instead of a tepid one.",1134000000,2,1353,4.451612903225806
2207852,3,B0007A0F4E,"First, I would like to say that I would give this 3.5 stars if possible. I read Skipping Christmas for about three Christmas' in a row before this year when I recently watched Christmas with the Kranks. I expected it to be the quality of a straight-to-video movie with no style whatsoever.

However, my entire family liked it as I watched it with them, especially my mother who doesn't understand English all too well. It's nice seeing Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis again after seemingly so long. They fit very well in the nice little film.

*SEMI-SPOILER*

I think the movie should have been about 10 to 15 minutes longer to help you really appreciate what the neighbors did for the Kranks near the end. Because of it's short length, it just seemed too unbelievable. But it was still nice to see it all happen.

2207853,3,B0007A0F4E,"While not as awful as some of the critics have said, this is movie has enough problems to be just an OK mindless entertainment.  It isn't enough to provide a treacely sweet ending to pull this one out of the fire.  Still, if you want to kill a couple of hours and you like Tim Allen, Jamie Curtis (and who doesn't), well, you could do worse.

The idea is that that Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora (Jamie Curtis) Krank are part of a neighborhood that really puts on a Christmas show every year and the Kranks are at the forefront of that effort.  It turns out with their decorations, parties, donations, presents, cards, and so forth they spend over six thousand dollars per year.  As the movie opens they are saying goodbye to their daughter, Blair (played by the appropriately transcendently beautiful Julie Gonzalo), who is going to serve in the Peace Corps in Peru.

As the parents mope about being alone for Christmas Luther has a vision about skipping Christmas, saving a few thou and taking a cruise instead.  However, his idea to skip Christmas is bizarrely stringent and ends up making everyone they know upset beyond belief.  The leader of the neighborhood who is one Vic Frohmeyer (done to a turn by Dan Ackroyd - I like him even if certain folks really don't).  Why this whole thing has to get as far out of hand as it does is certainly due to plot needs rather than anything a real person or people would do and that is part of the movie's problem.

Also, I really don't like the patronizing view that mid-westerners are this mindless conforming bunch of hicks with bad taste and a profound inability to reason.  Oh, they may have a good heart, but it is a sort of a kindly idiot they portray.  As a lifelong mid-westerner, this is absolutely not anything like the life I have lived or seen lived around here.  Groupthink affects the coasts a lot more than it does here, in my experience.  Anyway, back to the movie.

Mayhem ensues when Blair announces she is on her way home to celebrate Christmas and is bringing her fianc, Enrique (played well by Ren Lavan).  You have to see the rest of the movie to get the punch lines.  However, just realize that none of it is really going to be believable or transcendently funny.  The beast just cranks along (wink, wink) and extrudes its ending.

So, if you are willing to view this with low expectations, you can have an ok experience, but that is about it.  It has much more to do with the screenplay than the performers.  They all work hard with what little they were given and I credit them for that.",1133654400,,2555,4.463362068965517

A couple sends their daughter off (I think to college or on a intership)so they decide since she is not going to be home for the traditional Christmas celebration that they would take the money that they would spend on Christmas and take a trip together. Well, OK there is certainly nothing wrong with that but what annoyed the heck out of me was why not just say you took the trip as a Christmas present instead of insisting your skipping Christmas.  Taking a trip together shows courtship and compassion for one another, skipping Christmas on the other hand is not compassionate and grinch-like.  So basically the whole movie is nothing other than the neighbors and co-workers highlighting how terrible the couple are for ""skipping Christmas"" and not carrying out the traditional celebration.  The last 10 minutes or the ending if you will, was the only heart felt moment through the whole movie.  Sorry, try again.",1133481600,4,978,4.832335329341317

This movie DOES not live up to the book and I can only hope Tim Allen escapes this holiday fiasco with his job. The movie takes place around the holidays.

Being described as ""Scrooges"" even in their local newspaper. The Kranks deal with a variety of stupid and outrageous situations.

In the end, it IS a Christmas movie and it IS for the Holiday season so it's hard to hate it, still, I think it'll be down near the end of my collection.",1131840000,,639,5.009433962264151

2207873,5,B0007A0F4E,"I read the book a few years back and was mesmerized by the story. My husband and I (we have no kids) had talked for years about ""foregoing"" Christmas...but never did because we knew our parents and siblings would protest too much. So, the book was an appealing story to us since it expressed our own thoughts and feelings about Christmas. As soon as the movie was out, we rushed to see it. Granted, it's no ""Christmas Vacation"" with Chevy Chase (but no movie is or ever will be); yet this movie is quite hysterical and entertaining. It truly brought the book to life, giving the characters dimension and bringing the Christmas spirit into full view. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, the movie does leave you thinking about what you believe Christmas should be in your own life. I (we) highly recommend buying this movie and making it a 'regular' part of your holiday season year after year.",1131840000,13,908,4.611111111111111
2207874,3,B0007A0F4E,"Hmmm, This one is kind of a toss-up, on one side, you've got Jamie Lee Curtis, who is still gorgeous and still a pretty decent comic actress. Then on the other side, we have Tim Allen, who I have not liked in anything except for a few Home Improvement episodes (Ok, i'll give him Galaxy Quest, but Sigourney Weaver's cleavage had alot to do with that as well)

So, I think I'll do the half full glass thing here and rave on about Mrs. Curtis....She is adorable in every scene, her facial expressions and comic timing really shine in this. Also, it looks like she really enjoyed making the movie, cuz the woman never stopped smiling. Tim Allen sleepwalks through alot of it, even his scenes alone look like they were really forced and not very ""funny""

Another reason this gets 3 stars instead of 2 is a very strong supporting cast, Dan Akroyd is priceless as the at first upset then helpfull understanding neighbor, and Cheech Marin is also very good as a cop not too thrilled with Mr. Allen's decision to skip Christmas. Of course we have M. Emmett Walsh (how many frickin movies has this guy been in, 100? maybe even 200?) stealing a few scenes as he always does as another unhappy neighbor.

But it's Curtis that steals it, I hear she has decided to stop acting, I hope this isn't true, because she is still wonderfull and can always help an average movie reach a bigger audience.

So, again, not a terrible movie, some laughs here and there, and with the pathetic choices we have for holiday movies these days, you really won't have any regrets renting this, enjoy it for what it is, a simple holiday comedy with some sweet touches, kids will love it, parents will tolerate it.

acting............3 stars, Allen's a bore, Curtis is solid

directing.........3 stars, Simple, easy to not make mistakes

special effects...n/a , None to really get into to

2207875,4,B0007A0F4E,"I liked the movie but not nearly as well done as the book,there was just a different feeling to t. I really don't expect a movie to have the details a book can but it could be a little closer than this. The Krank's daughter, Blair, is going someplace Christmas holiday. The dad, Luther, [Tim Allen] decides to skip Christmas and go on a cruise, because, without her, Christmas won't be the same. The wife, Nora [ Jamie Lee Curtis], decides to do that too. But the neighborhood is filled with Christmas-loving people that are PO'd to see them skipping Christmas. Later, they learn Blair is coming home for Christmas tonight. So they have to prepare the house for Christmas",1131753600,,671,4.6
2207876,2,B0007A0F4E,"The premise for ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is established early on when Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis), put their only child Blair (Julie Gonzalo) on a plane to Peru to work with the Peace Corps.  Facing their first Christmas without their daughter, Luther crunches the numbers and discovers that last year they spent over $6K on Christmas.  Since Blair will not be around this year he proposes they spend half that money on a cruise of the Caribbean.  Does that still leave the other half of that money to be spent on Christmas?  No, it does not, because Luther decides that he and Nora should go cold turkey and spend nothing on Christmas.

At this point this 2004 holiday comedy goes off track in two important ways.  First, the catalyst for Luther's proposal is presented as being the money that was spent and not the fact that his daughter will not be home.  In other words, without Blair, Christmas just will not be Christmas.  But, no, this is just about the money.  This is proven because, as you all know from the trailer, the best laid plains of mice and Luther go astray when Blair announces at the last minute she is coming home.  Second, deciding to go on the trip, which seems to be an eminently reasonable decision under the circumstances, does not mean the Kranks should forgo basic things like sending out Christmas cards, making charitable donations, or having a tree.

This becomes a problem because in the Kranks' neighborhood everybody goes overboard when it comes to decorating for Christmas.  So when the Kranks decide they are going to do nothing this year for Christmas, the block Nazi, Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd), organizes the neighbors against the Kranks.  These means pickets and harassing phone calls about freeing the giant Frosty figure in the basement, and a story in the newspaper declaring the Kranks public pariahs.  Consequently, there is really no one to root for in this film.  The neighbors who insist that the Kranks conform or else push several buttons while Luther's insistence that they do nothing is pretty stupid.  Every Christmas card that shows up from family and friends should be enough to prove that point.  But, no, Luther has to continue to be stupid because that is the way this story goes.

In terms of comedy most of it is rather mean spirited for a Christmas movie, although since Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") did the screenplay that adapted John Grisham's Dickensian novella ""Skipping Christmas,"" the level of slapstick had to be expected.  But Grisham's satire is swamped by the resulting carnage and when some sentimentality and magic are thrown into the final act, neither plays well.  The fact that there are no deleted scenes on the DVD is disquieting because it suggests director Joe Roth was not discriminating when it came to what he put into this movie.  The most painful act turns out to be the second one, when Luther and Nora have to try and provide Blair a traditional Kranks Christmas at the last minute, and the humor really falls flat at the point when it should have been going into overdrive.

I sort of like the idea that Tim Allen is trying to be the King of Christmas movies and I certainly enjoyed seeing Jamie Lee Curtis in a bikini even if she thinks we should not, but the net result of watching ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was disappointment.  Even though it is early for watching holiday movies--the official viewing period begins on Thanksgiving and has to start with the original ""Miracle on 34th Street (in black & white if I have to tell you)--I had to put on ""The Santa Claus"" to get this one out of my system and remind me that contemporary Christmas films really can hit all the right notes.",1131753600,3,3708,4.714728682170542

The characters remained throughout cardboard figures. And Tim allen and Jamie Lee Curtis seemed to be reading their lines.  I have to admit I didn't think the book was that great either but I thought (hoped) the movie would be better.  It was worse.

2207879,2,B0007A0F4E,"Christmas with the Kranks:

Okay, I read John Grisham's Skipping Christmas about four years ago and thought it was so incredibly funny.  I told everyone I knew that it was a great book and that I couldn't wait for it to be made into a movie.  I knew it would eventually happen...

Well, it did and I was not impressed.  I think this movie tries too hard.  I don't know, maybe the book should have been left alone and not made into a movie.  I think the movie stays pretty true to the book, although I can't exactly remember ALL of the details of the book because it has been so long since I read it.  It just doesn't transfer well to film.  Maybe it was bad direction...  Or maybe it was bad acting...  Whatever it was, it ruined the movie, in my opinion.

I normally don't mind Tim Allen, and I don't think he was all that bad in this movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis, on the other had, just didn't come off as very funny.  Well, not as often as she should have anyway.  Yes, some of her scenes/lines were funny, but not enough of them.  Sometimes I found her to be just plain annoying!  Dan Aykroyd did well in his role, as I think he usually does.

On to the movie: Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis play Luther and Nora Krank.  The Kranks are spending their first Christmas alone without their daughter who has gone off to Peru with the Peace Corps.  Not looking forward to spending the holiday without their daughter and deciding that they normally spend way too much on Christmas anyway, Luther books them on a 10-day Caribbean cruise for which they are scheduled to depart at noon on Christmas Day.

What follows is a six-week preparation for the cruise, including trips to a tanning salon.  (The scenes for this, by the way, just weren't funny for some reason.  Except for the ""oompa loompa"" looking salon operator.  She was funny!)  And Luther and Nora begin explaining to friends, neighbors and co-workers that they are ""skipping Christmas"".  As you can guess, no one takes this well and as things become very tense between the Kranks and their very-into-tradition neighbors, the phone rings and it's their daughter Blair announcing that she is coming home for Christmas after all.

Luther and Nora begin to frantically prepare a party and get their house decorated as if it had been that way all along so Blair will never know about the cruise.  Many things go wrong during this time and eventually the neighbors find out that Blair is coming home and soon enough they are all working together to get Luther and Nora's party and house before her arrival.  Who doesn't love a happy ending?

The last half-hour or so of this movie (not including end credits) was the best, in my opinion.  I really can't believe that a movie taken almost exactly from such a funny novel could be this bad.  I guess if you're like me and you read the book and just have to see it for yourself then you should.  Judge it for yourself.  Honestly, I think it could have been really good.  I'm not sure what could have done the trick though.",1131494400,4,3017,4.443430656934306

2207884,3,B0007A0F4E,"Based on the best-selling John Grisham novel titled Skipping Christmas, Christmas With The Kranks resembles the book in almost every facet save for the title. Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, Christmas With The Kranks is an instant Christmas holiday classic. Although not in the same league of Yule tide comedy gems Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Story, this film ranks high on my list of holiday laughers. The supporting cast (led by perpetual funnyman Dan Aykroyd) turns in a superb performance, making Christmas With The Kranks an easy film to relate to and one you'll want to see many times in the years to come...

When the college-age daughter of the Kranks joins the Peace Corps and flies to South America for Christmas, her mother battles with a case of the empty nest blues. But her father, accountant Luther Krank (Tim Allen), takes advantage of the opportunity to shake things up a bit. Tallying all the money he and his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) spend on Christmas, he determines that if they skip Christmas this year, they can afford to go on a week-long cruise instead and still pocket three thousand dollars in savings at the end of the trip.

But skipping Christmas turns out to be more difficult than they thought - especially when it comes to participating in neighborhood traditions such as the mounting of the roof-bound 'Frosties' (giant snowmen all the neighbors plant on their roofs). The neighborhood struggle over the Kranks' reluctance to put up their Frosty leads to some memorable and quite funny scenes where the couple encounters Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd), the de facto leader of the neighborhood Christmas celebration. The Kranks continue to avoid all things Christmas related, and having visiting the tanning salon, they're prepared to go on their cruise Christmas Eve.

But when their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) calls with the announcement that she's getting married, and more importantly, that she's on a plane bound for home - the Kranks are forced to miss their cruise and recreate all the festivities of Christmas Past for Blair and her fiance. But attempting to do a whole month's preparation in one evening proves to be a monumental task, and one filled with hilarious pitfalls and obstacles...

Offering hilarious scene after hilarious scene, Christmas With The Kranks is one of the funniest comedies in years, and certainly one of the top ten Christmas comedies of all time. At no time does the humor become outlandish or utterly ridiculous as so many such films tend to do. Overall, one of the more lovable aspects of this film is its ability to relate to so many American families. In fact, you might see a bit of your own family in Christmas With The Kranks... The fact that it's one of those rare holiday classics with the potential to be seen year after year makes Christmas With The Kranks a definite must-see movie...

Kranks can relate to many everyday families that prepare for Christmas but also find it to be a pain. When the Kranks decide to skip Christmas because their daughter is in Peru things go crazy with their Christmas loving neighborhood. The neighborhood might remind you of your own, dinner parties and treats around the holidays. Imagine telling your neighbors and coworkers that instead of celebrating Christmas you are skipping out. The laughter begins and stays heavy throughout the end of the movie.

I definitely recommend this to be bought on DVD because of the classic it will become, and how much each age group can get clean fun out of the film.",1109116800,2,1067,4.489690721649485
2207887,3,B0007A0F4E,"CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is a slapstick Christmas comedy movie. It revolves around Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis). Luther and Nora's one and only child, daughter Blair, leaves on Thanksgiving weekend to begin a two-year stint in the Peace Corp. Both are sad to see their little girl go. However, Luther quickly moves on with life while Nora pines away missing her little girl. Christmas has always been a family event for the Kranks and this year it just won't be the same. With that in mind, Luther gets a brilliant idea. He begins totally up how much money he spent of Christmas the year before and finds it was in excess of $6,000. Then he looks into some Caribbean cruises and finds one that leaves on Christmas day that cost less than $3,000 for a week of prepaid luxury for two. After presenting the idea to Nora and agreeing to make annual donations to charity, they agree that this year they will skip Christmas and go on a cruise instead. But the friendly neighbors aren't so keen on the idea. Not only that, but little Blair has a few surprises of her own in store.

CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is based off the John Grisham novel, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and in fact was originally entitled SKIPPING CHRISTMAS. The movie stays fairly close to the book. However, there are a few minor things that have been changed. Also, there are some instances where scenes from the book have been played over the top for comic effect. Also, some might be turned off because some scenes taken directly from the book loose much of their literary appeal when presented on the screen. It's something that happens quite often when a book is made into a movie and is no reason for concern, but people should be aware of it.

Tim Allen makes a great movie Dad and Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job as Nora Crank, although it's hard to believe Curtis is old enough to be anyone's mother--she's still as trim and beautiful as ever. The movie is filled with guest appearances with everyone from Cheech Marin playing a local police officer to Tom Poston as the priest of the community parish. Dan Aykroyd also has a major role as the leader of the neighborhood community group.

CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS is a movie that older audiences will probably enjoy more than younger ones. There isn't any potty humor, hardly any bad language, no promiscuous sex, and only cartoon violence. It's the type of humor than many younger audience members going through adolescence aren't able to appreciate for some reason. However, those with more mature sensibilities can appreciate the movie for the funny slapstick moments it contains which brings to mind the comedy of old.

CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS isn't a great movie. However, it never pretends to be. It's just a plain good old fashioned Christmas comedy.",1106179200,,2801,4.686991869918699

Ahh, the most wonderful time of the year. What more than to relax in a theater while watching a Christmas movie? ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was the suitable choice for us. We watched... only to be met with such disappointment.

The Kranks, played by Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, decide to skip out on Christmas since their daughter joined a Peace Corps. and flew to Peru. Luther Krank (Tim Allen) then brought up the bright idea of going on a cruise for Christmas. His wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) disagreed but then reluctantly accepted. Both then told the neighbors and Luther told his co-workers that they will not be celebrating Christmas. Unfortunately, the neighbors and co-workers highly objected to their decision and, in my view, made the Kranks' life miserable. Luther's co-workers all of a sudden despise him (one calling him ""Mr. Scrooge"") and the neighbors try to stop the Kranks from going. In this town, Christmas means everything to everyone, and the Kranks' decision seems to be a sin.

This is nothing short of utter stupidity. The neighbors only treat Christmas as a time of having homes decorated and throwing parties. They try to get the Kranks to put up a Frosty statue on their rooftop just so everyone can be happy. They actually go as far as going in the Kranks' frontyard and protest (""Free Frosty! Free Frosty!"") and even putting their story on the frontpage of a newspaper. They just torment these poor people throughout the whole movie.. err... well, pretty much the whole movie.

But then things take an ""unexpected"" twist when the Kranks' daughter phones in on Christmas Eve and tells 'em she's coming home. She has a new man with her that she'd wanna introduce and mentions if they're still throwing their party. Nora contemplates and reluctantly says, ""Yes."" Luther is pissed off, but Nora is even more pissed when she calls his idea a ""stupid idea."" She was all for a cruise, then she radically shifts and calls it a bad idea. Huh?

So then they try to plan for a party at the last minute. It's hell for them since they're on their own, then the neighbors decide to ""forgive"" them and also lend a hand.

The movie fails to recognize what Christmas is all about. To these characters, Christmas is all about the purty decorations and parties. That's not what Christmas is about. It's about being together as a family and a continuous celebration of the birth of Christ. Religion is a major factor in Christmas, but to these people, ""Frosty"" is of higher importance than Jesus. Decorations mean much more than just simply being together with your OWN family. Hell, even ""The Grinch"" told the true meaning of Christmas (y'know, when the Grinch realizes that it's not about gifts, decorations, and all that wonderful stuff).

Jamie Lee Curtis, although I have high respect for her, horridly overacts on this movie. It's enough to make you cringe and know that such a fine actor (er... actress) can still make a bad movie. But in this movie, she truly lives up to her name as the ""Scream Queen."" Yeah, expect a LOT of that in this movie alone.

Although I did laugh a few times in this movie, the last half of it dulls down when I realized how stupid this movie is. Surely John Grisham's novel ""Skipping Christmas"" (which this movie is based on) is a much better read. He's probably thinking, ""Oh God, what happened here?? This isn't what my book is all about!""

This movie is by far THE worst movie I've seen this year. I never thought I'd do this so soon, but this is the first ""item"" that gets one star from me. I kinda leaned towards two stars, but realizing how Christmas isn't celebrated the way it should've been in this movie, it's a stupid and horrible movie.

Go watch some of these more enjoyable Christmas movies instead:

Elf

The Nightmare Before Christmas

Scrooged

Trading Places

Die Hard

Home Alone

Bad Santa

...hell, even ""Friday After Next"" was much more enjoyable than this garbage. Go watch a Christmas movie other than this garbage or save your money and buy your significant other, sibling, or friend a nice gift.",1102809600,16,4214,4.66531713900135
2207896,2,B0007A0F4E,Everything in this movie could be told in 30 minutes. It is extremely silly but has a good ending.,1102377600,3,98,4.2105263157894735
2207897,2,B0007A0F4E,"Not every movie needs to have a succinct message to be successful. Mindless entertainment can be fun (just don't let that be ALL you allow yourself). However, when a movie such as this comes along with nearly zero redeeming qualities and makes millions and gets four and five star reviews, it's possible the masses are the mindless ones and Hollywood's just catering to you.

When the Kranks announce they want to take a cruise rather than spend twice what a cruise costs on Christmas, their neighbors react as if the Kranks are off their rocker. Well, they are, but only because they choose to live in a neighborhood like this! I understand the neighbors MUST act this way--otherwise, there's no movie. But, what could have been a little commentary on what our society has become in regards to consumerism, etc., and Christmas, turns into a celebration of the neighbors' freakish behavior.

No one wins in this film. The Kranks are reduced to sniveling, groveling idiots and the neighbors come off as Nazis. The tacked on sentimental ending is TOTALLY unearned.

I know someone is going to come along and say, ""Get over yourself--it's just a movie, relax and enjoy."" Well, no! I couldn't enjoy junk such as this if I tried. I was blessed with a brain. I just wish more moviegoers (not just American moviegoers--garbage like this makes millions overseas, too) would stop shelling out their hard-earned cash for the stuff Hollywood is spoonfeeding them. Stop them from making the rest of us think that you're lemmings that think a movie is ""cute"" or ""hilarious"" just 'cause they tell you it is.

As I said, mindless entertainment can be fun (see ""Elf"" or ""A Christmas Story"" for funny and not overly-taxing-on-the-brain Christmas films). But, there's mindless and then there's brain dead.

The few small laughs in ""...Kranks"" are generated by scenes you've already seen in the trailer and/or commercials.

2207898,2,B0007A0F4E,"I went into this movie expecting the best. Tim Allen is always enjoyable, and he always puts out a feel good movie. Although Allen was excellent, and this movie did make me feel good, Allen could not cover for all the characters, including Dan Akyroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jake Busey. Beside's Cheech Marin, there were NO other funny or good characters. The somewhat creepy music just got irritating, and all of the funny parts were in the commercial. Just because a movie delves in a few gut chuckles, that doesn't mean it's funny. This is a disgraceful, barely passable Christmas comedy, that just didn't do it for me. Do me a favor, get some popcorn, go to your local video store, And just rent Elf, with Will Ferrell. NOW THAT IS A CHRISTMAS MOVIE! And, if you're looking for another excellent Tim Allen Christmas film, watch The Santa Clause, 1994, again.

Director Joe Ruth manages to bring Scrooge and Mrs. Clause together in this hilarious story about two people who try to do the impossible. And, no one could do this better then Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. What starts off as a great idea soon turns into a frosty nightmare as Mr. and Mrs. Krank attempt to skip Christmas? Their neighbors are, of course, not pleased. Who would think of such an idea? I don't think there was one flaw in this one. From start to finish, it is very funny. I definitely enjoyed it. Who would think that Tim Allen would turn out to be the bad Santa? Jamie Lee Curtis really stole the show, though. This really is a Christmas movie like no other.

Sure, there are a few laughs here and there and my wife e.g. loved the movie, and she said it was really funny. But the bottom line is that my holiday season would have been just as funny without ever seeing this movie. Maybe my expectations were just a bit too high.",1101686400,,615,4.090909090909091
2207904,3,B0007A0F4E,"There are only a few, at least to me anyway, films that are true holiday classics. This latest film to delve into the holiday themed movie will probably not be one of them. Not that it doesn't deliver on the holiday fun or give you that warm, gooey holiday feeling, because it does, but the movie will not hold up as well as the book it's based on will. John Grisham wrote the book ""Skipping Christmas"", but the movie had to change it's name so as not to be confused with the recent Ben Affleck bomb, ""Surviving Christmas"". 'Kranks' is pretty faithful to the book, although there are a number of small things that were left out, or things that were there but were written in a different way. Tim Allen stars as Luther Krank, an accountant who realizes that he and his wife Nora(Jamie Lee Curtis) spent over $6,000 dollars on Christmas the previous year. Horrified, Luther comes up with a plan. Their only daughter Blair has joined the peace core and is being shipped off to Peru. Luther realizes that since everything is different, and the house is empty, that he and the wife should skip Christmas this year, and take that annual holiday money and spend it on themselves by taking a sun filled cruise to the carribbean. Easier said than done. Once word spreads around their close knit, heavily ran neighborhood, and the town, Luther and Nora realize that foregoing the holiday will be tougher than they had originally thought. But things go really wrong when Blair calls and says she is coming home for Christmas, and The Kranks have to make a mad dash to throw the holidays together in less than a day. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are perfectly cast as Luther and Nora. Tim can really be Luther, and Jamie Lee brings to life Nora's sweetness, although her giddiness throughout the movie makes it seem like she might sometimes need ritalin. Dan Aykroyd, who we haven't seen in a while, plays neighbor Vic Frohmeyer, a guy who pretty much keeps tight reins on the block. The hectic and chaos of the film and the holiday really show how crazy it all can get. The ending shows that family and friends and loved ones are what it is really important. Not tons of presents or anything else. The movie definitley has the look and spirit of a Christmas favorite, but the movie is sometimes wobbly and sometimes as cheap looking as tinsel. That being sad, the movie is fun and charming in it's own way, and there are a few hearty laughs. Tim's Botox incident springs to mind. The joy of the season with the lights and snow and music was nicely executed, and it does give you that warm Christmas feeling. The ending is big and sweet, and while a lot of people will call it schmaltzy or whatever, it's still nice. Who cares if there's a little bit of schmaltz?. It never hurt anybody. What I realized after seeing it, was how fast it all got together. The book seemed to take longer, but throwing Christmas back together again came so fast. Extra kudos must go to Jamie Lee for baring it in a skimpy bikini. She is not the Jamie Lee from long ago anymore, but she has the guts to show to the world her figure as it is and isn't one of these surgically enhanced dolls with hardly a flaw on their whole body. Good for you Jamie Lee. Rounding out the cast are M. Emmett Walsh, Cheech Marin, Jake Busey, Erik Per Sullivan from ""Malcolm In The Middle"", Tom Poston, Caroline Rhea, and ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman. The Kranks may not be the people you want to visit every Christmas, but a one stop visit for the holidays won't hurt anybody.",1101513600,9,3543,4.486068111455109
2207905,4,B0007A0F4E,"Being a big fan of Christmas-themed movies and having read the John Grisham novel on which this was based, I was definitely looking forward to this movie.  Therefore, despite Ebert's bad review,  I convinced my family to see it after our Thanksgiving dinner.  With two kids in college now, there aren't many chances for us to all go to a movie together.  And maybe there's another reason for that----generational gap in taste.  My husband and I enjoyed this alot, while our two offspring agreed it was probably the worst movie they had ever seen.  There you have it, mixed reviews.

While it's true there is no earth-shaking revelation in this one (unless you count a reaffirmation of the true meaning of Christmas), no high-tech wizardry, no spectacular chase scenes, no lusty sex or mind-numbing profanity, I found this a most enjoyable way to spend an afternoon.  What it did have was a look at the importance of family, friends, and community.  What it did have was honest laughter and the realization that only an idiot would try to forego the most important holiday of all.  The fact that the neighborhood looked more like one from 1954 instead of 2004 only added to the enjoyment for me.  After all, nostalgia is a large part of the holiday, right?

For those unfamiliar with the story, Luther Krank (Tim Allen) is upset to realize that the cost of Christmas is about $6,000.  A bit sad since his only child is now in the Peace Corps and will not be home for Christmas, he convinces his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) that it would be foolish to spend all that money on decorations, donations, gifts, and their annual Christmas Eve bash.  For less money, they could take a Caribbean cruise and enjoy life in the islands.  Skipping Christmas sounds, at first, like a brilliant idea.  But the neighbors won't allow it.  Led by neighborhood watchdog Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd), they insist on upholding traditions (like putting a giant Frosty on every rooftop) and do not take at all kindly to the Kranks' breaking with the wishes of the neighborhood.  The twist comes at the last minute when the daughter decides she can't miss the Christmas celebrations she has always loved and flies in from Peru with her fiance.  How will the Kranks explain the darkened house, no tree, no Frosty, and the fact they are sailing at noon?

While it is not the greatest Christmas movie I've ever seen, I did enjoy this one and recommend it for those not jaded by recent Hollywood offerings.  If you like good clean movies that leave you smiling, this one's for you.",1101513600,151,2553,4.692134831460674
2207906,3,B0007A0F4E,"Christmas With the Kranks was a disappointing comedy.  What was supposed to be a laugh a minute type of flick turned out to be a somewhat weak plotline based on John Grisham's Skipping Christmas.  The trailer for the film did a better job at providing the laughs, and the overall film had too many sub plotlines that did not appear to gel into the film too well.

If you're are interested in the holiday fair and the spirit of Christmas, the film provides that as an incentive -- Christmas regalia, snow falling, Santa,Frosty, and Mel's Honey Ham.  Yes, Tim Allen provides the laughs, but Nora, played by Jamie Curtis, is annoying and whiney.  It's unfortunate that Dan Akroyd had a bit part. However, as most films of this genre go, the sentimental parts of the film appear during the concluding scenes of the film.

So, after the turkey's gone and the holiday shopping has been done, when time to choose a film to relax and giggle to, you might want to catch Christmas with the Kranks after a bit or two of egg nog.",1101427200,5,1017,4.5
