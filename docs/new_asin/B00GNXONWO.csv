8625194,1,B00GNXONWO,"Claim ""Region Free"" NOT True.

Error message that this Blu-Ray can only be played on Region B players contrary to the description that it is Region Free. I had invited friends to watch. Now I have to look for a local version of the disc and must return this one.
Major disappointment. I have been an Amazon Prime Member mostly satisfied and could purchase with confidence. Again, this is a major blow.",1523664000,4,401,4.569444444444445

8625196,1,B00GNXONWO,"As a Prime member, I can't tell you how disappointed I am that Amazon would ship to me in United States a blu ray disc made to only be seen in REGION B. I suppose it's just coincidence that it happened with a sales-history-making movie. I've purchased many movies from Amazon advance of their release date, with no problem. Maybe the pace your growth is taking a toll.",1519084800,6,368,4.426470588235294
