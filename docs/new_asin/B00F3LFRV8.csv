8611977,5,B00F3LFRV8,I've watched the movie Silver Bullet dozens of times online and wanted to purchase the DVD so I ordered it from Amazon since the price was very reasonable for two movies!! I've never seen Graveyard Shift so I was happy to have it included. The overall quality of the DVD was great! Sound and picture were just as they should be and I received my items in just 2 days from original order date.. I'm still a happy customer of Amazon:-),1498003200,,433,4.3580246913580245
8611978,5,B00F3LFRV8,"I have always been a fan of these 2 movies, particularly Silver Bullet, but Graveyard Shift is solid too. I remember watching Silver Bullet as a kid and it was one of the first movies that got me into monsters / werewolves back then. Very simple story line yet well acted and done. Same for Graveyard Shift, cant go wrong with this combo!",1490659200,,338,4.380952380952381

8611982,5,B00F3LFRV8,"This is a great Stephen King entry that is made a bit more macabre knowing that the poor kid in the wheelchair,
actually, HAS passed into the nethermost netherworld. Corey's life gave NEW meaning to lost boys and silver-
bullets.
I recommend T-H-I-S double feature---until a Blu-ray comes out---over the single; triple; and quad-feature DVD-
versions.
What a great werewolf movie... with a few extra twists and turns.",1465084800,,417,5.147058823529412

8611984,4,B00F3LFRV8,"Silver Bullet
I remember watching this as a kid and it scared me so much that I can't watch any movie with werewolves.  Well, I still can't.  I got halfway through and turned it off.  Apparently childhood fears took over and that night I had nightmares.  (How embarrassing!)
Graveyard Shift
I also watched it as a kid but was then 5 years older.  I didn't find it nearly as scary, as an adult I'm not impressed with the story and I wonder if they changed parts of the original book.  Watch it but don't expect it to keep you on the edge of your seat.

I had a hard time rating it, Graveyard Shift would have probably only gotten 3 stars, Silver Bullet had the childish fear factor.  I went ahead and gave it 4 stars.  Maybe in another 30 years I can attempt Silver Bullet again!",1443225600,,778,4.238095238095238

The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!
