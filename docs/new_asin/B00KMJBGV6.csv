6433773,2,B00KMJBGV6,"Honestly, I couldn't get through the whole thing.  I watched more than half and had to pull the plug.  On the good side, Jeff Bridges does a fine acting job.  However, the story moves slowly and ploddingly along;  a good example of which is the first 22 minutes which consists solely of a completely unnecessary string of scenes in which Bill kills people in gun fights listed with places and dates.  When he gets to Deadwood, I thought, OK, they're going to settle into a story.  But they don't.  There are no relationships built.  Bill mostly sticks to himself, ruminates, smokes opium and has flashbacks.  It's boring.  Not only that, but they are really playing fast and loose with what known facts there are.  They didn't even bother to get Dave Tutt's death scene right.  Personally, I'd recommend watching ""Deadwood"".  It's a lot more entertaining and they stick more closely to the known facts about Wild Bill's murder.",1531267200,,927,4.791139240506329

6433776,5,B00KMJBGV6,"I really like Westerns, especially those featuring the ""Biggie's"", Wild Bill, Buffalo Bill, Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp...  Jeff Bridges truly gets a grip on playing Bill.  (If you don't believe it, watch RIPD.  He's perfect there.)

David Arquette is wonderful as the snivelling Jack McCoy.  There are certain people who can pull that off.  Arquette is gifted to be able to show that type of character.

As supporting actors, Keith Carradine, Bruce Dern and Christina Applegate steer this movie sublimely to a great conclusion.",1529366400,,525,5.178571428571429

6433830,2,B00KMJBGV6,"Wow what a stinker! I made it 1 hour before giving up to come write this review. It is told in a series of short vignettes with a loose narration over the top of it all. It doesn't make any sense or put forth any kind of story arc. Just scene after scene with no correlation. The dialogue seems to have been written by a team of 10-12 year old boys who wanted to make a western. The actors are all wasted in their roles, not even Bridges seems to believe what he has gotten himself into. John Hurt is the Narrator and best pal while Ellen Barkin is the love interest. Both seem to be phoning it in.
Pros: The costuming, sets and props all look fantastic.

The guy in silly hats who played Bill Hickock, I knew I'd seen this actor before - Then it dawned on me, he's the guy who played the druggie in another movie, can't think of the name of it but I remember it had the song 'what condition my condition is in'.  Big Lewboski, that's it.  Anyway, his acting is about as good here as it was in that one.  Most annoying character in this one is 'Calamity Jane'.  This is the kind of person who would keep one moving from town to town.  The kid who came to shoot him, he's in other movies too.  I can't keep up.

After that I just gave up and turned it off. If you're going to make a movie with historical characters I you have to at least make to storyline a little factual. Other than geographical locations and some names this film is simply pure hogwash. I watched the series Deadwood and the dramatic license it took, mixing characters who were not in the same at the same time etc... wasn't distracting. But this... thing... this movie went way beyond a little dramatic license.

Plus even if they'd taken this plot and used unknown characters it still would have failed in my opinion. The camera angles, over use of flash backs, the dialogue. It all just fell flat. Poorly done, very poorly done. What a waste of great talent.",1486857600,3,860,4.548387096774194

I wasn't  sure Bridges would make the role go,  but he has apparently developed the True Grit for this sort of actng.  Walterr Hill hasn't made many stinkers,  that's for sure.  It was nice to see almost everyone correctly armed with the Colt Navy,  or in some case the slightly shorter Dragoon...the actors really had to bustle in order to roll the old smokewagon up clear o' leather,  especially when most pistols in ""Wild Bill""  looked to have been worn too high on the body,  in anticipation of the way that the later Peacemaker would have been packed by the majority of men who shot the Wild West to a close twenty years down the road .

McCall shot Hickock over revenge for Hickock having killed his father - nothing to do with his mother. I actually think this was a good and entertaining movie.

One star off for a scene where Wild Bill fires 30 shots in a row from two six-shooters, with no reloading.

If you want to see a much more compelling fictionalization of Deadwood, watch the HBO series ""Deadwood"" on Prime.  Coincidentally, Keith Carradine, who plays Bill Cody in this film plays Wild Bill Hickock in Deadwood.  The only two knocks I have on Deadwood are that the actress who plays Calamity Jane in that series is even worse than Ellen Burstyn, and the series got dropped by HBO before the story ended (there are rumors of a movie to finish it up however).",1531353600,,751,4.659090909090909
