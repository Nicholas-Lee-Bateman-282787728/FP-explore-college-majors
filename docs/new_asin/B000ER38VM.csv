8113561,3,B000ER38VM,"Contrary to the cover slip, this budget brand region 2 DVD version is in fact only 124 minutes - not 154 minutes. The sound throughout is really quite painfully distorted, occasionally unbearable - and there's simply no need for that. I've hired a VHS version which sounds just fine, however the VHS tape's video is noticeably inferior to this DVD. The VHS is 127 minutes, and I have a tape of a televised version from the eighties which was approximately 137 minutes. So it's not just a choice of watching either a DVD with crappy audio or a VHS with crappy video - I know that these versions are compromised edits.

This FIVE STAR film is worth owning in the best possible edition - with all 154 minutes intact and with high quality in both video and audio. Those with the money to burn shouldn't even consider buying this cheapie DVD, they should go direct to the Criterion edition.",1172448000,,885,4.566037735849057
