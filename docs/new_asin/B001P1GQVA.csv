8404674,4,B001P1GQVA,"I would have given this dvd five stars based on the musicianship however, the production is a little rough compared to the high def dvds available now so that's the only reason I gave it four. These two guys put on a clinic in how to play chamber music. All the minute musical details of dynamics and phrasing have been carefully worked out, the cues are so subtle but spot on, and the playing is some of the cleanest you'll have a chance to hear. Whether you're just a music lover looking for a good concert to put on, or you're looking for some inspiration to fire up your own practice sessions. This is a good place to start. This dvd is easily one of my favorites among the Mel Bay releases.  The program is varied and interesting and contains some very demanding works, including Suite Retratos, by Gnattalli, Tonadilla, by Rodrigo, and Tango Suite by Piazzolla, which is a raw display of exactly what these two can do. There are some lesser known works which are also great to hear along side the warhorses they play. Highly recommended.",1352764800,,1043,4.518518518518518
