I did not look close enough. Fool me once shame on you.

I know he is a new director, but Cody did a great job of telling the story of his road to overcoming the loss of his father through running.  With how few people have the funds, or tenacity to make a film in this niche genre, I was proud of what Cody did with this film.  I feel that though films of this genre do not have the budget or glamor of big Hollywood genres, as athletes we need to support films that document our niche, so we can continue to enjoy this type of inspiration. Thanks Cody!
