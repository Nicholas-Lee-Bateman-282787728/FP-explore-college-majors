8607611,3,B00EOUQM2W,"""Private Number"" is a good example of the effect of the introduction of censorship in 1934 in Hollywood. A remake of the film ""Common Clay"", a film hit of 1930, all the sting (and logic) of the original has been sanitised into a melodrama about a servant girl who secretly falls in love and marries the son the of the household in which she works, falls pregnant (no-one knows she is married) and is banished from the house in disrepute. In the original, she was unmarried. The resultant court case tries to anul the marriage. Starring the wide eyed Loretta Young and Robert Taylor, the film starts well but deteriorates into a series of improbable plot developments, all totally unconvincing. The stars perform competently but with no great depth. The production values however, are first rate and the supporting cast, including slimy Basil Rathbone and amusing Patsy Kelly, are invaluable.

This is a Fox Archives product which means there are no extras or even a scene selection.  The print is adequate.",1443484800,,1006,4.87719298245614
8607612,5,B00EOUQM2W,"When this film was released in June of 1936, Robert Taylor went to New York to promote it and was mobbed by his female fans everywhere he went.  It ended up being the favorite film that summer for teenage girls. But in spite of its appeal to teenagers, it has a lot to entertain adults also. ( For almost 80 years the world has not understood the choice of the title for this film as it has nothing to do with the storyline.) Taylor is quite good in this film but the three that really make the picture work are Loretta Young, Basil Rathbone and Patsy Kelly. Kelly keeps the humor going all through the film and absolutely sparkles. Rathbone does not disappoint in his trademark villain persona. He is creepy, unlikable, and almost a stalker and that is just the type of role he always handled brilliantly. However, the one who impresses me the most is Loretta Young. She carries the entire picture with her classic flair as a house maid who gets married secretly and handles being pregnant with dignity and determination. She is confident of who she is and does not allow anyone to mistreat her.  The chemistry in this film between Young and Taylor is so real and they are both so beautiful that one wishes with a touch of genuine sadness that they had made more films together than just this one. When they first meet in the film they immediately dance and it is the best moment of the movie!",1436486400,2,1394,4.44140625

8607615,5,B00EOUQM2W,"Bought it as a Basil fan,and he did not disappoint. Handsome Bob Taylor meets,marries and is stupid enough to doubt his ladylove until the bitter end,all because Baz the butler is jealous and vindictive. Love the hit he takes to the chin and flying backward over the desk.",1403654400,,272,4.6875
8607616,4,B00EOUQM2W,I liked this. It's a good chic flick for it's time. Just looking at Robert Taylor is pure pleasure. Loretta Young has always been a favorite of mine .,1397692800,,150,4.206896551724138
8607617,4,B00EOUQM2W,"""Common Clay,"" a play by Cleves Kincaid, opened in August of 1915 on
Broadway. It was relatively successful and ran for 316 performances. In
1919 a silent film of the stage play was released starring Fannie Ward
as Ellen and W. E. Lawrence as Hugh. ""Common Clay"" was filmed again as
a talkie in 1930, starring Constance Bennett and Lew Ayres. Both films
were well reviewed with the New York Times commenting on the 1919 film
as ""the amazing adventures of 'that common clay girl' are still
amazing, and Miss Ward and her company first wring and then cheer the
hearts of their spectators."" (March 3, 1919).

The 1930 version of the film was pre-code and had a number of racy
elements. The 1936 version, retitled ""Private Number,"" was cleaned up,
slimmed down and simplified. Some of the character names were changed.
(The new title is a complete mystery since telephones don't enter into
the story at all.) Although Robert Taylor received top billing, the
film actually belongs to Loretta Young. Ms. Young portrays a young
girl, down on her luck and penniless who becomes a maid for a wealthy
family. Basil Rathbone is delightfully slimy as the lecherous and
crooked butler for whom Ms. Young works.

Of course, Ms. Young (Ellen) and Mr. Taylor (Dick, the Winfield's son)
fall in love. The progress of their romance at the family's summer
house in Maine is photographed beautifully. Ms. Young looks gorgeous in
a bathing suit, a long gown and her maid's outfit. Mr. Taylor, wearing
far too much makeup as he did in those days, is nonetheless affecting
as the love-struck college boy. Both stars combine physical beauty with
polished performances. Patsy Kelly is always good and she is very good
here as Ms. Young's fellow maid and friend. Marjorie Gateson and Paul
Harvey are stuffy but sympathetic as Mr. and Mrs. Winfield, Dick's
parents. Prince, a Great Dane, is excellent as Hamlet, a Great Dane.

In the earlier versions, Hugh, now Dick, loves Ellen and leaves her
high and dry (and pregnant) when he goes back to college. In Private
Number they marry and she makes him go back to finish his degree.
Although the acting continues to be first rate, as is the direction and
cinematography, the script creaks along from one implausibility to
another. Probably the worst one is when Ellen is thrown out of the
Winfield's home and fetches up immediately in a lovely farmhouse that
someone (never specified) has lent her.

It all comes to a climax in a totally unbelievable but nonetheless
absorbing trial where evildoers are unmasked and justice triumphs. At
the end of the film Ms. Young forgives Mr. Taylor for not trusting her
and they go into a final clinch.

Private Number shouldn't be a good movie but it is. The creaky script
is more than made up for by the direction by Roy del Ruth, the
extraordinary visuals and the thoroughly professional acting.",1388707200,5,2856,4.78498985801217
