3546001,5,B001E65A8G,"The 20 minute stretch segments in this video are great to supplement the often too short cool-down/stretches at the end of other exercise videos or after a home workout with weights or on a treadmill.  It is nice to have the option to use different equipment depending on your mood.  My favorite section is the stretch with the exercise ball.  It is really the perfect tool to use with the stretches, and after workouts my body actually craves this stretch segment!  This is more of a video to use after a workout (when your body is warmed up) than one just to practice stretching.  Many of the moves are yoga-based.  When I want to stretch for relaxation, I use the video Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee.  I would recommend that video highly especially for beginners.",1357516800,,777,4.669117647058823
3546002,5,B001E65A8G,"What can I say other than the heading?  Love anything Cathe!  I only do the more serious weight lifting videos, have found that lifting weights is the only thing that tightens my skin along with the muscle and I am so active I don't need cardio workouts.  This stretch video is just enough to make me actually stretch and love doing it.  It does it without being Yoga like.  I hate Yoga.  I need action. I have even tried Yoga on the beach, still no go.

I will break out this video if life is stressing me and cant get to the water and it calms me right down.... Thank you Cathe!!",1339632000,,581,4.133928571428571
3546003,5,B001E65A8G,"this is a wonderful collection of stretching routines
Used to follow this show on FIT TV and don't have that channel any longer",1339545600,,127,4.565217391304348
3546004,5,B001E65A8G,"I tend to skip stretching after my workouts, especially if I'm short on time. I know that when I do make time for stretching, my athletic performance improves dramatically. I do a lot of intense cardio and heavy weight training and tend to get sore. If I do stretching regularly, I'm not as sore.

I enjoy the routines on this DVD so much that I actually look forward to stretching.

This DVD has 3 20 minute stretching routines. Routine 1 uses no equipment. Routine 2 uses a stability ball and Routine 3 uses a band.

What I especially enjoy about this DVD:

**the variety. With 3 separate routines to choose from, I don't get bored.

**how each routine works my muscles slightly differently. I especially enjoy stretching with the stability ball, since I don't have any other workouts that use the stability ball in this way.

*the relaxing music. It really fits in with the stretching.

**the background crew. All of Cathe's regulars are in this DVD: Cedie, Rhonda, Brenda, Jai and Lorraine. Since I've seen them in so many of Cathe's workouts, I feel like they are old friends.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting to incorporate more stretching into their workout programs. It is suitable for all levels from beginner to advanced.",1284508800,20,1246,4.736111111111111
3546005,5,B001E65A8G,"I'm almost 40 and have never been as flexible as I am after one month of using this DVD.  It has helped my golf game and made me feel like a whole new person.  I actually can't wait every morning to wake up and start my day with about 25 minutes of stretching.  In fact, many days I do the routine twice!  The time goes fast and you feel so good and are completely relaxed that before you know it you've done 25 minutes of stretching and feel great.",1249776000,12,449,4.01123595505618
3546006,5,B001E65A8G,"I've done this stretch routine for about 4 years off an old tv copy, so I was happy to find one here. This isn't a long or hardcore workout, it's what it says, stretching. I use it after I workout and on days that I just feel a bit stiff.  I suggest the first few times you use it don't be afraid to stop and watch portions for timing and or keep your sound up; there are a couple of places that you don't hear a movement change (ex. downward log with a leg lift). Give yourself time to learn it and let your body adjust to the movements. I thought it was a little lame when I first saw it, it's a little retro in the look and the music, but I found that I started to enjoy the chill from the music and it helps relax me. When I started using it I was working out about three hours a day and needed a good stretch, the more I did it, the better I felt. I have it on my iTunes for travel and even if I don't workout, I'll stretch. Cathe is awesome, her workouts are great, glad I found this.",1415318400,2,990,3.8529411764705883
3546007,2,B001E65A8G,"Meh!  I was disappointed.  I purchased the top 5 rated stretching DVD's on Amazon and found this one subpar. I have not found a stretching DVD that matches the quality of ""Lastics""  In fact, I wish I only purchased ""Lastics"" and saved my money, it was by far the best of the 5 that I bought and tried.  I found that ""Stretch Max"" moves too quickly and does not offer enough instruction.  For example, when I move into a pose, I would like to know what muscle is suppose to be stretched and any tips to increase the stretch or improve the technique.  This DVD offers virtually nothing in the area of correct technique.  In a few of the poses, I did not feel a stretch at all and had no idea why, I was left wondering exactly what muscle was she was trying to reach and was offered no guidance.  At times I found the verbal cues difficult to hear.  At the end of the DVD, I still felt tightness in my neck/shoulders and lower legs.  Save your money and just purchase ""Lastics.""",1410566400,6,975,4.25
3546008,4,B001E65A8G,"Loved watching Cathe for years via FitTV and now, several years later, I still find her workouts great for toning. This stretching video is perfect for those ""days off"" from working out. Love it and it comes highly recommended!",1405382400,,227,4.846153846153846
3546009,3,B001E65A8G,"I agree with one reviewer about the stretches not being held long enough, so that a person can gain flexibility.  According to the some yoga books the stretches should be held at least 30 seconds to a one minute.  If you are as inflexible as I am we need to hold those stretches.  I think Rodney Yee is a good yoga instructor, that has gives a person a variety of yoga stretches and he has books and DVD""s on his yoga instructions.",1402876800,,431,4.2317073170731705
3546010,4,B001E65A8G,This is an excellent and thorough stretch workout. I use it often. Although I thought the price was a bit steep. I would recommend it.,1394409600,,134,4.4
3546011,5,B001E65A8G,I really like having 3 stretch routines within one DVD.  I have noticed increased flexibility since doing the DVD. I like the pace and I'm not bored!,1392336000,,149,4.518518518518518
3546012,4,B001E65A8G,"This is a good video. I didn't give it five stars because they didn't hold the poses long enough. I really felt like she was trying to get through it as fast as possible and get  on to something else. Over all, if you're looking for a good stretch, I'd say you'll get that.",1382832000,4,273,4.055555555555555
3546013,4,B001E65A8G,I needed a video that would stretch my entire body. This is really good & I feel great after completing all the stretches,1381190400,,121,4.304347826086956
3546014,3,B001E65A8G,"This series of stretches is good for the beginner, but for me I wish it had been a little more intense.  I prefer Madeleine Lewis AM/PM stretches and/or Karen Voight Full Body Stretch",1366848000,5,183,4.545454545454546
8296589,2,B001E65A8G,"I like the stretching exercises, however the audio on the DVD comes and goes throughout the session. I was informed by Amazon that the DVD was non returnable.",1522195200,,158,4.678571428571429
8296590,5,B001E65A8G,I love this DVD. 22 minutes..gentle full body stretch. I always feel better after I do it!,1519084800,,90,4.352941176470588
8296591,5,B001E65A8G,"I own a couple of Cathe DVD's - would like to own more but I'm specifically looking for Stretching & Yoga and she doesn't have that many to offer. This tape offers a really great sampling of how dynamic stretching can really be, featuring segments where you are equipment free, using a stability ball and finally using resistance bands.

First the downside:
In my opinion she has way too many people demonstrating behind her and usually if you have that many folks doing the workout they are demonstrating modifications to the workout. That is not the case here and I found it a little annoying to have to visually ignore all those ladies in the background and just concentrate on Cathe.
It's not worth getting this tape if you don't own all of the equipment necessary to do all the segments.

Now the Upside:
You will get a nice workout from this tape. Runs over an hour long if you do all 3 segments and I would highly recommend that you do because use of the different equipment ends up working different muscles in your body. If you are a beginner don't start here - try her regular Stretch DVD first and work up to this one which is exactly what I did.",1463097600,,1157,4.427230046948357
8296592,5,B001E65A8G,This is the best stretching video I have found.  Especially the stability ball section!,1456790400,,87,5.214285714285714
8296593,4,B001E65A8G,"Good for stretching out after a workout, or just doing on its own a few times a week.  There are three different stretching routines, one with no equipment, one with a band, and one with a ball.  I enjoy them all, but the one with no equipment is what I usually do for a quick and relaxing stretch.  Cathe Friedrichs workouts are a little pricy, but to me are worth it.",1456185600,,369,4.169014084507042
8296594,5,B001E65A8G,"My favorite stretch tape final it bit the dust, and I needed to replace it. Cathe is amazing.  I believe anyone who buys this will enjoy the routines.",1439942400,,150,4.357142857142857
8296595,3,B001E65A8G,I enjoy the workouts very much. The three workouts add a good variety. Unfortunately with two DVDs the ball workout does not run.,1436313600,,129,4.6521739130434785
8296596,3,B001E65A8G,Since I LOVED the first Cathe Friedrich stretch dvd workout I thought I'd like this as well. It's good but not as good as her other one. I should explain that its probably because the stretch workouts in this dvd are longer than the first one. There are 3 and each is about 20 mins long. The first dvd also has 3 workouts but they are 12-15 mins long which appeals to me more.,1426032000,2,376,4.094594594594595
8296597,5,B001E65A8G,I bought it for the 20 minute ball stretch. I've used it before and I love it. I do the 20 minute stretch after aroebic exercise.,1424217600,,129,4.0
8296598,2,B001E65A8G,"I originally bought this DVD hoping to find some different, and possibly more involved, stretch routines that I could do on a Saturday/Sunday after a week of regular exercise. Given the caliber of other Cathe videos, I figured this would fit the bill. I was wrong.

The routines are short (20 minutes), which is nice. Each routine has about one stretch that I really enjoyed, but the other 19 minutes of the video felt like a waste.

There are no stretches that feel intense, or even very effective, for that matter, if you are an experienced exerciser with some flexibility. The stability ball routine was kind of a joke. I didn't feel that it was a useful prop, and actually hindered my getting a good stretch from the lunges. It was the most irritating of all of the stretch videos.

Overall, I think this video would be great for a beginner exerciser, or someone with absolutely no flexibility. If you don't fit into either of those categories, I don't think you'll like this video. I realize that the title is ""Stretch Max,"" but there is nothing ""Max"" about these stretches. An overpriced disappointment.",1419811200,,1109,4.7357512953367875
