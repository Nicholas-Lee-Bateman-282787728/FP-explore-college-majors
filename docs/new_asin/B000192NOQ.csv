8008120,2,B000192NOQ,"The MTI video is 1.85:1 WITHIN a 4:3 frame so you're stuck with a stretched screen or 4 black bars on all four sides. No subtitles.

The video transfer is OK as is the audio. Shame about the aspect ratio. Guess it was produced when most homes still had 4:3 analogues.",1403913600,,267,4.235294117647059
8008121,4,B000192NOQ,"Given that there are only a couple real stars in this flick, I was entranced from beginning to
end.  The film making and music were top notch, even if the acting was uneven.  The meaningful
storyline against racism, prejudice and crime were more than enough to overcome any minor flaws.",1251763200,2,286,4.7
8008122,5,B000192NOQ,I showed this movie to a group of inmates at our local correctional facility and it passed that test!. They know when the storyline and the characters are convincing. I would recommend this movie highly. I love true stories and the ending of this movie is extremely moving. Excellent performances by all the actors involved.,1117670400,9,324,4.909090909090909
8008123,4,B000192NOQ,"This was a watered-down ""Oz"" mixed with ""Remember the Titans.""  The last federal prison is desegregating in Georgia and so the white and black protagonists have to learn how to get along.  Along the way, they coach each other about family members and women.  This is just one of countless films where white men and black men learn to cooperate and like each other through sports. This movie has no nudity and does not mention any sex between prisoners.  The film is full of the white character making all these corny but hilarious, ""Guess what I did with your wife last night?"" jokes.  The funniest thing about this movie, which is supposed to take place in the late 60s or early 70s, was that every person with an Afro obviously just went to the five-and-dime wig shop and bought the phoniest Afro they could find.  I enjoy prison flicks, that's why I liked this.  If you like your prison flicks to have grit and be edgy, you'll be let down by this film.",1099267200,7,955,4.485549132947977
