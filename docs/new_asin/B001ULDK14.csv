I wish I had gotten this while he was still with me. He could not have known he was in it or that this was ever completed.

8469140,5,B001ULDK14,My great aunt is a part of this documentary.  My great aunt was an amazing woman.  Never have I enjoyed an emotional roller coaster quite like I did while I was watched this documentary.  This dvd is not only a wonderful way to honor the brave men and woman that served in the 77th evacuation unit but also to tell their story...one that I wish I would have asked my aunt about more while she was still alive.,1331769600,,409,4.217948717948718
