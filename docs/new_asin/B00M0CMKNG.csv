8669284,4,B00M0CMKNG,"One very notable wrongful teaching in this dvd is when Weiss teaches that a man's wife is AT ALL/whatsoever responsible for ANY of his staying away from sexual temptation/impurity. No, his staying sexually pure, and thus faithful to his marriage, is 100% HIS burden and responsibility to bear (a biblical teaching - 'each one is to know how to possess their own body in sanctification and honor'), along with his seeking God's assistance as well as that of his accountability partners. A wife is never her husband's ""mother"" i.e. helping him in not being 'naughty' sexually. He is completely responsible to fully be an adult, who maintains his marital sexual faithfulness withOUT her help whatsoever. He then continually presents to his wife his ongoing sexual purity. But, otherwise, the dvd and accompanying book and workbook provide very helpful info.",1525046400,,854,5.151079136690647

8669286,5,B00M0CMKNG,"Dr. Doug has written many books and prepared several video's for the Sexually Addictied family, but this one I believe is his best, he presents great material for the person who want to live a life of Integrity and Purity. I have led Sexual Addiction groups for over 15 years and I used this material regularly and require my men to read the book. Thank Dr. Doug for your continued fight in the war against our family structure.",1463097600,3,428,4.5
