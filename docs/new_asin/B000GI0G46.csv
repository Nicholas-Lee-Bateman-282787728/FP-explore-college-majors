8132316,5,B000GI0G46,"For those who are familiar with the first Weatherwoman film, please note that ""The Weatherwoman Returns"" is not really a sequel, rather it is a 'stand alone' film which is a variation on a theme. Kei Mizutani played the weatherwoman in the first film and she was definitely a rough diamond and really dominated the film and the other characters! Misa Aika plays Keiko, the weatherwoman, in this newer film and she is all sweetness and light in comparison to Ms Mizutani's dominatrix.

Okay, there are lots of knickers and bum/fart jokes, so don't expect ""High Art"", but the whole thing is quite outrageous and a lot of fun. Yes, some people may accuse this film, and the other Weatherwoman film, for that matter, of simply being soft porn, and to some extent, they would be right - although I can't think of anyone getting much of that sort of titillation from this film.

However, if you feel like watching an escapist film which is knowingly silly and doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, then you may enjoy this film, and yes, the women in the cast are gorgeous, if you want to know!

A ridiculous film? Hell yeah!",1192147200,2,1124,4.61
