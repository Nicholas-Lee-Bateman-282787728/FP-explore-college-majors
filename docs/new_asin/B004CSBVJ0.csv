4328742,5,B004CSBVJ0,"I recently got to watch an advance showing of ""White Lion"" and can only say that if you aren't already an animal lover, this film should make one of you! My first comment after watching the film was that it was as good as any comparable Disney flick I've ever seen (and that says a LOT!)

I recommend the ""White Lion"" for everyone!",1294185600,43,331,4.253968253968254
4328743,5,B004CSBVJ0,"This story is about a young White Lion cub named Letsatsi.  Letsatsi is destined to be revered by the Shangaan.

A white lion cub must beat the odds to become an adult. According to legend, white lions are the messengers of the gods, but Letsatsi's uniqueness just makes him vulnerable.

He is cast out from the pride and, close to starvation, befriended by Nkulu. The older lion helps him survive but is killed by a farmer, leaving Letsatsi to survive on his own.

He learns to hunt and grows into a formidable adult. But before he can take over a pride of his own, Letsatsi must face his greatest foe - the trophy hunter, for whom legends are worthless and rare skins priceless.

This is a Real-Life LION KING MOVIE!!  It is for anyone who also loved the movie about two tiger cubs in ""Two Brothers.""

I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD and I am glad that it finally did!!  I plan to purchase this amazing DVD about Letsatsi's Journey Home and recommend it to anyone who loves animals, particularly lions.

This movie is one of the greatest achievements in Film since the movie ""Born Free"" about a lioness named Elsa.",1293753600,88,1138,4.458937198067633

4328798,5,B004CSBVJ0,"Although I think tawny lions are magnificent, white lions are an especially gorgeous animal. I enjoyed watching the life and hard times of this little white cub and how he grew into such a beautiful lion. I did enjoy the documentary style of the movie, although not what style I had anticipated. I was sad to read at the end that of the 300,000 lions that used to roam Africa, only 23, 000 remain. Shame on humans for destroying a major portion of the world for our own greed and in the process, destroying so many beautiful creatures that were possibly around first.",1474934400,3,567,4.514563106796117

4328839,5,B004CSBVJ0,I've always liked animal movies without the animals dubbing in their voices but this one goes to the head of its genre. You figure out the interplay even when humans got involved & still see the white lion's point of view. You really sympathize with him & feel his strength & accomplishment vs incredible odds.

4329033,5,B004CSBVJ0,"I'm amazed with the action of the lions and how the trainers got them to act this way.  The narration is not overly frequent, which is good.  The story is fairly predictable, but not so if you're a kid.  The target audience is 6-10, which is made apparent from the child audience casted in front of the story.  If you're worried about your children being influenced by the OCD drama and sarcasm built into today's animated movies, you'll love this movie.  It's suspenseful, yet calming.  Yes, there is some blood from a few lion hunts.  But, it is minor, and nothing a 5-8 year can't handle (unless they're oppressed, which is a worse in my opinion).  A+ for the kids.",1418515200,,668,4.508333333333334

I now own this movie and I am not sure that I will ever watch it again, not because it's terrible, but because it's a one time kind of movie.

The lions don't talk, there's no corny animation but plenty of family-friendly drama and a lot of trust between the actors and the wranglers who got them through the scenes. Share it with your family or school group and spark a conversation about lions and conservation. The lion actors are gorgeous, the bush scenery is a lush feast for the eyes. It won major awards in South Africa and deserves more attention from the US!

The back-story about Kevin Richardson, the wrangler who got the lion actors to perform, is quite amazing, do a little research and you will get a glimpse of what it actually took to bring the fable to life using real lions and hyenas.

This is unusual because of difficulties  in filming and most African movies are filmed in the winter. Recall that in most African movies the background is brown, not green. I purchases this movie for that reason. My familiarity with how much of it was filmed made it particularly interesting to me. It is incredibly beautiful. On the other hand the story line is a bit simplistic and the acting will win no awards. Hence the four rating. I recommend the movie for anyone with an interest in Africa.",1353196800,,661,4.508333333333334

It does not work.
I was informed it was not the same system as we have in Europe and consider there should have been a word of warning that it can only be used in the US.
So this was a big waste and very annoying and does not feel honest at al!!!
I want to return product, but do not know where to send it to, please inform me of the correct procedure.
However I would love to have the film in a version we can view in Europe in exchange or else if not possible be reimbursed.",1341360000,,893,5.7218045112781954
4329100,5,B004CSBVJ0,I received this movie for Easter 2010 because I love lions.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes lions.  This is an interesting movie and is perfect for anyone who loves animals.,1335830400,,185,4.575757575757576

4329102,5,B004CSBVJ0,"I really liked this movie.  It's unlike any other-Though much of the film is like a documentary of lions, a narrator who we see at intervals (telling children the story of the white lion around a bonfire) draws it all together in the story of the life of the main white lion cub. Moves a bit slow (as real life often does) but is relaxing in that way.

Beautiful scenery, real lions etc. not computer generated-made for an awesome film--the cubs are so cute and the big lions stunning. (how they got these lions to act is beyond me).

Demonstrates the importance of all God's creatures and how we humans are just another part of the circle of life.  Great audio really rounds it out.  Like a documentary but better.  (although without all the factual material)

You won't see any concrete here.",1332288000,,794,4.549295774647887

I will watch it many times and recommend it to anyone who is interested in big cats and the African bush. I am not sure why this movie did not do well when it was released.

4329109,4,B004CSBVJ0,"A very good film about a white lion. Very intense and educational as well. The white lion in the film was real and not CG which was also cool. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of two reasons. One, the narater has such a strong Afracan accent that I can't understand a word he says without putting the DVD subtitles on. Two, they could have added a little bit more of a plot. It was kinda the same as watching Animal Planet Big cat diarys. Other wise, it is a great film.",1315440000,,501,4.070707070707071

There's some amazing footage of lions, particularly the rare white lion who is the star of the movie. Most of the ""story"" is simply narrated over the footage. I think it works quite well. However, it can get a bit slow as the lion looks for food. Basically, if you like watching wildlife documentaries, this will probably work.

4329112,5,B004CSBVJ0,"This was an excellent production! I was looking to purchase Disney's African Cats which I watched back in April in theatres when I stumbled on this one. A heart warming story which was creatively presented. It will definitely complement African Cats when I finally receive it in October. I'm so glad I made the purchase and I know that I will be enjoying this movie for years to come with my family! The writers and producers of the movie, I feel, really accomplished their goal of raising awareness to our need to preserve wildlife. I am completely sold and hope that more people can see this and stop the senseless poaching of our animals.",1312416000,,641,4.631578947368421
4329113,5,B004CSBVJ0,"This is a great film and a wonderful story, in the making, in the telling, and in the seeing.  Filming real cats (who could easily have us for lunch, even with their handlers around) while coaxing them to ""perform"" in front of a camera crew was not an insignificant accomplishment. Talking about herding cats, the blu-ray ""extra"" featurete on the making of the film tells that part of the story.

Along the lines of Winged Migration, or March of the Penguins, the main characters are the animals (real cats from the lion preserve in South Africa).  The visuals are stunning, the cinematography is amazing and the musical score is quite a treat.  This movie has become an immediate big hit with my children, though much like Winged Migration it was never intended to be a children movie.  You can see how the jungle is not a place suitable for human habitation.  Predators prowling at night looking for food will not hesitate to kill any number of two or four-legged creatures they find... with all the unfortunate consequences associated with such encounters...

I'd much rather the school districts pick this one up and show it to our second and third graders.  It will be quite an education.  The moms and dads should see it too.  It is an invaluable journey and experience for city-folk like me.",1306281600,7,1298,4.728888888888889

4329116,5,B004CSBVJ0,"I ordered this from Amazon after reading a very favorable review at Blu-ray.com. I can honestly say they were right. This is a wonderful movie and a really beautiful blu-ray transfer. The story itself, of the young lion's often perilious journey from cub to adulthood, is well-told, well-paced, and well...""acted"" by the animals (and the handful of humans involved). The cinematography is gorgeous---as good as any African footage I've seen in HD---and the transfer to blu-ray shows off the detail perfectly. The audio isn't in-your-face like your typical hollywood action flick and rightly so. It serves the movie exactly as it should, surrounding the listener in a much more natural soundscape while still becoming intense in scenes such as the forest fire.

At Amazon's price this blu-ray is a bargain, and one of those rare little known gems that more people should be aware of. Highly recommended for both adults and children.",1304035200,10,931,5.125
4329117,5,B004CSBVJ0,"I bought ""White Lion"" when I was in a local music shop, because I heard a French couple ask the assistant for a good local (South African) movie.  When the assistant recommended this movie, the couple said they'd already seen it and it was ""excellent!""

Curious, I bought it...and from the moment Letsatsi, as is the nature of lions in the wild, was cast from his pride until he has to face his greatest challenge, I went through every emotion. I laughed at his youthful explorations; cried at his hunger; was so angry at the very real threat trophy hunters pose to all the lions of Africa (lion numbers have been so drastically reduced in recent years, they will shortly be on the endangered species list!) and was constantly in awe at the beauty of these magnificent creatures.

This story, redolent with the mystique of the bush, is a tale of that speaks of myths and legends, of spirits and heroes. Letsatsi's struggles, the dangers he faces from both cruel nature and even crueller mankind, could be the conflict that any person must overcome. But Letsatsi is a white lion, a messenger from the ancestral spirits who guard this land of ours and, although he loses one friend, he finds another, sent by the ancestors. Getsani, a young Shangaan, is called to protect this symbol of hope and helps guard Letsatsi from the terrible dangers he must overcome.

Although there are not many humans--the real stars of this show are the lions--the acting, as one expects of the likes of John Kani, is excellent.  Showing the sweeping vistas of this beautiful country, the photography is breath-taking. In its respect and love for these animals, the well-written script is touchingly sincere and, while avoiding any proselytizing, clearly emphasises the importance of protecting our wild life from senseless slaughter by callous killers.

To say I was proudly South African throughout this film is an understatement, because this movie combines an evening of good family entertainment with an emotional melancholy at what one fears is an endangered and rapidly disappearing natural world.",1303257600,16,2082,4.951289398280802
4329118,5,B004CSBVJ0,"All who are interested in the conservation of the great cats of the wild should be directed to this film.  Photographically, it stands up to anything filmed in Africa.

To an African tribe in South Africa, the white lion is revered...and the disappearance of such an animal spells hardship for the land.  A young African male discovers a young white lion cub - and through his lifetime - acts as a secret protector of this sacred being.

Parts of the story are a coming of age tale of the young cub who gets lost from his mother, finds an older lion friend, and then
is compelled to strike out and hunt on his own. [All the animals in the Disney animated film - The Lion King -  are actually filmed in this story - but the true conflicts between these creatures in the great wild are quite thrilling). Yes, there are several cinematic shots that can only be described as ""hold your breath"" moments.

As explained in the special feature, no one has ""ever"" filmed these lions so intimately before.  The movie took years to make and it is the result of the special bonding of the caretakers in South African parks with the white lions themselves.

Whether you are eight years old or eighty - I highly recommend this gorgeous film... obtain the Blu-Ray if you can.  The emotions it stirs is a respect for the sacredness of all life. Given the choice - I actually preferred this movie to [National Geographic's} ""The Last Lions"" (released in 2011)...but both are extremely impressive cinematic achievements.

And for those interested in human stories of the people of Africa and their relationship to the lion,  I do recommend ""Masai: The Rain Warriors.""",1298678400,41,1649,4.651724137931034

8423564,5,B004CSBVJ0,"My children and I enjoyed this movie. It shows life in the wild and tells a story of a young man out to protect this white lion. If you are wanting a happy ever after story watch a Disney princess movie. Animals in the wild are killed and that is life. However, poachers need to be strapped down and given a good beaten. I do not like killing animals if it is for a trophy; animals are only to be killed if eaten. We do not see people running around trying to kill a great spotted cow because We got the beef. If we kill an animal for food then we have the right to use the skins. Other than that the message is loud and clear. Quit killing animals for selfish reasons. It tells you at the end that there use to be over 300,000 lions, but because of ignorant people the population has gone down to 23,000. Very educational for children of all ages if you can handle watching animals eat each other. The world is not a bed of roses so children should be well educated on the real world. I know too many who will not allow their children to learn about war, but we need to know what is going on in the world. By our children understanding they can grow and help make a difference.",1517702400,,1178,4.103896103896104

Just one of the giveaways was one of the lionesses that were used as the mother, had quite a bit of fatty skin hanging from her chest along her abdomen. It's rare to see that in wild lions, if at all. I would've given 5 stars if they somehow added more about the loss of lions in the wild than just a paragraph or 2 at the end of the movie.

I applaud the tireless and devoted love and work with lions which Kevin Richardson has given us so that this picture could be made and loved by those who get to see it and live with these beautiful creatures..WITHOUT feeling the need to capture them as throphies, but to let them LIVE, as LIONS, as they are, in the Wild...or as protected creatures when the wild is just too dangerous or restricted for them to live freely.",1498348800,4,786,4.702898550724638
