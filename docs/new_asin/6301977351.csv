402811,5,6301977351,"This sequel to the 50th Anniversary compilation from 1974, is a treat. Some critics dissected Gene Kelly on the account he was producing is own memorial service... Morbid indeed... It is a flawless, wonderful compilation. Many studios have tried to copy the excellense of these films, but they don`t have the legacy nor the artistery so if u wanna c revisit history of the Hollywood that was....  check out this compilation-series...",1109980800,9,433,5.098591549295775
402812,3,6301977351,"There are some gems in this 1976 edition of ""That's Entertainment"", but seeing Fred and Gene trying to dance and clown was hard for me to watch. Although they were energetic and supreme in their craft in their heyday, they are obviously trying too hard to be entertaining within the context of introducing the clips. It was heartwarming, but somehow painful to watch them TRYING to be great again. I would have much preferred them to simply introduce the clips in dignified fashion... and surprise... that's exactly what the producers did in ""That's Entertainment part 3"" in 1994. It worked as beautifully as it did in the first edition. Both 1 and 3 also concentrated on MUSICAL numbers, and part 2 does not... it seemed to mock the old musical style more than present it. Having said that, there are some real gems here... so I gave it only 3 stars. Part 1 and 3 are 5 star movies.",1098835200,11,883,4.559748427672956

402814,4,6301977351,"I love show tunes and broadway.  This is a really fun movie.  If u have part 1 or 3, u may get some repeated clips.  Astaire and Kelly host this and even though it is sometimes chessy, its fun",1059868800,,192,3.871794871794872
402815,4,6301977351,"Are we really supposed to believe that Fred Astaire had MORE hair when he was 80 than when he was 20? Apart from that it shows how talented Fred and Gene were even though they were collecting their pension!
Much of the dialogue given to the pair is VERY corny but their annecdotes are very sweet [the one about Judy Garland singing Have urself a merry little xmas for example]
It does drag on a bit sometimes notably the non-musical bits but the affection in their voices shows what they think or don't think of certain stars.
I really liked the singing the credits and opening sequence is amazing.",1026604800,,598,4.495412844036697
402816,3,6301977351,"Like its predecessor, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT II offers two hours of film clips from memorable MGM movies featuring the likes of Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, and Doris Day.  Unlike its predecessor, which organized the film clips into thematic sequences introduced by different MGM stars, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT just throws the clips out willynilly without much rhyme or reason--and saddles narrators Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly with some of the clunkiest, corniest material imaginable.  In consequence, it lacks the cohesion and the excitement of the original.

But it still has its charms.  Many of the individual clips are knock-outs: Ethel Waters performing ""Taking a Chance on Love"" from CABIN IN THE SKY, Bobby Van doing the famous ""hop dance"" from SMALL TOWN GIRL, Judy Garland belting out ""I Got Rythmn"" from GIRL CRAZY.  In addition to such musical treats, the film also offers a look at the Marx Brothers with the famous ""State Room Scene"" from A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, a sequence of famous lines from famous films (such as Garbo's ""I want to be alone""), and an extended tribute to Spenser Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.  Most viewers will probably feel the film drags due to the uneven way in which the scenes are introduced and edited together, but just about every one will find plenty to enjoy.  Recommended with reservations.

Maybe after years of watching old films this one would make sense, and be fun, but not for now.  I will save it for later.",1389744000,,410,4.1125

Don't know who else it would appeal to but it led to my buying a few new DVDs I hadn't thought of or perhaps had never seen as movies. Also my first detailed info on the scene that led to unbelievable, unconscionable cruelty to black actors. Don't know if that was in this one or one of the others but it was in reference to Lena Horne.",1379289600,,390,3.949367088607595

The final one (#3) was done 18 years later, in 1994. So I didn't actually buy these, I saw them through Netflix distribution. On whole they are terrific DVD's full of memories from the past.

402893,4,6301977351,"Admittedly not in the same league as its illustrious predecessor, ""That's Entertainment, Part II"" (1976) manages to dig up more treasures from the MGM vault. Hosts Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly provide some fancy footwork in the new segments (their effortless rapport makes you wish they collaborated more often). The comedy tributes are a nice touch while the best musical numbers put a smile on your face. Esther Williams' spectacular waterskiing sequence from ""Easy to Love"" is worth the price of admission. Special kudos to Saul Bass' opening titles. The double-sided DVD includes widescreen and full-screen versions plus the original theatrical trailer.",1359849600,,656,5.4411764705882355

402945,4,6301977351,"That's Entertainment, Part 2 is full of incredibly wonderful clips from some of the best musicals, comedies and even some dramas ever to come out of ""The Dream Factory"" at MGM Studios. True, some will say that hosts Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire tried too hard or their style was perhaps over the top, but it was great to see they still had it! The movie's main flaw, again as others have noted, is that the clips from the movies are shorter than they were in ""That's Entertainment"" and they are indeed presented without any real sense of organization, but then again what I watched was so special my eyes were glued to the screen nonetheless.

There are so many wonderful scenes in this film that I scarcely know where to begin when describing the movie to you; and I'm certainly not going to list them all and spoil it all for you! Bobby Van's ""hop dance"" from ""Small Town Girl"" mesmerized me; I don't know where he got the energy to handle an extended scene like that! The ""stateroom scene"" from ""A Night at the Opera"" with The Marx Brothers had me laughing hysterically; Groucho's one liners are brilliant! Of course, we get plenty of Judy and Mickey both together and with others; and Doris Day's ""Ten Cents a Dance"" is a knockout number that couldn't have been done any better. Bing Crosby comes along in a clip from ""Going Hollywood"" and he does a splendid Cole Porter number, ""Now You Has Jazz,"" from ""High Society"" with Louis Armstrong and His Band. We see Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, King and Queen of the operetta; and look for a very young Jack Benny to introduce MGM lyricist and producer Arthur Freed who sings ""The Wedding of the Painted Doll.""

Of course there's much more for you to enjoy including a clip of Greta Garbo dancing; the segment devoted to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn is nicely done.

The DVD has the film in widescreen on one side and the ""standard version"" is on the flip side.

""That's Entertainment, Part 2"" may not be as well organized as its predecessor; but it's every bit as fun and spellbinding to watch. I highly recommend this for fans of the actors here and the golden age of movies from MGM Studios; people who appreciate retrospectives about film from yesteryear in general would also do well to add this to their collections.",1354233600,3,2284,4.577017114914425

402954,4,6301977351,"THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT PART 2 is not quiet the caliber of the first film in the series, but it still has a great deal to offer. Like the first film, it has all sorts of great clips from MGM musicals. For musical lovers makes this film intriguing is that unlike the first film it's not a collection of the best known scenes, but secondary scenes that are treasured by audiences. For example, the Fred Astyaire/Cyd Charisse number in THE BAND WAGON is in the first film but ask anyone who loves this film what one of the best scenes would be, it would bee the ""Triplets"" scene which part two includes. Ann Miller's dancing among the musical instruments in SMALL TOWN GIRL makes the first film but the effervescent scene where Bobby Vann believes he's headed to stardom and hops his way through the town makes part two and if you're a fan of the MGM musical, this stuff is great.

One of the potential drawbacks of this film, at least today, is the Fred Astaire/Gene Kelley narration and dance collaboration. Today it's kind of hokey and distracting, but I'm sure when it was released, their loyal fans probably thought it was great to see them again, and even if it is a bit overdone at times, it's evident how much they loved being song and dance men and how much they did contribute to film in general.

Now if someone from MGM (or Warner Home Video) is reading this, I'd like to make a suggestion. In the overture an excerpt from LILI (""Hi-Lili Hi-Lo"") can be heard. We also become nostalgic for SMALL TOWN GIRL and it makes me wonder whether or not it's time for MGM to look at some of the classics included in all the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT series and do some re-releasing in DVD. I'm sure amny film buffs would appreciate it.",1152835200,2,1725,4.473015873015873
