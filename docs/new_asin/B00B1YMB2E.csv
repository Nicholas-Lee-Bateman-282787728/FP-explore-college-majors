8561156,3,B00B1YMB2E,"It took a while into the viewing to get engaged.  I guess they wanted to establish the fact that he is recognized as a world class artist.  As an artist, I wanted to delve into his process more.",1473552000,,194,4.078947368421052

8561160,4,B00B1YMB2E,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Anatsui's creative process, installation process and grand works!  I didn't realize that he purchased the materials.  I thought they were found.  Still, it is inspiring to see what beauty can be created from the ordinary.  Caveat: The so called ""extras"" at the end aren't -- they are merely repeats of unedited footage. Nevertheless, I am enjoying this video.",1408060800,,387,5.193548387096774
8561161,1,B00B1YMB2E,"El Anatsui is one of the most compelling artists I have had the pleasure to experience in a long while.  I bought this DVD thinking it would be similar to, if not the same as, the DVD shown with his exhibits.  Quite the opposite.  This DVD is dry, boring, tedious and completely misses the opportunity to convey anything of the vibrancy of El Anatsui's work.  I couldn't even finish watching it.

A TOTAL waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.",1391385600,4,443,4.615384615384615
8561162,5,B00B1YMB2E,"I have been following the career of El Anatsui for a few years since I first saw his astonishing tapestry-like works constructed from discarded metal. I have experienced numerous shows at his New York gallery and in academic and museum venues. During his retrospective at Wellesley College, I heard him speak and participate in a discussion about his work. I have read scholarly essays about his art, its antecedents, cultural influences, method of working, etc., but this video is the first time that I have been able to gain insight into what his life at home and in his studio is actually like. It was a revelation to me since I am so much a product of my American cultural conditioning and lifestyle that I think everyone lives the way we do here. Now that I see Nsukka, where he has lived and taught for so many years, I find it overwhelming that his works found their way into the upper echelons of the bigtime art world even though they are so inventive and fabulous . How did it ever happen that such a quiet and self-contained person could make these phenomenal works and present them to the world at large to be admired and collected by every topflight museum and collector? It makes his work and his world-wide acclamation even more amazing. (I say this particularly since I saw an exhibition list at his NY gallery a few years ago and the work was priced in the high six figures and some even at seven. There were several red dots.)

You owe it to yourself to get this video.",1380067200,3,1487,4.507407407407407
8561163,5,B00B1YMB2E,"The celebrated Africanist, Susan Vogel, does a careful, sensitive job exploring the stupendous ""cloth"" hangings by Africa's foremost visual artist, El Anatsui. She surveys his methods of construction of meticulous, creative, and dazzling ""mosaics"" of liquor bottle caps and sleeves, stitched together with copper wire, and shows how a huge relief hanging was installed in the 2007 Venice Biennalle. The video has interviews with the modest yet articulate artist and his colleagues in Nsukka, Nigeria, and with the American critic and curator, Robert Storr.
An important addition to films on African artists.",1369180800,,607,5.608695652173913
8561164,3,B00B1YMB2E,"The art of El Anatsui is revelatory and imposing. The film is monotonous, repetitive, and ends by trivializing the methods and diminishing the monumentality of the artist's vision. It is worth seeing only for the glimpses of El Anatsui's works that someone - like this viewer - might otherwise not have had the opportunity of seeing in person. Subtitles would have helped to strain the often incomprehensible thickness of the spoken comments.",1368144000,6,442,5.152777777777778
