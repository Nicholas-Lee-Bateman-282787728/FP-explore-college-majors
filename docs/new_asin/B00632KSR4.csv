4934471,5,B00632KSR4,"I'm not going to review or rate the movies, that's what IMDB is for.

As far as the product itself: The quality is good. I like it that they take up less space in this format though it does make it harder to organize your DVDs. Even if you don't happen to love all 3 movies it's still a really good price.
The 5 stars is for the product, not the movies. (They would all rate differently, of course.)",1364515200,,399,4.050632911392405
8491693,5,B00632KSR4,Point of No Return is a classic and The Long KISS Goodnight holds its own among female empowerment action movies.  Domino stars Knightly as a real life female bounty hunter but is the worst of the three..,1516492800,,204,4.513513513513513

8491698,2,B00632KSR4,"I bought this set mainly to see Domino.  I haven't finished it yet as I had to take a break from the profanity.  The cast must have taken lessons from a guy I knew who grew up in Queens, New York.  He managed to slip a ""four letter word"" into every sentence if not more often.  My aching ears!",1428451200,,293,3.9152542372881354
8491699,5,B00632KSR4,"This is a great value for Blu-ray of these three movies, all of which are favorites of mine.  I've only recently seen Domino (I hesitated for a very long time) but it was very entertaining and we already decided it was one we could enjoy for repeat viewing.  Long Kiss Goodnight has been a favorite for a long time (and I think my lady probably owned it already, but no matter, nice to have a backup copy).  And Point of No Return, hey I like the original French film (La Femme Nikita) but I really like what they did with it with Bridget Fonda (she's extremely pretty and elegant but she can turn her eyes ice cold in an instant and look absolutely lethal... ""try to imagine what a bullet in the stomach feels like.""), and of course Gabriel Byrne and some other awesome supporting actors are fun to watch.

No worries about the transfer quality - it's wonderful and again very like watching for the first time since the quality is so amazing (Blu-ray brings us closer than ever to the original film).",1427068800,,1001,4.423913043478261
8491700,4,B00632KSR4,"The 4 is for Long Kiss. The others are boring. PNR is a remake of a good French film, practically word-for-word. Domino is silly, whether true or not. Long Kiss is very good.",1418169600,,174,4.303030303030303
8491701,5,B00632KSR4,"I've only watched ""Domino"" so far, but I sampled the other films for sound a video quality. Sound, video of all three BD films was perfect.

Now as to ""Domino,"" I didn't realize it was about a real person. That knowledge up front would have affected how I viewed it. It's got a lot of violence, fast action, and of course, Domino comes out on top, because she really did. There is some supplemental stuff on the disk, including a picture of the real Domino.

It was an excellent action adventure film that I really enjoyed.",1411948800,6,523,4.4375
