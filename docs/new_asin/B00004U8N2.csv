I've conducted some sales meetings much like reggies with the same advice.  My write up form is almost identical to the one in the movie.

Unfortunately it is true...and all the things that happened in the movie are true to form for the business. I wish I could say it wasn't but it is.

1354304,5,B00004U8N2,"being in the car business for the last six years, and being around it for my entire life, i've seen just about every type of car salesman. This movie has nailed every one of them. From the aggressive sales manager, to the sympathetic one, the green pea, to the old car dog. This movie shows the darker side of car sales, it takes the darker side to the extreme.

My friend sells cars and he was laughing at how true  the mentality is! After the movie is concluded, there is a lecture on purchasing a car which may be insightful to buyers. After seeing this, it doesn't make me want to buy a car, though. The movie as a whole is quite entertaining, but quite dark.",1331424000,2,510,4.483870967741935

I love it because i used to be in the car sales buisness, and this is the most realistic depiction of the job as i have seen in a movie.  There are no ""stars"" but the cast all shine through greatly.  You have probably all read about the plot from other reviews so my review isn't going that route.

This review will just let you know that car sales is a dirty game, and you get a glimpse of that game in this movie.  From the opening scene to the last, the cutt throat mentality is showcase briliantly.  I would recommend this movie to whoever loves a good sales movie (Glen Gary Glen Ross or Boiler Room). Aside from the realistic side of the movie, the comedy value is something to mention also.  This movie will have you laughing outloud in every scene. I give Suckers a 4 star rating because of its gritty way of showing you a peek of the carsales business and the cast of characters that play their part so well.",1282521600,2,961,4.190217391304348

1354343,5,B00004U8N2,"I believe a lot of reviewers shortchanging the movie by limiting its merits to the correct depiction of the brutal car business. Yes, it is true. And yes, the acting is great (I actually think that Benzali's performance is out of this world, it might be equaled but not surpassed, check him out on imdb, he is a world-class actor). And yes, the ending is inserted as a dramatic 'finita la comedia', since this movie can go on forever and would be as entertaining as Reggie's creativity during the weekly meetings.
But this movie also poses a very important question (granted, it was asked MANY times before): how the one should live his life. By trying to get away with as much as he can and leave the scorched soil behind or by measuring his action against a moral yardstick. And it does in a very entertaining fashion. As such it serves its purpose to the fullest. As far as the answer to the question - a personal decision of the viewer. 5 stars all the way and my favorite movie of all time. I do realize that it is not 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ' or '12 Angry Men', but I can watch it nonstop from any random spot.

And another point. Do not we all from time to time feel a 'little Reggie' inside us who in much more polite and sugar-coated manner than in the movie is trying to convince us to 'go for it'. But if we strip sugar-coating what will be left is exactly a 'big Reggie' talking. So if you are in doubt about some moral decision in your life - watch the movie again - it might help in solving your dilemma in one way or another",1231459200,4,1549,4.233108108108108

I've been in the car business for 11 years and have seen some outrageous things. Seems when you have younger salesmen making $100k+ a year selling cars, they seem to find their way into trouble fast not knowing what to do with all the money, similar to younger stock brokers or any other sales profession that allows newer salesmen to make large amounts of money. You will usually find these guys after a huge day partying all night, have had a few salesmen over the years call me with their ""one phone call"" as shown In this movie!

There is an overuse of the F word, and a ridiculous ending, but overall a fun film for car guys.
