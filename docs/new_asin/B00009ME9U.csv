1884475,5,B00009ME9U,"Being a great fan of the novel and movie of ""Coming Home,"" I was eager to see what happened next to favorite characters like Judith, Loveday, and Gus. Although Rosamunde Pilcher did not write this sequel herself, for the most part the characters remained true to form.  Only Judith Dunbar, the admirable heroine of ""Coming Home,"" seems to have had a personality downgrade.  As well, a different actress played the part in this sequel and the whole essence of Judith seemed to  change from bright girl marvel to whiney, jealous woman.

""Nancherrow"" begins in February, 1947, with the funeral of Colonel Edgar Carey-Lewis, the patriarch of Nancherrow.  The estate is left to his stubborn and somewhat spoiled daughter Loveday.  She has married beneath her class and cannot convince husband Walter to move to the manor, thus causing endless bickering and sending Walter into the arms of another woman.

One day Loveday sees a magazine ad promoting an art show by her former love Gus Callender.  Never having gotten over Gus, Loveday travels to London and once again takes up with Gus. Thus the stage is set for Loveday's return to Nancherrow with Gus, not Walter.  But it is the overwhelming taxes and cost of keeping up the formerly lavish estate that will threaten her relationship with Gus.  Nancherrow will always be the great love of Loveday's life, and whether there is room in her heart for a man remains in doubt.

Diana remains the beautiful and supportive mother, risking bankruptcy herself to keep Nancherrow for Loveday.  We also see a new dimension to Diana as attractive widow, industrious worker, and clever manipulator.

Will Gus and Diana be able to convince Loveday to sell Nancherrow?  Will Loveday be able to love a person as much as she loves her father's legacy?  Will her son Nat be torn between his well-bred mother and his father, a commoner? Will Judith be able to accept the unplanned turn Jess' life takes?  How will Jess deal with an overwhelming tragedy? All storylines are nicely tied up and the viewer can sleep well knowing that, as always in the world of Rosamunde Pilcher, the great majority lives happily ever after.",1118793600,71,2149,4.862637362637362

1884507,5,B00009ME9U,"I thought this sequel to Coming Home might be a let down, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The ending was delightful and a very fitting conclusion to the storyline. I would definetly recommend this to any Rosemunde Pilcher fan.",1365033600,,231,4.8
1884508,5,B00009ME9U,"Nanchero is the sequel to ""Coming Home"".  I loved both movies -  If you liked Coming Home, you need to see Nanchero to complete the series and tied up loose ends!",1355529600,,162,4.193548387096774
1884509,1,B00009ME9U,"What an accomplishment: a sequel so bad it makes me regret having seen the original!  The script is incoherent.  Actors who were quite good in ""Coming Home"" - especially Patrick Ryecart and Joanna Lumley - are left to random plot points and dialogue so horrible that they seem mystified while reciting it - I hope they were well paid!  The character of Judith Dunbar - central to ""Coming Home"" - is relegated to the sidelines, and Emily Mortimer has been replaced with a charmless actress who spends her little screen time whining.  The plot involving Jess is completely unrealistic, as is the notion that Judith would sell the Dower House (which has disappeared in Nancherorow).  And the scriptwriters seem to have forgotten that Judith was left independently wealthy in ""Coming Home"".  As to Gus going from impoverished artist to savior of Nancherrow by virtue of a single New York art show....please.  Don't waste your money, especially as this is a rather pricey DVD.",1351987200,6,971,4.920245398773006
1884510,4,B00009ME9U,"I love Rosamunde Pilcher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coming-Home/dp/1569383634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coming Home</a>&nbsp;and only recently discovered that the sequel was out on DVD. I managed to get this DVD as an inter-library loan, and watched it tonight. Luckily for this production, most of the original cast members are back - the delightful Joanna Lumley reprises her role as Diana Carey-Lewis, Katie Ryder Richardson returns as headstrong Loveday Carey-Lewis, George Asprey as Dr. Jeremy Wells (Judith's husband), Susan Hampshire as St. Ursula's principal, Miss Catto, and Patrick Ryecart as the faithful Tommy Mortimer.

The glaring changes in casting are in the roles of Judith Dunbar, the main protagonist in Coming Home. Originally played by Emily Mortimer, the role is now played by Lara Joy-Korner. In addition, the role of Gus Callender, the love of Loveday's life, is now played by Phillip Moog. I was very disappointed with the changes and the new Judith is wooden and unconvincing in her portrayal, a letdown considering Emily Mortimer's luminescent portrayal of Judith in Coming Home. Luckily, Judith's role is not as prominent in this sequel, and it is Loveday who plays the main character here. Though I missed the actor playing the original Gus, I have to give credit to Phillip Moog for admirably acquitting himself in his role as successful artist Gus.

The story in this sequel centers on events after the patriarch of the Carey-Lewis clan dies (portrayed in Coming Home by Peter O'Toole). Loveday inherits the estate, and the burden of running the formidable mansion falls on her and her mother, Diana. Loveday's marriage to low-born Walter (Tristan Gemmill) is on the rocks, and though Loveday tries to hang on for the sake of their son Nat, the relationship flounders. When Loveday seeks out her old flame Gus in London, the pair rekindle their relationship. Soon, Loveday finds herself living with Gus at Nancherrow though their path to domestic bliss is fraught by arguments over the heavy cost of Nancherrow's upkeep.

Judith's character was a letdown for me, not only because of the casting change but also because of the way her character was written in the story. The strong-willed, independent Judith is replaced by a woman who feels lost for most of the story - Judith grieves at her inability to carry a baby to term, feels neglected by her successful and busy doctor husband, and feels inept and unable to tackle the challenges of raising her sister Jess, who had suffered major trauma as a result of her wartime experiences.

All the characters go through trial and tribulations, and in a way, grow up, and this is most evident in the portrayal of Loveday's character. Katie Ryder Richardson does an amazing job portraying the conflicted Loveday who refuses to let go of Nancherrow, even if it means she may lose everything else that is dear to her. The other stand-out performance here was that of Diana as played by Joanna Lumley. This veteran actress shines on screen and portrays the regal Diana with perfect composure. The score remains as haunting as ever, and the cinematography captures the ethereal beauty of Nancherrow and its surroundings, and for a brief moment, gives us all a glimpse into a time and lifestyle that is long gone.",1312588800,6,3335,5.181818181818182
1884511,5,B00009ME9U,"The person who wrote the screenplay for ""Nancherrow"" obviously must be a huge Pilcher fan and have read ""Coming Home"" more than once memorizing so many events from the novel.
Love to detail and very good character development as well as a compelling plot make this a worthy sequel to ""Coming Home"".
Enjoy!",1308096000,,305,4.773584905660377

I highly recommend it!",1256601600,11,260,4.6521739130434785
7991501,3,B00009ME9U,"This being the second part of an already established story line it is difficult not to judge it as a comparison to Coming Home. Many of the characters were re-cast, to this movies detriment. The new actors are not as strong nor the chemistry between everyone nearly as compelling; it has a much more stiff atmosphere, not as warm and familial. Even the extras aren't as compelling as the whole ensemble was the first time around. The touching relationship between Diana and Judith has disappeared, as has the strong bond between Judith and Loveday. However, Joanna Lumley is still great, as is the actor playing Dr. Jeremy and Tommy and the new addition of the Viscount. They remain charismatic as does the delightful surprise of Patrick Macnee, his chemistry with Joanna good as ever. Taken alone this movie has wonderful sets, locations, and costumes, setting a very real sense of the place and time. The story is supposed to be primarily about Loveday, but wonders off onto side stories, without developing any of them enough to particularly develop interest and making them seem like jarring filler - with the great exception of the love triangle story between Diana, Tommy, and the Viscount and Diana's troubles, which is much more interesting then the main storyline while mirroring it in many ways but is much more successful. However, part way through Diana kind of disappears from the action and you have no idea where she has gone, it is as if she disappeared from the house altogether and seems strange. They do pick up with her again some time later with little explanation as to what is going on. It rather feels as if perhaps the director couldn't figure out how to integrate all these characters and stories into an ensemble (which was successfully accomplished in the first one), and just decided to tackle them individually and mash them together from time to time. This doesn't have the emotion and feel-good element of Coming Home, however, the actress playing Loveday has grown on me and her acting strengthened somewhat for this second part.",1455408000,,2062,4.877492877492878
