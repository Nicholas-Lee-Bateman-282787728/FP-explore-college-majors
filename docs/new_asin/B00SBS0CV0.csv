6979567,5,B00SBS0CV0,"Ann Smith's experience comes through in this 2 disc video.  She is a marvelous example and inspiration of what she both teaches and practices. She is supple and graceful, and articulate about her work.  This is not so much about exercise in the typical sense as it is about movement and stretch done in a mindful and studied way. The strength aspects come from isometric holding in the muscles wherein the body provides its own resistance, rather than using weights or other resistance equipment.

My favorite aspect of her work is the reminder to lift the upper body up and out from the center, while working from the center.  This gives the feeling of length and space through the spine, a very nice effect after doing her video.  She also emphasizes working from a relaxed body and mind which is very helpful way to work because it is stress-relieving, but it does take practice.

Anne Smith is an inspiration, and she teaches excellent principles of movement. I would have liked to see another person working alongside her offering modified movement examples for people whoare novices or have limitations and might find her program intimidating the way she presents it.

I like the fact that she instructs to work up and out of the center of the body--this has been something I greatly appreciate practicing and feel a great effect after I do the video.

Ann Smith is a wonderful example of graceful and supple movement at her age. Her work in this case speaks for itself.

Doing Ann Smith's video does take patience and practice.  This would be my concern for the novice who is new to her work, or new to exercise at all. I recommend breaking down the moves and practicing them until they feel somewhat familiar and more comfortable, and then proceeding to practice the next moves the same way and so on. She recommends doing the work at your own pace and such, but I believe it would have been helpful to have another person on the stage with her who is doing the work at a modified range of motion in order to encourage and instruct those who have greater physical limitations or difficulty understanding how to properly modify the moves to avoid injury.

Bottom line, the principles she teaches are excellent. I have found greater physical ease, awareness and mobility through a consistent practice of about 3 times per week. Patience and consistency are keys that I must provide, but her work is worth the effort.",1442275200,10,2422,4.7156398104265405

6979570,5,B00SBS0CV0,A wonderful 2 DVD set! This is not only for Seniors! I found it to be just what I need. A gentle and effective way to improve flexibility and strength. I found her instructions to be clear and helpful. Ann's classical dance training brings an innovative approach to exercise. The exercise routines are done with classical music (Mozart!) in the background.  I look forward to seeing results. I am already feeling them. Ann is such a graceful beauty at 80 years old that you can't help but be inspired!,1425513600,13,501,4.629213483146067
8698000,3,B00SBS0CV0,Watch out.  All Ann Smith videos are the same exercise routine.  Changes clothes.  Changes music.  But same about 12 minutes of exercise in everyone.  It is good.  Buy one.  But only one.  Probably best Stretching for Seniors or Inhale/Exhale -- because easiest to use.,1527465600,,269,4.954545454545454

8698006,3,B00SBS0CV0,"Disappointed. More than first half of disk 1 requires floor exercise. Much too much talk and demo by Ann before participation stretching of last 10 minutes standing. Disk 2, too long a talk. Last 10 minutes actual participation.",1444608000,5,228,5.026315789473684
8698007,5,B00SBS0CV0,"Great for all ages- if you want to regain flexibility, recover from an injury or start an exercise program, this is for you. Has routines that are only 10 min. long, so everyone can do it.  I was hoping it would have the ""rise and shine"" portion of her exercises, but it is not on here.  Only the slow motion one and some of her faster speed ones.",1444521600,4,347,4.088235294117647
