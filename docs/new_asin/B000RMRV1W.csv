2869611,4,B000RMRV1W,I love Robert Parker's books and love Tom Selleck in these movies. The movie's are good but the books are better.,1188259200,,113,4.428571428571429
2869612,5,B000RMRV1W,These movies should be considered some of Tom Selleck's best.  I have a young daughter and she likes them also.  These are great for family viewing and I can't wait for the next to come out.,1187827200,4,190,4.25
2869613,5,B000RMRV1W,"I am a great fan of Robert B, Parker/Spenser/Jesse Stone. Having read all the Spenser series and Jesse Stone novels I was actually fearing disappointment with the movies.  I am happy to say the movies are fairly true to the themes and characters portrayed by Robert B. Parker.  I especially liked the music and camera editing to give the series an unhurried and thoughtful pace.  Parker's characters are always somewhat introspective about their flaws and if I have any criticism it is that the movies kind of skip over this signature characteristic.  They do, however, tell the stories in their own way and at their own pace while remaining true to the essence of the plots and characters in Paradise.  If you are a Robert B. Parker fan you will not be disappointed in the series.  SPOILER ALERT:  Molly is a real surprise but holds her own in the series.",1187827200,,856,4.666666666666667
2869614,5,B000RMRV1W,Written by Robert Parker (he wrote a lot of books that were transferred to made for movie tv). Plus Tom Selleck does a superb job of being the deadpan hero.  Kicks rear when and where it's needed.  Definitely worth every penny.,1186531200,6,227,4.512195121951219
2869615,5,B000RMRV1W,"Excellent series based on the Robert Parker books. Tom Selleck plays Chief Jesse Stone. The movies are well done productions with superb acting, beautiful scenery, and good music. The quality of the DVDs is first class. These are the first three DVDs to be released. The stories cover how Stone lost his job for drinking on the job in L.A. to him resolving cases as Chief of the Paradise, Massachusetts police. The movies aren't full of action, but they more than make up for that in acting, storylines, and scenery. The supporting cast includes Viola Davis and Kohl Sudduth. They have guest stars like Saul Rubinek and Stephen Baldwin. I highly recommend this series.",1184630400,19,668,4.868421052631579
2869616,5,B000RMRV1W,"Great Tom Selleck series.
My late husband really enjoyed watching these.
I have lent them out to many friends.
Enjoyable!!!",1365552000,,123,5.2
2869617,5,B000RMRV1W,"I am a Jesse Stone fan from his books so when it came out in film, it was fun to see it all acted out.  They arrived in a very timely fashion and in mint condition.  Very pleased.",1347494400,,179,3.6842105263157894
2869618,5,B000RMRV1W,"I bought all these seperately for it cost a lot more to buy the collection they way they are selling it.

I love the feel of these movies.  Tom Selleck is perfect as Jesse Stone.  I have seen most of them on T.V. but, I wanted to enjoy them without all the friggin commercials.

Television should be renamed Merrcial Vision.  A 2 hour show has only 121 minutes of actual movie.  A one hour show has 22 mins of show... c'mon people this is just friggin ridiculous ! ! !",1331078400,,468,4.144444444444445
2869619,5,B000RMRV1W,"No special effects, just solid intelligent acting, and screen play.  A pleasure to watch actors develop the series into a comfortable family like group.  Hope the series continues in spite of the death of the Author.",1292976000,,216,4.972222222222222
2869620,5,B000RMRV1W,The Jesse Stone movies are good. Can't wait for the last one to come out.,1198886400,,73,3.933333333333333
2869621,5,B000RMRV1W,The product was exactly as it said it would be.  Shipping was fast and great communication.,1198540800,,91,4.6875
2869622,5,B000RMRV1W,"The Jessie Stone series is the best collection of crime stories I've seen.  Tom Selleck has this character nailed down perfectly, and the writing is top notch, with great characters that you really care about, and plot twists that will knock you out!
The cinematography effectively captures the dark mood and the seaside location is perfect.  The producers have a HUGE winner here, far and away the best cop shows available on DVD, right up there with the phenomenally successful BBC detective series  ""A Touch of Frost"", which I consider to be the best drama collection of all time.",1198195200,3,583,4.8686868686868685
2869623,5,B000RMRV1W,If you are a Tom Sellec or Jesse Stone fan these are a must see.  We found them in a local BlockBuster and enjoyed them so much we had to have them.  Good story line and Tom Sellec does a fantastic job as a alcholic police cheif.,1197936000,,229,3.851063829787234
2869624,4,B000RMRV1W,3 discs in collection 2 played ok and third one (STONE COLD)kept being kicked out of 2 different players so in order to watch it I had to play it on my computer.,1196812800,,161,3.909090909090909
2869625,5,B000RMRV1W,The set of Jesse Stone movies came as advertised. Perfect condition and great to watch.,1196553600,,87,4.866666666666666
2869626,5,B000RMRV1W,"Excellent murder mysteries. Selleck at his Best. Not your run of the mill
storyline. Keeps you glued to the screen.",1196553600,,115,4.8
2869627,5,B000RMRV1W,"Have been a long time Tom Selleck fan.  Theses movies were made for TV but his character does not lack grit, nor do the movies.  Selleck portays a darker, private character than his normal screen persona - fighting alcohol as well as the bad guys. He portrays a tender side, too - but with only a few of the characters who seem to need a friend (like troubled teens going through rough times). He just carries off the role extremely well.  I'm glad I watched these without commercials as story breaks would have detracted from the continuity of the stories.  Very well done.  If you like detective stories with what seems like a strong dose of reality, these may be for you.",1196294400,3,674,4.491803278688525
2869628,5,B000RMRV1W,"If a role ever 'fit' an actor perfectly, Robert B. Parker's alcoholic, laconic ex-L.A. cop/small town Police Chief Jesse Stone 'fits' Tom Selleck. Paunchier and more careworn than in his ""Magnum"" days, Selleck has become a superb character actor, and this series of TV-movies offers him at the 'top of his game'.

While murder is the theme of each film, the stories are even more enjoyable as character studies of a man rebuilding his life. Divorced, but still holding long phone conversations with his ex-wife, Stone has turned to whiskey for solace, costing him his job with the L.A.P.D., but not yet diminishing his skills to a point where he can't get a strong endorsement for the position of Police Chief of tiny Paradise, Massachusetts, a coastal town near Boston. The first film of the series, ""Stone Cold"", presents him already in place as Chief; it's success led to ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"", a prequel detailing his arrival in Paradise, the murder of the previous Chief, and the death of his beloved dog; the third film of this collection, ""Jesse Stone: A Death in Paradise"", the follow-up to ""Stone Cold"", finds him attempting to deal with his alcoholism, while investigating the death of a teen-aged girl.

Best of all, for fans of this series, a fourth film aired in 2007, with a fifth TV-movie in production for 2008.

If you are a fan of Parker's novels, Tom Selleck, or murder mysteries rich in character development, ""The Jesse Stone Film Collection"" deserves a place on your shelf!",1192665600,20,1502,4.859375
2869629,5,B000RMRV1W,"The Jesse Stone series includes three (now four) of the best detective/mystery movies I've ever watched.  Tom Selleck is superb in his rendition of an unhappy, displaced, but decent, brilliant, and extremely competent police detective, Jesse Stone.  Jesse, having been dismissed for drinking on duty in his job as a Los Angeles police detective, and having gone through a heartbreaking divorce, travels to a small New England town seeking to start a new life.  He goes there, having been hired as the town's new chief of police.

Making a few fine friends and forming an interesting and intimate relationship with an extremmely lovely young woman named Abbey Taylor,
Jesse gradually builds a life.  As in real life, however, challenges, disappointments, and even disasters occur.

Each movie includes one or more fascinating mystery plots, cases that are solved by the brilliant chief of police and his associates.  Through it all, Selleck's superb performance of Jesse Stone's independence, willingness to break the rules, and dry sense of humor add immensely to the quality of these already excellent movies.

Plot, writing, character development, acting, music, and photography are all of very high quality. If you enjoy good mystery and/or good drama, you'll love the Jesse Stone Series.",1191542400,,1291,5.294117647058823
2869630,5,B000RMRV1W,"These aren't epic masterpieces or stunning works of art, but are great entertainment with a very human protagonist. Fans of Connelly, Rankin and such will enjoy these. Make some more!",1190764800,,183,5.133333333333334
2869631,5,B000RMRV1W,Excellent intertainment.  Tom Selleck is perfect for the role and the supporting actors are wonderful as well.  My family has watched them over and over and still are not tired of them. Beats anything on T.V.,1189555200,3,208,4.75
2869632,5,B000RMRV1W,"this has to be the epitome of good casting, Selleck may be in the singular best role of his career not withstanding,his part of Matthew Quigley in ""Quigley down under"", or that of the 80's superb Magnum p.i.,also see his work in the Sacketts,all pieces fit to be remembered and awarded.this time there is more to be seen of the formation of a character,not all nice but, that truely reflects life doesn't it?. No this is serial extention of a role at its best, and the fact that the supporting cast are all positively studied is a bonus to the completeness, they make me look forward to the rest of the stories as they appear,my final plaudit is for the wonderful writing of Robert B. Parker, great stuff for a winters night or two.",1189296000,8,732,4.470149253731344
2869633,4,B000RMRV1W,The story has a cold but strong feeling to Jesse.  Makes me want to give him support to stop drinking and tell him he can do it. Completely enjoyed the story.........Jesse Stone is a very in depth character and I can't wait for the next story in the series.  Love the dog connection!!!,1188864000,2,285,4.3584905660377355
2869634,3,B000RMRV1W,I just love the Jesse Stone storyline by Rob Parker. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book in this series and hope that Tom Selleck will continue to make the movies.,1188691200,2,164,4.5
2869635,5,B000RMRV1W,"All three movies in the Jesse Stone collection are excellent.  Tom Selleck plays a very convincing LAPD detective that moves to a small town in the north east.  He is hired because the town council believes he is incompetent and they can continue in their ""wicked ways"".  However, they find out differently.",1188345600,2,307,4.865384615384615
8201473,5,B000RMRV1W,Love these movies,1518480000,,17,5.0

8201475,5,B000RMRV1W,I like all of the Jesse Stone videos. This collection is no exception,1447977600,,69,4.384615384615385
8201476,5,B000RMRV1W,"I am new to the Jesse Stone series and ordered the 3 pack collection.  To stay in proper sequence of the series, I carefully read the triple feature on the back of the collection.  Seemed Stone Cold first was 2005 so I watched this.  It was excellent; I can't think of a better actor to play the role of Jesse Stone.  However, in this movie, Jesse Stone was already in ""Paradise"".  I then watched #2: Death in Paradise released in 2006.  After watching this, I watched #3 Night Passage also released in 2006 only to realize this is actually the first of the series.  Here one can see how it is that Jesse Stone moved to Paradise to pursue a new life and meets his new staff.  Once you see Night Passage, everything else falls into place.  Tom Selleck is awesome as Chief Stone with an easy-going-yet to the point-mannerism that is uniquely his as portrayed in the current Blue Blood television series.  The stories are enjoyable and clean; a refreshing change from the graphic violence now so dominant.  The scenery is calming and beautiful as is the background music.  Great collection!",1447632000,,1087,4.604166666666667
8201477,5,B000RMRV1W,"Love all the Jesse Stone movies. It keeps you guessing on what,s what.",1437782400,,70,4.461538461538462

8201479,5,B000RMRV1W,"Any Tom Selleck fan must follow this series.  Most are very well done and Jesse Stone makes the difference.  But you will be pleasantly surprised by the ""friendships"" he develops throughout this series.  Great for mystery lovers or Robert Parker fans.",1399507200,,251,5.073170731707317
8201480,5,B000RMRV1W,"We really enjoy the scenery, the music and it doesn't need words when the mood is set and the actors can convey the story with their expressions. We have the whole series and hope there will be more.",1376784000,,199,4.2631578947368425
8201481,5,B000RMRV1W,I love Tom Sellick and this series he was great in.  I really wished that there were more Jesse Stone stories for him to do!!  I've watched these DVD's many times and never tire of them!  A good watch!,1368489600,,201,4.102564102564102
