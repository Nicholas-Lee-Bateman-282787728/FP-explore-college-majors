8012701,3,B0001GH6W8,"I rented this from the red envelope in your mailbox company.  That said...

The practice and sequencing:  This is an older yoga program from 2004 or so.  It's not a flow.  It's more of a relation and restorative DVD made up poses that are held for really long times.  Some poses I had to fast forward through because it was just too long. The entire DVD is 64 minutes in length, and that's with just a three-minute ""tranquility"" pose, as Kali Ray calls savasana.  Overall, the sequencing was very good and definitely relaxing.

Music:  It does get irritating since there's so little variation, but it's typical of ""yoga"" music I've heard just with less variation.  The instrument is used a lot on yoga DVDs, but I can't think of the name of it.

Set:  it's filmed in an outdoor garden that is lovely.

Instructor: Kali Ray is very limber.  Although she shows modifications, she rarely speaks HOW to do them.  However, if you know anything about yoga, they are easy to modify without looking at the DVD.  Her voice is very soothing.

I prefer a slow flow with long stretches at the end. Because this is made up all long stretches, it's not one I'd do again. However, on the evening I used this DVD, I had a headaches and was exhausted.  It was nearly perfect for how I was feeling, and I did feel better after doing the DVD.

I recommend this DVD to those with tight hips, low back pain or generally stressed all over.  It's definitely relaxing.

I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.",1402272000,,1481,4.431226765799257
8012702,5,B0001GH6W8,"Love her videos and yoga - gentle, easy to follow. Perhaps a little slow at times, but that's just the challenge of slowing down in our lives. Great for beginners or experienced yoginis looking for something new.",1361577600,,212,4.756756756756757
8012703,1,B0001GH6W8,"The production values are poor (horrible music, bad costuming).

The exercises themselves are fine, but the amount of time she has you hold them is excessive.  I did the video once and only got through 70%.  I now have SI joint dysfunction.  Do not buy this video.",1256774400,,264,4.553191489361702
8012704,5,B0001GH6W8,"This non-tradtional yoga DVD is more like a Kundalini style practice.  It differs from the Kundalini DVD's that I've used in that it is very peaceful and stress relieving.  On some DVD's the movement is so vigorous and strength-building that it doesn't often feel peaceful.  Kali Ray's voice and instruction are so calming that, if I do this DVD or the Gentle Cardio DVD before bed, I sleep all night for at least 7 hours.
Some of the poses are held up longer to make sure you totally relax that muscle.
I keep talking about relaxing, but there are some strength building asanas (leg lifts, hip rotations, etc) but they are done slowly and calmly.
I throughly enjoyed this DVD as I have all of Kali Ray's DVD's so far.",1210032000,4,718,4.507692307692308
8012705,5,B0001GH6W8,"I have bursitis in my hips.  I also injured my back recently, so right at the moment I am not in the best shape.  Right now the bursitis in the right hip is flaring and it hurts!

I was so excited when this arrived in the mail!  I had high hopes for it!  And I was not disappointed!

Here's the order in which it goes:

PLAY PROGRAM
SELECT SEGMENTS

1.  Rhythmic Breathing - relaxing breathing on your back

2.  Bridge Rolls - On your back you raise the hips up and down.  This is nice, flowing and slow.

3.  Hip/Side Stretch - On your back, you roll to one side with the head facing up and hold for nice long time, stretching.  Then you do the other side.  This is done just once on each side.  Nice and long and slow.

4.  Leg Stretch - On your back, your leg goes up and down, then held up there for a while.  She shows variations with a belt (can be done with a towel) and a foam brick for the head (can be done with a pillow).  None of the variations are required, just variances.

5.  Hip Rotations/Knee to Chest - On your back, you have your leg in the air and are rotating the leg around.  After both legs are done you bring the knee to the chest.

6.  Reclining Tree - On your back, you bend your leg at the knee and hold.

7.  Spider - On your back, you bend both knees and hold your feet then rock.  Your legs are open wide.

8.  Cradle - On your back, one leg bent, the other bent and on top of one leg and you have your arms around legs.

9.  Reclined Twist - Similar to Hip/Side Stretch.  On your back your knees are bent and you twist from side to side.

10.  Reclined Free Seat - On your back your legs are folded Indian Style on the ground and you hold.

11.  Reclined Butterfly - Similar to Reclined Free seat only your legs are in a diamond shape and not folded.

12.  Tranquility/Deep Relaxation - Deep relaxation

This DVD goes nice and slow.  The poses will help you if you have any hip issues.  I had a bout of bursitis and I definitely feel better after doing just one of the poses on this DVD tonight.

Someone mentioned the music.  If you are familiar with yoga music (slow) you'll like this music, it flows with this dvd.

I'm going to probably buy more Kali Ray yoga dvds.",1160006400,20,2201,4.037383177570093
8012706,4,B0001GH6W8,"I have been doing yoga for several years now and consider myself to be an intermediate yogi.  This DVD does not contain traditional yoga moves like downward facing dog, cobra, forward bends, etc.  I like to do this workout at least once a week because it is so good at relaxing the hips and lower back.  I don't have to even think about what I'm doing during the hour long workout.  I sort of get into a meditation phase.  This workout has a definite place in my library, but is not for someone who is looking for a true yoga workout.  A beginner will not learn any of the classic postures, but will enjoy the benefits.",1120694400,9,619,4.293103448275862
8012707,2,B0001GH6W8,"I gave this two stars because the poses/stretches really are good for your hips. What I can't take is the awful background ""music"" which is akin to the humming sound a light bulb that is about to fail makes. It actually gave me a headache and I couldn't finish the practice. Her shortened instructions are irritating, at least to me. She doesn't speak in complete sentences, ever. Everything is ""knee to chest"" or ""arms to sides"". This goes on for nearly an hour. There is also no flow to this video; it's just one hip opening pose after another, which isn't a bad thing if you just want to work on tight hips.",1101340800,5,610,4.407079646017699
8012708,5,B0001GH6W8,"Hi, I started Kali Ray TriYoga three months ago and I bought that DVD (and some others from Kali Ray) to deepen my practice. I have never practiced Yoga before so I cannot say something about this style in comparison with others. However I love the soft and gentle moves of Kali Ray TriYoga.

The DVD starts with rhythmic breathing. Then the practices: Bridge Rolls (1+2), Hip Side Stretch, Leg Stretch, Hip Rotations/One Knee to Chest, Reclined Tree, Spider, Cradle, Reclined Twist, Reclined Free Seat, and Reclined Butterfly. It ends with a couple of minutes deep relaxation in the tranquilly pose.

All the practices are done lying on your back and are a very good way to relax. I almost fall asleep during Reclined Free Seat :).

Like in the other DVDs (Strengthening, gentle cardio), Kali Ray has a very gentle voice and explains the flow very nicely. If you have practiced Yoga before you should have no problems to follow her without looking on the screen. Beginners may have to watch the DVD first and then try the movements. However, no DVD will ever replace a yoga teacher who can correct you and help to improve your practices.",1092614400,10,1138,4.708542713567839
