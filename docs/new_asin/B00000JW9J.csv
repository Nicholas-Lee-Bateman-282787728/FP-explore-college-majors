1238776,5,B00000JW9J,"Several fellow climbers who had viewed this video before making successful  attempts on Aconcagua recommended it to me. They said it gives a very  accurate portrayal of what it's like on this massive peak. I'm extremely  glad I bought it. I feel much more prepared for the climb. Although  Aconcagua isn't a technical climb, in that it doesn't require rock or ice  climbing, it is extremely challenging based on its size alone.
The  reviewer from Columbus, OH seems to think it's not a serious mountain, but  I beg to differ. And to clarify another erroneous piece of information in  that review -- this video doesn't follow the normal or ""regular""  route. It follows the more ambitious False Polish route.
This video is  very polished, professional, well written, and  entertaining. I  whole-heartedly recommend it.",968889600,8,816,5.052631578947368
1238777,3,B00000JW9J,"Yes, Aconcagua is the highest peak in the western hemisphere and a big challenge for the high altitude climber, but the route taken by the Media  Ventures (family) film crew, along with the rest of the climbing team,  takes the viewer up to the summit via the easiest route on the mountain.  Through out the entire film, I did not see a single ice axe, or a pair of  crampons being used by any of the team members, on any section of their  climb. Though... it is kind of interesting to see climbers reach a 7000  meter peak, wearing their trekking boots and holding on to their trekking  poles. For the mountaineer who is trying to attack the more techical routes  on this mountain, this film will serve no purpose. For the trekker/climber  who wants to sit on top of the ""Roof of the Americas"", this video  is very informative about the region and its people, as well as the  ""regular route"" to the top of this giant. Regardless of the  route, this roof sits at an exteme high altitude, where no man can survive  for an extended period of time.",967075200,3,1045,4.408376963350785
1238778,5,B00000JW9J,One of the best mountaineering videos I've seen. It offers a great mix of breathtaking scenery and emotional drama. It's well written and very professionally put together. This is an entertaining video for both the  climber and non-climber alike.,944179200,,246,5.3076923076923075
7913541,5,B00000JW9J,"Great video and it gave you a clear representation, I believe, of what to expect.  No gear guide or anything like that, but it showed the routes the group went on, the problems on each route, and was crisp and clear, though a bit dated now (shot in 1998).  I am climbing the mountain later this year, and it gave me lots to think about before I go.  I am not sure where any of the negative reviews are coming from.  Based on the description, this video delivered what was promised.",1425427200,,481,4.252747252747253
7913542,5,B00000JW9J,"If you want to catch a glimpse of how difficult it is to climb Aconcagua, then this it for you.  A gritty tale.  It might interest anyone investigating the Seven Summits.",1273190400,2,170,4.451612903225806
7913543,4,B00000JW9J,"This was an excellent video.  It was very factual and realistic.  Gave a good account of the work and determination that is needed on this mountain.  Also shows the realities of high altitude lack of oxygen.  This mountain is not to be taken lightly.  Great video!

7913544,4,B00000JW9J,This is a very detailed overview of what is entailed in climbing to the highest mountain in South America. The film crew follows the team of climbers to the top of a non-technical route to the summit and shows what physical strengths are needed to make it to the top. As altitude saps the strength from some a few must descend. The movie does not try to glorify the climb as in Everest but simply follows the day to day life of the climbers. From packing their bags at base camp to dealing with the high winds on the summit ridge. If you plan to climb this mountain you must see this movie. If you are looking for a movie which has aspects of technical mountaineering and mountaineering skills this is not the movie for you.,1175731200,3,724,4.330882352941177
7913545,4,B00000JW9J,"This is an excellent, informative documentary that chronicles one climbing party's trek to Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the Americas, as well as its ascent. It visually documents the fourteen days which it took the climbing party to reach the summit.

The film details many points of interest. It discusses the three major approaches to Aconcagua. The most popular one is the Horcones Valley approach which seventy five percent of all climbers opt for and is considered the normal route. It is an eighteen mile trek to base camp at Plaza De Mulas.

The most difficult, the South Face approach, is also the shortest in length: a mere thirteen miles to base camp at Plaza Francia. Yet, its difficulty is such that only five percent of all climbers opt for this route.

The climbing party in the film, which consisted of two guides and six climbers, chose the third route, the Vacas and Relinchos Valley approach, which twenty percent of all climbers choose. This is the longest route, as it is a twenty four mile, picturesque trek to base camp at Plaza Argentina.

It was interesting to view the party's progress. Other than altitude sickness experienced by several members of the party, the ascent was fairly unremarkable. The weather stayed relatively good. It seemed like a very mellow climb. The party made it seem fairly effortless. I was surprised to see no use of ice axes or crampons, gear usually associated with high altitude climbing.

The film adds some interesting regional information and is, overall, very well done. It makes one all the more interested in possibly undertaking a climb up Aconcagua and is a good primer, if one is considering such an ambitious undertaking.

Yet, no one should be lulled into thinking that climbing Aconcagua is a piece of cake. It is still a high altitude climb. Should anyone need to be reminded of its dangers, bear in mind that the year this documentary was filmed, sixteen climbers perished on the mountain. Do not underestimate Aconcagua.",1119916800,22,1996,4.908011869436201
7913546,2,B00000JW9J,"We saw a copy of our friends before going on the second Field Touring filmed trip last year. It didn't really tell the story of climbing aconcagua, but I guess it is different for us as we have been there. The Field Touring film is being sold to cable tv, its pretty good by all accounts but not purchasable from them. (Probably on National Geographic) you can try to contact , their version was shot over 3 years and is a very compete account of the climb - I think we are even on it!!",1050278400,,486,4.126315789473685
7913547,2,B00000JW9J,"You have to give them full credit for trying, its not easy to take a camera up a big hill for 2 weeks, but for people with some climbing or trekking experience this film is likely to prove a disapointment.
Our tape quality was not good, and there were few moments of apparent elation, suspense, or any other of the good ingredients that go into a compelling documentary experience.
Like the reviewer below, our  tape also broke (snapped actually), after a couple of months and just 3 or 4 showings.
Try and catch the National Geographic TV doco on the Australian guiding company ""Field Touring"", who took a group up in 1999, that was a very real and compelling drama, and its free....",1033430400,,684,4.560975609756097
7913548,5,B00000JW9J,"I received this video as a gift before I left for my climb of the mountain. You can read books, surf the Web, and look at maps but there's something about seeing one team's experience first hand that really gives you a leg up on what to expect. It's great to see the trip unfold from the moment they land and to hear their live, first-hand accounts of how they feel and what they think. I was surprised to read that a previous reviewer thought the video was a bit amateurish. The crew managed to film during horrible weather, winds, and sickness all the way to the summit -- an impressive feat. The quality of the video was very professional and the story was extremely well told. I recommend this video to anyone interested in Aconcagua or to anyone interested in a well-told adventure story.",1017878400,4,793,4.475862068965517
7913549,4,B00000JW9J,"The movie has a 'home video' feel, and yet it is a very useful tool for anybody who has in mind to climb Aconcagua along the ""Falso de los Polacos"" route (see Secor's guidebook for more details on the route). I watched the movie several times before actually climbing the mountain, and found it extremely useful. It gives an idea of the challenges one will have to face (mostly altitude, and weather). It is regrettable that the movie does not have any scene filmed in the Canaleta, the crux of the climb along the Normal route (and the Falso route connects with the Normal route a few hours below the Canaleta). Also, the movie does not show any use of crampons, though on summit day it is often necessary to use them to cross a snow field after Independencia, as well as on the Schiller ice just before the Canaleta. All in all, however, a really enjoyable, stimulating, and somewhat inspiring movie.",1016409600,,902,4.574074074074074
