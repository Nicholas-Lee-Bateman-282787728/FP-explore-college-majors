4885720,3,B005SKAZDE,"Does anyone else have problems with the audio on the second lecture?  Audio for the first and third have been just fine, but second nothing.

I've been listening to the great courses from Audible and I was pleased to see that some of them are coming in video lecture format.  I've purchased and watched two of the math great courses, this is my third purchase.  The weakest by far.  In fact, I fell asleep about half way into the third lecture last night, obviously didn't keep my interest enough to keep me awake.

Maybe my expectations were a little off, i should have probably watched the free trailer before I decided to buy this.  But i was expecting much more than talking about one picture a lecture and giving what I thought was kind of an amateur/introductory lecture of astronomy to go with the single picture in the lecture.  I guess from the name of the lectures its obvious were only focusing on one issue, but i expected multiple pictures of it and maybe some pictures of other items similar to it.

In reality, with just covering the single picture in a course.  And simply just having that picture or the professor talking, I could have done just about as well with an audio only lecture.  With the benefit of the audio only lecture being able to listen on car rides and while mowing the lawn.",1431043200,,1309,4.504237288135593

4885724,5,B005SKAZDE,"I have watched many of The Great Courses series. They are universally high quality, with professors that are consistently both among the leaders in their fields AND truly engaging and inspiring teachers.

Experiencing Hubble is one of the shorter series at only 12 lectures, and I agree with some reviewers that Professor Meyer is a bit dry and monotone compared to most of the professors chosen to teach The Great Courses; but it's hard to argue with the choice. He really knows what he's talking about, and he definitely picks up the pace after lecture #4.

Like most of The Great Courses series, this series gives you a level of depth you're simply not going to find anywhere else. It's not a comprehensive survey of the universe, or of the thousands of images taken by Hubble. Rather, it's a deep dive into the telescope itself, followed by a study of ten of the most spectacular images it has produced, and how they have advanced our understanding of the universe. Along the way, you will learn about the discovery of galaxies and how we now count them, about gravitational lenses, about the very of our sun, and much more.",1429833600,,1128,4.691919191919192

4885731,1,B005SKAZDE,"Sorry, but a lecture with images?  Given what Hubble has to offer, this was a BIG disappointment.  And David Meyer comes across more like an undertaker than someone who should be narrating the program.  Just not what I had hoped for.",1423872000,,233,4.634146341463414
4885732,5,B005SKAZDE,"I really appreciated Dr. Meyer's ability to speak so eloquently and passionately about this subject. His selections were well-thought out, and represented various aspects & stages of the universe, ending with the future for Hubble & beyond. I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in astronomy or cosmology at any level. Definitely five stars!",1418774400,4,350,5.5

4885735,5,B005SKAZDE,"Why was Hawking's History of Time [both editions] so enormously popular? The Sunday Times [London] captured my heart and my always wondering child's awe: ""This book marries a child's wonder to a genius's intellect. We journey into Hawking's universe while marvelling at his mind.""

While still very young [before even dreaming of later teaching college], I was generously invited to spend time in a scientist's lab. It was as though the Heavens opened---an intellect's office, fun-filled, happy, every moment filled with my gratitude to the experience and generous, smiling, open warmth of my host.

WONDERMENT! The same for countless humans, wondering if Hubble had indeed opened us to the eternal, to the Heavens. Hubble is a phenomenon unexpected, it is an experience of such unexpected WONDER that a person of religious belief or an atheist is equally knocked off his or her feet. To actually look billions of years into the past with the clarity, scope and colored vistas of a telescope made by humans but opening the skies to visions beyond imagination. The word repeats itself to me when I think ""Hubble"" :WONDERMENT! WONDERMENT! And it takes me with genuine humility to that lab when I was a mere child. My host's name is not important, but in his brief history of time he received The Nobel Prize. His intellect belongs in the Hubble Sky.

8485209,5,B005SKAZDE,"I decided to watch this course because of the 25th anniversary of the Hubble telescope. I did not entirely know what to expect with this course, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Except for the introduction and conclusion, each lesson focuses on one of the top ten images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. The introduction gives the history of the telescope including the early saga of a defective mirror that almost ruined the program and the efforts by astronauts to repair it in space. The substantive lectures start with an amazing Hubble image. Each of the images rightly deserves to be considered ""fine art"" for the breathtaking beauty and spirit-moving depth. What surprised me, though, was how the professor discussed each image. Rather than pick apart the image or point out every detail, the professor uses the image as a springboard to explain the science behind what the image represents. For instance, in one of the images of faraway galaxies he discusses how the lensing effect created the image and then went on to give the best explanation of the theory of general relativity that I have ever heard (and I took calculus-based physics in college). After the very informative scientific explanation, the professor then turns to the image and points out details that a casual observer would miss, much like a fine arts class would be taught. He also examines other images of similar objects, so you get to enjoy more great images than just the top ten selected as the basis for the lectures. The professor's history of the telescope's namesake, Edwin Hubble, was particularly well done. This course is fantastic for anyone with even a small interest in science and has considerable potential to be enjoyed by someone only interested in the artistic value of Hubble's wonderful images.",1489449600,,1806,4.983443708609271
