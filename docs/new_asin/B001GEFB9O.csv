8305155,4,B001GEFB9O,"We enjoyed watching this DVD, however, consider what you want to get out of the DVD before ordering it.  I don't think it is exactly an ""instructional"" DVD but more of documentary of this type of fighting.",1360540800,,205,4.54054054054054
8305156,5,B001GEFB9O,"awsome dvd, it was simple to watch and easy enough that it held the attention of my teenage daughters. I would suggest this product for anyone that wants to learn about the art from a beginners standpotnt.",1351814400,,205,4.5675675675675675
8305157,2,B001GEFB9O,"Hey guys, I got my Krav Maga dvd even in the package I could hear it rattling around. I got it out, and it was scratched to heck. The tactics that it teaches seem easy enough to employ, the problem was the disk was so mangled I could barely get 5 mintues in.",1316044800,,258,3.8867924528301887
8305158,5,B001GEFB9O,"First, Avi Nardia is the real deal. I had the great opportunity to train with him in Israel in the 1980s and when I watched this video all these years later, I could see that the excellent manner in which he presents the subject of KAPAP or Krav Maga is still incomparable. From the very beginning of this video Avi is no nonsense, straight forward, totally believable and realistic, but not without humor. That is his personality. He is a master, self assured, and yet not without some humility. The techniques he presents here  from his many years in the combat/self defense field are immediately usable, but they are also clearly taken from the solid traditional martial arts background he has. Often I see techniques presented in DVDs and seminars that just will not work in a real fight situation, and often by a ""master"" who has certain martial arts skills, but who lacks the skills necessary for real combat. Avi is capable of both, and although it is impossible to become proficient in the martial arts by watching a video, this DVD gives the viewer some amazingly versatile techniques that do not require years of training. Avi would be the first to say that anyone interested in this DVD should seek out a qualified martial arts' sensei/master whose bent is in self defense and not tournament. There are many out there. But this DVD is a wonderful beginning down that path, and for the experienced martial artist, it will make you think about your own art and the tech. you have learnt and whether they are sufficient for that one unfortunate moment where they might be put to the test. For this reason, I highly recommend this DVD.",1275782400,3,1642,4.681660899653979
8305159,5,B001GEFB9O,"Like all books & DVDs produced on Krav Maga or it's variants-Kapap,Lotar,etc,this is a ""no fluff"" instructional DVD intended for very serious offensive/defensive application. After viewing this fine video,my first thought was ""who do I dislike enough to con into practicing these techniques on?"" This is light years of difference from the Okinowan Nung Gogu Rhu I studied long ago. I look foreward to purchasing the other 3 DVDs of this series.",1245369600,9,444,5.180555555555555
8305160,5,B001GEFB9O,"I would like to recommend this good DVD to
anyone who want to learn about real self defense.
This DVD is about the basic principles
and concepts of the Kapap system.
