8682021,4,B00O4GES0E,"I enjoy the message. Be more like a kid and have fun. Do what you enjoy and be merry. Favorite quote, ""You don't stop playing because you get old. You get old because you stop playing."" Oh yeah, the skiing is burly too. Cody Townsend won ""line of the year"" for what he did in this movie. Watch...you'll know which one I'm talking about. Doesn't score high for originality but it's entertaining and plenty of sick skiing.",1475798400,,420,4.467532467532467
