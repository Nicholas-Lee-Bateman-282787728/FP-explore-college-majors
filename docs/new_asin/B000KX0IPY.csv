2697920,5,B000KX0IPY,"SONY Pictures and Columbia Tristar are to blame for the amazingly slow release of classics like ""All in the Family"".  It's a shame that they got their hands on the NORMAN LEAR shows.  It really is.  They don't know how to give the proper respect to these timeless TV shows.  To take 11 years to release all of the Archie Bunker episodes is phenominally stupid.  The technology is changing so fast for one thing and why would a studio with time-proven classics on their hand purposely withhold them from the of the complaints are falling on deaf ears.  SONY Pictures really doesn't care about what the public wants.  I've been waiting years and years to see MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN again and have written and telephones SONY Pictures to no avail.  I've also been waiting for MAUDE to be released too.  Both of these shows were Norman Lear gems.  But SONY Pictures will not release these shows.  It's a shame because Norman Lear was THE television producer of the 1970's.  He conceived of one billiant classic after another.  It's really a shame that the rights to these shows slipped through his hands and into the hands of SONY.  I give 5 stars to this DVD set, because it is Archie Bunker.  I wish I could give 0 stars to SONY and Columbia Tristar Home Video.",1166400000,7,1263,4.551111111111111
2697921,5,B000KX0IPY,"The rate at which these seasons are being released is so pitifully slow it detracts from ones enjoyment of the series. It took 5 years to get to season 6, and there  are still 3 seasons to go, not to mention 3 additional seasons of Archie Bunker's place which have yet to be released. Let's go with the remaining seasons so I can enjoy them before I retire!",1165881600,19,357,4.25
2697922,5,B000KX0IPY,"I was under the mistaken impression that season 5 was the last of All in the Family and it became Archie Bunker's Place after that. So it was a suprise to me to see that there are seasons 6, 7, 8 and 9 from the other reviewers. Being an average tv fan it would be nice to know just how many seasons we can look forward to on these dvd box sets. Because of the long time between this set and the last, I had wrote off my All in the Family dvd collection as complete. Now it will be nice to look forward to more seasons! Update: All in the Family seasons 1-9 then Archie Bunker's Place seasons 1-4. Thanks to fellow reviewers!",1165536000,4,624,4.040322580645161
2697923,5,B000KX0IPY,"The 1975-76 season,the sixth of All In The Family,begins with Gloria Bunker Stivic(Sally Struthers) and her ""Meathead"" husband Michael(Rob Reiner) ""movin' on up"" to a place of their own in their former next-door-neighbors' home,occupied by George,Louise and Lionel Jefferson who had moved to a ""dee-luxe apartment in the sky"" in Manhattan(George's brother Henry even lived with them for a while). Another major highlight is Gloria giving birth to her and Michael's son Joey. I incorrectly mentioned this in the review for the season 5 set. Gloria's father Archie(the late great Carroll O'Connor),coming from a minstrel show in blackface,and her mother Edith(Jean Stapleton) arrive at the hospital in time to meet their new grandson. Archie accidentally entered a room occupied by a female patient who had long blonde hair like Gloria. The horrified woman phoned for help(""There's a big fat black man in here!""). Also there's one episode where Edith was upset with Archie because he hardly romances her and takes her anywhere anymore like he did when they were dating. So she goes to ""where the action is"". That place is Kelsey's Bar,the neighborhood pub in the Bunkers' and Stivics' hometown of Queens. Archie had been laid off from his job as a loading dock foreman and invites a Hispanic woman named Teresa Betancourt(Liz Torres,recurringly) to rent one of the bedrooms in the Bunker home(Gloria and Mike previously slept in that bedroom,she also used it as a growing-up child) for income. I also mentioned incorrectly in the season 5 set that Archie has his own chair in the Stivics' home like he has in his own house. We see Edith in the Stivics' home for the first time since she bid adieu to Louise Jefferson just before her big move to Manhattan with her husband George and their son Lionel during season 5,bringing on the premiere of The Jeffersons. I don't think we saw Archie in that house previously,but we saw him standing outside it in a season 1 episode talking to former resident Jim Bowman(the late pre-Frank Lorenzo Vincent Gardenia). The other episodes are great. This CBS sitcom was still in the Top 10 in 1975-76 along with The Jeffersons,AITF's ""grandchild"" Good Times and two other CBS sitcoms,M*A*S*H and Rhoda(spinoff of The Mary Tyler Moore Show). I dedicate this item to the memory of O'Connor(August 2,1924-June 21,2001).",1165363200,12,2348,5.054123711340206
2697924,5,B000KX0IPY,"Wow, they can actuality count to six as in the ""SIXTH SEASON"" Why I thought maybe they just couldn't count that high LOL.

Fans, keep ordering these DVD's as they become available to show that we really do want the ENTIRE collection.",1164931200,4,288,4.39622641509434
2697926,5,B000KX0IPY,"Hooray!  It had been almost a year since Season Five was released, with no sign of Season Six on the horizon...until now!  I'm giving this title a five-star rating despite the fact that I know it will be plagued with picture imperfections and will almost certainly contain no extras.  Why?  Because this release, despite those minor frustrations, will afford me the opportunity to view yet another season of this classic show in the original CBS broadcast versions, as opposed to the horrendously butchered reruns shown on TV Land!

It's getting exciting now, since we're getting closer to the end.  With each additional season, the chances of getting the rest of the show released keep getting better and better.  Please be sure to support this season, as doing so will let Sony Home Entertainment know that we want ALL of the seasons on DVD!",1164499200,23,843,4.853146853146853

2698039,5,B000KX0IPY,Good price for one of the classic TV shows.  I love having these DVD's form the early years.  Good stuff,1379635200,,104,4.15
2698040,5,B000KX0IPY,"I became an ""All in the Family"" fan in January 1971 when its first episode aired as a midseason replacement. For nine years I watched every episode, re-watched them during the summer, watched them yet again when the reruns hit daytime TV, and finally bought the DVDs when they were issued. Needless to say, I think it's one of the greatest comedy shows of all times.

Season 6 was a transitional season. The Jeffersons were gone, having moved to their luxury apartment in Manhattan. However, they still owned the house next to the Bunkers, and gave Mike and Gloria a sweetheart deal so that they could move in. With the Stivics out of the Bunker house more episodes concentrated exclusively on Archie and Edith. However, Mike and Gloria continued to appear in many of the episodes. This includes several episodes dealing with Gloria's pregnancy and the eventual birth of little Joey.

It also includes an episode that I find to be one of the funniest of all times. Archie gives CPR to a woman who passes out in the back of his car. Or at least he thinks it's a woman. Upon arriving at the Bunker house to give Archie a reward, the person tells Edith that he is a ""female impersonator."" Edith gets a baffled look on her face and says, ""Who better to impersonate a female than another woman,"" to which the female impersonator responds, ""I don't think you understand, Mrs. Bunker. I'm a transvestite."" Edith, who obviously has no idea what this means, responds, ""Oh. Well, you don't have an accent."" The dialog gets even more hilarious when Archie arrives in the room, convinced that the impersonator is really a woman, until he pulls off his wig and reveals a nearly bald head.",1375401600,,1675,4.655405405405405
2698041,5,B000KX0IPY,"This season includes the transvestite episode, which is one of my favorite!  The show has no bad seasons, it's probably the best sitcom of all time!",1369094400,,148,4.6923076923076925
2698042,5,B000KX0IPY,"One of the few shows that actually maintained and got funnier as it progressed. We enjoy all the seasons of ""All in the Family"" and no collection would be complete without season 6.

2698083,5,B000KX0IPY,If you love the old shows this one is for you.  All in the family was a first for it's time and the characters are likeable and heartwarming - even Archie at times.  Recommend the whole set.,1308182400,,190,4.108108108108108
2698084,3,B000KX0IPY,"This was probably one of the biggest hurdles to this series. (At least until Michael and Gloria moved away after season 8.) During season 5, the Jefforsons moved away and Michael and Gloria moved next door. To be sure, Irene Lorenzo stayed for a few more episdoes. And Michael and Archie could still have their disputes. But they weren't immediately available anymore.

But that said, the series did seem to do well despite the new difficulties. In ""The Very Moving Day,"" we see that Gloria is going to have a child soon. In ""Alone At Last""  Michael makes a funny declaration of independence with Archie right before he realizes that he isn't quite ready to move.

""Archie the Hero"" is a funny story. Archie thinks he has saved a woman's life with 'mouth to mouth,' but he soon finds he has saved the life of a female impersonator. (Beverly would return in Season 7's ""Beverly Rides Again,"" and then have a tragic end in Season 8's ""Edith's Crisis of Faith."")

""Chain Letter"" is a funny episdoe where Archie thinks he is cursed because he failed to send on a chain letter from Irene.

""Gloria Is Nervous"" is cute. We might find ourselves on Michael's side when he isn't too anxious to attend a baby shower taking photos of 'preppy pregos.' Saint Irene comes to the rescue.

Later Gloria has her son Joey.

""Archie Finds a Friend"" is somewhat of a sad episdoe. ""Archie's Weighty Problem"" shows us the pains of dieting.

A real gem is ""Joey's Baptism."" Atheist Michael doesn't want to baptize his son, and Archie takes it upon himself. He may be going against Michael's wishes, but somehow, we get the impression that the writer wants us on Archie's side.

Perhaps the best episdoe is ""Gloria and Mike's Guests."" Due to a broken furnace, Archie and Edith have to spend the night at Michael and Gloria's. And Michael gets a huge taste of the trials he had put Archie through for 5 years.

This series proved that even after losing the Jeffersons, after Michael and Gloria moving next door, and Irene appearing only now and then, ""All In the Family"" was still running strong.

2698086,5,B000KX0IPY,"The 1975-1976 TV season would be ""All in the Family's"" last year as the highest rated series on American network televison, culminating five years at the top. The sixth year was a good one: the acting remained strong and vibrant, and the scripts were first-rate. The bulk of the season dealt with Gloria and Mike becoming first-time parents making Archie and Edith grandparents. It's a fun year from the first episode when we learn Gloria is pregnant to the two parter that deals with the delivery of little Joey.

 This year would also be the first not to feature Jean Stapleton in a few shows and her absence is noticeable; when you watch these few shows, sans Edith, you realize how important Edith was to the canvas of the series. Billy Crystal also has an appearance in one of the episodes, but for me the highlight of the season is the show called ""Archie, the Hero"" where Archie states to the family he gave CPR to a woman in the cab he was driving. However, the woman turned out to be a transvestite!

Family Guy and the Simpsons try to use the same format, but they are just not as good as the old fashion All In the Family even though they are more successful financially and have younger generations relate to them.

""All in the Family"" is brave, honest, funny and sad at times as well.  I've passed my love of ""All in the Family"" on to my children and co-workers.  I highly recommend Season 6 of ""All in the Family""; don't hesitate to purchase and watch the first 5 seasons as well.

2698124,4,B000KX0IPY,"Another great season after another. Is there a better show than this?  Think of the time when the series ran Back in the 70's.  Just seven years earlier the show's were ""Leave it to Beaver""  ""Andy Griffith"" and ""The Lucy Show"" .  All are funny and clean cut humor.  But nothing like ""All in the Family"".  The acting And expressions are simply great. The only reason this dvd is not getting 5 stars is because the first disc produces a very slight clicking noise about every 2-3 seconds.  Must be from the transfer or something.  I Just wish they would release these seasons more often. Why the wait?!  The show is totally dated but at the time people did have these connections with these characters.  The black and white episodes of Andy Griffith are timeless in a sense that the show doesn't focus on any real event of the day, just good ol' Barney and Andy shootin' the breeze in the court house.

I know that I did not start collecting these DVDs just to be left with an incomplete set.  There isn't even any talk about a future release date, no news at all.  What IS the problem? I think this is a digrace and I'm pretty much done with Sony.  Customer satisfaction is obviously not a priority.",1208131200,20,605,4.366071428571429
2698126,4,B000KX0IPY,"Okay, when I bought this, I cared only for the episode ""Mike's Move"" (which makes a terrific reversal of opinions between Mike and Archie) and the season opener (which tries to explain how Mike, against bringing in children because of the world's problems).

The series itself continues the road down ""trying to be a typical family drama/sitcom"" by dwelling more on the characters' personal lives than topical situations (for the 1970s), though the highlight episodes of this season definitely remind us that All in the Family hasn't quite jumped yet.

And there's no better way to become a typical sitcom drama by introducing a baby into the mix.  Normally, this stock fodder becomes ""jump the shark"" fodder, but in AitF's case, the producers remembered the show's roots and provided some riveting commentary while also trying to compete with ""Days of Our Lives"".

While it's true the 6th season is the most variable yet, there are still a handful of strong episodes - thanks to AitF's original premise of discussing society's problems and foibles:

* The Very Moving Day -- Gloria tells all she's pregnant season opener - Mike is ambivalent and the results are both funny and thought-provoking
* Mike Faces Life -- Gloria is fired because she is pregnant
* The Little Atheist -- Archie wants the baby to be Christian; Mike wants to let the baby decide what to believe in when it grows up and can decide for itself
* Archie's Civil Rights -- Archie is mugged but is the one in trouble because of how he defended himself
* Mike's Move -- Mike's own believes are put to the test when he's pitted against an African-American for a job opening (best ep. of season 6)
* ""Archie's Weighty Problem"" - Archie has to lose weight, or else...  the family helps, but our ""liberal"" Mike sees fit to be a real donkey and eat chips in front of the guy anyway...

Of course, not all is well in Bunkerville:

* Gloria Suspects Mike (a reversal of a season 2 story; only this time it's Gloria who thinks Mike is cheating.  Re-using old plots is clearly shark bait.)
* New Year's Wedding (Mike summarily makes decisions -- a bit contrived to making its case.  It seems more a piece on pop-culture psychobabble than anything else.)
* ""Love By Appointment"" (Mike and Gloria have no time to get jiggy; and Mike accuses Gloria that their son will end up suffering from ""Momism"" because she's always there and he is not.  Note:  1970s psychology was often anti-female.  Was there ever a ""Dadism"" as there are women who partner rather than marry too...)
* ""Gloria and Mike's Houseguest"" (Archie and Mike, forced together - again.)

The other episodes are ""average"" when the day is said and done.

All in all, this is a good season, but it's also clear the sharks are hungry as the opening credits were sung faster by Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton, with the removal of the episode epilogues.  (Could the latter be due to syndication cuts?)

Video and audio quality are what can be expected when cramming a high number of episodes onto one disc; never mind the quality of the source video tape.  All the money in the world could only do so much...

Definitely worth a rent, if not purchase, but from here on out expect the topical stories to get more watered down; the ""sweeps week"" episodes being more character-driven than societal-observation -- the latter of which was how this series became popular in the first place.",1203033600,,3403,4.698653198653199
2698127,3,B000KX0IPY,"Short and to the point: Season six of ALL IN THE FAMILY is still better than any other show at the time (sit-com), but this season ranks poorly in my opinion to the classic first five seasons of the show.
Don't get me wrong; It's still the greatest show of all time in my book, but i like season seven better thatn season six.
Season six has too many episodes that center at Mike and Gloria's house, and it just isn't the same.
Not enough Archie.
There were still great episodes in this season and many more to come in following seasons, but this is I believe the last year the show ranked at number one in the ratings, and just by benefit of pedigree at this point.
It certainly doesn't rank with the previous number 1 ranking seasons.",1198454400,4,736,4.302158273381295

2698168,5,B000KX0IPY,"One notices in this season that there are a lot of zooms, close-ups, and different camera angles that weren't present in the previous seasons.  This, in my opinion, gives the sitcom too much of a ""dramatic"" feel, rather than the good-old fashoned wide-angle shots that were used predominantly before.  In the episode ""Archie Finds A Friend"", there's actually a close-up scene where Mr. Bernstein lies there dying; and as the camera zooms up to Archie, you see all this sweat running down his chest.  Yuck!  All that new camerawork just gives AAF a totally different feel to me from the other seasons.

Nevertheless, it is All In the Family, and the priceless lines from Archie make it still worthy of 5 stars.",1185840000,,709,4.778688524590164

Not only that but why would they release Season 1 of ""Archie Bunker's Place"" before the rest of the ""All In The Family"" series is released? ""Archie Bunker's Place"" is more or less a continuation of ""All in the Family"". I don't get it. I remember when the first Twilight Zone DVDs started coming out. They released the first 12, then all of a sudden they stopped production. It took something like five or six years before they resuemed production. After buying them though, I found the reason: The first 12 DVDs were released by Panansonic and apparently they lost the release rights until another company, ""IMAGE"" bought the rights and started production. Who knows, maybe Michael Jackson bought up the rights to ""All in the Family"" the way he did the Beatle's master tapes, in which case, we'll never see them released.",1178755200,2,870,4.69281045751634

2698176,5,B000KX0IPY,"The show, in my opinion, is the best all-time show ever for American TV. (You know it was based on a British TV show called ""Til Death us Do Part."") My husband who was raised in Britain absolutely howls with laughter at Archie Bunker. I introduced him to the show when Carroll O'Connor died in 2001 (I think). He also thinks Edith is a wonderful character. The show just reminds me of my grandmother's house in the 70s. The fabric calendar on the wall of the kitchen, the furniture, the colors, etc. What Gloria wouldn't have done with a good straightening iron for her hair like we have today.
As always the show is peppered with Archie's mispronunciations: one good one is his saying ""menstrual"" instead of ""minstral"" for which Edith must translate for the listener.

2698196,5,B000KX0IPY,"NBC loves to hang the moniker ""greatest ____ ever"" on its TV shows as if saying so makes it so. First, The Cosby Show was the greatest sitcom ever, then Seinfeld, then Friends. Of course, according to NBC, ER is the greatest program in the history of television, so we all have to discuss comedy programs in and of themselves. If NBC spent nearly as much time creating good new shows as it does in shamelessly overhyping their old shows, they probably would still be ahead of CBS in the ratings.

For my money, no sitcom will ever top the great All in the Family in any respect -- acting, writing and overall influence. To get an idea of what dire straits TV comedy was in before All in the Family, take a look at an episode of one of the other sitcoms that was on the air at the time: Family Affair, The Brady Bunch, the last, sad days of Bewitched, The Beverly Hillbillies. The country had grown up, but television sitcoms had stayed rooted in the same dated themes of the 1950's and 1960's: either sterilized white bread families or gimmicky hocus pocus that took the place of the quality writing of classics like I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and The Dick Van Dyke Show. Subjects like Vietnam, flower children, drugs, poverty, racism, homosexuality and rape were taboos.

Enter Archie, Edith, Mike and Gloria who dealt with all those issues and more head on in every episode. While Carol Brady scolded her children for saying the word ""stinker,"" Archie Bunker held a lengthy dissertation on the phrase ""god damn it."" While Samantha Stevens was still dealing with her wacky witch and morlock relatives, the Bunkers were coming face to face with a transsexual. While the perpetually backwards residents of The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction and Green Acres discussed barn dances and pig raising, the Bunkers talked about the bombing of Cambodia and Watergate.

To be sure, Archie Bunker was a caricature -- a personification of all the old time, outdated prejudiced values that were so out of step in the early 70's. Creator Norman Lear's political perspective is cleary on the side of Mike and Gloria Stivic rather than Archie or Edith. However, Lear, who modeled the character of Archie on his father, wisely gave Archie Bunker a good soul. It's clear that deep down, Archie is a good person who can't deal with the changes in his life and the country without lashing out angrily at them.

The supreme achievement of All in the Family is that it takes all that anger and controversy and makes them funny. In the episode where the Jeffersons move into the neighborhood, for example, Archie's bigoted opposition to letting a black family could have made the situation ugly and very, very unfunny. However, Archie's opposition and fear is lampooned, making the point that discriminating on the basis of race is ridiculous. It's certainly deeper and more meaningful than Soup Nazis or finding out which two members of the Friends ensemble will sleep with each other next.

In addition, the cast is probably the best ever assembled for sitcom with the possible exceptions of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Carroll O'Connor as Archie, Jean Stapleton as Edith, Rob Reiner as Mike Stivic and Sally Struthers as Gloria are absolute magic together and still manage to convey how much they love each other even while they argue about and disagree about everything. In addition, the supporting cast would later include so many great actors and actresses as so many great characters that All in the Family would spawn five spinoffs. A true measure of how much the characters come to mean to the audience is in the episode ""Gloria's Pregnancy."" When Gloria miscarries, Archie goes to comfort her. Even though he can't find the right words to say, the look that passes between Archie and Gloria is extremely moving and touching. The characters yell and scream the most horrible things at each other, but when push comes to shove, they are a real, loving family.

No matter how much NBC and other networks may hype their sitcoms as being the best ever, All in the Family will always be king. The show made television grow up and meet the issues of the day head on while still making the audience laugh and care.",1167350400,55,4231,4.741847826086956
