6701782,1,B00O20UTH8,"As the parent of an adopted child with severe reactive attachment disorder (RAD), I certainly could relate to many parts of this film. I was surprised, therefore, when the film left me feeling more than a little disturbed. I did not expect to feel that way, and it took me some time to put my finger on the reasons for my discomfort. First, the film ends on an overly optimistic note. This film followed the family only as long as my child's ""honeymoon period"" lasted. After the honeymoon ended, the behaviors became increasingly troublesome. Second, this film provides the same message that our adoption agency provided - that is, RAD can be fixed. Yes, in some cases it can, but no one talks about the cases in which every feasible intervention fails. And speaking of feasible interventions, it seemed to me this film was holding out hope for adoptive families, but only those few who can afford to have top-notch development psychologists camp out in their home, film every interaction between and among family members, and provide instant, play-by-play feedback to the parents. If I had a two-hour commute to work and someone said they knew how I could cut it to 15 minutes, I would be very interested until they said their solution would require millions of dollars for a prototype flying car. Finally, I came to the conclusion that this film is really an infomercial for Dr. Marvin's program. It is full of teasers, leading you to believe Dr. Marvin and his colleague know how to help the parents in each situation, but stopping short of sharing that information with the audience. I would be very interested to know the motivation behind the production of this film. And Dr. Marvin, if you ever read this, I dare you to try to help my child. His problems are ten times more severe than anything portrayed in this film.",1423699200,5,1825,4.724137931034483
6701783,4,B00O20UTH8,"I loved watching it. I don't know what the adoptive parents' intentions were. I won't assume. I did think it would have helped to have a translator available to those children, even if just a short amount of time. It might have saved a lot of frustration. I don't know what I would do in those instances.",1422662400,4,304,4.350877192982456
6701784,2,B00O20UTH8,"This documentary, while attempting to address an important and worth-while consideration in the subject matter of adoption, fails miserably to engender any sympathy for the family portrayed. You're expected to feel sorry for them because of the difficulty of dealing with the emotional detritus of a childhood spent in a Russian orphanage, but the documentary is more successful in portraying the Diaz family as insipid, ignorant and selfish. Moreover, the documentary fails spectacularly in identifying some of the immediately obvious problems for the family: the language barrier. It also completely fails to acknowledge just how lucky these people are - not only to be blessed with a beautiful, healthy biological child (which many couples would give their right arm for) but also to have to significant resources required to engage in this adoption process in the first place. It made me think of a scene in ""Friends"" where Chandler rants sarcastically: ""My wallet's too small for my fifties and my diamond shoes are too tight!""

With lofty goals of creating a ""Disney Family"" of their dreams by adding 3 children at once, it apparently didn't occur to them to ""shop"" for the perfect fit in their own backyard. So, instead of adopting one of the many, many children in foster care right here in the United States, they fly halfway across the world with not so much as a Russian phrase book or having taken the time to learn even just a handful of phrases. Instead, they overwhelm Masha - the girl - with constant photo ops and requests to ""dance, puppet, dance"". You come away with the impression that they're trying to buy kids for their own entertainment and approach the whole thing as a monetary transaction - judging by their huge home, they clearly have enough cash but seriously lack in common sense.

Then, as soon as the children are in their custody, they're bombarded with instructions in English - which they of course don't understand - and constantly hugged without any consideration for the culture shock these children are experiencing or an ounce of comprehension that, obviously, a period of adjustment is necessary to give the children time to absorb the reality of their new family situation. Once at their new home in the US, the children are left unsupervised and one of the boys pretty much falls flat on his face after activating a treadmill - which, of course, he's never seen in his life. Neither parent is anywhere to be found when this is filmed, and apparently the person behind the camera thought it was more interesting to keep filming than to keep the child from hurting himself.

The couple is so ridiculously dumb and harebrained it's painful - they respond with ""yeah"" and nods when they don't understand anything the children are saying, giving you the clear impression that they made absolutely no preparations to deal with these children. There is no attempt to communicate with hand signals to bridge the gap until the children learn English, and clearly it never occurred to the Diaz family that maybe, just maybe, it would be a good idea to invest in learning the basics in a foreign language when you adopt children from that country.

Meanwhile, the biological daughter (Cami) - an only child who hungered for siblings all her life - soon loses interest in interacting with the children after it becomes clear that communication will require a labor intensive, long-term effort - while the father delights in showing off just how big and pompous their home is, instead of focusing on finding a way to interact and communicate with the children he and his wife traveled thousands of miles to bring to America. With the novelty attached to the adopted children, Cami - a self-professed daddy's girl - gets jealous and resentful of Masha. Its understandable that she feels marginalized, between a father trying to contain two rambunctious boys, a new sister and a mother who seems to be noticeably absent in most of the footage  bar those moments where she dissolves into tears because its all just SO HARD. Which any halfway intelligent human being could have told them, because thats why its so incredibly difficult to find a permanent homes for sibling groups currently in foster care all over the continental US. The mother, in particular, comes across as petulant, childish and mopey throughout the majority of the documentary.

The documentary is also threadbare on other information you would expect to round out the picture - basic things like how old the biological daughter and the parents are, how old the adopted children are etc. It fails to address the questions of why the Diaz family waited so long to adopt, why they didn't adopt from within their own community, why they chose Russian orphans - and conveniently fails to disclose the dollar signs behind this entire endeavor, which would not even be an option for many Americans.

For me, one of the saddest moments in the documentary was when Masha said she would never cry in front of anyone because she just wants everyone to think she's happy - a feeling that's reinforced by the Diaz' insistence, from day one, that she should smile all the time...without any consideration for whether or not she feels like it. What's even more egregious is when the Diaz family decides to change the given names of their adoptive children to Anglo-American ones that match with the initials of the rest of the family (in itself groan-worthy) - in what one can only assume to be a selfish attempt to assimilate and imprint on them and effort to sever any last, remaining parts of their own identities. Despite the protestations of all three children that they don't want to be renamed, a translator drills into them that this is what Mama wants and you have to listen to Mama - with the unspoken threat in the air that their feelings, opinions and personalities are no longer their own.

A perfect example of the idiocy of these adoptive parents is when the father uses some kind of gardening or lawn care equipment. The loud noises terrify one of the boys to the point of tears, which the viewer finds out is because of abuse at the hands of older boys in the orphanage that involved a vacuum cleaner. The father, ever the clueless dolt, actually states on camera that something mustve been tragic with a landscaper or something. Oh yes, I keep forgetting that Russian orphanages have landscapers  talk about a comment deserving of a head-smack.

I found myself repeatedly pausing this documentary because it was so aggravating, so irritating, quite frankly offensive on many levels. The couple keeps lamenting how difficult this all is and comes across as throwing a self-indulgent pity party for issues that arose out of their irresponsible decisions and lack of preparation. They seem to pay little to no attention to very obvious, physical clues from the children  the father effusively trying to hug and kiss them all the time, clearly without the thought that these children need time to form a bond and attachment.  The ending is a happy one, with seemingly well-adjusted children after whatever time period has elapsed  but the documentary fails for me on too many levels. I'm glad I watched it but the only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because, if nothing else, it's a good cautionary tale of what NOT to do if you want to adopt.",1421366400,19,7362,4.847255369928401
6701785,4,B00O20UTH8,"I thought this was a great introductory documentary for people who are interested in playing a role in adopting or foster parenting one day (e.g. would-be adoptive families, their friends, families, or persons interesting in supporting others in the adoption or fostering process) for two reasons.  First, it provides a good overview on some of the issues adoptive/foster families face like family dynamic issues, stress on the stay-at-home parent, attachment issues, and the different ways kids from orphans act out or struggle with various interactions.  Second, I felt it didn't gloss over the difficult aspects of adoption.  From what I've read or seen, adoption is a beautiful yet difficult uphill journey.  I appreciated the non-fairy-tale portrayal of this family's decision to expand their family through adoption.

My main disappointment in this film was that I was hoping for more information.  I was looking forward to seeing the experiences of this family through the lens of a Dr. Robert Marvin's expertise.  Personally, I was hoping for more of his interpretation and insights in many of the scenarios this family faced.  I was also a little disappointed that this film only depicted one family's experiences.  It was a case study and it was definitely eye-opening, yet I was hoping for more insights into how this family's experience related to those of other adoptive/foster families.  These are just my own personal preferences though, and I would still have watched the documentary even knowing these factors (I just wished I had known ahead of time).

As a side note to those who read the other reviews.  It seems like people are rating the film lower because of personal feelings concerning the family depicted in it.  I would just like to stress that, while I definitely disagreed with many of the family's decisions, - and yes, felt similar frustrations- I don't think it should reflect negatively on the review of the film.  The film itself is well-made, it provides a look at one family's experience adopting three orphans.  If I was to review a drama movie, I wouldn't dock the review simply because I didn't like the main characters.  Just thought that was worth mentioning.",1420502400,6,2200,5.069444444444445
6701786,3,B00O20UTH8,"The movie is interesting from purely an anthropological standpoint, and I was deeply concerned for these kids, but I found myself getting very frustrated with the family and the psychologists involved. It was a little infuriating how unprepared they were. I can't believe they were allowed to adopt three children at the same time, all with a language barrier and all from Russian orphanages. They were totally clueless. They adopted a very serious 11 year old girl named Masha and you can see in poor Masha's eyes how big and dumb these American weirdos seem when they are driving her home from the airport telling her about how every member of the family is represented by a different Disney character. And then they decided to change the kids names, including their first and middle names, so that they could keep their scheme of the whole family having matching initials, even when the kids unanimously say they do not want new first names. I wanted to slap these parents. I didn't see them making any attempt to learn Russian. And these doctors were nearly as frustrating because they constantly blamed all the problems on the poor kids and their histories instead of considering that perhaps part of the problems were due to clueless, unprepared parents.",1419638400,14,1260,4.892523364485982
6701787,4,B00O20UTH8,"You have to be a special type of person to be an adoptive parent, let alone adopting three children at once with a language barrier.  Interesting documentary.",1419465600,2,158,4.851851851851852
8681534,1,B00O20UTH8,"As a mother in a large family, this was a waste of my money. The family it follows only has one child and then adopts 3. The behaviors we saw in the film were no surprise to a mom of six and would've been handled differently. I guess it's a good show for a new family with 0 or 1 child adopting several kids at once from a foreign country.",1516320000,,339,3.857142857142857
8681535,5,B00O20UTH8,"This is a very intense movie about international adoption. It follows three children adopted from Russia before the Russian adoption ban against the United States. It shows the struggles of the family who adopted the children (the parents and the young daughter), as well as the new daughter and the twin brothers who are much younger. Definitely a must see for adoptive families where there is a lack of care in the orphanages.",1485129600,,428,4.876712328767123

8681539,3,B00O20UTH8,"The Dark Matter of Love, released in 2012, and directed by Sarah McCarthy, is a story showing the journey of three children who are adopted from Arkhangelsk, Russia, and move to Wisconsin with their new family. Claudio and Cheryl Diaz, along with their fourteen-year-old daughter Cami, finally have the chance to expand their family like they have always wanted. Eleven-year-old Masha, and five-year-old twins Marcel and Vadim come with a lot more challenges than the family originally expected. As a result of the language barrier between the children, who speak Russian, and the Diazes, who speak English, communication is hard. With the help of two developmental psychologists, the three children overcome the psychological issues they developed from living in the orphanage, and the parents learn how to help their children adjust to their new life.
A major theme the film focuses on is how it shows how children who are raised in an orphanage differ from those who were raised with parents, and why they are the person they are. With the help of a developmental psychologist, Dr. Robert Martin, their behaviors are explained.  He says, Having a relationship with one or a few very specific people is absolutely crucial to a childs developing brain. He goes on to explain how there are two patterns of behavior that appear in children who have grown up in orphanages. The first pattern is the internalization of feelings, and emotions are not expressed at all. Masha often acts this way when she is upset, and does not express her feelings until the very end of the film, when she feels comfortable enough to count on her parents. The second pattern is the exact opposite; the children throw temper tantrums over small things. Marcel and Vadim show this kind of behavior, and start to throw less tantrums as the film progresses.
  Having the psychologists explain why the children were behaving that way helps the audience to understand what the children and parents are going through. It also helps the parents to understand their children better, and how to help them. However, this can also give the film a slight reality-show feeling Tina Traster says in her review of The Dark Matter of Love. While I can see where she is coming from, when they switch back and forth from the happy family to the psychologists watching and analyzing them on a computer screen, I disagree. I think that they were helpful, and added to the film by explaining things that would have otherwise been unclear or confusing about the childrens behavior.
 The film shows the progress of everyone in the family extremely well. Cheryl, Claudio, and Cami are happy and excited to meet the members of their new family in the beginning. When everyone comes home, they are all a little unsure that it will work and overwhelmed, and Cami starts to feel left out because her parents are so busy with the new kids. But, then things start to get better, and they begin to feel like a family. Marcel and Vadim no longer throw fits, Masha joins choir, and Cami has once again found her place in their new family. Masha and Cami begin to do more than just coexist in each others lives, and really become sisters.
 Although the film shows the progress of each member of the family well, it only shows their progress to a certain extent. They show us a year of their lives, and there is no follow-up after a few years to see how they are doing, so you are left wondering how their lives are. You become invested in their lives while watching them grow as a family, but that is all you get. You only get to see a year of their lives, a little glimpse, and they have all of these years ahead of them in which anything can happen.
 Overall, this film is heart-warming and moving and proves that despite the odds stacked against you, anyone can learn to love. This family has come a long way from where it started, and still has a long way to go, but it is heading in the right direction. The Dark Matter of Love is something worth watching for anyone interested in adopting a child or interested in psychology.",1446422400,5,4075,4.6923076923076925
8681540,4,B00O20UTH8,"I find it interesting that people seem to review this documentary based solely on the ignorant yet well intentioned parents. This is only ONE family's experience, I did not feel that it was meant to represent every single adoption case ever to have happened.
The story is very interesting and an important one to be told. I hope these kids are thriving as much as their stunted beginnings in life will allow them.",1441238400,3,413,4.671232876712328
8681541,4,B00O20UTH8,"This was worth watching if you have adopted toddlers or slightly older children internationally.  It was painful to watch at times though since I could feel their struggles too personally.  Yes, in the eyes of the world, they were crazy to adopt 3 kids at once, especially with no experience prior to this.  But, they saved 3 precious orphans from growing up and graduating from those Russian orphanages!  I appreciated seeing the journey of their biological only child too.  The ending is optimistic, yes, but there is a lot of work still needed to be done for them to continue to attach into that loving home.",1430006400,,611,4.726415094339623
