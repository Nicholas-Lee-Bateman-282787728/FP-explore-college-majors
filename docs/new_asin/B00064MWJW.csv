2168019,5,B00064MWJW,"""Cry of The Snow Lion"" is a beautiful documentary of the plight of the people of Tibet before and after the Communist China invasion. It reveals that once again our government's foreign policy is driven by materialism and greed instead of democratic principle and loyalty. Highlights of the film are news clips and interviews with primary sources. This is a well  produced ""docudrama"".

2168021,5,B00064MWJW,"I knew some of Tibet's history and social ills before picking up this DVD at my local video store. So many actors and artists have made the Tibetans' persecutions known to us that it'd be almost impossible to think most Americans don't have a general understanding of their oppression.

But what most of us probably weren't aware of, is how involved the U.S. was (is) in the demise of the Tibetan way of life. Oh sure! Blame it on the West again! But seriously, think about the following:

In the 1970's, Nixon sent Kissinger on a secret mission to help form guerrilla fighters in Tibet, so that they could fight off the Chinese troops. Then, when Nixon later wanted to open up China for trade, the first thing the U.S. did was break off all connections with those same guerillas, hanging them out to dry.

Move to current day, and we have the U.S. and China in major trade relations. More than $85 billion comes into the U.S. from China. How can Tibet compete against the Almighty Dollar? The fact is, they can't.

Even though the Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize for his decision to fight the Chinese government using non-violent acts, even though Tibet is now dedicated to peace and its ""true"" inhabitants don't lift a finger when troops storm into their monestaries, even though their way of life and their heritage is being picked apart bit by bit, America (and the UN, too) turns a blind eye. $85 million; how do you compete with that?

The final message of the film is uplifting. The narrators mention that Apartheid ended in South Africa and the Berlin Wall fell (even though everyone thought neither of these two things possible). Can Tibet, likewise, be salvaged?

Pray to Buddha that they can.

Okay, enough of the political commentary. Now let's get into the filming of this documentary. It's friggin' AMAZING! The beautiful landscapes, colorful Tibetan dress, haunting musical score, and excellent editing make this a tour-de-force film. The special features on the DVD were also remarkable.

If you pick up ONE documentary this year, I'd highly recommend this one. And not solely because of its message, but because it's beautiful, too.",1106265600,96,2154,4.787061994609164

2168023,5,B00064MWJW,"Apparently it's possible to watch this film and entirely miss the point.

Did some nameless organization declare that this was genocide, or not genocide? Did 1.2 million die, or was it less? Or more? Do the Chinese have some laughable ""legal claim"" to Tibet (as pronounced by some other nameless organization)? Does somebody somewhere think that the Chinese government doesn't lie that much?

WHO CARES?

Are the Chinese brutally repressing the Tibetans and attempting to destroy their culture? Of course. How do I know? I WATCHED THE FILM. You don't even have to listen to the narration. Just watch the film clips of Tibetan monks being bullied and harassed, the temples being destroyed, the monks attesting to the Chinese methods of torture, the rows of armed Chinese soldiers who attend Tibetan religious celebrations.

But again, this misses the point.

The point is that the Tibetan culture is incredibly beautiful, complex, and spiritually advanced, and to have it destroyed is a crime against humanity. Frankly, the future of the human race depends on the culture of the Tibetan people. Where else would you find someone declaring that they don't hate their torturers, and that they have forgiven them? This movie provides a stunning counterpoint to Western culture, which is steeped in notions of deceit, revenge, and materialism.

2168024,4,B00064MWJW,"""Tibet; Cry of the Snow Lion"" is a very good documentary with a good mix of newsreel film, spectacular mountain vistas, interviews, and modern footage of the Tibetan problems.  My lone objection to the documentary was the heavy emphasis on the ""problem"" of Chinese immigration to Tibet.  I understood that the political and religious repression of Tibet has left much of modern Tibet looking less like its' former self and more like modern China.  The efforts of one of Mao's ten year plans was disasterous to the region.  However, the suggestion that the encouragement of Chinese immigration to Tibet is a means of breaking the country's political and spirtual independence was a bit narrow-minded in my opinion.

I wonder what the contributors of ""Tibet; Cry of the Snow Lion"" would have to say about the expanding Muslim population in Europe.  Would they join a small but growing chorus of those who advocate a concept of ethnic purity.  Perhaps a case could be made that the muslim rise in political and religious influence in Europe is intentional as well.  We live in a world in which populations are in flux in many areas of the world.  This selective emigration/immigration certainly is having an impact in a number of locations including the United States.  The all too frequent scenes of amusement parks in Tibet suggests that lesser people are corrupting the purity of Tibetan culture.  This documentary gives a lot of evidence in support of real repression of Tibetan culture and religion.  However, the Nazi-like call for ethnic cleansing (except for enlightened mountain climbers) struck a very sour note with me.",1264896000,,1627,5.007434944237918

2168026,1,B00064MWJW,"There's a lot wrong with this film. It is factually incorrect on both big and small claims. Since this is a short review, I'll give one salient example of a gross factual inaccuracy and some recommended readings for the truly curious and fair/open-minded student of Sino-Tibetan history.

The film makes a claim that the human rights organization ICJ (International Committee of Jurists) found that China was guilty of committing genocide and had killed ""1.2 million Tibetans."" This is the opposite of what the committee actually found. The ICJ concluded that no evidence of genocide occurred in Tibet. Now it is possible that the film was going by the accusations made by the ICJ in 1959 published in a preliminary report based only on exiles' hearsay accounts. This preliminary (pre-investigation) report was titled ""The Question of Tibet The rule of Law."" However, after an extensive one year investigation, the ICJ was forced to conclude that there was no evidence to support the exiles' claim of genocide as defined under international law. This report was titled ""Tibet and the Chinese People's Republic."" They concluded their study with:

""The COMMITTEE did not find that there was sufficient proof of the destruction of Tibetans as a race, nation or ethnic group as such by methods that can be regarded as genocide in international law."" (Legal Inquiry Committee, ""Tibet and the Chinese People's Republic, Geneva ICJ"")

No good documentary film-maker, who truly is candidly invested in finding the truth would confuse preliminary accusations with the actual findings. That's like accusing someone of a crime based on what the prosecutor had said at his trial when he had already been legally exonerated by the jury. That is incompetent journalism at best and downright slanderous at worst.

Also, regarding the genocide accusations, see what the former director for the Free Tibet Campaign in London, Patrick French had to say about the pro-Tibet organizations' claims of genocide and the 1.2 million figure:

""These groups hate criticism almost as much as the Chinese government does. Some use questionable information. For example, the Free Tibet Campaign in London (of which I am a former director) and other groups have long claimed that 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed by the Chinese since they invaded in 1950. However...while researching my book on Tibet, I found that there was no evidence to support that figure.""

You can read his article at:[...].

Ironically, many of the experts in the film had written books demolishing the claims within it! For example, A Tom Grunfeld's excellent book ""The Making of Modern Tibet,"" (devoting a large portion of one chapter) explicitly refutes claims of genocide.

Grunfeld's book also claims that Tibet had gained tremendously by way of standard of living post Chinese takeover and that China did have a sufficient legal claim over Tibet under international law. Other factors culminating in the communist decision for a takeover of Tibet involved complex realpolitic maneuvering between the west and China over control of the strategically valuable central Asian region. Western (and especially CIA) skullduggery during that period in Asia and its ultimate tragic consequences for Tibetans had largely been forgotten but is amply documented by Grunfeld and other historians and tibetologists but completely ignored in this film. Given the historical facts, it is understandable why it was inevitable that China would takeover Tibet. This film does not offer a balanced view of that (more complex and accurate) perspective.

Moreover, in an interesting passage, Grunfeld also says that in the propaganda wars between the pro-Tibet side and the Chinese side, the Chinese side had ""fabricated less.""

The Tibet-China issue is very complex. I don't doubt great tragedies happened in Tibet as a result of communist brutality and incompetence. But in our culture, we tend to only listen to things condensed into sound-bite-sized pieces and to view things only as black/white or evil/good. It's easy to sip lattes, and shout slogans but to be truly informed about a complicated situation, we may have to get passed the superficiality and actually pick up a book! I recommend, besides the Grunfeld book, Melvyn Goldstein's ""The Snow Lion and the Dragon"" and Barry Sautman's ""Contemporary Tibet.""",1215216000,14,4351,5.265512265512266

Due to the subject matter, this film a definite downer.  My major gripe about it, is that it tells the viewer nothing of what's being done to help the situation.

2168032,5,B00064MWJW,"This beautiful film captures the mystery of Tibetan Buddhism in a way that we of the West can begin to understand. I brought a lot of background knowledge to the subject, but through this film came to understand the place of the monasteries in Tibetan life in a new way. Tibet has no educational system apart from the monasteries; when one reads that 10% of the population consisted of monks and nuns, it's easier to understand if you think of these individuals as involved in cultural and scholarly as well as religious pursuits. In the west these are sharply divided spheres; not so in the east.

The film is astounding in its breadth of material, from what must have been clandestine films of riots and beatings to Chinese military training films. There are numerous interviews of monks and nuns who must no longer be in Tibet. And the pictures of modern Tibet are heartbreaking, especially of the mighty Potala Palace with Chinese kids' rides and fast food vendors cluttering the plaza below. This is how the Chinese have really destroyed the culture; a new rail line to Tibet is imminent, and masses of Chinese are flooding the country, marginalizing the Tibetans and bringing with them the most tawdry aspects of what was once a proud and ancient culture in its own right.

The film makes the point that the Chinese have suffered too. One would think that Tibet could have been left as a peaceful buffer for China from India but that's not the Chinese Communist way. Of course the film is pro-Tibetan, but as usual the history is a bit more complicated. In fact Tibet has always had very close cultural ties with China, and there were Tibetans who encouraged the Chinese. Indeed, the Dalai Lama's predecessor for many years was a stooge of the Chinese. Tibet could not exist in a world of superpowers, but that inescapable fact doesn't lessen the tragedy this film portrays.",1179705600,6,1880,4.746177370030581

I felt very ignorant of world affairs as I watched, but was happy to be enlightened by the film. Tibet is so beautiful, yet holds a very dark history as people unfold the truth about the suffering and religious persecution. It is unbelievable that many are not bitter or angry toward the ones who tortured them or killed their friends and family, and they still hold hope that one day Tibet will be free. One can't help but tangle with a mix of emotions after watching the chronicle of events surrounding the 'rooftop of the world'. It is my personal hope that the native people of Tibet regain their freedom.

I'm not unfamiliar with the issues of Tibet, but there is much I did not know - including the beauty of the place, and the sadness of what we have to lose if the genocide taking place there succeeds.

The documentary itself, narrated by Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and many others, is rich with history and detail. The special features are just as powerful, with the scenes captured with no narration, so that you get the richness of the Tibetan laughter as they milk the cows, herd the donkeys and do some amazing pony riding.

2168040,2,B00064MWJW,"As a frequent visitor to the Himalayas and being closely in touch with both Tibetans (ordinary folks, not the tortured ones) and the Chinese, I find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided.

A Nepalese friend of mine has this to say: ""When they first came here as refugees, they were truly destitute. We pitied them and donated generously. Every time they cried ""Free Tibet!"", donations poured in from all over the world. Isn't it ironic that these former refugees now have more privileges and better opportunities than the average Nepalese? Do they really want to abandon their lucrative businesses here and go back? Or do they just want more support and donations? Free Tibet my foot.""

Yes, I too have not met a single wealthy Tibetan in Nepal or India, who can swear to me that he will return to a freed Tibet, run by their government in exile. In fact, when Nepal was mired by the Maoist insurgency, some of them actually returned to Chinese-run Tibet. Money talks. There are greedy Chinese people, greedy Americans and greedy Tibetans as well.

To be fair to the ""experts"", a lot of the evidence of Chinese violence against the Tibetans is real. I sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated. However, the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in Tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of Chinese aggression.

While it is true that many Tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time, it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries. Were there no looters, vandals, infighting? Was Tibet not a feudal state where peasants had no rights and monks abused their authority? Tibetans in the documentary who claimed that everything was lovely before the Chinese invaded were simply not telling the whole truth.

It's also incredibly naive to assume that all Tibetans think the same. Even Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile is not without opposition, violence and even assasination. While I do think that most Tibetans are good Buddhists and nice people, the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the Chinese and everything saintly with the Tibetans. This is something I find totally unacceptable. There are compassionate Tibetans. There are those who snatch torches from athletes on wheelchairs. There are violent Tibetans who loot and plunder, there are Han Chinese people who are good Tibetan Buddhists. The world isn't as simple as that depicted by the makers of this film.

A few snapshots of Tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing. There are many times more enterprising Tibetans who are now very happy with the booming economy. The documentary seems only able to find Tibetans who are against Chinese rule. They paint the picture that nobody in Tibet is happy. This is patently untrue. But then, this sort of thing sells in America. You have to have a demon, you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero (America in this case). Otherwise, it just won't sell. It's not about compassion at all.

If you really want to be ""illuminated"", visit Tibet and Tibetan communities all over China and see things for yourself. That would be far more enlightening. Sadly, many journalists prefer to interview the wrong (right?) people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent.

Finally, you can YouTube ""Eingma - Ji Siang San Bao"". A Mongolian hit from Chinese-controlled Mongolia that dominated the airwaves in downtown Beijing. Check out Dicovery Channel's Mongolian Idol for the whole story. The Chinese government does have a policy of stamping out any violent protest by any means, but it no longer has the policy of systematically destroying minority cultures. Quite the opposite in fact.

Also check out video clips of the Olymnpic torch being brought up to the summit of Everest by Tibetan climbers. Real, current and conflicting footage showing the activists and experts to be the liars are far more abundant than those disputing what the Chinese authorities have said.

Sadly, most of the people who gravitate towards these pages are already sold on the simplistic Sharon Stone idea that the Chinese are evil and the Tibetans do nothing but suffer under them. The reviewer who says something negative not only has to write the review, he has to convince and convert a lot of brainwashed people that the film they like is not an accurate depiction of the reality on the ground. Nevertheless, democracy rules and the majority is right even when it is wrong.

2168041,5,B00064MWJW,"The great interest of general public in Tibet, expecially from the American point of view, can be dated to the end of the 1980's, when after Nixon's opening to Chinese commerce, Tibet was abandoned to it's tragic destiny by the world's most influential countries. American intellectuals and artists at that moment realized that only publicity and campaigns to stimulate public opinion could help this non belligerant nation to regain its country. In the 1990's, from 1994 to 1997, three Hollywood megaproductions were issued (Little Buddha, Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet). These three movies had great success, sometimes more in the rest of the world than in the USA, but each of them in its own way gave a distorted picture of Tibetan reality from the 1950's up to now.

Somehow James Hilton's vision of Tibet described in the Last Horizon was still working in the subconscious mind of directors such as Bertolucci, Scorsese and Annaud. In the recent years many criticisms have been expressed on this kind of outlook on Tibet and finally also Hollywood has decided to diffuse a well made, educational, modern documentary on Tibet.

The Cry of the Snow Lion is a very rich visual document because interviews with tortured monks and nuns, exiled tibetans, and world specialists on tibetan issues (see John Avedon for example) are interspaced with inserts on Tibetan history and culture.

All the ""pieces"" are contextualized by a narrating voice that explains and links together the whole documentary.

Facts and figures are meticulously reported: the number of dead, the causes direct and indirect of the happenings, the quantity of the monastaries destroyed and how many Han chinese have immigrated to the country. Rare material is also reported and photographs of the 1950's in their seppia colours and are commented on. I found the interviews particularly interesting, expecially those with protagonists of the period of Chinese invasion, such as Frost and those with modern political commentators.

Naturally, as in most documents of this type, the underlying propaganda is evident, but not fastidious. The sensation one gets at the end is of a 360 outlook on this country and the point where the Tibetan issue is now standing.

I reccomend the vision of the Cry of the Snow Lion to all people over the world, interested in modern history.

All countries and people are important, but Tibet's plight is especially poignant: the location of Tibet high in the mountains between China and India, the use of torture by the Chinese, the sell out of US help to Tibet after Nixon ""went to China"", the images of US politicians shaking hands and smiling with Mao (the biggest mass murderer in the world), and now the huge US trade deficit with China that is funding all this.  The images and mechanics of how Tibetans are being marginalized and made into an underclass is evocative of all people who are in this situation.  We don't always know how they got that way, but this film shows how Tibetans are moving in that direction.

The fact that Tibet had evolved from a warrior nation to one that spent most of their resources on spiritual enlightenment makes this story relevent to all.  The Chinese destroyed over 6000 monastaries and ban the study of Tibetan culture.  I hope I live to see the Dalai Lama back in Tibet.  If not the current one, then hopefully the Chinese will let the new one out of prison.  That was one aspect of the Tibet story I did not know--the Chinese have take the six year old chosen by the current Dalai Lama to be the next Dalai Lama into detention and chose another six year old to be the next Dalai Lama--bizarre.

I just read my child the book ""Our Journey from Tibet: Based on a True Story"" about a Tibetan family of children who escaped to Dharamsala, India in order to have a Tibetan education and this film followed that story exactly.

The people's lives before and then after Communism show a stark difference and a harsh reality which affects us all... a very good film.",1418774400,2,488,4.620689655172414
8038531,5,B00064MWJW,A powerful film that is difficult for me to watch but I am grateful to have the awareness of what this film portrays. The disc arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.,1385683200,,176,4.205882352941177
8038532,5,B00064MWJW,"I bought this for two reasons. I am Buddhist, and I am researching a book that I am writing. I saw it first on Hulu I think, but instantly bought it when I realized that this was hard core information central to the issue of the Chinese occupation of Tibet. The first person stories make this priceless as solid information.

This is a documentary, not a feature film. If you are looking for entertainment, this is not it. If you are looking for enlightenment, it probably is.  Cry of the Snow Lion paints a very grim picture of freedom lost and cultural genocide, harsh occupation devoid of justice. Still, it is about people that remain unbroken.

If you have a soul, if the plight of humanity matters to you, if the truth means more to you than happiness or pleasure, this is a worthy purchase. If all you are looking at for is to be amused, then pass it by. If you did not understand compassion and suffering, before you watch this, you will afterwards.",1378252800,3,957,4.457142857142857
8038533,4,B00064MWJW,fine movie ... painful to watch because i keep up daily with what is happening to the tibetans in their land as a result of the chinese takeover and severe abuse.,1362355200,,162,4.258064516129032
8038534,5,B00064MWJW,"Few people even know where Tibet is and certainly do not know of the deep and long lasting world tragedy that happened and is happening there.  Thus, any exposure of any bits of truth about Tibet since the 1950s is vitally important.  China's military over ran Tibet then, occupied it then and now, and has a record of brutality there equal any to Khan.  The magnitude of crimes against humanity there is so huge that, to ignore it all, is to condemn the world to charges of cooperation.

However, Tibetan Buddhism, which is being crushed in the most horrible ways possible by the Red Chinese, and this sacred place of its residence was and is despoiled and desecrated near to extinction.  By Tibetan Buddhist beliefs, such horror will result in centuries of horrid karma coming to Red China.  Some see the choking air of their cities as an early sign.  When the sacred is beaten out of existence, the whole world loses.

The occupation by Red China has had the result of chasing Buddhism into the larger world.  That can be only to the good for all because Tibetan Buddhism is the conscience of mankind.  Any work that spreads this word is valuable.",1359158400,2,1150,4.620689655172414
8038535,5,B00064MWJW,"Watched this 2 times, both were eye opening.

Highly recommend this if you are wanting to learn about Tibet.  The region, religion, culture, identity, The people, One Nation under Chinese brutality.",1321747200,,198,5.354838709677419
