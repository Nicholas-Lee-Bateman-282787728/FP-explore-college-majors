8616869,5,B00FM8ECTA,"Here is an honest look at a soul that followed her heart. They say the longest distance is from the head to the heart. Aimee Semple was a model of courage. She used her head to follow her heart. She took chances , braved the naysayers and loved God and people passionately. All pioneers in this world need to take huge leaps of faith in order to be possitioned in this world to do great good, which she did. Faith is everything. She showed us thst. Faith starts us out on our visionary journeys , inspires others along the way and brings others with us to the end glory. I loved  the direction in the film. I liked the progression of Aimee's character as portrayed by Mimi , the lead. I liked her. She has both star qualities -a true spiritual light and physucal beauty , which at times seemed even angelic. I seemed to feel a genuine realness in the actress. I felt her drive, her lonlieness, her weakness and her great faith in Christ. I rooted for her and related to a lot of the spiritual dialogue in the script. I also loved the emotional relationship's power between mother, father and child. Great acting there. It was a much needed film. Thank God for the real Aimee and the souls she brought to Christ. This film will bring many in a position to reach out to God too. Thanks to  director Rossi, we can have this great memory of this most bold woman of faith.",1410566400,,1367,4.315175097276264
8616870,5,B00FM8ECTA,"Both of these titles are filled with information about the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, a person who dedicated her life to helping others. She would spend many hours preparing each sermon, she knew that what she did would have an impact on many lives. She was an Iconic individual while she was alive and now that she has gone to be with the Lord she is even more so. To this day her 4 Square churches are steadily ministering to people on a daily basis. She touched the imagination of a generation thru her ministry, many went on to become important people of their day. She was a gift to those she helped and for many whose lives were down-trodden she helped them to rise up and carry on! She was and still is an inspiration even though controversies surrounded her! She was triumphant in the Lord whom she served!",1381190400,,819,4.430463576158941
8616871,5,B00FM8ECTA,"When first introduced to Aimee Semple McPherson through the internet, by accident at that, I felt as if I had found a treasure that God himself wanted me to discover. I was fascinated by her story because of my own love for God, ministry, and the arts, so to happen upon SISTER AIMEE was a tremendous blessing to me. Richard Rossi's interpretation of this controversial woman, desirous of her God, passionate for His people, yet dealing with the complex emotions of being a woman and desiring to be loved, is a moving, and delicate piece of art.  I loved seeing the visual of her ""humanness"" in her relationships with God, family, friends, and lovers (husbands and ""assumed""). Although not a ""high budget"" Hollywood release, Rossi makes the most of his resources and talent (his, and his cast and crew).  The picture is very stylized making use of close-ups, flashbacks, and creative (and beautiful) cinematography.",1380931200,,915,4.935064935064935
8616872,5,B00FM8ECTA,"As the director of these two films (together in this Anniversary Edition in 2013 for the first time), I wanted to share that I was offered money to make a big budget film on Sister Aimee by rigid religious Aimee adherents and loyalists who offered me millions but the money had strings attached.  They wanted me to remove from my documentary ""Saving Sister Aimee"" (2001) as well as my later dramatic feature film ""Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story"" (2008) anything that could be construed as negative: (her overdose, breakdown, three marriages, and morals trial.)  I took a class in the history of the Foursquare Church through Aimee's LIFE Bible College and was stunned that her trials and many of the headline stories about her were ignored.  I couldn't live with myself if I made a propaganda piece. Jesus said the truth shall set us free, so I decided to turn down the money.  We shot both ""Saving Sister Aimee"" and ""Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story"" on a micro-budget of a few thousand dollars, but this brought out creativity in us.

I'm very proud of the cast in ""Sister Aimee,"" (2008) every one of them did an amazing job acting. The dramatic feature ""Sister Aimee' was a finalist for best feature at a film festival in Milan, and we were voted the greatest guerrilla film of all time on the IGFA top 100 list.  ""Sister Aimee"" set an attendance record at the Beverly Cinema in Hollywood (now owned by Quentin Tarentino), and we were honored at SAG with a special screening that sold out within hours.

The documentary ""Saving Sister Aimee"" (2001) won the Angel Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council. This was the first film I ever made and we finished it despite overwhelming odds, my paying the price of pouring all my time, money, and energy into finishing the film, & some powerful people threatening me if I finished & exhibited the film. I was humbled that this movie was in the Academy Award competition for Best Short Documentary. I loved the opportunity to meet and interview Sister Aimee's daughter and close compatriots for this film. My editor Jaime Prater did an amazing job assembling this documentary.

Thank you to all of you who purchase the films and have supported us. I believe in our film, in our fans, our amazing crew, and in our fantastic company of actors, so I vote ***** Five stars out of Five!  I'm not being presumptive or saying the film was perfect, because we did the best we could with what we had in terms of budget limitations.  My vote is to thank and acknowledge the great acting of Mimi Michaels, Rance Howard, Teres Byrne, Charles Hoyes, Kiera Chaplin, Etienne Eckert, Charles Gorgano, Chad Nadolski, Michael Minor, Laurie Shaw and the rest of the cast.  Thanks as well for the donation of equipment and and camera work by Jeff Griffith, editing by Jaime Prater and Adam Lightplay, and so many more who gave their heart and soul like Connie Fleishauer who did so many things.  I couldn't have done it without all the wonderful people praying and supporting and giving their time and talent and treasure.
