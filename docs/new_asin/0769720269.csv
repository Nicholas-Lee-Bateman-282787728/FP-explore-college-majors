7795798,5,0769720269,"What could be more of a stellar duo than  Baryshnikov as principal dancer and Baryshnikov as choreographer?  An absolutely enthralling ballet with beautiful costuming, well-appointed sets,  and outstanding supporting dances and some non-dancers.  Baryshnikov in both roles tested his awesome abilities to their limit.  The story-line and its execution are first rate.",1409702400,,367,5.980769230769231
7795799,5,0769720269,"At the time of writing, 14 viewers have rated this 5 stars and one lone sceptic a single star. Include me in with the former. I was anxious about buying a VHS version instead of a DVD ( money is short in the post-Christmas period ) but I need not have worried. The quality of this tape is excellent: bright vivid images and lovely colour tones. The orchestra sounds a little scrawny, but the music is so predictable that it hardly matters, and I have heard worse on highly-rated DVDs. The entire cast dances with grace, panache, and remarkable technical skill. Baryshnikov's choreography as well as his personal performance bring our all the excitement that a top class ballet experience can provide. In addition to classical dancing of the highest order, there is much side play and tomfoolery that might otherwise prove irritating were it not for the infectious humour and enthusiasm of the participants. In two words, highly recommendable.",1275436800,5,942,4.89375
7795800,5,0769720269,This video captures the extraordinary fun that Misha's ballet was-and is.  I had the great good fortune to be in the front row for its world premiere -- and the video dazzles almost as much as that evening.  I'm so glad it's  back in circulation!  Should be in every ballet lover's library.,950313600,10,290,4.519230769230769
7795801,5,0769720269,"Baryshinikov, Cynthia, and Victor Barbee are at their finest in this ballet.  This video should be in everyones library.  It is great entertainment for both adults and children. Another great accomplishment by  a New York ballet company. But, what else can you expect??",925948800,10,269,5.209302325581396
