7704196,3,B01D7A78G8,I found this movie to be a somewhat drab outing. The two main characters do not have good chemistry so I was a little disappointed with this one.,1467331200,5,145,4.214285714285714

7704198,5,B01D7A78G8,"Amy Peterson lives in Lakeside, Washington state and is the daughter of the local fireworks (Peterson Pyrotechnics) company owners, Charlie and Gloria. She has recently graduated from college and is trying to find work as a journalist.  Her boyfriend Hank is all set to pop the question when Amy finds out she has a job offer in Chicago.  Instead of asking to marry her, Hank agrees to try a long-distance relationship.

The relationship fell apart and seven years later, Amy who is a successful journalist at the Chicago Post, comes home to write a heartwarming story about a small company in a small town at the Fourth of July  essentially a story about her parents and what it was like growing up in the midst of a fireworks company. She arrives to discover her old best friend, Sammie, has just become engaged to Amy's old flame, Hank. She agrees to be Sammie's maid of honor even though she doesn't feel wholehearted about the marriage.

In the midst of a lot of turmoil and problems with the town and the fireworks display, Amy finds her feelings for Hank are growing again. She isn't sure about what to do or say so she just tries to go along with Sammie's increasingly strange wedding plans  which I found to be the truly funny parts of this sweet romantic tale.

Meghan Markle is utterly charming as the sweet home town girl returning from the big city with a lot more knowledge of how the world works.  I have enjoyed Ms. Markle in her role of Rachel on the television series Suits for many years. Christopher Jacot as Hank and Kristina Pesic as Sammie, with whose work I was unfamiliar, were also high points in the movie.

The movie is definitely a feel good movie with cute acting and a fun if not entirely realistic plot line  but when are romantic comedies exactly like real life?  I enjoyed my time with these actors and will want to watch this movie each year around Independence Day.",1461974400,13,1901,4.561764705882353

8755110,1,B01D7A78G8,"I really disliked the storyline. I was not crazy about the characters either.

The H and h dated in high school and broke up over seven years ago. The h took off from her hometown for her career. She returns because her best friend is getting married...to her ex. Her bestie has been dating her ex and did not tell her until she announces that she is engaged and getting married. The bestie did not tell her fianc that his ex has returned to be part of her wedding festivities. They are both surprised to see each other after seven years. They wind up doing a lot of the planning for the wedding since the bestie goes off her rocker with her get crazy 4th of July wedding theme. They find that they still have feelings for each other.

I cannot see how the two can reunite so quickly...followed by a marriage proposal...after no contact for seven years. Hallmark films are usually quick with the HEAs, but I could not get over this one. The H had just proposed to the best friend and then he proposes again to the h....not my kind of story or h.  And, what kind of best friend dates your ex...another pet peeve of mine.

The H was really bland throughout the show...no over the top display of love for the h...actually almost non existent as with his character. The bestie was on the other extreme...too over the top nuts.

Not a recommend.",1528761600,,1340,4.387096774193548
8755111,3,B01D7A78G8,"If Meghan Markle weren't starring in this movie, I would've skipped it. When Sparks Fly is a Hallmark joint from 2014, and it's not one of the best ones. Even with Meghan in it. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

Some spoilers.

Meghan is Amy Peterson, an aspiring journalist who grew up in Lakeside, Washington. Seven years ago, in Lakeside, during the 4th of July celebration, Amy's boyfriend, Hank, was about to propose except she beat him to the punch with her own thunderbolt news, that instead of interning with the nearby Seattle Observer, she's accepted a job with the Chicago Post. Hank, poor soul, ended up tucking away that ring.

Seven years later, we hook up again with Amy who is still in Chicago and still with the Post. But the luster's gone. She hasn't been stoked about her job in a while now. And she's not simpatico with her current man, Phil (the toothy Lochlyn Munro). Phil is a sophisticated world traveler who eats fancy dishes where Amy would rather enjoy a burger.

Uh-oh, circulation is down for the Post, and the editor can't emphasize enough the need for relatable human interest stories so as to drum up business.

With the 4th of July holiday looming, Amy happens to mention that her parents operate a fireworks business. Her editor smells a story and promptly assigns her to write a piece about her family and her family business. So, there's Amy heading back home to Washington, not only to write her article but, also, because her best friend Sammie (Kristina Pesic) is getting married and Amy's the maid of honor.

But Amy is in for a shock. Sammie is marrying Amy's ex, Hank. Sammie was nervous divulging this bit of news, but Amy takes it well. It's been seven years, after all. Now, me, it was right around there that I started judging the movie. What kind of bestie would keep it in the dark that she's dating - let alone, marrying - your old flame?

One day Hallmark will present a whole new sack of tropes, but that day's not today. When Sparks Fly rolls out the same predictable elements. Yes, there is some sort of holiday event going on. Yes, there is an ex that was left behind. Yes, the current boyfriend will drop in to escalate the tension and generally make things awkward. And, yes, the family business is in trouble. Amy comes home to hugs and kisses from her parents, but it's up to her to figure out that Peterson Pyrotechnics is not doing so well. But, hey, at least, the water main won't break and the city council won't have to call an emergency meeting and cancel the 4th of July celebration so that the city's funds can be reallocated to repair that busted water main...

What is up with Sammie? I normally like bubbly side characters but Sammie is insanely over-the-top. She is a bridezilla and then some. Her taste runs towards the bold - some would say garish. She opts for a 4th of July wedding theme, and there's nothing that says subtle about that. Sammie's already gone thru two wedding planners, and it's looking like there's about to be a third victim, especially when Marie, the latest wedding planner, counsels her to tone down her ""pops of patriotism."" And there's Amy trying to be a good friend, but maybe she should've been the plain-speaking friend and just told her the truth, that Sammie's notion of an in-your-face 4th of July themed wedding is tacky as all hell.

I wish I cared more about the romantic bits. I don't. Christopher Jacot plays Amy's ex, Hank Lyons, and he's boring. Hank is an attorney-at-law, except I can't see him in court swaying a jury. Hank makes vanilla bored. Anyway, no surprise, Amy and Hank run into each other a bunch of times and feelings that were dormant for seven years get all stirred up. Whatever.

The movie does offer up one pleasant surprise. Amy's current boyfriend, Phil, ends up being a good guy from start to finish. It's nice that, for once, the big city slicker doesn't show up at their significant other's little hometown and snidely makes fun of things. And maybe the best thing that happens in this movie is the very graceful way Phil exits. But then they ruin it by having him come back.

The last 10 minutes of the movie is a masterclass in how to leave a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It's not a good look that they don't even wait long enough for the dust to settle, and for Sammie to get over her grief, and for Phil to get over his, before Hank proposes to Amy and Amy giddily accepts. And it bugs me that a lively career woman would suddenly resign so that she could stay home and do what? Start a new job marketing her parents' fireworks business? Seems to me Amy sacrifices a lot but Hank doesn't lose anything. Meghan Markle reportedly was so dismayed with When Sparks Fly that, right then and there, she vowed to marry a prince so that she doesn't have to anymore get stuck doing stupid movies like this one. But I may have made up that last bit. To sum it up, Meghan is good in a disappointing Hallmark movie.",1528761600,,4932,4.4994413407821225
