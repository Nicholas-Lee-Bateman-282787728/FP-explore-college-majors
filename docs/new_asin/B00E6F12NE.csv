5893413,1,B00E6F12NE,"A bunch of people go crazy because of some nuttiness associated with leap year birthdays and the odd resulting date of 13/13/13.  Much blood and gore and swearing, and all for no discernible reason or purpose.",1383004800,3,209,4.805555555555555
5893414,1,B00E6F12NE,"So...Fat Boy Slim, Fat Boy Fat, Flavaless Flav et al return from trip to find everybody gone mad, indicated by incessant swearing and acts of violence. That's it.
This is as repulsive a film as I've ever seen: coarse and crude with nothing going for it. The script, such as it is, is taken up with constant F-Bombs and the scene in the car park leaves you with the impression that it was completely improvised but there's nothing to recommend it; the direction, such as THAT is, is aimless and the characters are completely transparent. While Fat Boy Slim and Fat Boy Fat discuss the Meaning of Life on the sofa, Flavaless hooks up with Tammy Tu-Tone and for an eternity, they try to carry this mess. The trouble is, they don't try at all. Flavaless barely mumbles past a monotone and Tammy screams now and again to liven things up.
But there's no life in this wretched effort, anywhere, ever. It's as full of holes as a sieve and lacks anything that might be construed as imagination. It looks and feels like a bunch of high schoolers keen to get in front of a camera for what they think is their shot at stardom. Or maybe just bragging rights down the pub. You'd have to be psychic to spot any talent in this bunch.
Awful doesn't begin to describe this atrocity but there is some good news. The film actually does end.
Avoid it, please. If you can't, it's $1.20 at in-store rentals but you'll regret it.",1382486400,3,1405,4.449612403100775
5893415,5,B00E6F12NE,"Written and directed by James Cullen Bressack who brought us Hate Crime, To Jennifer, and My Pure Joy.  Knowing and enjoying James style, I anticipated a lot of insane moments and he didn't let me down.

For millennia, calendars have added an extra day every four years. In doing so, they have violated the ancient Mayan calendar. Now, we are in the 13th month of the 13th year of the new millennium, and the few who survive will battle a world of demons.  The demons basically have infected almost everyone and turned them into crazies.  The infected are insane killing machines, but they're alive and not zombies.

The sky was the limit for James to go ballistic and he sure did.  Horror movies like this are typically slash em up, but James added some fun characters to make the movie even more enjoyable and you may even snicker during some disturbing scenes.

It begins with us meeting the guys on a camping trip.  When Jack (Trae Ireland) returns from the trip everything appears normal..sort of.  His twelve year old daughter Kendra (Tiffany Martinez) smashes a spider in her hands and eats it.  His wife Marcy (Calico Cooper) is compulsively scratching all the skin off her arm.  Jack takes her the hospital and experiences the doctors acting all hard ass dropping F bombs left and right on him. Meanwhile back home, his daughter is in a heated and distressing argument with Jacks friend Trevor (Bill Voorhees).  Spoiler, Kendra wins.

Its pretty whacky and disturbing in many ways and I have to admit funny at points.  Simple things, for example, Quentin (Jody Barton) and Joe (J. Scott) are sitting on the couch drinking beer and you can hear crunching of Trevors head being smashed on the concrete outside by Kendra, all while Quentin and Joe zone out watching TV.  In one scene Quentin stabs Joe and they laugh as if they smoked a pound of marijuana, and then laugh even harder when they smear his blood on the wall.  Quentin and Joe definitely are the Beavis and Butthead of psycho killers.

Jack and Candace (Erin Coker) are the only sane people and meet in the hospital while the world around them is full of crazies.  They team up to escape the hospital and get to Jacks house to save his daughter.  Yeah, the daughter who eats spiders and smashed a guys head on the concrete.

The film maintains the insanity throughout as Jack and Candace struggle to make it to 13/14/13.  What would be more dangerous than 13/13/13?  James Cullen Bressack and Jared Cohn teaming up to write 14/14/14

On the DVD be sure to check out the bonus features which includes a Making Of and Gag Reel.",1382486400,2,2594,4.640350877192983
5893416,1,B00E6F12NE,"There ought to be a law against releasing such a lousy movie. Its a grade ""D "" poorly made and lousy acted movie. I rarely give negative reviews,but this movie is that bad. They should advertise it as a comedy then at least you could laugh at the blood and guts in this movie. I'm actually upset that my girlfriend forced me to watch this movie. She ended up hating it too.",1382227200,4,373,4.194444444444445
5893417,3,B00E6F12NE,"There's only a handful of directors who both impress and improve with each film for me. James Cullen Bressack is one of these. My first introduction to his work was the home invasion movie, Hate Crime, which blew me away. That movie has a mean streak a mile long. Next up, I got a chance to see a screener of his follow-up, To Jennifer, which was not only a good movie, but was even more impressive given that Bressack shot it entirely on an iPhone. Suffice it to say, after these two films, I am officially excited for any and everything coming down the line from this guy. Last Wednesday, I got a chance to see his latest film, 13/13/13 on VOD, and once again, I came away impressed.

13/13/13 centers around Jack, a man in the middle of a divorce, who is returning back to civilization with a group of friends after a camping trip. They stop by his soon to be ex-wife's house to pick up his daughter, and find that things are just a little bit off. He finds his wife attempting to remove the skin from her forearm in the kitchen sink, mumbling over and over again. He rushes her to the hospital, only to find even more strange behavior from it's inhabitants. Things begin to escalate, eventually turning into a full blown murderous riot, and only Jack and one other survivor, a woman named Candace, seem to be immune to the insanity. Together, the two of them attempt to escape the hospital, and make it back to his daughter, hoping that she too hasn't succumbed to the madness.

Chaos, plain and simple. That's what 13/13/13 is. Think The Crazies meets the comic book series Crossed, and you're on the right track. Things start off normal enough, but once the s*** hits the fan, there is carnage all the way to the end. Too many times these kinds of movies purposely don't give any answers as to why things have gone to Hell, but thankfully that isn't the case with 13. I'm not going to spoil it like every single other review I've read, so if you want to know everything going into it, check out the other user reviews at amazon.

Performance wise, I think is where 13/13/13 falls a little shorter than Bressack's previous efforts. The movie is much larger in scope than, say, To Jennifer, but I feel like it was a better acted film. That's not to say that the actors in 13 don't do an adequate job though. Erin Coker turned in my favorite performance as Candace, and Jody Barton, who also appeared in To Jennifer and Hate Crime, was once again impressive. One other interesting tidbit about the cast was Calico Cooper, as Jack's wife Marcy, who is actually the daughter of Alice Cooper. Yes, THAT Alice Cooper. Unfortunately she didn't have a big part, I would've liked to see more of her.

13/13/13 is yet another enjoyable flick on the resume of writer/director James Cullen Bressack. It's intensely violent at times, has lots of the red stuff for the gorehounds among us (including some EYE stuff!), and even has a laugh or two thrown in for good measure. I'm the kind of person who doesn't ask a lot from indie horror films, so anytime a 13/13/13 comes along, it's a pleasant surprise. It's entertaining from start to finish, and that's something that a lot of films with much bigger budgets can't say these days. Sadly, plenty of people will see Asylum on this one, and immediately dismiss it, which is a shame. Bressack fans will definitely have a blast, and there's some fun to be had here for fans of flicks like the aforementioned The Crazies, and 28 Days Later as long as you have realistic expectations going in. Recommended!",1382140800,,3542,4.521060842433697
5893418,5,B00E6F12NE,"13/13/13 is a great movie directed and written by James Cullen Bressack
and released by Asylum films. This movie was well written, well filmed
and acted. The only thing the film could have used is closed captioning
for some us older folks...lol. Anyone that has not seen this film,
please either go out and buy it or you can rent it at redbox first.
That is were we watched from and now i got to get my own copy of this
one. I am a big fan of horror films especially ones done by independent
directors and screenwriters. James Cullen Bressack has written,
directed and produced many films in the past.  After you watch this one
 you might want to check of many of his other films.",1381017600,2,680,4.346456692913386
5893419,1,B00E6F12NE,"I just finished watching this movie, and it seems like a good movie as described but it is SO INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE and it ends so abruptly that you cannot believe it.  DO NOT RENT THIS OR BUY THIS MOVIE.  You will be disappointed no matter what I guarantee it.",1380844800,2,259,4.26530612244898
5893420,1,B00E6F12NE,"The fact that this centuries' trifecta doomsday dates ended at 12/12/12 did not deter the folks at Asylum. Never should the facts stand in the way of a horror film. For some reason ""we"" were never meant to have a leap year, but rather ""we"" were supposed to add a month every 120 years. Apparently the creation of artificial calendars has a profound effect on people. On this new calender date of 13/13/13 people suddenly go into a berserker mode for no real reason and people born on Feb 29 are unaffected most likely for the same reason, whatever that is...my guess is angering the calendar god of an extinct civilization.

Okay, it is easy to overlook plot point stupidity in a horror film, especially Asylum. This creates a zombie like atmosphere where a small group of people (in this case 2) must battle against raging hordes of humanity who also like to kill each other and themselves. Jack (Trae Ireland) our main character takes his divorced wife (Calico Cooper) to the hospital leaving his daughter Kendra (Tiffany Martinez) alone with his redneck buddies. When all hell breaks lose he wants to go back home to try to find his daughter who wasn't born on Feb 29...

That is the story. There are gallons of blood all over the place with the opening scene being a sad display of special make-up. There is an unreasonable amount of F-bomb dropping with an uncomfortable scene with 12 year old Kendra crudely asking a grown man if he wants to have relations with her making this unrated film unsuitable for most people.

This is not the direction Asylum needs to go.

5893421,1,B00E6F12NE,"I'm so glad to have this opportunity to save all my fellow movie buffs in this genre from wasting even a moment considering this horrible experience.  What a waste of time. Yes, I rented it and thinking (maybe hoping) by some miracle that it would start having some redeeming  qualities - it didn't.  The concept doesn't make sense, the acting is worse and the ending....there isn't one.  You're left out there in the great abyss to figure it out on your own I guess.  Let me wrap it up with a bright red bow so there's no confusion on what I think - I hated it.

If by some mistake you do rent it, like me, you'll see in the first 5 minutes what you're in for the rest of the time - stop the show & select another movie worthy of your time.  It's so bad.",1380499200,5,755,4.095238095238095

5893446,3,B00E6F12NE,"Upon seeing this is released by The Asylum, you might be tempted to
flee in the opposite direction as fast as possible, but you would be
missing out on something they are not known for...an actual good film.
That's right, a good film...not a 'so bad, it's good' film like most of
them are, but a solid, well directed film that rises above it's
budgetary restraints. From the interesting premise, to the camera work
(with some great tracking shots), to the 'didn't see that coming'
moments, and finally, to the insanely dark humor...it all adds up to an
enjoyable time.

Of course, it's not without its problems. I mean, this is still an
Asylum picture we're talking about here, but this is quite the step up

It's a unique horror movie and a breath of fresh air because it isn't really a zombie film. It's something very different.  I normally don't like The Asylum's movies, but this is by far the best one they have done.  A solid ride with some great gore.

8602022,1,B00E6F12NE,"Our civilisation, using the modern calendar, has made adjustments by including a leap day each four years. Apparently this has violated the ancient Mayan calendar and because of this, everyone except those born in a leap year are affected by a violent madness.

This film is another example of someone at The Asylum having an idea for a film but no thought as to how to implement the idea. We find out quite early on that people are firstly, very angry, then generally become homicidal. However there is no attempt to explain who is responsible and why the introduction of a leap day would have offended someone. It seems that the filmmakers simply needed an excuse to film the butchering of expendable cast members. And even this is done badly.

Most of the acting is amateurish, but it doesn't help that there doesn't seem to be a script much of the time. Characters get their 5 minutes in front of the camera and just rant about nothing, then get killed. Boring.

To make it even worse, the film just ends without any attempt at explanation or resolution.

The Blu-ray presentation is fine in regard to definition (Asylum standard) but the colours are very washed out. And although there is a DTS-HD MA soundtrack this is wasted as there is really nothing in the sound department to work with.

An awful, lazy film that is unlikely to entertain.",1483833600,2,1348,4.670886075949367

8602029,3,B00E6F12NE,"Now just to get it out of the way, the things that I didn't like about the film. 13/13/13 is a pretty low budget film with some pretty low budget acting. Some of the dialog driven scenes in the film where a bit too amateurish, forcing uncomfortable breaks in the flow of the story. The acting at times was over exaggerated by a couple of actors and some of the dialog may have been more than the cast could convincingly convey. That is it, aside from that bit of failed execution from this production, I enjoyed the other aspects of 13/13/13.

What really hooked me with this film is Bressacks ability to fuse his distinct style and vision of pushing the comfort level of the viewer. This film showed that same disturbing atmosphere that Bressack has become known for in such films as Hate Crime (again, a killer film) and To Jennifer, both films where like watching real life crimes taking place that just happened to be on video. That is why I love James Cullen Bressacks work. Some of that intense and chilling vibe was visible in this film as well. All be it, not as much as I would like, but it was enough to make me want to follow through with this film.

The effects in 13/13/13 are 50/50, when it works it works great and when corners were cut-it showed. Still the fact that the camera found inventive ways of showing the grue and kill moments in this supernatural horror story, is entertaining. Plus the fact that Bressack didn't shy away from getting in there and shooting the full on effects of the killing or brutality is note-worthy. He doesnt leave it to the imagination, instead he sears it into our brain visually. 13/13/13 is not gonna be for everyone because of the ultra low budget feel of the film but I did. Let me explain, this film has a cool concept, plenty of action and gore.",1432512000,,1801,4.438066465256798
8602030,2,B00E6F12NE,"I am going to up the rating to 2 stars because the acting in this film is actually pretty good, considering the script everyone is working with. There is not much going on in the movie, plot-wise. When the Mayan date 13/13/13 rolls around, everyone not born on a leap year date of 2/29 goes violently psychotic. Sane ex-cop meets up with sane woman in a hospital, and they spend the movie escaping from the hospital and trying to retrieve the man's 12 year old daughter, left at his house with his goofy friends.

Movie comes off as ""what if everyone started acting like they were in a violent video game?"" style action horror. Lots of blood, profantiy, brutal beatings, but no rape or nudity. And women are shown to be just as violent as men. The cover of this DVD is very misleading, as the supernatural content is nil.",1427241600,,821,4.473333333333334
