The writing is crisp and the stories, although pretty stock from week to week, offer the actors opportunities to explore their characters and play off one another in ways that all great shows accomplish. The theme is medicine and curing the sick, who enter with unexplainable maladies, but the core of the show is House's personality, vented through the horrible pain he endures every day and the obsession with solving the medical puzzle of the week as he deals with his misanthropic personality They should just give Hugh Laurie a lifetime Emmy and be done with it. He is magnificent as House, surly, thoughtful, funny, rude, brilliant and always compelling to watch. House's sessions in the clinic are practically stand up comedy and Laurie's timing is perfect.
The supporting case, with Omar Epps, Robert Sean Leonard, Jennifer Morrison, Lisa Edelstein and Jesse Spencer are all first rate and the show is always well directed. The medical procedures are graphically realistic and the prop department should also be commended in this regard.
For a show which centers on such an absolutely likeabley dislikeable guy, the issues and human frailties addressed in each show range from poignant or frivolous and back again, and that is what makes House so addicting.",1246752000,2,1337,5.109589041095891

3824099,5,B001W79MKO,"This is the same review I wrote for seasons one and two:
I don't watch a lot of television but I have been ill lately and I've stayed tuned to USA most of the time. This is where I discovered House MD. I'm so glad I ordered it to watch on DVD without all the sappy commercials and so that I could view the show in order. The episodes do stand alone but the story among the main characters is the best part and worth waiting to see when it comes out on DVD instead of upending your life to catch it on TV every week. Not being a TV person, it's impossible for me to find anything to compare it to. I'm sure anyone would enjoy it.",1245542400,,628,3.9140625

So, not sure about that part of the service. I would recommend this seller and will also make purchase from this seller in future.",1269388800,,305,4.169491525423729

8347031,3,B001W79MKO,"Giving my experience 3 stars because there was some mix-up in the shipping process-- shipping took much longer than the average or the expected. About a week after placing the order, I asked the vendor for my shipping confirmation.  To my surprise, I was told the order has been delivered to someone else's shipping address.  I asked for a refund, and the vendor said that they accidentally gave me shipping information for the wrong customer and that my order was still on its way to my shipping address.  I asked again for a confirmation number, but never got one.  I eventually got my items 3 weeks after I initially placed the order.  I bought the boxed sets as a birthday present, but of course, they didn't arrive in time.  I think the experience would have been much different if I were kept in the loop of what was going on (i.e., if I were able to track shipment)!
Regarding the product itself, I have no complaints once they arrived.  The DVDs were in excellent condition, and the price was more than fair. My only caution is the shipment speed.",1249776000,,1055,4.550264550264551
8347032,3,B001W79MKO,"The House series is great. The two seasons I bought were sold as new but were not.  The third season had a DVD scratched so bad that I could not get it to play.  The fourth season had finger prints on the disks as well as two disk ones and disk three was not in the package. I was lucky that a local retail store exchanged both seasons for me for free or I would have been out my $42.00.  If these DVDs are used then they should be sold as that, not sold as new.",1248566400,,462,3.7916666666666665
8347033,5,B001W79MKO,If you Love House buy the 2 disc set and save almost 50%.  I was doing research on House and stumbled across the Season 3 & 4 set from Amazon.  It's a Steal!,1247184000,,157,3.727272727272727
