7038035,5,B00UGPWVPG,"I received this set for Christmas from my family.

The three discs include the original theatrical release, an 8 minute extended Director's cut and a 16 minute additional directors cut.  The discs are contained within pages of a booklet which is then placed in a cardboard sleeve.

The transfers are flawless.  The audio is great and the video is pristine.  THIS is the way to watch movies.",1483056000,13,390,4.7611940298507465
8705887,1,B00UGPWVPG,"A collectors edition? Dont think so!
Yes, the 3 discs include the original theatrical release, an 8 minute extended Director's cut and a 16 minute additional directors cut; I would consider this a collectors edition if it was widescreen. Instead, its full screen and theres no widescreen version.
Dont waste your money on this.  Back to the drawing board... looking for a widescreen version, uncut on the sides.",1533859200,,411,5.044117647058823

8705896,3,B00UGPWVPG,"Avatar is a wonderfully cinematic, adventurous film.  The graphics were stunning and groundbreaking for it's time.

It is, however, heavily undergirded with an animistic/Mother Earth religious view that features heavily in the storyline.

Many before me have pointed out the echoes of indigenous resistance against colonistic imperialism.

While visually stunning with solid performances by actors, the animistic worldview is heavy handed and impossible to avoid.",1504569600,2,463,6.076923076923077
