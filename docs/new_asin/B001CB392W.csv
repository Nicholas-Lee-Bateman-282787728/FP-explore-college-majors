8286372,5,B001CB392W,"During the mid 1960s, two of Tolstoy's novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina, were filmed in Russia by directors committed not only to rendering the costume drama entertainingly but to transmitting Tolstoy's complex artistic vision. Both films unquestionably are among the greatest of their kind produced in any land. But in their country of origin they were not necessarily treasured -- that is, preserved. Around the turn of the millennium, efforts were made to recover the films, and the results, released by Ruscico, are more or less equivalent to releases from Great Britain's Masters of Cinema or the U.S.'s Criterion.

Zarkhi's Anna Karenina focuses on Anna's human tragedy. It does not attempt a full exposition of Tolstoy's text; Joe Wright's highly stylized 2013 film probably captures the architecture of Tolstoy's vision more accurately, but with such emphasis on artifice as to reduce everything to a celebration of artifice. Life is a game of scripted characters without even the possibility of essesnces. Zarkhi conveys the muddle of social and personal delusion unflinchingly, yet he clearly believes (his sense of tragedy requires him to believe) that there is an end to the tunnel, even if it's dark outside when you reach it.

 Anna Karenina has inspired, besides Mr. Wright's movie, a number of ""high-concept"" films in the West with strong casts, but no Western rendering has featured an actress as inspired as Tatiana Samoilova, who combines the beauty of an Audrey Hepburn with the acting abilities of a Barbara Stanwyck or a Meryl Streep. Samoilova devoted several prime years of her life to portraying the doomed heroine of this film (yes, years were spent filming it). In the extras her artistic commitment to the role is made indelibly clear. The other principal actors in the film (none of whom were known to me, an average Western DVD collector) also give extraordinary performances.

Then there is the matter of script, direction, and cinematography, In this regard the film compares favorably to cinema in Sweden, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Germany during the mid 1960s. Many scenes are visually iconic, as in Bergman. Perhaps more importantly many are also psychologically iconic, such as the one where Princess Kitty interviews Count Karenin. The end of the movie is a high point, thanks to its cinematography.

Then there is the matter of sets, costumes, and music. All are exemplary, with the sets and costumes subtly accurate about the realities of upper-class life in Russia's 1870s, and the superb score by Rodion Shchedrin a worthy successor to Prokofiev's scores for Eisenstein.

There isn't an ounce of pretension in Zarkhi's rendering of Tolstoy's tragedy, only the believable simulation of deep human feeling, insights, and reality. If in your choice in entertainment you are attracted to such efforts -- and do not dislike foreign films --  I predict you will find in this an experience long to be remembered. The extras are generous, as in the better Criterion releases.",1446422400,,3023,5.144602851323829
8286373,5,B001CB392W,"One cannot but be amazed at such a work of art, the best ever that gave its cue to all the other tentavive spin-offs. Of course, there are two sets of DVDs and one must get up to insert the other one in order to see the other half but who really remains concentrated on a long yet prestigious and never boring movie for a long time (it can be kept for another evening) and if at all who cares when one really wants to see it through with abated breath?
The boni here are not the making-ofs and the now so sought-after blobbers (which often make the charm stale or gives the film its redeeming charm when it's a poor one!) but the profusion of languages with which the movie is dubbed and subtitled. I could even have it watched by my Chinese sister-in-law who was ravished by the exactness of the subtitles...
Sorry guys, but I can't give nothing else than what it deserves: a laudatory recommendation for all those who really want the right interpretation of Anna Karenina once in their lives!",1240704000,,994,4.378378378378378
