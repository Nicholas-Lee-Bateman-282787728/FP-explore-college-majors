3911501,2,B002DLB18E,"I read Jonathan T's review and realized that this product has changed from what it was originally. The picture displayed is not what you are sent. Now being a 2 disc set, the box is much thinner. The box we received mentions special features, but we can't find them on the two discs provided. My daughter's enjoyed the episodes provided, but wished there was more and were expecting the special features described on the box. Note on the product details it lists the run time as ""98 minutes"" but the editorial reviews is comprised of a single statement that it's runtime is ""179 minutes"".",1347062400,5,588,4.663461538461538
3911502,4,B002DLB18E,"Of the 6 sets that were released I tend to watch Bizarre Murders the most. However, like a lot of fans I was extremely disappointed at the way Cosgrove and Meuer decided to release the show on DVD. If Unsolved Mysteries hadn't been such a fantastic show, I would understand cutting down a lot of material into these segmented box sets. I watched the show from beginning to end and always hoped (even before the onset of TV DVD box sets) that somehow I could own every episode ever made. I thought it would've been crazy to try and tape every single episode when it went into syndication on Lifetime but now I'm kicking myself for not doing just that. The creators could've done a much better job at choosing what to include in the sets. For someone with a mild interest in the show I'm sure the sets we were fortunate enough to have will do just fine. But for the serious fan like myself it'll leave you very frustrated.",1341705600,15,920,4.385964912280702
3911503,5,B002DLB18E,"I love scary things, not sure why but I do. I already have another unsolved mysteries dvd,so I am trying to add more to my collection. I find unsolved mysteries very interesting it's something that you turn on and you can't turn it off because it is so intriguing. Ever since I was a kid I used to watch unsolved mysteries. Little by little I will purchase the other volumes.",1326931200,,375,4.371428571428571

3911505,3,B002DLB18E,"Almost 5 years ago, in April 2007, I bought the original Unsolved Mysteries: Bizarre Murders DVD Boxset (4 DVDs, 6 Hours). Now that Disc 1 of my set have flaws, I have decided to buy this DVD, containing only Disc 1 and 2 of the orginal Boxset. I bought this DVD for less than 10$, brand new, so it's not a bad deal.

On this DVD you'll find some fascinating cases: The murder of Danny Casolaro, the Disappearance of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman, The Infamous Boston Strangler case, the Psychological profile of World Leaders, The murder of a female prison guard....There's some good story there. Out of the 15 segments I think only 8 are really, really good, the others are a disappointment. Disc 3 and 4, only available in the original Boxset, had all the best stories. I have read that they won't release a Volume 2. So my questions are: WHY ?? and WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ?? I can't understand this. You release Volume 1 without having any plans to release a Volume 2 !? This is really stupid. They did the same thing with the Boxset about Ghosts, they have only released Volume 1 and it seems like they won't release Volume 2. This is really disappointing since Volume 2 of the Bizarre Murders would have been really amazing, all the best stories are on disc 3 and 4 (I would have bought it, my discs 3 and 4 also have some minor flaws, not surprising after almost 5 years).

I am aware that In late 2010, First Look Studios ceased operations and declared bankruptcy. However the new owner, Millenium Entertainment, can't release new Boxsets !?

The most frustrating part of all this is the fact they, the producers or whoever made the DVDs, have decided they won't release any other Unsolved Mysteries Boxset in the near future. Unsolved Mysteries recorded more than 250 episodes, there's hundreds and hundreds of fascinating Murder cases that will never be released on DVD, they could have released at least six or seven 4 discs Boxset about murder cases. Or what about a Boxset about Missing people ?? Sadly there's enough segments to release a 6 hours DVD set, it would have been amazing, without a doubt a must-own. Thank god for Youtube, where you can find most of the episodes.",1318032000,31,2191,4.584183673469388

3911525,5,B002DLB18E,"Note: This is for the full original set of four discs, not this new vol 1.

-The case where the two boys who were run over by the train was shocking and one of my favorites. Also the one where the guy appeared to be killed and lowered into a tank of hot liquid for being a whistelblower. Could've omitted Richard's Rampage, which basically has a guy go nuts after a girl leaves him, not bizarre really. There were many episodes on Youtube that aren't on DVD, a drunk teen who was found dead after a party, I think his shoe was located and they never found his cause of death. Also one where two teens go missing after hitchhiking. All in all, great stories presented here. Not sure what limited episodes are on these volume sets. Looks like the full set is out of print and expensive now. Hope my discs don't get scratched or I'm SOL. Youtube pulled eps also.",1402531200,2,859,4.302469135802469

3911540,4,B002DLB18E,"I love Unsolved Mysteries and I was delighted to find the episodes on DVD my only complaint is that they don't come as seasons, they're just a bunch of similarly themed episodes on a couple of discs. I expected this by the title but I would still have liked them to come in seasons.

The case is nice, I received it in perfect condition and I have enjoyed watching them again and again.",1386547200,3,386,4.287671232876712
