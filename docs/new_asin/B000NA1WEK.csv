2762923,2,B000NA1WEK,I bought a double-feature DVD from the seller. One side of the disc played just fine. The second side had trouble reading that there was even a film to be read. I had to re-insert the DVD several times for the player to recognize the DVD. The film skipped a few times throughout the viewing and towards the end of the movie it got stuck for 20 minutes and it will not allow the rest of the film to be viewed.,1318636800,,408,4.049382716049383

2762925,5,B000NA1WEK,"(This is not a review of the movies themselves; you can look at the IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or MetaCritic websites to get a wide view of people's opinions, if you're so inclined.)

If you've never seen or don't have either of these movies, this ""double feature"" dvd is a great deal. The picture is good quality, and each movie is complete with extras; somewhat surprising, since it's a double-sided dvd, rather than two dvds in one case.

This is a great chance to get two good movies, without taking up as much space or spending as much on shipping.",1239148800,11,549,4.5353535353535355
2762926,5,B000NA1WEK,"More of these double and triple featues are starting to show up, with their original screen ratio and as separate discs in a single case. This one pairs two excellent films, and for the cost is quite a steal. Let's hope all the studios invest in this trend with their catalog items.",1183248000,5,282,4.4423076923076925

8176019,5,B000NA1WEK,"Both great movies and having them together is a double bonus! Training Day is very well known and a movie I will continue to watch for years and years and years. Fallen is less known but I still really enjoy it. Some action and super creepy but with a solid plot too. Another one I've watched multiple times. Do yourself a favor, dig out the old school DVD player and buy this!",1462320000,,377,4.25
