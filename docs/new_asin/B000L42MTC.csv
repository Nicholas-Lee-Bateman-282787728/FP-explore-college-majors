about this and saw they made a movie about it and as a big fan of Donald Pleasence I knew it would be good and it is excellent. I'm surprised
this was never shown on TV or is a much bigger movie. It's based on a true story of a doctor that killed his unfaithful singer dancer wife and
ran off with his secretary but was caught by authorities before reaching America and found guilty of the crime and hanged. Pleasence plays
the part as he was Dr. Crippen and the cast of Samantha Eggar and others are also excellent. It's a well written court drama mystery. I read
the true story and it's not exactly the same as it happened but new evidence shows he may have been innocent. Anyway I can recommend
this movie to fans of classic mystery drama true story type movies. This is not a horror classic as they never show the actual murder.
If you want a Region 1 copy you can find one at FindersKeepers Classic who have this and other great rare movies and TV shows.",1452038400,4,1106,4.125
