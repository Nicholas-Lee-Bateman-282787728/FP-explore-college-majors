7913572,5,B00000JRU8,"Wing Chun Kung Fu, Volume 5 by William M. Cheung

This volume 5 of the video or DVD series simultaneously summarizes basic concepts already covered in previous volumes in a clever, almost imperceptible manner of blending the concepts in with some new scenarios.

General topics covered in this volume include Wing Chun Fighting Strategy, Tactics and Techniques to deal with other fighting styles in opening moves, Dim Mak, defense against various confrontation scenarios against an armed assailant wielding various weapons, at the conclusion of this volume William Cheung and his assistant perform the Chi Meditation ritual again.

Wing Chun Kung Fu fighting strategy integrates a unique combination of basic, elemental concepts to form the strategy into the system as it is learned and practiced.  These are the basics: guarding the center line of the body from attack, attacking the opponent's balance, opening the opponent's defense to counter attack, gaining control of his elbow and maneuvering him or setting him up to have his arms crossed to which will hamper his efforts to attack and provide the opportunity for the defender to take the offensive at the moment of best opportunity.  Other elements of Wing Chun strategy include avoiding a clash of force against force or power of the defender against power of the attacker. In this regard Wing Chun shares with aikido and jujitsu practitioners a similar strategy and attitude in dealing with an attack.

William Cheung's series of Wing Chun Kung Fu demonstrations on VHS or DVD is consistent with the information contained in James Yimm Lee's book, ""Wing Chun Kung Fu"" as well the books authored by William Cheung such as ""Advanced Wing Chun Kung Fu.""  The VHS and DVD series bring the illustrations of these books to life.

Any Karate or Kung Fu practitioner will be able to appreciate what Wing Chun Kung Fu has to offer or contribute to their own practice of martial arts.

Although this series of Wing Chun Kung Fu demonstrations is available on DVD or VHS, I recommend that you buy this series on DVD so that you can replay sequences of moves and the applications of moves in fighting in slow motion or freeze scenes for better examination.

This Volume 3 of Wing Chun Kung Fu is Primarily about Wing Chun training on the wood dummy used by kung fu practioners.  Therefore, I suspect that many viewers who are not Wing Chun practioners but are merely interested in viewing some of the advantages or unique qualities of Wing Chun, perhaps to look for tips in training and to increase their arsenal of martial art techniques and tactics, will be impatient with all the scenes of wooden dummy training maybe to the point of being disatisfied with the purchase of this volume.

I don't think there is much new in this volume in the way of applications of sequences of moves to which have not already been covered in volumes 1 and 2.  However, there are at least 11 breaks in the scenes of wooden dummy training during which times the previously executed moves on the wooden dummy are demonstrated as applications of moves in fighting between William Cheung and his assistant.  Each set of move sequences are demonstrated several times for the viewer to follow.  I do think that any serious practioner of Wing Chun or any one who wants to become a serious practioner of Wing Chun will be satisfied with the purchase of this volume.

This whole series of Wing Chun Kung Fu is available in both VHS and DVD.  I sincerely recommend that you buy the series in DVD because DVD viewing has certain characteristics, absent in VHS viewing, which supports an almost interactive learning process if the viewer knows how to use the controls and functions of his or her DVD player.  Furthermore, Wing Chun is an intelligent fighting system with some subtle and clever moves which are easy to miss while observing William Cheung and his assistant demonstrate them.  Use DVD slow motion play back and freeze scenes where ever there is a scene or sequence of moves you need to observe for better understanding.

After the completion of all the coverage on wooden dummy training and the applications of their moves in fighting, William Cheung and his assistant demonstrate more Chi Sao moves, techniques and tactics which he had begun in volume 2.",1097971200,7,2133,4.722371967654986
7913574,4,B00000JRU8,"I bought this because it has Big Dragon in it. (Little Dragon is Bruce Lee) This tape shows good moves but not enough to satisfy me. Wish it was longer for the price. I m not saying its not good. This tape does not have classical drills but has few techniques on how do defend on common kick and also some hand blocks.  He also goes on to CHI training techniques, which are kind of neat. This tape shows just enough where you have to buy the rest of his series. Maybe that was the intent.",971049600,,488,4.083333333333333
