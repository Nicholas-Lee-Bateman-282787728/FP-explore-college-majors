BUT, don't like it that the only character that ""breaks the forth wall"" - or whatever the saying is - and looks at the camera for a few seconds, is the creep lead actor who is less than the scum of the earth. I closed my eyes, I didn't want to ""have a moment"" with this scum. What is behind this? A desire to sow debauchery into the society at large by doing this? What was the director thinking?",1434153600,2,440,4.127906976744186

6866861,5,B00QG6IBAI,"An intriguing story, made all the more so because it is true.  This DVD contains two discs, the first of which is the full story of Lord Lucan and his infamous deed.  The production of this first disc is excellent, with quality acting and settings.  The second disc has less value, as it deals with what might have happened if Lord Lucan had been apprehended and brought to trial, something that has never happened.  The cast in the second disc is different from  that of the first disc, and I found the actors to be less interesting.  Buy this DVD for the first disc alone, and consider the completely fictional trial scenes to be a less successful frosting on an otherwise excellent cake.",1432425600,,690,4.569105691056911
6866862,5,B00QG6IBAI,"Where IS Lord Lucan? The 1974 vanishing act by the 7th Earl of Lucan remains one of Britain's most tantalizing unsolved mysteries. More than 40 years after the wealthy gambler was last seen, the crime still resonates with British citizens and indeed, anyone who hears of this puzzling tale. This two disk set takes viewers through the events that unspooled beginning with the brutal death of the Lucan family's nanny and coincidental--or was it?--disappearance of Lucan, portrayed here by Rory Kinnear (who was brilliant in Skyfall!). Whether Lucan was involved in the murder, or whether he's still alive today, no one is certain, but the second disk in Acorn's set bookends the mystery by offering the intriguing ""what if"" element: the imagined trial of Lucan. Witnesses and prosecutors weigh in, and Lucan has the chance to explain and defend himself. Would Lucan walk? Is he still around today, living on a cache of hidden cash? This is a mystery we haven't heard the last of. And Lord Lucan, if you're out and about, you really need to watch this DVD set, then let us know if the details are spot-on!",1432166400,,1104,4.815789473684211
6866863,5,B00QG6IBAI,"THE MYSTERY OF LORD LUCAN is an absorbing, intense drama based on the true story of an English Lord whose life of privilege and luxury was no escape from the degradation and tragedy that eventually destroyed him. Or did it? Lucan disappeared immediately after the attempted murder of his wife and has never been seen since. Though in all likelihood long dead, there is still an air of mystery that hovers around the mere mention of ""Lucky"" Lucan's name.

Rory Kinnear is a wonderful actor and an excellent choice to play Lucan. He conveys so much with so little, giving the impression that Lucan was something of a stoic, rarely betraying his feelings about anything as they simmered dangerously inside him. Kinnear portrays the build up to Lucan's premeditated actions with an understated fury that is actually quite creepy. His performance is so convincing that the viewer has no desire to live the life of the upper-class if this is what it leads to: an unhappiness so overwhelming that it throws everything to the wind.

Christopher Eccleston gives a stand out performance as Lucan's best friend, ""Aspers"". A true eccentric, Aspers has his own private zoo and is seen feeding a pet monkey at the dinner table and relaxing reading the paper with a baby tiger on his lap. He personifies the ""us"" against ""them"" (the lower classes) and cannot for a moment fathom that his friend Lucan has done anything wrong.

THE MYSTERY OF LORD LUCAN works as a character study, a murder mystery, and a scathing comment on the English class system, where people who live lives of privilege cannot possibly be blamed for anything. The program reminds us that no one is above the law.

A second film, made twenty years after the crime in 1994, imagines Lucan's trial. Despite some outstanding actors such as Robin Ellis and James Faulkner playing barristers, the show is simply a re-hash of the known facts about the case. It doesn't work as drama and is best forgotten.

The first film, however, is exceptional, and this rating applies only to it.",1428969600,5,2033,4.797142857142857
6866864,5,B00QG6IBAI,"THE MYSTERY OF LORD LUCAN, 2013.  This ITV British TV series examines a decades old unsolved true crime, one of the most notorious in recent British social/criminal history.  In 1974, John Bingham, the 7th Earl of Lucan, an infamous gambler, (he did nothing else), known ironically as Lucky for his immense losses at the tables, vanished without trace after allegedly murdering his childrens nanny Sandra and attacking his wife. In this box set, two dramas explore  Lucans scandalous life, aristocratic circle, and disappearance. The two-part LUCAN, based on the book THE GAMBLERS by John Pearson, as adapted by Oscar-nominated writer Jeff Pope (PHILOMENA), directed by Adrian Shergold, gives us snapshots, through flashbacks, of the Lords troubled life in those overheated times. THE TRIAL OF LORD LUCAN, a 1994 imagined courtroom drama, examines the cases evidence, clues, and motive, based on research and forensic detail; the jury, of real British citizens, delivers its findings.  The box set consists of two discs, with a runtime of 214 minutes, and has subtitles, thank goodness.  Be aware, however, that profane language is plentiful. I received this as a review copy.

The gripping and atmospheric series does an excellent job of portraying the extravagant high life of Britains high rollers at the time.  LUCAN  stars Rory Kinnear (SKYFALL,THE IMITATION GAME, PENNY DREADFUL) as Lord Lucan, a desperate man with a gambling problem and a bitter, crumbling marriage; Catherine McCormack (BRAVEHEART) as his ignored, abused wife; the greatly respected veteran Michael Gambon (HARRY POTTER) as John Burke, club employee; Paul Freeman, (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK)  as John Pearson, who starts the explorations; the fine actor Christopher Eccleston (DOCTOR WHO, SHALLOW  GRAVE, THE LEFTOVERS)  as the easy-to-hate Lord Aspinall, owner of a series of once famous private gambling houses such as the Clermont Club, and a well-known zoo at his stately home that is open to the public. And Rupert Evans as Dominick Elwes, for whom this whole business was just too much; Jane Lapotiere as the older Susie Maxwell-Scott, whod been around the Clermont as a younger woman, and thought, as an older one, that the aristocrats friends might well have tired of his troublesome nature, and rid themselves of him.

THE TRIAL OF LORD LUCAN stars Julian Wadham (THE IRON LADY); Lynsey Baxter (THE FRENCH LIEUTENANTS WOMAN) and Anthony Head (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER).  The episodes are, with thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn:

Disc 1 (Lucan)
Part 1
While researching a book about London's posh gambling scene of the 1960s and '70s, writer John Pearson becomes transfixed by the story of the missingand perhaps murderousJohn Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan. Pearson delves into Lucan's world as the high-born lord struggled to keep up appearances amid staggering gambling losses.

Part 2
The battered body of the nanny of his children lies in the kitchen of his home, and Lucan has vanished. As a national manhunt begins, the lord's aristocratic circle closes ranks. With his wife offering damning evidence, Lucan is tried in absentia.

Disc 2 (The Trial of Lord Lucan)
In this fictitious reimagining, prosecutors present the evidence against the Lord, witnesses attest to events, and Lucan has the chance to defend himself at last. In the end, a jury of real British citizens gives a verdict on the famous crime.

Author John Pearson began unspooling this unholy tale in 2003, as he interviewed the now elderly John Burke and Susie Maxwell-Scott for the book centering on the Clermont Club, a Mayfair casino run by ruthless John Aspinall some thirty years earlier. Mind you, it is still not publicly known, today, where exactly Lucan disappeared, whether he remains alive, when or where he died -- though some of his former cronies, for whom he became too hot to handle, may guard this knowledge. Its an exciting story, very well-done by all hands, though, with dark material, profanity and many unknowns, it may not be for everybody.  But I lived in the United Kingdom in the late 60s, early 70s, was well-aware of the club and its denizens, found Lucans disappearance fascinating, and  loved this telling of it.",1428710400,12,4195,5.133627019089574
6866865,5,B00QG6IBAI,"While not knowing previously of the historical London murder, I was fascinated. Engrossed to the max. These 2 representative TV stories regarding the real murder event which took place Nov 7, 1974 use the same police facts. Nearly a decade separates the two films but they differ little, excepting casts. Both have excellent well-known actors. The different approaches to telling Lucan's story makes both worth viewing. They involve both fact and fictional enhancement.
Then you'll likely, as I did, get on the Internet and find out it is all true, and see photos of the real people, location, and more. Spellbinding.

SDH SUBTITLES provided for both features.
LUCAN (2013) has Paul Freeman playing author John Pearson as he researches the events of the Lord Lucan case for a book the real author Pearson published called ""The Gamblers"". This is a two part 136 min production. Pearson interviews Clairmont Club employee Burke (Michael Gambon -`Cranford' `Wives & Daughters') in 2003, long after the murder. Susie (Jane Lapotaire -`Marie Curie') also offers memories, and possible outcomes. As they chat, backstory is played out by Lord `Lucky' Lucan (Rory Kinnear), Lady Lucan (Catherine McCormack -`Land Girls' `Braveheart'), club owner Aspers (Christopher Eccleston -`Cracker'), Dominick (Rupert Evans -`Emma' `Rogue'), and many more, including the Dowager Countess of Lucan (Gemma Jones -`Duchess of Duke Street'.) Also Alistair Petrie (`Forsyth Saga') & Andrew Woodall (`Belle').
LUCAN Part 1 primarily provides the author history up to the murder. Part 2 offers the story aftermath of a murder followed by another attempted murder, and how the rich friends of the family react after the accused Lucan vanishes and the inquest takes on the characteristics of a murder trial.

TRIAL OF LORD LUCAN (1994) uses the same police facts and inquest details to have an imaginary trial as though Lord Lucan was arrested the morning after the murder that took place in his home. He claims he saved his wife from being the 2nd victim. A ""real"" jury was seated to hear the recreated filmed testimony and allowed to make an unbiased verdict. I'll not spoil the faux verdict. In this 78 minute trial with flashbacks, Julian Wadham (`War Horse' `Iron Lady') is Lucan; Lynsey Baxter ('Prime of Miss Jean Brodie') is Lady Veronica; James Faulkner (`I, Claudius') plays Lucan's barrister; Anthony Head (`Iron LADY') as Dominick.
The real ""Lucky"" Lucan has never been seen since the murder night--the police case remains open--an arrest warrant is still out.
Intriguing bit of British crime history. Glad I watched, enjoyed, and learned. Proves true-life events can be dark and creepy too.",1427932800,12,2674,5.216279069767442

6866871,3,B00QG6IBAI,"I have followed this story in the British press for years now, and wanted to see if this DVD would add insight to the Lord Lucan mystery. I was undecided on purchasing the DVD because one reviewer mentioned swearing, and I don't watch movies that contain obscenities. Yet another review from a reviewer I respect deemed it worth watching, so here's what I did: I borrowed the DVD from the library and only watched the second DVD, which contained no obscenities, and which attempted to depict what would have happened had Lord Lucan been arrested. I believe the second DVD was worth watching, even though it was fictionalized, because it presented  real-life evidence that prosecutors had been building, and contained actual quotes from those involved in the case. If I were to rate the second DVD alone, I would have given it 4 stars. The first movie was unwatchable, so I would have rated that one star. This DVD has spurred me on to pick up a number of books on the case (Dead Lucky, A Different Class of Murder, The Lucan Conspiracy, and The Gamblers) to find out more.",1439683200,,1072,4.6421052631578945

8691179,4,B00QG6IBAI,"Entertaining true crime mystery involving an Aristocrat, who with a little help from his friends, may have gambled his future away. This DVD set contains two treatments of the Lord Lucan affair. The first DVD recounts the murder of Sandra Rivett, nanny to the Lucan children, and the assault of Lady Lucan. Lady Lucan survives the assault and identifies Lord Lucan as the assailant and murderer. Lord Lucan runs away and is never seen again.
The second DVD supposes the possible murder trial and jury verdict of the accused Lord Lucan. Based on actual testimony from the investigation and inquest. An interesting scenario.
 As portrayed in this mystery, Lord Lucan is either an entitled, wife beating cretin twit or a misunderstood, loving father twit who is just trying to earn a living for his family.
Spoilers. Unfortunately, he is a professional gambler who is frighteningly unsuccessful. He is in debt up to his eyebrows. Lord Lucan is a husband and father who spends his waking hours and his money at an upscale gambling establishment, The Clermont. This DVD treatment presents him as a cold, unpleasant fellow with no humanizing moments.
It's hard to have any sympathy for this fellow. We see him strike his wife in the presence of his children and on another occasion he gains temporary custody of his children in an ambush-the-Nanny-maneuver at a public park. In an attempt to gain permanent custody of his children, he takes his wife for a country drive which includes a stop at a psychiatric hospital where he attempts to have her involuntarily committed.
  Finally, Lord Lucan has his very expensive day in court. His wife outmaneuvers him, while he has enlisted all of his friends to attest to what a crazy bugger she is, Lady Lucan has expert psychiatric testimony swearing that she is depressed and anxious but not mad or crazy.  Lady Lucan is awarded custody of the children. Unhappy Lord Lucan may have taken counsel from his friends and decided to revisit the custody issue by staging a home invasion and spousal murder.
 But if there is one thing that Lord Lucan (as portrayed) has evidenced, it is his complete inability to get anything right. He can gamble but he can't win. He can convince everyone in his circle that his wife is nuts, but he can't sell it to a Judge. He can plan a murder with his own hands, but he evidently can't find and kill the intended victim in the dark of the house. This fellow is an incompetent boob. If he is innocent then he lost his chance to prove it (and to be with the children he loved) by fleeing the scene of the crime.
 The rest is pretty anticlimactic, Lord Lucan runs away, his friends and family stonewall the investigators, the results of the inquest finds Lord Lucan to be the primary suspect. I imagine that his family and friends assisted in his escape, and he lived out his days like some remittance man in days of yore. Sad for the murdered Nanny and her family.
