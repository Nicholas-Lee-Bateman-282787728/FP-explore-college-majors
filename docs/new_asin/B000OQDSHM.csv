8186322,5,B000OQDSHM,"A saw two great movies about men with Down syndrome - one we might call high functioning and one who does not speak with words.  They joy of life they both have, the need of their caregivers and friends to know what it is they really are saying and want, and their tremendous value to the world - indeed the great gifts both have given to seemingly everyone they encounter - are amazing to anyone who does not know somebody with Down syndrome.  The two movies - Teachings of Jon and Shorty starring Shorty Simms - show you this across what is called the functional spectrum.

8186323,5,B000OQDSHM,"As someone who spent my summers at HSC when I was growing up, I had many fond memories of life on campus (my grandfather was a member of the athletic department). And of Shorty. Watching this film certainly brought back many of those memories. Even more so, however, I was struck by how so many different people from different backgrounds and different areas of the country truly rally around and love this wonderful person. Walter's story is truly inspirational. While the movie itself doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles as far as production value (it almost seems like a compilation of home movies), the message it conveys is certainly one from which we can all learn.",1340150400,,676,4.737288135593221
8186324,5,B000OQDSHM,"Wonderful and heartwarming story of leadership excellence:  A family committed to a son / brother with Down's Syndrome.  Walter Symms (SHORTY) loves everyone unconditionally and finds his niche in life serving others in the athletic department of one of America's oldest and most renown colleges.  What a climatic victory ""The Game"" brings to Walter's 56th birthday!",1211846400,5,366,5.5
