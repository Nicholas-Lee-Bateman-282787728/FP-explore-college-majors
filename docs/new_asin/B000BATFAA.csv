2410411,4,B000BATFAA,"I love the dvd - Annette Maria has a great presence, the dvd is beautifully broken down and indexed and the steps are fresh and new.  Having said all that, I can't get the jump roping down.  I use a 9' rope and I'm 5'8.  I keep tripping over the darn thing.  I can't manage anything more than the basic steps.

I gave the dvd 4 stars because it IS a well-made dvd with lots of new ideas to help keep jumping rope from being boring.  I'm fairly active (I do FIRM aerobic dvds daily) and just couldn't do this.",1140134400,2,508,4.03

2410414,5,B000BATFAA,"I am a natural wellness practioner and former amateur fighter. I was already a big fan of Annette Maria's rope dancing; however, recently I learned that a new version of the original DVD was available. Because I was satisfied with the lessons on the first video which I had been recommending my to my clients, I quickly ordered the new DVD for my girlfriend who has also expressed an interest in learning jump  rope techniques. She would rather practice in private with the option to rewind if necessary. My girlfriend purchased her jump rope and began practicing the steps Annette teaches in the instructional part of her presentation. Now, we both can take advantage of the benefits of jumping rope. My girlfriend says that she plans on challenging me to a jump rope dual, I may just let her win because she looks so good!",1126310400,2,824,4.682758620689655
2410415,5,B000BATFAA,I can't believe after decades of diets and never keeping my weight off I can honestly say that this video has changed my life. After only one month I've lost 15lbs. and I'm still eating whatever I want. This is the best workout imaginable and the routines and music are awesome. But above all this is the most fun I've had losing weight ever! Thanks Annette Maria.,1126224000,4,364,4.447761194029851
2410416,5,B000BATFAA,"I've tried the gym, walking, and other excersise video's, I've given up on them all.  This one keeps me comming back for more. It's fast moving, and the music is great! Annette keeps me motivated. 30lbs. melted away and I am feeling 15 again.  Thank you Annette.",1126224000,2,262,4.553191489361702
2410417,5,B000BATFAA,This is a great idea. It is so easy and fun. Now I know why prize fighters have been doing it since boxing became a sport. I recommend this DVD highly.*****,1126224000,,156,4.064516129032258
2410418,5,B000BATFAA,"Thanks, Annette Maria, for such a unique and fun spin on something that I loved to do as a child.  This approach to exercise is not only FUN but it works!!!!!!!",1126224000,2,160,4.161290322580645
2410419,5,B000BATFAA,"My wife and I both thought we were too old to start jumping rope but found it to be hysterical fun starting up this new again inovative form of excersise that has been used in the boxing world for a hundred years. This DVD is inspirational and you don't have to follow along to keep going with your routine, unlike other videos it really gets you going, is fun and doesn't require any bulky equipment.",1126224000,2,401,4.36
8084353,1,B000BATFAA,"this video has very poor audio , not worth the cost, presentation appears like low budget , not the $22 cost, don't waste your money",1310428800,,132,4.32
8084354,3,B000BATFAA,It helped a little but I was looking for more of  a routine. This video just taught the basics of how to jump.,1186963200,,110,3.782608695652174
8084355,3,B000BATFAA,"Annette Maria introduces new steps to spice up jump rope routines, and that's great. Jumping rope is great for losing weight, and to be frank, it doesn't matter HOW you do it, as long as you do it. This is a video that I ran through once, picked up some favorite steps, then I just used those steps at the gym with only my iPod for company.

The sound quality for this DVD isn't great; the microphone sounds like it's floating somewhere above the instructor's head, and as a result, her voice sounds kind of echoey and hollow.

If I could do it all over again, I would rent this DVD rather than buy it. If you're a fast learner, you can just watch it once, and you'll do fine.",1168905600,6,676,4.1923076923076925
8084356,5,B000BATFAA,"I love this dvd.  The video is well made.  The dvd itself is well indexed and it is very easy to go to any part I want.  The picture in picture is very helpful in learning the dance steps.

  Jumping rope is one of the best exercises available.  It is both an aerobic and strength training exercise.  It works and it is a real timesaver.

  The problem with jumping rope has always been that after a while it gets boring.  Doing these dance steps while jumping rope gives all the benefits and is so much fun the time flies by.

  Annette Maria has an excellent presence and does a great job as an instructor.  It's a relief after listening to so many ""over the top"" screaming instructors.

  I have read that in older versions of the dvd that the music was not in sync with the dancing.  I can tell you that everything is in perfect sync on this dvd.

  I liked the fact that the instruction and the  dance routines use real songs rather than the monotonous electonic beat that accompanies most exercise dvd's.  In general, this dvd is quite good to jump rope to and I actually enjoy some of the songs very much.",1158537600,9,1112,4.281553398058253
8084357,1,B000BATFAA,"I own what seems to be the previous version of this video, but I must say it did nothing for me.  Apparently this new version closes in on the feet so you can learn how to do the steps better, which I imagine would be helpful.  Version #1 has none of that, the music is boring and the tone of voice the trainer uses is mostly dull.  No excitement, which to me is a MUST!!

I'm afraid this is one DVD that will go back in the shelf for a long time.",1157500800,2,447,3.8260869565217392
8084358,5,B000BATFAA,"I'm new to jumping rope, so i'm glad that I purchased this DVD.  The directions are easy to follow, espeically since the camera zooms in on the footwork.  Ther is no doubt that jumping rope HAS to be one of the BEST ways to get very fit.  I also like that the complete routine is a whole seperate segment!  Sometimes, I just like to practice the steps with the instructional part.  AND I can listen to my own music and it still works!!!  That alone is a great workout!!!",1154563200,4,470,4.224719101123595
8084359,5,B000BATFAA,"THE DVD LOOKS GREAT, BUT WHO REALLY CARES- WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHETHER OR NOT IT HELPS TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD!

BELIEVE OR NOT, I'M ALREADY NOTICING A DIFFERENCE IN MY ARMS AND CALVES, I USED TO JUMP ROPE A LONG TIME AGO FOR FIVE MINUTES OR SO, BUT THEN I GOT BORED . THE ""PICTURE IN PICTURE"" IN THE VIDEO SHOWS ME ALL THE DIFFERENT STEPS I CAN DO SO THAT I WON'T LOSE INTEREST AFTER FIVE MINUTES. I GOT A LOT OF HELPFUL AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION FROM WHAT KIND OF JUMP ROPE TO USE, TO WHAT STRECTCHES I CAN DO. THE LAST PART OF THE VIDEO HAS THE MOST RELAXING, WINDING DOWN MUSIC I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME.",1154304000,5,608,3.9836065573770494
8084360,5,B000BATFAA,"I got the brand new version of the DVD. (I don't know what the old one was like, but this is GREAT!!)I really like the ""Picture in Picture"" because it helps me with the steps and shows me with a real close view that I don't have to jump so high to get a great workout. I'm beginning to build real stamina. I also like that it helps me to be able to improvise if I would like to, but right now I'm jumping in time with Annette and the great music that goes with the steps. I really like the ""Twist"" number with the old time rock music. It's easy to keep the beat. I have a book that teaches basic steps, but nowhere have I seen anyone do the Samba with a jumprope. It's FUN, FUN, FUN!!! and makes the time pass quickly. No wonder she looks so good.",1153267200,3,747,3.9536423841059603
8084361,5,B000BATFAA,"honestly, i was skepticle at first. i was expecting to either not follow along or that it would be boring. but its really fun. thanks for making this uncomplicated. i can skip rope for 30 minutes now! the music is great and annette is very motivating. im getting back into great shape and my arms are looking good. definitely reccomend to anyone. what a great new idea. thanks for making exercising fun again :)",1152748800,3,411,4.5675675675675675
8084362,1,B000BATFAA,"Did this video for the first time this morning.  Jump roping is GREAT, a fabulous workout, no denying that, but skip the video.  It's really just some basic steps that you need to get down (and I found some how tos on the web so don't need the video for the steps) and then you can just do this on your own. In fact in the video, she keeps saying to make it up as you go along... certainly don't need her video for that.  The music is TERRIBLE and only about 60 secs of the routine is actually in sync with the music. Being a dancer my whole life, it's incredibly difficult to have the beat of the music and not be moving to it.  So all the video is good for us a few basic steps which I'll just do while watching TV or listening to my own music and actually keeping time to it ;)  Also, I found Annette (?? I think was her name) annoying (voice annoying too) and she talks WAY too much in between stretches, steps, cool down, etc.  The info is fine the first time you do the video, but you certainly don't want to hear it every time. Save your $$$ and just do a web search for ""how to jump rope"", ""jump rope steps"", ""jump rope dancing"", etc.  I will be selling mine...",1152576000,6,1169,4.012931034482759
