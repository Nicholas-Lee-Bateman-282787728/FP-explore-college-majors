8711415,1,B00VVYYBH2,"Too many unrealistic situations.  Jose Luis is overly gushy in his courtship and passion.  He would turn a woman off with his gushiness.  Victor makes too many stupid decisions. He saves the man's life who has been tormenting his family because the man tells him that as soon as he dies a hitman will kill Victor's wife and daughter, but how will the hitmen know if Pedro is dead?  Victor could have let him die and gone to get protection from the Marines and the police.  Who would want to marry such an ""scaredy cat"" man?  Alejandro is in a coma for 7 years.  Really? and Adolfo keeps on killing the good guys instead of turning state's evidence and asking for immunity in order to get out of the criminal life he hates. The kids are kidknapped for two months after Graciela points out the house where Pedro is keeping them to the Captain in the Marines.  Seriously? And nobody has a funeral like the one at the end of the movie. So Monserrat makes a dramatic entrance into the church, opens the casket and then turns around and walks out without staying for the ceremony?  Really?",1522886400,,1083,4.456852791878172
