5228,5,0767023765,This movie is the best movie I've seen when Washinton crosses the delaware to battle the Heshens is the best part,953596800,,113,4.428571428571429
5229,5,0767023765,"this was a great movie that really helps you see into the heart and mind of General George Washington, His Generals, and his soilders. Even if your just looking for a good action-drama, this is great. Jeff Daniels is  magnificent and so is the senery, battles, camera work, etc. An enticing  film about the troubles of crossing the river keeping them from trenton...  a must see.",951868800,7,379,4.712121212121212
5230,5,0767023765,"Superb movie, excellent casting ! Just as in Gettysburg, Jeff Daniels gives a magnificent performance. What impressed me the most however, was the realistic portrayal of just how close we came to never achieving  independence ! A must see for all those interested in the American  Revolution.",950054400,2,292,5.191489361702128
5231,4,0767023765,"I loved the true story of courage.  I objected to the cursing, because the reading I have done about Washington describes him as an introvert, and a God fearing man who constantly encouraged his men to pray, repent, fast and seek divine guidance for the cause of the revolution.  I think the frequent cursing was added to the story by script writers who thought the language would add drama to the situation, which it did not!",1513382400,,426,4.592105263157895

5233,4,0767023765,"With his Continental Army shrinking around him George Washington has someone 'requisition' some ships to get his men across the river so they will not be as easily accessible to being demolished. He gathers with advisors and is ridiculed for his lack of leadership and the fact that he ahs not won a battle.

For his last act he decides to attack Trenton, New Jersey where Soldiers of Fortune are stationed, to accomplish that they will have to get a thousand men across the river, at night in the cold for Christmas! They arrive at dawn and attack. Interesting and insightful. War violence, swearing.

In Extras is a making of feature in which Jeff Daniels talks.",1509667200,,664,4.7155172413793105

5235,5,0767023765,"Jeff Daniels is one of my favorite actors. In this film he plays the part of Gen. Washington who leads his forces across the Delaware river to attack Trenton. Mr. Daniels plays the part of Washington with great humor, which of course in real life Washington never had. But Jeff Daniels makes Washington seem like a man you would follow, because he could lead.",1507852800,4,359,4.625

5262,5,0767023765,This is one of my favorite movies that I can haul out and watch over and over especially at Christmas time. It sticks pretty closely to the historical event and has some humor as well. Jeff Daniels always looks just like whomever he is depicting. It's quite uncanny.,1484352000,,266,4.5625

5268,5,0767023765,In insightful take on of the most important but nearly forgotten battles of the Ameican Revolution which had the longest odds and gambled the survival of independence in the most uncertain weeks of the war. Washington's crossing of the Delaware to attack Trenton is known more for a painting it inspired but  the film goes deeper into the battle that kept the cause alive and an army intact when defeat seemed inevitable.,1478044800,2,421,4.847222222222222
5269,5,0767023765,Jeff Daniels plays a convincing role as the desperate George Washington in December 1776.  The movie does a good job of evoking the chaos and challenge of those weeks just before the first Christmas of independence.,1477872000,,215,4.972222222222222

THE IMAGE OF G. WASHINGTON WAS.  FOR ME, THE PART THAT IMPRESSES ME THE MOST IS THE ""SURPRISE"" ABOUT SOME THINGS HE DID - AND HOW THEY DID THEM.  (NOTE: I WILL BUY ANOTHER COPY OF THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE I SURE DON'T WANT TO LOOSE THIS ONE. IF YOU GET ONE, AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS GRAY IN APPEARANCE, THAT WAS DONE ON PURPOSE. AFTER THE MOVIE FINISHES, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW WHY.  JUST WAIT FOR THE VARIOUS ""INVITATIONS"" AND IF YOU READ THEM, EACH ONE WILL ADD QUITE A BIT REGARDING THIS HAZY WEATHER.  I SAY THIS ALSO BECAUSE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN NEW JERSEY. IF THEY HAD USED BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, IT WOULD NOT BE AUTHENTIC.

5292,5,0767023765,"The Crossing covers a small but crucial part of the American Revolution. Based largely on Washington's personal correspondence, it is probably fairly accurate, but without embedded journalists, who knows for sure.  Daniels plays Washington with dignity, and passion.  The supporting cast of little known actors do quite well also.  The battle is well staged despite Hollywood's abhorrence of muzzle loading muskets and their capability of fully automatic fire.  This film can stand with Gettysburg as the best look at part of one  of America's wars.",1457568000,,549,5.411764705882353

5303,5,0767023765,"A&E does a masterful job of putting together a top-notch cast with an event of great importance to the future of the foundling United States of America.
The acting, portrayal of conditions and general lack of support and material for prosecuting a war against Great Britain was well done. The moral of the Continental Army under Washington was at an all-time low prior to the crossing. Indeed they had known little but defeat until that time. Washington even had his doubts about whether some of his chief commanders would even follow orders.
The story of the crossing, the hanging in the balance of the war with Great Britain, and the attack on Trenton are all masterfully done. Kudoes to A&E. May they continue to produce more historically based efforts of this quality in the future.

Does it have the production values of ""John Addams"" or ""Band of Brothers""?  No but I doubt ""The Crossing"" had the same budget.

5349,5,0767023765,"I saw this movie years ago and recorded it off TV.  After many years and a format transfer, my copy was in pretty poor shape.  Happy to have a DVD copy to enjoy (as I did last night).

""The Crossing"" tells the story of General George Washington's preparations to attack the Hessian soldiers (in service to Britain) at Trenton on Christmas 1776.  The movie highlights the disagreements and personality conflicts between Washington and some of his key commanders, and the challenges of pulling off such a revolutionary attack.

The movie benefits from many quality actors and from its tight focus on the build-up to the crossing, the crossing, fight, and immediate aftermath.  I don't think I'd known until watching this that Washington's men retreated back across the river after the attack.

My only real quibble with the video quality is that you can tell where the commercial breaks were from the original TV production airing.  I would think that they could have edited the video together a little bit better so that those weren't as noticeable or else didn't exist at all on the DVD.  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie, but it was noticeable at least a few times.

I liked Jeff Daniels from his work in Ted Turner's Gettysburg/Gods and Generals and like him here as well.  As with the two movies I've just mentioned, this one gives little bits of info on what happened to some of these historical figures after this battle.",1421712000,4,1442,4.728

5368,5,0767023765,"""The Crossing"" is a surprisingly well-done TV historical drama based on General George Washington's iconic crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night, 1776.  The moment, and the movie, focus on a low point in American fortunes during the Revolutionary War.  Washington's Continental Army had been driven in defeat from New Jersey by the British Army, and faced dissolving altogether as enlistments expired at the end of the year.  Washington daringly staked everything on a surprise counter-attack that caught the enemy sleeping off the holiday in Trenton in the early hours of 26 December.  Washington's high stakes gamble saved the Continental Army, and perhaps the young United States, from extinction.

Jeff Daniels is very credible as the stern and determined Washington.  The supporting cast is also quite good, especially Sebastian Roche as the tough-minded General John Glover from Massachusetts, now unfortunately largely forgotten in history, whose Marblehead fishermen rowed the Army across an ice-choked river.  The production values and the attention to detail should easily satisfy most viewers.  It would be hard not to be caught up in the drama of the situation.

5386,1,0767023765,"The portrayal of Washington was so contrary to what we can know of the real man from his own personal writings and from that which was written of him by his contemporaries that watching it aroused in me anger and sadness.  I originally bought this movie in order to select a 30 minute clip of this relevant Christmastime topic to show to my chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The foul language made it undesirable from the beginning. But worse, was that the writer, director or actor must not have bothered researching the person of George Washington. He would not have taken the name of the Lord in vain and did not even allow his men to swear. He was known to have impeccable manners, yet this movie has him loudly belittling General Henry Knox, in front the troops, for being overweight! This was supposed to be the funny part of the movie, I suppose; making fun of a great American hero who, one year earlier, was responsible for the British evacuation of Boston after having captured 59 canon and mortars from Fort Ticonderoga and bringing them 300 miles in the worst of weather to General Washington.

Jeff Daniels played Washington with no personality whatsoever. He was expressionless throughout the movie! Impatient, rude, snide - yes. But void of positive character traits. Washington was made to look like an imbalanced, foolish man. In real life, no one would have put such a person in a position of  leadership or would have followed him. There was NOTHING admirable or endearing about Daniels' portrayal of this revered American founder.

The saddest part of all of this is that the Amazon star rating here shows that most Americans have not studied history enough to realize what was so grossly wrong with this movie",1394668800,13,1750,4.781456953642384

The movie is more of a Hollywood action/drama style movie than a ""boring"" biography/non-fiction history movie. However, it does contain quite a bit of crude language, gratuitous violence (when they surprise the Hessians), and adult scenes.

While it is a serious, well-filmed story on General Washington's most challenging times during the war, with plenty of drama built into it, it is very much a factual masterpiece, more than adequately supported at the conclusion by a summary of the lives of the individuals who were most prominently featured in the story.  The film carefully built up enduring the dire situation at Valley Forge into culminating with Washington's famed ""Crossing of the Delaware,"" no mean logistics feat at the time, and the surprise taking of the British forces at Trenton

Perhaps the most powerful aspect of the film is Jeff Daniels' portrayal of George Washington, during which he once again showed his versatile thespian abilities.

5406,5,0767023765,"December 1776: The Revolution thus far, was a disaster.

For twelve months the first American patriots had endured very little success against the British, being out-classed and routed from the battlefield in almost every engagement. Desertion was rampant. Arms, ammunition, and rations were scarce. Only a small number of the Revolutionaries had any military experience.

Even worse, as was usual in warfare until the 20th century, epidemic diseases were the major cause of casualties, with so many men living together in the open under unsanitary conditions. As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.

With the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.

At this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.

So how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!

General Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!

Washington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.

Despite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.

They moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.

This factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing:
The Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning! Not one Revolutionary soldier was killed or injured in the attack on Trenton! Needless to say, ...this victory had the desired result on American morale.

The man who delivered this Christmas Present to America was OUR Founding Father, ...George Washington!
He succeeded because he was assisted by REAL MEN who were determined to accomplish this mission.

The real signifigance of this movie:
There have been several moments in the history of America, at home and abroad, where the nation faced seemingly overwhelming enemies, and abyssmally dire circumstances. This film portrays one of the first of such incidents. REAL AMERICANS take action. They lock and load, fix bayonets, ...and by the grace of God force a glorious victory from what was presumed to be an ""inevitable"" defeat. Be thankful that we had a REAL AMERICAN in command on Christmas Day of 1776!",1380326400,4,3797,5.237232289950577

5408,5,0767023765,"I've read several histories of Washington and/or the Revolution, including ""Washington's Crossing"" by David Hackett Fischer - a very good book and surprisingly easy to read - and ""1776"" by David McCullough, which covers the Battle of Trenton in detail. This film - despite some revisionism - is an excellent portrayal of the crossing and the Battle of Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a surprisingly good job of characterizing Washington's demeanor, patriotism and dedication to the ""Glorious Cause"", as most revolutionists of the time called our American Revolution. After all Daniels is not new to portraying historical military figures, having portrayed Joshua Chamberlain in ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". In fact the acting by the entire cast is uniformly good throughout. Despite his dedication and patriotism, Washington had surprisingly little military experience before taking command and had to learn as the revolution evolved. Trenton was his first real battlefield success. Washington came very close to losing his army; and we came very close to losing the Revolution in 1776. It was mostly due to Washington's determination and daring that we were able to continue fighting instead of going down to an inglorious defeat. This movie does a good job of telling that story...it is an excellent film and an excellent history lesson. I think General Washington would have smiled and nodded in agreement after watching this.",1378944000,2,1434,5.373333333333333

When you see just how close the entire endeavor was to defeat it makes you astounded that we sit here now 50 states strong.

At first it was frustrating to watch him until I started focusing on the history that was being shown and then it was unbeliveable what they went through to accomplish what they did.  Also, my understanding of Washington was that he was a very God fearing man and would retreat into the woods or pirvate places to ask for guidance from God.  None of this was protrade.

Few Americans realize how close this nation came to losing its bid for independence from Great Britain.  It was Washington's bold raid on Trenton that resurrected the American cause.  Never before or since has our country been so close to utter defeat and needed a military victory more.  This film offers a detailed and entertaining glimpse at this incredible feat of arms.  Jeff Daniels is excellent in the role as our first Commander-in-Chief.  The production values are good as well.  It's almost like looking back over 200 years at an event as it was happening.

How is it possible that anybody could take such a boring subject as Washington crossing the Delaware and turn it into a totally realistic trip back in time to a place and event that has become a clich' over the years?

5431,1,0767023765,"Just saw The Crossing tonight.  I'm a huge Jeff Daniels fan.  I thought the scenery and costumes were great, battle recreations great, but as a whole the film fell short.  Numerous historical inaccuracies and important omissions, and a seeming obsession to make sure we knew that every character in the plot was a bawdy-talking, cussing, irreverent man of the world.  It was really over the top.  No way will I show this to my kids; not just that the cussing is excessive, but it's probably historically inaccurate and the portrayal certainly unbalanced.  In fact, at times the course language seemed to become the main POINT of the film rather than the historical significance of what was happening.  And we know from numerous histories and accounts written at the time by eyewitnesses that even though Washington had a bad temper, he restrained it and only used curse words on rare occasions (historical accounts indicate the shock by his staff when he cursed out Gen. Charles Lee at the Battle of Monmouth, because it was so uncharacteristic of him to use foul language and he actually ordered his soldiers not to do so).

Historical inaccuracies and important omissions abound: After the battle, Washington orders a retreat back across the Delaware; in reality, the army stayed in NJ and laid another trap for the British which ended up in a follow-up victory at Princeton.  And the attack on Trenton also included a planned second crossing that never materialized, adding drama that this film ignored.

On top of that, Daniels' portrayal of Washington seemed off compared to what you read by men of the time, including the soldiers who fought with him.  He was known as a hard man, but a also a gentleman much loved by those around him (other than the ambitious would-be usurpers); but in The Crossing, he just comes across as a hard man, and at times a jerk.  It was not a portrayal that seemed credible--who would follow this guy into battle?

Finally, and perhaps worst, we end with a totally fictional bit of ideological, PC revisionism when American Gen. Nathaniel Greene scolds Washington for his idealism, reminding him that the Revolution is all about the Colonists' greed, which Greene says is no different than that of the Hessians.  What??  That was the last straw for me.

The Crossing isn't a good history lesson at all, other than the outdoor scenes.

The acting is superb, and no one outshines each other. You become taken in by each player and the parts they participate in with the operation, which is the famous crossing of the Delaware River into Trenton,New Jersey to defeat the Hessian Mercenaries. I enjoy the sense that although this may not be absolutely accurate in all details, I do get the feeling that this is about as close to what it was really like with the conditions they faced. Gritty and raw, coarse language abounds but it also invokes the reality and urgency of the threat that Washington faced as the British were bearing down on his downtrodden group of soldiers. The film leaves you with a sense of great pride and wonderment of the spirit of patriotism.",1349568000,3,952,4.775757575757575
5443,3,0767023765,"I am a bit of an American War Of Independance buff and this movie at least attempted to address one fault shared by most films on the subject, the Rebels themselves or Patriots is perhaps a better word were not all naturalised Yankee Accented Americans. Apart from Al Pacino's messy film, Revolution, every film i had seen until this one had the usual upper class Brit accent for the Redcoats and Traditional American drawl for the Patriots. The ranks of the Continental army included Ex-British soldiers and officers of the French Indian war,outraged by the policies and taxes levied by King George. Imagine the anger these men must have felt at having fought the French to protect King Georges interests in America, only then to be asked to pay for the pleasure through unfair and extortianate taxes. Add to this British settlers equally outraged at not being allowed to be represented in Parliament, plus naturalised Americans, Irish, Scots, Dutch, French and German settlers. Two contrasting scenes show the divisions within the American Colonies. When George Washington tells the owner of the boats he is borrowing them, the boat owner protests and tells the Continental Army that they are all mad and will hang. Contrast this with the Englishman who offers George Washington and his Officers the use of his house for shelter and food. Whilst i enjoyed this movie, particularly the portrayal of Washingtons officers having varying American,English,Scottish and Irish accents, i thought one scene was absolutely unescessary and it is fictional. Horatio Gates was as as British as they come, but he did join the fight against his King and became a celebrated though sometimes controversial figure of the Revolution. Most of the controversy is based on his opposition to George Washingtons military tactics, Gates favoured Guerilla tactics in the early stages as he was of the opinion, and its a well founded one, that the Continental Army at this stage was neither strong enough or equipped to fight Redcoats or Hessians head on. Of course we know that on this occasion he was proved wrong, but the scene where he is ordered out of the camp under threat of being shot is pure fiction. Gates left of his own accord but i got the feeling that the Director or screenwriter realised that they hadn't show a stereotyped bad-guy Brit in the movie and decided to add this scene to address that. Portraying Gates as a pompous snob was off the mark and an insult to a man who distinguished himself during the war. Still I just hope that one day someone will produce at last a decent movie or mini-series which accurately portrays a defining point in World history. But most of all a film needs to be made which pays tribute to the men and women of that period in history who suffered so much to give birth to a new nation, it needs to show that Americans were born of a variety of peoples and nations within the former colonies. Perhaps another thing which should be looked at is the effect on the Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic, in England the Colonists had provoked a lot of sympathy amongst the working class and even Fifth columnists had formed to oppose King George, so much about this conflict remains unexplored on film and its a shame. It was all of these things, a struggle for human rights, equality, freedom. greed,ambition and even as suggested by many historians, a civil war.

I bought this as part of the History Channel Founding of America box set and I'm still working my way through the DVDs.

This and Washington the Warrior were very well done,  but  do  not  waste  your  time  on the ""founding fathers"" and ""founding brothers"" History Channel DVDs.

5449,1,0767023765,"TV History reveals new and fascinating facts, either hitherto unknown, or previously ignored.

Viewers are informed, twice, that at least two general officers in the Continental Army shaved with cold water, one of them being the army's commander-in-chief.

While Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton became legendary for his hospitality, and especially for the generous helpings served to guests on a groaning dinner table. His expertise in carving a roast may have originated years earlier in a small cabin on the outskirts of Trenton, New Jersey, where the inventor of American banking put aside his duties as colonel of artillery to slice up a half dozen Hessians.

Colonel Rall, commanding the Germans, certainly took his time getting dressed for work. All those enemy troops storming past his bedroom window don't seem to have distracted him from getting his necktie on straight.

By contrast, Colonel Glover is portrayed as somewhat of a fashion emergency. And at the pivotal conference prior to the Battle of Trenton, he makes a scattered, rambling, speech on wig etiquette.

Among the hardships suffered by the Continental Army's rank-and-file, a shortage of pipe tobacco appears to be a close runner-up to the shoe shortage: They're reduced to toking up cornsilk.

Bookseller turned ballistics expert Henry Knox is relegated to comic relief, a sort of Oliver Hardy in period costume.

And those poor Hessians can't seem to escape the slur that they were hung-over on duty. Not much truth to this, ditto for the ""mercenary"" label these hapless losers can't seem to shake. When it comes down to it, they were shanghaied. But never mind, movies are about entertainment. Whoever choreographed their antics must have had a sense of humor: With those outlandish uniforms, they pass for Keystone Cops. And the extras really seem to enjoy hamming it up.

After an hour and a half of loopy dialogue and low-budget props, I did manage to score a few laughs. But wait. Something was missing. This film was shot up in Canada. So why isn't there any snow and ice? Wasn't that the whole thing about Trenton? The harrowing night march and daring assault in the dead of Winter?

There is a redeeming moment. Reality intrudes when one of Washington's staff suggests that all wars are basically about money. The famously stony Father of His Country nods in grudging agreement.",1298419200,9,2369,5.069408740359897

This is the only video I could find on the Battle of Trenton and I was looking to show it in history class.  This video is useful in a classroom setting, but there is some minor profanity.

The highlight's of this video are:
Washington's discussion with his fellow commanders- Their reactions are well portrayed, especially that of Horatio Gates.
The actual battle itself- Many assume there was no fighting at Trenton, but this video (although inaccurate in many ways) shows that fierce fighting did indeed take place.
The actor who plays Henry Knox- Fat and funny, he provides some humorous moments.

Some of the details left me wondering if the producers of this show did any research on the Battle of Trenton.
Alexander Hamilton was not General Washington's personal aide, and he did not storm the Hessian guardhouse and slaughter five soldiers with only his sword.  Where this came from, I have no idea.

The scene after the conclusion of the battle shows Washington asking how many casualties were sustained at the battle.  A fellow commander replies, ""none sir.""  Two continental soldiers did die of exposure on the ten mile march to Trenton.

Some important details were left out, many were distorted, but this is entertaining and the actors were well cast.

One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: ""how many killed?"" ""None"" (correct). ""How many wounded?""  ""none"". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States.

The Americans walk unopposed into Trenton and even have time to set up their cannons and place their troops just right.

5464,5,0767023765,"Jeff Daniels had brought to life previously a great figure in American history by his masterful job as Joshua Chamberlain in 'Gettysburg'. In 'The Crossing' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn't. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.

'The Crossing' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington's friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.

The film captures the cold of winter well and is a DVD to watch in December-January when the leaves have fallen off the trees and you have a warm crackling fire inside. This film captures that tough winter well and the spirit of the men who remained and the great leader who led them in one great roll of the dice. I wish more films were made about our Revolution.

The DVD has good picture and sound plus an interesting little 'making of' the film as an extra.

George Washington was one of the giants of history, and this film is a dramatization of one of his many great achievements -- the Battle of Trenton.  Leading a small, discouraged, and cold and hungry American militia Army, Washington took on the finest soldiers in the world and won a great victory.  Had he not done so, the American revolutionary cause might well have failed.  History correctly records that it was George Washington whose inspired leadership won the Battle of Trenton.

Jeff Daniels does splendidly as George Washington, and the supporting caste is also quite good.  The film moves at a brisk pace, never drags, and engages the viewer's interest at all times.  Highly recommended.",1239321600,2,859,4.923611111111111

5470,2,0767023765,"I recently saw the HBO miniseries ""John Adams"" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of ""John Adams"" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.",1216252800,11,3360,5.0653357531760435

5472,4,0767023765,"In all honesty, I expected this to be a so-so movie, however it turned out to be well done and very enjoyable. Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.

I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.

The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.

There is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated.

5480,4,0767023765,"There are some historical inaccurracies in this film, to be sure. The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.

I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.

Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.

The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.

Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon!

5482,5,0767023765,"I give this film five stars despite some of its historical innaccuracies because it is so well produced.  Compare this movie to say something like Mel Gibson's PATRIOT and you have the difference between quality and trash!  The movie conveys the feeling and desperation of Washy's army on its last legs before striking back at Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a spirted but probably false impression of Washy.  In reality the man was much more stiff and proper than is shown here.  Washy would never use such language in front of the common soldiers!  He rarely lost his temper as well, otherwise the famous tongue lashing of Charles Lee at Monmouth two years later would never have created such a sensation as it did.  Daniels makes Washy much more likeable to the modern audience, but is an flawed portrayal.

The production value of this film is first-rate.  Obviously period re-enactors were used and their dedication to the hobby shows in the correct formations, drills, etc.  The brief skirmish at the beginning with the British probably did not happen so close to the Delaware like that.  Also, the uniforms for the British appear off somehow.  They look like an earlier period, not the 1770s.  Still, it works.  The Hessians are well portrayed, although it would have provided variety if some Musketeer's with their tri-corn hats were shown.  Not all of Rall's men were Grenadiers and Fusiliers!

American losses were actually 2 dead from the march, and 4 wounded from the fight, including Hamilton and Monroe, the latter a future US President!  I don't know why the movie did not convey this.  The effects of Knox's artillery seems also much exaggerated.  Solid shot and cannister was used, not explosive shells as shown here.  Most films on this period fail to show artillery accurately in that regard.  Still, the acting and mood of the film are right on the mark which makes it easily the best Rev War production out there. Too bad it did not go further to show Washy's next great triumph at Princeton where a small British detachment gave him a much harder run for his money.  Still, what we have here is a nice concise work that comes close to converying the actual history of the event.  This is more than most Hollywood productions do these days.

Even though I knew the outcome, I found myself concerned about the ultimate success of the mission.  That being said, the portrayal of Henry Knox does a diservice to the father of American artillery.  While John Glover and his men did yeomens'work during the crossing, Knox commanded the operation.  It was through his efforts as a leader, working in concert with Glover, that the Americans succeeded in their task. The movie disparages his achievement for comedic effect.  Overall, I recommend this film, but watch it after reading David Hackett Fischer's ""Washington's Crossing"" or David McCullough's ""1776"".",1156723200,28,854,5.288888888888889
5488,5,0767023765,"Unlike The Patriot which was purely made for propaganda purposes, The Crossing, follows a much more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the American War of Independence (1775-1783).  The film brings to the screen George Washington's first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.

It is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?

The Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:

We get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).

Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.

The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral's sword sent to Congress).

There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals ""alive,"" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.

Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden ""under the carpet.""

As a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of ""patriotism.""

The only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.

As for the end where it states that: ""The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.""  That should be ""...to fight the rebel colonists,"" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each, of the total colonist populace.

In short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.

Strongly recommended, especially for History buffs, along with Revolution starring Al Pacino, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer. 4.5 Stars",1153353600,2,3957,5.257142857142857

5490,5,0767023765,"There is an old debate as to which is truer: history or poetry.

The accuracy is surprising, considering that it was adapted from a novel written by an author who generally knows better than to let history get in the way of a good story. In this case, the bending of the facts, mostly in characterization of some of Washington's generals, was relatively restrained, and supplied conflict that was real, if not always attributed to the correct historical person. Thus, the literary license does not get much in the way of history. Many of the small details are correct to an exceptional degree. All the characters, whether historically accurate or not, are well portrayed as people of the time. There is enormous subtlety here.

This is a magnificent expression of the American situation at the time and place.

Now there are only 3,000, most of them unfit for duty, and the British Army is snapping at your heels. In front of the men you still command is the Delaware River, a treacherous river at the best of times and even more dangerous at this time of year. Behind you are the British, so confident of victory that they leave a token force of Hessien mercenaries in Trenton, New Jersey and return to New York for the winter. After all, once the river freezes over, the British Army will march across the ice and hand you the terms of surrender. Your men are ill. Two of your generals are missing, there is no food, no medicine and no shelter. The men's enlistments are over on the 31st of December. You must face reality; the revolution to separate the American colonies has failed. That is what General George Washington faced in December, 1776. Any reasonable man would have surrendered but, as Washington stated, ""I am not a reasonable man."" and, being unreasonable, he does what no one believes possible, he decides to attack the Hessians on Christmas day.

That is what we learn when we study American History. What we do not learn is the true character of the man known as the Father of His Country. A man who was racked with guilt, doubt, and the belief that it is his fault that the American revolution is failing. A man who swears at officers who stay inside and enjoy the warmth of a fire while their men wait in the snow for their turn to get into the boats which will ferry them across the Delaware to New Jersey. A man willing to risk it all to achieve his dream of an independant America.

Yes, there are some mistakes in historial accuracy. General Knox and General Nathanael (Yes,I spelled his name correctly) Greene are portrayed by men older than they were when this battle took place. The members of British Army, seen in the first few minutes of this two hour movie, are wearing the uniforms use in the French and Indian Wars rather than those worn during the American Revolution, and Colonel John Glover's New England accent could use some work but, in my opinion, these minor inaccuracies are just that, minor. The strong language used is accurate for the time period, a fact many Americans do not know.

The words, I am guessing, were placed there to help the viewer understand the desperation of the situation, but unfortunately, this made the movie unviewable for my classroom.

With regards to the movie's overall impression; Jeff Daniels does an admirable job as George Washington and projects a very convincing presence.  You are witness to a man who has been beaten and defeated in every battle and skirmish for the last 18 months, and Daniels denotes this very well in his body language and demeanor.  Many of the men who would become his original cabinet are also seen (Hamilton, Knox) by his side in this story.

However, the story is well scripted for supporting roles as well and brings home to a modern audience a sense of the true leadership skills and vision that Washington must have had to keep up under such adversity.

While some may quibble with the historical accuracy (which in these adaptations there is always something missing that someone doesn't like) it does show the desperation of the forces in the winter of 1776 and how this small victory began to help turn things around in the ""rebels"" favor.  As others have stated Jeff Daniels plays an outstanding George Washington (better than Kelsey Grammar IMHO).  While I think the roles of Knox (at least they got an overweight actor albiet one that is about 15 years older than Knox was at the time) and Greene (also too old for the real Greene) were miscast the rest were fairly well portrayed.  Yes, it would have added to the story to show Rall putting away the note informing him of the  Continental  advance, it's something that isn't really missed (again IMHO).  There are also many historians who quibble over whether or not the Hessians were somewhat hung over or not which was somewhat implied but not shown.  The music does add to the story as others have mentioned.  I show this to my middle school students every year and they seem to enjoy it (it also gives them the opportunity to find the truth vs. fiction in the movie).",1121644800,10,1244,4.5675675675675675

This movie depicts an event in American History that needed to be told in detail. Many people are familiar with Washington's infamous crossing of the Delaware River, but do not realize how important of a mission it was. And to what degree of deterioration Washington's army was by the end of 1776. It was literally ""Victory or Death"" for Washington in the final week of the year. His troops enlistment's were almost up, moral was low and Washington desperately needed a victory. So he decided to attack a group of German troops (hired by the British)stationed in Trenton NJ the day after Christmas. Needless to say, the mission was accomplished...

My only complaint about The Crossing was that German leader Colonel Rall was given a message late in the evening on Christmas Day, warning him of the attack . Rall requested not to be disturbed and refused to read the message. He tucked the unread message in his coat pocket. The message was finally read the following day AFTER the attack. This incident was left out of the movie and really needed to be included.  For if Rall had read the letter, he would have been prepared for Washington's attack.

5501,5,0767023765,"Every American should see this film.  They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.
I have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain ""toughness.""  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.
As you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.
If you are interested get Howard Fast's ""The Unvanguished.""  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .

5509,4,0767023765,"This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.
I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.
But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.
Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.
Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.",1032566400,20,2162,4.795148247978437

Starring Jeff Daniels as General Washington, this film brings an important episode in American history vividly to life.  We see the broken remnants of the Continental army as it races to avoid capture following their defeats in New York.  The British, close on the heels of the retreating rebels, have written the Americans off as being on the verge of total surrender. Washington, tired and beaten, realizes that he must make one last attempt to achieve victory or all hope for the revolution will be lost.  Against the judgement of his officers, Washington prepares to launch a desperate offensive against a large force of Hessian troops occupying the town of Trenton, just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. The future of the new United States hangs in the balance as the rag-tag army bets all or nothing on this dangerous gamble.

Pulp fiction? Historical fact??
This little gem captures the essence of what many military historians believe to be the most daring battle strategy ever undertaken.
All the cast members deliver solid and convincing performances, especially Jeff Daniels as the brooding and short-tempered George Washington. Although, a couple of the scenes do contain minor historical flaws, even the purist cannot question the overall accuracy of the events unfolding. The sets, period costumes, and battle scenes are accurate even if some of the fight sequences are a bit exaggerated. Robert Harmon's direction is tight, and the photography by Rene Ohashi makes you feel that you are actually there. Gary Chang's music is also very effective in setting the mood for this non-epic film.
This movie is not your typical adulterated hollywood production that plays foot-loose with the facts. It stays on it's historical course as it tells the story of a near-miraculous event that was to become the turning-point of the American Revolution.

This video shows the conditions of the army and the struggles they had to reach FREEDOM!!Everything about this video is correct except for 2 minor parts when Glover i.e. Sebastian Roche  ""We'll give them cold steel."" Steel was not discovered yet. Also when Washintong layed on the bed flat on his back, people back then didn't sleep like that because they'll think you get this sickness or something. Jeff Daniels portrays an excellent George Washington who had a line or two that made me and my class crack up like crazy. Though some of the language is funny, it doesn't make a difference. The only part I have to cover my eyes is when Alexander Hamilton i.e. Steven McCarthy and Williams go into this house and kills 4 Hessians. It was pretty bloody, since friends described it to me. Overall its cool and this video inspired me to do a Social Studies project on the Battle of Trenton, which I won Honorable Mention. Hehe! Here is what I think of the actors:
Jeff Daniels~ he makes a great Washington and its hard to portray Father of Our Country
Sebastian Roche ~ his atitude is really funny in my point of view for Glover, cause Glover is well a thorn to Washington's side...
Roger Rees~ a very convincing Hugh Mercer. He looks a like real loyal friend to Washington.
Steven McCarthy ~ makes a cool young Cap. Alex Hamilton. It looked like his only job was to follow Washington's commands and give the time. Hehe....

Based on my somewhat limited reading (Richard Kethchum's ""The Winter Soldiers""), this movie delivers reasonably well. More so, the most truly important aspect of history movies, in my opinion, is the context and how well this given period is presented...in essence, how deeply does the viewer feel involved? This is the issue that makes this movie stand out. Watching this, I felt all the emotions that Washington appeared to go through (desperation, frustration, exhileration upon smashing the Hessians at Trenton...) and just  marveled at the ""period"" depiction. I really felt that this was what it was like in 1776 Pennsylvania and New Jersey (volunteers with no uniforms or warm clothes...some even without shoes in the dead of winter...). Washington's character was well played by Jeff Daniels as he portrayed the important leadership qualities that made him a legend and founding father. Daniels ""playing"" Washington also managed to come across as somewhat flawed (i.e. ""human""...) while giving a semblance of Washington's major desperation. On the negative side, I'm not so sure that Colonel Glover's role was historically accurate, although it was also well acted.

5517,4,0767023765,"I often show ""The Crossing"" to my political science classes and invariably they are enthralled.  It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.
Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.
The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.
James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&E production well worth seeing.",1001462400,8,1814,5.023333333333333
5518,5,0767023765,"It is very difficult to translate history to modern audiences. People of the past do not speak the same cultural language as modern Americans, or, to be more precise, modern Americans have difficulty understanding the motivations of their countrymen of 50, or 100, or 200 years ago.
""The Crossing"" is an excellent film. I mean that it excels in many respects, but not all. When I first heard that Jeff Daniels, of ""Dumb and Dumber"" infamy, was to play Washington, I slapped my forehead and groaned for history. Hollywood, once again, I thought, would fabricate history--replete with [standard] characters, stooges, faithful sidekicks and villainous bad guys (ala ""The Patriot"")--rather than make an honest attempt at what we know as the facts.
I was wrong. Howard Fast wrote the novel and the screenplay. He is the same fellow who gave us ""April Morning"" and ""Citizen Tom Paine"", among other fiction classics of America's early Revolutionary history. Fast became a socialist, but always revered the spirit and determination of the Founders, which, perhaps, is why he became a socialist. I do not agree with his later political leanings, but I share his respect for the revolutionaries who made America and know we would share a hatred of the tyranny they opposed.
Is this film flawed? It certainly is to the extent noted [....] The screenplay is not accurate in many particulars (Fast was not fastidious in this regard). However, it captures as few films have the spirit of the Revolution, the desperation of the times and the greatness of Washington. Daniels did a superb job, with the strong script, of showing why Washington was the leader he was.
This is an entertaining and informative film for adults, but I think its chief value is as an excellent introduction to America's first hero and the long odds against which the people who made America labored. Their success was a miracle.
If you are looking for a good film to excite your kids about America and her beginnings, pull out a map, show them the Delaware River and ""Washington's Crossing"" just north of Philadelphia and watch ""The Crossing"" with them.",994982400,37,2114,4.941011235955056

5520,5,0767023765,"The Crossing is about a small action that became a pivotal point in the American Revolution, the American assault on German mercinary troops in Trenton, NJ.  What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.

Jeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington's troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.

This film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington's command is well done. The state of mind of Washington's troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.

In all, I found this one of the best films about Washington's attack on Trenton and one that gives a new impression of the compexity in executing this battle.  This film should be in the library of every person with an interst in early America.",993600000,9,1934,4.780120481927711

Any history buff will love this film - that's why I bought it after I saw it on TV.",975369600,,403,4.315789473684211
5523,5,0767023765,It's rare you find a movie that's not only educational but entertaining as well.  And I'm not a person who usually watches educational films.  This movie was different.  Gripping and fascinating from start to finish.  This should be REQUIRED watching for all school children!  This movie brings history to life like few others EVER have for me.  My knowledge of Washington crossing the Delaware started and ended with the famous painting.  Now I know the incredible story behind it.  Highly entertaing - and Jeff Daniels makes a wonderful Washington.,973036800,5,550,5.101123595505618
5524,5,0767023765,"This movie, telling the story of Washington's crossing the Delaware in December 1776, is based on the book by Howard Fast. It gives a vivid picture of the trials of the early period of the Revolutionary War endured by Washington and the men who followed him. Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Washington is gripping. Sebastian Roche as Col. Glover is wonderful. The rest of the cast were well chosen.
One of the most charming scenes is between two of the common soldiers trying to stay warm and dry in a small tent. They discuss the merits of smoking corn silk vs. cow dung in their clay pipes. They are very young and very human
Anyone interested in the history of the Revolutionary War will find that this movie brings the struggle alive, depicting the officers and soldiers as men. The Hessians may be depicted as too mean, but the conversation between their commander, who expresses concern for the treatment of his men, and Washington is touching. This movie ranks with ""Gettysburg"" in its depiction of war in an earlier era.",969062400,6,1023,4.720670391061453
5525,5,0767023765,"This movie, although made for cable, had the drama of a feature motion picture.  Jeff Daniels and the rest of the supporting cast gave outstanding  performances.  This movie has the ability to make you laugh, cry and cheer.  I strongly recomend it, not for it's perfect historical portrayal, but  rather it's telling of history in an accurate, yet entertaining way.  I  wish all American Revolution movies were done so well.",966988800,2,424,4.9714285714285715
5526,3,0767023765,"Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in American history.  Nevertheless, a few of the liberties taken with the characters and historical inaccuracies are too much to warrant a  5-star rating.
Here are just three examples:
1. Washington's Language -  Although Jeff Daniels's portrayal of Washington as a hot-tempered,  foul-mouthed, flawed hero appeals to our modern cynicism and desire to  debunk the myths behind our heroes, there are some serious questions as to  the film's accuracy on this front.  George Washington did have a volcanic  temper, but he had learned to control it - and that was part of the  strength of his character.  The movie depicts him as being almost  constantly frustrated and bordering on an outburst.  This does not reflect  the truth as can be evidenced by the reaction many of Washington's  subordinates had on those RARE occasions when Washington did lose his cool.  Were he as temperamental as Daniels portrays him, the outbursts Washington  DID have wouldn't have been as significant to those around him as they  were.  In addition, the language attributed to Washington in this film is  in direct contrast with Washington's own orders against cursing.  I don't  question the fact that a few words may have slipped now and then, but it's  very inconsistent with the historical record to portray Washington as  foul-mouthed as this film does.
2. Alexander Hamilton was not  Washington's aide at the Battle of Trenton.  He was an artillery captain.  He did not come into Washington's service until later.
3. The exchange  between Horatio Gates and Washington was clearly overblown for dramatic  effect.  It's no secret that the two didn't like each other, but there's no  evidence to support the film's contention that Washington threatened to  have Gates shot.
I don't want my criticisms to make it seem like the  movie had no merit.  Howard Fast and the film's production team do an  outstanding job in showing just how desperate the American situation was  prior to Trenton.  For this alone, the movie is well worth watching.",961545600,21,2100,5.038011695906433
5527,5,0767023765,"I loved this movie.  Jeff Daniels gave a brilliant depiction of a young General Washington.  To truly succeed in our future, we must understand our past.  This movie will enable you to have a glimpse of our country's humble  beginnings.",959817600,2,236,4.825
5528,5,0767023765,"In the last 10 years or so, Hollywood and cable TV has finally started to get it right when they make movies (Widescreen or TV) about historical events, and The Crossing is no exception.
This is a well acted account  of one of the major events of the War of Independence.  Jeff Daniels  portrays a superb George Washington, who was at times very impatient and  hot tempered.  History seems to gloss over the imperfections and  vulnerabilities of our nations beloved figures, however this movie shows  Washington to be flawed and tired at times like the rest of his army  was.
The uniforms,locations, and camp life were accurate as well as the  filth and harsh existence the Continental Army had to go through.  The  movie did an excellent job of trying to film the famous battle, which  definitely caught the Hessians by suprise.
Overall, a well acted,  accurately portrayed Revolutionary War movie.",954288000,57,899,4.874172185430464

7788712,5,0767023765,"This is an excellent, yet concise film from the Arts and Entertainment channel depicting one of the most crucial moments of the American Revolution.  On December 25, 1776, General Washington led his troops in a bold maneuver to cross the icy Delaware River from Pennsylvania into New Jersey.  The following morning, his troops marched ten miles to Trenton, and proceeded to shock and rout British hired guns known as Hessians.  The stunning surprise victory occurred just as the enlistments of many of Washington's men were winding down and the American army bordered on virtual dissolution.  The morale boost bolstered American spirits to continue on with the struggle for independence.  Jeff Daniels, often known for offbeat roles and comedies, is convincing as the at times stoic and at other times explosive Father of our country.",1515456000,,834,5.1940298507462686
