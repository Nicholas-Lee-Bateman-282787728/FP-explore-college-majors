7886741,5,6305272719,"I had the VHS version and liked it, so I went ahead and bought the updated DVD.  It was well worth it.  The DVD version has a lot of new footage, including some of Reagan's most famous speeches (""A Time for Choosing"" and the speech after the air traffic controllers went on strike are classics).  I've seen a lot of Reagan videos, but this one by far is the most comprehensive.  It has everything.  And the new DVD features are great, too.  If you can only buy one Reagan video, this is the one.",1059004800,14,495,4.212765957446808
7886742,5,6305272719,"Ronald Reagan was a great American, and this video is a worthy tribute to this heroic figure.  The program extensively covers the former President's life, including several in-depth interviews with White House insiders.  If  you're looking for a video that is both entertaining and informative, look  no further.",957830400,8,312,5.4375
7886743,5,6305272719,"Ronald Reagan did save our lives and the sole fact that we work, leave and sleep peacefuly, is the result of his vision and the style of leadership. He brought our dreams to life by his arrogance and strong belief in future  and democracy. This video will tell and remind us again that He did act and  while acting he never gave up thinking about the people around the world.  Let us wish Gipper all the best for the remainder of his glorious life!",938217600,12,448,4.309523809523809
