8452145,5,B0050ZSHIC,"I was AMAZED at how good this movie was, and doubly amazed when I listened to the commentary by the creators of how they achieved such amazing effects on such a small budget.  These people must be the most resourceful creative professionals on the planet. They made every nuance count.  No effect, direct or subliminal, was left to chance;  everything was purposeful, to create a specific impression as they lead the viewer deeper into this story.

And Abby Mittel...THAT girl is an extremely talented actress who pulls off this challenging role flawlessly.  It is a no-brainer that we will see more of her in the future.  Everybody should buy this movie just to say that you own one of the ""early Abby Mittel flicks"".  Get it for the resale value alone:  seriously, collectors will be rabid to buy these up ten years from now. (And remember, you heard that from ME!):^)

The story was good and the suspense was genuine (not that I'm going to spoil anything for you, but let's just say that what's really going on isn't obvious from the beginning.) I loved how the sequence of events leads the viewer into this delightful ambivalent tension about Abby's co-star character, played by Richard Gunn.  Is he a good guy?  A bad guy?  Is he up to something?  You'll change your mind about him a dozen times and love every minute of it.

This is certainly somewhat of a ""horror"" movie, but it has a strong plot and enough substance to satisfy a wide range of viewers without needing to resort to cheesy-looking gore. The acting is consistently suburb from Mittel, her co-star Richard Gunn (who was a character on the series ""Dexter"") and the rest of the cast.  Fugue is a well-done, riveting movie, well worth the price.",1334534400,,1713,4.663333333333333
