4621039,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Margaret Thatcher acquired the sobriquet, the ""Iron Lady"", from the Soviet Union.  It was meant to be disparaging.  She regarded it as a compliment.

""The Iron Lady"" provides a biography of Margaret Thatcher's adult life.  The highlight of this life, of course, was her more than a decade a Britain's first female prime minister.  The film covers this as a series of flash backs as seen the through the eyes of a very aged former prime minister.  The technique works.  Her life has certainly been quite extraordinary although there is little focus on her weaknesses.  In this sense, the film almost becomes hagiography.

Notwithstanding the apparent lack of blemishes in the character of the former prime minister, Meryl Streep, in playing the older Margaret Thatcher, is spell binding.  Moreover, Streep is simply magnificent. Her performance is my early call for an Oscar. She really does become Margaret Thatcher.  There are no apparent flaws.  The accent, in particular, is right on the money.

Streep is supported by Jim Broadbent as Dennis.  Unfortunately, his role tends to fall almost to caricature at times.  This is a shame as there are a number of other cameo roles and most of these are played excellently.  Michael Foot, Geoffrey Howe, Michael Heseltine, et al are played in absolutely convincing style by a great supporting cast.  The various sets and the manner in which the era of the 1980s is re-created is also first class.

In sum, apart from the danger of hagiography, this is a great film led by an actress at the top of her form.  Recommended.",1324944000,18,1565,4.88212927756654
4621040,4,B0059XTUXQ,"I saw The Iron Lady right before it was widely released, and felt that expectations that Meryl Streep's performance would be incredible were fully justified.  Having seen her in many roles, this was not surprising--she's widely regarded as one of the greatest living actresses--but her transformation here into an elderly woman, including the accent, the makeup, the attitudes and personality, is nothing short of astonishing.  Thatcher's very conservative politics and abrasive manner are of course very controversial--and this portrayal of them is very timely.  To be sure, if you're very sympathetic to Thatcher's politics, you may find this portrayal of her unsympathetic or even offensive; some clearly have. But regardless of the viewer's politics, I can't imagine anyone watching this and not feeling he or she has seen something remarkable.

The story of Thatcher's life is told through a series of flashbacks experienced by the woman long after she left office as the British prime minister with the longest tenure of the 20th century, and its first woman PM.  We see how she entered politics, met her husband, rose to power, earned the Iron Lady nickname, and was pushed from office by her own party.  For those unfamiliar with her life and politics, it's educational, at least superficially.  An attempt is made to deviate from the straightforward biopic format by having Thatcher's mind failing during her old age, resulting in hallucinations about her deceased husband punctuating the film.  This device is effective, but still, this is not a great film. It's a not-quite-conventional movie about the life of one historical figure, made interesting primarily by Streep's stunning ability to inhabit her subject, and thereby not only cause us to appreciate Streep's art, but also feel at least a little compassion for an aging woman no longer in power.",1324425600,162,1864,5.231543624161074

4621085,1,B0059XTUXQ,"I really did not like this movie. I thought that it was poorly done. They seemed to focus solely on her mental health issues and her failures rather than all of her astounding accomplishments. Very sad. Meryl Streep is a fantastic actress, but she is also extremely liberal. This may have influenced her portrayal of the extremely conservative Margaret Thatcher....at least that is what seems to have happened. If you watch the movie, decide for yourself.

4621186,1,B0059XTUXQ,"I was so disappointed by this movie, as it was a lost opportunity to tell a great story. Most of the time is wasted on showing a senile old Margaret Thatcher bumbling around her apartment with hallucinations of her late husband and flashbacks of her life. There is very little context given around the events she dealt with, why they happened, and how the outcome did or did not improve things. Most viewers under 45 years of age won't be old enough to remember these events to have any of that context. It is disgraceful that the portrayal of a strong woman has to focus on her senile old years at the cost of the impactful ones. Meryl Streep did a wonderful job as usual and her performance gets 5 stars. I hope that someday someone will actually tell this story properly.",1487462400,12,774,4.457746478873239

While I know your views differ wildly from Mrs. Thatcher, you magnificently re-created who she was down to the tiniest voice inflection. As someone who has closely studied and admired MT, it was truly a joy to watch her visage so powerfully portrayed within you.

To whoever wrote this script, you EPICALLY and TRAGICALLY failed. You had a fantastic subject matter (Margaret Thatcher) and subject (Meryl Streep) and yet you couldn't craft anything to do them justice. It wasn't just the fixation on her alleged dimentia-riden later years (We get it- getting older is harder for EVERYONE) it was the complete repudiation of what made Margaret Thatcher so exceptional for her era. Yes, she had her moments of intransigence, but MT was also an unparalleled dynamo of principle and vision. You didn't even try to touch on this magnitude, and it makes me sad. I finished this film feeling disappointed that such a perfect opportunity had been wasted.

4621468,5,B0059XTUXQ,"I know that this review had pretty awful ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Perhaps it's my age- I'm 29 and not British. I was not alive for any of Thatcher's rule as Prime Minister and Iron Lady was my first impression of the hard- headed and non- sympathetic first female BPM.

With that being said, I got more from this movie than anything I have seen in several years. Meryl Streep's acting was spot on and brilliant, no one can deny that. But the screen writing and plot were completely under-rated. There were so many elements and layers in this movie that went beyond Thatcher's rule and served a great deal of heart and soul to the audience.

I don't want to give any spoilers away because that will completely take away fron the movie, but if you have ever loved and lost someone or loved and are afraid of losing, this film will hot home... hard. This movie remind everyone to live in the now and do what makes you happy and feel love. The end of the movie left both me and my fiance in tears. In fact, this was the first time I had ever seen my fiance cry, so it was actually very special. He cried for over an hour.

The movie wasn't actually all sad like you might think after both of us tearing up like fools. It wasn't the storyline or the horrible things that happened in Britian or even Thatcher's resilience. This was what the movie intended to do- make a movie about Thatcher that makes people feel inspired. That is exactly what this movie did.",1462579200,,1457,4.349264705882353

What you will see is her as a senile old lady having a lot of flashbacks, mentally interacting with her deceased husband, and really interacting with her surviving relatives.

There are a few short flashbacks of her life and political career beforehand, but not enough to make the viewer learn much about her. You see her surviving the bombing of Britain, the fact that she is a grocer's daughter, bits of her romance with her future husband, her going into the men's world of politics, her becoming Prime Minister against expectations, and major scenes from that era, such as her economic policies, the Falklands War, and the end of the Cold War. But those are all barely covered, and you don't learn about her education or how she formed the political views she did, or what effect her policies had, good or bad.

4621653,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep is one of the world's finest film, television and stage actresses. She is incomparable as an actress. She has mastered all genres of acting and has plenty of accolades among them. Phyllida Lloyd and Streep have collaborated before in the light hearted ""Mamma Mia."" They have come together and have successfully given a biography film of Britain's first female prime minister Margaret Thatcher. This film covers her life with Streep from 1974 and to her older years suffering from old age and dementia. They have a younger actress, Alexandra Roach, playing a younger Margaret Thatcher. There are two actors playing young and older Denis. Jim Broadbent is magical as older Denis. Harry Lloyd does a sufficient job in playing young Denis.

The film has issues mostly about the screenplay. Rest assured, Streep performs a masterclass in acting. She could perform solo in this role. Her performance as MT (Denis's pet name for his wife) is so brilliant in appearance and display. When I saw her perform as Julia Child, I thought that Streep should have won the Academy Award then and there. Streep didn't win then and there. She came back stronger and personified another strong feminist icon.

Jim Broadbent should have been nominated for best supporting actor. The cast of actors reads like the A-list of the West End and the Royal Shakespeare Company. You couldn't get a better cast.

The DVD includes a fifteen minutes feature of making the movie; the younger Margaret; Denis; the costumes and pearls; and history feature of films for 2011 incorporating this film; ""W.E.;"" ""Coriolanus;"" ""My Week with Marilyn;"" and ""The Artist.""

4621657,4,B0059XTUXQ,"*To be Clear, I'm reviewing the standard DVD edition*

""The Iron Lady"" is a film depicting Britain's first, and thus far only, female Prime Minister (and the longest serving one, at that).  But by no means is this a typical ""bio-pic"".  In fact, it was this point that I had problems with, initially.  I was expecting to watch Margaret's ascension and fall in detail.  But that was not to be.  I almost decided to turn the film off...but decided against it.  Instead, I abandoned my expectations and approached the movie on its terms.  In the end, I found a truly inspiring film that provided a very valid and important angle of approach that is rarely ever taken with historical figures.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Honestly, there isn't really any issues.  No sex or innuendos.  There are some expletives (especially of the British bent) thrown around, but it never seemed overused.  The only thing worth noting is that after the British victory of the Falkland Islands various historical primary source clips of the celebration are shown including two bare breasted women celebrating.

UNDERSTANDING THIS FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO RELEVANT PLOT SPOILERS EXCEPT FOR ONE VERY VERY MINOR PLOT POINT REVEALED IN THE FIRST 8-10 MINUTES OF THE FILM):
So, the thing about this film is, though it is a depiction of a powerful historical figure, it is not a bio-pic in the usual sense.  And I think it's very important to understand this point to truly enjoy it.  The main set up is we are introduced to an older Margaret Thatcher already old and way past her days as Prime Minister.  And she is suffering from something very similar to dementia.  As she leaves her now ""normal"" day to day life, various things happen that trigger flashbacks to important moments in her life and career.  Also, her hallucinations of her husband keep popping up guiding her through her struggle to reclaim her mind and make sense of her place in life (outside of flashbacks when he's really alive, of course).

If you want a docu-drama, this is so not it.  But this film places a very important focus that we would do well to consider, the emotions of Margaret Thatcher.  Honestly, this film really well captured the character and emotional battlefield that this woman had to struggle with.  And in that, it truly showed a woman of conviction and British pride.  A Soviet Journalist called her ""The Iron Lady"", and through this choice of focus, you really see in an inspiring and surprisingly relatable way why she earned it.

Oh, and a special note to the inclusion of Margaret Thatcher's husband.  Though the decision to make significant use of him as a ""ghost/hallucination"" sounds hokey on paper, it was a brilliant move.  Besides the flashbacks, the hallucinations really revealed to us in many ways the kind of man Denis Thatcher was.  He was often in the background in public life, but he served such an important role in helping Margaret pull through an otherwise vicious career brining common sense, humor, and just plain compassion.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Honestly, not much, there's a 12 minute mini-doc about the making of the film which, though not very focused, was still very insightful.  There's also an 18 minute documentary about film portrayals of historical figures which was also a delight.  The addition 2-minute docs were really pointless as they were just rehashes of the 12 minute mini-doc I mentioned above...well, all except one.  The 2-minute documentary on the costuming decisions was surprisingly intriguing and brings an even deeper (almost poetic) understanding to the film.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a wonderfully inspiring film that doesn't detail this resolute woman's life so much as it explores her psyche.  Regardless of your view  on her politics, she is still a woman to be admired, respected, and even followed as her example is peerless.",1444780800,,3828,4.902021772939347

4621690,4,B0059XTUXQ,"The Iron Lady is a biographical film based on the life of Margaret Thatcher,who is portrayed primarily by Meryl Streep. In her formative and early political years,she was played by Alexandra Roach.

The film is an intimate portrait of Margaret Thatcher, the first and only female Prime Minister of The United Kingdom. It begins in 2008 with an elderly Lady Margaret Thatcher buying milk unrecognized by other customers and walking back from the shop alone. Over the course of three days we see her struggle with dementia and with the lack of power that comes with old age, while looking back on defining moments of her personal and professional life, on which she reminisces with her late husband,Denis Thatcher. She is shown as having difficulty distinguishing between the past and present. A theme throughout the film is the personal price which Thatcher has paid for power.

Streep's performance is so true and so uncannily accurate for she so full and so complete in its understanding. In short, she is fascinating every second she is on screen. Unfortunately,the filmmakers haven't come to any conclusion about Thatcher or what message they want to bring on screen. In fact,they don't even know what to focus about her. Too bad that Streep's portrayal is squandered as the screenplay is somewhat written all over the place that it negates whatever impact nor accomplishment Thatcher has achieved in her lifetime.",1438819200,,1417,5.051282051282051

4621812,5,B0059XTUXQ,"The key to appreciating ""The Iron Lady"" is understanding what you are about to undertake before you watch it. Those looking for a straightforward biography of Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will be disappointed: those looking to understand her final years and how mental affliction can ravish the mightiest of us should find the movie well done and poignant.  Don't expect focus on Thatcher's politics or career. ""The Iron Lady"" is, rather, an examination of the humanity of a bigger-than-life figure in the loneliness of her final years.  Meryl Streep is superb in portraying Thatcher in the throes of her physical and mental decline.  She even accomplishes speaking with an amazing similarity to Thatcher's voice and inflections. Thatcher's later life is haunted by hallucinations, yet there are scenes where she still bursts forth with flashes of brilliance and coherence.  The scenes depicting her dinner at home with old colleagues and during which she is examined by her doctor are examples. At such times, those around her who have become accustomed to her feeble-mindedness are left speechless. Streep plays these scenes with all the feistiness and sharpness of her real life subject. On the whole, this film treats Thatcher's vulnerabilities with dignity. The film editing is somewhat jarring, which complements the unsettling thread running through it, such as in several scenes shot at somewhat disturbingly oblique angles. Despite ""The Iron Lady's"" focus on Thatcher's end of life decline, we still come away with an understanding that she was an extraordinary woman, both despised and revered, and a legend for all times.",1429488000,,1643,5.3076923076923075

presence of Ronald Reagan should have been brought into the film however, as they were goof friends and worked well together.  Here, Reagan is seen only in a brief newsreel flash.  This exclusion does take away much from the film.  However, it is still a reasonably good film and worth watching.  The fantasy-scene flashbacks may prove confusing to some viewers.  Here, it is a matter of individual taste and perception.  Good film.

4621844,5,B0059XTUXQ,I bought this movie for my Mom and she loved it. I personally hated the bitch and I think she ought to hang next to George Bush.,1425945600,,128,3.7777777777777777
4621845,2,B0059XTUXQ,"I'll admit - I was a little lost with this movie. On the one hand I thought this was a brilliant portrayal of an elderly woman with dementia who is reflecting on her life, but on the other hand, as a biography of an actual person it came up really short. I got bits and flashes of significant events, but I didn't actually get a sense of who Margaret Thatcher was or how she shaped history.

Although I was born in 1977 and grew up in the Reagan years, I don't actually know much about Margaret Thatcher - and after seeing this movie, I still don't. There was just too much history and too many events that were quickly glossed over, and most of the time I felt like I was missing something. The first time an event went by, I jotted it down thinking I'd look it up when the movie was over. The problem was that by the time the movie ended I had an entire page of stuff to google! So as a biography, it left me a little frustrated and lost.

But if you look at this film as a character study of an elderly person with dementia, it's brilliant. I have no idea if Meryl Streep gave an accurate portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, but she DID give an amazing performance of a woman dealing with the loss of her husband and her fears of ""going mad"" as her memory fails her. As a character study, it was fascinating and very moving. The scenes where Meryl played the elderly version of Thatcher were so tender and so intimate that I was simply spellbound. Meryl Streep is undoubtedly in a league of her own, and she didn't disappoint in this movie.

So I came away with mixed feelings about this film. As a biographical movie about Margaret Thatcher I'd give it 2 or 3 stars. Maybe more if you have a good understanding of her life already. But if you set aside the historical & biographical aspects and see the film as one woman's memoirs or a fictional character study, then it's outstanding (mainly due to the power of Streep's performance).

So I averaged it out at 4 stars. The acting was top-notch and the flashback approach was well done - it made me ""feel"" and experience the dementia, which was very effective. While I was felt a little lost with the historical events taking place, the movie did hold my attention throughout and I was never bored. Overall, it's well worth seeing, but only if you aren't expecting a biography of a real person.

**UPDATE - I've done a little reading since posting this review, and I was shocked to learn that Thatcher was still alive when this movie came out. For some reason I just assumed she had already passed away. Now I'm INTENSELY uncomfortable at having seen this movie. It's one thing to portray someone with dementia, it's entirely another to broadcast the private and personal struggles of a REAL person for the world to see - and to do so without their permission. I changed the rating to 2-stars because I'm angry at the way this movie made me feel - like I participated in something very, very wrong - a thousand times worse than peeking in someone's medicine cabinet.

I sincerely hope that Mrs. Thatcher or her family wasn't hurt or embarrassed by this film. There is NO shame in dementia AT ALL, but that doesn't mean that if it was my mom I would want a movie made of her wandering around confused and in her pj's, talking to my dead father. Alzheimer's is a subject that is too private, too personal, and too painful to be exploited by Hollywood. No matter what one's views are about Margaret Thatcher or her policies as Prime Minister, she was a human being who deserved to be treated with respect and dignity, and I'm not entirely sure this film did that.

I'm very sorry I saw this film.",1425772800,2,3643,4.396142433234421

How she continually inhabits the body and persona of the person she is depicting on screen is a supreme talent and most unusual.  As Margaret Thatcher she has, once again, given a stunning performance that has allowed us insights into this unique woman we hadn't known prior to this film. The film runs on parallel lines beginning with Thatcher as a much older woman who is now suffering dementia.  Contrasted against her younger self she weaves the Thatcher story into an amalgam of the total woman who became the first female Prime Minister of Britain.  We also, and at long last, develop a much clearer picture of her beloved husband, who stood by her at every turn of the journey and through the turmoil that was to define her time at the helm of one of the world's largest super powers.  Margaret Thatcher's life is one of great historical and personal interest and her story is told with a pathos not often afforded her legacy. Bravo!",1417996800,,1049,4.623655913978495

4621994,3,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep did an outstanding job as Margaret Thatcher.  She is a ""lefty"" American actress who gave a sympathetic and sometimes uncanny portrayal of a ""righty"" English politician.  Streep did an awesome job on getting the Thatcher voice right.  She may well be nominated for an Academy award.

The movie has some terrific highlights including the Falklands scenes, the scenes in Parliament and the scene with US Secretary of State Al Haig (""Shall I be mother?"" while offering to pour tea--my favorite line of the film).  Against the backdrop of contemporary US politics, it is hard not to long fruitlessly for the opportunity to cast a vote for a Thatcher-like candidate among politicians of all parties.

I remember living in Chelsea in 1970 as a boy and seeing the mounds of uncollected trash bags piled high on the sidewalks due to disruptive trade union activity.  My father, a television executive, would furtively take the trash out at night and sneak 8 blocs away to the Sloane Square tube stop to dispose of our trash.  During the holiday season one clever man carefully gift wrapped his trash and put it in the back seat of his unlocked car, sure in the knowledge that it would be stolen.  Iron Lady presents some of the incredible havoc that the trade unions visited upon the UK during the 1970's, including the horrors of the garbage strike.

The movie deserves much credit for simply taking the Thatcher phenomenon seriously.  She led Britain to victory in the Falklands, broke the backs of the trade unions, restored the British economy, dramatically increased the rate of home ownership, steered Britain clear of the Euro Chimera and was part of the triumvirate (along with Reagan and Pope John Paul) that won the cold war without firing a shot.  I am old enough to remember the joke told in the 1980's about how ""Thatcher knew so little about foreign policy that she thought that 'Sinai' was the plural of sinus.""  Much like Sarah Palin, (""I can see Russia from my porch"") she was fodder for television cartoon shows and West end productions like Billy Elliot.  This movie, at least, takes her with the seriousness that she deserves.

Sadly, the movie dwells far too long on Thatcher's alleged dementia.  Imagine if a Ronald Reagan biopic chose to focus primarily upon his post-Presidency battle with Alzheimer's.  Would Reagan idolaters or haters be satisfied with such a treatment?  This movie seems focus group generated in a most unfortunate manner.  ""We need to soften MT's acerbic personality by showing her vulnerabilities and playing up the love story.  This will be sure to attract the 35+ ladies who might buy a ticket.""

The highly fictionalized scenes with a deceased Dennis Thatcher, played by the very talented Jim Broadbent, detract from the film's credibility.  The repeated scenes of an angry mob attacking Thatcher's automobile are wholly invented as well.

The movie largely misses the opportunity to play on the tremendous drama of the Brighton conference bombing which nearly killed Thatcher.  Where is her business as usual speech that came one day after the IRA bombing attempt?  Her role in helping to win the cold war is very lightly glossed over.  The deployment of Pershing missiles in the UK was hugely controversial at the time.  She stood shoulder to shoulder with Reagan who is also given unaccountably short shrift in this account.  Her whole relationship with Reagan is depicted in one brief dance scene.

The movie's unforgivable sin is that it somehow manages to make Thatcher seem dull, when she was, in fact, anything but.

If you ever wondered why there are practically no garbage cans on the streets of London, this movie will lay it out for you.  Blame the bloody Irish and their infernal devices!

Polls suggest that Thatcher is today regarded as Britain's most popular prime minister with the sole exception of Winston Churchill.  The rise of a grocers's daughter from Grantham to this eminence in a male dominated world is tremendous dramatic raw material that was ill served by the producers of this film.  It could just have been so much better.

FALKLANDS POSTSCRIPT.  The Falklands war scenes of Iron Lady are an interesting reminder of that conflict.  In 1982 when the battle over Falklands Islands was being fought the UK possessed a credible military force that got the job done.  Some 28,000 men were dispatched an ocean away to deal with the ""Argies.""  The Royal navy had an aircraft carrier which proved essential air support in the conflict.  Fast forward to 2012, and the UK has no aircraft carrier (the mothballed Ark Royal is for sale on a version of E-bay) and won't for the next ten years.  In 1982 the war was fought over some barren, windswept, scarcely populated islands.  Today they have discovered offshore oil in the territorial waters off the Falklands.  There is now actually something there to fight over.  Is trouble again brewing in the South Atlantic?  Not to worry, the Brits have deal to borrow a carrier from the Frogs in a pinch!

Although Meryl had me captivated from beginning to end, I feel the producers had missed the boat by recording much trivia in place of much they could have shown about Maggie's remarkable career as Prime Minister, knowing they had this great actress who could perform it all to perfection. By so doing, the movie would have enjoyed greater mass appeal instead of appealing to the esoteric audiences such as us. When ""the lady is not for turning"" appears in the trailer but not in the actual movie, I call that an unforgivable call-bird.  Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses of all time who depicted Maggie to perfection with her identical speech idiom and accent which no English actress could equal.

4622080,2,B0059XTUXQ,"It's easy enough to disparage this movie as a hit job on Lady Margaret Thatcher. A few aspects suggest that the filmmakers may have wanted to be kind to her, but in a manner that would appeal to raving leftists.

The movie opens with the former Prime Minister as an addle-brained widow unable to remember important aspects of her life which changed in recent years. When a crisis is mentioned, this Thatcher immediately enunciates with the tone-of-voice of delivering a proclamation, and states as though a broad policy: ""We must release a statement, offering our condolences. We must never, ever, ever, give in to terrorists."" Her remark is a categorical one, one that fits decades-earlier situations just as it does the one playing out on her present-day television. While she had been watching, memories of decades-earlier events had flitted in and out as superimpositions upon the current scene, to communicate the elderly woman's recollections. Her mind comes across as deteriorating, and her ideas come off worse. The impression that the combination of scenes leaves is that Thatcher's policies had always been knee-jerk reactions, simple-minded responses to fit a category of problem, lacking in nuance. This does not serve well the legacy of the real former Prime Minister.

Scenes in which Thatcher seeks the position of Prime Minister and in which she serves more than a decade in that position, are more respectful of the achievement which Lady Thatcher reached, but even these scenes allow her historic importance to be undercut. The filmmakers seem to have decided that if they emphasize the obstacles to any woman being accorded the top position in Parliament, then the liberal audience will sympathize with the difficulties faced by a woman and might overlook that many people who would see this film disliked Thatcher's politics (or thought they were supposed to dislike them). The film seems to be saying: Go ahead, you can like her, because we're not asking you to like her even half-way.

The film panders to Thatcher's antagonists even by portraying her ascent in politics as a consequence of Thatcher submitting to image consultants who instruct her on expanding her appeal by changing how she delivers her messages. The audience of the movie has seen Thatcher as a young adult (played by Alexandra Roach; Meryl Streep plays her middle-aged and onward) speaking at high pitch as her normal tone. Now she is told that a calm, deep, projected voice will convey proper authority and rectitude. No doubt that the real Thatcher would have been coached to present herself in a way that would dispel citizens' doubts, but in a full life such hours would be of little importance. By including them in the screenplay, the writers permit viewers to form the impression that Thatcher was a product of manipulators rather than someone with convictions. The writers did allow for one of the voice consultants to say to Thatcher that the ideas she would express would be her own, that only the manner of presentation would be reshaped, but the one statement on this seems to be said as an afterthought.

The movie does provide some tantalizing quotes of Thatcher which speak of her honorable character and her devotion to principle, while providing also backstory to historic events. ""We will stand on principle ... or we will not stand at all,"" she says at one point. At another, she says: ""Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become your character. And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think, we become."" This much is good. However, the preceding statement continues with a further two sentences: ""My father always said that. And I think I am fine."" Thatcher's ideas being her father's is a point over-emphasized here. Elsewhere in the movie, Thatcher tells of her upbringing as a grocer's daughter having helped her develop a sense of how individuals properly trade; a scene of young Thatcher shows her mesmerized by her father speaking to a local council. This is a movie that too often hints that Lady Thatcher was merely a conduit for others' ideas. A viewer seeking to understand her uniqueness is bound to be disappointed. A movie which undertakes to portray a revered subject, and doesn't respect that subject, is what this movie is.

Side note on Meryl Streep's performance: as is her custom, Meryl Streep gives a masterful performance. There's a brief flash when the editors let her down, showing her eyes dart too quickly for the gently-measured pace established for the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher. For this one or two seconds, the real Streep comes through. It occurs sixty-three minutes into the film, as Streep's Thatcher stands at a podium delivering a speech.

She was a Lady, a philosopher, a stateswoman, a leader, and an entire Cheering Team for the world of free human beings.  She was a Lady with principles, a strong moral compass, and conviction.

Clearly Hollywood cherry-picked what they could stomach and went with that -- showing a conservative with dementia is right up their alley rather than telling the incredible story of this amazing woman's life or time in office.

Who ever wrote the script for this obviously DIDN'T WANT THE AUDIENCE TO LEARN ANYTHING USEFUL about this unique and controversial public figure. On top of that, a complete WAIST OF TALENT it was to cast this one-of-a-kind highly talented actress in such a POINTLESS ROLE as Margaret Thatcher.

4622342,1,B0059XTUXQ,"So okay, everyone says Streep's performance was great and it was.  She's fantastic.  However, even an actress of her stature and ability can't raise the Titanic.  Horrific dialogue, terrible editing, stupid camera shots that make absolutely no sense, quick cuts of scenes that make no sense whatsoever (Thatcher resigning and walking down an aisle of supporters spliced with quick shots of her feet walking through rose pedals . . ???!!??!!!???!. . . none of it was strung together in a way that told a cohesive story.  There is something to be said for using a stream of consciousness where the audience can follow the random thoughts of a character but certainly not for almost two hours and definitely not when you are trying to follow a story.  We are introduced to events and people that last seconds and quickly pass (a trusted member of team being bombed, for example); as a result, none of it has any meaning.

It might have been an interesting angle to see the character packing up her dead husband's things and recalling the major events of her life as she is trying to deal with both the ghosts of her past and the ghost of her husband.  But this movie depicts her as some lunatic, doddering back and forth between reality and some bad attempt on the part of the director at artistic merit.  The bottom line is that Margaret Thatcher was an important figure in history - regardless of which side of the political fence you happen to fall on - and it would have been nice to walk away with some semblance of who she was rather than some psychotic trip through the screenwriter's mind.",1392508800,,1594,4.627659574468085
4622343,4,B0059XTUXQ,"This movie is an exceptional portrait of Margaret Thatcher's life and times through the astonishing acting of Meryl Streep at her best.

I am British and lived through the Thatcher years (by the way hating her every move at the time). Thatcher clearly made history not only as the first and only woman Prime Minister but also because of her clear, tough decision making and towards the end, her rough way with her cabinet. She made some deeply unpopular decisions affecting the economy of Great Britain to this day in the most profound ways - such as retaining Britain's currency, breaking the miner's union and privatizing state assets. She fought a short, sharp war with Argentina over the Falklands, She raised the violence in Northern Ireland with increased police and military presence which brought bombings to the mainland and increased sectarian violence in N. Ireland which I lived through.

But whatever you think of The Iron Lady's politics in real life, Meryl Streep engages the viewer in a deeply personal and moving journey through Thatcher's life through the lens of the end of her life. Just fascinating. I never cried for Thatcher during her life but this movie, as much about end of life issues as politics and Thatcher, brought me to tears at points. Unexpectedly compelling.",1392336000,,1294,4.95852534562212
4622344,2,B0059XTUXQ,"How can a movie with Meryl Streep be such a dud? She gave a stunning preformance, but that's all the movie has going for it.

One would expect a movie about Margret Thatcher to be about Margret Thatcher's finest moments, not about her senior years and her advancing Alzheimer's. The film constantly jumps backwards and forward in time, with some scenes of Thatcher seeing and conversing with her dead husband, while other scenes he's alive and well depending on the year. If that isn't distracting and confusing enough, a different actress played the younger Thatcher, while Streep only played the middle-aged and elderly, dementia-riddled Thatcher. Who's bright idea was that? With proper make-up, as well as Streep's excellence, she could easily have played the younger Thatcher too.

I found the movie depressing, jumbled and very uninspiring. Streep is fantastic, but even her greatness didn't pull this one out of the mud.",1392249600,,927,5.132450331125828

4622347,3,B0059XTUXQ,"The highlight of this movie is Meryl Streep's portrayal of Maggie Thatcher. The downfall of this movie is the lack of authentic material she actually works with. It might as well be called ""a drama about a demented old lady as portrayed by Meryl Streep playing Margaret Thatcher."" Meryl Streep really has Margaret Thatcher down pat. The breathy voice and English accent are perfect, as far as I (a Yank) can tell. The hair, figure and clothing are also spot on as are the little mannerisms that Maggie Thatcher used. The biggest problem with the movie is the flashback device. The primary story is of Thatcher in retirement and so senile that she keeps forgetting her husband is dead. Everything else is little vignettes. Maggie liked a good fight and I think the portrayal of her fighting -- against male chauvinists, the Argentinians, and her own party on her way down -- are probably the highlights of the movie. The senility scenes dragged, and from what I've read in other places may well have been the least authentic parts of the story. So watch this movie primarily for Meryl Streep's amazing portrayal. Don't watch this movie for a good review of Thatcher's politics, which are still controversial in the UK -- and utterly unknown on this side of the Atlantic.",1391644800,7,1269,4.7727272727272725

4622381,2,B0059XTUXQ,I tried with my all energy to like this movie. I just could not! The movie starts out with Margaret Thatcher looking like an out of touch old lady with Dementia. I wished the movie would of had a more of appealing Biography Movie of the accomplishments and the life of Margaret Thatcher and not some old lady at the end of her golden years. Very disappointing movie. Meryl Streep did a great job as Margaret Thatcher but I wish she would have had the role as a more Younger and Vibrant Margaret Thatcher during her years as Prime Minister of England.,1390867200,,550,4.401960784313726
4622382,2,B0059XTUXQ,"This movie seemed to focus on Thatcher's latter years, when she had dementia.  They so wanted to make that a large part of the movie, they just made the movie based in modern times, with bits of flashbacks to Thatcher's earlier years, where she had to defend herself from a world collapsing around her (IRA, recession, etc).  It portrays Thatcher as a strong woman, yet someone who makes poor decisions and suffering from mental illness.

I was excited to see a movie about Thatcher because while I was not an English person,  and I was quite young at the time, I have read a lot of good things about her.

Despite Streep's remarkable performance, I had to stop halfway through because I thought it would be an insult to Thatcher to continue watching it.

Conservatives are the giant in ""Jack and the Beanstalk""  greedily  counting their gold, and wondering why everyone

I'm no fan of Thatcher's politics, but I think her accomplishments were important in the context of British conservatism, and that her life deserved a much better, much more balanced (even meaning ""more pointed political criticism of her"") story of her life than this screenplay offers.",1390089600,,660,5.055045871559633

A lot of folks commented that this movie was had on Lady Thatcher, but I didn't take it that way.  I've admired Thatcher for a long time, and don't see the portrayal of being abrasive as an insult.  She was a leader, and had much more spine than anyone around her.  Hell, Steve Jobs was abrasive too, but folks like this can't help it. They've got a vision and determination that most folks just don't comprehend, and yet they're able to change the world.

In my opinion, there's absolutely no doubt or argument that Meryl Streep delivers a hauntingly powerful performance. However, the movie is incredibly jumbled - constantly jumping back and forth between different parts of her early life, both before and after marriage, before and after entering politics. The result is not only a lack of chronological continuity - which may not be an issue for everyone - but that the overall message of the movie really seems to concentrate on her descent into dementia. For those who aren't familiar with the details and intricacies of her life, the punctuated events fall flat in the movie because her motivation, her character, and her interactions with others are unexplained. The movie finishes rather abruptly and leaves you feeling like half the story is missing - because it IS. Perhaps this would've been better as a mini-series to do justice to the intense issues and socio-economic upheavals she dealt with during her time in British politics. Either way, I feel this movie is rather a poor execution - and, but for Meryl Streep's exalting portrayal, it would have been completely ignored.",1389657600,,1235,5.149253731343284

4622447,3,B0059XTUXQ,"As a study of incipient dementia the movie works well, as an old Margaret Thatcher is seen in her final days.  Meryl Streep gives another outstanding performance, but if you are looking for any insight into Margaret Thatcher, politician or Margaret Thatcher female conservative [ politician], you will be wasting your time, since the rest of the movie reads as Margaret Thatcher's Greatest Hits.

Thatcher's formative years are quickly dispatched with a scene or two from the family grocery store and local politician dad giving some libertarian style speeches about one's own bootstraps. Thatcher's Oxford career [ she took a second in chemistry] is missing, and her courtship with her husband is whittled into a few flashbacks -we never learn that he was already a millionaire when they met and financed her law studies [ also missing].

Onward to the House of Commons we rush until Thatcher ascends to the position of Prime Minister. Her cabinet is most often filmed standing around her while the viewer gazes at them from her perspective, somewhat like the shots taken of the devil worshiping neighbors in Rosemary's Baby. A few news reels of the miners' strike later, a few explosions courtesy of the IRA and we are in the war room over the Falklands where Meryl Thatcher does her best impersonation of Churchill. The Cold War then is dispatched with a state function, and in the interim Thatcher dresses down her cabinet like a crazed school mistress.

There is no insight whatsoever into deep politics, no suggestion that the Falklands may have been strategically important because of their estimated offshore oil reserves, no insight into neo-liberalism or that Thatcher in all her can do earnestness might have been used by the Tories to take the economy from a manufacturing base to one in which deregulated finance rules, no mention that heavily taxed North Sea Oil revenue might have saved her administration rather than any policy she may have implemented and so on.

4622582,3,B0059XTUXQ,"THE IRON LADY boasts a wonderful central performance by Meryl Streep as Baroness Thatcher; she is wholly convincing at capturing the politician's peculiar vocal inflections.  The most interesting aspect of Phyllida Lloyd's film is the way it portrays Mrs. Thatcher as driven by hubris - despite her humble origins, she remained convinced of the rightness of her cause, even when she was manifestly wrong.  This was especially the case in 1990, when she was forced to resign as leader of the Conservative Party over her support for the Poll Tax.  The film shows how she rode roughshod over any objections raised by her Cabinet, even when they were probably right to object.  With this knowledge in mind, we do not feel much sympathy for her when she is shown as a lonely elderly lady, without the support of her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent), and trying and failing to fend for herself.  The supporting performances in this film are colorless, sometimes veering towards the grotesque (Richard E. Grant's Michael Heseltine is particularly guilty in this respect).  But the film belongs to Streep and her towering central characterization.",1385251200,,1136,5.080645161290323
4622583,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep turns in an unforgettable performance as Margaret Thatcher in ""Iron Lady"". As in so many other roles, Streep totally inhabits this character - from the accent to the hair, to the posture and speech patterns. She must have studied Thatcher tapes incessantly to absorb the mannerisms of this formidable and important historical character. And to do it while Ms. Thatcher was still alive must have added a tension and pressure to get it absolutely perfect.

In spite of this excellent casting decision, as well as Jim Broadbent as her husband, Denis, the screen play focuses more on the decay and old age of a once powerful woman rather than her impressive accomplishments. The story is told via flashbacks from the perspective of the elderly, widowed Thatcher who has developed dementia, and hallucinates that Denis is still with her. This narrative structure diminishes the historic significance of the career of a renowned political leader who steered Britain through some very challenging times. Though ""Iron Lady"" could have delivered so much more, I still enjoyed the history and flashback into the 1980's and the tough times that the Thatcher's endured.",1384646400,,1170,5.157894736842105

How can you call this movie as her 'biography'?

It is absolutely clear that this movie is made by someone who hates Ms Thatcher.  The camera takes a joy, an utter delight in showing her suffering as an old, decrepit, confused person.  THAT is what the movie wants to impress the viewers on!  Whenever there is a brief segment about her triumph as a politician or as a powerful woman,  the movie always, and IMMEDIATELY, goes back to  Thatcher as an ill and  lonely old pensioner!  Even the cover photo of  Thatcher looks very unflattering.  Why didn't the movie makers use the picture of her as old pensioner staggering along a lonely, cold street as the cover?  That would have been more representative of this movie!!!

In summary, new generation of young people may ask,  'Who is the 'Iron Lady'?  Why is she call that?'.  The movie quickly answers, 'Oh, she is nobody.  She is an old, decrepit, demented pensioner who sometimes has these wild flashbacks of delusion about her past'.

And you call this a biopic?  Just horrible.  Absolutely horrible.

The fact that Meryl Streep took the main role in this movie tells me that she IS the deluded fool about the cold war history.  I hope someone with less  personal hatred in his or her  heart can do some justice to the great life of Baroness Maggie Thatcher.",1383609600,8,1567,4.707407407407407
4622588,3,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her characterization of PM Thatcher.  I certainly feel as if I am watching the real Maggie herself from youth to death.  Some found the film's dwelling on her decline distateful; but I thought it a fine approach in summing the peaks and twists of her career into its final descent.  Alexandra Roach as young Margaret Roberts/Thatcher also gave a strong performance which has gone unappreciated - as to be expected - under all the Streep hype.

Aesthetics aside, the film is a meandering snapshot of a woman you either loved or hated.  The writers and producer are thus caught in this ambivalence: to respect the woman, and her commitment to her ideals, while apparently not caring for the specifics of said ideals.  However, in my view there really wasn't much appeal in the woman herself.  An envying, ambitious ""upstart"" who predictably aged into a bitter harridan as she settled into power, the real Maggie seemed haunted by her common past as she envied the ""successful""; bitterly resenting the fellow commoners who ""held her back"" from her (and therefore Britain's) ""greatness.""  Smashing the British trade unions so Brit Yuppies could squander millions in drunken partying was her lasting and quite unenviable legacy.

Laying waste to British democracy was, in the end, not enough to bring her downfall.  Only when she turned on her own Tory Politburo did the British Establishment finally, at long last, cry Enough.  The lesson of Thatcher's career is to beware the ambitious politicians who are compared - or compare themselves - to ferrous matter: A Man of Steel (Stalin) or an Iron Lady do not create structures of state and society without much waste and carnage in their wake.  The film makers are ambivalent about her legacy because she did, after all, ""stand for the West.""  It would be an ironic hoot to see a Russian film on the decline of Stalin, his mind wandering in his dacha to his own glory days of bank robbing, party purging, and war winning.",1383177600,,2025,4.868804664723032

Initially, Thatcher's husband, Dennis, was obviously an extremely confident man who certainly didn't feel threatened by his wife's brilliance and spunk. He appeared to revel in it.

Love these lines from the movie--Margaret Thatcher:  ""Ones life must matter.  Ones life must mean more than that.  People don't think anymore.  They only have feelings.  What we think we become.""

For all her errors, this woman was awesome.  The longest serving Priminister (president) in history.  She made history.  Just shows how history can be tainted by the phallic political agenda.  Thatcher's legacy should be studied in American history classes and universities.

Thatcher certainly held her own and stood firm in a career inflated by much testosterone driven ego--parliament.  She appeared to speak for the common woman and man, i.e., jobs, unions, IRA bombings, unemployment, economic health, industrialism, economics, assassination attempts.  Her country appeared to be at war with itself.

What an awesome speech, ""It's time to put the great back in Great Britain.""

I loved the scene when her assistant drapes her in a classic set of double strand 8-9 mm white pearls--what a lady.  I have always hated those Texas-size and country Barbara Bush pearls.  We may have won the war but it took us centuries to catch up with the Brits...a female president (priminister).

Love this line--Margaret Thatcher:  ""It used to be about doing something.  Now it's about being something.""  This reminds me of a proverb written by Solomon, ""Everything is vanity...""

This was a fascinating portrayal of Thatcher's life.

It vacillates between flashbacks of her life and a contemporary account of her decline into dementia.  But there is no obvious goal and, as a character, Thatcher fails to grow or change.  A good documentary would serve Thatcher's legacy better, certainly be more concise, and very likely more entertaining.",1372377600,,569,5.288888888888889
4622728,2,B0059XTUXQ,"This is a sub-standard film about a lady who appeared to have dementia and who loved/loves her late husband. Along the way it was interrupted by news archives of some of the most important events in the UK in the second half of the 20th century as the country's economic and social situation was changed almost beyond recognition. Perhaps the film-makers had a little too much funding because in some places reconstructions replaced the archive footage.

I finished watching this with mild feelings of anger towards those who made this film. Like her or loath her, Margaret Thatcher was one of the major forces in not only UK politics but the world scene as well. This was an attempt to portray `the woman' so it was long on pathos and the love story between her and Dennis yet almost completely lacking in analysis and chronicling of her achievements. The final scene where she washed up a teacup was particularly unnecessary.

Jim Broadbent was excellent, as he often is; Meryl Streep did a fine job; Olivia Colman did well as Carole Thatcher and Anthony Head was good as Geoffrey Howe.

I wasn't looking for a documentary but I did hope for some dramatisation and explanation of some of the seminal moments of the late 20th century. Where, for example, were any of the following, or perhaps I blinked and missed them:

* Standing up to the naysayers (even in her own party) as the economy worsened before it got better following her formulation then implementation of a monetarist economic policy.

* Any sort of scene with Ronald Reagan apart from a few seconds of dance.

* Any coverage of her dealings with Gorbachev - whom she had described as `a man we can do business with' whilst disagreeing fundamentally with his politics.

* Anything to do with her arguments with the European Union.

* The miners' strike - pretty much a civil war. What about the preparations made by the Government, the tactics, her feelings regarding the destruction of several communities.

* Northern Ireland and terrorism in general.

* The Falklands War got more than a few seconds of screen time but the scenes were so disjointed as to be barely worthwhile.

By simply showing clips of what had happened the film implies that she merely dealt well with events as they unfolded. Margaret Thatcher had strategies and principals and we should have seen more about how she made plans and put them into effect. I got no impression of her analysis of the country she started with nor her strategy to change it for the better (by her definition).

The opening scenes may have been fine to set the tone and use of flashbacks was perhaps a useful idea. However, the dementia scenes went on far too much and all we got in the end was some form of luvvie/arty self indulgence rather than a serious film charting her personality and life of achievement.",1371859200,,2829,4.704453441295547

The whole story is claustrophobically framed by long passages of Margaret Thatcher in later life, living in a private flat, imagining her deceased husband is still with her, fussing over the rising price of milk, etc. Much of it seems half-intentionally satirical, and it's hard to know how to take THE IRON LADY as a whole. There are some interesting flashbacks to Thatcher's early life and her political career; yet, it's never a good sign when the back-story outshines the front-story. This life story had so much potential and would have worked infinitely better as a linear biography from a more distant point of view.

Probably worth sitting through if you're interested in its general subject, but it will also probably prove quite unfulfilling in the end. Good performances by Streep and Broadbent, but they are not of that much value when the story itself is so languid.",1369353600,,892,4.94

1. Meryl Streep's acting is beyond fantastic (as usual) and the make-up is pretty amazing, too.
2. You get a brush-up on British history, by watching this film, which isn't a bad thing.

Other than that, it is poorly directed, extremely slow, very choppy, un-entertaining and I also started to fall asleep, which rarely happens when I watch a movie (I know this is standard for some people, so I wanted to clarify.) ;)

Honestly, there are so many movies to choose from: use 2 hours that you would waste on this one, and watch a different one. Or better yet, catch up on an extra 2 hours of sleep (most Americans are sleep deprived.)

4622799,2,B0059XTUXQ,"I'm sure I've seen worse movies, but not more disappointing ones. The fault, dear brutalized, is not in the stars, but in the sentimental, semi psychological  assault the writer and director perpetrate on the prime minister's story and on the viewing audience.  I'm rather sure that it is the opposite of the way Ms. Thatcher would have liked her life to be portrayed.

A glance at the interview with screenwriter Abi Morgan ([...] that this project went wrong at the start.  She states a comment from Ms. Thatcher's daughter about her mother's dementia was the most intriguing thing to her about her  subject's life and the script goes on to highlight Ms. Morgan's speculations on the subject. . Surely there are more important things to focus on in a biopic about the first woman Prime Minister of England who led the country for eleven significant years. Many may have disagreed with her, but a movie which glosses over Ms. Thatcher's devotion to principles and ideas is an insult to an accomplished woman's life. If the film LINCOLN took this approach, it would have been panned unceasingly.

If you want to see a movie about dementia, get The Notebook and avoid this dog.  If you want to know something about Margaret Thatcher, avoid this dog also.

I'm neither a fan nor a hater of Thatcher. Matter-of-fact, I don't really know much about her at all even as I knew of her and recall some of the events out of the UK in the 70s and 80s. I wanted to watch, especially in the aftermath of her recent passing, to get some perspective, even if it was Hollywood-ized. This movie was a travesty. Unless the point of the movie was to show the ravages of Alzheimer's or dementia - and it wasn't - there's little excuse for such a cold blooded production, regardless of how you feel about her and her political record. For God's sake, I've seen Hitler given more compassionate treatment.

I kept waiting for it to settle into a continual story of her rise and career, but just when it got going; we were back to her home and her stumbling incoherence.

The movie, set in her final doddering years, shows her rise in politics and her relationship with her husband, Dennis, through flashbacks.  This enables the film to show but gloss over the phenomenal accomplishments of her leadership and, instead, show her as a frail old lady who sees and talks to her dead husband.  That's likely the best a great Conservative leader can receive from today's Hollywood.  The elements are there but her successes pass by almost too quickly to see.

She in fact won the Oscar with the votes of Academy members who must hate Margaret Thactcher as much as she does. I'd rather see Streep portray a madwoman honestly. Thatcher's was a life of firsts, a remarkable woman's success story. Given that, this film is beyond misogynist. It does not matter what anyone thinks of Thatcher's career. This treatment of her life is deeply disrespectful. I wonder if the dotage of a male leader would ever serve as the center of a biographical narrative of his life.

Like 'The Queen,' 'The Iron Lady' gives a sympathetic view of Margaret Thatcher. The scenes showing her family persevering through the bombing of Britain as well as her father's work ethic helped shape her political philosophy as well as her will.

It should be noted it was the Russians that dubbed her, 'The Iron Lady.' One can only imagine what must have gone through their heads when she sent the British Navy almost 8,000 miles to take back an island of 1,800 civilians. It was a clear message to the soviets as to what would happen should the cold war ever heat up on her shores.

One must ask the question; if the British Embassy in Benghazi had been attacked on Thatcher's watch, what would she have done?

While I was excited about learning more about a woman who I knew little about initially, I was a bit disappointed that they chose to diminish her story by including the dementia as a major plot device (and I really hate the use of flashbacks to move a story along); I would have preferred a straight bio-pic of her accomplishments and impact on the political process.

I came into the movie not knowing all that much about Margaret Thatcher.

The movie is highly disrespectful towards Margaret Thatcher.

The reason is because about 1/3 of the movie is spent depicting Ms. Thatcher as a senile old woman losing her bearings.

Highly disrespectful. Everyone gets old. Everyone gets senile. Why make the story of Margaret Thatcher about her as a woman talking to ghosts?

The same could be done to just about any liberal/leftist hero (the few that live to old age, that is).

The rest of the film is fine. It is artfully done in a David Fincher style. You see glimmerings of her career though it's just skin deep. You don't really see any deep discussion on her policies. You are treated to soundbites about individualism and free markets.

That part is fine. There is a disconnect between political rhetoric and the real world. Party politics is pretty much about convincing the people in the room that you mean business, more than it is about effects on the society.

I thoroughly enjoyed this drama. However, to be honest, my friends and family were not as enthusiastic as I.
I would still recommend it because there are so many little things that I was not aware of, as well as many things that I did not
know because I am not English or British.

It's human part of  history that would otherwise have been completely hidden from the world.

She deserved the Oscar she won for the performance; but I still believe Viola Davis deserved it more; mainly because of the impact and the quality of the two films...""The Help"" is an outstanding film...this one sadly is not. Margaret Thatcher was truly a great British statesman; the first and only female Prime Minister and the longest reigning. She took Great Britain from the depths of socialism and near bankruptcy to once more being an economic power. She took the country from mediocrity as a world power to a power to be reckoned with...along with Ronald Reagan, she brokered a bloodless end to the Cold War. Bottom line, she is probably the greatest woman of the 20th Century. This biopic does not portray that greatness, spending entirely too much time and too many scenes depicting the long retired, sickly, old lady w/dementia. Perhaps the producers and writers were reluctant to show a conservative statesman in a good light; but for whatever reason, the real Margaret Thatcher does not receive the treatment she deserves in this film. The four stars are for Streep's performance and to a lesser degree Jim Broadbent, who plays Thatcher's husband, Denis...seen only as a hallucination by the demented Thatcher.

4623060,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep was exquisite as an actress as usual, and the cinematography was quite enthralling. Sadly, that is all I can say positively about this movie.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a woman who fought through male chauvinism to become Britain's first woman Prime Minister and its longest serving one at that. She lived through World War II, survived an IRA bombing, kept Western Europe together during the Cold War, and grew UK's GDP by 23 percent (annualized) for ten years.

So, against this backdrop, the movie spent well over 75% of its time focusing on Lady Thatcher's mental decline??? Her achievements, her mastery (though sometimes clumsy) of British politics, her razor sharp wit and intellect were nothing more than thin bookends of her dementia in the movie.

Folks! When people get old, they develop ailments; some worse than others, but that is natural and normal... nothing to really write home about - what is worth raving about is her character: her strength, vision, values, tenacity, wit, intellect and quiet sense of pride. Yes, she is a flawed person who was a flawed Prime Minister but no more than any other.

So, I find this movie, well-made as it is, repulsive and deeply-insulting for de-emphasizing her achievements and over-emphasizing her mental decline. If not insulting to Lady Thatcher, it is to those of us who were alive during the 1980's and saw a world in turmoil (like we are once again now), and the Iron Lady was instrumental in the survival of Great Britain and most of Europe. We would be lucky to have another Margaret Thatcher as leader of the UK or here in the US.",1358121600,6,1611,4.805054151624549
4623061,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Right out of the gate, I want to know:  what was the motivation for the making of this film?  Was it so that Meryl Streep could be up for another Oscar, or perhaps so that the Hollywood left could take a swipe -- OK, way more than one -- at somebody on the right?

I have to admit, I'm not completely knowledgeable about the life of Margaret Thatcher, not even after watching this jumbled sorry mess of a film.  The narrative is told through a series of flashbacks, where those flashbacks involve the aged Ms. Thatcher reminiscing about her life, at least as well as she's able.  Evidently, she has Alzheimers -- I'm not sure of this and I won't even research it -- because that's at least how they portray her here.  But I have to ask the following:  if Ms. Thatcher was a liberal, wouldn't the filmmakers have been much more kind to her legacy?  Was it OK to treat her so poorly because she was a conservative?  And most importantly, what does her family think of this film?  (My guess:  they detest it.)

But the bigger issue:  why didn't they just stick with a standard linear narrative here, perhaps modified by starting at the end of her life -- briefly -- then going back to the beginning when she was a child and working their way forward?  It would then surely have been easier to follow, as I became confused myself at points who was even real and who was imagined.  I feel that, in order to watch this film at all, one nearly needs to be a near-expert on the former prime minister's life.

I am a big Meryl Streep fan, but she had no chance of saving this disaster.  And I'm actually a little perturbed that she even tried. In my opinion, she should have politely declined this slamfest and done another project.  A big pass on this one from me.",1358035200,2,1756,4.3343558282208585

Sadly, however, we also see Margaret in decline, the ever-supportive Dennis having pre-deceased her, the years of focus on politics resulting in a frosty relationship with her children, dementia slowly claiming her. Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret was not quite believable. . . .I wish we had seen a bit more of the strength of will that must have always been there. But Streep as always is a pleasure to watch.",1355875200,,897,5.108843537414966

4623168,1,B0059XTUXQ,"I was drawn to the movie by Streep, but was quickly disappointed by the dementia theme and hallucinations throughout the film.  Maggie's greatest offense is she was a 'conservative' and Hollywood never forgives.  I watched a 2012 DVD documentary (from the local Library) on Thatcher after enduring this painful hit peace, just to confirm what I remember of Thatcher.  Thatcher, Reagan, and Pope John Paul 2, were a formidable team.  This hit piece never really explored that relationship and only showed Reagan in one scene.

I suspect when it is time, Hilary Clinton will be portrayed as a great world leader and nobody will dwell on Whitewater, Vince Foster, or Monica.  I'm sure she will be viewed favorably on the Libya fiasco and who cares if an Ambassador is killed. That is just the way it is.  Hollywood has an agenda.

In my view, Thatcher ranks up there with Churchill.  She was truly a historical figure and deserved an unbiased portrayal.  Instead she is treated as a mental case subject to weird visions, somewhat similar to the technique used in the 'Last Temptation of Christ' with Dustin Hoffman as the Devil.  Of course, Jesus was not shown in a good light in that movie.

I breathed a sigh of relief when the film finally transitioned to a younger portion of her life. But the respite was frustratingly brief.

4623237,5,B0059XTUXQ,"The Iron Lady starring Meryl Streep was written by Abi Morgan and directed by Phyllida Lloyd. Before giving a critique I need to give accolades to Meryl Streep's performance. She has to be one of the greatest character actresses of our day.

The movie takes place in present day after Margaret Thatcher has served as prime minister. She is elderly and is struggling to grasp reality. She talks with her dead husband and has moments where she still thinks that she is the Prime Minister. The film is riddled with flashbacks-most occurring whilst she is having hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband. These flashbacks give us glimpses of the Ladies childhood, her marriage, motherhood, and political career. Some of the flashbacks are of very happy times, e.g. her husband proposing and their dancing together after Margaret's first election bid loss. Other flashbacks lead us to conclude that Margaret was driven by her career more than she was driven to be a present mother or wife. She calls herself a public servant and as such can not ignore the need she sees for a good leader. When her then boyfriend proposes she says with tears in her eyes, `Beyond all the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must matter. I can not die washing up a tea cup.'

There are a few key elemental thoughts in the movie. One among them is the very obvious fact that Margaret Thatcher forged ahead in a world dominated by men. In the movies' present she makes the comment that she has always preferred the company of men. During the movie, however, most of the other politicians are made to seem sinister through clever camera work. No doubt it was difficult for Margaret to forge her way, but her campaign leaders played on her differences to get her elected. She was dubbed, by a Russian reporter, the Iron Lady. She seemed to have no problem making herself heard among men.

Another big theme is the idea that you must do something if you are able-make yourself useful. There is an scene where she in sharing her views on economics and politics with a room full of men and says that what people really need to do is to do something about the situation they find themselves in and stop complaining about it. She makes a reference to `good housekeeping' when faced with the reality that money may need to be stretched from week to week for the working man...or woman. A present day scene in the movie shows a younger woman thanking Margaret for the influence that she has had on her and for showing women that they can be something. Margaret replies to this only by exclaiming that everyone now seems to care more about being something than doing something. This is an interesting take on the existential understanding of our place in the `grand scheme'. Again, when at the doctor and asked how she feels (in conjunction with the grief of her husbands death), Margaret replies with:

What am I bound to be feeling? People don't think anymore. They feel. Oh, how are you feeling? Well I don't feel comfortable. Oh, I'm so sorry...we the group were feeling...(clears throat)...Do you know, one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people that care more about feelings than they do about thoughts and ideas. Now, thoughts and ideas-that interests me!

This is fascinating because it shows that the former Prime Minister was defined by something that could be weighed more substantially. Margaret was pragmatic and concerned with fact. She was not easily swayed by the feelings of others. This plays out truly in the film as we see the results of her strict economic legislation as well as her relationship with her children.

As the film draws to a close you get the sense that Margaret is searching for peace at the end of her life. It is here that I must hand it to Mr. Godawa who said that most of the stories in movies are about redemption. Margaret is searching for redemption and peace. She is haunted by her husband. She replays memories of riots, her daughters unhappiness with her mother, and the film makes her son's absence very poignant. The climax of the story is an elderly Margaret Thatcher packing up all her husbands things and finally saying goodbye. She makes a hard choice but she wants to be at peace. The very last scene is Margaret washing up her tea cup. She has fought and accomplished something great with her life and she has accepted whatever the costs were. Now, she is not afraid to die while washing up.",1354924800,,4466,4.668360864040661

Thatcher became powerful when politics was still really an old boys club and policies helped to steer England on a successful course.

  If a more depressing film got made that year, I don't know which it was.  But ""The Iron Lady?""  What were they thinking when they made this?
  Spoiler Alert!!!  The first quarter or so of the film is mainly Mrs. Thatcher shown in serious decline -- just hours away, it seemed, from complete absorption in senile dementia.  And the only relief provided from that -- for the audience, that is --was by brief flashbacks of what she was sketchily able to remember about her past.
  Now, like her or not, one has to admit that Mrs Thatcher lived an interesting life.  Certainly one that was worth a biography or two.  Given that, though, why one that focuses so on a tragic closing episode?

Streep is so far beyond the powers of mere mortals now, it's almost a given that she would deliver on what could have been a caricature (especially in England, where mock Thatchers are part of popular comedy). Though at times she reminded me of the character she played in The Devil Wears Prada, this performance was astonishing, as so many have already said.

Streep is surrounded by superb actors in a storyline that avoids clich&eacute; by using ""dead"" characters for the Thatcher character to chat with, eliminating countless flashbacks and exposition. This is not new, but it's done very well here and never loses the thread.

While I believe that was the point the creators were trying to make I think unfortunately what they ended up showing was a over barring over reaching person, who now at the end of their life was left with nothing, but regrets and sadness.

Whether the viewer agrees with Margret Thatcher's policies or not, the creator, if they wanted to make her a sympathetic character needed to believe in her polices and unfortunately what the movie portrayed was that they did not, and what you are end up with is a protagonist that you can feel sorry for because as the creators feel at the end of her life she is a failed sad person, but not one you can sympathize with because I don't think anyone dreams of ending up a failed sad person.

4623535,4,B0059XTUXQ,"I'd heard concerns that this movie wasn't as good as it could have been because too much time was spent showing Thatcher's mental instability at the end. But I think the way it was done, it worked, and I don't think too much was made of it. It was a unique way to tell the story of her life both internally, in terms of her deep love for her husband, and externally, where she didn't show her feelings.  I don't know if the ""iron"" lady is an appropriate analogy for Thatcher. Iron tends to mean strength to me, and I don't see strength in someone who is rigid, unyielding, and convinced she is right about everything.  Thatcher considered those who disagreed with her politics ""too cowardly"" to do what she believed must be done, and that is just massive invalidation of the opinions and expertise of others.  The movie is timely in that it shows the results of following the kind of political philosophy Thatcher shared with her friend Ronald Reagan and that is being advocated, though in more extreme form, by Romney and the Tea Party GOP these days. It shows what happens when you impose such politics on a country - the people rebel and Thatcher became the most hated prime minister of all time.  She would have been thrown out of office had she not had the sense to resign, although she was never able to be open to the positions of others. As offensive and poor-equipped to lead as she turned out to be, the sequences that show her hallucinating her husband's presence serve to bring out the vulnerable humanity in her, and far from being too much of an excursion into her mental instability, are what makes this a really great movie to watch.  The only thing that was missing, and a very big omission in my opinion, was to see what the response of the Royal Family was to Thatcher and her politics and to have some response from them.

No worries with this one, Maggie.  This film was made without thought or character and is destined to become one of the lousiest biops in history.

I was anticipating a powerful film about a powerful woman and ended up with looney Aunt Tilley over tea and toast.  The filmmakers took special delight in melting The Iron Lady into a pile of mush.  It's hard to come to any conclusion about Margaret the woman and politician when she's staring into space talking to a wall.  Politicians are often quite nutty, but did they have to turn this into another ""A Beautiful Mind?""

I thought the cast did a great job of portraying people over time, and the script conveyed the arc of human accomplishment and then deterioration. I don't know too much about Britain's political system, but this gave me just enough to get an understanding of it. Margaret Thatcher's prominent rise through the political ranks to the top job was well documented (or documented enough for me). Her achievement as a woman in the middle of the old boy network is certainly something that hasn't been done in the U.S. - yet - and that in itself is remarkable.

Pros:

Cons:
Movie only focuses on some of the highlights of her life. Most is not covered
To understand and appreciate the movie, one must have prior knowledge of her presidential events. The movie does not explain the events and does not put them into perspective.
The movie leaves you wanting to know more about events and characters discussed.

This is not a documentary and the movie does not attempt to provide a biography of her life. It would be impossible to discuss her life's events in a couple hour entertaining movie. The movie does not take a position on whether her legacy was good or bad. It simply puts the events out there. I don't agree with many reviews that deride this movie for some of these reasons.

The point of view (recollections of an aged Thatcher) is genius; it makes the film pop. Thatchers aging is done with taste; nothing tacky.
There are good history lessons: reminders of what has gone on. Seen from the British point of view. Make no mistake, this is a character study, not a history lesson - but you can't avoid seeing history when studying a former Prime Minister.

The download from Amazon to TiVo was flawless. I ordered from the TiVo Search function, TiVo contacted Amazon ... later the movie was waiting for me on the TiVo.

It is a non-linear reflection of choices made by this amazing woman against the backdrop of her senile senior years, in which she comes to realize what she gave up to pursue her chosen path.  In short, she neglects her family to serve the free world.  Only, the movie doesn't really develop the high points of her career - for example, the Falklands get some attention, but the Cold War is all but absent.  I enjoyed the real-life footage that seems to have become standard fare for biopics these days, but I was disappointed at the lack of historical context for her achievements.

A woman buys a pint of milk at a grocery. [The story proceeds slowly. What was its purpose?] There is a flashback to the bombing of WW II. Margaret helps her father at his store (like a good daughter should). The TV tells about an explosion at a Brighton hotel. Next Miss Roberts is chosen as a Conservative candidate for Parliament. She explains her viewpoints. [The film keeps skipping from the present to the past. This is confusing to anyone who knows little of her history.] Margaret will marry Dennis but wants to be more than a housewife. In retirement she watches old home movies of her children. ""They grow up so fast."" She wins a seat in Parliament in 1959 (because of a divided opposition). ""Welcome to the madhouse."" She makes a speech. A strike stops garbage collection and other services. There was a coal miner's strike over lowered wages circa 1972.

Margaret decides to run for leader of the party on principle. A man advises her on her appearance to attract voters. She takes voice lessons to project her image. A friend is killed by a bomb! In 1979 she became the first woman Prime Minister in the Western World. [The film jumps ahead again.] Baroness Thatcher was called ""The Iron Lady"". She cut the budget and privatized services. [So how did that work out for the British?] Did she ""change the face of history""? Did her policies cause a drop in industrial production? Were people becoming impoverished? There was growing unemployment. Bombs are set off! The Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands. Maggie said sink the Belgrano (as it was returning home). An Exocet missile hits British frigate. The British retake the Falkland Islands. This victory proves popular and boosts her standing. She asks for new taxes on everyone and accuses those who disagree with her of cowardice. [Has she grown proud and arrogant?] There are disturbances in the streets.

The jumping back and forth in the first half of this movie makes it difficult to follow if you know little of the details of her life. It should have followed the historical sequence. You see actors who represent actual politicians; they are unknown to those who know the details of British politics. Thatcher destroyed the national coal industry to make the country dependent on imported oil and gas (as far as I know). This benefitted these special interests. The future will decide if this was a correct decision.

There was a military coup in Argentina in the mid-1960s (part of the ""Alliance for Progress""). It led to the oppression of the people. The attempt to reclaim the Falkland Islands with an invasion. This failure led to their overthrow and a more democratic government. The same thing happened in Greece a decade earlier. Is there a lesson here?
I wonder about the powers that first backed Maggie Thatcher then switched to a new leader (she was rejected by her own party). There was not mention of this in the movie. Was Great Britain in better shape after her reign as Prime Minister? What corporations promoted her?",1347062400,2,3038,4.803059273422562

Unfortunately the film can be used to illustrate what we mean by a ""Hollywood"" version of a famous and influential person's life.

Instead, whoever made ""The Iron Lady"" has done the impossible. They succeeded in making Margaret Thatcher's life story boring.

It's a schizophrenic film about an elderly woman suffering from dementia with brief little bits and pieces of her formative years and political career thrown in at random.  I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this. Maybe they wanted to spread the gloomy message that accomplishing great things doesn't matter because you'll end up old, helpless, and forgotten anyway?  Maybe they wanted to recreate for their audience the confused thoughts of people with dementia? Or maybe they hired Edward Scissorhands to do the film editing because he needed a job? Anyway, all the jumping back and forth was confusing, then I got bored enough not to care.

If your objective is to get some idea of what Margaret Thatcher was all about, you'd be better off (and more entertained) watching videos of her speeches on YouTube or reading a biography.  But if you have insomnia and your objective is to find an alternative to sleeping pills or counting sheep, then you should buy this movie.

The one star I gave was for Meryl Streep's performance.  She was very convincing as Margaret Thatcher--looked like her, sounded like her.  Streep's talent was wasted on this movie.

4623769,3,B0059XTUXQ,"When the Soviets coined the title ""the iron lady"" for Margaret Thatcher, it was a slur that the British embraced as a compliment. This film takes the opposite tack toward the oxymoron. Rather than the lady's unexpectedly turning out to be made of metal, MT turns out to be made not of iron at all but of mortal and poignantly weak flesh (as are we all)--ultimately dependent on her daughter Carol, without close friends, even without the support and attention of her son (the father of her only grandchildren), who cannot be bothered to visit her. The film is structured as a series of flashbacks experienced by Margaret in old age after her husband Dennis's death. The victories of her past are entirely overbalanced by the compromises she suffers in the film's present. All her triumphs are qualified by the viewer's knowledge that, in her later years, she has become the victim of hallucinations that Dennis is still alive, that she fears for her sanity, and that she cannot be allowed out of her flat to buy a pint of milk (the first scene).

One can see how it might have appealed to the makers of this film to exploit the gap between Thatcher's almost super-human strength and her all-too-human weakness. And yet this irony is more than a local effect in the movie, but the repeated and central conceit. Further, the title links the contradiction to her sex, and so it's hard for me not to feel that the film thus exploits the fact of her being a woman. Consider that her dependency is presented as having required her only daughter Carol to serve as her caretaker; the world of the present in which Margaret lives is sterile and constrained. Strong men are not thus portrayed in biopics about their lives, and the title ""The Iron Man"" would surely suggest a different implication.

While Meryl Streep is brilliant in the role, one cannot help but be disappointed that she did not use her considerable stature as an actress to press for a more balanced view of Thatcher's accomplishments. Thatcher was one of the most influential and admired women of the twentieth century. To see her legacy so diminished--to remember her chiefly as a tormented and prattling dowager should be dispiriting to all women, regardless of the viewer's political persuasion.",1344902400,,2258,4.787179487179487
4623770,5,B0059XTUXQ,"I agree with the general criticism that there is too much of the old and senile Thatcher and not enough of the career.  Nevertheless, one does get a better glimpse into her true character watching her not in full control of her public appearances.  There is merit to that.

The film, on the whole, is otherwise balanced and gives a positive (in my view correct) view on the woman's character, which did much good (with some harm of course) to her country.  One needs only watch the scene showing her conduct during the Falklands to see my point.  Sinking the Belgrano was not an easy decision, and it was a politically difficult one for her.  She did it, and winning the war makes everybody forget all about it. 30 years before London 2012 Thatcher put the ""Great"" back into Great Britain.

The special features are a paltry bonus - we can use more of Streep's painstaking preparation to find out how she plays the character so realistically.

Did Streep play Thatcher or was it Thatcher playing Streep in this movie?  I can hardly tell, and I grew up watching her on television.  Streep is a stunning mimic.

On screen for the whole film with the exception of the younger actress playing Thachter, Streep once again proves, her talent as an actress is really unsurpassed by any of the other respected ladies of today.  In fact she's damn historical.  She becomes the character in her films and here she leaves no room for the competition.  I really do not recall any other actress playing an elderly woman with such grace and technique seemlessly connecting the middle aged woman to the hardly frail elderly woman Thachter became.

4623774,3,B0059XTUXQ,"I purchased this movie hoping to get a strong picture of an important lady. I got a fairly good movie, an excellent leading actress, but I felt a sense of being ""let-down"". I do not feel that I got what I expected.  The movie seems to center around an elderly lady with dimentia who is remembering her life in flashbacks. I think there is too much of the film devoted to her old age. I would have liked to see more on the other aspects of her life. Particularly her interactions with Ronald Regan.

Still, there are parts of the filim that are excellent. The make-up people did a wonderful job of making Meryl Streep look like Margaret Thatcher. I liked the portrayal of her marriage and the happiness she appeared to have with her husband. I liked the daughter who had the sole caregiver of her mother (her brother was away). It reminded me a lot of my own problems dealing with an aging mother who is imagining things.

Thatcher was a pioneer in that she was the first woman to become prime minister of Britian, a great accomplishment for a woman in our day and age. She proved that a woman can hold a high government office and do the job well. I admire her for that, though I don't totally agree with her politics.

4623826,2,B0059XTUXQ,"I was eager to watch this movie.  It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of her politics or not.  This movie insults Margaret Thatcher.

The majority of the movie is in the present and portrays Thatcher as a demented lonely forgotten old woman.  Her husband is dead and her son lives in Africa and doesn't speak to her.  The reason for her son's withdrawal?  She abandoned her family to pursue her political ambitions and satisfy her hunger for power.  Now there is no question that the families of politicians sacrifice much to support them.  But when have you ever seen a male politician shamed and belittled for the sacrifice of their families?  In one scene, Thatcher is driving off for her first day in Parliament.  As she drives off her children are chasing her down the driveway ""don't leave us mommy!"".  This aspect of the film is mostly troubling and completely misogynistic as it paints the picture that women who serve are selfish and power hungry while men are self sacrificing.

It also paints Thatcher as stubborn, rude, and unwilling to listen to all sides.  She should be portrayed as someone who's dedication to her core principles remained unshaken throughout her life.  Because of this, she should be honored as one of the greatest leaders this world has known.",1344124800,13,1280,4.7853881278538815
4623827,5,B0059XTUXQ,"If you want to change a party lead it, if you want to change a country lead it!,

What a performance from Meryl Streep! One of her best movies if not THE BEST! She is quite unbelievable. Forget Deer Hunter, and the Devil wears Prada. She is probably the only actrice alive today that can put together such a performance.

I understand that some people didn't like the back and forth between now as a sick individual and the past as a powerful LEADER. I also understand that some people thought that this movie is an insult to a great leader. However, while at the beginning I was frustrated too, by the end of the movie you get the message. This movie unlike many people try to make you think is homage to Margaret Thatcher's life, character and will. She is winning against the disease too.

Never compromise. This is absolutely true for Maggie. She is fighting a terrible incurable disease now the same way she fought the other diseases that were taking over her country at the time she was Prime Minister. She is not confused at all as many people try to make you believe. The very end of the movie shows you what Maggie is all about. She is packing all of her husband's stuff, and she tells him: if I don't hear you don't exist; you are dead.

The movie shows briefly her confrontations with the unions as a secretary of Education. The things that she said then can be applied to today's society easily.

This movie is very actual, and there are so many similarities with the current political situation in the world that it will be very difficult for me to summarize them. You must watch the movie! And learn. Try to find leaders and try to convince them to run for office and let them try to change the world for the better. Do not let the politicians run for office. Find the leaders!

When Maggie first decided to run, she was convinced she is not going to win, but she wanted to make a point. Airey Neave then told her the famous quote that is in the title of my review. When there were riots in the streets, the politicians came and told her to slow down. When Maggie asked them why, they replied because we are going to lose the next elections. And Maggie goes: ""aha, we worry about job security!"" Look around you. How many politicians you know that will really run for their ideas regardless of their popularity. That is a leader. There were only three leaders in the second half of the last century: Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. This movie depicts the life of one of them who like Churchill after saving Great Britain from misery, was immediately dismissed by the people who like and prefer instant gratification. (Churchill was good enough to lead Britain to victory during World War II, but was not good enough to lead Great Britain in time of peace according to the British voters at that time. Go figure!)

There is a great scene in the movie when Maggie as a patient goes to the doctor and the doctor says: How do you feel Maggie? And then she starts with a great monologue about society that worries more about feelings than people's thoughts. Could that be applied to today's society? Absolutely!

Great movie, five stars all around because of the acting, the script, and the director. It shows what a person with real character is. Keep the movie handy and watch it many times. Each time you will find a point of interest that you missed in the previous viewing. Need to find somebody like her and Reagan these days to help deal with the very difficult times.",1343865600,,3507,4.4858934169279

Why? Because the script and the vehicle used to tell Thatcher's story was so dreadful.

It's an old and hackneyed vehicle.  Thatcher's ""story"" is told via flashbacks, which in and of itself isn't a problem, but The Iron Lady devotes what seems like 50% of the screen time to a current-day view of a frail, pitiful old woman suffering from dementia and haunted by the ghost of her late husband.  The makeup is great, and the performance is terrific, but this is a biopic, and the massive amounts of screen time devoted to this pitiful old woman adds absolutely nothing to our understanding of Margaret Thatcher the politician or Margaret Thatcher the prime minister.

OK, she adored her father. Got it. She stood up to men in the UK at a time when that wasn't done. Got it. People underestimated her.  Got it.  I would like to have learned more, but we kept returning to the demented old woman haunted by her husband's ghost.  Yawn. Was this supposed to be the portrait of a woman's downfall?  Are we supposed to feel pity for her?  I really never got the point, and frankly I was bored.",1343865600,,1277,4.56140350877193

I decided to do some research and realized that she has indeed aged alot in the last 20 years and according to her daughters book is having some memory problems.

Carol Thatcher, her daughter never implied that her mother hallucinated or talked to her dead husband.  My belief is that whoever wrote this did not like Margaret Thatcher.  This movie as in the movie 'The Queen' typed up conversations that went on in the intimacy of her own home where no one could have listened to.  The movie was full of ridiculous implications about what Margaret Thatcher said or did in the privacy of her own home with her family as in the movie 'The Queen' (which I believe was done to gain sympathy for the Royal family).

After a very slooooooow, tedious start and about 15 minutes into it, I eventually figured out that the storyline was going to be a series of flashbacks as almost random filler to an invented story devoting most of its duration to showing Margaret Thatcher as a senile old woman, engaging in numerous conversations with her deceased husband. Those flashbacks occurred so randomly, I was not even clear as to whether those conversations were with the living or with the deceased Mr. Thatcher.  The timeline seemed haphazard and, even for someone like me who was living and aware during the Thatcher years, it was certainly confusing. This movie should never be used as remotely presenting historical fact.

A movie about a public figure should be about that persons public life and importance to their country and the world, possibly extended with private struggles that took place during the period of service if there is some justifiable significance. However, that person's private retirement is irrelevant. Further, a movie about the tragedy of dementia should have some sort of social significance and learning value. This one fails on both counts.

The film is not totally without its merits. Yes, in her lucid scenes Lady Thatcher is shown as a woman of principle, determination, courage and will of iron as the title suggests. But those are limited and serve just as interrupters to all the crazy scenes. Yes, Merrill Streep's acting is superb. She captures the Lady's character and presence amazingly well. Those strengths, however, cannot sufficiently offset a bizarre plot, a dismal made-up script, excessive flip-flopping, incorporation of stale file footage from the 80's and overall dull movie.

4623918,2,B0059XTUXQ,"The idea of a film portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is an interesting one.  I just really wish that this film were more interesting.  Instead of giving us anything of substantial depth, director Phyllida Lloyd serves up a series of scenes that serve no purpose other than to prove that Meryl Streep can do anything.  Sadly, her performance is hindered so drastically by the horrific pacing and emotional emptiness that I feel her Oscar win will be largely considered one of the most undeserved in recent years.

I'm not going to sit here and bash the film.  It isn't...terrible.  Some critics were relentless and some of my friends said it was the worst film of 2011.  It wasn't.  At least this film isn't insulting.  I would watch this again before watching something like `The Descendants'.  That being said, this film is far from good.  It is actually pretty bad, especially for what it attempts to do.  Lloyd is a very inept director (as was proven by her botched job with `Mamma Mia') and trying to tackle something of considerable depth left her coming up VERY short.  She manages to take a woman who had so many stories to tell and reducing her to a montage a scenes with zero complexity.  The shoddy editing takes us in and out of Thatcher's life, at times in nonsensical order, as a way of weaving her past into her present, but this only serves as a way to take us out of the story and place us elsewhere.  If it weren't for Streep's obvious handle of the material I would have turned the film off a quarter of the way through.  It lags too often, and the unintentional camp that comes in with the constant regurgitation of events (the handling of Thatcher's hallucinations is clichd and overused) made my eyes hurt from all the rolling they were doing.

It feels weird to say that Lloyd should have called up Ron Howard for tips on how to build a coherent and engaging portrayal of mental illness, but she should have.

The lack of emotional connect makes this a really shallow portrait of an important woman.  By film's end, we really don't learn anything about her.  Lloyd is so bent on portraying Thatcher's inability to let go of her late husband that she fails to build anything else, and she forgets to really color in WHY Thatcher can't let go.  The scenes with Streep and Broadbent don't paint Denis Thatcher as anything special or really allow them to build a relationship.  In fact, Thatcher is basically painted as a solitary entity the entire length of the film with no real emotional ties to anyone.  Her ambition drives her, but that is never truly explored, and I wouldn't have even took to that concept had Broadbent not shouted it at the camera in one particular scene.  Lloyd doesn't layer anything here.  She tries to pass off segues as complete thoughts (let's zoom in on a photograph and then show scene that has no tie to the last and then zoom out at an old woman staring blankly at a wall and call that depth) and it just doesn't work.

Streep is a wonderful actress.  She can really do no wrong.  Her talent is non-negotiable and yet even she falls victim to Lloyd's horrendous grasp of the material.  By splicing the film in such a nonsensical manner, Lloyd has stripped Streep's performance of depth and meaning and merely presented us with a really good mimicry act, but nothing more.

I am upset with the voters for making me think the movie was worth watching. It was disjointed, slow and hard to follow. It was a waste of an opportunity to show why she was the Iron Lady, all I saw was a sad confused alone woman, who talked to her dead husband, whom we had a hard time following was not there. Do not waste your time or money watching this bomb. Shame on the academy for giving this movie any Oscars, I wil not believe them any longer.

In this case, I agree with many reviews that far too much of the movie focuses on the elderly, dementia afflicted Thatcher and not nearly enough on her achievements in rising to be the first female Prime Minister of Great Britain. Whether this was politically motivated or simply an artistic choice to focus on the more intimate, poignant end of life for a power figure, I don't know, but the movie suffered for it. It's unavoidable to compare and contrast this with other recent bio-pics of 20th century British figures such as The King's Speech and The Queen, which both come off FAR more cohesively than this fragmented film does.

4623970,3,B0059XTUXQ,"Released December 30, 2011. Widescreen. Running Time: 1 hour, 44 mins.
  The movie begins with Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep), in her life of retirement, is purchasing a pint of milk in a market and is surprised by the price of it. At home, she speaks with her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) during breakfast, however, her husband passed away in 2003. She misses her husband so much, it gives her comfort to believe he is still there in her home. It's a way of trying to keep memories. The staff sees her talking to herself.
 That night, she dresses up beautiful and entertains guests for dinner keeping up her character and staying in good spirits.
  Her daughter reminds her at bedtime that she is no longer the Prime Minister, Mark is in South Africa and her husband is dead. Margaret responds to her daughter, ""You look exhausted, dear"".

  Margaret Thatcher was the longest serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979-90) of 11 years and 209 days and the first female Prime Minister.

 I thought the movie was a bit disrespectful to Margaret Thatcher and I did not like the storyline jumping back and forth to the present and the past so much.

4623972,3,B0059XTUXQ,"If you want to understand Thatcher, if you want to see what motivated her, this is is a waste of time.  If you are interested in an absorbing story about a woman coming to terms with loss, this is a very good psychological drama.  As a movie I quite enjoyed it.  As a story about someone who had power and traded family for it, it is a compelling and interesting drama.  Making it about Margaret Thatcher was just a move to put a name to an interesting story.

As for the story of Margaret thatcher, there is so much that is missing and so  much that was skipped over, ignored, trivialized or just plain missed.  Part of the problem here, of course, is there is not enough time in two hours to cram a worthwhile biography of Thatcher, so any movie will disappoint.  So it seems the writers and director didn't even bother.  There is nothing on why this total outsider took control of the party machinery and ran it like a well drilled regiment for 11 years.  Nor is anything on why they suddenly mutinied on her.  Nor is the much on why the battle with the Coal miners was so important, how she achieved the victory and the hard work involved in preparing for it.  The level of emotional involvement she created is totally missing from the movie.  Read any comment about her on you tube or here on Amazon and you will see even 20 years on that people care a great deal about her and what she did.  How she managed to create that level of involvement both pro and anti is totally missing.

As an interesting drama, this movie is very good.  Ms Streep richly deserved her award for her portrayal of a formerly strong woman coming to grips with the loss of a husband and the fading of her mind.  As history, this is total bunk.",1340236800,,1724,4.304347826086956
4623973,3,B0059XTUXQ,"The Iron Lady is an admirable film which does not, unfortunately, rise above the tour de force performance of the Meryl Streep, the greatest actress of her generation. Unlike the last iconic character Streep portrayed, chef Julia Child, this film (even if it weren't in actuality) seems like a vehicle simply created to showcase Streep. In honoring Thatcher, it succeeds only partially, as it glosses over many important events with mere montages and shows more than a few ugly sides to her character. But Streep is successful in making Thatcher both the object of ire and sympathy (and the Oscar-winning makeup is also incredible). If you want to see an example of a film that could have been great relegated to merely ""average"" status by an impotent script and fairly lazy direction, this is the one for you -- because Streep's performance ensures that it won't be a total waste of time!",1340236800,,889,4.855263157894737

Margaret and Meryl shine bright in this film.  Lady Thatcher, a 20th century icon, proved to be what the doctors ordered for 1980's British economy, a first in more than one way.  She survived the treacherous world of politics at the pinnacle for longer than her predecessors.  Inevitably her time to shine came abruptly to an end but detracts nothing from her many achievements.  Meryl tackles this role with her usual perfectionist gusto and succeeds beyond all expectation.  She is more than believable in the role and brings out Margaret's human side as a wife and Mother as well as senior citizen.

Great leadership points here. She was never one to form a coalition. It is interesting to see her stick to her guns in all situations. She was very black and white. My theory with women in power is that they are more principled and more likely to be a hard liner because they have a safety net. Married women can always return home. In her case she had a supportive husband at home. Men don't have that option. Chauvinist sure but true. As the movie shows the men are more interested in preserving their careers and don't have the luxury of principals. It is an old boy network for a reason. She rocked the boat and won...for a while.

There were four of us watching this we all came away wondering what that was about.  It felt like a Dali painting you know its supposed to be a woman but the parts are all over the place.

The same goes for anyone who has great respect and admiration for Margaret Thatcher and esteems her as one of the best Prime Ministers ever.  Well sorry Charlie; stuff all your high praise in some boxes and tuck them away somewhere safe because your high praise for her will not receive ample justification in this film either.  The film does not take sides. It doesn't offer an definitive or decisive opinion.  The story isn't told from the liberal perspective or the conservative.

Mrs. Thatcher has been suffering from dementia for over 5 years, and yes, she is slowly slipping away.  However, during her entire time in office she was a force to be reckoned with.  Be it war with Argentina or going after the IRA in Northern Ireland, she stood by her convictions and never wavered.

I agree with the other viewers who commented that Margaret Thatcher's politics were glossed over, almost like the filmmakers were detached from the subject. This was disappointing. Yes, they show how she smashed down gender barriers, which was wonderful. But there are other facets to her story which were not realized.

I did like a few things: the cinematography is well done. Meryl Streep gives a performance which others have raved about, and with good reason. She's beautiful and bold; she is not afraid to explore different roles. She portrays Thatcher with quiet grace and strength. Her performance is not enough to lift this film back up though.

While Ms. Streep is her typical fantastic self, the film itself is a bizarre let down.  It starts in around 2008 and shows Ms. Thatcher in a semi-state of dementia.  She has visions of and converses with her dead husband Denis (Jim Broadbent).  Her past life is shown through a series of flashbacks.  The film spends too much time in the present showing her as a frail old woman fighting the demons in her mind then focusing on the potential powerful situations of her being the first woman to lead a country in the Western world. Mr. Broadbent plays his character like a complete loon and you can't understand why someone like that would haunt her mind. That being said, Ms. Streep inhabits the character and transforms herself into Margaret Thatcher completely.  While you can never argue when Ms. Streep wins an award, I thought she was much better in her three most recent nominated roles for Julie & Julia, Doubt and The Devil Wears Prada.

But I was hoping for so much more - an in-depth look at Thatcher's service to her country and the changes she helped bring about. That didn't happen and I was disappointed.

4624052,2,B0059XTUXQ,".... what you're left with is this movie.

Margaret Thatcher had a profound effect on British politics. Not only the first woman prime minister, but also one of the most committed to her viewpoint, she took Britain by the scruff of the neck and shook it up. The changes Thatcher made were enormous, including destroying the coal-mining industry, increasing home ownership by selling off subsidised housing to the tenants, mobilising the country for a war in the Falkland Islands, slashing government spending and many more. Some people were helped by the changes, some hurt, some, such as the union leaders of the mining industry, destroyed. She was intensely, and deliberately, divisive. Her impact was such that the British Labour party completely reinvented itself as 'New Labour', a party unrecognizable from the old Labour party of the 1970s. Thatcher won 3 elections, became the UK's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century and was ultimately thrown out by her own party. Whatever your feelings towards her, she has to be regarded as the single most important political figure in the UK in the second half of the 20th century.

The problem is that this film misses almost all of her impact on society, both positive and negative. Over half the film is given over to an imagined portrait of her in her later years, having conversations with her dead husband. The earlier part of her life is covered in flash-backs, so it lacks continuity and, often, context. In trying to present a portrait of the individual, the film-makers have diminished her actions to a side-issue which is, in her case, entirely inappropriate. Thatcher rarely spoke about her personal feelings and did not let others into her personal life. If ever a person were defined by what she did rather than who she was, it was Margaret Thatcher. The perspective of this movie is all wrong and what should have been a gripping tale of one of the most influential political figures of recent times becomes a rather dreary portrayal of a person in decline.

Meryl Streep has been nominated for 17 Oscars and won 3 times. In my view, pretty well all of the 14 performances which did not win were better than this one. That's not a criticism of Streep, who is the most brilliant female actor of our time and turns in an immaculate performance as always. It's just that the part is so poorly drawn that Streep is hardly able to utilise her magnificent skills to make it come alive. Instead, I was left with the uneasy feeling that her Academy Award was not for acting but for impersonation. Streep has so often made characters compelling and unforgettable that to see her win for what was basically a female version of Rich Little was somewhat galling. I suspect in later years she will not look on this award as her finest achievement by a very long way.

I'd seen the movie before but watched several minutes out of comparative curiosity.  Meryl plays a headstrong Danish baroness/plantation owner in colonial Kenya.  She speaks English with what appears to be a perfect Danish accent.  The woman is remarkable which is also the correct adjective for her role as British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  If not for her performance this film can easily be overlooked and would feel right at home on basic cable.

While Thatcher's rise to power as the first woman prime minister is quite an accomplishment, it doesn't seem to be terribly interesting.  One of the problems is that the meat of her career doesn't begin until she's in her 20's.  There isn't much about her childhood.  All of this comes as the aging, depressed woman teeters on the edge of dementia.  It is those uncomfortable moments we get too much of.  Thatcher's life story would have played better with linear story telling but then we wouldn't have seen so much of the well done make-up artistry and Streep's well played old lady.  Was that the filmmaker's goal?

It's too bad the story, style and script don't meet the standard established by Ms. Streep and the excellent video transfer.  Projected in a wide 2.35:1 aspect ratio in 1080p the film looks great.  Likewise the DTS-HD MA 5.1 is terrific.  Clear and perfectly situated.",1338595200,,1495,4.869047619047619

4624080,3,B0059XTUXQ,"While Meryl Streep deservedly won her third Oscar for her impressive performance as Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a disappointing portrait of this historical figure.
The script focuses on Thatcher's seeming decline into probable dementia accompanied by hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband (a charming performance by Jim Broadbent) rather than illuminating Thatcher's key political crises.  This is all the more surprising since the director is a woman.
Streep is as expected amazing.  There are times it's hard to recognize the actress at all.  THE IRON LADY ultimately emerges as a vehicle for a brilliant performer in a flawed movie.",1338595200,3,655,5.465346534653466

However, it was a chronically poor interpretation of the life and times of Margaret Thatcher. So much is missing. If you do not already have extensive knowledge of Britain and British domestic policy in the 1970s and 80s (which most American audiences will not...) this film will mean nothing to you. The Miner's Strike and her relationships with Arthur Scargill and Ronald Reagan were barely touched upon! Yes, Meryl Streep is a great actor but we already knew that...

""The Iron Lady"" seems to have been made solely to win Streep another Oscar but that is not the reason I go and see movies. The emphasis on the least significant period of Thatcher's life has come at the expense of doing justice to the career of an important individual and a crucial period in Britain's history.

Meryl Streep, who played Thatcher, received Best Actress from the Academy Awards for this picture.

About the only issue I had (and it's a big one) is that they tried to make it appear as if all of her victories didn't mean much in the end when they actually did. One could argue there was a liberal bias in this film that took a few opportunities to slam Thacher when they really weren't justified. Thatcher's children dubbed this film ""a left-wing fantasy"". Anybody who doesn't know what she did for Great Britain should educate themselves about the woman and no I'm not a conservative.

One would expect that a movie chronicling Margaret Thatcher could have come off more fair, more wide scoped, with more scene clarity.

There is no doubt that Meryl Streep astounds with her broad character portrayals.

However, the whole movie left a very down and pathetic portrayal of a woman, who had to have had some ingenious, often tenuous, qualities, insights and talents to get her to the top of the politcal spectrum.

Margaret Thatcher was captured so brilliantly you hardly realize you're really watching Streep. The story line, which is the part most criticized, was just as good in my opinion. I think politics drove most of Hollywood to criticize it b/c they were upset they made a movie about a conservative that at least attempted to be accurate instead of a hit job on lady Thatcher. I do wish they had gone into her record more, but it was still a great movie and well done. If the same movie had been made but about a female liberal this movie would be praised w/ no end.

Streep is so incredible, just a perfect performance in a very interesting and enjoyable movie.

Thumbs up to the makeup artists as well, whose work here is invisible. If you had never seen Meryl Streep before, you'd assume she looks just as she does in this movie.

The cast all around is terrific, the script is tight and interesting. The drama is leavened at times with humor and spirit, at times piercing in its sadness, but always, always interesting.

You might think that they were trying to be artsy-fartsy; however I think it was a thorough lack of movie making skills.

For those who lived through the era they would be disappointed because nothing of any interest or any of the special highlights of Margret's life was displayed. I personally did not mind what was not shown. It was their hodgepodge chopped up moved back and forth through time inconsistent nonsense that not only ruined this film but any film they would've made on any subject. I put the blame squarely on Phyllida Lloyd - Director, Abi Morgan - Writer (screenplay), Damian Jones - Producer, Elliot Davis - Cinematographer, Thomas Newman - Composer, Simon Elliott - Production Designer, and Justine Wright - Editor.

To keep you from having to guess what I'm talking about and actually watch snippets of this movie I'll tell you.

Many events that I think would be worth exploring are passed over too briefly.

As to this DVD release, the movie looks and sounds great, so no complaints there. But I was disappointed by the lack of good special features. I think it would have been nice to include a documentary about the real Thatcher as a supplement. I like when historically-based films include real footage and interviews to illuminate the history and give some background, as this can help the view appreciate what the film did in bringing it to the cinema.

Let me say upfront that I didn't know a single thing about Margaret Thatcher, so I had no preconceived notions on how they were going to portray her or any comment on whether the movie was accurate. That being said, I took the film as it was presented to me, a story about a strong woman in power who is slowly losing her wherewithal to Alzheimer's. The film is told mostly in flashbacks so the viewer can piece together Thatcher's past and her rise to power in England. While I wasn't exactly fond of her, or many of the characters in the film, I thought the acting was divine. Streep has almost always played a kind-hearted woman you would want to befriend. However, this character was more like the character she depicted in Sophie's Choice in which there is a great deal of moral ambiguity. No one these are the two roles that got her Oscars.

Although Meryl Streep  stunningly transforms herself into an aged, confused and alienated woman, I am not convinced that it was an honest portrayal of the truth of  her character or the politics of her time.  After watching Iron Lady, I felt as confused and alienated as Margaret Thatcher must have felt both while in office and afterwards.  I came away from the movie disliking her, her family and the people that she was elected to serve, while at the same time feeling compassion for the hopes and disappointments that they all experienced.  This is also a movie that has stayed with me, if for no other reason than to try to understand why anyone thought that it would humanize someone by focusing so heavily on their mental decline. Maybe if I had personally experienced the woman and her policies, it would make more sense.  Margaret Thatcher evoked strong feelings, both positive and negative, and like her or not, she was a significant influence on the direction that Britain took in the future and should be given a bit more respect than this movie offered.",1337126400,,1143,4.742424242424242

4624242,1,B0059XTUXQ,"For a film called THE IRON LADY this movie was felt more like it was formed from Reynold's wrap. But what else would you expect in a movie made about a Conservative woman by a group of Liberal die hards? Its difficult not to bring politics into a film of this nature since the centerpiece is a politician. But when all that's offered is a one sided description how can you not?

For those who are confused while watching a film that jumps back and forth in time then stop reading and forget this movie. It does that from start to finish and not very well. The object of the movie, the Iron Lady in question, is ex-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, portrayed here by Meryl Streep in an Oscar winning performance. Just another example of why the Oscars mean so little these days.

The film opens with Thatcher in her later years post PM status and after the death of her beloved husband Dennis (Jim Broadbent). At this time Thatcher was dealing with the impending onset of Alzheimer's as well as the loss of the man she so desperately cared for. We watch as she attempts to force herself to part with those things left behind, clothes and the like. And while she does, so various items and things around her home lead her to remember her past.

We get glimpses of young Margaret as she works in her father's store while the other girls walk past. We she her listening and being influenced by her father's speeches to the locals touting the value of a solid business front not willing to cower to the Nazis as they attempt to bomb the country and force the people into hiding. These are the ideas that formed the basis for her beliefs but they are given short time here.

Flash forward as Margaret deals with her daughter or perhaps the other way round. We see her getting ready for a dinner with friends where her opinions are asked but she seems buried in the past and her guests seem more embarrassed than pleased to hear her views. Her daughter acts the same.

Back in time we see how Margaret meets Dennis but not how they fell in love. Margaret decides to take on the establishment and become a female member of Parliament. Her struggles in the face of chauvinism can be seen here with a touch of the problems she faced but more in focus as to the differences in clothing choices, a bright blue dress among a sea of black suits.  Then back to her slow slide into dementia.

The important historic moments in Thatcher's life are touched on but very lightly. Incidents like the Falkland War and the miner's strike feel like they are mentioned without any depth to them. Other items like the Iran hostage situation are ignored completely. With the amount of story involved in Thatcher's life I was left wondering why the film makers here decided that her illness seemed the most interesting part of her life instead of those more interesting historical moments. Then again when thinking about Hollywood's depiction of Conservative figures I recalled the attempt to make Ronald Reagan look senile and mentally ill as well. The friendship between Reagan and Thatcher is barely touched on in this film.

Streep won the Oscar for best actress for her performance here. I am at a loss as to understand why with the exception of the fact that she is Hollywood royalty and is nominated for anything she does these days. I saw little acting here and more impersonation. If that's all it takes to win an Oscar then Rich Little should have had an entire shelf lined with the trophies. I will admit that I've never been a Streep fan up front but this movie did little to change my mind.

It would be nice if folks in Hollywood would take a historical topic and present the facts untarnished by their own viewpoints when making the film. I have little doubt that there were bad things about Thatcher but there were good as well. A movie that would choose to present both sides and let the viewer decide would have been interesting. This movie did little but make you wonder how she stayed PM for 11 years. Then again the movie also made you wonder about her sanity the longer you watched.

To capture an entire life in 105 minutes is difficult at best. To present it accurately and fairly even more so. Some may watch this film and think they've learned about Margaret Thatcher. It only made me want to look deeper into her life as this felt more like fluff than biographical film. The only good thing this movie presented was the love and adoration Thatcher felt for her husband. Even a story revolving solely around that would have made a better film.",1336953600,3,4549,4.529841656516443

She wanted to reduce the climate of populace dependency and inspire citizens to be productive and contributors to the national economy.  Mrs. Thatcher was a visionary and has left an enduring legacy whose efforts reestablished Britain as a world-power and improved its economic position.

4624281,3,B0059XTUXQ,"In Phyllida Lloyd's 2011 film, ""The Iron Lady,"" the ever-accomplished Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep adds another accent to her repertoire of outstanding characters with distinctive speech patterns that mark their identity.  However, it is not the duplication of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's voice cadence that wins her her third Oscar, it is her ability to play a woman in angst with multi-faceted nuance.  As Thatcher, Streep ripples and reels with the passing of time--for most of the film we see her as an aged oldster missing her now deceased husband with not much to check off on the daily to-do list other than seeing doctors, packing off her hubby's clothing and battling hallucinations.  Why Phyllida Lloyd decides to use Thatcher as a case-in-point for the ephemeral nature of success and the poster child for a modern-day Ozymandias lesson in the inevitable decline of any human, great or small, along with whatever empires they build, seems understandable on the surface, but results in a dreary portrait of ""The Iron Lady"" and her myriad of accomplishments within the United Kingdom.

Of course, Streep portrays Thatcher in her dotage with a befuddled excellence that entitles her to be thought of as one of today's most brilliant actresses.  As the older Thatcher, she becomes visually disturbing as her mind meanders, chasing after dreams of yesterday as epitomized by the appearance of her deceased husband (played with panache by Jim Broadbent) who reminds and coaxes her to maintain control of whatever is left of her life.  Seeing Thatcher depicted in this way is almost embarrassing and decidedly irreverent.  Should not the woman who was prime minister of the UK longer than anyone else in its history be allowed the perseverance of her private dignity?

If writer Abi Morgan's motivation for depicting Thatcher from this vantage point is to garner support for dementia-awareness with unsolicited cooperation from the former prime minister in order to show that it can happen to anyone despite one's former glory, this reviewer supposes that both Morgan and director Lloyd accomplish in projecting this theme.  However, the life of any woman would have done just as well to make this point.  Sadly, anyone expecting to understand the climate and politics of her time at the helm of the British nation will see montages of events like the IRA bombings, her battle with the unions and her mission to reclaim the Falkland Islands but will be ultimately disappointed when attempting to discern her contribution with regard to advancements for women and the British world.

Instead of a strong woman who leads an important world nation for over 15 years, the audience sees a woman struggling for her sanity because her physical body is failing.  But what of Thatcher's quick mind?  What of her accomplishments?  Should she not be applauded for her tenacity and ability to stand up to others?  The filmmakers give us a glimpse of this, but focus on Thatcher's deterioration instead of her crested glory.  The resultant film wears thin in the mind of the viewer--the lows are underscored too brutally while the highs are barely explained.

Even though Alexandra Roach bristles as the young Margaret Thatcher--she is all about quenching her thirst for change and getting done what she thinks must get done--this reviewer does not get a sense of who Margaret Thatcher really is.  Instead, the image of Streep as the old woman in a world that has passed her by remains steadfast--a cautionary tale almost Buddhist in its leanings towards the insignificance of the world of politics and materialism.  Why bother to strive when what awaits you is forgetfulness, a body that betrays and death?

Bottom line?  Phyllida Lloyd's depiction of Margaret Thatcher does not contain enough data about this longest serving British prime minister to consider it a biopic.  Instead, the film, sadly, depicts the trials and tribulations of the aged as dementia and other dehabilitating diseases set in.  This ""make hay when the sun shines"" mentality depresses rather than instills ambition or rallies motivation towards world progress in any positive manner.  Streep excels as the aging Maggie, missing her husband, her son and underling the importance of having some purpose to even the longest days.  Recommended only for those who want to see Streep's award-winning performance and realize this is not an upbeat biographic film bullet-pointing Thatcher's actions during her ministry.

It seems the filmmakers had no idea what kind of movie they wanted to make about Margaret Thatcher.  The movie teeters all over the place from Thatcher as a young up and coming.  Thatcher roaming around her house at old age with senility and reminiscing about her previous self as a powerful Prime Minister.  Was the real Margaret Thatcher that fixated on her past and now finding herself approaching death and unable to remember anything for any length of time?  I wanted to like this movie, but it just wouldn't get to the point.  I couldn't handle the back and forth every ten minutes.  Back and forth to nothing.  Meryl Streep rocks in this.

Although the movie shows some earlier parts of her life through flash backs, I would have liked to see more about her time in office. There's a little about her as she's growing up and just getting into politics but not nearly enough scenes showing her as Prime Minister which I think would have been fascinating. Too much time, in my opinion, was spent on the part of her life that is the least interesting - the onset of her dementia from Alzheimers. Jim Broadbent was fantastic as usual and the rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job.

Like many other reviewers I grew weary of the hallucinations and would have preferred a simple telling of Lady Thatcher's fascinating life and politics.  I never felt as if we got a chance to know anyone in the movie, including Thatcher herself.  The only version we see consistently is the Thatcher suffering from dementia.  I find that insulting.

Instead, we are treated to the ""memories"" of a pathetic old woman, with dementia, who once was a significant historical figure.
I will admit up front that I am a long tome admirer of Lady Thatcher; if that colors my review, so be it, but I am trying to be objective.
This awful travesty  of filmaking seems to revel in it's emphasis on Thatcher as she sadly is today, rather than exploring her difficult rise to the top of the Conservative Party , being not just a woman, but the daughter of a grocer! Quelle horreur! Her triumphs seem to be portrayed grudgingly, but her failures almost celebrated.
Obviously, Lady Thatcher was, and remains a divisive figure, both in the UK and elsewhere; most historic, transformative figures are as well. Yet this film fails to answer both the how, and the why of it's subject.

4624343,3,B0059XTUXQ,"While I deeply wanted to love this movie, I instead felt mostly ambivalent about it.  Margaret Thatcher's younger self alternates with a portrait of her as dementia sets in (this is no spoiler but clear nearly from the outset of the film).

This contrast of past and present can be effective - but not in this film. Streep musters on gamely and evokes Thatcher's character as much as possible within the limits of the script. I was frankly puzzled by how much of the film focused on Thatcher's decline and confusion rather than her most powerful moments in history. It seemed a waste.

This isn't an absolute wreck of a film. Certain moments ring true. When Thatcher becomes prime minister  and walks through a sea of men, one feels for Thatcher. Streep conveys Thatcher's resolute nature and presence and her uncertainty about her chances of becoming prime minister. She has to be convinced this is actually possible when her stated goal is only to shake up things. .

The movie is unfortunately quite slow and feels like a dull documentary instead of the riveting historical account it could have been. As my son and I watched it, he got very little feel for the history of the time and was left mostly with the impression of a confused older woman who had fleeting memories from her past.",1336262400,,1291,4.669603524229075

I knew very little about Margaret Thatcher before watching The Iron Lady & was hoping for a much better historical account of her place in Brittish & world politics.  Politics aside, she was a strong & remarkable woman. I feel terribly sad for her that a film maker chose her dementia to be the most intriguing tale of her life.

Her struggle to leave No. 10 Downing Street was quite obvious as she and late husband Denis (although dead- but still alive in her mind) are going back to remembering achievements- Her election in May 1979, the Falkland Islands War (1982), the Cutting back on Spending so that the UK would not go bankrupt and above all, her unwillingness to not back down- ""The Lady's Not for turning"".

Margaret Thatcher was an extremely private person, yet about 75% of the movie deals with Margaret Thatcher's later years of life as she adjusts to life without her husband, and her deteriorating mental health.

Once again, she totally embodies the character and you really believe her in the role.  My issue was that I didn't feel it was a very fleshed-out portrayal of Thatcher.

The movie is set up as flashbacks.  She is now an old woman, who has lost her husband and seems to suffer from some kind of dementia.  You see flashbacks of her as a young woman, a mother of twins and in her role as Englands first and only Prime Minister.  The movie just didn't really delve very deep and it was very sad to watch her as an old woman, just a shadow of the strong ""iron"" woman she once was.  What I felt was the best part of the movie was the overwhelming love that she and her husband shared and through her time as the prime minister she could come across tough as nails and then sit at a desk writing personal letters to families that had lost loved ones in the Falklands, showing her vulnerable and maternal side.

I didn't love it or hate it.  She did a fantastic job but I would have liked to have learned more about her from a younger age through her time as Prime Minister. A fuller story line was really what Streep deserved for her stellar performance.

So, for fans of Streep, you might want to check out her Oscar winning performance, but for those looking for a great movie about Thatcher, you can probably take a pass.",1336176000,,1541,4.356643356643357
4624388,3,B0059XTUXQ,"I wanted to like this movie, I really, really did. The cast was great, the provenance hallowed...... but - the movie was alternately confusing, dull and baffling. The idea of presenting the life of Margaret Thatcher through the use of flashbacks from an old, and dementia afflicted Mrs. Thatcher must have been an exciting concept. However, the reality was confusing, boring and difficult to follow.

 There is a far better version of the life of Margaret Thatcher, another unique approach to the life of Margaret Thatcher, but one that works: ""The Rise and Fall of Margaret Thatcher"". This is a sterling BBC production, using 3 actresses ( Andrea Riseborough, Patricia Hodge, Lindsay Duncan) to portray a very accurate representation of Mrs. Thatcher's life. I would highly recommend this 2 disc set to anyone wishing to learn more about Mrs. Thatcher and her times.

Meryl Streep tried her best, all of the actors gave it their best, but -""The Iron Lady"" just did not pull it off. The flashback sequences representing the life of an aged Mrs. Thatcher and a young Mrs. Thatcher, at the height of her power, just did not work. Denis Thatcher was presented as more of a clown and buffoon in his many appearances in the hallucinations of the old Mrs. Thatcher. I felt cheated by the lack of an accurate historical representation of the ""Thatcher Era"". The movie seemed to demean Mrs. Thatcher, love her or hate her... she was a very interesting politician. She served during some very historic times in Britain, none of that is accurately presented in this film. I am not and was not a fan of Mrs. Thatcher, but she was a very interesting person. This film does not reflect the complexities of the life of Mrs. Thatcher. Buy the BBC DVD set, you will be much better served by that version of the Thatcher years in the UK.

4624389,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep portrays the leading role of one of the most well known politicians of the most pivotal periods in history, the Cold War.  ""Iron Lady"" is a moving picture of England's most influential and at times controversial leaders Margaret Thatcher who fittingly inherits the name of being an ""iron lady"" with a domineering female presence amidst an environment of male counterparts.  The film depicts her rise as a young politician that weaves within a collage of memories of her personal and professional life.

The movie is somewhat of a love play of Thatcher's career but most of all her love for her husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent) and family, especially her daughter Carole (Olivia Colman) and though not shown within the film except in flashbacks her absent son Matthew.  During the opening scenes of the film, one must orient one's self with what exactly is happening in the kitchen between Thatcher and her husband.  This is a moment in Thatcher's life as well as one of the focal points of the storyline of the film depicting her twilight years.  Director Phylla Lord and Writer Abi Morgan do a good job interplaying the film's storylines of the life of Margaret Thatcher.  There are moments in the film that may take time to understand amidst the history that most know of Thatcher during the Reagan Years and her personal life that only now, unless one has followed every point of her life, the film sheds a light upon.  While watching the film, viewers may think of other biopics that take an extremely intimate approach towards showing the humanistic aspects of almost larger than life figures.  There are qualities of the film that bears similarities to the film ""Iris"" or ""The King's Speech,"" each depicting notable figures in English history.

But what one may come out of watching the film despite parallels with other biopics, it is an interesting movie that takes an unpredictable approach to delving into the life of a woman that made an enormous impact to the world during the most tumultuous times in twentieth century history.

Photographs, music, and TV programs serve to remind the declining old woman of her younger years and her glory days of Prime Minister.  Unfortunately this plotting device devotes too much time to her hallucinations--going through the same sort of imaginings again and again--especially those in which she conjures up the presence of her late husband.  This time would have been better spent on detailing her personal life and work in Parliament and as Prime Minister--or even her younger days as a shopkeepers daughter.  They also would have done well to show her interacting with her friend ""Ronny"" Reagan--an aspect of her tenure as PM that seems to have been all but forgotten here.

Despite this awkward and tedious retrospective framework, this movie has moments that shine--for which we can thank consummate actress Meryl Streep.  I especially enjoyed the part where she acts on the advice of her political advisers and works to remake herself into someone who the voters can better respond to, and who they could imagine as Prime Minister.

4624435,3,B0059XTUXQ,"MOVIE REVIEW #30  (DVD): "" The Iron Lady ""

Meryl Streep having been nominated for an Academy Award 17 times and winning 3, this movie being her third win for playing the Historic figure, Margaret Thatcher! Her performance is amazing. It's detailed and extremely subtle. Broadly gentle and very honest in what ends up being the end of her life. I understand why she was nominated and why she won! With the make-up, movements and emotion...she was Margaret Thatcher.

However, Director Phyllidia Lloyd may not have the chops this type of drama film. It was slow to start and has the style of seeing the legendary English leader going through her daily routine as an elderly, dementia stricken woman - by going back and forth with flashbacks brought on by her old pics, memorabilia, news clippings and even clothing. Director Lloyd did a much better job directing Mama Mia.  The fast paced, toe-tapping, gotta-sing-along, movie musical with the ABBA soundtrack!

What makes this movie passable and worth waiting for is the performances; once you get to them! Thatcher's husband Denis, played humorously by the brilliant Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, Moulin Rouge, Indiana Jones) makes their partnership - both in life and death extremely heartfelt.

Other amazing performances included those by Anthony Head (Merlin, Buffy The vampire Slayer) who was the Parliament President and that of Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Corpse Bride) who played Parliament's lead man. The two against Meryl were engaging to say the least.

Overall the screenplay, written by Abi Morgan (from British TV) like the film, is a little slow handed. The pieces of controversy over English issues with her people and the Falkland Islands became great dialogue scenes with anger, frustration and why Thatcher was coined `The Iron Lady' by the Russians. If anything the performances and inside view of history that Margaret Thatcher made, make this film worth watching. I can see why she won the Oscar and the other performances were nominated....but I can also see why the rest of the picture wasn't nominated as film overall. Meryl is definitely worth it as is the rest of the cast. There is a great ensemble of actors in this film.....just takes a little while to get to those scenes!",1336003200,2,2267,5.013297872340425
4624436,4,B0059XTUXQ,"I personally knew very little of Margaret Thatcher going into this film.  I remembered seeing her on the news quite a bit during the 80's but beyond that she seemed to vanish from the media in the years after her tenure as Prime Minister.  So, I went into this movie open-minded and without any bias towards her actual life versus this film.  I can say that Meryl Streep is amazing and brings to life many of the memories I do have of Thatcher and her mannerisms.  Streep plays the hard-nosed conservative tough but with the tender delicacies of a proper and ladylike woman as well.  But, do not overlook the performance of Alexandra Roach.  I found her role of the young Margaret at times to be equally sympathetic, even as much as Streep's.  Her surefooted tone of defiance in the face of status quo womanhood are among the best scenes in the film.

The movie relies heavily upon not only Thatcher's background in politics, but also her unspoken thoughts of her family - which could be among the highest of conjecture - but still was quite moving.  Her relationship with her husband is among the keys to how this film decided to disect the motives of Thatcher.

I found the historical references during her times as PM to be among the most grounded, yet those parts move by quite quickly and lead us back to her internal struggles.  Though the external nature of such a high political position is usually shown equal to the internal, here it seems more dilluted.  I would've preferred to see more of the head of state to state sit downs, international political maneuvering.

In the end the film does strike a good balance of showing her as a triumphant giant among men, yet also the humanistic reflection of everyday people.  This film would be very interesting for those that enjoy biographical films, historical time pieces, and political dramas.  I enjoyed this film a lot more than what I expected and what other reviewers had mentioned of it.

4624439,3,B0059XTUXQ,"It's hard to put into words how I feel about ""The Iron Lady,"" Phyllida Lloyd's non-tradional biopic of English prime minister Margaret Thatcher.  On the one hand, I think it's non-linear approach is one of its assets.  We certainly get a sense of Thatcher's career, her rise and fall, her defining moments, if you will; but they're presented almost as flashbacks, in pr&eacute;cis form.  The dementia-addled Thatcher is looking back on her life and it's all a jumble, almost a blur.  This is how memory actually is, and I enjoyed how Lloyd and screen writer Abi Morgan played with the audience's expectations.  Much of the film makes little sense, with characters slipping into and out of Thatcher's consciousness, particularly her dead husband Denis.  The surreal elements work quite well, in my opinion.  What doesn't is everything else, including Meryl Streep's Academy Award-winning performance.

Yes, I know this is sacrilege.  We must love everything that Streep does because she is Streep.  But to me she takes a two-note approach: she's either befuddled (old Maggie) or bitchy (middle-aged Maggie), there's no in between.  (Alexandra Roach, playing the young Thatcher, is one of the few actors here who finds any kind of nuance in what's they're doing.)  Streep provides a pitch perfect impersonation of Thatcher, and it's fun to watch.  But as for presenting a fully rounded human being with flaws and insecurities?  Not here, I'm afraid.  And maybe Thatcher had none...but I doubt it.

Ultimately, though, Streep can only do what the filmmaker and writer ask of her, and she's sorely let down.  The best that can be said about Lloyd's direction is that she shows greater skills than she did on ""Mamma Mia.""  The film has no point of view and seems particularly unclear about how we, as an audience, are supposed to feel about Thatcher.  Watching anyone go through Alzheimer's is sad and difficult, of course, but it's not enough.  What made Thatcher tick, why was she who she was?  The film never even asks those questions, let alone tries to answer them.  It's an exercise in biography that's more about show than substance.",1335830400,,2135,4.971751412429379

Also, the fact that the film is told from the perspective of flashbacks from a senile Margaret Thatcher was almost, in my opinion, unflattering to her.  The film is called The Iron Lady yet they chose to show her at her weakest moments: having hallucinations about her dead husband, Denis.  Denis was charmingly portrayed by Jim Broadbent.  I don't want it to seem as if I'm bashing the entire film because I'm not.  The other actors gave solid performances as well as Ms Streep.  I especially enjoyed seeing Anthony Head in a film again.",1335744000,,966,4.5

Yes, those are important things for a movie that deals with someone's life.  But the overwhelming issue with this movie is even more basic;  it's just a dreadfully boring movie.  Furthermore, this lamest of movies is exacerbated by the terrible method of film making (at least in this case) where the scenes go from the present (ie demented state) to the past.
2.  Bottomline:  to all potential folks interested in watching this movie (and it doesn't matter if your liberal, conservative or unclear), just do yourself a huge favor and bypass this movie because it's just simply boring and semi-confused.",1335744000,2,743,4.935483870967742

We rented this movie via Amazon ($2.00 cheaper than iTunes!) and I'm glad we did, as this is not the kind of movie I would ever want to see again.

Enough cannot be said about Meryl Steep's acting talent. She does not just turn in a good performance. She transcends the role.

Absolutely everything, down to her eye movements, mouth gestures, sloping shoulders, voice projection, her gait and hand movements, were utterly convincing.

For any young actor, this movie should be a master class on how subtly can be more profound than exaggeration when it comes to bringing a character to life.

And the supporting cast was equally brilliant.

The cinematography was carried out with equal expertise. With its slightly dark hue, the picture quality had a real texture to it that simply transports you back to that time period.

Some have complained about the movies shortcomings, and they were expecting this and that and the other. I say leave your expectations at the door and appreciate not only Meryl Streep, but a cast and crew of professionals at the top of their game. Here, here!",1335657600,5,970,4.95679012345679
4624467,5,B0059XTUXQ,"To get it out of the way: Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing in this movie. She *is* Margaret Thatcher. I mean, I grew up with Thatcher being in power and used to see her on the news all the time, and Streep's performance is just so authentic -- no wonder she won an Oscar for it. I might have given the movie five stars just for her.

But actually there's much more to be said for the film. For one thing, the relationship between Margaret and her husband Dennis is depicted in a wonderfully tender and touching way, making her so much more human than she used to appear in the news media. For that matter, it is a great testament to Dennis Thatcher as well, who kept himself in the background during his wife's political career but lovingly supported her and gave her strength.

The political events of Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister structure the movie nicely and anchor it in the viewer's own experience (assuming he or she is old enough to have witnessed them firsthand). Especially refreshing is the scene with Thatcher and US Secretary of State Alexander Haig (though I have to say the actor looked nothing like Haig) in which the latter tries to dissuade her from going to war over the Falklands.

The most moving aspect of the film is, of course, Thatcher's struggle with dementia and her husband's passing. The back and forth between her successful if contentious political life in the 1970s and 80s and her difficulties in coping with everyday matters now set this issue in particularly tragic relief. While I had always admired Thatcher for her powerful and unwavering personality, and particularly for blasting her own path through male-dominated British politics, I (like many others) always thought of her as rather cold and unfeeling. Well, I can't say that now.

This movie will entertain you, teach you a thing or two about recent British history, and make you think about power, love, age, and decline. A wonderful combination.",1335657600,5,1951,4.763313609467455

I doubt that much of it was even true.  Was this in a way sexist?  It reminded me how the rumor began that Thatcher and the Queen were very much at odds with each other.  Both denied it.  Thatcher said the story of two powerful women being at odds with each other was just too good not to make up. I think that pretty much applies to most of this movie.  Streep of course was awesome.

This movie is ALL about attacking through stealth and then dismissing Thatcher's reality in her prime.  Streep gets to act without compromising her biased, flawed, poorly educated, alliterate, and poorly experienced ethics.

Here is an idea for your next hatchet job, uh, I mean film.  Call it ""Lincoln a man with a problem.""  Then have Pee Wee Herman play him in the last half hour of his life.  No flashbacks and no prior scenes are needed.  You don't even have to provide context.

The bed scenes will be riveting and the makeup will be tremendous.  Pee Wee's lack of interest in the character's true strengths will not show since he can play a man who is comatose.  You can have various people visit him and make negative racist comments about him to satisfy your need to attack someone.  Make it on a budget of about ten dollars.

I rarely tune out during a movie, and didn't expect to on this one, but I did. It's a real shame as the actresses were great. It totally deserves the number of one star reviews it is getting.

It is a very interesting movie about Prime Minister Thatcher's life and political career in an era when women weren't typically in political office.

Unfortunately, things didn't go so well for Margaret Thatcher in ""The Iron Lady."" What could have been an intriguing jaunt through the life of Britain's first and only female prime minister somehow became a cluttered mess of selected snapshots randomly thrown together with no apparent rhyme or reason.

The one thing that I can't pick apart is Meryl Streep's performance. She is excellent as the driven woman who stood against all opposition to rise above and do her duty.

It's hard to gauge ""The Iron Lady"" (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy). I found the movie itself to be a cinematic mess as far as pacing and structure. On the other hand, all of the actors performed marvelously and it looks beautiful. There are special features, but they're rather short for the most part.

The movie opens with Thatcher as an elderly woman.  Then it flashes back to her childhood, when she got into Oxford and when she met Denis Thatcher.  My problem is the back and forth between elderly woman and MP and Prime Minister.  They spent too much time on her as an elderly woman and less on her rise in Parliament.  Also, they kept bringing Denis' ghost back after he died and that really confused things!

Don't waste your money buying this.  Nothing against Streep, but she should have had some input into the screenplay.  They didn't touch much on her political career at all.  They didn't explore her friendship with Reagan or her relationship with the Queen.  Get this on DVD.  It's not worth the money and I wish I hadn't bouught it.

Wonderful work, and I'm glad she was recognized, wondering if her award also hints at her body of work that's been ""un"" awarded.

That said, I give a big thumbs down to the approach the writers/director took to telling Thatcher's story.  A previous post suggested that perhaps those who made the film strongly disagreed with Thatcher's politics.  I think they're onto something.  There was no emotional connection, little attempt to humanize or show a believable personal struggle beyond a silhouette of Streep resting head on clenched hands at a desk.  There's simply no evidence that the filmmakers liked any part of this woman or her story.  The nearly two hours was little more than snapshots of historical moments that are already known...no insight or revelation about her, her cabinet, her family.  It felt like watching a lazy book report that basically retold too much of what we already know.  And yes, love or hate her, I think it disrespectful and odd to anchor the story in the present day -- while she's still alive -- with the assumption that she's wandering around her home passing her days in dementia-induced flashbacks being whispered and worried about by caretakers.",1335225600,2,1356,4.960176991150442

If it wasn't for Meryl Streep and her superb impersonation, this movie would have been doomed to failure. If they had any sensibility and compassion they would not have portrayed her as a senile, hallucinating old woman who talks to her dead husband, which was totally demeaning and hurtful at best.  Granted they touched lightly on her Political life, but unfortunately it came through as part of her hallucinations.
 Frankly, I was expecting something more in the line of ""A Woman Called Golda"", where Mrs. Thatcher's lifetime of work, her Political career, her numerous challenges, her victories and defeats not to mention the enormous changes she brought to UK would have been portrayed in their glory, without taking away foibles of her humanity. It should just have been a tribute to Thatcher years not the imaginary impressions and conceptions of the production staff, who wouldn't even take the time to research their project properly.

4624501,2,B0059XTUXQ,"Margret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) is in the final years of her life. She suffers from dementia and often carries on conversations with her husband who has been dead for 8 years. She has many flashbacks to her younger years when she went to Oxford University and had a desire to go into politics. She was the daughter of a grocer who was also the mayor in the town in which they lived.

She had a hard and focused personality but she has declined to the point where she needs constant care, supervision and protection. Her political successes came as she won three elections for Prime Minister of England and the leader of the Conservative Party for over 11 years......

This movie has a major asset, the acting of Meryl Streep, who once again proves that she is possibly the best character actor of all time. Beyond her amazing performance this movie suffers for many reasons. Hollywood likes to take pot shots at leaders and this is no different. Margret Thatcher hated Socialism and Communism and fought to keep England a democratic and market driven country thriving on the intellect and inventiveness of its people. In the movie she is vilified (as she was during her career) but unfortunately this movie only seems to focus on vilifying her and illustrating her Alzheimer's and dementia.

The most powerful women in political history also had as many admirers as those who hated her policies. She broke the unions and fought the government from printing money just to be more socialistic. The unions wanted a 30% pay increase. England was going into debt and high inflation was rampant. She helped lead them back to stability and financial security. She believed in taking action and fighting for what was right. She wanted to do something to make the world better rather than just trying to be someone.

This movie was focused on belittling Margret Thatcher and depicting her as an old lady severely ill and as a bully when she was Prime Minister. Over 50% of the film was focused on her dementia instead of the powerful influence she had on the world. She was one of the leaders who helped stop the cold war with Russia but this topic was hardly even touched!

The acting of Meryl Streep was superb but the script and story line was shameful. Hollywood does it again! This movie is not worth seeing for the story but the acting of Streep is the hook that will make you want to see it!",1335139200,,2389,4.638297872340425
4624502,2,B0059XTUXQ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

No matter how good an actor's performance is (and in this case, Meryl Streep's performance is excellent), if the script is weak, the movie as a whole, cannot work. And that's what's happened with 'The Iron Lady'. Director Phyllida Lloyd and Screenwriter Abi Morgan want it both ways. On one hand, they have a great reverence for Margaret Thatcher as a feminist pioneer who became Britian's first female prime minister. On the other hand, being liberals, they've got to be uncomfortable with Thatcher's conservative political stance (to many liberals, in her heyday, Thatcher was viewed as a modern day 'Marie Antoinette').

On the surface, Lloyd and Morgan have produced a fairly standard biopic--a hagiography of sorts, touching on Thatcher's storied political career. But I would argue that because of their unease with Thatcher's belief system, they unconsciously attempt to disparage her. Lloyd and Morgan end up focusing on Thatcher in her old age, ravaged by Alzheimer's, and a shell of her former self. Thatcher is now transformed into a tragic figure, and whatever Lloyd and Morgan's underlying intentions, the net effect is to constantly remind us that a woman who once was a firebrand, has now been taken down quite a few pegs.

It's one thing to deal with the reality of Thatcher's dementia, but to focus on it, as the main focus of the film, that's a big mistake. Why do we have to be constantly reminded of Thatcher's fall from grace? This could be a story about ANYONE with Alzheimer's! The Weinstein Brothers already covered the subject matter with their 2001 film, 'Iris' starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent (note Broadbent shows up here in virtually the same kind of role--the understanding husband who must cope with a wife in sad decline!) . And yes we know that Alzheimer's is a terrible thing but to knock us over the head scene after scene (with Thatcher experiencing hallucinations of her dead husband), that takes away from the material we're really interested in: Thatcher's rise to power and subsequent political career.

Granted, it is a tall order to turn the story of Thatcher's political career into compelling drama; but Abi Morgan is clearly not up to the task. What the script lacks is basic conflict, with a recognizable external arc, culminating in a resolution to the protagonist's dark moment. 'The Iron Lady' works best when Thatcher battles her allies in the Conservative party, but those moments are fleeting. Her opponents are underdeveloped--on for such a short time that the film feels more like a History Channel biography than full fledged drama. Instead, we're treated to archival footage, chronicling the frenzied opposition to Thatcher's policies through the years, as well as realistic (but again, short) scenes in Parliament, where we never get to know any of the Labor opponents as fleshed out characters.

Individual scenes do occasionally work. When a bespectacled Harry Lloyd (the young Denis Thatcher) proposes to Alexandra Roach (the young Margaret), the young actors capture the unbridled innocence of the young couple about to embark on their life's journey. The two scenes involving violence also work, which include Thatcher witnessing the assassination of a political mentor and surviving an IRA bombing with her husband, while staying a hotel for a political conference. The Falklands War is covered in the style of a standard biopic but we do learn interesting details as to Thatcher's reaction to the conflict (she writes personal letters to the families of each soldier killed). Finally, there's a powerful scene (albeit somewhat clichd), as Thatcher witnesses her husband's death, as he disappears into white light.

Despite Streep's bravura performance, one feels that she acts in isolation. Undoubtedly, Thatcher's rise was dependent on a myriad of relationships, which are only touched on briefly here. What's more, the film's scenarists avoid taking a stand on many of her controversial policies, preferring to retreat to the generic portrait of Alzheimer's victim.

In the end, we find out it was Thatcher's obstinacy that led to her political downfall. She ended up alienating her very own conservative party members, who couldn't stand her lack of flexibility and harsh, demanding work habits.

Somewhere, there's a story here but not in the confused recollections of a sad woman, plagued with dementia. The rich tapestry of British political life from 1979 to 1990 is glossed over as we're treated to The Iron Lady's career from the outside in, instead of the inside out.",1335052800,3,4589,5.133868808567604

However she had good memories and very proud achievements to reflect on, and at least for me made me reflect a bit on what I may be like in 40 more years if I live that long.  The bits with her husband, and her children I thought brought her humanity to the stage, and not just the political achievements she had.

FOR MUCH BETTER, ABOUT MS THATCHER:
START WITH
Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Long Walk to Finchley (BBC) - UTube (90min)
This is about young Ms Thatcher up to the point of getting elected to Parliament, at that time she was the first and only female. This was a long, difficult ordeal for her with MANY defeats, in a Brit-version of the Good-ole-boys club.

NEXT GOTO the Documentary-style:
Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Downing Street Years - also on UTube (4hours)
This series shows pretty clearly why she is a Conservative's Dream Politician
She had utter, and unshakable confidence and belief in herself, and like Reagan, GWB, Cheney, didn't believe in ever questioning her assumptions.
AND her only interest was in being effectively a dictator.

But, cinematically speaking, it was the majestic ""The Iron Lady"" which received better praise due to the complexity and significance of the story, as it magnificently captures the rise and fall of England's first female Prime Minister.

Meryl Streep, who won the Best Actress Academy Award, plays Margaret Thatcher, and we first meet her in her later years, when she is showing the first signs of senility. She is aging and is constantly disturbed by the imaginary presence of her late husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). She spends the time - screen time, that is - remembering her younger years during World War II, when she used to work at her father's grocery store; how her father taught her how to be strong; and her years attending Oxford University. She is shown as a young woman with strong convictions, trying to accomplish something meaningful in life, saying at one time, ""I can not die washing up a tea cup!"" Margaret Roberts marries Denis Thatcher and soon they become parents. She goes into politics and becomes a Member of Parliament, eventually reaching the post of Prime Minister, being the first woman in holding that position. From then on, of course, we witness Thatcher dealing with a myriad of issues, including economic crises, clashes with the IRA, the Falklands war, and the end of the cold war. In every case, her motto was ""We will stand on principle, or we will not stand at all.""  This stance caused her some enemies inside and outside England.

""The Iron-Lady"" is a well-documented and to-the-point film, and Meryl Streep shines in the main role, taking into consideration that she had to speak the Queen's English. I have to say, however, that there is something about Margaret Thatcher that I never liked. I am not sure what it is, but I believe that it may be the fact that, ""standing on principle,"" and perhaps to show character and determination, she chose to go to war for possession of an island far away from England, and with no apparent strategic significance, just to make a point. As I write this, there is another movement in Argentina claiming that the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) belong to them. At times, too, watching Streep with all the impressive make-up, as well as some of her facial movements, reminded me of Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest."" The delightful Blue-ray + DVD + Digital copy edition also includes a making-of documentary, as well as some features about the costumes, Denis Thatcher, English politics, and more.

4624533,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Critics don't like this movie because they expect it to dwell at length on the political philosophy and on the issues Margaret Thatcher dealt with as prime minister of Britain. They expect the Iron Lady to be a glorified docudrama, but that is not what this film is. It is the story of the personal life of Margaret Thatcher before, during, and after her tenure as prime minister. By that measure, and by virtue of Meryl Streep's acting skill, it is a jolly good show.",1334880000,,468,4.517647058823529
4624534,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Why was this movie made? It is a confused jumble of scenes of Streep playing Margaret Thatcher as a long retired, senile eldely woman. That she was elected Prime Minister three times, survived IRA assassination attempts, was a long time friend and ally of President Ronald Reagan, is all relegated to the back third of the movie.

This is arrogant Hollywood nonsense. If a ""biopic"" of Reagan or PM Tony Blair were treated this way, it would draw anger or laughter. Instead, Streep wins an Oscar for a farce.

Whether the viewer was a supporter or opponent, she was a dominant political figure. You wouldn't know it from this mess. A younger generation will skip it all together having no idea what they are watching. What a missed opportunity.

Maybe the backroom script battles should have been filmed instead.",1334793600,9,811,4.820143884892087
4624555,2,B0059XTUXQ,"The reviews of this film are all over the board. Meryl Streep is a stellar actress and won an Academy award for this movie This is likely because of both her acting ability and perhaps for the outstanding makeup (the makeup team also won an Academy Award) portraying her at different points in her life. The movie was sad and I feel injured part of her image portraying her dementia and more so because of her transition from idealistic and innocent child like, beliefs, turning into inflexibility and an apparent autocratic leadership style. Margaret Thatcher did serve 11 years as Prime Minister, which with the volatile form of British government, will likely never be surpassed. The movie itself is somewhat slow and boring and the snippets of Thatcher's youth, growth and transition into politics in no way covered her live. However, only an indepth historical biographical book could. So in all fairness, that is to be expected.",1334793600,,934,4.955414012738854

4624557,2,B0059XTUXQ,"If I knew nothing about Margaret Thatcher I would not have learned anything of significance from this film except that old age can be a negative, lonely experience where you have constant, quick glimpses of segments in your life. Yes, this movie was like a bad dream and Margaret was old 90% of the time. Not even engagingly old, charming, wise or humorous. There was no positive to it. I give Meryl Streep a 10 for her taking this part in such an unremarkable movie, probably trying to save it and the director a -1 for not developing the character(s) at all. And who in the world wrote it??? I could get more from a book report. There were so many flash-backs and flash-forwards there was no time to make a commitment, judgment or emotional connection to the character, or anyone for that matter. I kept thinking from the beginning, ""it's the directors fault, whoever directed this doesn't like Margaret Thatcher."" It was one of those movies, you know the kind, where you can tell right away it isn't going to get better.

Even for a political film it was disappointing. Where are Margaret Thatchers rousing speeches that made the people of England rise up and vote for her? None were in this film. Snatches of her philosophy that ""your life should count for something"" was in the script but how she made a poignant difference is not, there is a void, again, her legacy is missing. Some of it is 'mentioned', but mentioning is a far cry from feeling her successes. The Trailer preview is an absolute lie! You think the movie will be about a great woman, the First Woman Prime Minister of England! It's going to be exciting, glorious and uplifting!!! That's the lie. The Hair-do in the Trailer, the Confident, In Control Margaret Thatcher?: she's not in this movie. You do get to see her hallucinatory old age thru the whole uneventful thing, with dead husband Dennis showing up constantly, but again, no warmth is felt although you can say intellectually he loved her. Big deal. I don't know about you but I watch movies to be moved in some way.

If you watch this movie all you'll feel is regret and that you should write a review to warn others. Dennis was a happily encouraging and playful sort, but again, too much, wearily too much of him so that he became an overbearing nuisance early on. The camera angles were strange and dizzying adding nothing to the bland, passionless scenes. Meryl Streep did not have even ONE instance to really shine and show her remarkable talent, not one time, that's how bad this script is. Because if anyone can pull off and save a bad scene it's Meryl, but there was nothing to work with. Most scenes are in seconds, so look fast... The ending was apropos; don't worry I'm not spoiling anything... she walks down her hall in her house for no apparent reason, we don't know why, we don't care by now, because the movie said nothing and lead up to even less.",1334707200,9,2895,4.565384615384615
4624558,5,B0059XTUXQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher. She was portrayed as she would have wanted to be. In the movie, we had the opportunity to travel through her grief experience as she said goodbye to her husband - a privilege few have. She was a remarkable woman who lived her life according to her beliefs. Streep portrayed her as she was - authoritarian, autocratic, a bit arrogant. Streep gave insight into the inner mind and heart of Thatcher.",1334707200,,453,4.746835443037975
4624559,2,B0059XTUXQ,"i think the director and/or screenwriter may well have killed Ms Streep's chances for an Oscar for this performance but for Harvey Weinstein's relentless campaigning for Oscar votes for her. It really defeats the purpose of honoring her career to show her in her dotage, talking at length with her long dead husband Denis or ""DT"" as she calls him, who seems much more alive in Jim Broadbent's caricature of him in death than he was in real life. I think the idea of praising someone so controversial was simply too much for those who still don't like her but wanted to do a movie about her, thus the emphasis on the less glamourous items and of course, the sexism. It's odd to see her play that card so often when as her media advisors point out, that was her ""trump card,"" as she would never have been PM Heath's secretary of state for education, her first Cabinet post, had she not been a woman. All said, it's a good effort at a balanced view but less now and more then would have helped. Also, she doesn't quite get the British knack for mispronunciation of words, like saying ""Himalaya"" instead of the British ""Him-al-ya.""",1334707200,,1127,4.529411764705882
4624560,3,B0059XTUXQ,"If you check the reviews of The Iron Lady, they are decidedly mixed and leaning toward lackluster at best. Critics and amateur reviewers alike seem to agree that the execution of the material is decidedly lukewarm. The comments of the major critics such as Roger Ebert and A O Scott of the New York Times seem to agree quite well with amateur reviewers on Amazon where the reviews are almost evenly split between ratings of one through five.

The film depicts Ms Thatcher's life and career from the time before her marriage through the middle of the last decade after her husband's death and after she had developed what appears to be Alzheimer's disease.  Much of the film depicts imaginary moments and conversations with her late husband. She is attempting to discard his clothing and genuinely seems to want to let him go at times; but at times he is still living to her even though she is reminded constantly by her daughter that he is not.

The story is told through a series of flashbacks. Since the film chronicles such a long period of time, the viewer is often left wishing he or she had learned more about many of the pivotal events of Ms Thatcher's life and career ... things that may have better explained her extreme and often controversial conservatism. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the film does indeed illuminate much of what I personally did not know about Ms Thatcher.

The bright spot of the film is, of course, the performance by Meryl Streep . She delivers another stellar portrayal of a character not at all like herself. As in most of Ms Streep's films, you stop seeing Ms Streep early on and see the character that she is playing. This is particularly true of this film since as an older Margaret, Ms Streep looks nothing like herself. What a grand actress she is! For me she is the epitome.

As I post my review on Amazon, I will give this film a rating of three stars; but that is only because it's the middle point of the rating scale. Ms Streep's performance deserves at least a five; but parts of the film deserve a one. A three is the best I can do.",1334707200,3,2087,4.51058201058201

4624563,2,B0059XTUXQ,"""The Iron Lady"" is not the movie you expect it to be, nor is the movie you want it to be. That in it's self is not necessarily a bad thing, the reason that this is a bad movie is because what it is isn't very good. This is perhaps the least focused, least interesting biopic in a great many years. Considering it's fascinating subject, weather you agree politically or not, you've got to admit Marget Thatcher is an interesting woman and historical figure. What we get instead is a banal Lifetimeish movie of the week, a tear jerker, if you will, that no one cries over.

""The Iron Lady"" gives no insight into Mrs. Thatcher, little or no historical references, little in way of her personal life. Instead, the film seems focused on her weening years as she enters dementia and caries on conversations with her deceased husband. The unfocused script barely touched on issues of politics, how her gender affected her place in parliament or much of her personal sacrifices, that she must have made when ascending to the highest office in the land. This is the kind of vague biography where the subject is kept continuously at arms length. I have read that those who support this movie claim that it is well made, I disagree, it may look professionally made, but the film is undermined by flashbacks, edits and montages that keep the viewer disorientated.

Much has been said of Meryl Streep's performance as Mrs. Thatcher, well it is interesting and it is good, but not in the way most think it is. There is so little insight into Thatcher's personality and no emotional depth, that Streep is left to do little more than mimic her voice, her mannerisams, and thanks to a fine make-up specialist, her appearance. This isn't a performance so much, as an impersonation, a good one indeed, but an impersonation no less. Was Streep worth of the Best Actress Oscar? I don't really think so, an Academy Award should be seen as a standard of excellence, but in all facets of life mistakes are made, and the academy has made more than their fair share over the years.

""The Iron Lady"" was directed by Phyllida Lloyd, from a screenplay by Abi Morgan, who is a highly respected theatre director, her previous film was ""Mama Mia!"". I have read that miss Lloyd believes Thatcher to have been the most important woman in politics since Elizabeth 1. A valid point of view, not shared by all, but with such a strong belief in her subject, I have to ask, why did she so willingly let her down. A better focused, more interesting, and possibly better acted, movie will some day be made about Margret Thatcher. Until then, it's still best to get your history, even recent history for a good book.",1334620800,3,2674,4.60167714884696

It is silly, long and boring. I should have known it would have liberal anti-Thatcher slant when Meryl Streep got the academy award.

There isn't much to attack her with over cutting taxes and busting the labor unions. Unfortunately, however there are many ridiculous fabricated conversations between Margaret and the ghost of her late husband; too much.

The film portrays Mrs. Thatcher as a cold woman who was rude to allies in cabinet meetings and who sent soldiers to fight and die in the Falklands.

I bought it unseen because Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and I anticipated a great story about a great lady and one of the best Prime Ministers Britain has ever had. Instead what I got was an insult to the memory and history of this woman. The movie focuses far too much on her illness after she retired from government service, and very little on the substance and successes of her time in office. I'm sure Meryl Streep deserved her Oscar for her acting since she was very convincing as the Margaret Thatcher I remember in office, but she's not responsible for the content and the ridiculous way the movie kept jumping about from one time period to another. If you are buying this as a historical portrait of a fine leader, then give it a pass.

  Here we have a movie about one of the strongest women of modern times rising up through an all boys club and becoming the longest reigning PM of Britian and all it want to show is her declining years in a delerium!?!?!? What is going on? I would have loved to have known how her career came about, who helped what brought her to her convictions, her relationship with Reagan. I could go on but what's the point.

4624600,1,B0059XTUXQ,"UPDATE - April 8, 2013:  I just wanted to take a moment to remember the real Margaret Thatcher, who died today.  She was a great lady and I do hope that her strength, integrity and huge contributions to history will be remembered truthfully and fairly.

I so agree with what Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said regarding the senate resolution honoring Lady Thatcher, ""Let me just say that Margaret was one of the most influential and revolutionary figures of the 20th century, and failing to name her achievements would do her memory and her legacy a great disservice. It would be unheard of to commemorate Churchill for example and ignore his heroic role in steering his countrymen through the battle of Britain, nor would we think of honoring Lincoln without mentioning the Civil War,"" McConnell said. He added: ""Let's acknowledge the enormity of what she accomplished. Let's mention her achievements by name and the resolution does that because we owe her a tribute equal to her legacy.""

Truer words were never spoken, and this sentiment very aptly applies to the movie THE IRON LADY. May she Rest In Peace.  ~Linda~

ORIGINAL REVIEW - April 15, 2012:  I cannot understand what they were thinking!  An opportunity to make a movie about one of the MOST FASCINATING AND INFLUENTIAL WOMEN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.  The greatest actress of our generation playing the lead.  And this opportunity is squandered on a ditzy, artsy-fartsy script that examines the whole thing through the fictional fantasy lens of and elderly Margaret Thatcher's demented flashbacks - as if anyone actually knows what is really going on in the mind of a person with dementia.  What a waste.

It started out OK.  A lot of movies detailing the lives of great people start out in the first 10 minutes showing the main character in advanced old age and the main story is told in a long flashback.  This kind of plot device was done very well in the movie ""Chariots of Fire"".  I don't mind knowing that Margaret Thatcher is suffering from dementia - it is a fact and is not out of place in a story about her life.  But the problem with ""The Iron Lady"" is that the story got stuck in the advanced old age segment and about 45 minutes into the movie, I realized that the makers of this bomb had no intention of examining the MAIN STORY at all.  The WHOLE thing was about a lonely, demented old woman whose glory days have passed her by and now she is of no importance.  I found myself heaving an involuntary sigh of exasperation when I was subjected to yet another imaginary conversation held in the ""fictional"" Mrs. Thatcher's hallucination world.  What little factual and historically relevant information they included was hazy and spotty. The flow of the script is so disjointed that no sensible understanding of Margaret Thatcher's incredible life, accomplishments, family, or career can be gleaned from this self indulgent mess.  The people involved in making this boring, pointless movie should be ashamed.  I was expecting so much because it could have been great but was sorely disappointed.

A flick about an elderly woman suffering from dementia should have been saved for an arthouse fiction about dementia, not imposed on a life story of someone of this magnitude.  Really, what could have been the motive for obsuring Margaret Thatcher's enormous contributions to the twentieth century?  Could it be that the makers of this flick hated her and her politics and wanted to diminish and marginalize her but didn't have the courage to do it in an honest and up front fashion?  That is the only thing I can figure out because this movie makes absolutely no sense at all.  At best, it is a tawdry invasion of Mrs. Thatcher's and her family's privacy as she faces a slow and difficult death.  Perhaps it is a fact that she is struggling with dementia, but the writers of this script are not privy to the details of how that is being played out and have been forced to fictionalize it to an absurd degree in order to have a story that leaves out who she really is.  To magnify this small aspect of her life while brushing aside the bulk of her life's work is almost criminal.

There are only three good things that I have to say about this movie.  First, the make up artist did an exceptional job of making Meryl Streep look extremely elderly.  Most of the time, old age make up is sloppy and not believable, but I have to say that Ms. Streep really did look realisticly old in this movie.  The second thing is that Meryl Streep did a great job of acting, as usual.  It is a pity that she has no better judgement than to lend her great talent to a substandard production like this one.  I have always had some respect for Ms. Streep, but after watching this movie, I have lost some of my former good opinion of her. The third thing was that the movie finally ended and I never have to see it again.

I will never get back the time and money I wasted watching this stupid show, but I can spare just a few extra minutes to warn you that this is a waste of time for anyone who wishes to actually know anything about Margaret Thatcher and her real life.  Those facts are documented for anyone to see and no story teller needs to descend into outrageous liscence to make a movie with something worthwhile to say.  If you want to make a moive about dementia, then make a movie about dementia.  If you want to make a movie about Margaret Thatcher, then please, PLEASE make a true one.",1334448000,68,5465,4.601651186790506
4624601,2,B0059XTUXQ,"Where to start?  Maybe find the director and or writer and slap them and ask them what they were thinking!  They had a great story to tell with one of the all time best actresses and they ""over-thought"" it.  Her life was amazing enough without trying to be so complex about it.

One of the biggest challenges with doing a bio-pic like this is if you cover a life from beginning to end, 180 minutes is not enough.  They should have just focused in on a couple of significant events in her life that helped explain her and did the story.  But rather you are told the story from an 80 year old woman who is suffering from mental illness.  I have heard she is suffering from Alzheimer's but in the movie they make it look like the disease from A Beautiful Mind.

Not only is from her perspective, but then we get flashbacks.  Start at the end of her career, then flashback to the beginning.. Back to the end.. Then back to the 1970s'.  Then from the 70's back to the beginning, then back to the end.  Yep - flashbacks within flashbacks.

Here is how disappointing this film is.  It is called The Iron Lady because the Russians gave her that name because of her tough negotiating. Yet, the film NEVER shows her negotiating with the Russians.

Meryl Streep is nothing short of perfect; a performance where the actor/actress disappears and the character emerges - we need more performances of this caliber, regardless of the subject matter.

Many reviews are calling this work ""Masterful by Streep, but where is the film, the plot?"" I think the film is depicting truth; as difficult as some scenes are to watch one of the main tenets of a film is to tell the truth. This tenet has been caputured in MThatcher's idiosyncracies, philosophy, values, presence and aging process by Streep.

The title of the film is symbolic of her time in office and is appropriate.  It can also be attributed to her life and struggle before entering parliament and when leaving as it does take strength to go it alone in the face of obvious ailments. I loved Streep's dialogue, accent, mannerisms as MT. That alone was worth the ticket. Lets be reminded of the fact that now and again film does provide entertainment but primarily it is directed to reflect the truth, in history and persona.

This is a story, an unbiased story of a woman and her life, and the choices and her courage and her legacy. It is unbiased because it does not see her in a light of good or bad, right or wrong. It sees her as a human being in extraordinary circumstances.

this move might be slow for some, but i saw an amazing performance by Meryl Streep and a wondeful portrayal of a woman following her truth and convictions to make a mark in her world.

It is focused on her dementia to set the context- but it is the way to set her experience and i find no fault in that.

4624632,5,B0059XTUXQ,"As an Englishman who voted for her and lived through these very trying times, I thought it was a very interesting perspective.  Remember in Britain many people hated her with a passion so it would be hard to do a film on Thatcher that was just a ""celebration of what she did""  Many would not agree, although I would.

So I think this is a subtle way of getting the story told so both those who admired her and hated her could watch a drama about an Amazing woman in very interesting times.

I enjoyed the film and particularly remember the flash backs to what were very personal and engrained memories for me.  Merryl Streep does an excellent job and brings Thatcher to life.",1334275200,2,675,4.411290322580645
4624633,2,B0059XTUXQ,"This movie focused too much on the end of Ms. Thatcher's life instead of telling the story of the remarkable things that she did while she served as Prime Minister. Once again the Hollywood leftist elite told the story the way they wanted it to be remembered. I was expecting the story of an exceptional woman who accomplished amazing things during a tumultuous time. Instead, the story focused on what Ms. Thatcher MAY be like now-- elderly, delusional, and confused. I kept waiting for the movie to go into the main story, and it never did. I'm so glad we didn't buy this movie on DVD as it would have been a tremendous waste of money and storage space.

In the long term, people will remember Margaret Thatcher as the great person that she was, long after they will have forgotten everything about the people who made this disappointing movie.",1334275200,4,846,4.64
4624634,4,B0059XTUXQ,"I lived through Thatherism and was transported back to those times as I watched the film. I well remember Mrs. Thatcher's inner strength and backbone. She was the only politician in the Conservative Party that could have carried it at that time. Whatever one thought of her politics, she was the right person for the job. This was the upwardly mobile yuppy generation. She built these concepts. Everyone was out for themselves, and didn't care about anyone else.

Now I come to the acting. Meryl Streep is nothing short of brilliant in this role.  To all the so called actresses out there that are more concerned with being celebrities, this is what true acting is about. Ms. Streep makes us forget that she is Meryl Streep. We only see Mrs. Thatcher on the screen. She completely becomes Mrs. Thatcher in everything, including the very convincing British accent (and I am British).

Now to the weaknesses of the film. I understand that Mrs. Thatcher is now suffering from dementia. I felt that the film played the dementia angle far too much.  I would have been comfortable with one or two references to Dennis showing up in her bedroom or living room, but he was constantly there, and that became tedious after a while. Regardless of one's politics, a film like this should be about the things that she achieved and did, and not focus so much on her current illness. I understand what the director was trying to do. It is difficult to do well in a short time and that produces areas of weakness in an otherwise wonderful film.

Well done Mrs. Streep. I look forward to your next film.",1334275200,2,1586,4.65
4624655,4,B0059XTUXQ,"The Iron Lady, largely revolving around Margaret Thatcher's later years tottering around her flat (with bits here and there about her time as the most powerful woman in Europe) is a frustrating experience. This is not because the film is overall bad per se, but because the good parts (which shined) are so intermittent. There's no structure, no through-line, just an older MT hallucinating, stumbling around, listening to old records, then quick cuts to too-short sequences of her growing up, having a family, waltzing her way to positions of enormous power, bullying around her cabinet and foreign heads of state, and dealing with the risks of her economic policies. With a bit less present and a ton more past, the movie would be a formidable work of art, for these sequences are nuanced (if underwritten), and, if gone into in more detail, could have been fascnating explorations of how Thatcher the person reconciled being Thatcher the leader.

Meryl Streep, however, is flawless, easily giving the year's best performance and fully deserving of her Oscar. She goes from wide-eyed optimist to strong-jawed leader to querolous octegenarian with consistent skill. About an hour and a half in the movie she gives her cabinet a power-drunk string of rebukes before realizing the consequences of her outbursts, and the sequence is a master class of emotion and subtlety. She is also wholly believable in the film's older scenes, and does not rely on the (excellent) makeup to transmit MT's loneliness and fading grasp on reality. I really cannot praise her enough.

But too much potential is squandered here. Her achievements, and the enormity of her successes, aren't explored. The scene's during Thatcher's rule are too myopic to develop greater themes about how she feels about the changes in her power, and are instead only about how she felt at that moment. By the film's end, the only new thing you learn about her is that her husband was kind of goofy. However, I would have to recommend it, if only for Streep's superlative work.",1334275200,,2037,4.988235294117647

4624657,3,B0059XTUXQ,"That Meryl Streep would be brilliant in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is a given and should be enough to justify a film's existence, but this sympathetic 2011 historical biopic does not give the actress enough to work with in what amounts to a charitable and cursory view of a controversial figure. Director Phyllida Lloyd had directed Streep in one of her lighter recent efforts, 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia!</a>, where caricature and fleet footing worked together to keep the bouncy ABBA-penned score from touching ground. This time, however, a more definitive grounding would have been beneficial to provide Thatcher's story with much-needed perspective. Unfortunately, screenwriter Abi Morgan's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shame/dp/B007FXLZ9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shame</a>) episodic patchwork of a script takes no sides in presenting the life and career of one of the most influential world leaders of the 20th century. Instead, amid moments of genuine poignancy, her story is tethered to the ravages of old age and the onset of dementia, presenting the still-living Thatcher as an almost Dickensian character dependent on the ghost of her eccentric late husband Denis for personal support.

In fact, the film opens circa 2008 with Thatcher in a semi-senile state venturing out to buy milk at a local convenience store. Even though she is immersed in imaginary conversations with Denis, she is preparing to dispose of his clothes eight years after his death at the behest of her daughter Carol. After this lengthy introductory sequence, the story starts to traverse back and forth between extended flashbacks and her present-day solitude. We see her as the devoted daughter of a Grantham grocer, worshipful of her father but distant from her mother as Thatcher takes an interest in national politics starting at the lowest rungs of the Conservative party. From these early-day scenes, it's difficult to tell how or why she climbed to the top of the party because there is barely a glimmer of the ruthless ambition and savvy positioning that must have been Thatcher's forte to get ahead. Instead, we get the Cliff's Notes version that cuts to the high points of her career, so significant turning points come across as little more than a dramatic checklist.

Running a blessedly brief 105 minutes, the film tackles in quick succession her Conservative stand at Parliament, her pointed challenge to Edward Heath for leadership of the party, her unfettered decision to send troops to defend the Falkland Islands, and her forced resignation in the face of hubris and waning popularity. Interspersed throughout is archival footage of the real Thatcher (with her face hidden, of course) during her twelve years as Prime Minister, the longest of any in the last century. Had Lloyd and Morgan reined in the breadth of Thatcher's life and zeroed in on a defining moment like the Falkland Islands war, the film would have been more dramatically effective in revealing the true figure. There is, however, no faulting Streep (with seamless assistance from her long-time make-up assistant J. Roy Helland) whose uncanny resemblance and authoritative performance commands attention most willingly. The surrounding cast barely has time to make any vivid impressions with the exceptions of Jim Broadbent's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iris/dp/B000067J3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iris</a>) sprightly, familiar turn as Denis and Alexandra Roach's wide-eyed impersonation of the younger Margaret. Otherwise, the pacing feels off due to Justine Wright's choppy editing and Elliot Davis' overly artful camera angles. See it purely for Streep's artistry.",1334188800,,3849,5.822695035460993
4624658,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Movie biographies at the very best are highlights of a life. A film can't capture every nuance of a life, every pivotal moment that shapes a person, so we're left with the high and lows, a highlights reel of a life and ""The Iron Lady"" tries to capture pivotal moments in Margaret Thatcher's rise from grocers daughter to British Prime Minister.

Told from the point of view of Thatcher (Meryl Streep) in her dotage carrying on conversations with her now deceased husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent), as she remembers an abbreviated youth, meeting Thatcher at a dinner where she is being vetted to run for a local office, and her quick rise during the 60's and 70's from a member of Parliament to Prime Minister. After she becomes Prime Minister the film really does seem to become a highlights clip of her political career, it does linger on the Falkland Islands war and her analogy to it being a British Pearl Harbor, but after that her tenure as Prime Minister seems to be on fast forward.

Streep as Thatcher is almost invisible, some of it is the make-up to make her look in her 80's, but most of it is Streep's performance, as with any of the characters she's created from Sophie to Julia Child, Meryl Streep has the uncanny ability to channel and have the character inhabit her, and while some of those characters may resemble Streep, her characterization carries us away from recognition of the star and to recognition of the character.

At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after a short while I realized they were doing re-runs of her life through a woman aging with dementia.  My mother suffered from Alzheimer's and I didn't want to watch it all over again.  It's a horror.  I will not watch the rest of this film.

I've recently purchased two DVD's with her in it,Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, I loved them both. Watched them many times.  She's great in both. The films are uplifting and enjoyable.  We all have enough of our own problems to watch something as awful as this. I hated Doubt as well, but at least I could watch it.  I guess I'm not interested in horror films.  That was what this film seemed to be moving into. Well, that's all I have to write.  I will probably never watch the rest, but I don't think I'll be missing anything.

Not a well-done film for any reason.
After thinking about it, I side with those who are angry that the movie slights the living M.Thatcher by the emphasis on her mental issues in later life while she still lives.

We see young Margaret in her first political campaign, as she meets her beloved husband (later played by Jim Broadbent), and her eleven years as Prime Minister with its struggles and triumphs; but mostly, we see her deteriorating health and increasing frailty.

I was absolutely stunned by Streep's impersonation of Thatcher; aided by incredibly believable make-up, she looks and sounds just like her and gives a thrilling performance.  It is an example of the finest acting and I'm glad she was rewarded with an Oscar, but I wish the role had been played by a British actress instead.  Jim Broadbent, as Denis Thatcher, plays his usual, jovial character and, while very likable, reminded me of silly Horace Slughorn from `Harry Potter.'

The script was underwhelming in scenes depicting Thatcher's public life, but it was excellent in the very moving scenes of her current life as a delicate, rather pathetic, old lady.  All in all, I enjoyed it but think it could have been better.",1334102400,,1120,4.994623655913978
4624666,4,B0059XTUXQ,"That THE IRON LADY ultimately fails as a great movie is puzzling.  Despite the great performance by Meryl Streep portraying the larger than life Margaret Thatcher, one of the most important political players of the 20th century, the story remains spotty and unsatisfying despite evidence that it is trying so very hard. Abi Morgan is responsible for the screenplay that does indeed offer individual scenes with touch moments but lets the overall sweep of the film in tatters.  Phyllida Law directs.

For reference, `Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, PC, FRS, ne Roberts (born 13 October 1925) is a British politician and the longest-serving (1979-1990) British prime minister of the 20th century, and the only woman ever to have held the post. A Soviet journalist nicknamed her the ""Iron Lady"", which later became associated with her uncompromising policies. As prime minister, she implemented conservative policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.'  Where the film take us is to view Thatcher (Meryl Streep) as elderly and a virtual prisoner in her own home due to her concerned staff and daughter Carol (Olivia Colman). She looks back on her life as she clears out her late husband Denis's (Jim Broadbent) clothes for the Oxfam shop. Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premeireship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margaret's life forever.

Streep's ability to convey the mental deterioration of this lady is a triumph of moderation: she never imitates Alzheimer's disease but instead allows us to view senility in a new way. The cast is large and there are some good performances by some of England's finest actors.  But somehow the events during Thatcher's rise to the role as England's first woman Prime Minister and all the events (Falkland war, fall of the Berlin wall, etc) just seem like addenda.  Even the usual fine music composer Thomas Newman fails in his task to create a memorable score (except for the inclusion of Maria Callas singing `Casta diva' from Bellini's `Norma' and excerpts of Bach from the Well Tempered Clavier). It is a showcase for Meryl Streep and she handles her end of the project well indeed.  Grady Harp, April 12",1334102400,,2462,5.002444987775061

The movie portrays her as an addled old lady who hallucinates that she's talking to her dead husband and remembering her time as Prime Minister by flashbacks. (Now it is a real-life fact that her daughter Carol says that Maggie is going through dementia and has to be constantly reminded that her husband died almost 10 years ago) but they could've focused more on her time as Prime Minister in the prime of her life and her brilliant speeches, etc and what she was and not how she's declined in recent years. This movie is ultimately a disservice to Margaret Thatcher as a person. While it hits the highlights of her time as Prime Minister, they shouldn't have portrayed her as a confused old lady.

In The Iron Lady, Meryl Streep plays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the same chameleonic grace she harnessed for her portrayal of Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia. Told primarily in flashback, Phyllida Lloyd's portrait begins in Thatcher's youth, then traces her rise to power and chronicles her involvement in certain key historical events. To get a sense of my opinion of the film, consider the following: Lloyd's only other feature directorial effort, 2008's ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia, is actually better The Iron Lady, but for her work on the latter, Streep took home Best Actress honors from the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Academy Awards.

Every now and then you'd recognize Streep, but for the most part you really believe she's Thatcher.  Just a superlative job by probably the greatest actress alive.

Beyond that the story is totally made up.  It isn't based on any book, or biography or autobiography.  It's just the imaginings of the writer, imagining what Mrs. Thatcher is doing all day at her house in Mayfair.  It's a really quite mean and negative view of her.  And this isn't a left wing/right wing thing.  The book ""Game Change"" did a number on Hillary Clinton, and not just Sarah Palin.

4624674,3,B0059XTUXQ,"There is no doubt that Meryl Streep embodied the spirit and facade of Margaret Thatcher. It is one of those remarkable performances that you are unlikely to forget. The real Margaret Thatcher, however, was left somewhere else. I got the point that she was a strong woman, opinionated and had a rough road to hoe to her position as Prime Minister, but the rest was left elsewhere.

Streep's performance and that of David Broadbent, who plays her husband, Dennis, were the highlights of the film. The story is told in flashbacks and as we are told in terms of a demented, Margaret Thatcher. Not the best way to portray a woman of such substance. It is intimated that her son, Mark, was not and has not been a big part of her life. It was also intimated that Margaret Thatcher was not a big part of her children's lives. Not much was explained, it is all a perception. Much of what Margaret Thatcher went through as part of the House of Commons was also our perception. It looked like she had a great deal to overcome with her male colleagues, and the fact that she was the first Prime Minister is remarkable. That road in her life, needed much more emphasis.

Meryl Streep gave such a superb performance, this was the film. She deserved the Academy Award for this performance.
That, however, is the film, and I expected so much more.

""Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think we become."" A look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, the first and only female Prime Minister of England. This movie covers from her acceptance to Oxford up to present day. Being a huge history buff I was looking forward to this movie. Growing up in the 80's I remember quite a bit about Thatcher and was hoping to see stuff that I knew already and events to help me fill in the gaps of things I didn't. While this is a good movie overall I was very disappointed. The movie pretty much deals with how she handles her husbands death with bits of flashbacks thrown in. It does cover a fair amount of her time as leader but really only covers how she decided to run, trying to get back the Faulking Islands and her resignation. I was surprised there wasn't more Cold War events as well as her dealings with Reagan. I will admit that Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie and did deserve the Oscar, but I am glad the movie wasn't up for best picture. Even for a history buff like me this was a little boring.

If you are not interested in Margaret Thatcher (one way or the other), don't worry, 85% of this movie is has nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher and could have been about any old woman.

So, what about the remaining 15 minutes ?

Well, Meryl Streep's performance of Margaret Thatcher (in the 15 minutes that actually deal with her life before dementia) is also fantastic. I mean, wow! Just like Val Kilmer's face is the one I now see when I think of Jim Morrisson, or Forest Whitaker when I think of Idi Amin Dada, Meryl Streep has managed to look more real than the real thing.

Unfortunately, having set aside only 15 minutes to develop her life from the 1930's until her ouster from power in 1990, the script is totally disjointed and anecdotic (60 seconds on the Falklands war).

In summary, if you like Meryl Streep this movie is for you. But if you love, or hate, or are simply curious about, Margaret Thatcher, then avoid this movie like the plague; you will be immensely frustrated.",1333411200,32,1173,4.598086124401914
4624708,4,B0059XTUXQ,"""The Iron Lady""  is the story of the political rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) from her modest early years as a clerk in her parents' grocery shop to prime minister of Great Britain.  As with many screen biographies, the movie touches on career high points and, in the interest of maintaining a reasonable running time, either encapsulates or sidesteps the rest.

The story unfolds from the present day as Thatcher recalls episodes from her past, with Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, and her often tempestuous tenure as prime minister, the film's most interesting.  We see Thatcher's rise to prominence in Parliament even as she is ridiculed as both a woman and a newcomer who dares to challenge seasoned members of that body.  She seeks the advice of image shapers who suggest ways to command the respect of her peers and their serious attention.  These include a new hairdo, a deeper speaking voice, and the abandonment of hats.

Traditional make-up, hair styling, prosthetics, and contact lenses contribute to an often uncanny likeness between star and real-life stateswoman.

Streep's performance is extraordinary and won her her third Oscar.  However, the film itself is kind of old-fashioned in its depiction of Thatcher as stalwart world leader.  We see her triumphs and her modest beginnings, yet there is a sense that we've never really gotten insight into the woman.

Blu-ray extras include a making-of documentary and featurettes on Thatcher's husband, Denis; the film's costume design; Thatcher's battle in the House of Commons; and transforming Streep into Margaret Thatcher.  The movie is also available on DVD.",1333238400,,1650,5.184905660377359
4624709,4,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her remarkable performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY, as did make-up artists Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland for their work on the production.  Indeed, when she is playing the elderly Thatcher, if you didn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen, you wouldn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen.

Sadly, Streep's performance is really the only reason the see this 2011release, because the movie itself is rather dull.

The problem lies in its approach to the material.  The story is told in flashbacks, which can often work, but in this instance director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have chosen to spend far more screen time with the aged, delusional Thatcher ,  having conversations with her late husband (Jim Broadbent), rather than focusing on her political career, which would have been far more interesting.

Broadbent and all of the other actors, particularly Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd, playing the younger versions of Streep and Broadbent, are exceptional, but a film that prefers to concentrate on the framing story undercuts them all.

I would have liked to have learned a lot more about Margaret Thatcher than I did from this picture.

THE IRON LADY has been released in a 3-disc Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.  Extras include many ""Making of"" featurettes that are enhanced with interviews with the actors and filmmakers.

4624710,3,B0059XTUXQ,"Read all the reviews of this film (there are 127 here already on Amazon - focusing on the film as shown in theaters. ALL of them focus on Meryl Streep and here Oscar-winning performance. I have to agree that she is an amazing actress and really inhabits the character of Margaret Thatcher in this film. But the production as a whole seems to last for three hours when, in fact, it is only 105 minutes. The reason is the concept used by Director Phyllidia Lloyd that has the time frame jumping back and forth (AND back and forth, and...) between Thatcher in her final days and at various points in her career. There is the conceit that has her late husband (and childhood sweetheart) Denis, appearing in her mind (and on screen) to converse with her, long after he has died. Personally I was getting a headache with all this time shifting. So, as a film, this only gets three stars from me.

The Blu-Ray DVD - and I think the standard DVD - has a large group of special features, though many are short and one is really odd. They consist of:

Making the Iron Lady - 12 minutes - the standard ""making of"" featurette with the cast and crew making comments among scenes repeated from the film.

Recreating the young Margaret Thatcher - 3 minutes

Denis, The Man Behind the woman - 2  minutes - focusing on Jim Broadbent's character

Battle in the House of Commons -2  minutes - mostly comments by the Director (and some repeats section from the ""Making of"" one

Costume Design: Pearls and Power Suits - 2  minutes - comments from the costume designer and Director

And the odd one: an 18-minute ""featurette"" on Historical film bios, that - while interesting - is a promo piece for other recent DVDs of Weinstein Company produced films. We learn about Marilyn Monroe (from film historian Drew Casper and actress Michelle Williams), Wallis Simpson (the film W.E. where we hear from a professor and the film's director Madonna) , The Iron Lady (with comments by the book version's author John Campbell and Streep) and one more film I forget. It seems to have been edited from a longer piece because there is a narrator but no title or credit.

So, if you want to see a great actress inhabit a role, this is the film. But if you want to learn a lot about British history during Thatcher's career, I'm afraid this is not the best place to find that.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4624711,5,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep won a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to this day one of the most powerful women who has ever graced the earth.

 ""The Iron Lady"" begins with an aged Thatcher walking the streets of London, well into her eighties, buying fruits and vegetables, with no one recognizing who she is. The film is told in flashback as we learn of Margaret's upbringing, her interst in political life and her ultimate postion as Britain's first female head-of-state.

 Meryl Streep's performance here is nothing short of astonishing: her speech, facial expressions (helped by inventive make-up) and her mannerisms are dead-on. Streep had never met the real Thatcher, but was able to view old film's from archives from the BBC and other sources and it was from watching Thatcher that Streep discovered how to play her.

 It took Meryl 29 years to win another Oscar thanks to this role. As a huge fan of hers I have to say ""The Iron Lady"" is my favorite of all the performances Streep has done.

 Simply an A+ film.",1332806400,6,1069,4.80327868852459

Unfortunately, the characters were not properly developed in the movie. Many appeared very superficial.

However, the acting was excellent, Meryl Streep performance was extremely good. As were most of the other actors.

What I thought was brilliant was the makeup, they used on Maryl Streep. The way they could  make her look older and younger. I was very impressed with that.",1332720000,2,604,4.9405940594059405
4624733,3,B0059XTUXQ,"""The Iron Lady"" got two Oscars nominations (Best Achievement in Makeup and Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role) and won both, but received no other nominations. Perhaps this fact tells you something about this biographical movie about Margaret Thatcher here played by Meryl Streep. Not surprisingly, Meryl Streep shows what a seasoned performer like her can do, and you will not be disappointed with her acting. As to the film itself, however, maybe you should read a book instead.

My complaint is a simple one. This is a life story of a political icon Margaret Thatcher, and that means it is full of events, so why not tell the story in a straightforward and linear way?

Instead of that, ""The Iron Lady"" insists on showing Margaret Thatcher in her later years, seeing hallucinatory visions of her deceased husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). The film goes back and forth in time between today when aged Margaret Thatcher is seen talking with Denis, and several important episodes in her political career like the Falklands War.

I don't know who is responsible for the unnecessarily complicated narrative structure, writer Abi Morgan (""Shame"") or director Phyllida Lloyd (""Mamma Mia!""). Despite the solid performances from the supports including Richard E. Grant and Anthony Head, ""The Iron Lady"" does not tell us much about Margaret Thatcher, whether as a prime minister or a person.",1332028800,7,1395,5.056521739130435
4624734,3,B0059XTUXQ,"When I think about this movie I am filled with a sense of inner conflict.

On the one hand I am highly impressed with Meryl Streep's performance, for which she has at long last and deservedly won her third Academy Award after a 30 year gap, and after being nominated for the Academy Award a record seventeen times.

Once every two years she is nominated for an Academy Award. Only Katharine Hepburn has more with four.

Other directors have made movies about our leading political figures. Often these movies are not flattering portraits. Oliver Stone made a satirical comedy about G W Bush, which I found highly entertaining, somewhat of a caricature. Michael Moore made a far more scathing movie Fahrenheit 911. Then we have Primary Colors where where John Travolta played a played a Presidential candidate much like president Clinton. Stone also directed Nixon, a somewhat sympathetic picture of a character many regarded as villainous. Even though these portratits were not flattering you could detect some love or least amusement for the subject.

Now with Iron Lady, we have a movie which defines its subject through the lens of disease, presumably Alzheimer's, although it never states the exact disease. The movie starts out promisingly enough with Thatcher, the grocers daughter, buying a bottle of milk, unrecognised and confused at a local grocery store.

Streep conveys every nuance of Thatcher extremely well. The actor truly becomes the character, capturing, the tone, the accent, the gestures, the body language impeccably.

What happens though, as you continue to watch, too much of the story is frittered away on depicting Thatcher as she is now, her disease, imaginary conversations with her long dead husband, living in the past, with occasional flashbacks, to the significant events of her political life, the romance with Denis, her rise to power, the various crises while she was in office, terrorist attacks, the Falklands War, the H Block protest, which escalated the tensions in Northern Irealnd, and so forth, and ultimately her fall from grace.

I found this focus on defining the character by her disease extremely annoying and tiresome, and a huge mistake by the screenwriters to spend almost 50% of the time focusing on the disease while while forwarding through the significant events. The Falklands war is compressed to about five minutes. The H Block protests last about thirty seconds.

I lived in the UK for the latter part of her leadership. Her insistence on an unpopular tax was the beginning of her downfall, and the cause of her being deposed as leader through the usual shenanigans. Here again we have very short treatment of what could have been great drama in favor of promoting the disease.

When this movie was released several months ago in Argentina, it reportedly escalated tensions in Argentina. A journalist in the Falklands made an unflattering comment about the current female president. There were threats of invasion, and death threats against the journalist. It appears that she knows how to work the situation. Thankfully, this movie did not start a war.

Iron Lady could have been a much better movie with a shift in focus away from the disease.

Recently, I listened to an interview Streep did on the (NPR Fresh Air program), shortly before the Oscars. It was fascinating to learn how she puts together a character, and how she captured all those aspects of Thatcher's voice and rhetoric, the vocal coaching Thatcher underwent to moderate the strident early vocal style. How Thatcher had enormous lung power. People would wait for a break in breath to interrupt, but she would just keep going, much to their frustration. It discussed Streep's entire career. It was extremely well researched. Catch it if you can.

I think most people will appreciate Streep's performance, but probably will not like the movie overall. I will not watch this movie again. I hope that future screenwriters and directors will have more sympathy and sensitivity for their subject than this.

If not for Streep's performance this would be a one star review. Her longtime hairstylist also won an Oscar for this movie.

Hope this was helpful.",1331856000,21,4175,5.0406386066763424

If ever an Academy Award was given to the right person, this was the time - Streep absolutely clones her mannerisms, speech inflections and style in a way I've never seen anyone else come close. But besides the outstanding performance, the script is somewhat lackluster, deciding to take the career of one of the most iconic people of the century and focus on the least interesting parts.

It's not that the script itself is terrible - it's better than many films I've seen in the last 12 months. It's more that it feels like a missed opportunity since there are dozens of events that could have been drawn upon to make a more interesting film. In making a movie that's essentially about isolation and loneliness, it fails to capture the sheer passion and depth of feeling - both positive and negative - that the average Briton had for Mrs Thatcher.

Overall, I'd still recommend the film to people who are interested in the former Prime Minister but be prepared for watching something that's very small scale given the grandness of the times when she was in power.",1331769600,4,1231,4.80188679245283

What we get is essentially two stories linked by a single unique and brilliant actress. Meryl Streep's acting skills are not in dispute but they are wasted in this quite dreadful film. Love or hate her, Margaret Thatcher was one powerful Lady and her life will always be controversial. Rather than concentrating on these issues, some two thirds of this film is about a frail old lady, who looks like Margaret Thatcher, experiencing the problems of advancing senility. To depict anyone in such a light is potentially deeply offensive and distressing to the individual as well as her family and her many friends and admirers. It has no bearing on her political life which was during a time when she was in her prime. This part of the film is quite despicable in my view and uncalled for at this stage of her life. Her husband gets little better treatment being shown mostly as a fool.

The second part dealing with some selected scenes from her political life is very much better and shows what might have been achieved with a decent script and a competent director. What disappoints me the most is that Meryl Streep took on such a role. I doubt her intention was to humiliate Thatcher but whatever it was the final result is a lost opportunity as she will never now make the film that she should and could have made. This is really a terrible film and should only be viewed to admire Meryl Streep's consumate acting, it has little or nothing to do with the Iron lady.",1329782400,9,1608,4.544827586206897

I really enjoyed the angle this story was told from, the old lady getting flashbacks of her eventful life - in a stage in life where her mind is not as sharp and well functioning as it used to be - giving it a touch of reality, showing that this is a film about the life of a real person and not an icon.

I learned about where she came from and the reasons for her politics, what formed her and what she brought with her from her upbringing making her to the person she became. What it took from her to enter the men's world, how much better she had to be than her fellow male party members, how strong her beliefs were and that all these qualities became her nemesis in the end.

And the man who believed the most in her and always supportive - her husband - brilliantly performed by Jim Broadbent. I particularly loved the loving look on his face when he was looking at his wife. His character is in my opinion really adding an important perspective to the film.

Meryl Streep is wonderful - how she is able to transform into the character is amazing - this is acting of first class.

For example, the epic economic upsurge in the British economy caused by her re-privatization and conservative economic policies is only shown with quickly flashed headlines in a sequence in which protesters attack Thatcher's car.

Watching the film is like watching a biography of Winston Churchill focused solely on his alcoholism or JFK focused exclusively on his supposed philandering.

The whole thing feels like someone said, ""let's celebrate her as a woman who overcame sexism and became a leader, but let's minimize her pro-business economic policies at all costs."" The producers seem to want a symbol for their beliefs as opposed to presenting her actual beliefs.

Astounding liberties are taken with the ordering of the historical record, and despite some fine moments (the first meeting with the public image consultant stands out, and the final scene) the script's dialogue consistently fails to rise to the challenge of convincingly conveying the ideological texture and trajectory of the times. I don't think any 16 year-old could watch this and leave the cinema feeling truly enlightened about the achievements brought about in the 1980s by Mrs Thatcher's ideas and personality, other than a vague memory that Thatcher was a strong woman. Because of this key failure in the script, the movie has to fall back on confusing jumbles of over-strident music and aggressive TV news footage to try to convey the mood. It simply fails in this, often painfully so. Having recently re-read Mrs Thatcher's two autobiographies, I felt the film failed very badly in conveying her core philosophy. The scene where she challenges Al Haig is a good example in this - it comes across as very weak tea, if you've heard the powerful and convincing way it's dealt with in _The Falklands Play_. At other times the film becomes, frankly, a little boring. It's perhaps visually that the film is most excellent, with very strong costuming and hair, set off with excellent lighting. But that's just not enough to make a great film. Despite all the polish and the fine performance from Streep, and workmanlike performance from Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, _The Iron Lady_ really can't compare to other depictions. I'm thinking here of the excellence of the radio version of _The Falklands Play_ (in terms of the power of the dialogue to fuse ideas and drama), or _The Long Walk to Finchley_ (in terms of conveying the complex combination of human personality and political ideals). I really wanted to like _The Iron Lady_, but it won't be on my list of movies to watch again.",1328313600,10,2071,4.836619718309859
4624793,1,B0059XTUXQ,"First, the good point of the movie - Streep's acting.  Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and she gives, as you would expect, a great performance.

Now the bad points of the movie - everything else.  This movie was not at all what I was expecting.  If you're going into the theater looking for a movie on the history, life and career of Margaret Thatcher, you are going to be as bitterly disappointed as I was.

The movie focuses on an elderly Thatcher, retired in her home and apparently losing her mind, as she spends a good deal of the movie conversing with the hallucination of her dead husband.  We get disjointed spurts of Thatcher's history thru a series of short flashbacks.  But these flashbacks offer no real insight into her career, certainly not any kind of cohesive history.  The flashbacks seem to be there only to highlight the regrets of an elderly Thatcher, tottering around her apartment alone, relegated to the sidelines by both family and friends alike.

The movie is tedious and slow and before it was halfway over, I was bored.  I was also a little mad.
Margaret Thatcher was the preeminent female figure for the better part of the 20th century: a political powerhouse.  She was the first modern woman to rise to a position of real power and influence.  Her career opened up a path for other women in politics and her decisions helped shaped the course of Europe.  The title of the movie is The Iron Lady and Thatcher, with all her good points and all her flaws, was powerful and strong and determined.  So it puzzled me why the movie seemed determined to turn her into a parody of female flaws and weaknesses.  She is portrayed as a selfish mother who chose career over family;  a distant wife, who takes her husband for granted until after he is dead; and a catty, overbearing woman who nags and bullies her constituents.

It is a completely skewed portrayal of Thatcher - unflattering and I suspect for the most part, untrue.  This movie does not even come close to doing justice to the story of Margaret Thatcher.  It actually has a very anti-Thatcher, anti-woman vibe to it.  The writers have presented us with a morality play with a clear ""lesson"" woven in:  ""See!"", the movie seems to be saying, ""This is what happens to upstart women who abandon their families and their rightful place in pursuit of their career.  They end up old and alone and regretful.  Beware! Beware!""",1328227200,35,2404,4.631205673758865
4624794,5,B0059XTUXQ,"I saw this movie in the theater and all I got to say is WOW.  I was in tune from the start all the way to the end.  My emotions were high from the very beginning.  The acting in this movie was WOW. Merl Steep did amazing job.  Weather you agree with her politics or not, it is a movie to go see and be amazed by this woman.  After the watching the movie I had to learn more about her and she is one my heroes.  WOW",1328227200,4,414,3.647727272727273
4624795,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Yes. We get it. Meryl Streep is fantastic, and everyone knows that, and we could go on for ages about it and present her with yet another oscar nomination, predictably, but you know what? As Madam Thatcher says in a pivotal scene in this movie, one's life must matter! So I will give it to you straight. Meryl could also be starring in a lifetime movie of the week and it would have equal artistic merit as this mess.

As we all know, hollywood likes to consider themselves quite self congratulatory. They awarded an oscar to charlize theron because she went from so chic and lovely to well...we all know!  They awarded milk and crash because golly gee, social causes are important! This time around, the oscar reasoning behind support for the iron lady will be how hollywood thinks its actually cutting edge/hip to show conservatives as people with feelings.

We see Thatcher in her old age, going mad in her well lit apartment. Why not make it tragic? Instead of even a polanski-lite director at the helm, we have a unambitious style that fails to ever catch fire and instill passion the viewer, and a style that stifles even meryls performance.

Yes, she was the first woman prime minister but the movie of course fails to address her battles with sexism in a remotely compelling way. We are shown that her rise to power was due not to her intellect, but due to her audacity. Unlike say Milk or Bullworth, we see no hints of the wheeling and dealing apparent in any politicians ascent to power.  And it is beaten over our head in this movie that, despite her war mongering, union-busting ways, she was good intentioned toward the everyman! After all, she was a mother! I don't buy it.

But the true reason this movie will fade will be not due to the fact that it thinks its breaking new ground for pulling an ayn rand and showing conservative principles as daring and courageous, no. It will be due to the fact that it has no ambition for itself, which is ironic considering the subject matter. It is literally about nothing. Whatever you say about this woman it's clear that she was quite a lady and she deserves an honest account of her life, at the very least. This is just bland whitewash.",1328054400,10,2196,4.546835443037975
4624796,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Why on earth cast Streep when the great Judi Dench would have been perfect?  Or Helen Mirren?  While British actors do a wonderful job on pretty much any subject they tackle, American actors and filmmakers nearly always do horrible work on any foreign project.  Were I British I'd be madder than a mashed cat over this portrayal of Thatcher, whether I liked her or not.

Just a note to say I remember the Thatcher years not just for the reasons mentioned in other reviews, but because they also dovetail with the Ronald Reagan years.

Apparently folks here in the States prefer not to remember some of the facts about Reagan, while creating this mythological delirious idolatry of a man who was at best a ""B"" actor who could not add. He could, however, look the part of the all-American archtypical hero of the day, deliver a great speech, and did have a gorgeous speaking voice. He also had a bitch on wheels for a wife who spent money like a drunken sailor on shore leave for designer clothes, real jewelry along with other luxuries, all for the good of the taxpayers I'm sure.

What most Reagan devotees really like to avoid discussing is his very close relationship with Lew Wasserman, the last Hollywood mogul. Lew Wasserman (allegedly) started out as a Chicago mobster, was successful enough to move onto New York, and then became enthralled with the movie business. He acquired MCA (Music Corp. of America,) hooked up with Jules Stein and headed for Hollywood, CA. MCA was the most powerful talent agency of it's time mostly in music, but it did manage two actors - Hattie McDaniel, Oscar winning actress of Gone With the Wind, and Ronald Reagan. Wasserman went on to become a legend creating Universal City and so forth. He also created Ronald Reagan. Clearly not going anywhere as an actor, Wasserman cleverly ""promoted"" him as President of the Screen Actors Guild (the union for actors,) then Governor of California for 8 years (what a mess - put my home state straight away into bankruptcy,) then President of the U.S. for 8 years (same story only worse.)

Ronald Reagan was (allegedly) a charming empty suit who received many sweetheart deals from the very powerful film industry, and gave back in return from the very powerful positions he attained.

The Thatcher/Reagan match was obviously one made in heaven for both. Reagan turned the Republican Party into a mecca for religious fanatics, bigots, and racists, throwing separation of church and state out the window; deregulated lending institutions; and pretended to overthrow communist Russia, among so many, many other things noteworthy for their disasterous effects like chucking the gold standard out the window and bankrupting the U.S. too.

I would not watch anything about Thatcher or Reagan. Living through the years they presided was more than enough. Who wants to relive that?

And I am sick to death of Streep and her imitations and stupid accents. It is embarrassing to have an actress with that much money always appear on award shows looking like a homeless frump. She works with the greatest costumers in the world. Get one, or take a hard look in a mirror and get help.",1327968000,9,3151,4.829313543599258
4624797,5,B0059XTUXQ,This movie is marvelous and Meryl  Streep is  in top form.. If you haven't seen it yet go see it she gave one of the most touching and gripping performances of the year! A+,1327881600,5,172,4.029411764705882
4624798,3,B0059XTUXQ,"It's only because of the superb performances of Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent as Margaret and Denis Thatcher that I give ""The Iron Lady"" three stars out of five. Without them, it would deserve two at the most. Streep as usual is impeccable; her appearance, voice and mannerisms are so perfect that for long stretches of the movie you forget you're not watching the real Margaret Thatcher. Broadbent as Denis is playful and charmingly dotty; together, he and Streep make the most delightful British Odd Couple since Horace ahd Hilda Rumpole.

Unfortunately, Abi Morgan's screenplay is misshapen and wrongheaded, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction lackadaisical. Under their guidance, ""The Iron Lady"" becomes mostly the story of the elderly, demented Margaret, living in a fantasy world with the image of her long-dead husband. The story of Margaret's political rise and triumph, in which she once again made Britain--for better or worse--a haven for imperialism and laissez-faire capitalism, is tacked on almost as an afterthought. Of course the political story is the only reason the life of Margaret Thatcher is of any interest, but ironically it's the pitiful story of the elderly, fading Thatcher that holds our interest, strictly because of Streep and Broadbent. If it weren't for them, ""The Iron Lady"" would be a total botch.",1327881600,5,1327,5.200934579439252
4624799,5,B0059XTUXQ,"Meryl Streep is just an amazing actress to watch, perhaps the best in the world. She is like a chameleon; she total disappears into each role she plays, leaving none of her own personality. Just as she vanished into Julia Child and a severe nun, etc, she completely vanishes into Margret Thatcher. So much so that after the movie, I went to the web to remind myself what the real Maggie Thatcher looked like. She looks, sounds and affects the same attitudes even the same hair styles as Maggie! Even her voice has Thatcher sound to it, gestures mannerisms. So astounding you will forget who you are watching.

""The Iron Lady"" is surrounded by ghosts. Streep plays her in snapshots from various parts of her life, but mostly the current Maggie, who, if we believe the plot, suffers from dementia. Current Maggie has long conversations with her husband, Denis Thatcher (played by Jim Broadbent), husband who died in 2003, or his ghost, who she sees but no one else does. She is reluctant to clean out his closet and throw away his clothes even though he has been dead for nearly a decade. He might need them.

We are also shown the Maggie who lead England to war to get back the stolen Falkland Islands, facing striking labour unions, the Maggie who cut government services to lower taxes (mostly to help the rich, critics say). Maggie says ""in the past, people in the country used to `do' things, now they just want to talk about their `feelings'"", or words to that effect. She later repeats this.

This movie not only shows Maggie as terrifying with little sympathy for the people her policies might hurt, but also a great warrior and ultimately pitiable old figure.

 The best actress of 2011. the only reason Streep might not win is she has won so many other times. But her acting will take your breath away. The only movie this year with acting as good as ""The Kings Speech"". Whether you liked Thatcher's politics or not you will marvel at this portrayal.",1327795200,4,1958,4.614942528735632
4624800,2,B0059XTUXQ,"It seems we can't just can't have a normal biographical movie anymore without flashbacks. The flashback style is done for the purpose of showing us how events in someone's past effected their later decisions. Seeing the retired senile Margaret Thatcher was really unnecessary to this film. Can you imagine a Reagan biography starting out with a senile Reagan not knowing he is no longer president and talking to dead people? Unfortunately the senility scenes are needed so we can get to know the character of Marget Thatcher because the main biography part is poorly done with an over abundance of ""red meat"" sound bites.

To make matters worse, the film then employs this technique during the flashback so there is a flashback within the flashback.

I liked the young Margaret Roberts (Alexandra Roach) growing up in a man's world where the expectations of women were to stay out of business and politics. Her bucking the system was inspirational and it would have been a better film had we seen more of this and less of Margaret thinking her husband was still alive.

The meat of the film picks up when she is the Education Secretary of the conservative party. England is facing a union strike crippling the nation. Marget doesn't like her party's leadership and decides to run for the leader of the Conservative Party. She correctly places herself in the hands of professions who tweak her for national appeal, including working on her shrill voice...but she keeps the pearls.

The movie relates to today. England was in a recession and people couldn't pay their mortgage. Margret wanted to cut government spending in the midst of a recession contrary to everyone else, including her own party who worries about re-election. I expected to see a ""Paid for by Ron Paul"" after that speech.

For me, the film becomes watchable when Thatcher has to weigh her decision to go to war over the Falkland Islands. Streep gives us some wonderful performances. But when I see Matthew Marsh miscast as Alexander Haig, I have to ask, ""What were they thinking?""

I went into this film thinking ""5 stars"" but reality set in as they killed this film on the editing floor. Horrifically edited and badly written. Whose idea was it really to have Streep walk around in an old house coat with messed up hair looking acting like Edith Bunker? The scenes of Streep moving through a crowd of faces, speaking her thoughts was another idea that failed. The soundtrack during the file footage scenes was terrible. Streep had a few strong scenes, but not enough to save this film. My advice: read the book.

No f-bombs, no sex, brief nudity on file footage.",1327795200,,2631,4.807522123893805
4624801,3,B0059XTUXQ,"Had anyone but Meryl Streep played Margaret Thatcher in this film, I imagine that ""The Iron Lady"" would be about half as interesting as it actually is. Streep's majestic performance is yet another example of her uncanny ability to inhabit a role so completely and so profoundly that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish between actor and character. Streep nails Thatcher's voice, her tone, her mannerisms, her deportment, every nuance of her identity. Her performance is so remarkable that she actually manages to make Thatcher likeable in a number of scenes. Jim Broadbent is equally impressive as Thatcher's loyal and supportive husband Denis, and the rest of the cast is solid as well. But the real attraction here is Streep--this is a tour de force performance, and it will be difficult indeed to deny her a third Oscar.",1327795200,3,831,5.028985507246377
4624822,3,B0059XTUXQ,"This first paragraph will be filled with statements you either already know or should already know. Meryl Streep is a great actress. The plethora and diversity of the roles she has done is testament to this. And she has an uncanny, chameleon-like ability to adopt, use and make accents work for her character. Because of her ability to create such believable, indelible, interesting characters, she frequently appears in films that are not as memorable as her performance. None of this should come as news to you. And all of this is applicable to ""The Iron Lady"", the new biopic about Margaret Thatcher.

Beginning in ""Current Day"", Thatcher (Streep) ambles down the street, oblivious to most, and wanders into a shop to buy a pint of milk. She is unrecognized, ignored and shocked by the behavior of the people in the shop. Returning home, Denis (Jim Broadbent), her husband, spreads too much butter on his toast earning a chiding remark from his wife. Then, he realizes her assistants are in a tizzy, speaking in whispered tones. Why and how did Lady Thatcher get out and wander around alone? Denis playfully chastises her. An assistant asks her is she is ready to begin sorting through Denis' old clothes, to decide what to donate to charity, which pieces to pass on, which pieces of clothing should just be thrown away. Yes, Denis is gone. She realizes she is a little confused and remembers back to World War II and the Blitz.

Written by Abi Morgan (""Shame"") and directed by Phyllida Lloyd (""Mamma Mia!""),  ""The Iron Lady"" suffers from the same narrative problems as the previous collaboration between the star and the director.

Frankly, I was surprised by how much of ""Lady"" is set in present day. It is interesting to watch Thatcher as she deals with old age, memories haunting and confusing her. Her daughter, Carol (Olivia Colman) shows up and helps her prepare for a dinner party. As she helps her mother get dressed, the television shows a news story about a bombing in Afghanistan. This prompts a memory flash to a similar event early in her political career and helps to set-up the narrative style of the film.

It is fascinating to watch Streep play Thatcher, especially at this stage in her life. In the first scene, as she ambles down the street, it isn't immediately obvious we are watching the former Prime Minister. She looks like any typical old woman, scarf covering her hair, stoop in her back. When we realize it is Thatcher, we immediately feel some regret, some pity. How did one of the most powerful women in history come to this?

Streep makes Thatcher's age, mental fragility, confusion and dread a palpable thing. As she watches the story about the bombing on television, she immediately slips into Prime Minister mode and begins addressing the public. Her daughter and assistant watch with concern on their faces.

Because the film concentrates so much time on Thatcher in her later life, the filmmakers use memories as jumping points to illustrate other parts of her life. This is hardly a modern, innovative or even an engaging method of depicting a person's life story - it's been done thousands, millions of times before - but the simplicity does allow us to concentrate on the characters and story.

But ""Lady"" has two things working against it: The overdone narrative device and director Phyllida Law.

While the narrative device is simplistic and allows us to concentrate on the characters, it is not modern in any way and makes the film seem old-fashioned. Old-fashioned is not an adjective most filmmakers would want used to describe their film. And because the subject matter is basically a senior citizen, the old-fashioned nature of the narrative only seems amplified.

Law comes from a background of theater, opera and music videos. Her first big film ""Mamma Mia!"" an adaptation of the popular musical is good, but the cheap production values and penchant to use music video techniques to illustrate narrative, really bring the overall quality down. I get it. Law has experience with music videos and feels comfortable using this technique. But it doesn't mesh with the ""musical"" narrative of the rest of the film.

In ""Lady"", Thatcher remembering back to key moments in her life and career almost creates a narrative ""promise"" that these flashbacks will provide us with the backstory, the narrative we need and desire to get a more complete picture of the politician's life. A flashback leads to how Margaret and Denis meet. Another flashes back to when they decide to marry. But there is nothing between the two and their marriage is portrayed as a transaction. She loses her first campaign for Parliament and Denis convinces her that a married woman would stand a better chance. If this is in fact true, it doesn't paint a very romantic picture. If it isn't, what are we supposed to pick up from this? We don't get enough details or information to fill in the gaps or make other connections. Only when we watch Margaret and Denis late in their life do we realize that they are now very much in love.

Later, flashbacks lead to a scene of Margaret trying to make an impact in Parliament. Then, another scene shows two of her fellow Conservative Party members giving her coaching, grooming her (somewhat literally) to become the party leader and the PM. A flashback triggers a memory of an IRA attack that kills one of her advisors. Then, she is Prime Minister. Then, things aren't go going especially well. Then, she goes to war in the Falkland Islands. The war goes poorly until the British are victorious and everything turns around for Margaret and the Conservatives and they ride a wave of popularity.

These moments seem almost secondary. If my description of the narrative seems a bit choppy, a bit like an outline, this is an accurate reflection of the film. As Thatcher becomes extremely popular, she is shown dancing with Reagan and Nelson Mandela. This is virtually the only mention of Reagan and does nothing to illustrate their relationship. In fact, the entire sequence, as Thatcher and her party enjoy their power and popularity is basically a montage, a music video, which fails to illustrate anything of value.

At one point, Geoffrey Howe (Anthony Head) begins to appear constantly at Thatcher's side. Later, she berates him and he turns in his resignation. We don't learn what their relationship is or why this is an important development.

The same problem plagues the character played by Richard E. Grant. At one point, someone makes a comment about Thatcher losing support and she turns and spots Michael Heseltine (Grant) looking at her suspiciously. Why are people jockeying to replace her? Who is Heseltine? Why does he want to replace the popular PM? Is she even still popular? Unfortunately, the film doesn't help us with these questions.

Broadbent and Streep work well together and they paint a portrait of a couple who have been together a long time, remembering and laughing at all of the silly memories they share. It is a good portrait of an older couple.

But we don't really learn how they get to this point. There is one brief scene showing Denis and Carol's amazement when Thatcher announces she is running to be Prime Minister. Initially, he seems very upset, but just as quickly seems fully supportive.

There also seems to be a lot of animosity between Carol and her mother, but we don't really learn why this exists.

Law seems convinced that we must know these things and this is a dangerous conceit to adopt when making a biopic. Most successful biopics concentrate on a specific period of the subject's life. By doing this, they are able to illuminate these moments and build what we hope is a memorable portrait. And most biopics are more than two hours long. ""Iron Lady"" runs 105 minutes and presents snippets from throughout the Prime Minister's life. Because of this, it feels like we are watching a study cheat sheet come to life. Key moments, important facts and interesting details are missing throughout.

""The Iron Lady"" features another great performance from Streep, which is not served well by a haphazard screenplay, incomplete ideas and choppy filmmaking.",1327536000,6,8159,4.8645533141210375
4624823,1,B0059XTUXQ,"This was the worst lost opportunity.  So much of the movie was spent in her present day dementia talking to her late husband Dennis.  The Cold War was not even covered except a shot of her dancing with Reagan! We get it - the artistic license to illustrate how we can miss a truly great person in a store and only see an old woman.  Got it.  Could have illustrated that in 4 mins.  Instead it became the most boring time spent with a woman we don't know in her apartment.  The point of a movie is to TELL A STORY.  Not ramble about in present day - we can do that at the mall.  And this is one of the most exciting stories of recent times!  This woman lead a REMARKABLE life.  Yet, you could not find ONE event in the Cold War to cover?  You could not spend more time in her years in Parliament?  It was so boring.  Last year's King's Speech illustrates all that this movie is not - do not stray from the story.  Just chronologically move through the storyline.  The story is already powerful - let it speak for itself.  It is Oscar material and they missed the mark.  And Meryl Streep was AMAZING.  But she could not save the boring travesty that this script reveals.  The screenwriters on this film should never work in this industry again.  One of the WORST.

4624824,1,B0059XTUXQ,"I have no doubt that Meryl Streep plays an excellent Thatcher; but I think that many people outside Britain don't realise how Margaret Thatcher was hated by many in her own country, for her presiding over the decline of British industry, for her closure of the coal mines and selling off natural resources such as Oil; for her privatisation of essential services; for her attempted introduction of the Poll Tax; for her referring to trade unions as ""the enemy within""; for her warmongering in order to win votes (Falklands, Gulf War), and selling off social housing without replacing it by building more houses thus driving the low-paid into the arms of private landlords, or even homelessness. I haven't seen it yet, but I hope this comes over in the film. Oh! and don't forget that finally she was regarded as a liability BY HER OWN CONSERVATIVE PARTY  and was replaced as leader and thus Prime Minister. Enjoy the acting, but never forget the lasting damage she did to our once ""Great"" Britain.",1327536000,10,997,4.796511627906977
4624825,3,B0059XTUXQ,"The Iron Lady, directed by Phyllida Lloyd with a screenplay by Abi Morgan, is something of a mixed bag. On the plus side - and it's a considerable plus - it has bravura performances by Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher and by Jim Broadbent as her husband, Denis. The best parts of the film are when they are on screen together, for those are the times when Streep best brings out Thatcher as something more than her political persona, an image which the film, to its credit, does show as something Thatcher consciously groomed and developed.  And as she so often does, Streep has managed a performance in which she has so deeply immersed herself into the person she's portraying, taking on her accent, her facial expressions, her way of speaking, the actress is nowhere in evidence - it's Thatcher you see and hear on the screen.

That said, however, the film itself is unfortunately something of an incoherent jumble, at least to an American viewer. Much too much of it consists of snapshot episodes and scenes presented with no framing context, a problem made more complicated by the way in which it jumps back and forth in time. It will be interesting to see what British viewers, who are far more likely to have the intimate familiarity with the historical periods and events covered, think of the film. For anyone else however, Thatcher's speeches and actions exist largely in a vacuum, with little to show or explain what she was doing, why she was doing it, and how it fit into the political narrative of the time.  We're shown piles of garbage being left outside 10 Downing Street but nothing about the garbagemen's strike or any of the other strikes going on at the time.  We're shown crowds of protestors shouting at Thatcher but nothing about the closing of plants and coal mines or cuts in services behind the protests, let alone _why_ they were taking place.  We're shown her as Prime Minister during the Falkland Islands War (for about ten minutes) but nothing about what the war was about.  We're shown Thatcher facing being deposed as Prime Minister but nothing about why she'd fallen out of favor in her own party beyond being bullying and abrasive.  One gets the feeling of being rushed through a museum of Thatcher's life but not being allowed enough time to learn anything about any of the exhibits: ""Just time for a quick look"" and then it's ""Move along, move along"".

This lack of context is also felt in the way that most of the other characters in the film, particularly Thatcher's political cohorts and opponents, are never really developed individually, largely serving as a kind of harumphing background chorus and leaving Streep's Thatcher to exist in even more of a vacuum. A few exceptions are worth mentioning however. Harry Lloyd is quite engaging as the young Denis Thatcher who wins a young Margaret (Alexandra Roach) by alternately being supportive and doing little comic turns to make her laugh when he knows she's in need of one. And Anthony Head (yes, the one from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) does a sympathetic job as Thatcher's long time (and eventually long suffering) political ally, Geoffrey Howe. But beyond these limited contributions, it's really left to Streep and Broadbent to carry things along. And when they're on screen together, it works. When they're not, things feel stilted and set-pieced.

Another problem is that Lloyd and Morgan don't seem to have had a clear idea as to just what kind of film they were wanting to make. One gets the feeling that they bit off far more than could be reasonably digested but were unwilling or unable to pare it all down, with the result of reducing Thatcher's life to a series of disjointed snippets, far too many of which were set pieces. No individual part is really bad, and one could see that there were easily three or four different films that they could have made that would have been far more engaging and given a clearer picture of the subject and the period. They could have made an entire film about Thatcher in her declining years, her mind fading, talking to her dead husband, Denis.  These scenes, between Streep and Broadbent, were by far the best and most touching parts of the film they did make.  They could have made a film devoted to her rise to power, or of her transformative years as Prime Minister, or of the period of the Falkland Islands War by itself. But in trying to jam it all into a single film, they have created a film of much flash but little substance.  This could be a result of both the director and writer's relative inexperience in the medium:  Lloyd as director (mostly a stage director, her only credit as a director of a feature film was Mama Mia!, in which Streep also appeared) and Morgan as writer (mostly a writer for television, though she did also write the screenplay for Shame, her only other feature film work).  But whatever the reason, The Iron Lady as a film neither flows nor does it paint a coherent picture, not of its subject and not of the times she lived in.

One particular annoyance I had with the film is that it implies that Thatcher was virtually the only female member of parliament when she was first elected in 1959. In fact, you never, ever, see any other female MP's at any point in the film, in spite of the fact that by 1959 there had been female MP's for forty years and that in the 1959 election there were 25 female MP's elected, 12 for Thatcher's Conservative party and 13 for the Labor party. Granted, in 1959 women still only made up 4 percent of the House of Commons in total, but nonetheless Thatcher was far from being the only one.

Another annoyance was in their ignoring the ""Iron Lady""'s other nickname - ""Snatcher Thatcher"" - and why she was given that particular sobriquet.  They attempt to show Thatcher as being controversial but without any real background as to why - rather a large omission to swallow given that Thatcher was as deeply hated by one half of the UK as she was admired by the other.

Recommended for Streep and Broadbent's sterling performances, but as a film, less breadth would definitely have been more depth. -- Whitt Pond",1327276800,4,6121,4.657089898053753
4624826,5,B0059XTUXQ,"Besides portraying dozens of fictional women-- and one rabbi-- Meryl Streep became Ethel Rosenberg, Julia Child and now Margaret Thatcher. Surely if there is any justice left in Hollywood,  she, just having won the Golden  Globe,  will get an Oscar for her splendid performance as Britain's first and only female prime minister. This movie is not to be missed. While the supporting cast  is superb, particularly Jim  Broadbent as Denis Thatcher in old age, this film  belongs to Streep and Streep alone.  She is in most of the scenes; when she is on screen, it is all about her. There is obviously  no role she cannot play.

The film opens with Mrs. Thatcher debilitated with dementia and flashes back to her days as a young woman-- played by another actress-- and then as prime minister of course. In practically one-half of the movie, we see her in the present when she cannot remember that her husband Denis is dead. There is a particularly poignant scene where she is signing books and mistakenly writes ""Margaret Roberts, "" her maiden name instead of  ""Thatcher."" For those of us who have had family members with dementia, we recognize immediately that Ms. Streep, sad to say, is perfect as this character-- her gait, her vacant stare, her confusion.  And she has all the fire and steel that we associate with Thatcher in her days as prime minister.

While I suspect that Ms. Streep does not share the prime minister's political views, it is easy to see why she chose this role since Mrs. Thatcher, whether you like her or not, had an uphill battle as a woman surrounded by men in government.

The riot and protest scenes are riveting as the prime minister often is driven through them. The soundtrack is beautiful. I recognized ""Casta Diva"" from NORMA and some Bach also.

You will be wrung out at the end of this film but glad you saw it.",1327276800,4,1845,4.654320987654321

""The Iron Lady"" (105 min.) could've/should've been the definitive bio-pic of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's Prime Minister between 1979 and 1991. Instead what we have here is a terrible mess with some great acting. Where to begin? For one, far too much of the movie is devoted to the latter-day's frail Thatcher, in which she believes her husband Dennis is somehow still alive and she cannot get in her mind that her son Mark now lives in South Africa. Why screenwriter Abi Morgan felt compelled to go into this direction, I simply cannot understand. As to the true historical parts of the movie, they are way too fragmented and, crucially, fail to set the proper context so that the viewers can truly grasp their proper historical importance. It felt like watching a reel of highlights, instead of watching a bio-pic of Thatcher's political career. Most damagingly, the plot simply skips on providing insights how certainly key moments came about. As just an example, at a certain point Thatcher decides that she's going to throw her name in the ring to become the next Tories party leader, while all the while we are reminded that it would be highly unlikely for her to succeed. Next thing we watch are the 1979 election results and Thatcher is now PM. Whoa!?! What happened in the party leader challenge? How did Thatcher pull that off? We are left guessing.

Against this background it is truly sad to see the grandiose performance give by Meryl Streep go completely to waste. I don't know that Streep has given a better performance than this one, and surely she will win her third Best Actress Oscar for this. Can you imagine what a stellar movie this could've been had the screenplay made more sense? Instead we are left with this beautifull mess. What a missed opportunity. As a complete aside, I saw 2 movies this weekend and they were both written by Abi Morgan--the other movie being ""Shame"" of course. What are the chances?",1327190400,8,1985,4.784256559766764
4624828,3,B0059XTUXQ,"Watching the movie, The Iron Lady, was only so-so.  However, Streep's performance is worthy of an Oscar.  Wasn't even sure it was she at the beginning of the film. Her portrayal of Thatcher is astonishing!!!!  Truly, it's time to give her the award.  Her last win has been almost thirty years ago for Sophie.  She deserves the Oscar for this movie.  She should have won many times before this.  So let's see what the Academy Awards do this time!!!",1327104000,,447,4.582278481012659
4624829,2,B0059XTUXQ,"Let me begin by saying that I think Meryl Streep is perhaps the most talented actress to EVER appear in films.  It is no coincidence that she has been nominated for Academy Awards and Golden Globes more often than any other person.

That being said, ""The Iron Lady"" is neither a ""crown jewel"" nor a ""feather in her cap.""

There must have been a powerful draw to portray Dame Margaret Thatcher, the first (and so far, only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain. But when I think of recent ""real-life"" biopics like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ray/dp/B001NMYZXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ray</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-s-Speech/dp/B003UESJH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King's Speech</a>"" (or even ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Julie-Julia/dp/B002VXGW2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Julie & Julia</a>"", which featured Streep as famed Chef Julia Child), ""The Iron Lady"" falls short.  Far short.

The film is anchored in a recent time - with Mrs. Thatcher an old widow, at least a little demented and frequented by hallucinations of her dead husband, played by Jim Broadbent in maybe the film's best performance.  The rest of the film is told in clumsy flashbacks, but always returns to doddering old Maggie - Ms. Streep under an often distractingly bad pile of makeup.  Old Margaret shuffles around the house, looks confused, stares out the window, and absolutely sucks any life from the narrative.  (Here the fault lies not with Ms. Streep, but with the screenplay and direction.  And perhaps editor.  Was there no one putting the final product together who looked at ""the forest"" and noticed ""hey... we've got about half of the running time devoted to old Margaret shuffling around, getting in and out of bed, etc.?"")

In REALLY brief don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them flashbacks we see the Margaret who grows up the daughter of a grocer with a political bent, marries a young earnest man who sees that Margaret is determined to become the powerful half of a couple, has twins, runs for office, and is finally thrust forward as Leader of the Conservative Party and elected Prime Minister.

In a good biopic (like last year's King's Speech) you get a good feel for not only the central figure, but also those surrounding.  In ""The Iron Lady"" I never felt any connection to anyone.  Other players, such as daughters, other members of Parliament or American Secretaries of State, show up long enough to be cast aside by the ambitious ""Iron Lady"".

How I wish that this film had reached the scope of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gandhi/dp/B00190N4E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gandhi</a>"" or the emotional depth of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B004SIP98S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>."" The Mrs. and I agreed that it is likely that both Ms. Streep and Dame Thatcher herself are not pleased with the result.  We know we weren't - and it isn't OUR movie.

Addendum: Last Sunday Meryl Streep and her make-up team both won Academy Awards for this film.  Neither of these facts change my opinion.  I read a post-Oscar article that suggested that the Make-up Award was given BECAUSE of Streep's performance.  Perhaps, but that being said, the Mrs. and I saw ""J.Edgar"" since I wrote my original review here - and the ""old age makeup"" for Leonardo DiCaprio was substantially more believable than what we saw in ""The Iron Lady.""  Again - my major beef for this film is not at all related to Ms. Streep's performance or to the makeup, but rather to the overall movie and the amount of time it devoted to depicting a very old and very demented Margaret Thatcher.  Because of the award, someone unfamiliar with Street's total body of work could be tempted to think this performance and film superior to The Deer Hunter, Out of Africa, Bridges of Madison County, Doubt, etc.  IMHO - this would be incorrect.",1327017600,100,4043,5.5810147299509
4624830,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Like some of the other reviewers, I, too, wanted and expected to see many highlights of Margaret Thatcher's life and career. There was very little of that. It seemed like 90% of the movie was spent showing her elderly state of dementia. Yes, Meryl Streep did a superb acting job, as always. But I walked out of the theatre wishing I had not wasted my money watching it. What a huge disappointment.",1326672000,62,397,4.527777777777778
4624831,1,B0059XTUXQ,"Margaret Thatcher is one of the towering historical figures of the 20th Century.  Despite humble origins, she rose to be the United Kingdom's first  female prime minister, and the longest serving prime minister of the 20th century. She took the reins of power in London at a time when the British economy had been decimated by decades of extremist Labor Party policies (anyone remember when Britain nationalized just about every possible industry driving the British automotive and motorcycle industries into the ground?).  Her policies brought the English economy from the depths of recession to dynamic growth. Arguably, she did as much as Ronald Reagan in leading the West to a bloodless victory in the Cold War. As a historical figure of such importance Margaret Thatcher deserves to be the subject of a great biographical film. The Iron Lady is not that film. In fact...Not only is The Iron Lady not a great movie, it's not even a particularly good movie.

The Iron Lady seems to be very poorly structured. Not having read the book on which it's based I can't tell if the fault lies with the writing, the directing, or the source material. Here were have a movie about one of the most important historical movies of the 20th Century and at least 40 minutes of the movie seems to concentrate on Thatcher the elderly woman in the grips of dementia. We get to see her buying milk, going to the doctor, and hallucinating that her husband Dennis Thatcher is still alive. We get to see her finally clean out his closet and send all his clothes to Goodwill (or the British equivalent).  We get to see her daughter and staff worry about her and fuss over her. And this goes on and on.

Watching this movie was an exercise in patience. I wanted to see a biopic that told the story of Margaret Roberts, the daughter of a humble shopkeeper who rose to be the most powerful female leader in the world. I wanted to see how she developed her political philosophy. I wanted to see how she dealt with crisis. But all these parts of her life were no more than touched on, and only then in flashbacks. Alexandra Roach did a great job playing the young Margaret Roberts, a shopkeeper's daughter who got accepted to Oxford University. I wanted to see a lot more of her. But every time that (or any) part of the story seemed to be getting interesting the flashback ended and the audience is taken back to modern day to watch a senile old woman argue with her dead husband. At another point one of her close friend is murdered by an IRA bomb, but do we get to see how she deals with this? No. Immediately the flashback ends and we're back to watching a senile old woman again. Every important moment depicted in the movies is presented the same way, as a short flashback, and totally out of context, that ends just as it's about to get interesting.

The complete and utter failure of this movie may have a lot to do with the choice of Meryl Streep to play Thatcher. With such an A-list character actress as a leading lady, the director and writers structured the movie to highlight Streep's acting, not to highlight the life of the person Streep was portraying. That seems to be the only explanation for why we only got a see a couple moments of Alexandra Roach's wonderful portrayal of the young Margaret Roberts, and a tedious 40 plus minutes of Streep splaying a Thatcher as a senile old woman.

All in all, The Iron Lady is a disappointing mediocre movie that fails as a biopic and fails as historical fiction. If you go in expecting a movie anywhere near as good as The King's Speech, you will be sorely disappointed. Hopefully, someday, someone will make a great biopic about Margaret Thatcher.",1326672000,64,3683,4.586626139817629
4624842,5,B0059XTUXQ,"I did not expect to see anyone portray so thoroughly Margaret Thatcher as an elderly woman, right down to the walking gait and facial expressions that so clearly revealed her conflicting emotions as she looked back on her life and missed the loves of her life who got lost in the demands upon her as a political figure, still mixed with the fervor of a strong self forged in the fire. From the father who inspired her politically strong convictions and educational aspirations, to the warm-hearted husband who believed in her leadership and whose support gave her the courage to take ever bolder steps in leadership, this poignant story is profoundly acted by Meryl Streep. It touched me on so many levels--as an idealist, as a mother, as a woman whose career took her away from her family, as the daughter of a woman who is dealing with the onset of dementia and difficulty separating the past from the present. Margaret Thatcher's inner resoluteness matched the crises she had to face so bravely for so long, propelling her into history and onto the world stage, increasingly taking a toll on her till she mistakenly assumed those loyal to her party would always be loyal to her. The flashbacks are a realisitic experience of world history at the time, with actual news footage in the mix. This is not a biography. You FEEL what Margaret Thatcher felt, you SEE what she saw, you step inside the soul of the person and emerge changed in how you look at your own life.",1326672000,7,1468,4.65
4624843,4,B0059XTUXQ,"It is traditional with reviews about controversial subjects (such as Tony Blair or books by Richard Dawkins) to declare a position so that the reader can make a snap judgment on it if that is their wont. This is precisely the reason I'm not going to. Why? Firstly such things should not be a factor when judging a film and, secondly, if you're less than the age of 40 (as ironically most people who debate the subject are), then your views probably have more to do with where you grew up, rather than firsthand experience.

So, what is `The Iron Lady' like? As you may know from other reviews, Meryl Streep's performance is first rate and this is not just hyperbole as most of the post-cinema conversations I heard were of people saying the same thing.

There is also credit due to the rest of the cast and the director as almost everything about the film comes off as eerily similar to the real thing (although Denis Thatcher seemed a bit more `wild' in real life than he is portrayed here, and many of the Conservative figures (except Richard E. Grant) are not as identifiable as they should be).

The plot too is cleverly worked out, showing Thatcher's political life through the lens of a dementia patient. It struck me that even if all `Margaret Thatcher' had ever done was being a fiercely competitive flower arranger; the portrayal would still have the same - i.e. neutral and mostly fair.

And this same strength - a fresh perspective - may also be its greatest weakness. In exploring Lady T's dementia, the politics are rather left aside. You almost feel like you want them to say something to offend you, rather than by mild inference, and the film may be seen as too much of a whitewash of the significant events of her premiership.

That said, striking the right balance with films on controversial subjects is always tricky, as inevitably the bias of the director comes through. The fact that Lady Thatcher has refused to see the film may be a sign that the author hasn't pandered to her too much, just as the fact that the film is being boycotted on Tyneside shows that it is clearly too close to the truth for comfort.

In my humble opinion, then, a good film, if a little light on politics. Although the film seems to have sparked a revival in Thatcher-bashing, it's good to see that someone has finally taken much of the venom out of the subject and given it a breath of fresh air.",1326585600,,2398,4.5265588914549655
4624844,2,B0059XTUXQ,"I saw this movie last night and I was looking forward to seeing it.  I don't count myself as a fan of Thatcher's politics, but I do admire her as a person.  She had an important role in the fall of the Soviet states and in transforming the American political role in the world.  Therefore, I hoped to enjoy a biographical movie that of course would include much of the usual literary license that is part of the Hollywood operation.

What I got, though, left me empty.  The role of Thatcher was certainly well performed by Streep and there is nothing for me to add from what others have stated and will state.  I'm sure she will obtain another Oscar nomination.  If that is all that interests you in movie going, then enjoy!  But for those of you with more of an intellectual side, I would suggest waiting for the DVD to rent.

The central problem I believe is that the makers wanted to portray the strong, independent woman, but I have to believe that they dislike her politics and they could not allow a movie viewer the opportunity to agree with the conservatism of Thatcher-especially in a presidential election year.  They missed no chance to attach a failure (implied or factual) for any Thatcher success and if that wasn't enough, they portrayed her as a lonely, dementia suffering, old woman for whom time has left behind and for whom the political world has completely forgotten.  Here is what troubled me the most; this is a movie about an important political ally for whom one would be ashamed to show the movie to that person.  Well, one Should be ashamed anyways.

What also troubles me is that Streep has too much say so in her movies at this stage of her career.  She should have stepped in and said, ""Enough with these hallucinations, let's show more of this woman's actual career!""  Too bad she did not.",1326585600,407,1820,4.539877300613497

A Story of a Strong Woman  and ... the at times gut wrenching life of an elderly woman trying to keep herself from going mad.  This story wraps you in from the beginning and has you rooting for the ol' gal to win it all and near the end an emotional farewell.  But the other story is her dealing with the ails that come along with aging.  There is an obvious compare and contrast between what is now and what is then.  Those that look at this incredible screen play with any political ideology will miss the beautiful story about a powerful charismatic woman that defied all the odds.  I have more curiosity for Margaret Thatcher after watching than I did before this movie.  While I am not a fan of her political ideologies, and also not a Brit, for me the movie accentuates Thatcher's human element which coming from an ironclad figure head is an interesting perspective.  She fought for what she believed to be what was just and what was right.  Regardless of what your political position is, if you agree or disagree with her politically, this movie was elegantly crafted and did not in the least diminish the memory of her 11 year historic rule.  It showed the raw visceral power that was and still is the incredible, delightful and powerful Margaret Thatcher.",1326585600,6,1333,4.582278481012659

What I can say without reservation is that Meryl Streep gave an outstanding performance. She played Margaret Thatcher in her prime and also in her declining years. In both cases, she had Thatcher's voice and mannerisms down pat. I believed she was Thatcher.

What I regretted about this movie was the script which centered around Thatcher in declining health, at times hallucinating and reflecting on her life and career at which point we relive them as well. We saw the influence her early family life had on her future in conservative politics. Also shown were her early forays into politics and then on toward being Prime Minister. What was annoying to me was that the film had us all too frequently go back to Thatcher in old age, rather than spend more time on Thatcher as Prime Minister.  Granted the film did depict some of the strife with the IRA, the effects in England of not negotiating with the labour unions and the Falklands War but they seemed all too fleeting.

During Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister, countries were economically and politically repositioning themselves re globalization and the end of the Cold War. Thatcher was also continuing England's special relationship with the United States via Ronald Reagan with whom she was politically in synch. In the film, if old-age Thatcher were to reflect, we should have gone back and relived those times and stayed there until she reached the old age Thatcher as she was reading the headlines of today or something along those lines.

This movie must be seen for Meryl Streep's performance for which there are not enough superlatives. She was great and well worth the price of admission.  Maybe there is another movie yet to be made about Margaret Thatcher and her political influence in England and the world. She was a dynamic person to be sure.",1326585600,3,2024,4.832369942196531
4624847,1,B0059XTUXQ,"The Iron Lady is the worst picture of the year! The writer, director, and Meryl Streep used their far left political views to dismiss Margret Thatcher's greatness down to an old lady who is loosing her mind to dementia. Using flash back story telling to show her rise to becoming Prime Minister of England, the story line leans left and does not give Margret Thatcher her due as a great conservative leader.  I walked away from this movie disappointed.  My recommendation is don't buy this movie.",1326499200,20,496,4.755813953488372
4624848,2,B0059XTUXQ,"Apparently based on Mrs. Thatcher's autobiography, the screenplay to this movie suffered from a paucity of relevant and interesting human content. Surely there is an interesting story yet to be told (by a better set of screenwriters) about a commoner who ascended the British class ladder to take on Parliament's exclusive ""old boys club,"" and in the process attained the vaunted position of British Prime Minister. But the moviegoer will find no such story in this mishmash of a movie. For, despite Meryl Streep's above average performance, what the moviegoer will see is bits and pieces of a self-important personality strung together by a script moving back and forth across time willy-nilly seemingly without much rhyme or reason. I have no doubt that anyone shuffling the events of Margaret Thatcher's life randomly could have come up with a better more coherent screenplay than the one seen here.

What we get here instead of a robust coherent biographical story is a loose cinematic collage of a thinly drawn cardboard cutout of a personality devoid of a personal life, one that should have been interesting but in the end was anything but. Like Mr. Obama in the U.S. Mrs. Thatcher may have been a trail-blazing British first, but that alone does not guarantee that her life and times will make for an interesting historical or cinematic story.

What we have here at most is an interesting outline full of randomly placed historical events, loosely attached to a professional life that is devoid of any meaningful non-public human content.

My wife and I debated why this might have been the case? Maybe the screenwriters adhered too closely to a bland autobiography? Or, maybe their deadlines for completing the script were just too tight and what fell out was this monstrosity of a movie? Who knows? Two Stars",1326499200,14,1818,4.973684210526316
4624849,1,B0059XTUXQ,"This is a bad film. Its an attempt at covering a life in scattered flashbacks from the pespective of old age. It ends up being rootless and impressionistic. Somewhat like a short TV clip show biography shown when someone has died. All the right notes are struck but nothing of the slightest importance is communicated. The script is superficial, empty and ultimately meaningless.

Its difficult to comment on the acting of Meryl Streep given that the role and the script give her nothing of any particular greatness to do. Rather than acting, what seemed to be required in the part was the skills of a mimic and for an older woman (she IS 62) to play an older woman. To be fair, thats what most people want in this sort of thing. They are far less interested in acting than in simply re-creating. I guess I can praise her for giving the masses what they wanted.

She is doing what became somewhat of a staple for older male actors on broadway for a while. A famous person is mimiced over a superficial coverage of their life and everyone wallows in a fit of nostalgia for both the person and the actor playing the person.

The two most dramatically interesting parts of her life are her improbable rise & transformation into(or creation of) the ""Iron Lady"" between 1974 and 1979. And her fall from office. But the film is so committed to the ""official"" story of her life that it misses all of the dramatic promise of both events.

Its going to give Meryl Streep another award for the mantle. But if she had any respect for herself or her profession, she would turn it down. She did nothing here worthy of note.

In the end, the film is kind of like going to see Disney's animatronic Abe Lincoln. Technically amusing but not interesting and ultimately an empty experience.",1325548800,21,1771,4.556603773584905
4624850,5,B0059XTUXQ,"Some reviewers have panned ""The Iron Lady,"" directed by Phyllida Lloyd from a screenplay by Abi Morgan.  They resent the filmmakers' portrayal of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of the most controversial political figures of the twentieth century, as an elderly woman in decline.  Lloyd shows Thatcher having hallucinations, during which she converses with her departed husband, Denis.  She is forgetful, distracted, and lives more in the past than in the present.  Other critics have suggested that ""The Iron Lady"" gives short shrift to Thatcher's political career, placing too much emphasis on her personality and her relationship with family and colleagues.

It is unfair to condemn the movie that Lloyd and Morgan should have made.  ""The Iron Lady"" is not meant to be a conventional biopic that focuses solely on how Thatcher's conservative policies affected Great Britain between 1979 and 1990.  Lloyd and Morgan have a different purpose in mind--to examine what drove Margaret Roberts to embark on a political career; the difficulties she faced juggling marriage, parenthood, and her busy work schedule; and the price that she (and some might say her country) paid for her stubborn adherence to what she considered to be non-negotiable principles. We observe Thatcher's life through the prism of her memories, as she recalls events from her girlhood, courtship with Denis, and turbulent years in office.

Meryl Streep is exceptional as Margaret Thatcher.  Her facial expressions, carriage, and voice perfectly convey Thatcher's ambition, single-mindedness, and determination.  Streep also reveals her subject's flaws:  Thatcher could be petty, unfeeling, and domineering.  The most poignant and memorable scenes depict Mrs. Thatcher more than two decades after she retired as frightened, confused, lonely, and preoccupied with bygone events.  Jim Broadbent is superb as Denis, who applauded his wife's triumphs but resented her bossiness and obstinacy. There are wonderfully humorous moments and some scenes that may reduce the audience to tears.  The movie is not perfect.  At times the script and the score are heavy-handed and manipulative. However, most viewers will understand if not empathize with the grocer's daughter who attended Oxford and went on to govern Great Britain for over a decade.  Right or wrong, she was destined to make history.",1325462400,89,2363,5.46831955922865
4624851,4,B0059XTUXQ,"""The Iron Lady"" is a biographical drama film of the life of Baroness Margaret Thatcher.

The narrative focuses on an aging Thatcher with fading health, reflectively looking back on her life and career.

It was ambitious of the film directors to try and incorporate so many facets of Thatcher's life into a single feature film. This is because several aspects of her life are significant enough to be separate films. For example her rise within the Conservative Party as a female politician or the Falklands War both contain enough depth to be separate films. Notwithstanding this the viewer is presented with numerous major events in Thatcher's life such as: her admittance to Oxford University as the daughter of a green grocer, her progression as a Conservative Member of Parliament, tenure as Leader of the Opposition, and eleven years as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The quality of acting is engaging and this film honourably acknowledges Thatcher's breakthrough political career.

I am amazed that someone actually got a ton of money to create a Hollywood movie with such a poor script (hey there, movie producers, if you have money to invest/waste in such bad scripts, I can guarantee that I can provide a movie script for you for half of what you spent on this one)and/or poor directing! As other reviewers have noted, it focuses mainly on portraying a doddering elderly woman suffering from dementia and nostalgia. Margaret Thatcher was one of the most powerful leaders of her time - how about focusing mainly on her accomplishments and challenges throughout her life?? The film then overuses flashbacks to try to show Ms. Thatcher's earlier life, but without providing any time, location and other important identifiers for viewers to be able to understand what the flashback is showing. It's like a really poorly-stitched together patchwork quilt - it looks crappy and falls apart at the seams. We watched 15 minutes, skimmed ahead to see if it would get any better, realized it would not, then quit and went on to watch something else. Meryl Streep's immense talent is wasted on this poorly-executed attempt at a film.",1528156800,,1275,4.880184331797235
8463075,2,B0059XTUXQ,"Stylistically great, of course, but the storyline is a shameful hit-job, as it was intended to be:  A smear piece.  Thatcher is portrayed in the piece alternately as either a naive, prim and prudish young woman, a sad senile geriatric desperately attempting to hold onto dignity and sanity, or else an emotionally sheltered, unjustifiably cocky and dogmatic strutting prima donna (her PM years, which appear as flashbacks).  It's a shame that this is what all the big $$ and Hollywood talent are channeled into establishing as what will inform public perception of the legacy of this remarkable woman who was massively consequential far beyond the borders of her own country, but who, together with Reagan really drove a stake through the heart of the vile despised totalitarian Soviet empire that ruled the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as puppet dictatorships out of the Kremlin for decades after the horrors of WWII had ended for the rest of Europe.  It's a sign of the demoralization and ideological brainwashing that's been done to kids in Britain and America today that you have them romanticizing this evil Soviet and Marxist nonsense that they had zero personal or family experience with, that enslaved and killed millions over generations, and that required the moral integrity and valiant dedicated effort of many courageous people to defeat.  Baroness Thatcher was an instrumental fighter in that struggle for freedom and human dignity.  If you don't love her every policy or position, that's your right.  But it's incontestable that Thatcher is a significant figure in world history and she really deserves a greater degree of respect than this inane, nasty hit job.  And once again, of course, the film-making is impeccable here--it's the project itself, the writing, and the initiative to put these resources into creating this smear-piece, that's really obscene and clueless.  A slap in the face from the lefty Hollywood bubble.",1527033600,,1953,5.174603174603175

8463079,4,B0059XTUXQ,Good film! Amazing cast. Her earlier career is mostly shown through flashbacks the film is focused on the later part of her life. Definitely hard to watch if you have loved ones in that stage of life. But great over all!,1520899200,,220,4.390243902439025

8463081,2,B0059XTUXQ,"The flashback segments to Her time as prime minister were fascinating.  But way way to much time was spent on all the present day, I guess setting up the flashbacks.  You have to watch long uninteresting probably total fictional present time segments to get to the interesting parts about her time as Prime Minster.  All the present day was about she's old, perhaps becoming senile,  hallucinating that her deceased husband is still with her - really like I care I wanted to watch The Iron Lady in action, not go on and on about her sad ""present day"" self..",1519344000,,557,4.595959595959596
8463082,4,B0059XTUXQ,"So, i'm sensitive to ""left wing"" biased portrayals, and I didn't find that as strongly as some reviewed here.  For me, the view into Thatchers life from her later years coping with dementia and profound grief was emotional and impactful, I could relate.  Perhaps her political achievements were slightly downplayed.  But I felt this was a very well told story, from which I really understood Thatcher, both the incredible historic accomplishment as well as the sacrifices that she made with being the first female leader of her kind.  You might call this very strong on the human angle, and for me it took nothing from her incredible biography.",1519171200,,644,4.935185185185185
