2696488,3,B000KN7BMW,"This movie has a good premise but inconsistencies with the story and plot really drag it down. For instance, a couple goes to this place and their guide has a thing for the guy and comes up with a scheme to get him alone. Well, it's the guy who ends up flirting with the guide and then it's the guy who gets angry when he finds out the guide's motives. And how he found out is a mystery. They fall asleep on the beach in each other's arms and then the guy all the sudden wakes up and says ""How dare you!"" It's like WTF just happened?

And then he goes back to the hotel room and tells his finance that he just had sex with the guide even though that didn't happen. uhh...?

This movie could have used a lot of improvement. A better script and about 20 extra minutes would have made this a good movie. But it's still worth a rental when there is NOTHING else to rent and you're desperate for something to watch.",1187308800,3,910,4.106741573033708
2696489,1,B000KN7BMW,"Wow!

All the acting, directorial, and technical finesse of a home video made by someone who just bought his first camera!

I'm sure everyoine involved had tongue firmly in cheek.

At least I hope they did.

Pee-yew!",1177718400,,216,4.756756756756757
2696490,1,B000KN7BMW,"One star for effort. This is truly an awful film. Clearly the screenwriter/Director needs to review some film school classes and pay attention this time. The script is so poor that the actors don't really have a chance. I'm not altogether sure that given a decent script they'd be much better but I do believe in the benefit of the doubt. Obviously shot with a small video camera sans dolly and with a very small pan ratio,the camera once placed in each set seems rooted there. The editing is at best abrupt. Lighting  by sun-guns. Hasn't the sound guy heard of wind-screens?  Pretty much an amateur effort throughout.

I think this is an interesting script idea, it is unfortunate that it couldn't have been better realized.",1175731200,3,725,4.738095238095238
2696491,3,B000KN7BMW,"Now and then we see early films by a well-trained and well-educated writer/director and enjoy the journey from amateur to professional status. Jorge Ameer has been actively and consistently making films since 2000 (with an earlier 1994 work) and it is therefore disappointing that he has not been able to garner financial backing to step beyond the low budget status that grounds his latest feature CONTADORA IS FOR LOVERS.  Why is that happening?

For starters Ameer needs to assign the writing of his screenplays to others, find a competent cinematographer with the right equipment to step beyond the video state, and spend time with his actors in rehearsal and polish before the film is committed to the can.  This particular film demonstrates all of those flaws. The story - an engaged couple Mike (Vincent De Paul) and Maria (Christina Antelo) arrive on the off-Panama island of Contadora where they are warmly received by host Gabriel (Tony Sago) - has a good setup, but very quickly turns into an impractical love triangle with the bifurcated aspects of each character skipped over so quickly that the progress of the interrelationships just falls flat.  Gabriel is gay and manages to swoop Mike off for a hike on the island Gabriel 'knows like the back of his hand' only to 'get lost' and spend the night on the beach where some very rusty and insensitive  attempts to show attraction and rejection are shown.  Barely questioning the previous night's events Maria works back into the vacation and touches of ambiguity fizzle like water on hot rocks.  It seems Ameer wants to explore bisexuality but just doesn't understand the conflicts well enough to place words in the mouths of his actors.

Each of the actors is attractive and at the beginning of the film there is hope that they can also act.  But the script and the filming and direction  prevent this little travelogue crew from sinking with the sunset.  Maybe next time....Grady Harp, March 07",1174176000,,1959,4.906060606060606
2696492,3,B000KN7BMW,"Must be seen to be believed. Nutball direction (camera shakes, off-kilter framing), ludicrous script (with some lines repeated verbatim in successive scenes), and awful acting add up to this so-terrible-it's-great-fun entry. Completely entertaining in a perverse sort of way. It does have a sweet, innocent feel, but disparate elements keep that sentiment at bay. Three stars for high camp; one if you are taking this seriously.",1172793600,,428,5.5

2696512,1,B000KN7BMW,"This is truly the worst excuse for a movie that I have ever seen. The lighting is horrible, the sound is horrific. This was definitely an amateur attempt at making a movie.

8158256,1,B000KN7BMW,"The story had the potential to be good. Unfortunately, the shoddy writing and editing made it just north of unwatchable. For instance, in one scene the married couple are talking excitedly about the friendliness of the resort staff. Then the couple enter their room and proceed to repeat that conversation word for word. Clearly, one scene was to have been edited out, but that didn't happen. The sound quality also was uneven at best, with less-than-stellar lighting.

Implausibilities and plot contrivances abound. How often in movies like this does one half of the straying pair magically get some excuse to be away from the other half for an extended period? ""Oh, go without me, honey. You two go on and tour the whole island in what becomes an overnight trip while I do something unspecified. Only hours later will I realize that, hey, something here isn't right."" And the tour guide's completely predictable ""Oh, maybe I don't know the island as well as I thoughtlooks like we're lost"" approach was neither fresh nor original. Cue the 1970s porn music. And then, oddly enough, the woman gets over her feelings of betrayal and then the mnage  trois commences in earnesthowever unrealistically. The three become friends, interspersed with minor conflicts and drama.

8158257,1,B000KN7BMW,"Proof once again that Amazon has a knack for dredging the depths for the lowest form of ""cinema""!!! As one reviewer mentioned, being under the influence might assist in sticking this one out (no pun intended). This film justifies creation of a category way, way below B film. Do I hear a C, D, F???  Of the gay-themed options reviewed for this evening's dinnertime viewing, this seemed to be the one with some possibility (compared to the trailers for others recently added). Luckily, a fine bottle of Carmenere helped us ''survive."" The greater existential question: Does a creation(?) like this warrant sympathy for the director, actors and production crew or should they be encouraged to seek alternate career paths???? And what's up with the Andean flute music toward the end??  That the guide who supposedly knows this less than a mile sized island like the back of his hand finds himself lost, represents the ""deeper"" symbolism of this film: a lost cause.",1504224000,,961,4.925925925925926

8158259,1,B000KN7BMW,"Thankfully I was under the influence, so this was hilarious. It'seems like these people went on vacation and made this to pass the time. And I say ""people,"" not ""friends,"" because there was zero chemistry between any of them. Everything was awful from the top down.

EVERYTHING!

The directing was nonexistent, the script was... Was there even a script? Oh yeah, there must have been. Why else would they repeat the exact same lines at the end of the scene when they arrive at their building and the beginning of the next scene as they walk into their room?! Obviously, no one paid attention to editing. The sound varies to the point that you can barely hear them if they're outdoors. The camera suddenly pans and zooms in as if the person operating it was dozing off. Even the props! What was up with that exploding pillow?

The acting was at the level of a grade school production AT BEST. Were the long pauses there for dramatic purposes, or did they forget their lines? And the woman seemed to almost laugh during ""serious"" scenes.

I assume you get the gist by now. If you can't laugh at bad movies, steer clear. If you CAN laugh at awful films, this truly is possibly the most awful ""film"" I have ever seen. But man, did I laugh.",1499385600,,1235,4.475555555555555
