8423527,5,B004CRT81O,"One of the greatest 80's exploitation flicks made. Everything awesome is in this post-apocalyptic horror, sci fi, action, sleaze fest. You're going to love it.",1488067200,,159,5.4
8423528,5,B004CRT81O,"I first saw this movie years ago as a young kid and I remembered there was this crazy late night movie about girls rollerskating through the desert and getting fed to this monster that lived in a refinery.

I had tried for years to track it down, but to no avail. The last time I saw a copy for sale it was a beat up old VHS on eBay for over $100.  Thank you Amazon for providing this classically bad film at a reasonable price and on DVD.",1363737600,,439,3.977272727272727
8423529,3,B004CRT81O,"As it says, this is a DVD-R, made when ordered. It's OK, but the source is obviously tape, not the original film. It's a decent tape transfer as they go, and it appears uncut, so it's hard to complain TOO much... but the original film would be so much cleaner.",1353110400,4,260,4.22
