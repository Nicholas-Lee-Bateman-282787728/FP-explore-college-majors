8228511,2,B000XJD3DE,"Before he was making assloads of cash with Love Hina and Negima, Ken Akamatsu did a one-shot manga story that was turned into this 2-episode OVA. One X-Mas Eve, a lonely young man named Santa(yep, Santa!)is spending another year without his parents who're out helping unfortunate kids somewhere else in the world. So, he is visited by Mai, one of several teenage girls that works for Santa Claus, since he apparently fired all the elves for sexy Japanese girls. Mai has the power to turn into a tall blonde girl only on Christmas Eve, and takes Santa on a trip around the world to see the good his parents do. We cut ahead a few months later to an obligatory ""beach episode"" where we're introduced to even more of Santa's little helpers showing in in bikinis. This was a cute short OVA series, which hinted that there was going to be a 3rd episode complete with a giant reindeer mecha fight, but it turned out to be a gag ending.",1355529600,,929,4.470588235294118
8228512,4,B000XJD3DE,This item was purchased as a Christmas Gift.  It was an item that was part of a long list of anime and it was very well received.,1326758400,,129,3.7777777777777777
8228513,5,B000XJD3DE,"That Mai (a student at the Santa Claus Academy) has a reindeer named 'Pedro' would be enough to get me to watch this ""Magic Girl"" anime. This over-the-top insanity is a vid I'll probably watch every Christmas and share with my G'Sons when they get older. If it wasn't for the brief shower scene, it could be watched by the younger crowd.
Sometimes I needed to put on the English subtitles because the words were flying so fast especially in the conjuring scenes where Mai and Sharry (an elite in Santa Claus Academy) battle it out.",1228435200,,531,4.541666666666667
8228514,4,B000XJD3DE,"I watched this series and I loved it but i think it should of been longer. The story was moving so fast and by the time i got to figure what the whole story is about it just ends. The part that really moved fast was the ending and yet in the beginning of episode 2 there is about 15 minutes of footage they could of left out or make it into 3 episodes instead of just 2 episodes on this disc. Overall, its a great anime with awesome dubbed voice acting but if they made the series into like 3 or 4 episodes it will be more worth it. There is some nudity when the girls transform into bustier girls. This is not Ken Akamatsu's greatest work in anime but its worth giving a shot. The storyline is excellent. I wouldnt recommend this anime to just any anime fan but i believe people would enjoy this because of the background story behind it and have girls transform into Santa's helpers *note they are not elves*.",1200096000,,911,4.181818181818182
8228515,4,B000XJD3DE,"I've been an Akamatsu fan for a couple years now and I've enjoyed this short two OVA series, as well as the Manga.
Though I think the dub of Mai was a bit off, I understand how hard it would be to voice such an outrageous girl.
If your an Akamatsu fan then this is a must for your collection. If you've never read or watched something created by Ken Akamatsu then I think this would be a good place to start. Though, if you don't like fan service then this may put you off a bit.
'My Santa' is a funny and out there romantic comedy, much like his other works, and is sure to make even the biggest of holiday scrooges at least chuckle.",1199577600,3,634,4.0396825396825395
