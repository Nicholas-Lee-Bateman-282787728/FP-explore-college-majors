8185448,4,B000OJENCI,"For those who are new to lacrosse Mark Million is one of the greatest offensive players of all time.  The video features Mark breaking down vital offensive skills such as stick protection, dodging, and shooting.  Mark does a good job explaining things, includes little tips along the way, and drills are suggested for each skill block.  The production quality is very good, with only a few occasions where the wind is audible.  Highlight videos are included showcasing Mark's skills for each skill block, which are just fun to watch.  If you can find this on sale somewhere I highly recommend picking it up.",1259020800,,607,4.854368932038835
