3698754,5,B001MT0DMS,"I was able to work out at the gym daily through my sixth month of pregnancy, but when it became too much (and my gym pass expired) I struggled to find an enjoyable way to keep moving. If only I had bought this DVD a lot sooner!

Amira gives concise and understandable instructions for exercises that almost any pregnant woman can do (I can do them, and I'm at 37 weeks!). The movements are gentle, fun, and relaxing, but best of all, I feel they are useful in preparing me for my upcoming childbirth. And my little one seems to enjoy them, too!

Amira says many positive and affirming things along the way. She encourages you to respect the limitations of your body and not overdo anything. She looks like a pregnant goddess and glows with respect for her body.

I wasn't too impressed with the extra footage - the interviews and such - but really, the workout alone was worth the purchase. It's a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone!",1232496000,18,943,4.408045977011494
3698755,5,B001MT0DMS,"I love this DVD.  Amira does an excellent job breaking down moves, setting an inviting atmosphere, and passing along some very important information.  The performances are beautiful and inspirational.  The interviews are great.",1232323200,2,227,5.818181818181818
3698756,5,B001MT0DMS,"I bought this DVD for my pregnant friend and we watched it together. I wish this sort of information was around when I was pregnant. I never knew that belly dance historically is a ""birth dance"". It makes all makes sense now. This DVD will help you to get ready for birth not only physically but also mentally. None of the other pregnancy DVDs go in so much depth like this this one does. AND ITS OVER 3 HOURS LONG. I also loved the interviews with belly dance mothers very much. There is so much information on this DVD, it'll take you days to watch it all through. I think every woman, pregnant or not, should know this information, it'll make you appreciate yourself more, the woman you are. Great job Amira, this DVD was well needed.",1231632000,6,737,4.386861313868613
3698757,2,B001MT0DMS,"Just to preface: I've been jokingly described by my students as hippie and ""granola,"" and I'd like to think I'm a very open-minded person.  Also, I find eastern philosophy truly enlightening in many respects, and I enjoy yoga and belly dancing, so I thought this would be perfect as a relaxing alternative to the more intense prenatal cardio and sculpting I typically do to stay active and strong during this pregnancy.  As an on-again-off-again professor of rhetoric, I should have paid closer attention to the ""mind conditioning"" part of the DVD's title: I found myself rolling my eyes, getting annoyed at the constant lecturing and obvious bias, and just wanting some relaxing music and brief instruction so that I could relax and do my thing.  I didn't want an extended history lesson while stretching or opinions about eastern vs. western birthing techniques, and I certainly don't need a spiritual guide in the form of an RN belly dancer; I have (many) books and articles for history and medical advice, and I'm a bit too, well ""secular"" shall we say, for all the overt (and I mean OVERT) heaven and god talk, something I have never encountered during an actual yoga or belly dancing class.  Sure, talk about becoming one with the things around you, finding one's center, nature, earth, aligning the chakras, or whatever, and it would work for me; there was something about the attempt at sounding soothing that bugged me, too, as though it were forced, self-conscious, and performative.  If you have sensitive ears for performative tones and cadences of speech, you'll quickly pick up on what I'm saying.  I'm 5 months pregnant and all I felt with this DVD were boredom and frustration, not because the exercises were difficult but because they were repetitive and completely effortless.  This DVD simply doesn't do it for me, and I, personally, didn't find it fun or enjoyable.",1434672000,4,1885,4.927444794952681
3698758,5,B001MT0DMS,Fun workout. I really like Amira.  She talks about the history of belly dancing and what the moves are doing for you/baby.  You can bypass the talking if it is not your thing.,1424908800,,175,4.2727272727272725

3698765,5,B001MT0DMS,LOVED doing this workout while pregnant. I  believe excersize helps keep your body healthy during pregnancy with all it goes thru. I had no problems at all and I believe it was due to my workouts. This disc was awsome,1412208000,2,217,4.425
3698766,5,B001MT0DMS,"I purchased this half through my first trimester. I have been extremely fatigued and have been a belly dancer for many years. The pacing of this video is perfect for me and I don't feel like I'm over exerting myself. I appreciate that at times she starts to look tired at the end of the exercise and  when I am also getting tired, so you feel like you can actually relate to her.  It's a very relaxing and strengthening DVD. If you lift or exercise heavily before your pregnancy you, may find this too easy. However, with the fatigue and unpredictable energy levels that come with pregnancy I found this to be prefect for me. The DVD also includes interviews with belly dancers and their birth experiences.",1409443200,,706,4.551181102362205
3698767,1,B001MT0DMS,I really wanted to try this video but my DVD didn't work even after mailing it back for an exchange.  Having the same problem with the 2nd DVD.,1405641600,,143,4.107142857142857

3698769,5,B001MT0DMS,"All the moves and advise kept me flexible and fit through out pregnancy. Amira coves lots of stretching in the hip, which I feel made my labor as smooth as it could have been. Also being able to do the moves she covers in labor, made a natural labor much easier then sitting in bed.",1404777600,,282,4.1454545454545455
3698770,5,B001MT0DMS,"I have been having really achy hips and I am hoping that continuing to use this workout will help ease that ache. I know some people have said this doesn't feel like a workout, but if you are someone who is mostly inactive, it definitely feels like one!  It really takes a lot of strength and willpower to keep your knees lightly bent for so long if you aren't used to doing so. And it is also a bit difficult to circle your hips and keep your ribs still, and vice versa.  And my arms were aching after the arm movement section because having them up for so long is just not something I'm used to!

So, no, this is not for if you want to really sweat and have a good cardio workout. If you are mostly inactive and need to stretch and get in some exercise, or maybe just feel like you're a bit more enticing and sexy and not feel like a huge cow sometimes during your pregnancy, this is a great DVD to pick up.

I am going to come back after my labor and report on if the strengthening and labor exercises helped me. I doubt I'll get to try the birthing position the DVD recommends, but I am hopeful that the techniques given will make my labor easier and help turn my baby into the right position.",1404777600,,1197,4.124463519313305

3698778,5,B001MT0DMS,"What I like best about the video was how aware it was of the different skill levels of people who might be watching it, providing lots of alternative moves if some were too difficult, encouraging breaks for water between moves, and having guided pulse checks to make sure your heart rate isn't too high. All of these things made me feel at ease while watching the video.

Some of the content wasn't very interesting - the interviews in particular. And occasionally I had to concentrate to understand what Amira was saying since she has an unusual accent. Overall, for anyone looking for alternative exercises I would recommend this video.",1398556800,,638,4.853211009174312

But this was so new-age and kooky that I couldn't make it through the workout.  Also, It's not much of a workout. It might be great for someone who is new to yoga and movement, but it wasn't intense enough for me. I know some people really like this DVD; it just wasn't for me.

3698781,4,B001MT0DMS,"I wouldn't call this a workout and don't think it is necessary early in pregnancy but is great practice for labor.  I think some of the warm ups are good positions to be in throughout pregnancy.  If you use this early on, it probably isn't needed more than once a week but as your pregnancy progresses you may find it more and more beneficial.  There is lots of instructions, so great for a beginner to belly dancing but doesn't have very much yoga.  Anyone can do this.",1393891200,,470,4.367816091954023

3698787,5,B001MT0DMS,"I got this video when I was about 28 weeks along and have enjoyed the movements. I regularly do yoga and I have belly-danced a bit in the past, so the movements were very familiar, and normally I would not consider this a work out, but with my current belly size, this is perfect for me. I now get winded when I climb a flight of stairs! I enjoyed hearing the birth experiences of the women who were interviewed. I only wish I had gotten the video sooner because some of the movements are not recommended for women who are over 30 or 32 weeks (I forget which), so I only had a short time to be able to do them.  The video is a bit long for my morning routine, it is well over an hour, so I rarely complete the whole thing, instead I mix and match the 3 ""work out"" sections depending on how much time I want to spend, beginning and ending with warmup and cool down.",1378684800,,864,4.052631578947368
3698788,5,B001MT0DMS,"I bought several pregnancy workout videos, and thought it would be a good idea to write a review of all of them at once: Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy; 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates; Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga; Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1; Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout.  Let me start this by saying that before my pregnancy, my level of fitness was somewhere in between couch potato and world-class athlete  I usually worked out a few times a week, doing 20-30 minutes cardio and some light weight-lifting, but was not running marathons or anything like that.  I wanted to maintain a similar level of fitness during my pregnancy, while building muscles and flexibility specific to labor and burning enough calories to offset my very increased appetite.  Whether you get one of these or not, my overall advice is that working out during pregnancy really, really helps  it helped me stay more comfortable as I expanded and my center of gravity shifted, it helped me feel good about the changes that were happening to my body, and it helped prepare me for a relatively smooth and manageable labor and delivery (no medication).

Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: This was one of my favorites, and I think in the long run it really helped prepare my body for labor; it also helped me to relax, stretch, and feel good as I got bigger and bigger.  Some of the reviews here point out that it is not a very intense workout  thats true, but I felt like there was plenty of stretching and strengthening, and through much of my pregnancy high intensity was not what I was looking for  the goal of this video is not to increase athleticism, but to help the body adjust to pregnancy and prepare for labor.  Amira is a very encouraging coach, and much of the commentary is designed to be relaxing, informative, and comforting; I also appreciated that she looked like a real pregnant woman in the video, rather than a super fit, still skinny woman who just happened to have a bump.  The bonus material  interviews and some dance performances  was not all that appealing to me, but I liked Amiras intro statement about her own experience and the history of bellydance.  The interviews might be more interesting/helpful for someone who doesnt have sisters/girlfriends who have been through this before.

10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates: This was another favorite.  I really like the format, where you can choose how many of the 10-minute segments to do, and in what order, and I felt like the workouts were manageable and well-suited to pregnant bodies.  Towards the end of my pregnancy, I was doing the flexibility workout more than the others and often just one or two at a time, but for the first two trimesters, I would usually do three of the workouts at a time.  I was somewhat familiar with pilates already, but not an expert by any means, and I found the workouts easy to follow (with a little practice needed the first few times); I think this would be good for those new to pilates, and the format means that even people who are not used to working out can start off with a manageable amount and work up from there.  The instructor sometimes gives conflicting cues about breathing patterns, but generally she is clear, informative, and easy to follow.  Seeing someone well into her 3rd trimester doing these exercises was very inspiring.  Some of the workouts don't require any equipment, but some require light hand weights and/or pillows.

Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga: I didn't get this until near the end of my pregnancy, but the few times I did it made me wish I had it earlier.  The pace and level of difficulty are definitely geared towards beginners, and much of the emphasis is on toning and stretching in ways that are particularly geared towards pregnancy and labor (kegel exercises and hip stretches).  This is a very relaxing and slow-paced video  not a killer workout that will leave you sweating and panting.  There are modifications for each trimester, but with many of the moves, I found I could do the 1st trimester version and didn't need the modifications.  It did require some equipment: a yoga blanket (? Not sure what this is  I just used a regular blanket folded up), a strap (I used the belt from a bathrobe), and a yoga brick (this was needed for some of the later trimester modifications  I just skipped it).

Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1: I had read great reviews of this, but was disappointed and only used it a few times.  Basically, it was too strenuous for my pregnant self  the instructor is a world-class athlete and I guess this is the workout she had put together for herself during her pregnancy  nothing wrong with that, but her level of fitness and her fitness goals were just a little different from mine, and I really couldn't keep up.  That said, there were a few moves that I liked and did separately when I just needed something quick (like the labor squats).  I did like it that kegels were built into this.  If you feel you are up to it, it is an intense and thorough workout.  The final section, on preparing yourself mentally by doing an intense endurance exercise, seemed silly to me at the time, and it still seems silly now that Ive been through labor: 3 minutes of arm circles is difficult, but conquering this difficulty will not be enough to prepare you for making it through labor (which can be manageable if you are well-prepared!).

Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout: This video was ok, and definitely offers a thorough workout, but it was not my favorite.  It has three separate workouts, one for each trimester, and you can choose the complete version or an express version for each one (I think the complete version is just the express workout repeated a second time)  I almost always did the express version.  The 1st trimester workout was way too hard for me (I wanted to spend most of my 1st trimester sleeping), the 2nd trimester workout was just about right in terms of intensity, and the 3rd trimester workout was a little too light (for me).  The moves here are fairly traditional and will certainly tone major muscles groups without any frills; I would have appreciated more stretching.  There were a few pregnancy-specific moves that I often did separately (labor lunges, plie squats).  Summer Sanders and her trainer/sister-in-law are encouraging, but their chatter doesnt hold up well and starts to get annoying after watching it a few times.",1378080000,6,6440,4.737219730941704
3698789,4,B001MT0DMS,"The video is great to workout too but if you aren't use to movement with hips or dancing, it will be a little difficult. Overall it's fun, just don't strain yourself. I like the fact that you learn about midwives and traditional natural births which I plan on doing.",1377216000,,266,4.448979591836735
3698790,5,B001MT0DMS,"Perfect workout for labour!! I had terrible problems with pinching discs while I was pregnant, osteopath only helped while he was working my spine. He recommended I needed movement, but I couldn't walk more than a few steps without excruciating pain... Bellydancing brought immediate relief and was the best thing I could have done to improve bloodflow to my back and my baby, while also strengthening my birthing muscles. I had a wonderful labour and 'danced' the baby down. Having put in the hard miles beforehand was what made my labour infinitely shorter than what it would have been otherwise. Amira also includes a section for helping you through the actual labour, I put it on after my water broke and had my baby a few short hours later. Thank you Amira for a great workout and ensuring my baby had the best start in life :)",1376784000,2,832,4.666666666666667
3698791,5,B001MT0DMS,"I bought Amira's Belly Dance and Yoga for Pregnancy for the purpose of giving me exercises to stretch and strengthen labor muscles and to have relaxing exercises to do during active labor.  It did just that.  She slowly teaches each move, then allows for some minutes of practice to get a feel for each move.  While she does not include a continual routine to dance with, she teaches enough moves that you could make up a routine on your own.  I really loved the strengthening section and the moves for during active labor.  I'm excited to try them to help with relaxation, since I do not plan to use any pain medication.  She is calm, encouraging, and describes the moves expertly in ways anyone can understand.  It probably won't get your heart rate up too high, but it will give you exercises to practice for a coming labor.",1373328000,,827,4.547297297297297
3698792,4,B001MT0DMS,"Having had bellydance classes and tutors, I can say the middle portion - the dance portion, provides a nice breakdown and practice of basic moves. But, I'm not here to practice my bellydance right now. What I was actually looking for was a workout to strengthen the pelvic floor - so critical in pregnancy. This came recommended to me as such. But that's not what I found here. Instead, as I should have known, this workout is actually about strengthening glutes, thighs and upper chest.
Ugh! Great for post-pregnancy, I say.
The best benefit to this video? Hip circles help ALOT for easing hip stiffness and pelvic girdle pain - esp after getting up from sitting in a chair for a period of time. Wish I had done this pre-pregnancy to strengthen those areas!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PELVIC FLOOR?
Anyway, this video would have done well-
1 to provide an instructor who is more like the average joe in the yoga/stretching portion. WHO can stretch like that while pregnant? (In general the warm-up/stretching seems more appropriate as a stretch before a bellydance performance, and less like one the pregnant woman may need.)
2 Also, I found the yoga/stretching (warmup) part to disappoint. During the warm up - the speed of the poses (quite fast), the rigorous music, the visual stimulation provided by the outfit and backdrop to be completely counterproductive to slowing down the breath into deeper yoga breaths and bringing mindfulness to the experience.
3 Thirdly, the narration goes way beyond the actual workout moves. AND, its a bit unceasing. I wish there was a bit of silence now and again.
4 Finally, please be aware that some yoga experts caution against squats after a certain week in 3rd trimester. It can hasten the onset of labor. So, be careful with this workout weeks after 35.",1365465600,7,1788,4.808441558441558
3698793,5,B001MT0DMS,"(Edited review ^__^)

I did have a little trouble running this disk - have only been able to make it work once in the dvd player BUT it works fine in our PC computer and my mom's old laptop she handed down to us, so obviously I've had a chance to use it a lot more than when I wrote my first review. :)

After repeated use, I am pleased with this program and enjoy using it. The yoga and bellydance sections provide a gentle stretching/refreshing workout, and the strength section leaves my legs feeling worked but not sore the next day. I appreciate programs that include squatting, particularly prolonged squatting, and the history of why this position is good for opening the pelvis makes the time spent IN the squat go by faster. ;)

Overall, I would encourage adding this program to your repertoire of pregnancy/labor preparation.

(Currently 32 weeks pregnant)

***POST PREGNANCY REVIEW UPDATE***

I am still very happy I purchased and used this program. With my first pregnancy, I did not stretch or bother to exercise much and I paid a hefty (literally) price with both weight gain and a horrible recovery after an emergency csection. It was hard for me to even lift my daughter from the floor. I struggled every day and was sort of dreading the postpartum period with my second baby. First child, it was many months before even short jaunts outside with my daughter were comfortable.

Pregnant with my son, I was much more careful with my eating habits, and while I did try to stay active in other ways, I faithfully used this program and one other belly dance pregnancy workout - I did have to have a second csection but the recovery was...amazing! I'm telling you, I deep cleaned my entire house the first week postpartum.  I could even tell a difference in the hospital - first baby, picking something off the floor was not doable, I had to have a nurse or my husband help me. I feel like I can say that due to the squats and other exercises in this program, I was able to care for MYSELF, including picking up my own laundry from the floor - my body was strong and used to stretching frog-like to get to the floor, not weak and used to only bending forward like I used to be. I was up and walking faster, showering faster, even laying on my side faster (trust me, that was a feat not attainable until months after my first baby.) From the first week postpartum, I did not even have a problem picking my son up from laying on the floor - and he was a full pound heavier at birth. I would recommend this program to EVERYONE! I did not get the natural birth I was hoping for, but the body conditioning I was able to get from using this made the recovery so much easier, and I feel that even helped me bond faster with my son than with my daughter. Thanks, Amira!!",1361404800,,2773,4.4129158512720155
3698794,5,B001MT0DMS,"I loved this DVD. The soundtrack is top notch and Amira seems like a very genuine and sweet person. I would say that it is by far the most helpful pre-natal excercise DVD I have ever used. I have always been fairly strong, I am an avid cyclist; however this DVD focuses on the movements and stretches that will promote an optimal birth experience. Plus it leaves you feeling extremely relaxed :o) I even brought it to the hospital and used it while I was in labor, the nurses loved it. After two highly medicalized births (c-sections) which brought us our first two wonderful children, I had a unmedicated natural birth. I felt great after the birth and my husband and I had a wonderful time connecting with our beautiful baby boy.",1360627200,,731,4.545454545454546

While the Perfect Pregnancy Workout was more of a workout, it didn't have particular moves to help with labor, and I wasn't looking for a workout because I was doing other things like swimming and walking.  I wanted to learn basic moves to keep me limber and to help through labor.  Not only did it help with the pain, but I believe it also speeded up the labor.  I was at home for most of it, and then I had my little girl 3 hrs after arriving at the hospital--not what I was expecting with a first baby.

Keeping moving helped me gain only 17 pounds and manage my gestational diabetes.

Staying flexible meant I labored easily and even though this is my first baby, I'm 32, and was 230 pounds when I went into labor, I delivered my 8 lb 2 oz baby boy after only about an hour and a half of active labor, completely naturally.

And being active all the way up to delivery helped me recover quickly and lose not just my pregnancy weight, but an additional 17 pounds already.

3698801,5,B001MT0DMS,"This video is really several programs in one: the first, which most people will probably buy it for, is a gentle conditioning program for pregnant women with a strong dance component. The second is a reflection on childbirth from several different perspectives: Amira's as dancer, pregnant woman, and researcher, those of a midwife and a chiropractic doctor, and testimonials from six dancers who had children. These programs are also intertwined to some extent. I'll deal with the second program first.

_Amira's Belly Dance & Yoga For Pregnancy Prenatal Exercise for Childbirth Information_

The thrust of Amira's work is very much about recovering non-Western modes of bodily movement and preparation for childbirth. This can be seen in her introduction, and in little segments between the exercise sections of the workout. But what spoke to me most from this part of the video were the testimonials of dancers, who spoke about their own birth experiences. What came out of this was that pregnancy and birth are complicated, messy, and deeply individual. Some wound up having C-sections, some had tough pregnancies but were able to give birth vaginally, and every woman seemed to have a mix of joys and regrets. All thought they had benefited from their dance practice, but in different and nuanced ways -- a feeling of femininity, a strengthened bond with the baby, or better body awareness. I loved that this section of the video showed that becoming a mother is not one-size-fits-all deal, even if many of us have ideas about what the ""perfect"" childbirth might look like.

_Amira's Belly Dance & Yoga For Pregnancy Prenatal Exercise as Prenatal Workout_

The exercise section of the video contains five sections:

Yoga Warmup & Stretch
Strengthening
Belly Dance
Exercises During Labor
Cool Down and Stretch

This is quite a bit of material, and you will probably prefer just to do the warmup, cool down, and one of the sections in the middle on a normal day. I've tried it all except for the labor exercises, though these are mostly also bellydance movements, with the interesting addition of breathing practice that even women confined to bedrest can do.

The program is extremely careful, and very gentle. While you will stretch and strengthen your muscles, there are no jarring movements or even footwork. Everything is cued slowly and precisely. It means you should do this video on a day when you're not in a rush (you might be frustrated with the pace), but also that you're unlikely to injure or unduly strain yourself. Subtitles and inset videos will sometimes show modifications. And the program as a whole is a complete package -- every part of your body will be gently stretched or worked, though it won't feel like an intense workout. The best result was one I didn't even notice right away. After doing this video, I had almost three days without sciatica pain.

The ""Belly Dance"" section consists of basic movement instruction, but no choreographies. For women who are new to bellydance, Amira's instructions will be approachable. More experienced dancers will not find challenging moves or routines, but I think this section would be a great long warmup for a pregnant woman continuing her dance practice. (It doesn't have lots of lunges or extended shimmies that other warmups I know use, but which might be difficult or dangerous during pregnancy.) What I think is really valuable about this section, even for women who know how to do a chest circle and a maya, is that Amira's slow and careful repetition of the movements forces you to pay attention to your basics. I found myself really focusing on the fundamentals, striving to extend my range of motion, and working on doing basic movements in a beautiful way. It made me think that there could be a plus side to dancing when pregnant!

The summary? You will love this DVD if you want a full but gentle prenatal workout, if you want to luxuriate in movement that will support your pregnancy, and if you want to hear about other women's thoughts on and experiences of childbirth. You will not love it if you want a fast or sweaty workout, or if you do not want to hear about childbirth practices around the world (there are informational bits between the workout segments).",1325289600,19,4250,4.916317991631799
3698802,5,B001MT0DMS,"I've completed the entire workout (barring the Exercises During Labor section) several times now and still really enjoy this DVD--it's the first of my pregnancy DVDs I go to! Amira is a soothing instructor and the exercises are slow and gentle. I enjoy how Amira explains how particular moves are beneficial for your baby or your body during pregnancy.

Yoga warmup: Good meditation exercise and controlled breathing help you to relax and loosen up. I imagine this would be handy during early labor as well.
Strengthening Exercises: A short but challenging exercise that strengthens your thighs and glutes, especially if you haven't done many squats for a while. Ends with a great stretching pose that helps to open up the groin.
Pre-Natal Bellydance: Amira takes you through various moves, first focusing on hips, then the chest, then the arms. Amira explains and breaks down the moves well, and the pace is quite slow, so beginners shouldn't have trouble keeping up. Note though that she doesn't mirror her moves, so when she says to move to the right, she appears to move to the left onscreen.
Exercises During Labor: To be safe, I haven't tried these exercises myself, but they look handy.
Cool Down: This is a lovely and relaxing segment, and may help increase flexibility. Some gentle yoga poses are used at the end.
Extras: I personally didn't find these very useful, though some may be interested in various dancers' pregnancy stories.

Overall, the exercises gently increase the heart rate, while leaving you calm and relaxed. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those interested in being extremely fit throughout pregnancy as it seems too mild, but for strengthening and increasing flexibility in a calming environment, this is a very good buy.",1316822400,4,1752,5.017182130584192
3698803,4,B001MT0DMS,"I'm an experienced bellydancer and found the exercises to be a bit on the bland side.  However, I really enjoyed the explanations of types of bellydance moves to do and those to stay away from.  Also, the personal narratives of mother's birthing experiences were refreshing and nice to watch.  The camera and sound were far better than most bellydance DVDs and you could clearly see the moves and understand what was being portrayed.  I would recommend this DVD and would find it most beneficial for someone who has never danced but would like to start during pregnancy.  For experienced dancers, these moves could be added to your current routine/practice.",1313971200,4,657,4.990825688073395

Her stregnth moves gave me confidence in the delivery room and made me feel physically fit and confident while pregnant.

3698805,4,B001MT0DMS,"Having done belly dance for some years, I was looking for moves that would not endanger my unborn baby. Amira's Belly Dance & Yoga For Pregnancy Prenatal Exercise is a wonderful CD consisting of easy and soft exercises, that I imagine are good to follow and learn for beginners too. I liked the overview of the origins and benefits of belly dance in general and for pregancy in particular; I enjoyed the stretches and various belly dance moves for hips, arms and chest; and benefitted greatly from the specific exercises for labour, when the big moment finally arrived.

Even though the number of moves were limited (which was initially disappointing to me, who has some experience), I would rather be safe - which was after all what I had been looking for. The exercises are easy to follow, in speed as well as in explanation and example, from different angles where necessary. The background music is relaxing too.

I definitely recommend this DVD. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the limited number of moves, which may be justified for safety reasons, but a little disappointing for an advanced belly dancer.",1294444800,4,1121,4.803108808290156

I did like her insight on how the western world is the only place where women lay down to give birth and due to all the sitting and driving we do most of out muscles needed for childbirth are stiff.  This video aims at giving you more flexibility and preparing you for child birth which was great.

3698815,4,B001MT0DMS,"I have really been enjoying this DVD! It took me a while to find a belly dancing workout especially for pregnancy; in the meantime I tried out a few beginning belly dance DVDs that were not specifically for pregnancy and found most of them hard to follow. Amira does a very good job of breaking down the moves. The movements in themselves are simple, yet even after following the video twice I felt a huge difference in my hips and muscle tone.  That being said, I didn't think that the warm up segment was that great; I didn't feel especially warmed up after doing it, so what I do now is warm up with some of my other DVDs and then skip straight to the strengthening and belly dance sections. The labor exercise segment is also very helpful. However, I was not too impressed with the interviews. There is good information there, but if you already have any experience with (natural)birthing you will probably not hear anything that you didn't already know.

As a side note, I was at a sandwich shop with my 2 year old daughter the other night and she got up and started doing hip circles to the pop music that was playing there :D",1234310400,3,1132,4.411483253588517

In this video, Amira's obvious comfort with her body, her lovely pregnancy glow and her gently encouraging words offer a role model for women looking for an alternative to feeling fat and clumsy during pregnany.  Our world needs more images of beautiful mother goddesses celebrating their abundance!

The yoga stretches and strengthening sections are a really nice addition.  I do believe that yoga and belly dance are wonderfully complimentary to each other.

It is a really nice, safe, and do-able program, with very good instruction and a nice pace in which a woman can take her time and follow along.

The DVD is also packed with extras.  I loved the 2 beautiful performances by Amira, and the out-takes were fun!  While the interviews might be somewhat helpful to the pregnant women using the video, I felt they did not add much to the overall quality of the information offered.

Thanks to Amira for producing this DVD - it is an excellent addition to the world of prenatal exercise videos, and I will happily recommend it to pregnant women!

8321678,4,B001MT0DMS,"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Bellydance: (two stars)  This DVD was $25, and was by far my least favorite workout.  The moves are so simple and basic that I found it boring, and only did it a couple of times.  The workouts are both half an hour and are virtually identical, with only a few very minor changes.  Had there been a totally different workout for the ""level two"" I definitely would have given a better rating.  As it stands, I think throwing in that second workout was misleading, because it's pretty much the same thing.  The higher cost put my expectations higher, and the dvd simply did not deliver.
I used to work out regularly, but haven't since my first pregnancy (I didn't exercise at all then, because I was sick the whole pregnancy), and my daughter's birth.  We walk a lot, but that's pretty much been it (she is a little over two years old), so I am not some fitness guru or dance expert.  I only recommend this if your fitness level is zero, and you are already over six months pregnant before you decide to try a Prenatal workout.  If by the end of my pregnancy (I'm a little less than six months now) this is the only workout I can handle, I'll come back and up the rating.

Bellydance Prenatal Fitness with Naia: (four stars)  if all you are looking for is a quick thirty minute workout, this is a good pick.  The movements keep rolling along, and nothing is super complex, but there are great strengthening moves in here that will certainly help tone all the right muscles for labor and delivery.  There's not a ton of talking or any filler either; this DVD is a flat thirty minutes of focused exercising.  The segments get combined into a sort of choreographed dance, but some of the moves aren't all that ""dancey"" to me compared to other DVDs that I have.  Still, all in all I like this DVD, and choose it on days when I'm not up for a longer Prenatal workout.  It goes by quickly, and I don't get bored.
If you get impatient when you can't follow along with a workout immediately, skip this one.  She doesn't take a lot of time doing the moves super slowly.  Unless you are an experienced dancer, or have done tons of bellydancing, it will take you some practice to get parts of this workout down perfectly.  I'm still a tad clumsy at certain parts of it, but I could care less.  I keep it moving regardless of the ""quality"" of my dancing ability, and manage to enjoy myself.  Watch it once before trying it, and slow down parts that seem confusing.  You CAN get it over time.
The only thing I don't care for about this dvd is the bizarre counting.  She does an eight count, and her tone is odd and distracting.

Amira's Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: (four stars)  Ok, overall Amira put together a very thoughtful and effective Prenatal workout, however, over time a few things about this DVD grated on my nerves.  Maybe it's because I am six months pregnant now?  There are little snippets about the history of bellydancing and childbirth mixed in with the workout.  While these are interesting to watch a couple of times, it then becomes a minor irritation having to skip over them every time you want to work out.  I want to stay in my workout zone without being interrupted, and I felt all the history/ trivia snippets should have been combined into one segment that was completely separate from the workout.
Another thing that bugged me is that the cool down comes after a ""Labor Exercises"" segment that cannot be done by women 32 weeks and after.  It would have made more sense to put the cool down before this part, so that women 32 weeks and on don't have more to skip over.
Apart from that, I thought the workout was very well done, and incorporated many traditional belly dance moves (hips circles, rib slides, bicycle hips, infinity circles, etc.)  The whole workout is about eighty minutes long total, but is easy to break down if you don't have that much time.

Goddess Dance Prenatal Bellydance with Sera Solstice: (five stars, in spite of a few minor issues) This is the longest Prenatal workout that I have done, but I love the thoughtful extras like the standing and seated meditation segments.  Sera Solstice is a good teacher, easy to follow, and good at breaking down the moves.  This entire workout moves at a slow and soothing pace, and teaches you two different dance combos that are then combined at the end in a nice performance dance.
There is a six minute warm up, and then the first combo is 22 minutes, and the second combo is 31 minutes.  The two combos are combined afterwards in a six minute dance segment.  If you don't have time for both segments, do the warm up with combo one on some days, and then the warm up with combo two on others.  It's a great way of breaking down the dvd into multiple workouts, and your body will thank you.
After the dance portion of the workout there is a slow standing sort of dancy meditation to help you connect with your baby and body, and following that is a seated moving meditation section.  These are very relaxing, and definitely put me in a calm place.  Both of these sections combined take about 22 minutes.  I like to save them for right before bed time to help me sleep.
In total, I think if you go through and do the whole DVD it's roughy an hour and a half.
My only small complaint is that some of the moves are done for way too long.  The repetition of certain movements got to be dull to me, and I'd get impatient for the next one to come.  Not a huge deal, just an observation.
I will definitely recommend this teacher to other women though.

Other Bellydance DVDs that aren't specifically prenatal, but I am enjoying them while pregnant:

(Note: vigorous hip shimmies and fast turns aren't recommended at 28 weeks and after.  SLOW it down, and be mindful)

Foundations of Belly Dance with Sera Solstice: I can still do most of this at six months pregnant, and I love the combinations.  I slow down the sections with shimmies (chapter five and chapter six which take up about 17 minutes total), or sometimes just do my own thing while they play.  Eighty minutes total.  This has my all time favorite warm up and moving meditation with stretches (that part alone is 30 minutes, and I'm loving it while pregnant)

Bellydance East Coast Tribal with Sera Solstice: What can I say, I'm a fan of her teaching.  I did this workout for the first time today, and had no problems with any of the movements. (Not that I can do them all well, mind you...) the Twenty minute warmup is great, and then ten minutes of drills, all totally doable during pregnancy.  Following that is a seven minute dance routine that is fairly slow paced, and I still have no issues with it even with my giant baby belly.  For some reason the entire dance segment comes before the instruction of each combo instead of after, and that's weird, but it's a good workout.  Don't worry, she DOES show you how to do all the stuff in the dance routine.

Luscious, Sensual Goddess, and Love Potion Bellydance Workout with Neon (three separate DVDs):  These may be a bit harder for some to follow, but I still consider myself a beginner, and I'm enjoying these workouts while pregnant just to keep some variety.  Love Potion is the most difficult one for me to follow, because I'm not spectacular at footwork, but I still pop it in and give it my all.  Luscious is my favorite of the three, but I enjoy the other two as well.

This has to be the longest review I have ever written, but I started bellydancing at fourteen weeks of my pregnancy, and it has been so empowering for me!!!  I'm working out four times a week (along with plenty of walking), and feel like I'm in better shape than I was right before I got pregnant.

The instructions are easy to follow but be warned, stretch before hand and take your time!

I suggest starting out in the early second-trimester to build strength. I waited until I was about 35 weeks along to start exercising. 5 minutes into one of the dances my thighs were on fire and I couldn't get up from a kneeling position!

It's not a work out in the way western culture views it but, I think these particular movements are more important for pregnancy than some of the other videos I've bought for prenatal exercise. Push ups and sit ups are great and all but they don't prepare your body for birth.",1437868800,,574,4.528846153846154
