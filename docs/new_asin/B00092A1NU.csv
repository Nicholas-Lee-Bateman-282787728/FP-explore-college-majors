8056634,4,B00092A1NU,"Kazuki is wizard, but he can only use his magic 8 times before it kills him. Some of the most powerful magic families in the country find out about his dormant power and send their daughters to get his genes. That's pretty much the story.

This anime isn't very deep, but it's got some really neat characters and good animation. The soundtrack is all right too. Even though the story is pretty regular there are a few touching moments, it also delivers plenty of comedy too. I'm not gonna lie and say it's one of the best animes I've seen; but I'm glad I did see it. It's pretty enjoyable. Maybe check it out on youtube or netflix to see what you think.",1354147200,,653,4.308943089430894

8056636,5,B00092A1NU,"Well, to begin with a few words about the storyline (Just keep in mind that the storyline refers to the entire series and therefore SPOILERS will be included!!!)

If you are looking for Mechas like FMP or Evangelion, a deep emotional like Mirage of Blaze or The Last Exile and so many others, than you should skip this one.

If one the other hand, you are looking for something like Oh! My Goddess, a harem anime, romantic and action comedy etc. than you are definitely in the right place.

The story unfolds in a world similar to the ones we already know with the difference that many people are able to use magic and werewolves, ghosts and so forth is something that people are accustomed with. The place: A High-School that consists of students that are able to use magic. The catch: Each student has a specific number of times that can use his or her magic and if used up than will turn into dust (basically, die).

The story resolves around our main protagonist, Kazuki, who is the typical looser guy (at least at the beginning, as it usually happens to the harem animes) but is the descendant of the most powerful magicians, meaning that his son will become the strongest magician ever; but has two main `problems': 1. Can use his magic only 8 times (which proofs to be super strong) and b. all females of the high-school will try to get his genes which will create the entire comedy!

Then we have the other three main female protagonists: Yuuna, who claims that she is his wife and lives together with him, Rin who is a samurai girls (and at the beginning would prefer to kill him) and Kuriki, the super hottie and super rich girl who would like to seduce him.

Apart from it, the story will mainly resolve around these four protagonists, the relationships they will create, the adventures they will encounter (they will have to deal against a ghost-hunter when Kazuki will turn into a ghost for a while) and of course what choice Kazuki will make...In addition, you will be introduced to various other characters who will influence the outcome of the story as well.

Last but not least, Kazuki has a good heart and will try to help the others in his own expense and everything will depend on a promise he made when he was very young (or should I sea, two promises ;-) ).

As for the animation: It is good, compare it to the one of Oh! My Goddess and you will have a very good picture.

The music is good, starts with a nice pop/rock song and ends with a ballad.

The dub, is good done as well; but to be honest as well, I have seen better dubs as well but still it is a good one.

As for the extras, it has the typical stuff: Not credit opening/ending, trailers etc.

As for the storyline: It is very good, has a good character development, solid and has a few twists in it (but we also should keep in mind that we compare it for its genre as it is).

To the most `interesting' question: Buying it or not? To begin with, the price is the typical one that you most probably will find out there, therefore, having watched the entire series I can recommend the shows so that you can have a different and funny magic/romantic/comedy in your collection.

I hope that I could help you with this review :-)",1156896000,4,3208,4.39695945945946
8056637,4,B00092A1NU,"Rin, the tough as nails samurai girl of Aoi Academy comes to the forefront in this second volume of a very funny series. In the first episode she tries to master the art of preparing a school lunch for her crush on a fellow student who's transferring. She's never been able to work up the nerve to speak to him so it's up to Kazuki and the girls to give her some cooking training. Even though she might slice them up with her katana!

The second episode puts her in an even more comedic situation as she, Yuna, and Kurika all vie to look the best when they find out Kazuki's parents are coming to visit. A scene where Rin tries to perfect a polite smile is priceless. A possible new rival arrives in the form of Chihaya Yamase, a childhood friend of Kazuki as she asks Kazuki's class to join hers in putting on a festival play. Finally, the whole gang tries to catch a kid that has stolen a piece of stolen jewelry from the biggest jerk in the school, Nakamuro.

This installment was very funny. Rin especially shined and was involved in the best comedy because her personality is so opposed to such things. I give her an ""A"" for trying. The girls of the show never become annoying as is so common in shows like this. They're always funny, even the super-cute Yuna who can get pretty violent at times. The big busted Kuriko, who supposedly has everything, is learning that there's more to life than material possessions. And then there's Kazuki who you can't help but like because he gives without thinking about a reward. He's just a caring person. Great show.",1133222400,3,1561,4.435540069686411
8056638,5,B00092A1NU,"First off i started to collect this series because of the way people described it in their reviews. Turns out this is one of my favorite animes of all time.

  This dvd starts with Rin having a crush with this boy who is the head of the biology club. The problem is that he seems to be leaving the school and so Rin wants to do something nice for him before he leaves. Lets just say Rin isn't much of a cook...enough said.

  The second episode brings up the topic of Kazuki's parents and all of the girls are going wild. All of them believe that they have to make a good impression if they are to get Kazuki's genes so each of them takes their own time and prepares dishes and are ready to welcome Kazuki's parents. There was just one problem.....but im not gonna say.

  The third episode is about the aoi campus holding a festival and Kazuki's class can't seem to choose a role in this festival. The dvd introduces a new character and she seems to be Kazuki's childhood friend. They both take part in this play, but I won't say anything that will spoil it.

  The last episode begins with a boy trying to steal nakamuro's jewelry. Now the first thing that might come to your mind is ""why in the world does he even have jewelry?"" Kazuki's power maybe amazing, but exactly how many more times does he exactly have left?

  Overall if you enjoyed animes like: love hina, inuyasha, d.n.angel, or tenchi muyo then you will absolutely adore this series!!!!!!",1123804800,3,1455,4.397003745318352
8056639,5,B00092A1NU,"This series is good, not the greatest since i keep cringing each time i hear about people turning to ash when they run out of magic, definitly sucks... But the plot is so good and each story is so good at stand alone that i can hold out for the next volume... maybe not :)",1123632000,3,272,3.963636363636364
