8741163,4,B0182W7KJ6,"So far I've only watched the story of ""Abraham"" but I enjoyed it.  I think it's very well done... the acting, setting, costumes etc. (even the hair & makeup).  It seems, to me, to be an authentic portrayal of the story. It is quite long but I'd rather watch something that may be a little too long than something that was too short due to time constraints.  I'm looking forward to watching the other three stories. Some of the scenes however may NOT be suitable for children (may be ""disturbing"").",1514592000,,497,4.5

8741166,5,B0182W7KJ6,"Excellent!!  Nicely portrayed, with very good actors.  I especially like Joseph, one of my favorite stories.  And Moses was wonderful as well.  Ben Kingsley is in both Joseph and the lead role in Moses and does a excellent job.  Looking forward to watching other 2 movies.  Great purchase!",1483920000,,289,4.916666666666667

The cast includes such recognizable names as Ben Kingsley, Richard Harris, Barbara Hershey, Sean Bean, Lesley Ann Warren and Christopher Lee. The costumes are accurate; the sets breath-taking and expansive. Each movie follows the Biblical narrative. Watching the entire set was something to look forward to. The Emmy-winning Miniseries, Joseph, one wed not been privileged to see before, was particularly exceptional.

My wife and I were excited to sit down and watch them one night after another. Now we look forward to seeing them again and sharing them with youngsters who visit. What an exciting way to introduce (or re-introduce) these Bible stories in an entertaining and enlightening way.

We highly recommend this 4-Movie Collection.",1471737600,2,894,5.244755244755245
8741168,2,B0182W7KJ6,"I really wanted to enjoy this DVD Set.  I am always on the search for family friendly entertainment, and was interested in watching this, especially seeing that it was ""Family Approved"" bearing The Dove Foundation symbol.

However, I am not sure that conservative families, especially those with younger watchers, are going to be very happy with The Dove Foundation.  I was a bit caught off guard by the content in these.

There is swearing and sensuality in the Jacob DVD.  Jacob says ""D**n--, and D**n it"", and there is also a bedroom tent scene between him and his first wife Leah.  Granted, they are married, and its their first morning waking up as husband and wife.  However, while no skin is really showing, there is no doubt as to what is taking place, and close ups are shown of them passionately kissing.

What may be offensive to some, may be very mild for others, but I wanted to provide an honest, detailed review so families with small children wouldn't pop these in and leave the room, because they are ""Dove"" family approved.

I would not consider this suitable for younger viewers, but more along the lines of PG-13.  Each family will have to decide for themselves but I STRONGLY encourage parents to preview this series first.

There is a lot of violence, some violent treatment of animals, killing of people, sacrifice and so forth.  And while all of that is biblical because that certainly happened, it could be potentially traumatic if your little one is sensitive to things like this.

I personally didn't enjoy seeing the treatment of some of the animals as these were being filmed.  In one of the movies, a dog is violently yanked by a rope around the neck, and pulled away from the middle of a gathering. I believe you can hear the dog yelp.  That bothered me as an adult, so small children may be upset by it as well.

Unfortunately, the sound quality is also bad.  I tested out other DVD's in my player, and so I know it wasn't my equipment.  The sound is muffled at times, and then the background music drowns out conversation in some places.  The sound quality is very poor and was annoying.

Abraham starts off very slow, and is not 100% accurate when compared to the Bible.  It was out of sequence and hard to follow.  We couldn't really tell what was going on for a long time.  Had I not of agreed to watch these for a review, I would have given up.

Jacob was also hard to follow and not accurate, based on the scriptures.  The first time viewers see Leah with a baby, she calls him Judah.  But according to the Bible, Judah was not her first born.  Judah was actually the fourth, so its a little confusing.

I eventually stopped watching these, because they were off putting to me. I'm not sure if The Dove Foundation actually watched all of these, but more conservative families are probably going to be caught off guard like I was, if they don't read any reviews or personally screen these before watching them as a family.",1466294400,2,2959,4.542533081285444
