3938599,4,B002JT6A7M,"Whimsical, sentimental, colorful, and both funny and awkward, THE BROTHERS BLOOM is original in its context and characters even if the plot itself is relatively predictable. The tale of two brothers who learn at an early age their skill at pulling off confidence schemes (all in the film's well designed and funny first 10 minutes). They continue to run cons into their early thirties when Bloom (Brody), the younger of the two, is faced with a bit of a quarter-life-crisis and decides to quit conning alongside his older brother Stephen (Mark Ruffalo). Of course he returns on the premise of helping Stephen carry off 'one last job,' the most glaringly cliched element in the entire film. All is forgiven however as the cast of characters unfolds, and director Rian Johnson rolls out more story arc. We meet Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi), a semi-mute Asian woman with a penchant for blowing things to pieces and Penelope Stamp (Rachel Weisz), a billionaire heiress & collector of strange hobbies. Weisz is convincingly awkward, funny, intelligent, and ultimately lovable. Weisz, Brody, and Ruffalo give good performances but are still all outclassed by Rinko Kikuchi's portrayal of Bang Bang. She communicates much with few to no words. She is the master of the subtle facial expression and she singlehandedly raised this film from 3 stars to 4 for this viewer.

Rian Johnson's directorial style resembles Wes Anderson's, but with more of a penchant for sweetness. THE BROTHERS BLOOM is littered with sentimental twists, moments, and visuals. Johnson's craft is still developing, with his this, his sophomore effort, falling slightly short of his wonderful first film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>. The gentle goodnaturedness of the film is surprisingly refreshing in a movie marketplace littered with grit, angst, and cynicism. I think this is why the film scored so poorly with paid reviewers; they were too afraid of seeming soft by liking the movie and being branded as 'sentimental.' The film has a sweetness to it that may turn off some viewers, but to me is was a nice change of pace from the typical Hollywood offering.

As the film progresses it does a decent enough job of not revealing too much and providing the viewer a plausible suspension of disbelief. There are a few moments that don't ring true (the first encounter with Diamond Dog at the bar for example--actually I didn't like the Diamond Dog character at all and thought he was superfluous to the plot and movie as a whole) but they are few and far between. My strongest criticism of the film is that Johnson, Brody, and the rest of the cast know how clever certain elements of the film are, and they let the audience know that they know. Clever is fine, but I don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that the movie is oh so smart. Another confusing plot element is Penelope's seeming inability to drive a sports car--this from a woman who has mastered more than a few difficult hobbies including pinhole photography and martial arts!

Overall this is a very enjoyable movie if you appreciate warmth in film. It's sentimental. It's bright and fun and intelligent. Viewers who prefer their cinema to be dark and brooding should probably skip this one and watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River/dp/B0001ZX0OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;instead.

4/5 Stars. Well worth renting or even owning.",1255132800,,3923,5.805555555555555
3938600,4,B002JT6A7M,"Brothers Bloom has been a good Blu with some fun writing that has played well for customers. It has been out for three months now but it has still maintained a solid sale/rental run through word-of-mouth.

The film follows a triumvirate of cons (Ruffalo, Brody and the wonderfully mute Kikuchi - admittedly her first line at the one hour mark is priceless) swindling their way around the world performing wonderful acts of trickery and thievery. They choose one last mark in that of getting some money out of a rich woman played quite well by Weisz. The plot twists, turns and cons until the last scene and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. It had humor, wit, love, treachery, great landscapes and architecture all wound into a fun story.

The Blu looked beautiful throughout, and even the CGI scenes came across without too much fault. There are plenty of clear day and solid night shots to test the color palette and contrasts. The DTS sounded wonderful, including a good mix on the narration element, shooting scenes and explosions. The supplements are thorough and include:
* 12:30 minutes of Sketch to Celluloid, a three part split screen showing of the process from storyboard to finished product, has a brief director's commentary.
* 15:34 minute segment on the making of, a great non-narrated/non-interviewed behind the scenes divided up into the different filming locations by country. Loved it - I have always liked these kinds of docus.
* 3:14 minute Image Gallery, another similar sketch to film imagery that self rotates.
* 33 minutes of deleted scenes with optional director's commentary. Wow. I sat through these twice as I did not take the director's advice (he intros the scenes with the request that you turn on his commentary before watching them - I did not). There were so many that I felt were wrongfully cut, but I suppose the film felt long enough as it was. Great scenes though.

Overall - an outstanding Blu package well worth the money if you are fan of any of these cast members. It has caught the attention of every customer walking by the screenings, hope you enjoy.",1254009600,,2100,4.811634349030471
3938601,5,B002JT6A7M,"For all people who love the beauty of awkwardness and a wonderful dialogue between characters, this movie is for you. The humor and charm of the first half of the film is only made more enjoyable by the heartfelt latter half. Enchanting performances by all particularly the short appearances of The Brothers in their youth, though Brody, Weiss, Ruffalo, and Kikuchi all deserve acclaim.
  For some reason movie critics tanked this gem, but the people who went to see it tend toward rave review. Perhaps the critics weren't paid for a positive opinion in a timely manner, or maybe they just can't let themselves enjoy a piece of cinema that isn't some crappy Hollywood remake. See with friends, and I hope you enjoy it as I did.",1249430400,30,727,4.716535433070866
3938602,3,B002JT6A7M,"Whether you love or hate the movies of Wes Anderson, you have to admit that his films have a style and tone that is nearly unmistakable (I happen to love his films).  His movies have a combination of quirky humor, odd and melancholy characters, and frequently unexpected sad twists.  The camera work is almost deliberately obtrusive, as though he wants you to be very aware that you're looking at people...rather than JOINING them.  I find his tone of sadness and intelligent, cynical humor to be engaging...but I also recognize that it leaves a lot of people cold.

I now have a better understanding of that side of Anderson after seeing THE BROTHERS BLOOM (not directed by Anderson).  Writer/director Rian Johnson (BRICK...also stylistically pushy) has crafted a movie with the morose characters and amusing plot leading to some heartbreak with which Anderson has lately been identified.  His characters dress in unorthodox manners and live in a world disconnected from what we think of as familiar.  But the film has a loose, flabby feel and sometimes when it wants to indulge in ""feelings"" it forgets to keep moving.  There are certainly moments of fun, particularly early on...but in the end, it was an unsatisfying journey.

Stephen (the elder) and his brother Bloom (the younger) spend their childhoods drifting from one foster home to another.  These are smart boys, but eager to put their smarts to less than honest works.  While Bloom would clearly like to just be a nice, shy boy leading a normal if bookish life...Stephen has a reckless energy (and a keen desire to make his brother something more) and uses this intelligence to devise elaborate con games.  Bloom is reluctant, but as it turns out, very good.  Stephen is the scriptwriter and supporting actor, but Bloom is always the star.

They grow up and eventually in their late 30's they grow apart.  Or rather, Bloom dumps his brother to go live a solitary, sad life, thinking about all the people whose emotions he's manipulated in order to take their money.  Naturally, Stephen finds him and sets up the story of ""one last con.""  Bloom reluctantly agrees.  They are going to steal millions from lonely heiress Penelope (Rachel Weisz)...but it turns out not to be so easy, because Penelope is eager to get involved in shenanigans herself.  As they travel the world, it's not always clear who is double crossing whom, nor is it clear who is feeling what for whom.  We think, from time to time, that Bloom is REALLY falling for Penelope...or he might be a really good actor.

I won't hint at more of the plot, but I will say that the con itself was not very elaborate or satisfying.  I had expected the film to have a more THE STING-like complexity...but really the events play out in a very linear fashion that did not leave me impressed.  Even the ""twist"" ending was nothing terribly surprising.  I realized then, that writer/director Johnson had more on his mind than the plot...he was doing a character study.  However, he mostly showed us behaviors and nothing very deep about the inner workings of the characters.

Bloom (Adrien Brody...doing his best ""sad sack"") is clearly a man in turmoil over his lifestyle.  That was the one emotion I could really connect to and understand.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot else to him.  In one scene, he steals an apple and makes an attempt to escape, and we see the joy on his face at the delight of running through beautiful fields of flowers with angry folks chasing him.  It was a return to the simpler times of his childhood...and a lovely scene.  One of too few.  Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) is much more of a cipher.  He's the big brother.  He's the schemer who can't imagine any other life than that of a con artist.  He doesn't seem to get how his brother feels or to feel guilty about what he does...yet apparently he is a keen observer of human behavior.  Ruffalo does fine in the role, but the script has truly relegated him to the background much of the time.  Weisz is a delightful oddball.  Not a convincing ""real life"" person...but she has an expressive face and a bumbling physicality that was surprising coming from her.  I enjoyed her performance, even as I realized that I wasn't actually terribly interested in Penelope.  I think I was enjoying Weisz having a lark more than I was enjoying her creating a flesh and blood character.

Stephen and Bloom (it's never explained why the film is called THE BROTHERS BLOOM...doesn't that imply this is their last name?  Perhaps Bloom has never gone by his first name?  Who knows?) are assisted in their cons by  Bang Bang, a Japanese explosives expert who hardly makes a sound.  She's played with great style by Rinko Kikuchi (BABEL), but again, is not for one second a believable person...she's an amusing idea and Kikuchi is having a blast playing her.

The film frequently turns ""serious"" and then wants to be lighthearted again.  What it doesn't seem to understand is that sometimes BOTH tones can exist in the same scene.  Something Anderson does well, and something Johnson can't manage.

The film is also shot in a very dark, muted palette.  The main characters wear mostly black, white and gray.  The cities around them (Montenegro, Prague, etc.) all are the same muddy color, and the sky always looks like rain is just around the corner.  It was, to be blunt, a somewhat ugly film to look at.  For one extended period, Penelope finally wears some color, but it's a horrid orange serape sort of thing that makes Weisz look like a big ochre block with a head.  I can appreciate muted palette's and such...but all the efforts at light-hearted fun have most of the fun leached from them by the dark atmosphere.

THE BROTHERS BLOOM did have its sporadic moments of fun.  Weisz works really hard and Brody & Ruffalo are always pleasant to watch.  But I just felt the film was trying far too hard and missing the mark too often to get a recommendation from me.  A disappointment.",1246665600,2,5961,4.732038834951457
3938603,4,B002JT6A7M,"Rian Johnson created a great modern day noir film (which was also his debut as a director) with Brick that was really enjoyable. When the word about The Brothers Bloom started making its rounds, it immediately reeled me in. Johnson's style in The Brothers Bloom seems to almost mimic Wes Anderson's at times as several scenes (especially the first ten minutes or so) have a similar feel that seem to be shot in the same way you'd see in an Anderson film. The film also has a Kiss Kiss Bang Bang feel to it with how colorful every shot is. The tone was similar in both films as they both had humor as an underlying tone amongst a dramatic adventure revolving around crime. This film is just a real pleasure to look at. The cinematography seems to tell a story all on its own as every shot seems to be done in a unique way and everything is so vividly colorful.

Every factor of the film is strong. The story isn't entirely original as we've all heard con men stories before, but the way the story unfolds and the development of the characters involved makes it a new experience. The dialogue is also top notch. Nothing stuck out as being cheesy or hokey. Every line spoken was either witty, charming, or something you'd expect to hear in everyday conversation. So it was realistic and natural. The entire cast has to be the film's strongest point though. There doesn't really seem to be a character that's wasted or isn't used to their full potential. Rachel Weisz does steal the show though. Her character is so charismatic, outgoing, and eccentric that she just steals every scene she's a part of.

The Brothers Bloom is one of the best films to be released this year, which is a shame since it seems to have a limited release. It offers something for everybody looking for a good time at the movies whether it's an adventure that will take them around the world, romance between two of the central characters, an oddball character that's great comedic relief, the development of both brothers as characters as their crime of swindling people as con men causes drama, and even plenty of explosions to satisfy the action junkie. The conclusion of the film is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as well. The Brothers Bloom will probably be overlooked by the many assured blockbusters coming out this summer, but it comes highly recommended from me and should be on everyone's must see list.",1245196800,4,2391,4.650118203309693
3938604,4,B002JT6A7M,"If there's anything I've come to expect from films about con artists, it's that the audience is going to be conned along with the characters. That's just the way it works. Because I know this to be true, con artist movies tend to impress me less and less as the years go by; I may not know exactly how I'll be tricked, but I do know that a trick is coming. I therefore can't trust anything--not the characters, not the plot, and certainly not the visuals. So it's not surprising that I kept my guard up watching ""The Brothers Bloom,"" which gets a huge payoff from continuously misdirecting the audience to the point where nothing seems credible anymore. Strangely enough, this isn't that much of a problem in the grand scheme of things. What this movie lacks in reliability is made up for through quirky performances and a generous helping of humor.

The title is actually a bit of a misnomer, seeing as Bloom is not the brothers' family name. It's actually the first name of the younger brother, played as an adult by Adrien Brody. The older brother, played as an adult by Mark Ruffalo, is named Stephen. As children dressed in black suits and hats, they were continuously sent from one foster home to another. It's during this period that Stephen, ever the observant and thinking-ahead type, plans his first con. Bloom goes along with it, but it quickly becomes apparent that he will only be a character in one of Stephen's stories. In other words, Bloom is forced to be only what his brother wants him to be.

The thing is, he doesn't completely come to terms with how he feels until twenty-five years later, when they both pull of an elaborate con in Berlin. Bloom finally decides he has had enough and runs off to Montenegro. Somehow, Stephen tracks him down three months later and talks him into one last con, which begins in New Jersey. Here enters an heiress named Penelope (Rachel Weisz), a super wealthy recluse who lives alone in a sprawling mansion that seems inspired by a gothic novel from the nineteenth century. The brothers' plan: Pose as art dealers to steal her family's liquid assets. What no one counts on is just how knowledgeable she is for someone so cut off from the world. As she tells Bloom, she collects hobbies; she sees something she likes, reads all about it, and just jumps right into doing it. A wonderful montage shows a wide range of hobbies, from acrobatics to juggling chainsaws to playing a variety of instruments to installing a surveillance camera in a hollowed-out watermelon. The only thing she's not good at is driving.

On a boat trip to Greece, she's approached by a Belgian man known only as the Curator (Robbie Coltrane), who mysteriously warns Penelope that Bloom and Stephen are actually art smugglers. This excites Penelope in a way she's never been excited before, and by the time they arrive in Greece, she decides to become a smuggler. She then travels to Prague with the brothers to steal a rare book hidden somewhere within the city. Little do the brothers realize that they will soon reunite with Diamond Dog (Maximilian Schell), the man who taught them the tricks of the trade before they all had a falling out.

This is by no means the sum of the plot, but I think it's best if I stop describing it at this point. As I already said, nothing about con artist films can be trusted. Everything that happens seems to be a piece of a gigantic scheme, only to go in an entirely different direction. Partly, it has to do with the fact that Penelope doesn't know Bloom and Stephen's real intentions. Or does she? She may not have much experience with people. She may have been unfairly quarantined as a child for allergies she never actually had. She may find the combination of alcohol and a lightning storm orgasmic. But that doesn't mean she isn't observant. A fascinating scene has her telling Bloom about herself as she performs an amazing sleight-of-hand card trick; she shuffles the deck so precisely that she's able to produce the aces for each suit, and she does this multiple times. Who else but a well-read observer could pull off something so astounding?

Penelope is such a wonderful eccentric, the kind of person who wants to try everything at least once. She wants to live life as if it were an adventure story, which is actually disheartening to Bloom since a story is the very thing he's trying to escape from. He also doesn't want to hurt Penelope because--you guessed it--he falls in love with her. Stephen is quick to remind him that love and conning don't mix.

I greatly enjoyed Weisz's performance. She allowed Penelope to be something more than the odd girl with all the strange hobbies. I also enjoyed Rinko Kikuchi as the brothers' sidekick, Bang Bang, a woman who possesses the uncanny ability to appear and disappear in the blink of an eye. She so rarely speaks; she mostly just stands next to either Bloom or Stephen, doing mundane but nonetheless interesting things with various objects. She can also make explosives, some big, some small. No one can say where she came from or why she teamed with the brothers. She's just ... there. As for Rufallo and Brody, they do just fine given the intentionally misleading nature of the plot. That's also a bit of a problem--I probably would have liked them better if I had trusted the story. But since I knew from the start that ""The Brothers Bloom"" was about con artists, there was no trust for me to spare.",1244073600,,5429,4.644120707596254

3938606,2,B002JT6A7M,"I really like all three of the actors in this movie, but after the initial scenes where the brothers were children, I just couldn't get into it.  I'm a fan of slow movies, but this one was just way too slow to be a romance, comedy, or suspense film.  So I don't know what it was.  The adult characters were so obtuse that I ended up not caring about what happened or to whom, not that much happened.  In fact, when things did happen they were so disjointed that the movie felt really jumpy, which left the viewer feeling disconnected with the plot, characters, everything.

Kikuchi's contribution is a tour de force in what appeared to me as the use of the Psychological Gesture, Kabuki, Kygen, and Noh (without the masks) all wrapped up into one. I wasn't really tracking or counting, and Kikuchi was probably in about 50% of the scenes, if not more, and had maybe 3 lines, yet communicated equally on par with her co-leading cast. Probably more of a four and a half star film as I do not think it flawless, but certainly good enough to deserve five stars over four.",1472256000,2,766,4.639705882352941

3938663,1,B002JT6A7M,"This movie had so much potential!  The first 70% was interesting, witty, smart, and funny...and then it ran off the rails more than any other movie that I've ever seen.  Truly, it felt like a brilliant screenwriter was achieving his greatest movie yet, only to be fired and replaced by a 10 year old kid who wrote out a terrible conclusion without ever reading the preceding script---that's how disjointed and strange the ending seemed to be!  I honestly waited through the credits because I thought that there would be a few more scenes spliced in with there in order to actually wrap up the story...but, no luck.

(No spoilers).  As stated in the summary, the movie follows two of the greatest con artists on their last con....and, the entire movie sets them up as amazing professionals who are capable of such storytelling and insight into others' psyche that they can make any scenario successful (and, as with other great movies involving heart-warming thieves, even when everything looks problematic, there is a great twist at the end to make the con work out).  Ok, great.  The majority of the movie is very enjoyable and different and then...disaster.

Characters who seemed to play a major role in the beginning disappeared without explanation.  Minor characters (who were not really explained) became major ones without reason or logic.  Some really interesting events hinting at bigger/critical storylines were dropped immediately.  Characters went against everything in their nature from the entire rest of the movie.  And, finally, the ending just didn't make sense...it was dumb, it didn't fit with the rest of the story, and it seemed totally irrational.  Not every story has to end in rainbows and unicorns, but this didn't even ""go"" with the rest of the movie.

In short, everything awesome about the movie was TOTALLY and utterly overshadowed by the worst, ill-fitting ending that I've ever seen.  I was actually angry about it...so much good stuff at the beginning, ruined by something incomprehensible at the end.  Did they run out of money and have to film the last 30% in 24 hrs?  Did all the actors quit and the ending had to be created from random scenes/dialogue from outtakes?  I don't know...but I'm resentful for the waste of time AND for the failure of an otherwise great plot.",1471132800,3,2306,4.930051813471502

I don't remember it when it came out, and probably never would have seen it had Rian Johnson not been the director and was rather interested in seeing his filmography, and I have to say that although this is easily the least like his other projects, it is also possibly his best work so far.  It is a bit more whimsical than I would have expected, but there is a darkness to it as well, though maybe not on the surface, but more importantly it is about the choices that we make in life to hold onto the bad or to start.  It is a heist movie like none I have ever seen, and while it does have a few twists and turns, this one very much tells you everything that you need to know and lets the journey of why lighten your day.

3938796,5,B002JT6A7M,"This is an unfailingly delightful and rewarding film.. I was absolutely charmed by it,  enjoyed its humor greatly and was very impressed with its creative use of settings. However, all of these statements suggest a light-hearted, frivolous, even superficial experience. Wrong, very wrong. This is a profound account of a dysfunctional but co-dependent brother+brother relationship.
This film probes deeply into what can go wrong when the love is strong but the liking is almost non-existent. Many of the scenes are whimsical and the whimsy is deftly handled, but when issues become serious, the film rises effortlessly to seriousness. The performances of the three principal players are incandescent, with Mark Ruffalo especially convincing. This is character-driven cinema at its very best - and rewarding. One other element that I really, really enjoyed and it is one of the most unusual aspects of any film in my memory, that is, many scenes are filmed in such a way that the setting COULD BE the nineteenth century. It's uncanny. I don't why this was done, but I loved the sheer virtuosity of it. Just another element of this film's wonder!",1419897600,5,1144,5.117647058823529

3938826,2,B002JT6A7M,"I expected a light hearted comedy about a pair of brothers who were con artists, and that is what this movie represents, but only in part. It also has a slightly serious side, with some real emotion and sadness. The lack of morality that underlies the entire premise of the movie bothered me, however. This is true of many movies about the (somewhat) bad guys who are supposed to be the good guys. You have to be willing to pretend that the bad things they do don't matter. The characters build their lives on lies, which makes it harder to believe anything they say. It also makes it harder to sympathize with them. Once you do that, a friend assured me, the movie becomes very entertaining.

I did not reach that oblivious place. My problem is not with the nature of the characters, for many great stories are built on flawed characters. My problem was with the nature of the screenwriters, who want you to accept the lies as just another lifestyle choice.

This is a professional production, with excellent acting, plotting and filming. The plot is complex, with lots of unknowns, revelations and head scratching on the part of the viewer. In the end there is some ambiguity. If you watch the movie a second time, you will understand more, but there is lots of room for discussion and disagreement. This could have been a great movie.",1364083200,2,1337,4.61344537815126

Just about everything in this film was inspired and delightful.

Two foster brothers have a knack for the long con.  One brother dreams up ever more elaborate cons while the other simply dreams of an ""unwritten life.""  The next (and last, of course) mark is Penelope -- a lonely recluse who collects hobbies and doesn't know that what she really wants is adventure.  When the brothers show up and give her a glimpse of the fun she could be having outside of her mansion, she jumps in with both feet.

The ending was surprising and satisfying.  It's simply one of the best times I've had watching a film in a good long time. We just had to buy it.",1357689600,,858,4.568627450980392

A friend introduced me to it a few months ago, and I have been recommending it to my friends that enjoy a good indie movie.  The comedy is often subtle and under the radar, and then interjected with some slapstick humor that goes over the top.

3938832,4,B002JT6A7M,"This tale of two young orphaned brothers who become two of the world's greatest con-men is filled with quirky charm. The youngest brother, Bloom (yes, his name is Bloom Bloom) wants out of the con-game because he cannot stand the never ending dishonesty of a life lived as a story--a well written con crafted to perfection by his older brother, Stephen. The eldest Bloom then seeks to make ""one final con"" to give his brother what he wants: a life unwritten.

The film is ultimately about writing your own story, making your own life, and it makes an inexplicably intentional blunder by letting the audience in on the con's ultimate payoff too early in the plot. In an effort to make up for this reveal, the film's plot becomes so muddled that both the characters and audience no longer know what's part of Stephen's con and what's real. We essentially become like Bloom and distrust everything. A crafty bit of character transference to the audience by writer/director Rian Johnson, but as an audience member it doesn't make for an overall enjoyable movie going experience not knowing which character moments to invest in emotionally. This especially makes for an uneven ending.

However, The Brothers Bloom may been uneven and flawed, but it's overall message that life is an adventure, a story we write ourselves, is a tale we should all hear and hopefully learn from.",1356134400,,1371,4.854700854700854

3938841,5,B002JT6A7M,"There is a lot going on in this movie besides a complex con. Two brothers, Steven and William Bloom are con artists, and that is artists with a capital A. Steven (the older brother) creates cons, so we are told like a dead Russian novelist wrote stories. The best cons are ones where everyone gets what they want. William, the younger brother is shy and reclusive. He denies he is really that way, that is just how his brother scripts him. Yet when William is alone, he is still shy and reclusive. William wants an ""unwritten life"" and leaves his brother, only to be found by his brother months later who needs him for one final con.

Somewhere along the line an Asian woman who speaks very little English, or so it seems, has joined the brothers. She is an expert in demolition. She appears to understand English. Take note of her actions which are typically being done in the background as they are symbolic of the scene or mood of the characters, especially William.

Steven creates cons for his shy brother to meet women, whom William rejects because he convinces himself he doesn't have true feelings for her, because his role is scripted by his brother to talk to her.

The final con involves Rachel Weisz, as Penelope a shy rich recluse who has learned much about life from books and has mastered many arts, including card tricks, which leads one to think, ""Is she part of the con being played on William, or is she actually being conned?"" The beauty of the movie is that we never really find out, although there are all kinds of clues which makes us suspect something more is going on.

Penelope, in spite of all of her smarts has yet to master the left peddle of her sports car. She willingly goes along with the cons and at one point takes the lead.

It's funny, loving, quirky, brotherly, and not what you thought it would be by the end.  It's worth a second viewing after seeing the ending to help pull everything together, but it's just a great movie.

Tortured Bloom who wants to be normal, his brother Stephen who has tried to write a life for him to live, conning people and traveling the world.  There are beautiful backgrounds, explosions, seedy rival con men...It's quirky definitely, but it is worth watching.

When I go in to a movie, I want to be entertained, to be pulled from my own life for a little while.  The Brothers Bloom delivers on that.  It's fun.  Be open minded and take it for what it is....An unusual, amusing, thrill ride that will keep you guessing!",1328054400,,972,4.3259668508287294

It has lush, amazingly varied scenery--St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico, Montenegro, Japan, etc.

It has decent direction.

But it doesn't work.  The problem is the writing.  The movie can't decide whether to be a Romantic Comedy, a Romantic Tragedy, a Caper movie, a Rival Brothers movie, a Character Study, or any of several other things.

It ends up trying to do all these things, and doing them all badly.

Throwing in quirky characters helps, but only temporarily.

Ultimately, the movie lacks energy.  Lacks tension.  Lacks conflict.  Lacks suspense.  Lacks coherence.

It has lots of ideas, lots of (paper-thin) plot, lots of beauty, even lots of interesting lines, but none of these work together.

THE BROTHERS BLOOM purports to be a heist movie, a ""who's conning who?"" trick, an homage to George Roy Hill's THE STING (1973) or Frank Oz's DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (1988).

But BLOOM is actually a film about how people form their life narratives...how and why we write the stories of our lives.

Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) and Bloom (Adrien Brody) have been con-men since childhood. Now, they're all grown up. And Bloom has had enough. He wants out. And his big brother has a plan...an intricately plotted, magnificent plan...one last con.

Only...Bloom falls for the ""mark,"" beguiling American heiress, Penelope (Rachel Weisz). And all bets are off.

Fans of Rian Johnson's BRICK (2005) will recognize the director's stylish directing and whip-smart writing from frame one. Indeed, Johnson is the star of this feel-good travelogue (though Ruffalo, Brody, and Weisz are most compelling). Johnson is spinning a yarn about spinning yarns. And his conclusion--that ""there's no such thing as an unwritten life....only poorly written ones.""--is inspiring.

BLOOM is a fascinating, quickly-paced film that occasionally slows in its good-natured quirkiness. And yet, the sum of its parts is more rewarding than most of its con-film predecessors.",1303689600,,1257,5.3232323232323235

Is your life being controlled by someone who loves you or do you enjoy the freedom and pain of writing your own script. The idea that the writer of the script (older controlling brother) having to die to free his brother is intriguing. I am sure deeper stuff is present in this movie and a thoughtful person can have loads of fun just trying to pick up the angles in the picture. It is just a fun movie more than all.

3938852,5,B002JT6A7M,"I was going to just write this entire review around the brilliance that is Rachel Weisz, but upon reflection it is really an unfair route considering how amazing the film is as a whole.  Wildly imaginative and uniquely inspired, `The Brothers Bloom' is one of the most impressively entertaining cinematic surprises I've experienced as of late.

I just LOVE this movie.

The film centers around two brothers, Stephen and Bloom, who have been con artists since, well, a very young age.  The two of them grew up perfecting the perfect con, and while Bloom wishes to depart from his life of crime, Stephen is convinced that one last con will be the perfect farewell for the both of them.  Their formula consists of a series of twists and turns, all mapped out to perfection by Stephen as he `writes a new life' for the two of them.  With their accomplice, Bang Bang, the brothers venture out to manipulate their last mark, the beautiful yet ridiculously spastic Penelope Stamp.  What neither brother expected was that this last mark would prove to be the end all of a lot of things, especially when Penelope turns out to be more than they ever expected.

The films general construction is the first thing you'll notice.  It is like an adult oriented fairy tale, but when I say `adult' I don't mean perverse.  The sets are gorgeous and the stylistic way in which the editing is done gives the film a playful vibe that meshes beautifully with the complexities of the script.  What is also wonderful is that the film isn't afraid to layer on emotions and moods.  The film is very whimsical, yet it is also dark and brooding.  The layered performances also help create an air of maturity that elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting.  I have always been a fan of Mark Ruffalo (such an effortless actor) and Adrian Brody was in dire need of a comeback (his fabulous `Pianist' performance was starting to look like a fluke) and so watching their effortless chemistry build was just so much fun.  Brody understood how to layer Bloom with an intensity that complimented, while thoughrouly contradicting, the playful carefree nature of Ruffalo's Stephen.  Ruffalo just waltzes through this film like a pro.  I think that is why so many people dismiss his talent (and certainly why he is yet to receive an Oscar nomination).  He is just so natural that he doesn't always stand out.  He blends into the realities of his character.  Rinko Kikuchi (of Babel fame) is also hilariously impressive as the mostly silent Bang Bang.  She is certainly memorable and catches the eye, and mind, of the audience.

For me though, this movie is all about Rachel Weisz.  I mean, what she does with Penelope is outstanding.  The way that she creates a deeply lonesome and desperately sad woman while layering her with so much natural charisma and uproarious humor, all the while NEVER compromising who this woman truly is on the inside (you'll laugh but never forget how devastatingly sad Penelope really is) was just remarkable.

WOW!

In the end I highly, HIGHLY recommend this film.  It is fun and flirty while maintaining a seasoned flare of darkly maniacal pleasures.  It is a con movie, and it shows, but it beautifully marries those characteristics with a fresh approach that makes you feel like a kid again.",1290988800,4,3299,4.750439367311072
3938853,2,B002JT6A7M,"This has auteur written all over it. Pretentious auteur at that.

 The film is basically unwatchable. It is supposedly about a pair of wayward brothers (played by Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody as adults) who are con artists. The whole movie is ove the top, spasmodic, episodic, silly and boring. The direction and cutting are Richard Lester from his Beatles days, but without the skill. Watching this was like watching scenes from many other films, all classics, all emulated poorly here. The script is a mess and difficult to follow with endless flash backs, plot twists that wrap around on themselves and just plain dumb things happening.

 Rachel Weisz plays a poor little rich girl set up as a mark for a con the brothers pull. Instead she shows a talent for the con and falls in love with one of the brothers, setting off a conflict between the brothers that is supposed to end in a mystery, but actually ends in a bore.

 Maximillian Schell shows what happens to actors who still want to work years after their star has faded. He is cast as a joke.

 The only bright spot in this film is a supporting actress by the name of Rinko Kikuchi, whose character is meaningless. But Kikuchi is simply cute and brings a wonderful comic panache to most of her scenes.

 Overall, a waste of time.

3938854,5,B002JT6A7M,"I see from Box Office Mojo that this wonderful creation from the mind of writer/director Rian Johnson made a disappointing $3.5m in (US) domestic business.  That's a shame - this is a really enjoyable, smart, stylish movie that is a wicked blend of drama and comedy.  It blows me away that this most inventive of films sprung from one man's fertile mind.  My plan is to go back and rent Johnson's debut film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>, a favorite of many a movie-watcher.

Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz are three actors to whom I give the benefit of the doubt: I'll watch a movie they are in simply because they'd had the judgment to be in it.  Mark Ruffalo, for example, isn't going to up suddenly and get in a film that has him clambering onto a hurtling asteroid to save the planet Earth.  He's in quality projects.  And Rachel Weisz is like Tina Fey: a sex symbol for those whose lips don't move when they read.  She's never been more adorable than she is here - most notably in a hilarious sequence in which she displays to Brody all the things she's learned while holed up in her mansion over the years: languages; ping-pong; classical piano; rap (over-the-top goofy); break-dancing; karate; juggling (on stilts with chainsaws no less)...you name it.  As Brody's character warns his scheming older brother (Ruffalo) a couple of times:  ""She knows _lots_ of things.""  Brody's character is meant to find Weisz's Penelope irresistible.  And, she is.  In spades.

How smart is Johnson's script?  Smart enough where he could conjure up and act on this thought:  ""Gee, I'd really like to get Rinko Kikuchi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babel/dp/B000MCH5P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babel</a>) into my movie even though she speaks not a word of English.""  Thus, he writes the character of 'Bang-Bang.'  I guarantee you he wrote that part thinking ""I'm putting Rinko Kikuchi in my movie,"" not ""Hmmm...who's going to play 'Bang-Bang'?"".  Her almost-wordless appearance - save a couple of epigrams and one karaoke routine - is a shtick that never gets old.

The deleted scenes on the DVD are well-worth watching with Johnson's commentary turned-on.  It makes you more fully appreciate just how much thought he put into this under-appreciated gem.",1288310400,,2404,5.39142091152815

I had read some reviews and wondered if I'd even be able to follow it because people talked about the convoluted plot, but while it kept me guessing I didn't feel completely lost.

One reviewer says, shouldn't movies be realistic?  Well I hope not!  It's all about escapism to me.  Realism=documentaries.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find a single mainstream movie that is completely realistic.  I'm always saying things like, Oh yeah, like he could jump off a building and not get hurt!

However, I'm very tired of movies that are not realistic and have things happen that seem impossible without even trying to explain how they might be possible if it is inconvenient for the plot.  Maybe I nodded off and missed it, but did they ever explain how Rachel Weisz got away with the book?  Am I just supposed to be so amused by her cute little dance that I don't care how?  Speaking of nodding off, the movie wasn't interesting enough to justify it's nearly 2 hour running time.  Don't read my last beef if you haven't watched the movie.  Hollywood has a long tradition of characters getting shot and acting like it doesn't hurt.  Emergency room doctors have told stories of teenage gang members who get shot and are stunned about how much it actually hurts.  Movies make them think getting shot hurts about as much as a punch in the mouth.  You might say ""ouch"".  Then you shake it off like it's no big deal.  You might even pop up off the floor, do a little dance, and calmly have a conversation with your brother immediately after like Mark Ruffalo does near the end of this movie.  He was shot in the back, but showed no signs of pain or even physical limitation during the performance he gave for his brother.  On top of that.  His brother doesn't even drive back to try to save him once he realizes the blood is real.",1276473600,,1390,4.37890625

3938859,1,B002JT6A7M,"If you are a fan of Adrien Brody's standard screen persona, you will probably like this movie and should ignore this review as irrelevant to you.  For fans of Rachel Weisz: she has too few opportunities to shine as a character, and is mostly just a beautiful presence.  Although Mark Ruffalo is a headliner, his role is that of a lesser supporting character, mostly an expository device.

The predominant characteristics of this movie classify it as a parody.  The minimal plot is irrelevant except as an excuse for the scenes.  The scenes are over-written, over-played and overly stylized, that is, they're a highlight reel. It has absurdities and in-your-face contrivances.  And you are to appreciate how ""knowing"" and clever the writers, director and actors are of the genre, as opposed to the _movie_ being knowing and clever (other reviewers here had negative reactions to this, for example Nathan Beauchamp's 4-star of 2009-11-24).  You even have a scene that is cute, but doesn't fit: Penelope (Weisz) spots, and comments on, the literary allusions to Melville's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Confidence-Man/dp/0199554854/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Confidence-Man</a>, but the movie proceeds as if that scene had never occurred.  All this is consistent with a perfectly good parody.

The attribute of parodies missing here is laughs--there are knowing smiles, and a few chuckles, but no laughs.  Penelope (Weisz) provides set-ups, but those sparks are smothered by Bloom's (Brody) wet blanket.

Intertwined with the parody elements is a romance.  This could have worked if that portion of the story was uptempo, breezy, brash, ... (or screwball?), and Weisz's performance leaned in this direction.  However, the casting of Brody effectively required the romance to be downbeat, moody/sentimental, atmospheric, sweet, quirky, ...  (This is not a criticism of Brody, but of pairing him with the script).  The two clashing demands on pacing resulted in neither working.

The con itself is uninteresting: It is never fleshed-out nor clever but simply a rough checklist, as befits a parody.  Consequently, there is absolutely no emotional involvement.  My only (faint) curiosity about the con was about which of the minor variants the writers would choose for the next stage.

If the movie had been much, much shorter, the clash of the various elements might have created a mildly entertaining confusion.  But stretched out as it is, it is boring if not irritating.",1273363200,5,2520,5.496103896103896

And, when it looked like the plot was wrapping up, I hunkered down and got set for a predictable, but satisfying ending.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. After it was SUPPOSED to end, the movie goes on for what seems like forever, with more cons, cons within cons, and eventually darkness, death and destruction.

3938866,5,B002JT6A7M,"I see from Box Office Mojo that this wonderful creation from the mind of writer/director Rian Johnson made a disappointing $3.5m in (US) domestic business.  That's a shame - this is a really enjoyable, smart, stylish movie that is a wicked blend of drama and comedy.  It blows me away that this most inventive of films sprung from one man's fertile mind.  My plan is to go back and rent Johnson's debut film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>, a favorite of many a movie-watcher.

Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz are three actors to whom I give the benefit of the doubt: I'll watch a movie they are in simply because they'd had the judgment to be in it.  Mark Ruffalo, for example, isn't going to up suddenly and get in a film that has him clambering onto a hurtling asteroid to save the planet Earth.  He's in quality projects.  And Rachel Weisz is like Tina Fey: a sex symbol for those whose lips don't move when they read.  She's never been more adorable than she is here - most notably in a hilarious sequence in which she displays to Brody all the things she's learned while holed up in her mansion over the years: languages; ping-pong; classical piano; rap (over-the-top goofy); break-dancing; karate; juggling (on stilts with chainsaws no less)...you name it.  As Brody's character warns his scheming older brother (Ruffalo) a couple of times:  ""She knows _lots_ of things.""  Brody's character is meant to find Weisz's Penelope irresistible.  And, she is.  In spades.

How smart is Johnson's script?  Smart enough where he could conjure up and act on this thought:  ""Gee, I'd really like to get Rinko Kikuchi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babel/dp/B000MCH5P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babel</a>) into my movie even though she speaks not a word of English.""  Thus, he writes the character of 'Bang-Bang.'  I guarantee you he wrote that part thinking ""I'm putting Rinko Kikuchi in my movie,"" not ""Hmmm...who's going to play 'Bang-Bang'?"".  Her almost-wordless appearance - save a couple of epigrams and one karaoke routine - is a shtick that never gets old.

The deleted scenes on the DVD are well-worth watching with Johnson's commentary turned-on.  It makes you more fully appreciate just how much thought he put into this under-appreciated gem.",1266019200,4,2404,5.39142091152815
3938867,2,B002JT6A7M,"""The Brothers Bloom"" starts with a prologue about a pair of orphans Stephen and Bloom, and their first attempt to swindle money ($ 30) from the rich kids in the neighborhood. Stephen says, without irony perhaps, ""The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted."" The long introductory part, narrated by Ricky Jay, sets the tone of ""The Brothers loom"" directed by Rian Johnson, which some describe as ""post-modern caper film.""

25 years later, we meet the grown-up ""brothers"" again, now pro con artists. But Bloom (Adrian Brody) quits, saying he is tired of his con business, only to join the team again for the last time. Stephen (Mark Ruffalo), Bloom, and a Japanese explosive expert ""Bang Bang"" (Rinko Kikuchi) plan to pull a con on a mega-billionaire Penelope (Rachel Weisz), who seems very weary of her boring life. This time, however, one thing is different. Bloom falls in love with her for real. .

""The Brothers Bloom"" is not about elaborate con tricks pulled by the brothers. It is about the characters and the interactions between them, especially about Bloom, Stephen and Penelope. However, the film, which looks as self-absorbed as its characters themselves, goes on forever. The film is not without whimsical charms, but despite the best efforts from Adrian Brody, Mark Ruffalo, Rinko Kikuchi and Rachel Weisz (she is just brilliant here), I find it very hard to connect to any of the characters on the screen.

With silly costumes and too many twists, ""The Brothers Bloom"" tries to be so quirky when it doesn't need to. It has a style that tries too hard to impress. Beautifully shot and well-acted, ""The Brothers Bloom"" is about characters and events stylishly described, characters and events we don't care much.",1265673600,3,1759,4.9358108108108105

Anyway, the movie tries way too hard to be smart, and some of it was creative, but it just lacked that one important thing that keeps the audience interested: Entertainment! Its a shame, I all three actors, but just the way the movie did not flow right, trying to be funny in places when it was not, it was just downright boring.  I'll be honest, I thought it was so bad I didn't finish it.

It did however remind me of an older movie about two con artists, which was funny and entertaining, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine.  I do not recommend the Brothers Bloom movie.",1262563200,,723,4.5038167938931295
3938869,3,B002JT6A7M,"The Bottom Line:

I love movies about con men and I loved Brick (director Johnson's first film) but I have to report that The Brothers Bloom (which I actually saw in theaters no less) is a bland, boring film enlivened only by Rinko Kikuchi's performance as Bang Bang; though the film is by no means terrible, it has so little to recommend it that I would easily rather watch an amusingly bad movie (like anything with Dolph Lundgren in it) than suffer through The Brothers  Bloom again.

3938870,3,B002JT6A7M,"Whether you love or hate the movies of Wes Anderson, you have to admit that his films have a style and tone that is nearly unmistakable (I happen to love his films). His movies have a combination of quirky humor, odd and melancholy characters, and frequently unexpected sad twists. The camera work is almost deliberately obtrusive, as though he wants you to be very aware that you're looking at people...rather than JOINING them. I find his tone of sadness and intelligent, cynical humor to be engaging...but I also recognize that it leaves a lot of people cold.

I now have a better understanding of that side of Anderson after seeing THE BROTHERS BLOOM (not directed by Anderson). Writer/director Rian Johnson (BRICK...also stylistically pushy) has crafted a movie with the morose characters and amusing plot leading to some heartbreak with which Anderson has lately been identified. His characters dress in unorthodox manners and live in a world disconnected from what we think of as familiar. But the film has a loose, flabby feel and sometimes when it wants to indulge in ""feelings"" it forgets to keep moving. There are certainly moments of fun, particularly early on...but in the end, it was an unsatisfying journey.

Stephen (the elder) and his brother Bloom (the younger) spend their childhoods drifting from one foster home to another. These are smart boys, but eager to put their smarts to less than honest works. While Bloom would clearly like to just be a nice, shy boy leading a normal if bookish life...Stephen has a reckless energy (and a keen desire to make his brother something more) and uses this intelligence to devise elaborate con games. Bloom is reluctant, but as it turns out, very good. Stephen is the scriptwriter and supporting actor, but Bloom is always the star.

They grow up and eventually in their late 30's they grow apart. Or rather, Bloom dumps his brother to go live a solitary, sad life, thinking about all the people whose emotions he's manipulated in order to take their money. Naturally, Stephen finds him and sets up the story of ""one last con."" Bloom reluctantly agrees. They are going to steal millions from lonely heiress Penelope (Rachel Weisz)...but it turns out not to be so easy, because Penelope is eager to get involved in shenanigans herself. As they travel the world, it's not always clear who is double crossing whom, nor is it clear who is feeling what for whom. We think, from time to time, that Bloom is REALLY falling for Penelope...or he might be a really good actor.

I won't hint at more of the plot, but I will say that the con itself was not very elaborate or satisfying. I had expected the film to have a more THE STING-like complexity...but really the events play out in a very linear fashion that did not leave me impressed. Even the ""twist"" ending was nothing terribly surprising. I realized then, that writer/director Johnson had more on his mind than the plot...he was doing a character study. However, he mostly showed us behaviors and nothing very deep about the inner workings of the characters.

Bloom (Adrien Brody...doing his best ""sad sack"") is clearly a man in turmoil over his lifestyle. That was the one emotion I could really connect to and understand. Unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot else to him. In one scene, he steals an apple and makes an attempt to escape, and we see the joy on his face at the delight of running through beautiful fields of flowers with angry folks chasing him. It was a return to the simpler times of his childhood...and a lovely scene. One of too few. Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) is much more of a cipher. He's the big brother. He's the schemer who can't imagine any other life than that of a con artist. He doesn't seem to get how his brother feels or to feel guilty about what he does...yet apparently he is a keen observer of human behavior. Ruffalo does fine in the role, but the script has truly relegated him to the background much of the time. Weisz is a delightful oddball. Not a convincing ""real life"" person...but she has an expressive face and a bumbling physicality that was surprising coming from her. I enjoyed her performance, even as I realized that I wasn't actually terribly interested in Penelope. I think I was enjoying Weisz having a lark more than I was enjoying her creating a flesh and blood character.

Stephen and Bloom (it's never explained why the film is called THE BROTHERS BLOOM...doesn't that imply this is their last name? Perhaps Bloom has never gone by his first name? Who knows?) are assisted in their cons by Bang Bang, a Japanese explosives expert who hardly makes a sound. She's played with great style by Rinko Kikuchi (BABEL), but again, is not for one second a believable person...she's an amusing idea and Kikuchi is having a blast playing her.

The film frequently turns ""serious"" and then wants to be lighthearted again. What it doesn't seem to understand is that sometimes BOTH tones can exist in the same scene. Something Anderson does well, and something Johnson can't manage.

The film is also shot in a very dark, muted palette. The main characters wear mostly black, white and gray. The cities around them (Montenegro, Prague, etc.) all are the same muddy color, and the sky always looks like rain is just around the corner. It was, to be blunt, a somewhat ugly film to look at. For one extended period, Penelope finally wears some color, but it's a horrid orange serape sort of thing that makes Weisz look like a big ochre block with a head. I can appreciate muted palette's and such...but all the efforts at light-hearted fun have most of the fun leached from them by the dark atmosphere.

THE BROTHERS BLOOM did have its sporadic moments of fun. Weisz works really hard and Brody & Ruffalo are always pleasant to watch. But I just felt the film was trying far too hard and missing the mark too often to get a recommendation from me. A disappointment.",1261958400,2,5912,4.732038834951457

I was able to easily follow the story and it made me fall even more in love with Rachel Weisz! Again, Johnson delivers a distinct film set apart from its peers in an age of CGI and slam-bam movies that don't focus too much on story and structure.

Nevertheless, definitely worth a look and one of my favorites of the year!",1261440000,,1446,7.5058823529411764
3938873,4,B002JT6A7M,"There's one brother named Bloom in The Brothers Bloom -- the other one is named Stephen -- which is only the first odd and confusing thing about this film. (It's self-consciously artsy enough that I feel compelled to call it a ""film"" rather than a ""movie."") The two brothers are con men, as we learn when we see them as boys in the pre-credit sequence, learning their trade.

The next odd and confusing thing about The Brothers Bloom is the question of when, exactly, it's set. The characters wear clothes that are mostly inspired by the '20s and '30s -- black suits and hats for our heroes, similarly classy and non-contemporary looks for the rest -- and take steamships to cross the Atlantic. But there's a conspicuously modern sports car, and other touches make it clear that this is not set in the past. Perhaps it's set in some alternate world, or just a more stylish version of our world. Perhaps the movie itself is a complicated con game?

After those oddities, the rest of Brothers Bloom's stylish touches -- such as Bang Bang, the Japanese girlfriend/sidekick of Stephen, who says, I believe, precisely two words of dialogue in the course of the movie, or the semi-etched-on-glass, semi-scrawled-on-slips-of-paper occasional intertitles -- go down easily. Brothers Bloom is a movie confident in itself, and one that knows how to tell a story. It knows, for example, that if you do something repeatedly, you really should do it three and exactly three times. It knows that good stories set things up carefully, and then leave it up to the audience to recognize the payoffs. And it knows, most of all, that what we want is to watch fascinating people doing interesting things.

This is a story about con men and their cons, so it wouldn't do to talk too much about the plot. There are surprises and grace notes, cons revealed and cons left assumed, gunfire and explosions, fire and fake blood and real blood. Stephen and Bloom are young in the pre-credit sequence, and in their late thirties in the main plot of the movie -- Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) fully in possession of his powers as a storyteller and artist in confidence, Bloom (Adrien Brody) conflicted, depressed, and perpetually threatening to go straight. And Penelope (Rachel Weisz) is a gorgeous, vastly wealthy young woman whom they come into contact with.

Brothers Bloom is a deeply self-consciously stylish movie, very much in love with itself as a storytelling vehicle -- note, just for one example, how those three main characters are lightly borrowed from Joyce's Ulysses -- and it lives up to its own image of itself almost entirely. All the flash and stage patter does make it a primarily superficial movie; the emotional truths here are all familiar ones, so as not to detract from the glitter and shine. The ending reaches for emotional depth, but doesn't quite achieve it -- Brothers Bloom had spent too much time being slick and witty to be able to stretch that far back in the other direction -- but it is fitting and poignant, which is good enough. Brothers Bloom is a quite good con-man movie, for all the fact that it's trying so very hard to completely transcend being a con-man movie in the first place.",1259971200,5,3189,4.76130198915009
3938874,4,B002JT6A7M,"Whimsical, sentimental, colorful, and both funny and awkward, THE BROTHERS BLOOM is original in its context and characters even if the plot itself is relatively predictable. The tale of two brothers who learn at an early age their skill at pulling off confidence schemes (all in the film's well designed and funny first 10 minutes). They continue to run cons into their early thirties when Bloom (Brody), the younger of the two, is faced with a bit of a quarter-life-crisis and decides to quit conning alongside his older brother Stephen (Mark Ruffalo). Of course he returns on the premise of helping Stephen carry off 'one last job,' the most glaringly cliched element in the entire film. All is forgiven however as the cast of characters unfolds, and director Rian Johnson rolls out more story arc. We meet Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi), a semi-mute Asian woman with a penchant for blowing things to pieces and Penelope Stamp (Rachel Weisz), a billionaire heiress & collector of strange hobbies. Weisz is convincingly awkward, funny, intelligent, and ultimately lovable. Weisz, Brody, and Ruffalo give good performances but are still all outclassed by Rinko Kikuchi's portrayal of Bang Bang. She communicates much with few to no words. She is the master of the subtle facial expression and she singlehandedly raised this film from 3 stars to 4 for this viewer.

Rian Johnson's directorial style resembles Wes Anderson's, but with more of a penchant for sweetness. THE BROTHERS BLOOM is littered with sentimental twists, moments, and visuals. Johnson's craft is still developing, with his this, his sophomore effort, falling slightly short of his wonderful first film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>. The gentle goodnaturedness of the film is surprisingly refreshing in a movie marketplace littered with grit, angst, and cynicism. I think this is why the film scored so poorly with paid reviewers; they were too afraid of seeming soft by liking the movie and being branded as 'sentimental.' The film has a sweetness to it that may turn off some viewers, but to me is was a nice change of pace from the typical Hollywood offering.

As the film progresses it does a decent enough job of not revealing too much and providing the viewer a plausible suspension of disbelief. There are a few moments that don't ring true (the first encounter with Diamond Dog at the bar for example--actually I didn't like the Diamond Dog character at all and thought he was superfluous to the plot and movie as a whole) but they are few and far between. My strongest criticism of the film is that Johnson, Brody, and the rest of the cast know how clever certain elements of the film are, and they let the audience know that they know. Clever is fine, but I don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that the movie is oh so smart. Another confusing plot element is Penelope's seeming inability to drive a sports car--this from a woman who has mastered more than a few difficult hobbies including pinhole photography and martial arts!

Overall this is a very enjoyable movie if you appreciate warmth in film. It's sentimental. It's bright and fun and intelligent.

3938879,4,B002JT6A7M,"Got the movie because of the cast. Rachel Weisz, Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo any one of them is watchable but all three together was a must see in my book.

A story of con men brothers who grew up perfecting the con game and crafting the perfect story. Well, one brother anyway. Ruffalo writes the scripts and Brody fumbles through more and more complicated plots hating the game and detesting himself for playing it. With the promise of an end in sight they agree to one more con before parting ways.

The con involves an eccentric little rich girl (Weisz) who apparently has a stable full of the identical car because as she crashes one another is delivered in its place. After crashing said car into Bloom (Brody) she becomes intrigued by him and his story. She is a very talented self-taught woman with a thirst for adventure. This new con, new script doesn't quite end up the way it was intended to end.

Great acting. The cast must have had a blast. And this is a quirky almost whimsical film with an old fashioned feel. It reminded me of Pushing Daisies if you had an opportunity to ever watch that little television gem. Weisz has a few interesting scenes, one a little embarrassing that puts it in the ""not for kids"" category. (Think the diner scene in Harry and Sally but on a train.) Though kids would probably not be real interested in the slower pace of the film, so that might be a moot point.

Be warned. As charming as this campy quirky adventure is, the pervasive thick vein of melancholy almost chokes it at times. Bloom grows so embittered he is willing to chew his leg off to escape the trap he's in. Enter his brother who loves Bloom enough to write the ultimate script.",1256256000,7,1690,4.4772727272727275

The Brothers Bloom is incredibly quirky, occasionally to the point of being surreal, with a score that sounds a bit cabaret or vaudevillian, mixed with a twisted circus.  It suits the film to a T!  The effect of the elder brother spinning yarns throughout, in a somewhat poetic manner (the younger finding this exercise absolutely exhausting and nerve-wracking!) made it easy to follow the Brothers' mindset:  they twist reality through their cons, and the world seems to easily bend to the stories.  When things go awry, however, strangeness is amplified.  The bizarre becomes quite normal, especially because the mark they choose introduces herself as an epileptic photographer who, having virtually no social contact in her life, is awkward and collects unusual hobbies.

Another reviewer described it as Ocean's 11 meets The Royal Tenenbaums.  That's cute, but still doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of this film.  I felt a bit of a Burtonesque (or Gorey) touch to it, as well.

However, while this film had a similar dark and dry humor, it was much faster paced, and had a very unique flair.

Adrien Brody was genius, as usual. Brody had me glued to the screen in every scene, but in the end, I actually felt that Rian Johnson didn't utilize Brody as much as he could have. Rachel Weisz gave, in my opinion, one of the best performance of her career (probably just as good, if not better, than her performance in The Fountain). This role allowed her to explore a unique, funny, and complex character. And though I initially thought it was odd to pair Mark Ruffalo with these two, he did a very decent job.

The film was, for the most part, a comedy. Lots of laughs. But it also asks some deeper questions about life, some tragedy and irony, and it was a very fun exercise in character development.

I actually didn't care much for Rian Johnson's previous film (Brick), but I would LOVE to see more Brothers Bloom! Perhaps a prequel, or a cast reunion movie. Brothers Bloom was not without its problems (I believed, for example, the intro sequence and story background was a bit too long). But I don't hesitate giving it a full 5-stars. Definitely in my top 10 list for 2009.",1255564800,7,1805,5.505415162454874
3938884,3,B002JT6A7M,"This tale of two young orphaned brothers who become two of the world's greatest con-men is filled with quirky charm. The youngest brother, Bloom (yes, his name is Bloom Bloom) wants out of the con-game because he cannot stand the never ending dishonesty of a life lived as a story--a well written con crafted to perfection by his older brother, Stephen. The eldest Bloom then seeks to make ""one final con"" to give his brother what he wants: a life unwritten.

The film is ultimately about writing your own story, making your own life, and makes an inexplicably intentional blunder by letting the audience in on the con's ultimate payoff too early in the plot. In an effort to make up for this reveal, the film's plot becomes so muddled that both the characters and audience no longer know what's part of Stephen's con and what's real. We essentially become like Bloom and distrust everything. A crafty bit of character transference to the audience by writer/director Rian Johnson, but as an audience member it doesn't make for an overall enjoyable movie going experience not knowing which character moments to invest in emotionally. This especially makes for an uneven ending.

However, The Brothers Bloom may been uneven and flawed, but it's overall message that life is an adventure, a story we write ourselves, is a tale we should all hear and hopefully learn from.",1255219200,3,1368,4.866952789699571
3938885,4,B002JT6A7M,"Whimsical, sentimental, colorful, and both funny and awkward, THE BROTHERS BLOOM is original in its context and characters even if the plot itself is relatively predictable. The tale of two brothers who learn at an early age their skill at pulling off confidence schemes (all in the film's well designed and funny first 10 minutes). They continue to run cons into their early thirties when Bloom (Brody), the younger of the two, is faced with a bit of a quarter-life-crisis and decides to quit conning alongside his older brother Stephen (Mark Ruffalo). Of course he returns on the premise of helping Stephen carry off 'one last job,' the most glaringly cliched element in the entire film. All is forgiven however as the cast of characters unfolds, and director Rian Johnson rolls out more story arc. We meet Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi), a semi-mute Asian woman with a penchant for blowing things to pieces and Penelope Stamp (Rachel Weisz), a billionaire heiress & collector of strange hobbies. Weisz is convincingly awkward, funny, intelligent, and ultimately lovable. Weisz, Brody, and Ruffalo give good performances but are still all outclassed by Rinko Kikuchi's portrayal of Bang Bang. She communicates much with few to no words. She is the master of the subtle facial expression and she singlehandedly raised this film from 3 stars to 4 for this viewer.

Rian Johnson's directorial style resembles Wes Anderson's, but with more of a penchant for sweetness. THE BROTHERS BLOOM is littered with sentimental twists, moments, and visuals. Johnson's craft is still developing, with his this, his sophomore effort, falling slightly short of his wonderful first film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>. The gentle goodnaturedness of the film is surprisingly refreshing in a movie marketplace littered with grit, angst, and cynicism. I think this is why the film scored so poorly with paid reviewers; they were too afraid of seeming soft by liking the movie and being branded as 'sentimental.' The film has a sweetness to it that may turn off some viewers, but to me is was a nice change of pace from the typical Hollywood offering.

As the film progresses it does a decent enough job of not revealing too much and providing the viewer a plausible suspension of disbelief. There are a few moments that don't ring true (the first encounter with Diamond Dog at the bar for example--actually I didn't like the Diamond Dog character at all and thought he was superfluous to the plot and movie as a whole) but they are few and far between. My strongest criticism of the film is that Johnson, Brody, and the rest of the cast know how clever certain elements of the film are, and they let the audience know that they know. Clever is fine, but I don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that the movie is oh so smart. Another confusing plot element is Penelope's seeming inability to drive a sports car--this from a woman who has mastered more than a few difficult hobbies including pinhole photography and martial arts!

Overall this is a very enjoyable movie if you appreciate warmth in film. It's sentimental. It's bright and fun and intelligent. Viewers who prefer their cinema to be dark and brooding should probably skip this one and watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River/dp/B0001ZX0OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;instead.
