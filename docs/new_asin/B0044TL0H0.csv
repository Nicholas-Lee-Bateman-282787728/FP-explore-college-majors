There are much better Japanese pink films out there (Tokyo Decadence, Wife to be Sacrificed, ...) In fact of the thirty or so I've owned or seen this is probably the tamest and lamest of them all.",1320624000,11,371,4.152777777777778

Saying that the guys in this office are obsessed fans of Japanese women and Japanese porn would be the understatement of the year. Being one of them, I was happy to hear that Ayaka Is Your Angel is a""pink"" film made specifically for American audiences in a way to introduce the genre to new viewers. What I didn't come to expect, however, is how much I really liked this movie that is an inviting movie with one sexy model who we wish was our own personal angel.

Japan's Pink Cinema might not seem like such an odd concept to us North American viewers mainly because we've seen solo and POV features here before but North America's Studio Happy Chicken adds its own elegant and quirky touch to their features. Ayaka is my Angel, for example, features a number of scenarios where the gorgeous Ayaka is an angel that has come from Heaven to fulfill your deepest desires.

If angels are real I hope they look like Ayaka who is a blue-eyed Japanese goddess with a deliciously curvy body and delicate yet striking facial features. She's a playful vixen with pink wings who cheerfully wants to act out your personal fantasies as she tells you when she first appears in your messy bedroom. Her first act is to give you a peek of what its like to have such a hot babe sleeping over your pad wearing nothing more than your unbuttoned work shirt and your superhero underwear (sadly an echo of my life).

Oh Ayaka, how is it that you make stuttering around in a messy bedroom and slipping underneath the bedcovers to slip out of a shirt so damn sexy? She shows nothing but at the same time manages to leave us with our imaginations running wild as to what that body looks like under those sheets.

Moving on, though, Ayaka thinks that last fantasy was pretty tame and wants to take it a step forward by stepping into a hot tub wearing nothing but strategically placed red and white flower pedals covering her nipples and her - ahem - bikini area. She gets into the water, splashing herself with the water filled with red and white pedals and yes those pesky pedals that were stuck to her nipples are gone. This is the first time we catch a decent glimpse of Ayaka naked and she looks just as good as we imagined. What a guy wouldn't give to hop into a hot tub with her.

Knowing she looked good wet, Ayaka fulfills another fantasy, this one is her in the shower wearing the most skimpiest bikini in Japan. She cheerfully makes sure water rolls off her lovely breasts and the side of her flawless backside. Ok, the bikini doesn't come off and that might be unsetting but with Ayaka's gestures and lively nature it's pretty hard to want to complain.

The next scenario she has planned for us is becoming your private host at a Japanese host club (a popular spot where men pay women to sit and chat with them in private booths). Just as you might have guess, our angel looks good in a sexy pink outfit as she rubs her delicate lips with the blue liquor she drinks. She sings karaoke for you (although we don't actually hear her sing) and sensually eats what looks like orange chicken in a way that I will always remember each time I order said entr&eacute;e at Panda Express.

In another segment, Ayaka tells us she might like the next scenario and she isn't kidding. She's dressed in purple lingerie. She slowly peels off each mesh stocking to rub her legs and continues to rub the rest of her body as if she was inviting you to feel that soft skin of hers. The big payoff comes when she gets a hold of a bottle with a long neck, simulating the tantalizing oral things she could do to you. The last bit is a surprising bit of tease before she vanishes.

What we have in Ayaka is my Angel is a pink film that is simply one of the best in its genre and that's thanks to great production values and a model who is able to carry said movie without breaking a sweat. Ayaka handles each scenario well enough and its hard to ignore how hot she is while she's attempting to please her audience. Score one for Studio Happy Chicken because this one is a winner.",1287964800,4,4088,4.382585751978892
