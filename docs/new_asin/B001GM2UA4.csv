8305961,5,B001GM2UA4,"Finally! I'm so thrilled with these DVDs. One would have to spend a lot of money to travel to Middle-East to study with these masters, now thank to these DVDs you can have a private lesson with them every day at your home. I love the routines, love the interviews and love the live shots of the shows and performances. There is so much more on these DVDs than just learning the steps. Great collection! Thank you Natasha Senkovich for producing and bringing these DVDs to us.
