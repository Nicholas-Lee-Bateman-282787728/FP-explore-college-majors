1737021,4,B00006ADD6,"What a little surprise this one turns out to be!!!!Definitely a low budget Indie, but with lots of savvy and an extremely charming and clever script,HIT AND RUNWAY is an intelligent and humourous look at the seemingly unlikely partnership/collaboration of Alex,an Italian straight guy who teams with Elliot,a Woody Allenesque gay Jew to write a hit screenplay and leave their old,dull,meaningless lives behind. That is the premise of this film on the surface,but what the viewer gets is a perfectly charming 101 minutes full of extremely interesting twists and turns and frankly some really honest and good acting from Mark Parducci and Peter Jacobson in the principle roles who forge a positively comical bond and bring all of their talents to flesh out these two wannabes. With all of the fluff that churns out of Hollywood,HIT AND RUNWAY can undoubtedly be termed a real sleeper hit. Yes, the film is full of formula and stereotypes,but it's been a long time since this reviewer has seen that genre done so heartfelt. Is it a great film? Well, that is subjective. Is it an infectious and enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining  and intelligent piece of cinema? ABSOLUTELY!!!",1175558400,8,1176,5.061855670103093
1737022,5,B00006ADD6,"What starts out on the level of ""Kiss Me Guido"" or ""Just One Time"" dares to actually go one level deeper.  If Woody Alan would ever get in touch with his feminine side, he could have written this screenplay.
For film industry people, the plot, and its devices, requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief at times (or at least the ability to close one eye occasionally), but the little surprises, twists and arcs will touch even the most jaded amongst us.
Very commendable performances by both Michael Parducci and Peter Jacobson.
Long live the indi film industry!",1043971200,11,573,4.787878787878788
1737023,5,B00006ADD6,"This is one of the funneist films I have ever seen.  Don't disregard this film becuase of the lack of big hollywood actors, the actors do an excellent job, especially the lead, Michael Parducci.  My whole family was involved in the making of this in one way or another.  My uncle Jaffe Cohen wrote the script, my grandparents, parents, cousins and uncles were all extras and I had a speaking role, so take it form me this movie is worth watching.",1040688000,2,446,4.481481481481482
1737024,5,B00006ADD6,"No, really..... why can't ""Hollywood"" make films of this caliber? This is just like, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, in terms of being a great film that relies on story, plot & acting to carry the film, not big name stars or big time special effects. I loved the movie and laughed all the way through. I only wish more people had had a chance to see it.",1031184000,13,347,4.117647058823529
1737045,5,B00006ADD6,"I really liked this film and will watch it again. A definite spin on the 'odd couple' with quality writing and performances. It has a low budget, indie feel which might not appeal to some. It should definitely appeal to writers or anyone that dreamed of writing a screenplay.",1426636800,,275,4.63265306122449

1737049,4,B00006ADD6,"Hit and Runway is a delightfully amusing story about a confused young (definitely straight) Italian boy who yearns to be a screen writer and finds himself hooked up a kind of ""Woody Alan"" character whose emotional struggles seem endless - a kind of ""Odd Couple"" film told with some really talented actors.  I think you'll love the way it all ends . . .",1413676800,,352,4.5

1737054,5,B00006ADD6,"This movie is a gem!  If you're searching for something to watch then stop right now and go with his one. A funny, sweet, brilliant story with exceptionally good acting by the two leads. If you want a shallow film with gorgeous eye candy and a vacuous plot and characters then you'll probably want to move on. But, if you want a story and characters with substance and depth then you're going to love this movie.",1398729600,,412,4.421052631578948
1737065,4,B00006ADD6,This flick was totally entertaining. It even made me laugh out loud a few times. I'll probably even watch it again.,1394150400,,115,4.523809523809524
1737066,5,B00006ADD6,"When I first selected this film to watch via my Amazon Prime account, I did not have super expectations that it would be anything but a waste of time and a way to fill in some space while I Occupied my Sofa during a recent bout of sickness. But boy was ever happy to be proven wrong! Not only was the film funny and entertaining, ""Elliot"" is the new surprise standout in this fllm. He is a strong character with scruples who knows what he wants, even if he is not sure he can get it. The pairing with ""Alex"" at first glance a more stereotypical Italian stud, seems unlikely but in the end quite satisfying. They make a great couple, even if they are never able to be more than just friends. I loved how Elliot schools Alex and how Alex learns and grows as the film progresses. There are a few cliched plot lines from time to time, but the dialog is funny and didactic at the same time. All in all, Elliot as the new, non-neurotic, Woody Allen-like character is what makes the movie. Sure, Alex is cute and sexy, but the film also helps one see that Elliot is those things too, but just in different ways. This romp of a movie is fun and entertaining in all the good ways. I loved it and I think you just might too.",1380499200,,1214,4.170212765957447
1737067,2,B00006ADD6,"Cute movie, but was very predictable.  For the gays who like the pretty boy with tight and obvious bulge! So two stars it is!",1378166400,,125,4.208333333333333
1737068,4,B00006ADD6,The movie had a different twist to it but I was funny and I enjoyed the movie.  The acting was good and I would recommend this movie.,1369785600,,133,3.925925925925926
1737069,5,B00006ADD6,"Low budget doesn't nessaraly mean bad, and this film proves it.  This is one of the best 'odd couple' films I've ever seen!  Charicter driven from start to finish, it's funny, dramatic, and warm with a touch of sadness at the end that only and perfectly shows how fiction and real life can combine to enlighten.  A good film to watch with your significant other of whatever orientation!  Enjoy!",1368057600,4,394,4.666666666666667
1737070,5,B00006ADD6,"I'm not a real Woody Allen fan so I am surprised I liked this. Unlike Woody Allen this guy was funnier, his timing was great, he related well to the other characture, and he was actually handsome, all qualities that make you forgive the attempted ""Gay Woody Allen"" flavor. Although I enjoyed the other main characture it could have been played by anyone
(Why not someone a little more out going).",1365033600,,396,4.591549295774648
1737071,5,B00006ADD6,"So many gay movies are so poorly filmed, acted, written, clich, shallow and predictable. ""Hit and Runway"" is none of these things. There is actually character development, and the story takes very unexpected turns. The writing is engaging and believable. The actors do a great job at portraying their characters. It is witty and funny. I highly recommend this movie.",1363564800,3,366,5.116666666666666
1737072,2,B00006ADD6,"WHO are all these sock puppets raving about this extra-lame version of the screenwriter-who-is-having-trouble-with-his-script movie?  The p.a.'s still dreaming they are actually going to get paid? (Hint: you are never going to see a penny, so please give it up with the fake raves.) Yawn!  This movie been done so much better, so many times before.  The story is a snore and sadly the actors rarely rise to the level of mediocre, let alone anything resembling chemistry.  They might as well be in different flicks altogether so little do they actually relate with one another.  True, I've watched worse movies, but seldom such a boring one.",1362528000,,640,5.0
1737073,2,B00006ADD6,This movie has a gay character but it's hardly more than incidental to the action which is slow and mundane.,1360281600,3,108,4.45

It caught me off guard in a bunch of places with its many twists and turns. It had a lot of heart toward the end, which was its redeeming feature. I grew to care about the lead actor. It is a cute movie about redemption, I guess. I would watch it again. The acting was good. Good cast of characters. Was it stretching things a bit far at times? Maybe, but I laughed at some of them and just stayed for the ride, and I was glad that I did. Worth watching.",1469232000,,625,3.8828125
