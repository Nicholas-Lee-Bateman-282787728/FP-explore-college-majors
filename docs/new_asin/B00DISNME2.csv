8593607,5,B00DISNME2,Loved being back in the Loire Valley again via this video...what a beautiful place and what a nice way to enjoy it...sitting in the den and not in the front seat of a car...but a perfect activity on my Exercise Bike...,1461628800,,218,4.341463414634147
8593608,4,B00DISNME2,I would recommend. I have been indoor cycling for over a month now and these videos have made it fun,1391385600,,100,4.05
8593609,4,B00DISNME2,"The scenery is nice.  The music is ok, sometimes, of course, you can always mute it and listen to your own music :-)  But ... whoever is pedaling or driving is going too fast, as I doubt I could ever pedal that fast for that long.  If they slow down, just a bit, it would be 5 stars as sometimes it's blur-o-vision.  Were these made by Lance Armstrong?  All in all it's a good choice and a great alternative to watching regular tv while biking.  What would really be great is if they sold books on dvd or blu ray where the scenery matched, at least in some way, the story while someone was reading to you .... as it's hard to read while pedaling, even on a kindle.  I'm not sure that Shakespeare or Harry Potter works for biking but maybe Buster's Midnight Cafe or any Alice Hoffman book. I wonder when amazon will start beaming books directly into our brain ... for a price of course.  Like combine google and amazon into, say, googazon or amagoog or gamazonoogle ... instant knowledge, and, well, some stuff you didn't want to know too.",1386028800,2,1038,4.341968911917099
8593610,5,B00DISNME2,"I think I saw a PBS special on this area once with Rick Steves or something that was mostly interior pictures of the cathedrals and chateaux.  Now, though I really feel as though I've been there!
 My review on the ride?  This isn't one of those up and down and all around rides like Sequoia National Park or something, its rather mild and flat.  But oh- the scenery!  There are these bright, bright yellow fields that the cover of the dvd says are mustard fields, which are just gorgeous to experience- I totally forgot I was just in my exercise room at home.  And there are actually some beautiful mansions and cute french towns but what I like is that I retain the memories so much better when I'm pedaling, feeling like I'm ""exploring"" than if I was half-asleep on the couch watching somebody's narrated travelogue.  Definitely recommended!",1374537600,,843,4.655405405405405
