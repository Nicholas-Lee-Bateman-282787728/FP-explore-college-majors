8487913,5,B005WHFLBO,I enjoyed the 2011 tattoo very much. I have gone to several Tattoos oronto Ontario because I like British Military music especially pipes and drums.,1489449600,,148,4.96
8487914,5,B005WHFLBO,This was a gift for my Mother.  She loved it.,1453248000,,45,3.5
8487915,3,B005WHFLBO,It was not as good as I had hoped.  Many of the other tattoos were better.  If you haven't seen others you would still like this one.  The pipes and drums are always good.,1417219200,,171,3.9705882352941178
8487916,5,B005WHFLBO,"In 1994 my husband and I made our second trip to the UK and, while in Scotland (one of my ancestral countries), we attended the Military Tattoo. What a thrilling and magnificent musical experience. Every year now I purchase the latest DVD of the Tattoo for my husband for Christmas. We now have a nice collection and greatly enjoy watching the latest one together. Even loaned them to our brother-in-law who is also of Scottish descent to enjoy.",1344729600,3,445,4.717948717948718
8487917,4,B005WHFLBO,"The opening Fanfare highlighting the completion of the much heralded new stands for the Tattoo has a distinctly rap or hip hop sound to it which fortunately is saved at the last minute by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the Royal Marines.  Of course its a good thing that the Tattoo has updated its seating.  I recall with fondness the old, creaky seats of yore.  Too bad they can't provide mini umbrellas as it often rains at the Tattoo as it certainly did when I first went many years ago.  The rain was visible in this years show and must have been fun for the bands!

The massed pipes and drums display is always first-rate although here too we see newer arrangements and faster tempo generally.  The tendency seems to be to play partial elements of tunes instead of the full versions for some reason.  I guess this crams more music into a fast paced massed display.  Still, I don't know why this is being done now.  Also, the tendency to have the bands march while playing reels and the like seems odd.  These were usually done at the halt.  The fact that the Royal Regiment of Scotland seems to be submerging the individual battalions within its organization may likely lead to a composite Army Pipes & Drums.  This would be a sad loss for the Tattoo because for many the Scottish regimental pipes & drums ARE the Tattoo.  Let's hope this will not be so.  Considering that this was the last year for senior Drum Major Brian Alexander I was surprised that there was nothing in the Tattoo special features highlighting has 24 years of service in the army as well as his time at the Tattoo.  This seems unfortunate and typical of the Tattoo's emphasis on the foreign acts while largely ignoring the army's contribution.

The Dutch Bereden Wapens (Mounted Arms) band formed from many old Cavalry and Horse Artillery bands always does a goofy bicycle Band display highlighting the fact that the Dutch had mobile bicycle units around the turn of the century. These must have had bands as well.  The band generally does the same kind of display at every Tattoo they go too.  They did the same back in Edinburgh in 2002.

The modern, semi Caribbean element which seems required at the Tattoo now is provided this year by the Band and Pipes of the Brazilian Marine Band. This band is a curious mix College and HS bands.  Way too much percussian and of course the usual shouting and jumping around.  The band does not showcase any martial tradition it is suppose to represent for Brazil's Marines.

The German Mountain Army Band seems to be making the Tattoo circuit a lot these days. They were just at the Virginia International Tattoo this year. Not since 1986 has there been a German Military band at the Tattoo. They march on to ""Kasier Jaeger Marsch"" before quickly dropping into snippets of various pop German Alpine sounds.

The Massed Tattoo Highland dancers always have a big modern Celtic number with lots of current sounds. These are a popular and innovative element in the Tattoo and marks its steady distraction from more traditional fare. The display this year has something to do with fishing and the sea.  The costumes are a bit odd.  The music a wee bit too modern.  Its usually better when they have say the band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland doing the music.  That band was in the Tattoo this year but seemed under-used appearing only in the final.

The Bereden Wapens Band always does an encore performance after doing their bicycle bit earlier on. They usually sport one of the uniforms of the former Dutch Cavalry or Mounted Horse Artillery bands. The music here is mix of modern brass band sounds highlighting some modern movie music.  It should be remembered that this is a brass or fanfare band.  There are not any woodwinds here as this was the case in the past with the former Dutch bands of this character.  No marches are played until they end when they march-off.

The Massed bands of the Royal Marines appear more frequently at the Tattoo these years thanks of course to fewer British army bands. They were last at the Tattoo in 2008. They march on to a classic RM March ""Per Mare Per Terram"" which is grand to hear again at a Tattoo. For a change the entire march is played before going into slow time with a beautiful modern arrangement form a movie or TV show. No RM Band display would be complete without their famous Corps of Drums. These have become more modern in recent years but they are still a delight to see.. This carries into ""Seafarers"" which is a clever arrangement of nautical tunes which seems to match the Tattoos theme for this year.

The Finale begins with a modern arrangement of an odd sounding piece of music ""How to Train Your Dragon"" which nonetheless beats hearing the standard ""Amazing Grace"" or Highland Cathedral"" again. There are some interesting sounds here and the massed pipes & drums join in for the last bit. This is large and rather grandiose piece which serves to bring on the cast for the finale.

The 2011 Tattoo marks the first production by Brigadier David Alfrey who takes the helm after Euan Louden who seems to have had enough after three previous productions. Though perhaps too soon to tell but perhaps Alfrey might be hinting at a more martial content for the Tattoo. We can only hope so. The DVD is rounded out with the usual behind the scenes material which pays most attention to the foreign acts and largely ignores the contributions of the British military bands.  This is unfortunate as these bands are constantly changing now and a little info.  about them would have been nice.  In particular developments with the Royal Regiment of Scotland would have been interesting to see as this umbrella organization is changing the five remaining battalions of the Scottish regiments within it.  They are becoming more generic and losing their older identities and traditions. If so this is a sad thing.

The new narrator for the BBC video seems nice, but this is the second change since the passing of the immortal Ian Flemming a few years ago.  For many he was the BBC voice of the Tattoo.  The DVD makes for a nice package, and while a bit pricy perhaps, its cheaper than actually going there!",1328054400,6,6168,4.632352941176471
