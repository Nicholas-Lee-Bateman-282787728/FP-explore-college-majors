7028381,4,B00U2YNLUU,I thought it was a good plot. It just seemed to become less believable about half way through when they started to introduce the other serial killers and it became a drama.,1443484800,3,172,4.40625
7028382,5,B00U2YNLUU,"This movie is great. It's defiantly intense and keeps you guessing. I definitely enjoyed this film all the way through! The acting is phenomenal and proves how you can have a main cast of young, fresh faced actors without sacrificing talent, charisma, or effectiveness. You can't help but feel sorry for Wayne Montgomery once you see his background and understand what made him so crazy.

Though it's a dark film, they creatively threw in a few hilarious one-liners, which really helped colorize the entire body of work. The story is very well written and orchestrated, keeping you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning!! I recommend buying this and watching every night! WellNot every night, but almost every night... okay, fine, well once per week at the very least.",1433635200,2,779,4.901515151515151
7028383,1,B00U2YNLUU,"Well, I'm almost speechless...this so-called film had to be one of THE worst that I have ever seen! I can't believe I wasted my time watching it, but I did. This ""docu-thriller"", as it's called, wasn't thrilling or even close to being a decent documentary, on a supposed prolific serial killer and his
""Followers"". It's really unfortunate, as well, because IF the writing AND the ""actors"" had been anywhere close to talented, it could've been really scary, thrilling and suspenseful! However, to me, it was none of those things. The story was so trite and stupid, I just kept hoping that somehow, it would get better, but that didn't happen!",1432857600,5,641,4.836363636363636
7028384,5,B00U2YNLUU,"This most surely is the most frightening movie I have ever seen. I thought it was a documentary, then googled it to find out more about it, and found it wasn't. This made me feel immeasurably better.",1483920000,2,199,4.405405405405405
7028385,2,B00U2YNLUU,"The actor portrayals come across as clearly scripted and unbelievable.

For a ""found footage"" fake-umentary to be effective, the performances have to be earnest enough make the viewer second-guess whether or not they are seeing fiction, and that doesn't happen here.",1480118400,,266,5.487804878048781
7028386,2,B00U2YNLUU,"Ummm....if there were ever a ""How To"" video of the arts and INCENTIVES (such as fame, and fans) of becoming a serial killer, this would have to be it!!! I find it pretty hypocritical that the makers of this film seem to find great delight in exploiting the murder of the author who was doing all of the book signings, and profiting from the""story"" of the serial murders, but then turn around themselves, and do the EXACT same thing (although obviously fiction). The aspect that STILL remains hypocritical, is regardless of whether or not this was fiction or not, it ABSOLUTELY GLORIFIES the roll of serial killer, and the details associated. My concern is for the lonely, beaten, abused and neglected teenagers out there, who might actually identify with these characters, and produce the SAME CONSEQUENCES of the fictional characters!!! What the heck were these people trying to accomplish with this????

The ONLY REASON I gave it TWO stars, (rather than the NEGATIVE ONES I'd have dished out if it were an option), is due to the predictable admission, it was a FAKE!! I sincerely HOPE teenagers (and beyond) realize with forensics and DNA in this day, the cases against serial killers, such as these, are solved with relative EASE, and maybe back in the 80's, these degenerates could elude law enforcement for some time, but today, when we have access to the type of investigative techniques we have discovered, there is little chance THIS many homicides could go overlooked by one or more individuals.",1479686400,,1504,4.898039215686275

7028392,2,B00U2YNLUU,"It's not a complete waste of time, but I do think that it is misleading. The film makers efforts would've been better spent telling a genuinely true story rather than orchestrating an elaborate fiction. Once I realized that this movie was fictitious, I turned it off. People who watch films within this genre are typically seeking to learn more about this subject. This movie has nothing educational to offer.",1474502400,,409,4.942028985507246

So for those of you incredibly distracted in your multi-tasking, this is a MOCK documentary style film. Acting was okay, storyline was okay, all just okay. I just know I wouldn't have watched this had I sooner realized this was not based on anything in reality. I prefer watching actual case studies for academic consideration/study and now I'm a sad knowing I wasted the time I had on it. Too morbid for me; there's something about a mock film presented in a documentary format that causes such a visceral reaction.

7028410,5,B00U2YNLUU,"Being a true crime/horror movie lover, I gave this one a shot.  I loved it!  Not really into the found footage sub genre of horror but this one blew me away. I googled Wayne and Andrea Montgomery since I had never heard of them.  There was no Wayne and Andrea who were serial killers.  This is a fake documentary that was very loosely based on Canada's Barbie and Ken killers, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka (not their crimes but the fact they video taped their crimes).  This is part 4 of a 4 part series.  Technically you don't have to watch the other 3 to understand what's happening as they show scenes from the other ones.  This is not for the faint at heart.

As a true crime buff, this movie caught my interest because I didn't recognize the serial killer.  After about fifteen minutes of excrement, I decided to skip to the end to find out how this monster was caught only to watch some twisted eulogy talking about his inspirational legacy.  After a little Google research, I found out that this is total fiction!  Really guys?  You might could pass this if as dark satire of media glorification of crime if serial killers like this made up guy weren't actually real.  More chilling, the legacies they inspire are also real.  Possibly even the legacies of made up serial killers like Wayne Montgomery.",1461542400,,755,4.8515625

What entertainment value is there in seeing a woman offer her family to a nut-job so they can also become killers or she and he will kill her children?  Where is the entertainment in listening to people begging for their lives, especially when one is a daughter?  There is no 'entertainment' value here, none, it just moves from one cringe-worthy and unbelievable moment to the next all the while being narrated by mind-rotten lunacy.

I don't know what sort of mind would think up with this sort of poison much less actually make it into a film; not one I want to know.  So, I guess this warning is finished because I am not willing to give this foul 'movie' another moment of my life.",1456617600,3,864,4.535483870967742

7028426,4,B00U2YNLUU,"This movie is more literally a Portrait of a Serial Killer than Henry in that it uses a mockumentary format with interviews and narration. It looks and sounds like a Crime Channel documentary, looking into the background and psychologies of not only each of the killers, but each killer's influences as children and in their current family. This goes way beyond standard slasher fare by bringing depth to the characters, giving them stories instead of stereotypes. An added dimension to this film is the cult-like following that the original killer develops, creating successors rather than copycats.

However, there are some weaknesses to the format and lack of budget. I'm not one who needs a lot of effects in movies, but the suspension of disbelief is spoiled by the killer's home videos that just feel, well, fake.  Paul McCloskey's performance as Wayne drives us through it, though. He maintains a detached, midwest inflection while speaking to his own victims like they were assembling a stereo instead of dismantling their bodies. He sounds crazy enough to be real.

Also, as the faux-documentary tells its story, it draws from a seemingly infinite reserve of audio and video tape from the characters' lives that just happens to capture all the relevant conversations, events and arguments that serve as major plot points.

Overall, this movie adds depth and atmosphere to the genre despite its production flaws.",1456531200,4,1420,5.134199134199134

7028448,1,B00U2YNLUU,"Seems to me if you're going to make a mockumentary, it's probably a good idea to at least feature ONE actor who can believably deliver realistic dialog. This movie is a perfect example of how a great thriller plot can be decimated by bad acting, editing, directing, and genre confusion. In the right hands, as a thriller, a compelling plot could have seriously delivered: psychopathic serial killer sees to his legacy. As it is, the film maker was unnecessarily infatuated with attempting to achieve a level of shock that only serves to add time to the movie (way too long). You really have to know--starting out-- if you intend to use intelligent suspense or blind horror blood and guts. Trying to do both is an epic fail.

The mommy-issue subtext may have been believable in a capable actress's hands, and she might have even achieved ""mediocre"" had the director been less focused on telling her not to blink, and more focused on how she delivered her lines. But that's the case with everyone in this film. They literally read the scripts and it's just... well... BAD.

My biggest beef is that I believe this movie probably started with a great script that was utterly perverted in production. I seriously get the feeling that this was a special effect's student's attempt to showcase his work, and that he invited the whole neighborhood to play a part in the movie Daddy funded. What stinks is that he probably bought  the script from a talented writer who likely wanted to END himself when he saw what this movie had done to his original work.

I cannot even BEGIN to cover what a shame this is, and the ways that this movie failed the writing, That's just tragic. It's what happens when bad film making takes liberties with good writing: it becomes a caricature of its own potential. As a viewer... that's frustrating.",1449446400,,1823,4.705329153605016

I gave 5 stars because the director/ writer Anthony Spadaccini did something that I personally had not seen before. I didn't realize until 3/4 (maybe a little bit longer) of the way into the film that it wasn't real (when I got curious and googled Wayne Montgomery). The time it must have taken to put this whole film together. Normally pseudo-documentaries look very scripted and polished but ""Head Cases"" was a lot different from others like the paranormal activity movies or Grave Encounters.

7028462,2,B00U2YNLUU,The movie was sooooo long. It seemed to drag on a little. I guess the movie was based on a real serial killer or something But the actual movie wasn't real? Barley could finish it,1444435200,,179,4.142857142857143
8704264,3,B00U2YNLUU,"Although disturbingly graphic, the sociopathy of the main character is well portrayed. Where this falls short however, is the development of the character through the lens of a criminologist. Most serial killers have a distinct M.O. that they adhere to throughout their killing tenure. This includes victimology and methodology. For example, Ten Bundy killed women that resembled like his ex-girlfriend by luring them to his car via a fake injury. The character of Wayne Montgomery seems to lack this. He seems to kill indiscriminately and crosses over gender boundaries. Although this does happen, it's safe to say it's rare. As a graduate student of Criminology, I found myself breaking down the plot as it developed. If Wayne Montgomery was a real killer, he would have likely killed women due to the parasitic relationship he has with his mother. Her obvious borderline personality disorder was the ""nurture"" end of the nature/nurture argument which aided in the eventual development of his psychopathic personality type.
If you want to watch a gory pseudo crime doc with no real connection points, tune in. If you're a genuine fan/student of true crime, like myself, save yourself from the unnecessary waste of 2 hours.",1526947200,,1224,5.186868686868687
8704265,1,B00U2YNLUU,"This looked scripted, not like a documentary. The ""serial killer"" seemed like a wannabe...he wouldn't scare me at all. He looked more like someone who watched Dexter and tried hard to make the pieces fit. I thought that by definition, a serial killer was secretive, manipulative, and intelligent. Not this guy. Nope.",1526256000,,316,5.096153846153846

Amazing how many people were involved with this man, and sick in their own right.  Scary comment in the end.  These people are everywhere.  Look at that quiet person who lives next door, and he just might be like Wayne.",1499040000,,351,4.492063492063492
8704268,3,B00U2YNLUU,"This strongly borderlines disturbing. It is extremely graphic. While it gives an interesting view into the madness, even for myself - a person who constantly watches crime/forensic/murder documentary type programming, I cringed quite a bit throughout this. Its a touch watch and a tough listen because there is quite a bit of obscene audio and video shared with the viewers.
I found comfort in knowing this is not a true story.",1490313600,,427,5.028169014084507
8704269,4,B00U2YNLUU,I believe that this film is better than a lot of other films of this genre.  I wouldn't say it was great but I did like it and the subject matter although a bit confusing between protege killers at times.,1489881600,,204,4.1
8704270,1,B00U2YNLUU,"I clicked on this absently thinking I was getting a documentary--and then I get this bizarre combination of disturbingly realistic 'found footage' and CLEARLY scripted first person interviews (the dude who plays the son is so clearly acting a script it's almost painful. The character of Andrea was far more convincing). It was so strange I stopped what I was doing to google what the hell I was seeing, because none of this was adding up. The google searches were rather vague, the results and suggested searches muddied by other distracted viewers who were as confused as I was initially.
If this were a true crime documentary, it would be incredibly problematic in its hedonistic depictions of murder and flagrant cruelty. As a movie, it falls far short of the mark. It is dark to the point of being almost unwatchable unless you are a fan of deliberate gore, and the subpar acting and scripting destroys any kind of immersion that would allow this story to be credibly told. Interesting (if dubious) idea, bad final product. Give this a pass.",1486857600,,1046,4.816666666666666
