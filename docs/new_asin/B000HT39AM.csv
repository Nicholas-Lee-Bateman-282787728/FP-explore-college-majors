8141118,5,B000HT39AM,"This DVD is a good  journal on a creative period in Bowie's life. It has a lot of people in the know giving evaluations of the events surrounding
the recording of three of Bowie's more adventurous records. One of my favorite musicians who almost got to record with Bowie is Michael Rother. He gives some pertinent information as well as the reason he never got to record with Bowie. If either of these records  (Heroes, Low, and Lodger) were favorites of yours, this is a must have documentary.",1489276800,,494,4.6022727272727275
8141119,5,B000HT39AM,I am grateful this exists. It is about the Berlin Trilogy. It is for Bowie fans who need more background.  It includes some wonderful clips of interviews and videos.,1452729600,,165,4.689655172413793
8141120,5,B000HT39AM,"David Bowie is one of the most influential and important artists of the 20th century (and beyond). His work in Berlin with Brian Eno was a critical advance in music both on a personal artistic level and in music history.

Then there's just the bizarreness of choosing to move to a city walled in by the Soviet Union.

And while Bowie gives up the elaborate dress and make-up, he trades it for the basic dress and understated make-up of a German Hausfrau.

This is a work of documentation and interpretation. If you are looking for insight into David Bowie's work at the time, this video provides what no other does.

It's not a concert or music video extravaganza - and there are plenty of those to satisfy us all.

But serious reporting about artists is rare, much rarer than musical performances, and can be of more value to the interested fan.

As the other reviewer said ""If you love the Berlin trilogy and want to learn about Bowie in a dry, mildly academic way then this is the disc for you.""

And for those who want that, it deserves 5 stars.

In a meta-review sense, one must wonder whether downgrading an item for not being what you wanted it to be, rather than being a poor example of what it is and was meant to be, is an appropriate choice.

I am on the side that says an item should be evaluated with regard to what it was meant to be. If it's not what you wanted it to be, well, it's not like you couldn't have found that out before buying it. So why write a critical review and give a low score just because you bought something you didn't really want?",1371686400,7,1567,4.320819112627986
8141121,3,B000HT39AM,"Many argue that Bowie was at his creative peak with the Berlin trilogy (Low, Heroes, Dodger).  This low-tech DVD examines the albums in depth, mostly with dry interviews about the circumstances around the albums.

There's little in the way of old video and the sound is mediocre.  It's mostly voiceovers with slow shots of album covers and academic style interviews with unfamiliar people.

There is some interesing content. For example, who knew V2 Schneider was an ode to Kraftwerk?

Sometimes it's hard to know where Bowie is coming from.  The DVD clears up some of his motivations and has some interesting details about his life and music creation process.

However, overall it's dull.  If you love the Berlin trilogy and want to learn about Bowie in a dry, mildly academic way then this is the disc for you.

If you want a movie that rocks with tons of classic video then look elsewhere.",1288742400,9,892,4.777777777777778
