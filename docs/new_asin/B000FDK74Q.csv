In the last few years, Catholic priests and nuns working with Mexican indigenous communities are creating a new synthesis of Christian and Mesoamerican traditions, called ""Teologia India"" (Indian Theology). Based on this synthesis, the Totonacs and other indigenous groups are organizing to claim their right to retain their traditions, and to take political power in their communities.",1196726400,3,1077,9.365384615384615
8598988,5,B000FDK74Q,"The Sierra Norte de Puebla, the Northeastern tip of the state of Puebla, is one of the most traditional and least developed areas in Mexico - home to indigenous Nahua, Tepehua, Otomi, and Totonac communities. This is ""Mexico Profundo"" - the ""Deep Mexico"" tourists - and urban Mexicans - never see: the Indian Mexico that has changed surprisingly little over the last 500 years.

The three films on this DVD are a window into this world. All are set in one Totonac Indian community, Huehuetla. Each film looks at a different facet of the community. ""The Tree of Life"" is a breathtakingly beautiful look at the ancient ritual of Los Voladores (the flyers), pictured on the front cover of the DVD. ""The Tree of Knowledge"" and ""Democracia Indigena"" examine the spiritual basis of the Totonac resistance to ""integration"" into mainstream Mexico. Taken together, these films belong in the collection of anyone who is interested in understanding Mexico.

But they are more than that. The films also show us a different vision of ourselves: a mirror to our own European roots, and to the very nature of spirituality. For their underlying theme is the spiritual integration of Mexican Indian and Judeo-Christian myth and ritual - not as separate and opposing belief systems, but as a single story, each part enriching and illuminating the other.

As Samuel Ruiz, the former Archbishop of Chiapas, put it: ""Fortunately Christopher Columbus did not bring God with him in his three caravels, for God was already present in the Indian Religions."" That's what these films are about.",1196467200,,1567,4.996168582375479
