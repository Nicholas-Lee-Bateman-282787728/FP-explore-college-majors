2963864,5,B000WAPBS4,"For the people who cannot read that it says European, that means it plays only UK (PAL) or Standard European (SECAM). Television in North America us NTSC'

Fletcher (Ronnie Barker) and his hapless cellmate Lennie (Richard Beckinsdale) was doing time -Porridge- in Slade Prison. Fetch has a give test stretch to do.

The fun happens when the prisoners try to get over on Mr. Mackay (Fulton Mackay). Doing Porridge meant a lot of time in your hands and getting Mr. Mackay in an uproar passed the hours.

Ronnie Barker is tremendous as Fletcher. His good nature combined with his desire for some of the finer things available in prison, legal or not, made for great viewing. Porridge, for those with multisystem DVD players and televisions is well worth the price.",1423699200,2,761,4.838461538461538
