8319664,5,B001LRTT9Y,"This hilarious movie is, if I detect aright the intentions behind it, a send-up of ""film noir"" (it even being filmed completely in black-and-white) and of those itty-bitty monster movies like the ""Critters"" (1-4), the seemingly endless ""Chucky"" series, ""Gremlins"" (1 & 2), and so forth. ""Truffe"" features a cinematic combination of eerie ""film noir"" and of sheer and utter grotesquerie. The nasty critters who crawl and squirm amok in it are wicked, talking minks (yes, minks!). These baneful beasties are concealed inside, and also furtively active outside, of human and robotic bodies, under remote mind-control by evil humanoid robots which are out to make some quick bucks through enslaving their human labour force to gather ever greater gobs of the world-class truffles. Those fungal delicacies suddenly have been proliferating in the soil of an underdog neighbourhood on the east side of Montr&eacute;al. These cinematic ingredients add up to a motion picture that is incredibly daft and very clever.

There is, however, a strong quotient of ""high camp"" high-jinks and sight-gags sprinkled throughout all of this, characteristic of a genre of humour that, admittedly, eludes many movie goers. The sight, in various scenes set at a lunch counter or elsewhere, of people devouring bowls of what surely looks, much of the time, to be ""poutine"" (the rather cheap-and-dreadful fast-food favourite in Qu&eacute;bec), with truffles added incongruously to poutine's other high-caloric ingredients, is among many purely visual jokes that abound in this movie. Truffles all over the place, but what often is served up to eat is truffles in the poutine?!?!? Yikes, this film really does take place in Qu&eacute;bec!

The yucks do not come along every few seconds, however, a restraint that helps to maintain the air of suspense and impending evil so typical of b&w ""film noir"" mystery and murder movies. Nonetheless, the results are so funny when the wackiness does come trolling in like the tides, that I had trouble stiflling my laughter in order for it not to hurt my ribs too much. The fact that the film was shot in that deprived Hochelage-Maisonneuve eastwards end of Montr&eacute;al, where I used to live (in the Maisonneuve part thereof) for over a decade during professional life in Montr&eacute;al, just endears to me all the more this weird wonder of a comedy.

There is no need for a detailed account here of the crazed plot. The IMDb (""Internet Database"") offers some help (very advisable to consult before viewing) to follow the film's screwy turns, as do(es) the review(s) posted there at the time (late March 2017) of accessing the IMDb entry. The cast, including a number of the big stars of Qu&eacute;bec's indigenous entertainment industry, is excellent and it is fun to see such provincial celebrities together in a gonzo context like this story!

The DVD edition viewed, in French with English subtitles for the ""theatrical version"", but not also, alas, for the ""director's cut"" alternative included on the same disc, is Seville Pictures 210043. Lots of amusement there is herein for those with a sense of fun and irony to bring to their viewing of this delightfully zany motion picture!",1493510400,,3204,5.132183908045977
8319665,2,B001LRTT9Y,"Unfortunately this film tries a bit too hard to be ""avant garde"" - think grown up ""Alice in Wonderland"" but with morel mushrooms.  Hallucinogenic at points, the story didn't hold my attention and I grew weary of trying to follow the inane plot. As talented as the cast is,  I had high hopes for some good ""black comedy"" as the DVD box promised.  I consider myself well read, open minded and even a bit artsy but this film just struck out for me.  It reminded me of a high school art project that the stoners might put together.  The uber violence at the end just seemed to say it all - kill me now....  barely made it to the end and when it was over I was left wondering if I could get the time back...",1367107200,4,702,4.125
