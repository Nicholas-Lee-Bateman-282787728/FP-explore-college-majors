1440548,5,B00005JL9A,"This film is wonderfully dark, yet faithfully portrays the various characters (all with unique motivations) as scared and desperate youths fighting for their very lives.  The premise is unique and it is well executed. The film isn't a ""gore-fest"". but rather could be seen as the loss of innocence in the most extreme circumstance.
If you have the opportunity to see this film, either by VCD, bootleg DVD or on screen at a Horror Festival, go!  You will not be disappointed.  You will find yourself frustrated that it is not available on DVD for Region 1.

Hunger Games is a definite cheap rip off of this. You could never match the intensity that this movie has. I do see that people don't like it because 'the book is better' but honestly never having read the book, the movie is great.

The manga was too sexually graphic, but take away that part, and it was a perfect way to flesh out the characters so you actually feel sad when they die.  The movie is not able to build stories around many of the characters, so when they die, there really isn't an emotional attachment.  But still a very well done movie.  Despite its flaws, I still give 5 stars, because it's easy to critique it after the fact.

1440689,4,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale is a movie that takes a high concept idea and doesn't hold back. Based on a best-selling book and with a movie released in 2000, film geeks were all talking about it. ""Kids put in a battle to kill each other?"" Who comes up with this stuff?

I watched this over a decade ago and recently watched it again. Obviously, with such a preposterous premise, I *had* to see this. I don't take pleasure in watching kids murder each other, but I had to see what the filmmakers were thinking. Being someone that doesn't have children (yet), I'm probably not as affected by this film compared to how a parent would.

The film starts off with a summary to explain how these events came to be so that you can suspend your disbelief. It's not an entirely convincing explanation, but whatever, let's get to the carnage! The kids are brought to an island, they are given weapons, and within three days time, the last one standing gets to go home. If two people are standing they will have to eliminate each other or both automatically die. How their deaths are triggered and all the rules of the game are explained by a delightfully cheery video tour guide.

The story does take itself rather seriously. There are violent bloody deaths, with the occasional dark humor throughout to contrast against that. On my first watch (and this is terrible to say but I am allowed to say it), all the kids kind of look similar. However, on a second watch, I was able to tell them apart. I mention this because there about 40-50 characters to start, and until they start thinning themselves out can you take the time to remember who the main players are.

Does this film have a message? I guess, don't piss off adults? Is it a good story? I thought it was rather thrilling in how it all played out. Do I suggest a watch? Definitely, but please know what you are about to get into. Let the battle begin! Recommend.",1476489600,,1896,4.471098265895954

1440695,5,B00005JL9A,"This movie is absolutely amazing.  Had heard about it because people mentioned it was similar to Hunger Games.  On some level it is, but there are very important differences.  A main difference is that in Battle Royale, the unwilling participants forced to kill each other are high school classmates who knew each other, not strangers.  They also are not trained killers and are randomly assigned a different tool or weapon, some of which are useless.  I found this premise much more interesting than the Hunger Games because the various characters react in many different but believable ways (don't want to reveal and spoil the movie) and prior relationships come into play in both good ways and bad and in ways you would expect in high school.  It's a huge psychological study and makes you think about what you would have done in their situation as well as others you know.  It also does not gloss over the violence, which in this case I think is important to show the savagery at play but does at times make it difficult to watch.  And the scene in the lighthouse is worth watching the entire movie for (reminded me of Reservoir Dogs).  I read that at one point before the Hunger Games they had considered remaking it for US audiences - glad they didn't as the power of the film is its rawness, and a sanitized Hollywood version would have ruined the message.",1465516800,3,1363,4.645833333333333

What a piece of garbage.  I wish I could get back these 2 hours of my life.  I see all the five star ratings and wonder if I am missing something.  Then  I am reminded of the song lyrics ""all the people tell me so, but what do all the people know.

The acting is awful.  I mean pathetic.

As some kind of futuristic cautionary tale, the premise is ridiculous.  As satire, the movie is pathetic.

I'm wracking my brain to come up with anything. . .  I mean anything, redeeming about this movie.  Nada.  Zippo. Zilch.

A huge chunk of the plot is different than the novel. It is too concise and some of the best scenes from the book were omitted or changed completely.
The book developed the characters of both protagonists and antagonists very well but the movie is so short it doesn't make you feel attached to a character.
The main character, Shuuya, is so annoying I kept hoping somebody will just end him.
I still can't believe how bad this is. It's like watching a car crash, it's so bad you can't look away.

1440856,5,B00005JL9A,"I remember when the ""Hunger Games"" movie came out, and everyone was stating that it was a rip-off of ""Battle Royale"", and while I enjoyed the ""Hunger Games"" books (well...the first two anyway), and the films (so far), I was interested in seeing where the comparison to ""Battle Royale"" came from. I guess there are some parallels, like kids fighting to the death on a remote island. There are also oppressive governments' in both films, but then then you could also toss ""Death Race 2000"" into the mix, and that film pre-dates both of these stories by decades, and this is hardly a ""new"" idea, there are tons of similar stories going back ages.

As ""Battle Royale"" begins we learn that Japan's government has become ineffective, and that children everywhere are rebelling against authority. In order to quell this uprising, the Battle Royale is created. Every year one class is taken to a remote location where they must fight to the death. They have 3 days to eliminate their classmates, and at the end of that time, if there is not one winner, then all will die. Each student has a tracking device necklace strapped around their neck, and if at the end of three days, there is no winner, the necklace will explode.

There are a few attempts at character development, but it's not like they are fully fleshed out. There is a bit more gore in this film, and a few scenes where the brutality is pretty wicked, but if you are hoping for exploitation or a shock film, you may be disappointed. Overall, I'm glad I finally got around to renting this off of Amazon, but don't think it's a film I'll re-visit, so I'll pass on buying the DVD.

***REVISION*** I have to say that I wanted to come back and correct what I had initially written about this film. I originally gave this film 3 stars after my first viewing, and what you've read above was my initial impression. After writing this review, I realizes something, I kept thinking about ""Battle Royale"", at odd moments my mind would return to particular scenes and I would find that song which plays over the end credits running through my head. Last night I decided to give this film another try, and maybe it was my mood the first time around, maybe I was looking for something different....I don't know? But ""Battle Royale"" is a shockingly fun movie. The overall theme is quite disturbing, and the film just pulls you in. Even after my first poor impression, something about the film stayed with me, and to me that's a sign of a good, if not great movie.",1424217600,,2504,4.572383073496659

1440975,5,B00005JL9A,"If you ever wondered what might have inspired the Hunger Games, look no further than Japanese cinema.  Battle Royale is the story of 42 ninth graders who are stuck on a remote island and told that only one of them will be able to leave so long as all others are killed.  Each student receives a backpack with a few survival supplies and a weapon.  There also happens to be a three day limit or the collars they're forced to wear will explode, causing the remaining survivors to perish.

As a commentary on society and what might happen if things get out of control, the movie doesn't really dig in that much.  It's mentioned in the beginning that society is falling apart and the youth of Japan are revolting.  Battle Royale is created as a way of quelling the rebellion, maybe.  Mostly the focus is on the humanity of several of the contestants and the things that connect them to each other as well as the outside world.  It's a bit violent and sad, but then, so have their lives been.

I wouldn't say the film is strong on allegory, but it does say something about what we are and are not willing to do for ourselves as much as each other depending on upbringing and how much there is to lose in the process of the battle.  You'll think, maybe be entertained, and certainly wonder what's the point of it all.  it's easy to see why the film is both controversial and beloved.  Life is a battle after all, and there's something we can all relate to in this film.

So, I think they gave her ""star"" credit after-the-fact, to cash in on her ""Kill Bill"" fame (though, I admit, she is a well known actress and model in Japan).

Although there are striking similarities between the two (a group of teenagers pitted against each other on a secluded island, casualties are announced over a loudspeaker), the two are executed in completely different ways. The only aspect The Hunger Games can flaunt over BR is its more developed reasoning behind the 'games' and a firm root in politics. In every other way, Battle Royale is better and more enjoyable. It has the tone of an 80's kids fantasy, like The Goonies or Gremlins, and although it features a bunch of kids brutally murdering each other, the goal is not to sicken the audience. The violence is broken up with bits of humor, mostly dealing with juvenile crushes, and a classical score that brings a certain flippancy to the material. Compared to The Hunger Games, the characters are more believable as kids because of there references to cliques, crushes, and the fantastic flashback/dream sequences that shed light on their consciences. The convincing performances from the entire cast contribute to this immensely. Despite the constant killing, Battle Royale is a non stop thrill ride that never once sags or becomes monotonous. Each kill is unique in its own way. The film doesn't really have time to meditate on the deaths themselves, which is good because if the weight behind every single death was measured, the film would be 3 hours long and a lot less fun. Instead, the pacing is perfect and Battle Royale remains a genuine adrenaline rush from beginning to end. Watching it, it's kind of hard to believe that it was made in the year 2000. Director Kinji Fukasaku shot it like it was made in the mid-to late 70's, with lots of dolly shots, hand-held shots, and long zooms. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but the whole film gives off a retro-vibe. Perhaps it's the color tone. Whatever it is, it makes Battle Royale feel like a long lost classic.

*NOTE THIS IS BASED ON THE UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION OF THE FILM

Battle Royale (2000) is a Japanese film from Kinji Fukasaku. The film revolves around 42 students chosen from a class that are under the impression of going on a ""study trip"". However it soon becomes clear that it is more then that. The students quickly are told that they have been chosen to participate in the annual ""Battle Royale"" where 42 students are forced onto an island or other piece of area with 3 days to kill each other until only one remains. Personally, I adored this film. It is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time with it's gritty story, violent images, and strong character morals in the film. Throughout the film we soon learn who will participate and who will not. 2 students, Named Kiriyama Kazuo and Mitsuko Souma, decide to partake in the game and kill until they are the only ones left. Kiriyama, is just down right insane. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants and kills plenty people throughout the film. Mitsuko on the other hand, is insane but is emotionally insane and we find sympathy for her later on. While they decide to play three kids, Kawada a former victor, and Shuya and Noriko, 2 friends trying to survive, try rallying up as many students to escape the island.

The acting in the film varies from character. The top 4 actors that stood out for me were: 4.) Chiaki Kuriyama. She plays the self-centered Chigusa Takako who thinks of her best friend in time of need, and when she fights, oh she does fight. The courage of this girl and the way the actress matched her character from the book, is amazing.  I would say that this film was her ""breakout role"", since she later starred in films like ""Kill Bill"" by Quentin Tarantino. 3.) Takeshi Kitano. This man plays the 7th grade teacher of the students. Whether he is making extremely dark jokes to the class when they are killing each other, or giving a speech to his daughter, he delivers the lines which such perfection and a matching tone. 2.) Tatsuya Fujiwara. This young man plays Shuya Nanahara, one of the protagonists of the film. Save your tissues for this guy because when he plays the crying scenes, it extremely convincing. He also matched the sympathetic Shuya from the book. For a teenager at the time of filming, he obviously had a future in acting. And finally 1.) Kou Shibasaki or known as the sexually-violent and beautiful Mitsuko Souma. Words cannot describe the acting of this girl. And I mean that in a good way. Whether it is happiness from killing someone, being disgusted by sympathy, or being a plain out bitch, this girl can play anything you give her. In the end, though killing all those people, you can't help but feel sympathy for her and maybe a very large contributing factor was the actress herself. Later, Kou became a successful J-pop singer, offered a role in ""Kill Bill"" as well, a role in ""Chakushin Ari"" and ""47 Ronin"".

In the end, ""Batoru Rowairu"" is an over-the-top violent film, that teaches you some lesson, leaves you in tears and wanting more. Before ""The Hunger Games"", ""Battle Royale"" was slashing away (with a sickle). If you want a great j-horror, thriller, action movie then this movie is for you.",1398729600,,3436,4.580487804878048

Their is little character development and a lot of it is done through flash backs after the character has already been killed. I have heard from friends of mine that are fans of the film that the creator of this film and the book it was based on wanted to show horrible things that were done to him and other children by the adults in his life. this film came of (to me!) as lack luster with very little emotion sometimes to the point where the characters seemed almost robotic or devoid of humanity. A lot of people compare this to the Hunger games series, which I am not a fan of either.  Battle Royale's setting and world defiantly makes more sense as compared to the Hunger Games, but the Hunger Games seems to have more believable characters with actual human emotions. Like I said maybe it was lost in the translation but for me it just didn't cut it.  pick it up if you want, defiantly worth a watch.

For example the reason for having the annual death game, the way the game is conducted, who is behind it and what their motive is, and the strategies and outcome are all dissimilar. So, Battle Royale should be evaluated on its own merits.

The story really speaks to the pitiful state of Japan's public school system, the lack of discipline, the disrespectful children bullying and breaking rules and often laws without the fear of punishment at school or at home. To me, the entire movie is a Japanese teacher's dream - unruly and unworthy students atoning for their misbehavior in a bloody game of death. Lord of the Flies psychology kicks in after the kids realize their dilemma. Some pair up, others form groups, while a few go solo.

The weakness of the story is a lack of background. The characters are not very well developed, including the punitive teacher hosting the event and having too many unanswered questions is more annoying than interesting.

The strength is in the original theme and fascinating cultural-anthropological look at a ""Hello Kitty"" society reverting back to bloodier times.

What follows is a incredibly wild and crazy journey as the students of a lucky class are pitted against each other to survive. Who can you trust, who is going to crack, who is going to make it? The story keeps you engaged seeing just what will happen to everyone, and trust me when I say it is far more brutal and graphic than what you'll see from the Hunger Games movie that came out.

First off if you truly want to be able to compare them do it based on the books not the movies because, while I like BR the movie, it really can never compare to the book. The book is one of my favorite books ever! Since this is about the movie not the book, here goes. The movie is well done, thought provoking and still gets the point of the book across, no movie can ever touch the book it is based on. It is a touching story about children forced into a situation because their government fears them. You get to be with each kid as they are going through this situation, you get to see their past and their last moments. The story does a good job of making you feel for them, question authority, question allegiances. The hunger games is about a girl who questions authority by accident, she becomes a symbol for a starving society. BR gives everyone a chance to tell their story where as the Hunger games tells one girls story. Both are interesting stories but the comparisons people are making aren't always relevant. Read the books, watch both movies then we can compare. If you are basing it off the movies you aren't getting the whole picture. The books are much more complicated.

Bad special effects you say?  Of course not, just watch ""Sanjuro"", or other classic Japanese movies (see Comments section below for YouTube links).  The master, Akira Kurosawa,  demonstrated this aspect of the Japanese in his movies.  Probably that's why they lost WWII.

1441204,4,B00005JL9A,"As the Amazon editor rightly puts it, Battle Royale sets the stage for The Hunger Games. I have seen the Hunger Games before I have seen Battle Royale and the similarities are way too strong between the two movies I have to agree that the Hunger Games does feel like an American remake to Battle Royale.

What makes Battle Royale interesting is the fact that violence is forced upon the teenagers, or rather teenagers are forced to use violence upon each other in order to survive. Most violence movies have adult characters. And those adult characters mostly have criminal intent and exercise their free-will to commit the crimes. Battle Royale creates a setting where teenagers are thrown into a situation where they are forced to kill one another in order to survive. I have to admit that teenage Japanese girls shooting at each other violently does create an unprecedented spectacle in the action-violent genre.

I think Battle Royale makes a strong social commentary about the violent trends among youngsters today and how the tough competition pushes them towards eliminating each other violently.

However, the movie is not without its flaws. I am specially disappointed by the colors in the movie. I picked up the Blu-ray expecting a great picture quality. The colors are flat, almost non-existent. There is almost no contrast. The poor color saturation takes away from the visual style of the movie. As for the plotline, I have never understood the reason for Battle Royale act. How is Battle Royale act supposed to help the country ? That is never explained in the movie. I am sure most fans know since they read the book. Another criticism would be the relations between characters are not established in the beginning. I think the book does a better job of developing the relations between different characters. But then again, this is something for the fans who read the book can confirm.",1360540800,,1901,4.91588785046729
1441205,4,B00005JL9A,"Thematically, the three movies deal with normal social order breaking down under different types of pressures.  In LOTF, the catalyst was an air crash leaving prep school boys to fend for themselves on an island.  Two camps emerged ... one responsible and one hedonistic.  The clashes were inevitable.  Prior normal rivalries, became exaggerated by a need to survive and a need to lead at all costs.

Hunger Games' catalyst was from outside not within.  The abnormal social dynamic was a created organized event in a dystopian society.  The participants knew in advance what the challenges would be.  There was no previous tight social group among the participants.  That had to be created on the run literally.  Since this was a fight to the death, any social connections made were temporary, loose, and designed for personal survial not any need for restoring a social order.

Battle Royale preceded Hunger Games by 6 years.  Unlike the other two movies based on books, BR was an original screenplay.  Culturally, it had some slight differences due to the Japanese inherent focus on a social order based on uniformity and conformity.  Oddly, BR is the most over the top of the three movies approaching a B class guilty pleasure movie.

The classic social breakdown here is again from the outside.  A law is passed which requires picking a specific class in a specific school to have a fight to the death in an unknown setting.  But the catalytic breakdown itself is more like LOTF since there was an existing but seriously dysfunctional social order within the class.  Not surprising.  The BR law was the result of Japanese society rejecting growing violence among their young.

BR moves fast and the confrontations are more graphic.  However, it has the feel of an anime' film in the level of stereotypical characters and the style of action.  I enjoyed this film not as a classic statement on anarchic societies but as a guilty pleasure movie.

If you want a more serious film, watch LOTF, the original not the disappointing remake. I found the Hunger Games the Twilight version of social breakdown movies. Well crafted but just nothing that feels compelling for me to watch with interest.  Too syrupy.

I'd recommend BR not that it is a great movie in the artiste sense but as that better than average action movie with some irony and more interesting characters albeit barely developed characters since the kills come fast.  It is noted that this is a top ten film in Japan and received great notoriety there when it opened.  While social conformity is important the idea of middle schoolers being chosen to kill each other off to somehow reduce violence levels among the worst school kids is particulalry offensive to their culture.  I find that view a bit dated. In reality, their biggest problem is not enough younger people in a very aging population.  More young not less is a goal. But so is a wish to retain the traditional respect for order, appreciation of their culture, education, and respect for elders. Possibly the shock was not so much about violent young as it was dealing with conflicting generational views between yound and old.",1360454400,3,3153,4.87406015037594

1441211,3,B00005JL9A,"Don't get me wrong I found this interesting enough to sit through all of this subtitled movie, but it was after all a great deal like hunger games with a Japanese twist.  In the near future the Japanese are fed up with revolting students and create a law to deal with them.  Of course in this case most of the students are innocent but that doesn't seem to matter.  They choose a class of about 70 students and send them off to kill each other on a remote island.  Each gets a pack with food and a weapon.  Some of those weapons are a pair of binoculars and another a pot lid.  However some get numbchucks, knifes, and even pistols and machine guns.  Now if you like either Japanese movies or other cultural movies, you will probably enjoy this movie.  The movie is pretty decent most of the time, but like most movies of this type they get cheesy, hammy, and generally full of themselves preaching mistakes of society, how students and teachers are treated, and kids just don't appreciate what they have from time to time.

1441243,3,B00005JL9A,"Synopsis: a group of teenage schoolkids are taken to an isolated island by a totalitarian half-fascist, half-communist government and forced to kill each other until there is only one left alive.

The violence is very graphic, and this is a contrast to The Hunger Games; this is due to the different genders writing each books. It is always difficult to render a proper adaptation of a very large book with a large number of characters, but even so, there are ways. Unfortunately, the director fails to do a very good job at that. Sometimes even the camera angles are wrong in that they fail to capture a character's reaction at the proper time, opting instead for wide angles. Another thing, I had no emotional connection with most of the characters, even the main ones; frankly, I didn't care if they lived or died, I just wanted to see the action. Granted that the book went into greater detail about them, the director could have easily worked something in in order to establish empathy.

I have another criticism, one that also applies to the book and that consists in that although several of the characters sustain injuries, they nevertheless undertake physical activity which would be strenuous in normal circumstances. I guess that incongruity can be written off as the stamina of youth and/or adrenalin, but even so, it felt unreal.",1356998400,,1342,4.85589519650655

1441249,1,B00005JL9A,"I read The Hunger Games, then watched the first movie. Loved them all. I set out to watch Battle Royal because I heard it was, essentially, the ""first"" Hunger Games. The two bare no similarity aside from young adults killing each other, and I really don't understand the appeal of Battle Royal. It severely lacks the social and political commentary that gives The Hunger Games such a solid foundation, and instead focuses almost exclusively on death, violence, and ludicrous melodrama.

The story is nearly non-existent and the reason for having students battle each other to the death is flimsy at best (unemployment too high? Let's just throw a bunch of kids on an island and have them kill each other, that makes sense right?). Most of the characters look similarly to each other and it doesn't help that they all wear the same school uniforms, but no matter, there's nearly 40 of them and most have precious little screen time before some ridiculously gruesome death, so if you get them confused with each other it really doesn't matter much.

The whole thing is just completely preposterous, and there isn't even the visceral feeling of survival. One of the characters is just some batsh-t insane kid who carries an uzi and unloads thousands of rounds throughout the course of the movie, and I think I saw him reload his gun once when it was convenient to give one of the characters an opening to attack. It completely loses any sense of realism and feelings for survival when the bullet count is as high as a Schwarzenegger film, despite there being only a handful of guns (seriously, the amount of rounds dispersed he would have to be carrying 2-3 dufflebags filled with nothing but clips of ammo).

But perhaps even worse is the melodrama, which is even more copious than the blood splatters. Every single character had to monologue during their death scene about how much they loved such and such student. It just feels so forced and hollow. They couldn't bother to have any characterization prior, so instead they choose to force some half-assed romance during their death scenes to show you how sad it is. But it just comes off feeling awkward and ridiculous.

And even worse than that, this small group of students devised a clever plot to escape. Then they get gunned down. That ends that. What was even the point of that side story?

The movie also has one of the most absurd deaths I've ever seen. A character gets shot, stands up like it's nothing, sits down on a couch, answers his phone and speaks as if nothing is out of the ordinary, and then dies immediately after that. I was seriously wondering if this was some bizarre attempt at nihilistic humor or something, because if it was meant to have some kind of poignancy it was completely lost with horrendous acting and just awful execution. I haven't felt so awkward watching a movie since the ""NOOOOOOOOO"" scene in Star Wars Episode III.

I couldn't even enjoy this movie in a ""so good it's bad"" context, because it actually attempted to have some amount of social and political commentary at the beginning of the movie. It set me up similar to The Hunger Games, but by the end it just felt like a poorly executed slasher flick.

Ultimately, Battle Royal is a case of injecting a small amount of artistic integrity into what is otherwise a pure exploitation flick as a flimsy excuse for justifying all the bloodshed and violence.",1353283200,6,3401,4.715488215488215

One would not automatically, without questioning, abide by the rules of the savage game and kill their friends.
The movie does not flow. One fraction of the students found a loophole and a way to eliminate the true enemy, however ""coincidently"" happened you die straight after.

1441278,2,B00005JL9A,"My opinion of this movie is based off the movie, not the books. Not ""historical significance"". Not ""my Uncle was in this!"". Just what I saw on the screen 15 minutes ago.

The premise was a bit odd.
The ""world"" background was totally left out (seems like it was supposed to be a modern day Japan) so it seems odd that the adults decided to toss a bunch of unruly teens -by unruly I don't mean murderers or rapists, just kids who didn't seem to like ""respecting their elders"", although in Japan, maybe that's worse than murdering or raping your parent... - onto an island to kill each other off. At least Running Man had a whole world built around it so the suspension of belief was much more attainable.

The action wasn't anything special. No cool moves or creative effects (although for the time the addition of the post production blood spray - much like what you see in The Expendables now - might have been ground breaking). All pretty standard to sub standard. The Uzi of unending ammo got real annoying after awhile (he did change clips once but that was for drama - yhea yhea, showing all the clip changing is boring and uninteresting so they just edited those out, right? All, say, 15 of them? how heavy was that backpack in the first place!? btw it was amazing how much his ability with that thing varied).

The movie was more about the relationships between the students than anything. That's where most of the screen time went and creative writing. But if that's what you're into, go check out The Breakfast Club before getting this. Personally, I didn't care if any of them lived...or died, really. Of course, I'm not a 16 year old Japanese student, either, so who am I going to relate to? The only two ****incoming spoiler, kinda**** I was glad got it was Ms Psycho chick (with the sickle) and the Uzi guy (just so he'd stop firing that damn Uzi).

1441281,5,B00005JL9A,"This is a story about a class of Japanese students who are dropped on an island and forced to battle to the death.  It was an influence for Quentin's Kill Bill movies, and anyone who's a fan of those must absolutely have to see this movie as well.  I'm aware that it's also drawn comparisons with the Hunger Games, but I'm not sure that's fair.  They have similar concepts, but they're different stories and have different points to make.  And Battle Royale itself isn't the first ""Fight to the Death!"" type of story anyway, but it sure is one of the best.

Now this is a gory little story.  In fact, it's been banned in some countries for violence.  Kids are shooting and cutting each other up, and pretty much everyone's covered in blood by the end.  Personally, I wasn't that shocked by it, but I watch a lot of violent movies.  Make no mistake, this is no simple gore-fest.  This is actually a very human story.  You see all the emotions these characters are going through as they're thrown into this intolerable situation.  This movie exposes the worst humanity has to offer, but it also shows some of the best.  Believe it or not, my sister actually said, ""Aw, that's so cute"" multiple times while watching this.  For every character trying to murder their best friend, there's another sacrificing himself for his high school crush.

I'll admit I haven't read the book, so I can't say how the movie compares to it.  I've read another reviewer say Kiriyama is underdeveloped compared to his presentation in the book.  That'd be a shame, cause he's a total badass in the movie, and a real-life example of what I like to call ""main character hair.""

Unless you're very squeamish when it comes to violence, you need to see this movie.  It's twisted, demented, and full of action, but it's also very thought provoking.  I can't wait for the day when high school teachers start showing this to students in the classroom.  ""Don't misbehave now children, this could happen to you.""",1348012800,,1979,4.629310344827586

1441323,4,B00005JL9A,"I heard this film served as the basis for THE HUNGER GAMES, so I was curious to see yet another Asian film that inspired American films (like THE DEPARTED based on INFERNAL AFFAIRS).  The premise of this Japanese film is pretty much the same as the American reincarnation.  A group of kids are sent to compete for their lives under the whip hand of their former teacher (ably played by Beat Takeshi, the actor who recently was Zatoichi, the blind swordsman).  Over forty of the kids are supposed to be cut down to a single survivor, but two ""ringers"" are thrown into the mix, two who had gone through a similar experience in the past and are more than capable of taking care of themselves and killing others.  A long and bloody sequence of elimination then takes place, while some of the kids find love among themselves and possible salvation.

Human interest in certain characters comes and goes as they are featured and then dispatched.  Some characters evoke sympathy, others evoke loathing.  The conclusion is not all that neat and tidy, as if anything like this plot could ever be. Asian films resist proverbial Hollywood endings. Still, it is fascinating to watch if only to see how over forty kids would be whittled down.  I was reminded of that old Agatha Christie novel upon which several movies were based -- AND THEN THERE WERE NONE or TEN LITTLE INDIANS.  The drama consisted of seeing how people were going to get knocked off, who was going to leave the screen, who was going to survive (if any), and how the movie would end.  Overall, I regard this as a superior genre film for action oriented viewers; it's violent and bloody, yes, but nothing like the SAW movies wallowing in horror and gore.",1347408000,,1708,4.644518272425249

1441327,3,B00005JL9A,"I was happy to watch this film because, as a fan of the Hunger Games books, I have been told dozens of times that they are merely a sanitized ripoff of Battle Royale.  Having seen them both, I don't think that the one influenced the other.  Like many have said, there is a long tradition, going back to the gladiators, of people being forced to kill other people for sport.  And the hunting aspect strongly smacks of The Most Dangerous Game.  I enjoyed Battle Royale very much, mostly because it was a lot funnier than I thought it was going to be.  The video explaining the rules, was fantastic, that whole scene was very funny- I could watch that over and over.  But I'm not sure it was intended to be funny, but the over-the-top, flat acting, just made what should have been tense and terrifying, actually loud, chaotic, and campy.  And unlike the Hunger Games, were you have children being sacrificed in a ritual slaughter where half the horror comes from the foreknowledge: the reaping, every year thinking about what might happen, then being chosen, knowing what is going to happen to them while the rest of society is observing, encouraging and celebrating the horror- no such tension exists in Battle Royale.

The world of Battle Royale the film is much simpler.  To the point of inanity.  The children are bad, disrespectful, the old do not like the young,  therefore the government is going to secretly kill a few teenagers.  I don't understand the goal of the Progam, the endgame, really.  In Hunger Games, there was a purpose, punishment for rebellion and a reminder of the central, absolute authority: everyone had to watch.  It affected all society.  No one sees what happens on the island in Battle Royale, not even the people RUNNING IT (it is a seriously low-tech distopian torture game), and the students, while they seem aware that Battle Royales have happened in the past, are sufficiently in the dark that none of them seem to know what is going on, even after they have been kidnapped and told this is Battle Royale.  They are like, what, what are you asking?  So in this society, it isn't even serving its purpose as...I don't know what.  Whatever the point of the Program, it sucks, because clearly no one is getting the message.  They need to advertise.  And get some professionals in there.  The teacher that runs it seems clueless.  Apparently the kids teased him (one even randomly stabbed him in the leg 2 years ago, but this is the kind of authoritarian society where the kid wasn't punished, WTF?), so now, he's going to watch them die with gleeful commentary.  He is also apparently primarily motivated by a snotty disrespectful teenage daughter who isn't on the trip.  (Again, clearly The Program is not effective)  Actually, he is pretty funny.  But the premise is insane, and not at all scary, or haunting, or thought provoking, because it is so stupid.

The violence, however, is the best part.  It is bloody to the point of absolute camp.  They show every death, so I guess that is what people mean when they described it as ""not watered down.""  Except that you don't really care that they are dying. The characters are, needless to say, static, more caricatures than characters, they don't get a chance at any sort of development.  You watch one fall after the other and what you are really hoping for is that they die in an interesting manner. And they do.  Because in covering 40 deaths, there is about 30 seconds worth of character development -for most of them seconds after they are introduced and mere moments before they die.  It usually goes, confess secret love to girl/boy you've barely spoken to as you die, or he dies, and then, survivor gets shot/stabbed.  Repeat.  The girls are worthless, they are either sheep or, if they actually decide to fight, portrayed as total sociopaths.  The ""heroine"" of the piece is literally carried through the movie by male after male after male declaring his willingness to die for her.  No reason, of course, I guess because she's pretty.  Girl power.

The boys are more interesting.  This was a fun new aspect of the Program, we never really got to see contestants plot their way out in the Hunger Games, because that hunt had the additional element of tributes being hunted by the game masters and constantly on camera-but in Battle Royale, it is a budget torture, they don't televise or even observe it, so you get to watch all sorts of strategies, by the boys.  These run the gamut from sheep, to sociopath, to noble hero trying to find secret love of his life, to covert resistance fighters.  All in all, they were pretty good.  But still not enough time to care about them so that you were really sad if they died.  I watched like 40 people die in Battle Royale and didn't care half as much over that bus full of kids as I did over one death in the Hunger Games.  The violence and the acting in Battle Royale is so over the top, the motives so simplistic (You teased me, now DIE!), that you honestly don't care if these kids live or die.  Which is good, because they die like, every 5 minutes.  The pacing is beautiful, which is good, it keeps you from trying to think too hard about the weaknesses in the plot.

It is, however, super-entertaining.  Funny, violent, well shot- every sadistic smile or high pitched girly fit.  But it isn't the pointed social commentary everyone told me it was.  It left me chuckling, not wondering ""wow, what would I do?""  Maybe they develop something, anything really, more in the book.  Especially the POINT of all of this.  The most affecting image in the film is the first 2 minutes, when they show the outcome of the previous Battle Royale.  The smiling girl with her blood drenched sailor-style school uniform and baby doll.  It implied a sense of public awareness about the Program, like it might inspire national fear.  But none of the kids seems scared in the flashbacks, they ditch school happily and stab their teacher in the leg with immunity, so I'm still puzzled as to the point of all this glorious violence.  But glorious it is, and you should totally watch it.",1346716800,2,6102,4.638992537313433

1441331,3,B00005JL9A,"In an alternate world of modern day Japan, the younger generation has no respect for adults or for law and order.  Those in charge of the government decide, for purposes of elimination and example, to select a 9th grade class each year to kill each other.  Only one survivor or they all die thanks to an exploding device attached to their neck.

The leader in charge, assisted by scores of military accomplices, is in fact a teacher (Takeshi Kitano) at the school whose class is picked.  His brutality is evident in the orientation before the 42 kiddies are released into a remote island interior.  When one girl smarts off to him he tosses a knife into her forehead.  When one kid, who had for whatever reason, stabbed Kitano in the butt earlier at school, talks back, his necklace is activated.  Now only 40 to go!  Kitano does have some teacher pets however, which comes into play later.

The concept for this film is a pretty good one.  Life or death.  No exceptions.  No mercy.  Each participant is given personal supplies and a bag of survival gear.  Some have automatic weapons, others have seemingly innocuous items.  One kid has a large lid to a cooking pot.  It comes in handy.  The action moves along quickly as each kid meets his or her doom, usually with extreme violence.  Some is pretty juicy but nothing as extreme as you might see on ""True Blood"" or ""Spartacus.""

Having seen many Japanese films, going back to those made in the 1940's, I find cultural differences hinder their acceptance to most Western audiences.  Much of this difference carries over into their filmmaking.  In almost every situation where one kid takes out another, hysteria follows.  One kid and one of the ""heroes"" named Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara), weeps uncontrollably after every death.  His girlfriend, Aki (Noriko Nakagawa) has more character and is one of the few sympathetic kids in the hunt.  My favorite character is Mitsuko (and the film's only good performances by Kou Shibasaki), who we see in a flashback (originally cut) being coaxed into sex as a child.  Her mission is clear.  Kill or be killed.

The film is full of over-the-top-acting by nearly everyone except Shibasaki and Kitano.  It gets old.  Contrary to what many believe, this isn't the first film to feature people hunting people (""The Most Dangerous Game"" from 1932) or even kids killing kids (""Lord of the Flies"" from 1963) and it wasn't the last (""The Hunger Games"" from 2012).  It is a good, if flawed film.

I watched the film on a Director's Cut Blu ray disc which looks very good.  The film is in 1080p and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The video doesn't sparkle, primarily because the film has a toned down look.  All the combatant kids wear muted tan uniforms with white shirts under their jackets.  The blood splatters look pretty realistic both when it's fresh and when it dries.  The picture is clear and without aritfacts.  I watched the Japanese language version with English subtitles.  It is a really terrific Dolby TrueHD 7.1 mix.  Every speaker include the LFE channels will come to life, especially with the heavy automatic weapon gunfire scenes.  For those who prefer an English dub it is available as Dolby TrueHD as well but with a 5.1 mix.",1345507200,,3222,4.745487364620939

1441357,4,B00005JL9A,"Long before ""The Hunger Games"" but after ""Lord of the Flies"" there was ""Battle Royale,"" a Japanese survivalist horror show in which middle school teenagers are forced to murder each other. That's the first hint that ""Battle Royale"" is different from ""The Hunger Games"" - ""Battle Royale"" begins like a nightmare, with children waking up from a field trip terrorized by their sadistic teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano). The little exposition provided at the beginning of the film explains that the Battle Royale (BR) Act was instituted after 800,000 students walked out of school.

The precise details of the BR Act (along with the society that generates it) is a little fuzzy, but the end result is that middle school classes are randomly chosen to wear explosive collars and murder each other until only one remains.  ""Battle Royale"" definitely has some cultural peculiarities that don't translate well to an American audience.  I would think 800,000 students would have to do more than ""walk out of school"" to merit a battle to death.

But enough details! ""Battle Royale"" is most interested in the battle royale and the action starts almost immediately as the students shift from confused whiners to vicious killers.  The class of 40 students rapidly narrows as they commit suicide and murder, all against the backdrop of Japanese middle school drama.  Imagine American high school cliques armed with machineguns and you get the idea.

In addition to the 40 students, there are two ringers: one is a murderous psychopath who volunteered for the game; the other is a survivor from a previous game with a dark past. From the zones that threaten to detonate the bomb collars just by straying into the wrong territory (this never actually comes into play in the movie for some reason) to the fact that each student's survival pack is randomly assigned - some without weapons - there is little hope for any of them.  And so each pocket of children plays out a different morality play where, bereft of adult authority and a moral compass, they regress to the laws of Japanese middle school.  There's the star-crossed lovers, the pleasantly facile cheerleading squad, the hacker brotherhood, the bloodthirsty nerd outcast, the bullying jocks, and the sociopathic loner. Not all of these survival strategies are as successful in the social circles of school as they are on the battleground, and director Kinji Fukasaku has fun playing the grim drama out for our amusement as the kill counter clicks down with each death.

The acting isn't very good, but something may be lost in the translation between Japanese middle school and American English. The students, unlike the starving paupers of ""The Hunger Games,"" seem oddly pampered and bewildered by the fact ""Battle Royale"" even exists. In that regard they are less a product of a dystopian society and more akin to the victims in ""Saw"".

But that distinction makes it all the more terrible as 15-year-old kids reveal the worst and best of human nature. Some characters are unsympathetic ciphers, while others are monstrous because of the societal constraints placed upon them.  Although ""The Hunger Games"" certainly provides a more logical place for the ritual murder of children, ""Battle Royale"" is its darker shadow, picking up where ""Lord of the Flies"" left off.

1441393,4,B00005JL9A,"I thought this movie was better than the Hunger Games. I ended up renting it twice! The plot lines for both movies were similar focusing on a game in which kids were trapped in an arena and forced to kill each other until one victor is left standing.  And yes, both movies involved teen romance. But BR had many differences.  The BR characters were not prepped for battle beforehand and have no mentors/kind adults.  The BR director also managed to cram in the stories of over ten characters AND personalize each story unlike the Hunger Games where the kids are killed off with only a few hints on their past history.  The BR character histories emerged slowly throughout the movie.  The director cunningly managed the development to mirror the actions of the characters.

Stark violence and disturbing scenes may not appeal to some viewers.  The Hunger Games sanitized the violence whereas BR seems to linger on violent scenes.  Sadly, my husband did not like the movie as much as me because he wanted more special effects, had trouble telling characters apart and was not familiar with Japanese movies which have a bizarre mash-up of cuteness and violence/psychopathy.

1441433,2,B00005JL9A,"I rented Battle Royale due to the number of multiple-star reviews, but by the end I wondered what all the hype was about.  Yes, it's pretty clear that The Hunger Games owes some of its ideas to Battle Royale.  The basic concept and many of the ideas within the film (zones, ""off-limits"" areas, gangs working in tandem, deceit, etc.) were very much a part of Battle Royale long before the Hunger Games series was penned.

But when I watched the film, what overwhelmed me was not the violence but the melodrama of the whole thing.  I lost count of the pained expressions, the looks of yearning, and declarations of unrequited love. The movie had just about every teen movie trope I'd seen in countless other films.  The geek.  The abused victim with a drunken parent.  The good boy.  The bad girl.  The girl gang.  The computer geek with a plan.  All of them were written with the expertise and subtlety of a screenwriter with no more than a couple high school Literature classes under their belt.  The characters were so broadly written, and cliche'd, that the sheer over-the-top emotion was hard to sympathize with.

I also was surprised at the glaring warnings about how the film was rated R-15 (or whatever it's called in Japan), where anyone under the age of 15 is banned from watching the film.  Other than a few squibs, the violence primarily consisted of fake blood spray, stains on shirts, and an awful lot of cgi blood.  In fact, a film like this would barely rate a PG-13 in the U.S.  I could also remember virtually no profanity that would have justified anything more than a PG.  The violence is only shocking, perhaps, in the manner in which it was perpetrated against teenagers, but it was actually rather sanitized compared to films like Kick Ass and even Attack The Block (itself not terribly shocking.)

So in the end, you get an over-the-top, melodramatic, and at times nonsensical film of attrition that follows a pretty routine formula to an end that most anyone could have predicted from the start.  There were few twists and turns, an awful lot of CGI blood, and one HECK of a laundry bill at the end. (Getting all that red blood out of those white shirts must have required a year's supply of bleach!)",1335830400,7,2223,4.625
1441434,5,B00005JL9A,"Loved the Hunger Games series (books), so naturally since there is so much comparison I had to read/watch Battle Royale before making any assumptions.

The movie, though sickening and violent, somehow manages to draw in the audience with the interesting story lines of each character. Sometimes funny and always outrageous, Battle Royale will not be a movie that the viewer soon forgets. You get to know the children as they are taken down one by one, in an emotionally draining effort to understand the psychology of each other.

For anyone who loves cinema, Battle Royale is a necessary watch. The mix of suspense, violence, comedy, and drama is utilized to its full extent by the director, who uses perfect timing in each of these categories. Together it creates a cinematic gem, a movie that is disturbing, creepy, sad and even at times a bit funny. It is easy to see why Tarantino loves this movie, as it is obvious he has taken much inspiration from this film.

I highly recommend it to any viewer who enjoys the psychological thriller type movie, so long as they can withstand the violence and the basic notion of children in a death match.",1335312000,2,1147,4.7537688442211055

Researching more, rumors about a re-make is in the works in Hollywood. Can't wait to see that one.  Anyway, back to this version.  I can't say its the greatest movie in the world, nor can I say it is the worst movie ever made, nevertheless the theme of the movie is  disturbing, which is why I gave the movie four stars.

It's where 42 junior high students every year must wear special tracking necklaces that tracks their pulses but would explode if they mess with them and that the students are randomly selected one by one to be on an island where they are armed with weapons including supplies like food and water as they must hunt then kill each other until one remains victorious. However two students Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) however don't feel like killing as they want to find a way out of the island.

A brilliant and violent as hell Japanese Science Fiction action masterpiece! based on the best-selling Japanese novel, this is a terrific and gory as hell film that shattered new grounds, create controversy and even became a worldwide sensation. The film was a smash hit in it's country, earning acclaim and even being nominated for 10 Japanese academy awards. However it was never released on DVD in the US and Canada except in film festivals and had controversy over it during the post-columbine era and that Toei would not distribute this movie, over the last decade people had to buy R0 import copies at conventions and online and now the time has finally come as it has made it's American debut on DVD and Blu-Ray to cash-in on the similar themed movie ""The Hunger Games"". The performances are well done including Takeshi Kitano as the creepy teacher Kitano Sensai, there's plenty of unique futuristic ideas, an old fashioned plot about survival of the fittest and some social issues in it as well besides the bloody action sequences. This movie has gained a major cult following even among Quentin Tarantino who considers it his fave movie since 92 as it's that good and influential among many things including the recent ""Hunger Games"" books and movie which many fans will draw comparisons, this is a must see film.

Although i do own the 4-disc BR set from Anchor Bay, i'll talk about the single disc version which has the 122 minute Special Edition Director's Cut nicely remastered in high definition with a brilliant transfer and perfect sound quality that makes it the best looking version of BR yet around.

The contrast between the two groups (Total chaos vs Classical music) makes this a one of my favorite movies.  Yes, the plot isn't 100% original, but that can be said for every story.  It's how the artist creates their own 'twist' on a work of fiction.  The Hunger Games is not a ripoff, but doesn't stand out as something unique - appealing to most everyone.
BR is violent, brutally violent.  Yet, has a story arc.  HG action doesn't make it weak in comparison.  Parts of the book are great, but the ending was lackluster (As if in Star Wars, after Luke destroyed the Death Star, he went back to work at the moisture farm.)",1334534400,,904,4.391566265060241

Battle Royale (B.R.) was a really good movie. I saw The Hunger Games (H.G) 2 weeks ago. While watching Battle Royale, I noticed some similarities between The Hunger Games and Battle Royale. At first, I thought B.R. copied H.G. story line. I did some research and saw that B.R. book came out in 1999 and B.R. movie came out in 2000.
When I found that out, I thought Suzanne Collins (author of H.G.) copied B.R.

To the movie...

B.R. was a very good movie. Better than H.G.  B.R. had a good storyline, good action, fast-paced movie. H.G. was good as well. After seeing B.R., I felt H.G. copied B.R. storyline.

1441469,5,B00005JL9A,"It's taken a couple of days to really assess what I feel about the film which is usually a sign that's there much more going on and it takes some time to digest. Battle Royale is the best version of the ""making people fight to the death"" genre I've seen, easily trumping The Running Man and adding significantly more layers of complexity than The Hunger Games.

Many people are going to hate this film but it pays to look at the cultural legacy of the country it came from and the relationship between the older and younger generations in Japan. It speaks volumes that the Japanese government expected riots as a result of the film and several countries banned its release. In many ways it delivers the same cocktail of dystopian social commentary and extreme violence as films such as A Clockwork Orange.

It's very low budget so don't expect flawless effects or production but do expect solid pacing, a gory gusto and one of the finest ensemble performances you'll see from such a young cast. Battle Royale skates into taboo areas and shocks the audience with visceral moral situations but despite the violence and bleak outcome for most of the cast, it's a haunting film that would simply never be made in the USA.",1333324800,3,1217,4.655813953488372

1441512,5,B00005JL9A,"So much has been written about the film.  So much has been said.  So much has been debated, discussed, dissected, and so much has been praised or insulted or misunderstood.  Those of us who celebrate film will always owe a special debt to the people at Anchor Bay: for the first time since it was released, BATTLE ROYALE is now being made available - uncensored, uncut, unrated - in America.

No doubt that BATTLE ROYALE's Blu-ray release was intended to coincide with the launch of another  book-turned-film-franchise, THE HUNGER GAMES, in theatres in March, 2012.  Clearly, that's some savvy marketing, as people from around the world have been arguing about the comparisons since the books by Suzanna Collins appeared.  To her credit, Ms. Collins claims that she'd never heard of BATTLE ROYALE, nor read the 1999 Japanese novel of the same name that the movie was based on.  I'll take her at her word, and I'll leave that debate to folks who've schooled themselves in those facts.

In the not-too-distant-future, Japan's economy has collapsed.  As a result, unemployment is destroying the culture.  Crime is on the rise.  Hoping to keep its next generation under its control, the Japanese government passed The BR (`Battle Royale') Law, which requires one 9th grade class each year to be shipped off to an island.  Their mission?  Kill each other until only one person is left.  There are some other fine points to the game (i.e. each student is given a duffle full of supplies, the Island is broken into danger zones, etc.), but the message remains the same: 42 kids enter, 1 may leave.

That simple concept practically explodes into one of the bloodiest, shocking flicks captured on film!

As I said above, much has been written about ROYALE's violence, so much so that I'll take a pass on that topic.  Violence is violence - there isn't any escaping it - and, when buckets of blood rules at the box office, the film certainly delivers.  What fascinated me much more about this story is the way that the 42 students of the film created their own subcultures once they've been deposited on the island.  Some of them remain fiercely independent, while others are doggedly loyal to one another.  Some of them panic as a result of the circumstances, and they immediately turn on one another.  What's fascinating is that who they become as a result of the situation thrust upon them in many ways resembles an extension of who they were before it all when to heck in a handbasket.  The manipulative `losers' become even more manipulative in order to survive the game, just as the computer nerds quickly go to work on cracking the hard science behind their entrapment.  If anything, ROYALE shows - despite its joyous subversiveness - that who a person is at his core will inevitably dictate what he'll become when a new society comes calling.  Agree with it or not, that's a powerful message, and it clearly shows why ROYALE deserves much more study in the years ahead.  Now that it's available legitimately in the U.S., it'll hopefully gain an even greater following.

As stated, this is a fully uncut restoration, and it's been given a first class treatment here.  While the disc boasts absolutely zero special features, I'm so appreciative of having a clean cut available to me that I don't believe I missed much.  The picture is fabulous (mostly), but there are a few scenes which clearly were either shot poorly `in the can' or were tinkered with in post-production (zoom ins), a choice that ultimately limited the quality.  You'll see instantly what I mean: three or four short cuts are covered in grain.  Sound is excellent - a noticeable improvement over the previous foreign DVD release I've had in my collection for a few years - which is nice because the film makes great use of some background audio and even a limited score.  Now all we need is a massive ""Intellectual Edition"" release which scores and scores and scores of commentaries, essays, features, and interviews about the picture.

Maybe I'm overdoing it, and, if you think so, you'll have to pardon my excitement.  Those of us who've loved ROYALE privately for years are ecstatic to be treated to a terrific stateside release.  Yes, the film's dark.  Of course, it's a textbook example of subversive cinema at its finest.  It'll make you think, squeal, squirm.  Shock.  Joy.  Revenge.  And cookies.  Everything you could want in a picture is in here - somewhere - so, if you've never seen it, I encourage you to do it today.  Put the kids to bed.  Pop some fresh popcorn.  Dim the lights.  Prepare yourself for the darkest of dark tragedies - this modern day epic - and let the chips fall where they may.  Blood will be shed.  Oh, yes, it will.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Yes, BATTLE ROYALE is an instant classic.  While the subject matter or elements of the presentation may disturb you, keep in mind that there will probably never be another film like it in your lifetime.

In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Anchor Bay provided me with a DVD screener copy for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1333065600,7,5133,4.76844494892168

1441517,5,B00005JL9A,"When the latest YA fad of The Hunger Games came strolling through the culture, more than one nerd read a plot summary, and, forehead creased, muttered, ""What is this--Battle Royale?""

And, with a dramatic, acne-riddled flourish, the great barbarian hordes of the nerd kingdom raised their fists, babbling incoherant, adulterated Japanese.  Events like Comic Con and Dragon Con trembled with their tender, awkward rage.

I was at the frontlines of that unified moment of nerd rage, and I am happy to see this re-release of Battle Royale, even if it is clearly to try another dollar from the Young Adult section of the literary bankroll.

For the fledgling among you, Battle Royale is just a terrific watch.  Your cultural barometer doesn't have to go anywhere east for you to recognize this as a tense, horrifying thriller.  Beyond that, it does a great job of expressing the awkward, emotional strain of 9th graders, faced suddenly with certain death.  Their decisions--who to kiss, who to kill--shape them in our eyes.

Of course, the stand out performance here is that of Takeshi Kitano.  His twitchy, bizarre delivery haunts you, but also leaves room for sympathy, which is no small feat.  Sympathizing with a man who murders children is tough, even for those of us who have uncles just like that.

For return viewers, my recommendation is to purchase this edition.  Largely, for the translation.  While decent in earlier editions, by the end of the film (particularly the final three requiems), the translation becomes unbearably indecipherable.

1441520,1,B00005JL9A,"Read the novel and the manga and loved them both. The movie however was just not good. Of course it is hard to compress several phone book sized volumes into a 120 minute movie, but realize that the bulk of the material in the manga and the novel were not the killings but the back story for each character. It is the experiences (and traumas) of each character that gave us the context of the decision to kill or not kill that each one made. It is not enough to simply show killings without showing us the motivations behind them. Of course they all kill because they don't want to be killed, but without knowing whether they enjoyed doing it is part of the information conveyed in the manga and novel. This is what made us connect with each character.

In the novel and manga, it was the ""match ups"" that kept one's attention. Would the martial artist be able to beat a cold blooded killer? Would the beautiful vixen be able to seduce all guys to death? Would the athletic girl be able to fight off a stronger but undisciplined guy, would the semi-trained veteran be able to out maneuver the psycho? All of these were lost in the movie and we end up with kids that don't look, or act any differently from each other. Yes, these are teens and they would not know how to hold a gun, or shoot, or even to survive in the open, but even the main (evil) characters appear to move foolishly.

In the novel and in the manga, the wrapping up of the story is nicely done, like a twist in a mystery novel; in the movie it is boiled down to a ""hurry up and let's finish this before we run out of tape"" kind of deal.

1441566,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale is a must see if your looking for entertainment. Its not really a ""horror"" movie but what is happening to those kids is definitetly horrible!! It was a brilliant concept and i've never seen anything like it before. This film is unique and doesnt look like anything we usually see here in america in terms of violence and brutality...this is something else...something new and innnovative.....Many will say that its a very sick concept that is impossible....nobody would do this and ect....But the way it is presented should make us think about what we would do in such circumstances, how would we react? would we play along?....or would we rather die?...

""At the dawn of the millennium, the nation collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, AKA the BR Act...""....THE BATTLE ROYAL ACT.""

The Battle Royale Act would become the ultimate way of getting rid of this violence constantly growing up by letting students who dropped out and young criminals kill each other until only one of them survives and get a chance to live in peace. controlled and restrained by a metal collier around their neck that can explode at any moment, they will have to fight for there lives and kill everyone if they wanna live......its is brutal, violent and it does not forgive.

The acting is just perfect and also surprisingly human under the circumstances. Those young actors are all unkown to me but they all did very well. There is nothing cheesy here and those kids really wanna survive, the tone is serious, apocalyptic and screaming for survival!! Cinematography here is also something new i've never seen before...Its not new, not old, but captures the feel of the movie very well. there is a very moderate use of light with very interesting teint of green and blue... especially in the darker scenes at night or in the school.

The only downside of course would be the absence of an english version. All we have here is the subtitles,but believe me...after a few minutes in the movie you'll get use to it and won't need anything else!!. I gave up once and decided to watch it without reading but i got convinced to keep reading  because the dialogues in some of the scenes were just awesome! I would also strongly recommend to make sure your DVD player is compatible before buying this film. It is supposed to be region free (0). if your not sure, look for a different version with the appropriate region code for your DVD player.

1441569,1,B00005JL9A,"After reading the Hunger Games by Collins, I felt empty and unsatisfied.  I then signed onto Amazon and reviewed some of the reviews on her book and realized that I wasn't alone.  I found that her ideas for her book assumingly came from another book, which was Battle Royale.  I had to find out whether it was true, since The Hunger Games read like a bunch of plots tied into one.

It took me 3 days total to read the 600 pages of Battle Royale.  The book was Awesome!  I loved reading it and enjoyed every second.  The story was so well put together and realistic that it had me thinking about highschool and what I would do if I were in that situation.  However, after getting into 20 minutes of the movie, I was disgusted.  I couldn't beleive that the Director took a already perfectly set plot and distorted it to make no sense.

Then I saw that so many people commented positvely on the movie and thought that it might actually be as good as the book or better.  Total opposite!  The movie was horrible.  Actually it was ridiculous, considering that the book provided a perfect premise.

I can only say that I am glad that I read the book first, or I would have never known how good it was based on the movie.  The Hunger Games were a total sham.  After reading the first book, which took me 3 weeks to read all 300 plus pages, I decided not to read another.  After reading Battle Royale, I can see why so many people accused Collins of stealing the idea from Battle Royale (the novel).  If you don't beleive me, read the novel.

1441604,3,B00005JL9A,"The film version of Koushun Takami's novel BATTLE ROYALE makes major changes that may annoy fans of the book.  The biggest change is the central premise behind the story.  In the novel, ""Battle Royale"" is part of the totalitarian government's program designed to terrorize the populace and prevent resistance - each year, 42 middle school students are taken from their families and forced to participate in a brutal competition that will result in the deaths of all but one of the children.  In the film version, directed by Kinji Fukasaku, ""Battle Royale"" is the government's response to a rash of teenage violence and misbehavior.  The film opens with scenes of students refusing to go to school, openly resisting authority, and even violently assaulting adults (including a teacher).  As stated in the film, ""The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, aka the BR [or Battle Royale] Act.""  This changes things greatly - while the children in the novel are completely innocent middle school students being manipulated by an evil government, the children in the film are portrayed as miscreants who brought the horror on themselves.

Another major change is the role of the instructor who directs the program - in the novel, this is Sakamochi, who explains the rules to the students and begins the terrorism; in the film, the instructor is a new character, Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), who is a former teacher of the students (and who has a strange and unexplained relationship with Noriko (Aki Maeda), the young female protagonist).  The difference here is striking - while Sakamochi was portrayed as a heartless symbol of the totalitarian government, Kitano demonstrates human qualities that allow us to sympathize with him (at least on some level) by the end of the film.

Whether these changes bother you or not will probably determine whether you like the film.  I found it to be interesting and engaging, but never quite real.  As expected, there is a lot of violence, but it reminded me more of the kind of thing found in popular video games rather than anything that might actually happen in real life.  Perhaps that was the director's point - he seems to want to numb his audience with over-the-top scenes of gunfire, slashing, gushing blood, and exploding body parts.  I actually found some of the battle scenes laughable - more than a few times I wondered how anyone could absorb so many rounds of machine-gun fire and still keep getting up!

It's also a little hard to take all the middle school crush stuff that permeates the film (there is plenty of this in the novel, too, but because the characters seemed more real and fleshed out it made more sense; here it just seems absurd).  The central couple, Noriko and Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) are believable, but others don't work as well.

Overall, the film version of BATTLE ROYALE can be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie, but as an adaptation of the novel it's not very successful.  It's worth a watch, but don't expect the level of complexity and thematic depth found in the novel.",1314230400,2,3104,4.915708812260537

1441608,3,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale is a stylish, bloody action flick.  I enjoyed the movie and thought it was cool, but it basically cuts the heart out of the story told in the novel.  I hate to give a trite ""the book was better"" review of the film, which is a good action movie in its own right, but the characters in the book are fleshed out so much better.  When you watch Battle Royale, you are only caring about a few of the characters.  The rest only serve to steal the spotlight for a moment while they die in various violent death scenes.  It's like watching action movies where dozens of people get killed and you aren't attached to any of them.  Or slasher films, where you go in knowing most of the foolish teenage cast is going to be taken out one at a time for your viewing pleasure.  The characters serve the violence, whereas in the book, the violence serves to glorify the wonderful cast of characters.  Every character that only gets a few moments in the film, gets whole pages devoted to them in the novel.

Unlike the book, the character of the teacher Kitano is a likeable character with some depth.  I'm not sure if this enhances the story any, because the character he was based on from the novel, Kinpatsu Sakamochi, worked great as a despicable bad guy for the reader to hate.  By making Kitano a sympathetic character, the film's final act works very differently than the book.  Still, I enjoyed the final scenes of the film.  I don't mind when movies branch away from their source material.  It gives the viewer a new, different experience.  Sadly, the trade-off here is that, while Kitano's character is enhanced by the screen version of the character, the rest of the cast completely lose what made them special in the original story.

If you are interested in cool action movies with stylized violence, or if you just want to see dozens of teenagers kill each other on screen, this is a fun movie, and a cult classic.  However, if you want a better experience, I would recommend that you read the original novel.  Every single character is a wonderful creation whose death is meaningful (sometimes tragic, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes even darkly funny, but always felt by the reader).  The movie loses what truly made the story special.  The sense of suspense and distrust is almost completely gone here.  Beautiful, tragic stories are not told.  They cut out one of my favorite characters completely.  The protagonists are much better characters in the novel.  And the antagonists, especially the wicked Mitsuko and Kiriyama, actually have their warped personalities explained.

It might be unfair to judge the film in comparison to the novel, because it is a good action movie in its own right.  It's just a pale shadow of the story and the amazing characters it's based on.",1304208000,,2789,4.675564681724846
1441609,4,B00005JL9A,"I stumbled upon this movie after reading Suzanne Collins' ""Hunger Games"" and seeing how everyone keeps on comparing what happens in the book to this movie.  Just by reading about the premise, I had expected this to be some kind of a twisted exploitation film with lots of gratuitous violence.  But what I got is a thought-provoking film that is as relevant now as it was back when it was made at the beginning of the millenium.

So the story takes place in the near future, when the government in Japan has collapsed and youngsters are allowed to run amock...causing chaos and fear among the adults.  In an effort to curb the growing violence perpetrated by the youth of the nation, the government came up with what is referred to as the BR act.  Each year, a 9th grade class would be randomly selected and driven to a desert island under the guise of a class field trip.  Once there, they will be given a bag of food, a piece of weapon, and told that they will have 2 days in which to kill each until there is only 1 left.  To keep everyone under check, and make sure that there will be a winner, all the students are forced to wear a collar around their neck that will explode and kill everyone if there is still more than 1 person left alive at the end of the 2-day period.

Desipte what some people say about how violent this film is, I found the level of violence no more than what one would see in most R-rated movies these days.  The body count is high, but the cameras do not make a point to linger on the bloody scenes so that after the 1st couple scenes, the rest of the bloodbaths can no longer shock you.  Instead, you are allowed to focus on the nuanced relationships that develops between the students as some of them elect to follow the dictates of the game and turn on their friends, while others chose to rebel against the authority, to badn together and try to find ways to thwart the adults' plans for them.  For a film that starts out with a cast of 40+, the director did a very good job and developing the relationships and giving some of the characters personalities and enough background story so that you come to care about them.  There are also themes of trust, betrayal, friendship, and love peppered throughout the film...no small feat for a movie of this length.

Ultimately, this is not so much a movie about mindless violence but a commentary on a society that has become increasingly out-of-touch with its youth.  I've often thought that with the advent of the Internet age, where instant gratification is more the norm than the exception, where graphic violence are readily dispensed with the click of the button...that coupled with the tremendous strides in terms of economic advancement many countries have experienced over the last decade, the youth of the world has become increasingly more and more self-entitled, less willing to put in the hard work, and generally have exhibited a lack of understanding when it comes to distinguishing right from wrong.  While the solution this movie came up with is ridiculous and extreme, it does provide some much needed food for thought.",1303776000,,3113,4.563734290843806
1441649,5,B00005JL9A,"I must start by saying I don't fully understand why there is such controversy around this film. There are far worse films for graphic violence churned out of Hollywood each year, just think of 'Saw' or 'Hostel', and this is quite tame in comparison. The premise of this film is superb and is where it really shines and the acting is pretty good as well. I like the way it explore the various options that may be taken in such a situation, from those refusing to fight, those who try to outwit the system, the lone killers and those who band together. There is a lot more to this film than the violent depictions and I agree that it is a very potent piece of social commentary. I also agree with those reviews that liken this film to 'Lord of the Flies', it really does to seem to be a modern equivalent. This is well shot, well acted and has a good premise and script, I'd ignore the overly hyped controversy of this film and highly recommend a viewing. Great world cinema.

1441650,5,B00005JL9A,"When I first heard about BATTLE ROYALE, it sounded like a mindless, ultra-violent movie about survival. Having seen it, I can say that, while it deals w/ survival, it's also a social satire / black comedy that uses violence to drive its point home. It reminded me (a bit) of LORD OF THE FLIES, only w/ far more mass murder! Actually, what I liked most were the more touching, emotional moments in between the brutal deaths. The friendships, the doomed, secret crushes, and the sacrifices made for others. Without these parts, BR would have been as stupid as BOOT CAMP! Another thing worth noting is the cast's acting.

The movie itself is the best I've ever seen it. I'm just a dumb American who has bought a few copies hoping for both a good video picture and accurate subs...I've only had the former and never the latter. So when I got this in and watched it...it was almost like seeing a totally new movie. I actually KNEW what they were saying. I no longer think the Japanese are as weird as I once did. Seriously, if someone said ""You've got to survive!"" the copies I've had in the past would either not have anything in the subs or something like ""Don't trouble the underwear!"".

That alone is worthy of a purchase.

As far as importing it, I'd suggest it. Even if the American release from Anchor Bay is virtually the same set...it's still cool having this numbered version. I mean, really, ten thousand is like nothing.

Oh, all the BTS stuff has been remastered and re subtitled as well, same reaction there. Just perfect execution. My only 'real' complaint is that it's the size of a dvd box so it towers over other BD cases on the shelf. But who cares? It should!

1441716,2,B00005JL9A,"Sorry.. didn't work for me... I certainly get the point though. This life is nothing if not predictable in its utterly cruel way of recurring behavioral patterns. The key-words nowadays are ""cool"" and ""hip"" forms of parenting, in a ridiculous attempt to identify with the up-and-coming generations of alienated youths. Boundaries are blurred. Parents abandon their stoic posture and yield to hedonism, refuting egregiously their years of experience. When purposeful regression takes center stage, all hell will break loose. So, when haughty, hormone-driven adolescents see that they have their affection-deprived parents on their knees, a greater sense of already-gargantuan entitlement takes over. And this extends into the every sphere of life, especially in social gatherings, and even more in the classroom, where hiding under the surface of blatant infantile behavior lies intensely insecure thought processes. Anyway, the fabric of school tries to institute a neo-superego, but since the primordial one has been vanquished, why should this one be allowed to prevail??? It shouldn't, that's why students just don't care, and their parents are too afraid of losing their children completely (a cataclysmic death of self as well, since children are the redefinition of their rebirth) and simply don't choose to emphasize the importance of education. The movie tried to take the side of the kids, giving everyone a brief background that tries to be inspiring... it vilifies some of them as well so we know who to cheer against (there is an ineffectual attempt to humanize the girl with the scythe by showing her brush with a potential child molester). Now, the solution in this case is pure fascism, and it is a very moronic way of looking at life. The reason we have so many school shootings and whatnot in the US is because the culture causes a spiritual suffocation and death, there is no room for negotiation, there are no shades of gray, so extreme behaviors are adopted to get the point across. Here, it's the same thing, adopting radical dogmas for a much deeper-seeded behavioral issue that derives from the adults' lack of insight into self and how to raise their kids... bah... I usually try to stick with the story in my reviews, not focusing on technical aspects. Unfortunately, I must comment, the acting was very poor..

1441748,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale: 10/10: Another classic is born. A fantastic combination of classical music and ultra-violence like a Japanese Clockwork Orange. Here is one Japanese film the major studios will not be remaking anytime soon.

The plot consists of a junior high school class sent to a deserted island, given weapons that vary in usefulness, and are ordered to kill each other. Oh and they have those exploding collars that are ubiquitous in sci-fi films today so if they don't kill all their classmates everyone dies.

The actors are actual kids and the film turns the bloody up to eleven. Add in child suicide, child prostitution, patricide, and worst of all basketball and you have yourself a winner.

Battle Royale falls solidly in the category of Dawn of the Dead or Kill Bill where it transcends its obvious pulp and horror appeal and says larger things about life as a whole.

But who am I kidding non-stop action, hot chicks in schoolgirl outfits, very dark humor and a great classical music score. Kind of like She's All That if Freddy Prinze Jr. killed a classmate every two minutes then had his head blown off by remote control. Throw in Anna Paquin dismembering Rachael Leigh Cooke with a fondue fork and that should give you the picture.

Man that movie would rule' Sorry went all fan boy there for a minute. Battle Royale has deep things to say about society and is an important landmark film. [...].",1255824000,3,1409,4.73469387755102

First, the premise of the Battle Royale is given cursory attention... apparently spanking kids no longer works so teenagers just run wild with no consequence while adults suck it up.  To punish these out of control teens, a law is passed where a random class if forced to fight to the death.  But, for what purpose or point?  When the kids wake up from being drugged, they have no clue what is going on.  If the Battle Royale was suppose to be some kind of means of warning to teens to behave, why wouldn't these teens have realized right away what was going on?

The overall production values were mediocre, the acting over the top, and massive plot gaps abounded.  I guess people equate this as some kind of cinematic equivelant of Lord of the Flies or something, but it is really much much less.",1254009600,2,1020,4.451612903225806
1441750,5,B00005JL9A,"Kinji Fukasaki's ""BATTLE ROYALE"" (Batoru Rowaiaru, 2000) is the type of film whose reputation precedes it. Remade recently as ""The Condemned"" by the U.S., the film sparked such controversy and almost became banned from its native Japan. Its hype was far-reaching that when the movie reached America, it was even proclaimed the `movie of the decade'. I'm not sure whether I can agree with that claim but one thing's for sure; Japanese filmmakers had the guts to pull off a movie that depicts violence and murder done by teenagers. It is easy to dismiss ""Battle Royale"" as an action-packed, exploitive thriller but the movie is just so much more.

In a not-so different alternate future, Japan has experienced economic collapse with a massive unemployment rate. With no clear future, students begin to disrespect the education system, with an increase in riots and violence, student drop outs are also occurring at an alarming rate. To control the situation, the government enacts the ""Battle Royale Act"" that consists of the selection by secret lottery for one of the poorest performing class in the country and sending the students off to an island where they must fight each other to the death until only one is left standing. The students have 72 hours to complete the game or everyone dies from the explosive devices on their necks. They are supplied with random weapons, given special instructions to avoid danger zones and if they make trouble, the army will find them and kill them. Former friends are forced to kill or be killed; the students experience mistrust, fear, confusion and hatred, as chaos run unchecked...

""Battle Royale"" serves as a cautionary tale for the teen generation. It does start off simply enough, with themes of morality and immorality are presented in the film's first act. There is a small hole but the film's plot holds strong as Fukasaki's adaptation of the novel generates suspense and gritty thrills as there are no dull moments in the film. It also lets its characters speak for themselves, characterization is partly done through the use of flashbacks. Kitano (played by Takashi Kitano) is the former teacher who has his own issues, the students all have different backgrounds, and they all have different reactions to their situation as well differing motivations. I liked the characters especially those of Mitsuko (played by Ayana Noguchi, her character shines in the Special version) and Noriko (Aki Maeda), they appear to be similar sides of the same coin although very different. Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara, Death Note) is the one person who tries keep his moral beliefs, I may even go as far as his only motivation would be Noriko. Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) is the one student who was mostly an enigma throughout the film, his motivations remained unclear until the final act.

The film has a subtle but powerful social commentary as well but none as resounding as the message Fukasaki brings into exposition for teens. Fukasaki does keep the messages restrained to avoid the film from becoming ruined by a heavy-handed sentimentality. He brings the idea of ""working together"" which was formerly the foundation of Japanese society. Overtime, such teamwork collapses as the sheer pressure of survival proves too much as mistrust plants its ugly root. You see some students working as a team, but such ""team-ups"" are ultimately ruined by insecurity and fear. The film's final act resoundingly says that one has to trust each other wholeheartedly in order to achieve success. Fukasaki also encourages today's youth to ""go for it"" as if to say that the future is theirs for the taking; believe in yourself and don't be too hasty in trusting adults. There are also several other strong messages in the film as certain dark themes in the complexities of everyday life are touched on; jealousy, fear, meekness, dishonesty, love, shame and helplessness. The characters do have a way out of this situation and they must face the problem head-on; they must do the best they can to deal with it. The reactions are pretty reflective of their own sense of morality (or immorality).

The film has sparked strong controversy in America for its main premise of ""kids killing kids"" and while the violence is indeed brutal and uncompromising in this director's cut, it is not much as to how violent it is, (I've seen films more violent and brutal) but the film touches a nerve that makes it hard to see kids killing kids...it is not so much the act of killing but the who is doing the killing. It is pretty disturbing to see kids acting like this, some are scared that they commit suicide, some try to take advantage of others while others revel in the violence for fun. Having innocents put in a situation where they must kill people they know to survive is the troubling part of the film. I also think that Fukasaki cautions teenagers from mocking adults and to mind themselves otherwise, the repercussions of their actions may be just be too much.

The dramatic scenes aren't overwrought and I liked the even direction done by Fukasaki. He never allowed his social commentaries or his heavy themes and messages mess with the film's action and violence. Fukasaki appears to also be poking fun at the dramatic sequences that anyone can form an attachment to the film even by approaching it from an exploitive, unadulterated dark fun standpoint. The film is also suspenseful as you see the death toll rise up after each `update', one can easily feel dread wondering whether the characters they've rooted for would survive. (6-8 of them take center stage)

America easily proclaimed the film as brutal, violent and uncompromising but truth be told, the violence in ""Battle Royale"" isn't something new to the experienced movie watcher. The blood and guts (with mild gore) does help the film along, but it isn't all about the action but a matter of which Fukasaki delivers his message to Japanese society. Takeshi Kitano is awesome as usual and Masanobu Ando is creepy as the student who never speaks. Chiaki Kuriyama (plays Chigusa) caught Tarantino's eye that she played Go-go Yubari in ""Kill Bill"". (Did I fail to mention that this is among QT's favorite films?) ""Battle Royale"" is far more than an action film that glorifies blood and violence, some would say that it is simply an orgy of violent behavior while others who see the message will absolutely adore the film. It is one film that has the balls to portray violence that has real emotions going for it. One thing's for sure, it is one film that will never be forgotten and one that which Hollywood wishes it thought of the idea first--or had the guts to pull it off.

What was that some say that Asian directors can't keep up with the big-shots of Hollywood? Those who said that deserve a Spider Finger Jab in the face...

1441806,3,B00005JL9A,"The book is one of my favorites, and I wanted to give a review for those curious how it handles the epic scale that is the book. The movie wasn't bad, but it could have been handled a little better. One great thing about the book is it's incredible character focus. Each and every one of the 42 students had a background and a story to go with them. Most of them were interconnected either as friends or enemies or even secret crushes (and there were numerous).

And unfortunately, this is where the movie brings its first major issue. Obviously, it can't focus on 42 different characters like the book can, but it didn't even keep the same kind of feel for some of the characters. Shogo, who was my favorite character in the book, was much less mysterious and much less cool in the movie than he was in the book. Hiroki, who was another one of my favorites, had much less of an importance in the movie than the book, and he also lost his best character quality because of his lack of screen time -- his unstoppable devotion. And the mystery of why he was hunting down the second of the two girls was played out much more in the book, though I do think the eventual scene that occurs between them was done quite well in the film. Shinji's character was reduced to almost non-existent, Shuya became incredibly whiny, and any and all background or explanation for Kazuo was just left out. Mitsuko, however, was done rather decently, and there's a scene that's in the director's cut that helps explain to those who haven't read the book a bit about her past (though it is altered quite a bit). On the upside, although they changed the teacher/director character completely from the book to the film (it is not a former teacher or any of that in the book), I like how they added more humanity and even some pity to his character in the film. There was more depth to that character in the film than in the book.

But I think the biggest issue with all of these character changes came from trying to turn a 600+ page book into a two-hour movie. And while those two hours moved by incredibly fast (didn't even feel like two hours), the whole movie felt like how the first fifteen-to-twenty minutes of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire went (200 pages of book crammed into that tiny period). It had a lot of tiny bits of information of characters and scenarios here and there, and those were always fun to catch as a reader of the book, but it still left out or altered too much. For instance, the huge explosion and the scene that leads up to it at the end of the movie occurs around the two-thirds mark of the book... not the climax. And the final showdown with Kazuo was incredibly lame in the movie in comparison to the book... not to mention because of the ending's incredible alteration, one of my favorite (and one of the most powerful, I think) lines in the book wasn't in the movie. I don't want to list all the alterations and discrepancies between the two works, but I will list one more major one that was left out: the anti-government and rock-n-roll stuff. That all played such an enormous part of the book, and besides one scene where you see Shuya playing guitar in a flashback, there's no mention of it whatsoever, and that also took away from the power of the ending, making it more cheesy because it didn't rely back on a major theme.

Now, I didn't hate the movie. I just felt that while the book had a more powerful feeling behind it, the movie was reduced to almost nothing more than a common action movie. But looking at the movie as a movie instead of an adaptation, it was pretty entertaining. It wasn't super gory or anything, and the blood was more along the lines of Quentin Tarantino (you can tell it's fake, and it's in excess at certain moments to make a point). The action was pretty good, though the character development, even looking at it from a non-adaptation standpoint, could have used some work. As I said, at least in the director's cut, the teacher and Mitsuko's characters were handled pretty well. Noriko was similar to how she was in the book (she's more of a symbol than anything), though the danger level of her survival is much more suspenseful in the book (the book plays up on her initial wound and possible infection from it much more than the movie, which takes roughly one minute to tackle that whole issue). Shogo could have been done a lot better. He's not shown enough to where you can get a good sense of his character before the big end reveal. And Shuya seemed to be more of a prop in the movie than anything. The other major characters, such as Hiroki and Shinji, were dwindled down to mere plot devices. And I think with a lot of the stuff the writer of the film tried to put into the movie version might confuse some of the people who hadn't read the book version, because there were some things that were brought up or shown but never explained.

One last thing to bring up is the music (and the cinematography). I figured, from the book, the music would be some old school rock songs, but as that whole theme was removed from the film, they used a lot of classical music or orchestral music. And I have to say, for the most part, I really enjoyed that choice. Though some of the time it was too much and took me out of the scene, but overall, I really liked how the music was done for this film. That just really struck me as something to mention. And to touch on the cinematography briefly... nothing special, though the scene toward the end with the fire after the explosion was pretty cool looking.

Overall, without looking at the film as an adaptation, I might give it a star higher. But this review is written for those curious about how it adds up to the book. As an adaptation, I would have given it a 2. As a non-adaptation, maybe a 4. So I'm meeting in the middle.",1233619200,5,5832,4.3863216266173755

There are lots of things that cinema can do, if it chooses.

On almost every level, this movie challenges and entertains the viewer at the same time. We don't *need* to ask whether the island stands for greater society (or if we essentially teach our children to go out and butcher their friends, to ""compete""), or anything vaguely academic like that, but we can -- the movie supports it.

1441876,4,B00005JL9A,"When one looks past the modest production values and few scenes where the acting seems a bit unrealistic (or perhaps simply to my American eye), Battle Royale succeeds in it's aims and succeeds as a movie. The fear of a situation of being pitted in a life or death situation was well-captured, and overall the acting was very good, especially considering the fact that besides Beat Takeshi, all of the other central are played by relative newcomers.

This may seem like an extremely violent film at face value, but Fukasaku tries hard not to overdo the violence and gore, and holds either a certain respect for or a certain humor of the portrayal of death (the one over-the-top scene seems more comedic than sickening, and seems fitting, due to the character's role as an antagonist). Because of the strive for realistic death, and because of the good acting in the scenes between the violence, characters are able to grow. Death of some of the more central characters begin to carry emotional weight, despite the cast of 40-odd characters packed into a 2 hour film. This is where I found Battle Royale a good film; despite amazingly short screen times for most of the characters, Fukasaku is still able to make us care about them, to sympathize with a position we will never find ourself in.

Now on to a completely different topic... As for this ""Director's cut"" from Amazon, I found it included some nice additional footage, from typical cast reviews to video of the whole cast celebrating Fukasaku's birthday. However, the quality of the picture of these as well as the movie was a bit grainy and of a lower quality than I'm used to, to the point where the DVD feels a bit like a bootleg. And because of the more than modest price of the DVD, I'd personally recommend you first look for other options.

1441878,4,B00005JL9A,"""Battle Royale"" was much talked-about in the United States back in 2001, but it took a while to get here, allegedly because distributors were reluctant to promote 2 hours of teenagers on a killing spree. The film is based on the popular Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, whose considerable length condenses surprisingly well to a fast-paced feature film. In a dystopian future, Japan is at risk of societal collapse from high unemployment, economic stagnation, and general discontent. Youth bully their teachers and boycott school. The ""BR Act"" is passed, authorizing the government to select classes of 9th graders to be confined to a deserted island and forced to fight each other to the death until only one student remains.

Shuya (Tatsuya Rujiwara) is a thoughtful young man who lost both of his parents to Japan's bad times. On a class trip, he and his classmates are drugged, transported to the island where they will be forced to take part in the Battle Royale, and fitted with electronic collars that monitor their movements. Their bombastic teacher Kitano (Beat Takeshi) explains the rules of the game and distributes a survival kit and one weapon to each of the 42 students, including 2 mysterious ""exchange students"". If more than one person survives 3 days, they all die. We follow Shuya and his friend Noriko (Aki Maeda) as they come to grips with their situation and try to survive with the aid of Kawada (Taro Yamamoto), an older student whose purpose is not at first clear.

The film strays from the book in some details but is substantively similar. We don't get to know the secondary characters as well, so questions of trust are not as complex as in the book. The instructor Kitano is fleshed out more in the film and comes across as a lonely and strangely pathetic man. It's interesting to observe how the various personalities react to the game, from the young lovers who commit suicide to the sickle-wielding vamp Mitsuko (Kou Shibasaki) who is determined to win. The politics behind the ""BR Act"" is simplified and more coherent in the film. Adults fear youth, because their refusal to accept the values of their elders will exacerbate social collapse. The ""BR Act"" forces young people to compete ruthlessly or perish. Kitano's sick sense of humor provides comic relief. ""Battle Royale"" is a bloody, unsubtle satire, but it's entertaining.",1200614400,4,2362,4.932160804020101

A stunningly original, if intensely graphic satire, Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is based around the concept of 42 school children being taken to a remote Pacific island to engage in a very real death match. Set in a Japanese colony of the very near future, the action follows those youngsters as they are dispatched on the island where with three days worth of arms and food, they must fight to the death. The ultimate winner - and, of course, there can be only one - is then deemed fit to retake their place in Japanese society. In equal measures, violent and humourous, Battle Royale ignores the accepted parameters of the average action movie, and instead offers a savage critique of the pressures and motivations of young people in today's society. As you'd expect for a movie with killing as its central theme, there's a tremendous amount of bloodshed in Battle Royale but, believe it or not, it's thoughtfully handled by the director.",1190246400,3,969,4.878787878787879

Trust me, I bought them all; The most dangerous game, Bloodlust,Hard Target, the Running Man, Game of Death 1+2, Series 7, Surviving the Game and scores more including the new release of the Condemned, which is the American version of battle (in my opinion).

I am not going to give spoilers, if you have read this far you know damn well what it is about. I am going to say that it is the best subtitled film I own and a top twenty staple in my collection. The characters are lifelike, the action is more raw than any big budget, overproduced American film of the genre because of little nuances such as the fact you can't tell what is going to happen next by the musical cues. And perhaps most importantly, you will never guess who will live through this thing, by now I can usually pick a winner and this film proved me wrong and I love it for beating me at my (it's) own game, so to speak.

As most Asian movies it's suggestive as torn lace, but ultimately sexless. Yet the violence which is both premeditated as it is random and horrific make this worth owning.

1441939,4,B00005JL9A,"This is a film with an extraordinarily flimsy and unrealistic premise. It violates its own rules and internal logic. It is, essentially, a great big snuff-film.

And I really liked it.

There's not a lot you can say about this film, really. 42 middle school kids, most of them played by actors who either actually are, or at least look close to, the ages of the characters are hauled out to an island and told to kill each other until only one is left. This is either a reality TV show or government pogrom, or possibly both. Either way, it's an absurd premise.

But it works. The acting is very good, and the characters are interesting (plus I really had a thing for Shuya). There's also quite a bit of blood and gore all over the place. Surprisingly, however, there's not as much as you might think. Mostly the shock of it comes not from the quanitity but from the fact that it's 14 - 16 year olds doing the deeds.

Ultimately this is a film worth getting. I bought the director's cut from Amazon and I'm quite pleased with it. Even the extras are well done. I would like it if the film got a North American distributor, but that's not likely. So order this version and enjoy.

As a side note, I hear there's an American version of the film in the works. Anyone wanna take bets on how badly they'll screw it up? Either we'll have the characters all aged up to college, or at least high school, and likely if they do keep them young, we'll have them played by older actors.

1441983,5,B00005JL9A,"That old silent film is of course a classic. It comes from the German school of horror films in the 1920s. It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is  quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard. The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the cock crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ? The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people. The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations. The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque. It is just expressive enough to mean what it is supposed to mean without any negative second level reading.

However, the movie leaves out almost all of the crucial character background stories and key character details, as well as many deep themes.

1442027,5,B00005JL9A,"Let me be blunt: this is not considered an ""intellectual"" film. Nonetheless, this is one of the most riveting films I have seen in ages. As you know, this film has been banned in multiple countries and is not well-appreciated in its own. It breaks some pretty serious taboos . . . namely, young fresh-faced children hacking each other to bits:) Of course, the idea that the government has locked exploding collars around their tender necks is a horrific bonus!!

Takeshi Kitano is FANTASTIC as the school teacher with an innocent yet disturbing crush on one of his pupils and an obsession with her baked goods (Ohhh, and wait until you see his painting!!)
Likewise, the characters of Shuya and Noriko are spectacular in their roles. They bring likability to what should be an ""unlikeable"" film. Nonetheless, Kazuo Kiriyama and Mitsuko Souma easily steal the show! Kazuo volunteers to be in this massacre (apparently for the thrill)!! He has the looks of Johnny Depp matched with the endurance of Jason Vorhees (forgive the comparison!!) Meanwhile, Mitsuko presents us with the most complex character in the film: as a victim of (potential) sexual abuse and an uncaring mother, Mitsuko has learned not to trust anyone. Moreover, she has learned to use her sexuality to get through life (it's interesting to see how this aspect figures into combat).

What may surprise you is how FUNNY (intentionally) this film is!!! The training video alone will have you in stitches (The adorable host makes exploding heads sound like a Saturday morning cartoon ""BOOM!"")!! TRUST ME - FUNNY STUFF!!!

To be perfectly honest, I dread the American remake (slated for 2008 by NEW LINE). Part of the appeal is that this film is verboten!! NEW LINE, I am quite certain, will be content will an ""R"" rating for theaters . . . and that will be a shame. Additionally, the Japanese version has insanely BAD and AWKWARD translation which only heightens its amusing qualities.

No, Battle Royale doesn't have the INSANE gore of Ichi the Killer, but it is faster-paced, has a simpler story-line, and in a way, is more shocking.

You'll either love it or hate it . . . me, I LOVE IT!!! I show it to my students EVERY semester!!!

This film receives FIVE stars for its innovative, no-holds-barred approach!!

It is impossible for anyone to sit through it and not get anything out of it.

It is a bit violent (VERY violent) but if you were able to sit through Kill Bill without glancing away from the screen, you can definately handle this film. I recommend it to anyone that has the stomach for it.",1167868800,5,504,4.25
1442029,2,B00005JL9A,"I actually read the book before I saw this movie and I must say that I was terribly dissapointed.

I loved the book because of the social commentary (defining and striving for individualism in a conforming, constrictive society) and politcal statements about a society trying to thrive under an opressive government.  It was a story that could be applied any government in any country.  It's definitely a book you learn from.  It examines the essence of the human condition.  The movie deleted that entire theme.  It instead made up it's own theme which basically boils down to ""adults vs. children.""  In the movie, the adults were actually out to destroy kids (they actually said this).  This movie took away any poignancy that a story about middle school kids forced to kill each other could have.

Now, moving away from thematic differences, there are also huge plot differences as well.  It seems like almost everything was changed.  From huge details such as pretty much the entire ending of the movie (there is a huge random scene at the end that sums up the movie and wasn't present in the book) and adding a strange relationship with Kitano (Sakamochi in the book) and Noriko (or maybe just a very, very strange obsession).  Pretty much all the students were given different weapons and many die in very different ways.  They are given less time to complete the game as well.  In the book they have 3 days and in the movie they have a day (if I remember correctly).

There also isn't as much character development, but that's to be expected when you make a movie out of a book with over 600 pages and 40+ characters, so I can't fault it for that, but in general when that happens, a story becomes more about the action and plot than an overall message.  This movie fall victim to that.

The movie isn't all bad, however.  It is extremely entertaining and it will definitely be a conversation starter for friends.  It's a good movie to watch with all the lights off and a giant bowl of popcorn with a handfull of friends late at night.  There won't be any dissapointments (unless they've read the book already lol).

Oh, and I can't speak to the special features on this version because I have a korean box set (so random, I know) that comes with BR1 and BR2 (and don't even get me started on that one.  It's even worse) and a 3rd, special features, disc that I can't watch because it's in Japanese and has only Korean subtitles, two languages I cannot speak at all.

So overall, if you've read the book you probably won't like this movie much  at all, but if not, you'll most likely love it.  It's action packed with a pretty good message (albeit a very different one from the book).

I definitely suggest reading the book over watching the movie or, if you want to do both, watch the movie first.",1165968000,9,2805,4.5489021956087825

1442034,3,B00005JL9A,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is surrounding this movie. Sure, it is violent, but the violence itself was nothing more than slightly-creative killing with computer-added blood splashes. Really. Lots of gunshots, stabbings, but considering that all the kids were wearing explosive neckbands, you'd think there'd be ""heads-a'-poppin.'""

..but no.

In fact, though the countdown of deaths throughout the movie was a nice touch (adding to the ""game"" feel), the directors didn't spend much time exaggerating death or making it outlandishly violent. Rather tame by other Japanese films' standards. So, if the violence isn't the pull of this movie, then what is?

There is a small undertone of loyal friendship and personal justice interwoven to the story. While it's a bit far-fetched and poorly acted, it exists. Even the ""bad guy"" of the film comes off as being a little sentimental at the end. It doesn't work in the film, but it was possibly an attempt to make the movie more mature than it was coming off as.

Purely a fantasy movie due to the content and story, I had hoped the violence and the atmosphere were also more creative. This could have been an ultra-violent bloodbath, but for some reason, the directors chose to keep the violence simple and try to make us sympathize with certain characters. Unless you've got a keen eye and a knack for memorizing Japanese names, you may find yourself confused as to who you're supposed to ""root for"" and who you are supposed to dislike. (These kids look a lot alike.)

I give the film a solid three stars because it was interesting, but it was very, very weak in many parts. Violence was weak, story was underachieving and the ending was probably more sappy than it was poignant.

Though it would have been a throw-away shockfest, I would have prefered it to be an all-out killing spree movie. At least that way, it would have made more sense.",1161302400,6,1891,4.785276073619632

There is a profusion of blood and brutal violence in some scenes but the film is so terrific that fixes you in your seat. Expect a big surprise in the finale!",1159747200,5,502,4.715909090909091
1442096,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale is a film that has gained an enormous following despite the fact that it was never released in most of the world. It was in fact the controversy created by it that helped to make it sought after by some. So what is the basis for this controversy and what is really so bad about a movie that is as great work of political satire as there is out there? Well, read on to find out.

Battle Royale takes place in Japan during a time in which the insolence and lack of motivation of the populous has driven the government into action. In order to stop the development of so many good-for-nothing people in society, the BR (Battle Royale) Act was passed. Essentially the act is used as a way to motivate students and weed out the weak from the strong and as such make society more productive. The way it goes about this however is a bit out of the ordinary. Once a year, a ninth grade class is randomly selected to participate. In the instance shown by the movie a class leaves to go on a field trip and along the way become drugged and shipped to an island where the ""event"" will take place. The event being a three day long battle royale in which only one person is allowed to come away alive or else everyone will be killed. Putting friend against friend, how do the children respond to the order they have been given. Supplied with weapons and provisions, can they really turn against the others and kill them in cold blood, or is there anyway that trust can be found amongst the others?

The cast does an amazing job of portraying the twisted emotions that are felt within the students and even their former teacher (played wonderfully by Takeshi Kitano) who is put in charge of overseeing the entire affair. It is a profound look into the human psyche as well as a look at the overbearing opressive that the government is capable of holding over its people if not kept in check.

There really is no reason that the movie has been unable to be released in places such as America, but it is pretty obvious that with all of the over the top violence that takes place all involving ninth graders, it would definately come under fire should it ever be widely released. It is a movie that will both shock and awe viewers a like, and despite how shocked one may be they can't help but feel the overall power and message of the movie. It is truly one of film-makings most profound creations in recent decades and underneath all the shock and controversy, there is a profound message to be seen that is as true as any other. Highly recommended.",1157932800,5,2548,4.3940677966101696
1442097,5,B00005JL9A,"Directed by the late Kinji Fukasaku, ""Battle Royale"" is a truly magnificent film, and is highly recommended. I first saw the film a few years ago at the urging of a friend and was not disappointed in the least. The film itself is based on the novel by Takami Koshun, which I have not yet had the chance to read. The films narrative deals with the escalating violence among the youth in Japan, and in particular, with the violence in schools. Is the violence that bad? Are things really going to hell in the classrooms? The Japanese authorities seem to think so. So how do the authorities set about disciplining the youth? Detention and expulsion? No, that won't work. With high unemployment, the youth will just wander the streets and cause mayhem. Something much more harsh and drastic must occur in order to capture the present youths attention.

Moreover, the very fabric of the nation is at stake. How are the Japanese authorities going to set an example which will reverberate within their society? Well, for starters they pass a new law. So what! There are already laws on the books dealing with this kind of behavior---Right?. How will this new law change student behavior? Well, for starters, this is no ordinary law. This new law enacted by the government allows a quasi-military type militia to abduct students from selected schools and send them to an isolated island. But what ever for? Surely not a youth camp? There are enough of those already. No, this is something much more draconian and drastic.

Further, things are about to get very extreme in this new youth controlled government. For starters, this militia has complete control over these students lives, and they will force the youth to play out a very twisted and cruel game. One like no other they have ever played. [With the exception of two ringers who volunteer for the game]. As these students are sent to an undisclosed site, they must face a horrifying reality: Schools out--welcome to Battle Royale. Director Fukasaku made the right decision to have actor Takeshi Kitano as the former school teacher who is the one in charge of this latest group of competitors. Who better for the role?. As the former school teacher of this new group chosen to compete in this years game of survival, he makes it a point early in the film to set the tone by letting the students know that this BATTLE ROYALE is no joke.

And the point Takeshi Kitano makes with a couple of students in the beginning of the film is not lost on the other students. The students must kill each other in order to survive. Only when ONE of the students is left standing will the game come to an end. It is here where you see loyalties and friendships part ways, or strengthen. I like the way Kinji Fukasaku directed the film. This is not like ""Lord of the Flies"" as I read in one of the reviews. ""Battle Royale"" is a totally different take on a future 21st-century society of ADULTS, that have come to see unruly students as having to be dealt with severely in order to conform to a Japanese society that THEY feel is being threatened.

I would suggest to not to watch it with kids as some scenes could be misinterpreted; for example it is hard to explain that hacking someone with a icepick could be a positive experience for all parties involved.

Also the manga gets a little boring at times and is more of a porno than anything else.  The movie has great acting and is never hard to understand. Its also not 'too artsy'.  its perfect.  It is way better than the second one.  Every character is fully developed and most have back stories.  Its hard to do that in any movie especially one where there are so many characters.

Others just hide and simply defends oneself. Others committed suicide just to be able to get out of the ""game"". Others banded together to be able to find an escape or break the game. It's really interesting how each individual reacted to the horrific situation that they're in. ""Would you kill your best friend or a loved one? Would you kill anyone for that matter?"".

The book was excellent in both plot, development, action, suspense, and surprises galore. BR is my absolute fave book of all time, hands down.
  Now on to the movie. The BR movie had a lot of discrepancies that made me stare into the cathode ray tube of my TV and scream ""WTF?!"" the dream that Noriko has in the movie was a major WTF moment. Then Kitano's painting of all the dead students with Noriko standing in the center of it with a golden halo of light.(?) Kazou Kiriyama and Shogo Kawada's being ""chosen"" to liven up the game was totally off. The timeline was skewed a bit too.

Now I know that book-to-film adaptations are rarely all they're cracked up to be. But this was an atrocity. The book was amazing and rightfully claims a seat on my ""Top 5 Books of All Time"" List. The movie took everything that was good with the book and threw it out the window. Yes, the skeleton of the story is mostly there but continuity is horrible, special effects are even worse, and the acting is the absolute worst I've ever seen in my life...period.

What I really want to write about here are the details about this particular DVD edition.  It is, indeed, a region-free DVD and should, therefore, be viewable with any DVD player.  This edition was apparantly produced specifically for the US and other English-speaking nations as the information on the case cover is entirely in English.  I suspect that it is possibly a bootleg but the quality is great! The transfer is very good and the subtitles are excellent!  This disc contains a lot of interesting special features, most of which also contain good English subtitles.

I previously purchased a 2-disc Korean version of this movie also containing English subtitles.  For the most part, the subtitles here are the same as the Korean edition.  However, the subtitles are more clearly presented in the this edition and are better timed!  Also, there are a few occasions (not many, but they are there) in the Korean edition where the subtitles don't make a bit of sense.  That problem has been corrected in this edition.  The special features on this disc appear to be the same as those on the second disc of the Korean edition.  The Korean disc, however, does not have subtitles for any of the special features.

All in all, this Uncut Special Edition of Battle Royale (labelled Battle Royale Directors Cut on Amazon) appears to be about the best version available for American audiences!  Unfortunately, this excellent film has never been distributed domestically in the US, and it probably never will.  There has been some confusion about this.  Many people are under the impression that Battle Royale has been banned in the US.  This is simply not true.  Battle Royale was a blockbuster in the Japanese theaters upon its original release in 2000.  Therefore, Toei studios is demanding far more money for US distribution rights than any US distributor would ever be willing to pay.

I would highly recommend this movie for fans of thought-provoking action movies!  There are many versions available.  So be careful when making your selection.",1151884800,6,2294,4.932114882506528

1442145,5,B00005JL9A,"The 61st film of 70-year old director Kinji Fukasaku, BATTLE ROYALE begins with a prologue:

  ""At the dawn of the millennium the nation collapsed.  At 15% unemployment, 10 million were out of work.  800,000 students boycotted school.  The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act AKA the BR Act.""

  While the logic of instating the BR Act due to the downturn of the Japanese economy is tenuous at best, BATTLE ROYALE screams into action and doesn't allow time to ponder such issues.  After a few scenes setting up core characters--Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko (Aki Maeda)--the forty-two high schoolers become trapped on a remote island where they're reintroduced to their seventh grade teacher, Kitano (brilliantly played by ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano).

  ""This country's become no good,"" Kitano says.  ""The bigwigs got together and passed [the BR Act].  So today's lesson is... you kill each other off.  `Till there's only one left.  There's nothing against the rules.""

  Armed with a random ""weapon"" (some get semi-automatic guns, some get less lethal implements like cookwear), each student has three days to dispatch his or her classmates in hope of being the last one standing.  Again, there is little time for logic and no room for pacifism. Playing like a high-stakes version of Martin Campbell's island prison adventure NO ESCAPE, BATTLE ROYALE finds fuel in the heightened melodrama of adolescence.  As these kids struggle to stay alive, classroom rivalries skyrocket and doe-eyed crushes become heavyweight love affairs.

  Shuya, whose father abandoned him by taking his own life, becomes the stand-in for the audience as well as the prototypical Japanese.  Struggling in this microcosm of Japan, Shuya is a young man without a father as Japan is a country without a strong leader.  Meanwhile, the only male role model for Shuya appears to be Kitano, the slump-shouldered former teacher plagued with family problems of his own.

  BATTLE ROYALE has its moments of ""score-keeping"" via graphics that appear, tallying the names of those who have died as well as how many students are left.  As the body count goes higher, director Fukasaku keeps raising the stakes, never relenting in this dogged contest.  Cleverly, BATTLE ROYALE doesn't appear as an outright parody.  Rather, it takes melodrama to the nth degree.  The film's score booms with emotionally riveting classical pieces, giving the proceedings an operatic tinge.",1149120000,15,2501,5.2639593908629445

If it was darker, more serious, about a group of school kids that are forced to kill each other, it probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable. But as it is where else do you get to watch 40+ people die in the most imaginative (and dare I say sometimes comical) sort of ways. Don't get me wrong, there are a few moving quiet moments, but as a whole if you enjoy the blood-splattering 60's and 70's Asian films then you are bound to love BR.

1442207,5,B00005JL9A,"Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 film ""Battle Royale"" has attracted fans from all over the world with its controversy and ultraviolence. Set in an alternate reality, a ninth grade class is outfitted with weapons and food for a few days, let loose on an evacuated island, and forced to kill one another until only one is left standing. Electronic collars around their necks keep track of their movements and ensure that the ""players"" don't do anything suspicious. The forty-two students involved in the game face a great dilemma: what do you do? Which friends can you trust, if any? Do you run and hide, commit suicide, find your friends and hope for the best, or... play the game? With danger and death looming around every corner, these students must make decisions that reflect their character, decisions that ultimately decide their fate.

The movie itself is totally unlike anything you'll see coming from the United States. The adolescent violence is a constant theme, never allowing the viewer to breathe for too long. Touching exchanges between the ill-fated characters provide a strong dramatic element to go along with the action. And, believe it or not, there is some great black humor thrown in to boot. Though not for the faint of heart, Battle Royale is an incredible tale of will and survival, and it challenges its viewers to think about what they would do in a similar situation.

Notable for his acting is the great Takeshi Kitano, who plays the students' former teacher and runs the Battle Royale program this time around. Tatsuya Fujiwara (Nanahara) and Aki Maeda (Noriko) are the main characters, and most of the action revolves around them and what they see. Taro Yamamoto (Kawada) plays a mysterious ""transfer"" into the class, and his motives are unknown to the others. Chiaki Kuriyama (Chigusa) of Kill Bill fame catches the eye of more than one student, and shows that she can do far more than swing a ball and chain. Kou Shibasaki (Mitsuko) and Masanobu Ando (Kiriyama) round out the main cast as two wild students who aim to mow down everyone in their path.

The DVD is a special version of the original film, with about eight additional minutes of footage involved. These extra scenes add some backstory to many of the characters and highlight what life was like before they were chosen for the game. Recurring scenes of a basketball game show the unity of the class - a stark contrast to what the rules of the game suggest, and what they force these kids to do. There are also some additional shots of the students' reactions. The action is digitally enhanced, with the gunshots sounding louder and the blood splattering further than in the original version.

The special features, absent in the original DVD release of the film, show that the actors and actresses really are just kids. Most of the features show them having a good time and enjoying themselves on set. Some promotional material and short interviews with the cast and director are included as well. Not all of the special features are subtitled in English, but the subtitles that are used are top-notch, especially in the feature film.

The room goes quiet, it's not a game, although a perky lady on the TV guiding them through the rules prompts them in a manner rather like a street fighter manual.
The kids lose their lip, its real.
They have to fight to the last man standing, only ONE out of the whole class of over 40 souls will be allowed to live.
The kids, whether they be good, bad or ugly have one choice, kill, or be killed.
They are sent out with backpacks into the vastness of an island, they are warned that every four hours a different part of the island will be a hot spot, bombs etc will be dropped, this is to avoid the kids all holing up, to keep them moving and exposed.
As a further kick to the children, every morning and evening their teacher reads to them over the loudspeaker the names of all the children who have been killed during that time frame, each kid is wearing a heart monitor around their necks which cannot be removed so their last hours and movements can be tracked.
The ultimate kick comes from a few of the children and the way they took to killing.  Ducks to water.  They were each supplied with weapons in their backpacks, some got guns, some got knives and some got pans!
A few comic elements of the darkest variety and well sketched 'kill' scenes made this a very memorable movie.  It's quite long by todays standards but I wasn't left feeling it was TOO long.  It was action packed, sometimes heart breaking and sometimes darkly funny.

1442211,5,B00005JL9A,"The movie is just entertaing from start to finish. I liked how it tackled things like trust, friendship and love when put in dire situations with fellow peers. For those of you who have not read the novel ,troubled teens have practically taken over schools, mocking teachers and adults alike. In order to regain some sort of stability in a once adult dominated society, they have formed a new law where students are forced into a live action game of kill or be killed in what the government has dubbed  the BR Act or Bttle Royale. Specifically, the teens are put on a deserted island where each one has to fend off against each other, with the hopes of being the last one standing and receive their ticket home. So essentialy there are two ways to leave the island kill everyone(including friends) or be killed by them, and they got three days to do it. So, you may wonder why not try and leave the island or just hide until the three days are up. We'll each one of them has a metal collar, which is basically a means to keep them moving and if any of them get out of line or if the three days are up then BOOM! That's right it blows up. There are dangerzones that are activated over a certain period of time, and if your caught in one the collar will explode, so hangin out in the bushes is not going to work for long. Now judging from the plot it's safe to say that there a lot death and violence, and the fact these are real teenagers playing these characters makes it as controversial as the book. One of the most intresting aspects of the film would be to see how each one of these students would fine a way to killthem selves or others. We have the love struck suicides to the [...] gung-ho type that takes on five at a time. Another great aspect is how they had to work with what they got. Before they went into the field each student received a backpack full of supplies that would last them three days they had. Some were lucky to have guns while others were not as luckyand had objects like trash can lid and binoculars.

1442212,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale.... Wow, what a movie viewing experience. First off I have to commend the director, Kinji Fukasaku (who directed over 50+ films in Japan) for actually having the nerve to direct such a movie. I personally could not classify what genre this film is, but it is definitely in the realm of ""horror"" and here is why...

The Synopsis:  The turn of the century.  Japan is on the brink of collapse.  Fearing rising indiscipline and rebellion amongst the youth of the nation, authorities pass the Millennium Educational Reform Act, allowing the implementation of the `Battle Royale' programme: classes of 14 and 15 year-olds are chosen at random and sent to a remote island where they are given weapons and three days to kill one another, until the sole survivor emerges as the winner.

As I viewed this film (and I have seen a LOT of Japanese films) I felt very sad for what these kids, or should I say ""children"" had to experience, but here I was, experiencing this tragic roller-coaster ride right there with them. From the opening SECONDS of Battle Royale, I was caught up in the mayhem and it did not let go until the credits started rolling.

You have to understand that the majority of these kids don't want to kill their classmates, some unfortunately do, but for the most part, most don't want too. They are chosen to carry the burden of what society deems as the ""rebellious youth"". They are the ones that are to be made the example of what happens when you disregard ""authority"". What makes this all the more tragic is that this particular group of students are not the ones that should be battling; they are not the indiscipline youth, they are not the rebellious youth, they are not disregarding authority. What they are though, are just regular children who have dreams and aspirations, and who just wanted to lead a normal school life...until they are thrust in to the ""Millennium Educational Reform Act aka BATLLE ROYALE PROGRAM"".

As for technical side of the movie; I would have to say the Kinji Fukasaku directed what I considered one of his best movies. The movie is tightly paced and never let's up; Kinji let's you breathe for perhaps a moment but then he hits you unexpectedly. Great direction.

As you probably have heard before, this movie is extremely violent, but it is certainly not senseless. It is not the violence that is shocking in B.R., it is the realization of who is performing the violent acts that are truly haunting. The children are forced to kill or be killed, nothing more, nothing less.

As for the music, it contains well-known classical pieces as well as having it's own classical pieces that plays throughout the movie. It presents the movie with a sense of a being a sort of tragic stage play.

The acting was very believable for the most part, each character displaying emotions such as fear, shyness, deception, love, jealousy, humiliation and helplessness with convincing potrayals. What is great about each character is that it hurts you when every one of them dies, because they are that REAL. I particularly enjoyed Takeshi Kitano's performance of the school teacher, I truly believe he wasn't acting at all, it was just him playing himself.

So is Battle Royale a masterpiece? I would have to say ""YES"" simply for the fact that after viewing the film, you will never forget it. It is a beautifully haunting piece of cinema that will thoroughly exhaust you by the end of the movie but also invite you into the deeper interpretation that the film provides. Definitely check BATTLE ROYALE out.",1142208000,5,3549,4.7544715447154475
1442213,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale is a movie based on new age problems, such as teen suicide, school murders, and the lack of respect that today's youth has or has had for superiors. It's a surreal response to all of these elements of modern society (and despite being a Japanese film, this is especially true for the United States). In the near future, teenagers have decided that they don't want to follow the same rules they've been following for ages. Teachers now fear for their lives, and students boycott the system. In order to put a stop to this, the BR Act was instituted, yet none of the students have no idea about this... until they are apart of the Act. Basically, the BR Act allows the adults to send children and students off to a secluded island to kill each other off.

That's just what happens to a class of forty-two students, with two mysterious transfer students included in that. Once introduced to their class, and given the rules of game, they are sent off with a bag of provisions and a randomly chosen weapon. Sometimes, the weapons can as useless as a pair of binoculars, or as effective as grenades. It's all the luck of the draw, and whether or not the student is able to adapt to the game and earn the weapons on their own. Some students do just that, while others choose different ways of escaping the game. And then there are those who choose instead not to fight at all, but to unite and try to figure out a way to save themselves. Yet the rules of the game may force even those of a more peaceful ilk to kill the ones they trust.

What's good about Battle Royale is that, though there are numerous characters and plenty of sub-plots, it never gets bogged-down with an over-populated cast. There are heroes, neutral forces, as well as those who are pure evil. Another good part of this movie is the constantly rising tension, and how the characters react to this. As the game gets deeper, the characters emotions begin to fray. Though surely a fantasy, it seems that everything that happens to these students because of the BR Act could be possible, should our world ever reach the point it does in Battle Royale.

The one problem I had with Battle Royale, though, was the subtitles. At times they ran out of the edge of the screen, making it impossible to read, and at other times they just weren't grammatical. The wrong words were used in many places, and sometimes the subtitles made no sense at all, whether they were written grammatically or not. Though the acting makes a lot of what's being said clear, there are times when this still gets frustrating.

Despite that, though, the movie is excellent. It has plenty of surprises, a good ending, and a lot of great action. Plus, it has the common Japanese elements, like the super-violence and gore. To add, the story is great, and the characters are well-acted. I'd recommend this movie to any fan of Asian cinema, especially Japanese horror fans.

Teenagers are boycotting school, physically abusing their teachers, and others that actually go to school are always truant, so the government decides to pass the BR act. A class of teenagers are drugged and are sent to an abandoned island and are forced to kill each other within 72 hours, leaving only one person alive. They all get a weapon, as well as a bag containing food, water, and a map. Their ""sensei"" (teacher) gives updates every six hours, detailing where the ""danger zones"" are, and who has been killed recently, or killed since the BR began. Now, they have the option to get revenge on someone they despise, and have to sacrifice their friends in order to stay alive. Who'd have thought a bunch of school kids slaughtering each other would make such an incredible movie? Recommended.

As for the DVD, Apparently Toei (the copyright owners of the film) hasn't licensed it to a US distributor and they've rejected a few offers. The movie was a huge hit in Japan and Toei figured they'd get a big theatrical release in the US and decided to wait until they did. Unfortunately the movie was made in 1999. Anybody remember what happened that year? Columbine. So as you can imagine, it was a while before any US distributor would even think about releasing this movie. By the time the heat from that wore off, the region zero and bootlegs were all over the place and distributors saw the value of a DVD release but not theatrical. Toei wants a U.S. theatrical release before the U.S. gets an official DVD release.

I was very excited to watch this but I was severely disappointed.

It started out ok.  They presented the game and how 42(?) Japanese students would be brought to an island and would have to kill each other until only one survived, in a mildly humorous fashion.

But that was mediocre at best and was the end of anything interesting right at the start.

The rest of the movie is spent watching the students kill each other in uninteresting fashion.  So the reputation of outrageous violence turned out to be false in my opinion.

The major problem however is that there are too many possible relationships between 42(?) students to have time to examine them in the movie.

Obviously, the film doesn't examine them all, but it does do too many.  This movie continually presents a background relationship and resolves it with killing, all within a few minutes.  Then the same thing again and again. You never get to be involved with any of the characters' relationships before one kills another and you are presented with another one.

It's all pretty boring.  A huge disappointment.",1134691200,8,1259,4.684931506849315
1442257,4,B00005JL9A,"[The following is for the review of the 2 disc special edition DVD version of Battle Royale]

First off let me start off by saying that all together this is a great film, with some kick butt action sequences, awesome plot, cool twists along the way and just a downright awesome feel. However, there are a number of things which take away from the film's overall powerful appeal (and overall quality).

One of the major problems with the film is that it comes across as ""dark humor"" or ""slapstick"" in many ways (the awkward music playing while someone is getting their head bashed in with an axe), and dead people getting up and talking just make the film come across as ""amusing."" But wait, that isn't to say this movie, is a comedy at all and that isn't to say comedy is a bad thing (especially here)!

I'm half sure the ""dark humor"" aspects of the film were designed to make it a ""cult classic"" and appeal to large audiences in much the same way other dark humor type films have in the past. Likewise, if taken for what it is in conjunction with some of the gruesome aspects of the film as well as the interesting storyline, it leads (in my opinion) to a very neat film (if not a strong one).

One reviewer said that the film was ""disturbing."" I'm going to have to disagree simply because of the slapstick nature in which brutal killings take place throughout the movie (sure if you have a weak heart you might find the film overbearing at times, but I certainly didn't). Are the murders senseless and without style? No, in fact the style literally is the dark humor, as cheesy as that is when we are asked to take the storyline seriously at times.

So all and all the humorous aspects in the film both take away from it as well as provide a backdrop for much of the brutality throughout the film. Recently I've heard a number of American reviewers mention that the problem is that the film is both a foreign film as well as a low budget film - these two can be contributing factors as many Americans who rent the film on Netflix and or at their video store are certainly under the impression they are about to watch a ""serious"" film (whether or not this is thought exclusively by Americans I do not know, perhaps the film was marketed similarly in Japan).

For the reasons previously mentioned this cannot be considered a ""serious film,"" rather perhaps it can be considered a ""strange/good film"" in that it is too humorous to be serious and too serious to resemble a comedy in the slightest (and yes I think that unfortunately means people will either like it or hate it for what it is).

The end of the films suffers from poor subtitle translations as well as an overly ""exhausted"" feeling. Closure of the film occurs 5 minutes before the actual film's end, the actual ending is full of useless images of the film's characters playing together (giving us even more useless images of how bad it was that friends were fighting with each other as well as how some of the individuals lived secluded lives, perhaps lending to some kind of rationality for why they gave into violence as they had).

I'm going to have to disagree with any sort of opinion that says major psychological themes played a large role in the movie. Certainly they were there (it would be foolish to ignore them completely), but given the slapstick way in which the movie was handled at times it seems as though they were dulled throughout most of the movie and only resurrect themselves later at the film's ""actual ending.""

All and all this is a great film as I mentioned earlier. I would have actually liked the film to focus more on the psychological trauma perhaps felt by the youngsters throughout the film. Unfortunately I believe it fails to do this and it leaves it up to the audience to decide whether or they want to place a strong emphasis on such things when recalling the film long after watching it.

Again, great film that should have taken itself a bit more seriously in my opinion - I love and accept it for what it is though, and I feel that a large majority of viewers will feel the same. Try it today!",1131580800,,4095,4.462566844919786

1442259,2,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)

I committed what may be the cardinal sin where watching movies based on books is concerned-- I saw the film less than a year after I read the book. I have always hypothesized that this was the reason for my, shall we say, overly hostile reaction to Malick's desecration of James Jones' brilliant novel The Thin Red Line; at least I can say with some authority that I didn't hate Battle Royale anywhere near as badly as I hated The Thin Red Line.

Most of my problem with the film adaptation comes from changes that were made to the events in the book that didn't need making in any way, shape, or form (for example, the timing of Yukiko and Yumiko's deaths, which comes later in the novel, or, most notably, Kawada's assertion that Kiriyama ""signed up"" for the game, which changes the whole atmosphere). There are some things that, we're all aware by now, simply don't translate well to the screen (e.g., the portions of the novel where Takami goes into Kiriyama's mental state), and those were forgiven before the movie started rolling. Still, there were some changes made that those who have already read the novel will find unforgivable, if not unconscionable.

The plot of the movie, as thin as it is, has excited a good deal of controversy: in an alternate-world Japan, the government has instituted a yearly Battle Royale, where a high school class picked at random is sent to an out-of-the-way island and forced to kill one another until there is a single survivor. The controversy seems to be over the ages of the subjects, given that as far as the actual action is concerned, this is pretty standard thriller fare (there's nothing in the film even remotely as disturbing as the ""curbing"" scene from American History X, for example). One of the most amusing things about the movie is that those unnecessary changes made to the novel while it was adapted are the only places in the film where truly gaping holes arise in the premise (it's impossible to go into detail without major spoilers, so I'll just say that some of the characters' ages couldn't possibly mesh with this being one high school class [IMDB specifies they're a ninth-grade class]; this is confirmed during a critical piece of dialogue about two-thirds of the way through the film).

If you're looking for a solid action flick with a high body count, you don't care about plot holes, and you haven't read the book, you'll probably greatly enjoy Battle Royale; I know many people who have. If you've read the book, however, I urge you to avoid the movie. **",1128988800,9,2569,4.702222222222222
1442260,5,B00005JL9A,"What a movie! This is got to be up there in my fav movies of all time. I would give it a title like horror or action but it really does not fit into a catagory of film.

A class is randomly selected to participate in the battle royale a law passed to clean up scociety by basically killing an intire 9th grade class. how you ask. by giving them wepons on a deserted island sending them off with exploding dog collars and giving them 3 days to have one student hailed as the winner. If those three days are up all the collars will explode. Imagine what it would be like to have to kill your best friend or girl friend to save your own life. Could you even do it? thats what battle royale makes you ask yourself. Is the human instinct of survival that strong to make you kill the people you love. this is just one hell of a movie with a unrelenting story and a question of human survival.",1128729600,2,886,4.091954022988506
1442261,5,B00005JL9A,"""Battle Royale"" is a superb film, subtle and sad and over-the-top and loud all at the same time. The story is often compared to ""Lord of the Flies,"" but that is a bit of a misnomer. ""Lord of the Flies"" was about reverting to primitivism, whereas ""Battle Royale"" is a futuristic cautionary tale in the tune of ""1984"" and ""Brave New World."" The caution at work here is the threat of absolute bureaucracy, and the dangers of the loss of the value of life and respect in a rules-dominated society. This is a threat quite apparent in modern Japan.

The actors in ""Battle Royale"" all deliver excellent performances, including the amazing talent ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano playing the appropriately named ""Kitano."" The film was not directed by Takeshi however, so it lacks his beautiful visual style. It does however feature one of his riveting paintings. There is a good range of responses from the various actors playing the students, from outright suicide, to panic, to a drive to win to a drive to help. Unfortunately, the character of Kazuo Kiriyama (the machine gun boy) is woefully underdeveloped, and instead of the fierce, cold genius of the book he is a somewhat characterless villain.

While a violent film, I wouldn't characterize ""Battle Royale"" as an action film per se. Anyone looking for a Hong Kong-style action film should realize that Japan and China are quite different countries with different approach to movies.. ""Battle Royale"" retains the quietude and patient pacing that is the hallmark of Japanese cinema, and which leaves some viewers bored, who are used to a quicker pacing. The bloodshed, while in great quantity, is also more cartoony in nature, which is also more typical of Japanese films, which does not favor a naturalistic approach.

I think some familiarity with problems in modern Japan (ie: school violence, overwhelming bureaucracy) gives some necessary perspective to this controversial movie, and helps frame it as more than exploitation. It is a political statement, with a subtle message underlying the overt violence. Along with this, knowledge of Japanese culture deepens the understandings of certain scenes, such as when Kitano performs the prescribed exercises, and the training video shown at the beginning. Without understanding, these scenes might come off as merely quaint or odd.",1127260800,56,2321,5.118733509234828
1442262,5,B00005JL9A,"Reading the summary of this movie/ book/ manga, you will probably see some dumb description about how children are put on an island and forced to kill each other. While this is true, it does not do the story justice. This is not a horror or slasher flick- it shows the terrible way human minds can bend when put in the most horrible of circumstances. [...] (It was created before the novel was brought over from Japan to the US.) You will not regret it for it is free and a very good translation.
Please keep in mind! While this is an amazing story, the movie, book, and manga are very, very different. I would suggest the book as the best of three as it is the easiest to get, cheapest, the original format, and by far the best. The movie is an absolute must-see although very hard to get in most places. The manga is (in my humble opinion) the least format. It is far more violent, sexually perverse, and offensive than the others without adding much quality or information. Also, like most manga, there are many installments (14, I think and still going) each one about [...]. Very expensive if not just read in store. (However kudos to the artist(s) for being amazing with emotion.)
There is a sequal (in movie format only) which is very good but under NO circumstances should you see it before the first. I highly recommend Battle Royale!",1126915200,4,1343,4.485714285714286

The music of this movie is just outstanding. Some of it lightens the mood; especially when the Blue Danube Waltz plays after 12 children are killed. While others give the scene a tragic mood using vocalization.

The fact that this movie will not see a US release dissapoints me. Not because I live in the US, but because our society needs the message that this movie gives out. In fact, many other ""gore-fests"" appear in the US that are way worse than Battle Royale. Such examples would include Ichi the Killer and Suicide Club (Suicide Circle).

There are people who want to survive togeter(The couple that is the main focus) Guys who fend for theirselves(The foriegn exchange student, and that one chick with a cicle)and one who helps if nessaccery(The doctor dude).  But there are many others who have ideas about diffrent things, but one thing they must realize.  If no one wins, everyone looses.

This movie has some pretty graphic violence, and quite a bit of language.  So definitly not for kids, people who are just plain out weak, nor people who don't like seeing wemon get slaughtered.

I also love the acting in this movie.  The people scream and yell at serious times, and when it seems hopless, they just give the feeling that they're seriously going to give up.  I mean the actig in this is serious, none of that fake horror crap, straight up serious.

The 2 things I hate about this film was weapon selection,  (I mean who is going to kill someone with a trash can lid, let-alone binochulars.  And if someone has a pistol aming 20 feet away, can oyu attempt to kill them with a stun-gun) and Chiakii Kuriyama's small role.  She didn't play much(She didn't play much in Kill Bill netiher)  But still, she had a name pretty high in the castlines.

Well all in all, this movie makes Kill Bill, Versus, and weak crap that people say is nice, look like boy scouts.  This film is definitly recomended to those who like the films above should

1442301,5,B00005JL9A,"To begin with, yes, I rented this video because I'd heard that it was a very controversial film- a bloody tale in which a class of high school kids are forced to play cat and mouse and kill each other until only one remains.

And yes, I received that. But I was completely shocked that I also got a very serious, character-driven, emotional drama. If you're into this movie because of the violence, don't worry, you'll be happy. But for those quick to turn away because they think this will be another crazy, senseless, far-out Japanese trash film? I have to tell you- you're very wrong. I went into this film wanting to see just how flashy and violent it would be, and walked away from it with a much higher opinion. This movie didn't insult my intelligence with two hours of nonsense. Instead, it captivated me with emotional tales of life, loss, love, and friendship. These kids aren't just disposable fodder. The movie makes sure we understand that they all had lives and dreams.

The film's premise is explained quickly but paced expertly: In a future Asia, things are horrible and some adults have rebelled against the youth that spites them. One man in particular, a high school teacher, goes with his unruly class on a field trip. They're shocked to find themselves being hustled into a room under supervision of armed militants and told that their lives are at an end. Each of the 40 kids are given a bag of rations and a random weapon, and shoved out onto an isolated island where they must kill each other, or be killed themselves.

As strange as this may sound, I was surprised at how well these scenes played out. These kids are fine actors. Extreme disbelief, shock, rage, confusion, terror- it's all on their faces as they slowly take this message in. Some rebel and are quickly disposed of. Others fly into rage at what they see. Most others however shrink into the corners of the small room and try their best to accept the impossible fate before them. Soon though, the music goes low and the faces get stark as the kids are rushed, one by one, out into the wilderness. They look at their friends and hastily embrace for what they know will probably be the last time.

As I said, there is of course a lot of violence in the film. It's comparable to the first Kill Bill, or perhaps the original Robocop. But the controversy following this film is due simply to its theme of high schoolers killing high schoolers, and also due to the film's dark tone. I reiterate: This isn't a rocking, stylistic gun glamorization. Some of these kids fall backwards in fear, not wanting to fire upon their friends. Others recoil in shock when they do what's required. Others simply attempt suicide to free themselves of the burden. The subject of this movie is not taken lightly. The mood is dark, the situation desperate.

Driving things home are vignettes of the kids. Often, we're given glimpses of these people's lives. We see exuberance of youth- a shy boy trying to find a way to let a girl know he likes her. A girl who's happy to bring cookies to her friends for the field trip. Another boy who just lost his father and is trying to cope. The basketball game where these kids last shared their lives together. This film is about loss, primarily evidenced by the loss of innocence and youth that these kids experience when they know they have to kill their best friends. Heightening the film is a gorgeous, poetic soundtrack of classical music that is expertly juxtaposed against the agony and misery that these people have to go through.

The film makes sense, has a well-paced, intelligent narrative, and interesting circumstances. Some kids can't handle what's happening, others glory in it. Some are experts, some are terrified. Something important is constantly going on, and by the end, it's a sad, moving piece of human drama regardless of who wins- if anyone. Well acted, well scored, with raw and realistic dialog, and fantastic direction.

Yes, if you strip away all narrative, this is a movie about kids killing each other. But to my pleasant shock, it was also one of the most moving, emotional dramas about life and loss that I've ever seen. And not just life, but what it means to live.",1112054400,3,4206,4.6375838926174495

1442304,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale is essentially a mix of high school movies, Lord of the Flies, Fortress (the movie that stars Christopher Lambert), The Running Man, and reality TV, among others. With this strange mix, what we have is a pretty entertaining movie about teen angst and social commentary.

Its violent content is slightly overrated since it is not as gory as hyped.  It's not as gratuitious as some Hollywood movies, although the act of seeing kids killing each other will surely test the uninitiated.  In fact, such scenes will make one think about the pointlessness of violence. A violent anti-violence film, if you would.

The film succeeds since we get to know the kids and their friendships, then they are forced to kill each other to survive. Such displays of character depth are important to make us emphatize with their dilemma.  This aspect of the plot has also surfaced in the pop-samurai flick Azumi and the Korean historical drama Silmido.

The acting is believable, given the outlandish plot, since the kids are acting their age.  But what steals the movie is Takeshi Kitano's weary school teacher. His final scene with the phone call was truly hilarious and unexpected.

directed by Kinji Fukasaku

2000, 114 mins.

Damn kids these days. Won't listen, no sir. Don't go to school anymore. Fieldtrips, though. Definitely.

Place: a remote island. More specifically: some dark room on that very island. Filled with a bunch of damn kids. And soldiers, and Kitano. Yup, our favorite Japanese actor/director/poker-face 'Beat' Takashi Kitano. He introduces the students, nay, 'students' (hell, if you don't go to school, you're no student either) to our favorite game: Battle Royale. By now, we have all heard about it, yes, we all know what Battle Royale is, but the kids are, of course, clueless. However, the rules are quickly explained (including a more than delightful instruction video) and well, let the games begin. The kids are supposed to kill eachother, and only one can remain when 72 hours have passed.

This is of course a great story for a movie (or manga, or, initially, book), and, glad to say this, Battle Royale delivers. The acting is more than just mediocre (Kitano is great; the 'I'm-dying-hold-me-while-I-say-my-last-words' scenes are laughable though), the action is superior. Some good plot twists add to the good feeling the movie gives you, and with a nice ending it definitely satisfies. Add to that Chiaki Kuriyama, Aki Maeda, and Kou Shibasaki, and you know you gotta watch this.

As for the gore, this movie doesn't totally let you down. Although not tremendously graphic and explicit, there's some nice and brutal scenes in there. Scary? Not at all, but that's not the point. Battle Royale is an extreme adrenaline rush, which really must be experienced. Although it hasn't officialy been released in the US, one should really try to get his hands on a copy (import or something): don't miss it.

mos says:

Scares? 1/10

Gore? 5/10 (it's there, but it's not so explicit at times)

Number of cute Japanese schoolgirls? A nice collection/10

1442358,5,B00005JL9A,"Before I saw this movie, I was quite troubled with this movie. First I had read the back of the DVD saying that young teenagers killing each other... This kind of plot was the kind of plot that would make an awful movie of senseless violence and just plain psychotic and not a movie worth seeing. The reason I saw this movie was because of it's controversy. People in japan tried to oppose the movie from being released and since it has been released, I want to see how Contro. it is. and I also Like foreign Films.

Battle royale's plot is that japan has gone into a corrupt society, along with the corruption, the country's youth has gone rebellious: 800,000 students boycott school. The government cannot control hundreds of thousands of rebellious teenagers and therefore have to force classes into participating in battle Royale. Once the class is there, they get a kit with food and water, compass, flash light and a random weapon. three days limit of killing and surviving. There is only one winner. If there are more than one, the necklaces the students wear will explode and all dies.

To tell the truth, After seeing this movie, it made me really love this film. The movie was just made really well. Irespect that people would want to avoid this film because of it's plot. Yes, there is killing but I rather say this film is about survival, courage, fierce loyalty, friendship and decisions.

ACTING: No doubt in a film, acting is the most important inorder for the film to really capture the realism of it. The young actors we see aren't the ones we see in hopeless and funny ( not litterally) movies which makes us laugh because of the stupid acting. Here in battle Royale, we see true talent emerge. In a story of survival, acting is very important, WE see people in BR crying, screaming, arguing in situations that would be the most horrendous. WE also see hapiness when there is a happy moment and we can feel the character's emnotion and really get into the movie.

SCREENPLAY: The screen play I cannot really judge because I cannot 100 % fully understand japanese, but the subtitles are quite good. I can understand everything. Forget the stupid pirated ones when the subtitles don't match the image. The subtitles are well made and are suitable for foreign viewers like myself.

Direction: Kinji Fukasaku is was 70 years old when he made battle royale, I respect this fine director for making an incredible movie and for his enthusiasm to make it into a successful one. Because of his energy into making battle royale, His direction of Battle royale is really nice. We see nice scenery and by seeing documentaries, we see Kinji Fukasaku being a true perfectionist. (in the scene were kitano slaps Nobbuo, he had to do it many times to make the scene perfect , sdlap after slap after slap...""ouch"")

Thats why this film is really perfect because of his good direction. I haven't read the book but a 400+ page book into a near 2 hour movie, he's done a good job...

The issue of violence: Before the movie, the violence is the main thing that stands out, when you finished the film, the violence don't get in the way. AS I said before, the movie is about the act of survaival not based on violence...  the violence isn't for entertainment but to capture the fear and emotion of the situation. Where we see a child die by machine guns, we feel sorry for the student and feel sorry for all of them who have to go through this situation. I felt sad about this movie and I thought this a movie more about tragedy than senseless killing.

Excitement: The excitement in Battle Royale is really good. It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, will all of the murdering, emotion and fantastic acting make Battle royale very entertaining.

Conclusion: IN a movie, conclusion is very important, Battle royale's conclusion is very nice and not stupid, the movie ends in a very satisfying way ( but can confuse some viewers) but the problem is that when the credits roll, lifting pop music starts to roll.....]

Music: The use of Classical music is very powerful. I loved the theme in the beggining. and the music by bach: air string on G.

It actually suits really, really well with the movie.

The original score is also done really well. I don't know the composer but I noticed the richness of the orchestration and the correct emotion to suit the image in screen. well done

OVERALL::::

BATTLE ROYALE is one of the BEST Japanese movie I have ever seen, the movie has a very original plot and it stands out over other movies. To undertsnat this movie, you must look deep in the movie and you'll see what kind of movie Fukasaku (director) has made with Battle Royale",1097625600,4,4683,4.591616766467066
1442359,5,B00005JL9A,"Like some of the other reviewers here, I had read the more-easily-obtained book before seeing the movie - enjoying it very much - and went in knowing the premise. To begin with, Battle Royale, in all its forms, is an exceptional work of creative fiction, and I think that of its three forms (movie, book and manga), the movie may well be the best.

In praise of Battle Royale in general, it is first of all a very engaging and moving story, with a simple yet carefully thought-out premise, an intricate plot and compelling human dynamics. I knew that much when I read the book. But the movie has increased the entire product in my estimation, and deserves a good deal of praise seperate from and above the book.

For one thing, I think the film is more moving. It really brings home how horrible and tragic the premise is; which is sometimes lost in the pulpy exuberance with which the plot of the book unfolds. The actors convey the situation of utterly doomed children so perfectly, conveying all the shadings of paranoia, hatred and outright psychosis; it really must have been a feat to find so many young, good actors. The film's biggest surprise, though, is the change that was made to the 'villain,' played here by the legendary Beat Takeshi. What was a stock evil character in the novel becomes a richer, more striking, although perhaps not entirely consistent personality in the film, giving it an emotional dimension even beyond the game itself.

I think the movie handles the violence about right. It doesn't cut away from the gore, but there's no excessive spurting of blood. The fight scenes aren't immaculately choreographed, but that may be for the best, considering what the film is really about.

There are two other touches in the film which I think are absolutley brilliant - which won't mean anything to people who haven't seen it, but to those who have, and are in the habit of reading reviews of products they've already bought in order to contrast their own opinions - weren't the instructional video and the 'radio exercises' pure genius?

There are a couple of totally minor points on which I thought the movie stumbled. For one thing, although of course they had to cut out a lot of substance to fit the running time, they cut out some of the best characters and interactions, such as Sho Tsukioka and Mitsuko's elaborately treacherous dispatching of the pair of boys.  I also thought Kazuo was a more interesting character in the book - by far _the_ most interesting character in the book - but it might have been neccesary to simplify him in this way for the film, so that it could focus on more important dynamics.

I now actually think that BR, more than an enjoyable, higher-than-average quality pop culture artifact, may be an important and defining statement in this day and age. It shows us, for one thing, that stories still have the power to shock and arouse sympathy, even from BR's most likely audience, the very jaded youth who feature in the story. Also, I think it accurately reflects, in a very abstracted and metaphorical way, the plight of a young generation in an uncertain and perilous world. I could be reaching with this, but I will at least say that BR is an amazing overall _product_ which should be examined by anyone with any interest in the humanities.",1096156800,3,3305,4.687931034482759
1442360,5,B00005JL9A,"This movie is absolutely amazing and one that has impressed me none like any other movie in the last few months months.

A schoolclass has been taken hostage and brought to a deserted island where, because they have to pay for the sins of being young, they have to enter a game in which the objective is to kill each other. The one that survives wins and is let off the island.

The tyrant is their old teacher who is just walking around in a training suit not doing a lot but eating cookies. Some of the children start killing immediately, other try to work together. It is very similar to a real computergame. You actually feel the tension of not wanting to die, the fear of death is very well brought onto the screen by the young actors. We are really watching everyone get killed and the score is even being kept on-screen. Girl #3 killed, 30 more to go.

Is it a metaphore of life? just as Lord of the Flies? You sometimes get the feeling it is. Friendships are broken, people start backstabbing etc, even though they are young.

Other similar movies are Series 7 (but not funny at all and not such a spectacle), The Cube was also a movie that came to mind.

The movie is shot shakingly, making it very real. The classical music that is played throughout the movie makes it very eerie. There is a scene with Beethoven for example which is excellent.

I never expected this movie to be this graphic, bloody and very very good. It is definitely one of the best Japanese movies I have ever seen and I will remember it for years to come.",1093910400,,1538,4.341463414634147
1442361,5,B00005JL9A,"For the longest time I had been desparately trying to find a copy of Battle Royale. Finally I just decided to download it off of Kazaa. Let me tell you this is probably one of the most improtant films ever made. If you were to take Lord of the Flies, A Clockwork Orange, Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Running Man, and The Most Dangerous Game of All you would get Battle Royale. the movie really got to me for two reasons: One, seeing all those kids being pinned against one another made me feel like that was me and one of my highschool classes, I don't think I would have the heart to kill the kids that I grew up with. Two, the violence in the movie is portrayed as violence should be: cruel, unforgiving, and irreversible. None of the violence is glorifed of made to look cool. Because violence isn't a glorious thing at all. Thats why I also beieve that that the teenagers of the USA would benifit greatly from seeing this movie. Too many of the movies in America glorify violence, death, and guns. But I am a bit timid about it being released in the US too. I worry that some kid who is immpretionable would get the wrong message and think that killing is cool, lords knows the US has enough trouble with those kind of people. Yet so does Japan and it went over very well over there, so I am optomistic about a US audiance understanding this movie. The very end of the movie when the credits roll really pulled at my insides. The background for the credits is a class photo of Class B. The camera goes over each section of the pic so that you may get a close up of each student. You are reminded that when you see their faces that these are kids. They had lives, families, friends, goals, dreams, and most painful of all students who were in love with them, sadly alot of them never found out until it was too late. In the special version we see flashbacks of their childhoods. We see them struggling against not fitting in, domestic violence, and suicides in the family. And we see that none of these kids are bad kids, they are all alone and crying out for love. That is probably the greatist tragedy of all.",1093564800,4,2122,4.29426433915212
1442362,5,B00005JL9A,"BR had me riveted from the first opening shots of a blood stained smiling girl right up to the end.  Movies like this, for me, only come around once in 5+ years.

While the premise of BR is weak (how in the world does randomly choosing kids to kill each other scare other kids straight?  Choosing messed up kids to kill each other off yes, but randomly?) there is so much of everything else done right that it's very easily overlooked.

There are some cheesy / overdramatic moments in the movie.  However, the concept of the BR and what happens to ordinary teens in this extraordinary situation is done brilliantly.  Ordinarily harmless teen cliques / social annoyances, now become magnified to the point of life and death.  What happens to friends when their choices are kill or be killed?  What happens when the social contract is null and void?

Spoiler Alert!!!! -------------

One of the most dramatic moments include the scene when a student's collar-bomb is triggered by the teacher Kitano.  There is no compassion from his classmates just a mad scramble to keep away.  Even his best friend pushes him away helplessly.  But after that mad scramble we see humanity still there but pushed down helplessly by terrible circumstances.  And my favorite moment: Shogo Kawada and his girlfiend are the only ones left alive with the BR running out of time.  As they try to rest, the collar bombs starts to count down since there are still 2 contestants alive.  They look at each other and hug.  What follows next just blew my mind away as did many of the movie's very memorable moments.

The ""Rules"" of BR are well thought out as is the choices of ""Weapons"" given to the teens.  Not all the kids are armed to the teeth.  Some get useless items or useful items but not as direct weapons.

The music is enjoyable and very memorable but I hated the ending pop song which seemed all wrong and disjointed with the rest of  the film.  I would be surprised if it was chosen by Kinji san as opposed to a marketing vehicle.  BTW i believe it is also used as the theme song for a japanese curry (vermont?).

While I was geniuninely interested in what happened to the students I did not find much of the violence particularly disturbing or emotional.  For that I refer you to any Quentin flick where torture is involved or City of God where Ze meets up with the Shorty gang.  I find violence disturbing when it involves a defenseless victim.  That only happens once or twice in this movie.  It's not so much the violence that is shocking as it is the circumstances surrounding that violence like the collar bomb and Kawada and his girlfirend.  This is certainly no, ""yawn... another person died"" in movies like Van Helsing or unfortunately BR2, the sequel to this film.

However much you may enjoy BR, be warned about BR2 which is a load of crap.  Seriously.

And as a postscript you gotta take some of these 1 stars with a grain of salt because the same people who gave BR 1 star gave Van Helsing (piece of sheet) AND I, Robot 4 stars!!  Actually, I'm kinda glad that is the case.  If the same people who gave those works or crap 4 Stars had given 4 or 5 stars to BR I'd be embarassed.",1092787200,2,3173,4.4877622377622375
1442363,5,B00005JL9A,"This is, hands down, the BEST MOVIE COMING OUT OF JAPAN IN YEARS. As a reviewer who read the book first and loved it, I had high expectations for this movie and it did not let me down. Here's a quick plot summary: the Japanese government is in chaos. The adults are afraid the youth, who are apparently uncontrollable and boycott school. Therefore, the government institutes `Battle Royale', a program designed to rein in the youth. A ninth-grade class is randomly selected each year, sent to a deserted island, supplied with weapons, and forced to kill each other until there is one survivor. I would have thought it difficult for a movie to track all 42 kids. In the book, this is fine since the book is 600+ pages. But this also works very well in the movie since the director somehow gives almost all the characters substantial screen time and v. memorable scenes. He doesn't cut any character short. And even the short scenes have real poignancy. Therefore, we remember almost all the characters, what they did, and how they died.
THE ACTING IS SUPERB. The kids in this movie are played by actors between 15-20 years old. With the exception of one or two, the actors were v. believable and conveyed all the teenage angst, suspicion, hatred, rage, love, goodness, and all the other goodies in the book. And even when they are doing terrible things to each other, they are still sympathetic characters since we understand they are deathly scared and are still young....that unique balance is crucial to the movie's success.  Just to mention a few standouts: ERI ISHIKAWA (Yukie Utsumi) is the best actress, best-looking girl, and my favorite in this entire movie. She's perfect as the class representative who tries to calm everyone down but ends up feeling the same suspicion that is doing her classmates in. Her lighthouse scene is the most memorable scene in the film, and in my opinion, one of the best scenes in the history of cinema; just watch her face...aahhhh, that is perfect acting... TAKESHI ""BEAT"" KITANO (Kitano) is the perfect combination of menace and sympathy as the teacher who sends the kids to their deaths and reads out the names of the dead with phrases like, `Here is your list of goners! Only 3 dead. You're slacking off, I'm disappointed with you!' I love how emotions can flicker on and off his face; at one point, he can be scary and mean and terrible as hell; at other times, we feel sorry for him! TATSUYA FUJIWARA (Shuya Nanahara) and AKI MAEDA (Noriko Nakagawa) are fantastic as the couple we root for. Aki Maeda, especially, looks adorable in the movie and conveys innocence and purity so well. TARO YAMAMOTO (Shogo Kawada) is one of my fave characters in this movie and is the best bad-ass I've seen in movies for a while. He looks simultaneously tough and soft, which gives him an interesting complex. MASANOBU ANDO (Kazuo Kiriyama) and KOU SHIBASAKI (Mitsuko Souma) are deliciously wicked as the class's two crazy/wild ones, the two that are consciously going out to kill their classmates without remorse. And, on a vain note, SOUSUKE TAKAOKA, who plays the sweet and caring Hiroki Sugimura, is a major hottie.
The DIALOGUE in this movie, like the book, is sometimes cringe-worthy (you know, like, `Damn! I survived, thanks to my excellent bulletproof vest!!'). However, because it is usually delivered perfectly and on target, I hardly noticed it. (It may also be because the actors were speaking Japanese and I was only reading subtitles because I can't understand Japanese.) Although I did like the book better than the movie (tells you how good the book was since I think the movie is FANTASTIC), there are some moments in the movie that outshine even the book because of the acting and the way the dialogue is delivered. For example, Yukie's LIGHTHOUSE SCENE is much better in the movie than it is in the book. I love the way their voices become delirious and the way their anger escalates (it's nearly palpable!).
Also, the setting is well-done, too. There are a lot of neutral and cool colors like whites, grays, and cool blues that set the mood and provide a contrast for all the bright red blood. That reminds me: this movie has, like the book, been criticized as VIOLENT EXPLOITATION. That is understandable since the movie shows young classmates killing each other in messy, realistic ways, some willfully and some out of fear. The movie is v. bloody and v. violent and sometimes gratuitous. I normally don't like violence, I don't like blood and guts and gore flying everywhere. I really hate those `Halloween' and `Freddy' and `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' type movies because blood spills needlessly and in an excessive/stupid way. But `Battle Royale' is different. The violence will sometimes make your stomach turn, but you'll think, that's the only way it could have been done.
And lastly, I have to praise the way CLASSICAL MUSIC is used in this movie. It's done in a v. artsy way that makes you think about the horrible things you've seen and make sense out of it, and I loved it. The use of Mozart and Giuseppe Verdi's `DIES IRAE (REQUIEM MASS)' in the opening sequence is especially incredible. It practically lets you know that you're in for a wild, thought-provoking, horrific, unique, and exciting ride. Also, MASAMICHI AMANO (the composer) did a great job on the original music in `Battle Royale.' I've listened to most of the soundtrack and think every one I've listened to has real poignancy and feeling. The way it is used in the film is even better; it brings even more meaning to what the kids are feeling and what they are doing.
This is an INCREDIBLE movie - a mind-blowing exposition of the minds of teenagers and a fantastic exercise of style. I LOVED this movie. After watching it, you will be thinking about it for days; all the scenes of teenage angst will not leave your mind too easily. I give it my highest recommendation...go watch it right now!!",1090195200,5,5921,4.765335929892892
1442364,5,B00005JL9A,"Japan's economy has fallen. Students are boycotting school. Unemployment rate is at 15%. What does the government decide to do? Pass the Battle Royale Act.
Abnormal plot for a movie you're thinking. It is, but still a great movie. The BR(battle royale) act is simple.you gotta kill all your classmates till only one lives.you are given a bag of food , water, and a random weapon. some ppl get lucky and get a gun, and some get a potlid. lol
A random class is chosen for this act each yr. this yrs is just anotehr class. but every character has a simple background that is built as long as they live.

1442365,5,B00005JL9A,"This movie is truly awesome.  It works on every level from social commentary/satire, horror, action, drama, romance, and just pure fun.  This is what people who dismiss subtitled films are really missing out on.  Now that I'm done gushing, I'll give you the review.  The film involves a group of around 40 students in a classroom that has been randomly chosen for the government's BR (Battle Royale....duh!) program.  The children are gassed and placed on a secluded island where they are shown a hilariously satirical (and extremely upbeat) instructional video instructing them that they are to kill each other and the last boy or girl standing gets to go home.  Each student receives a package containing water, map, compass, etc. and a weapon, some useless like a soup pot lid and some lethal, such as a sickle or even a machine gun.  Any resistance explodes a steel collar that has been placed around each student's neck.  Let the carnage begin!  Kill Bill fans will recognize one familiar face in the brilliantly psychotic Chiaki Kuriyama (minus her ball-and-chain).  As the killfest commences, different strategies emerge.  Some students seek and destroy their former comrades while others band together and hide out and some simply do themselves in rather than participate in the blood bath. Some even hatch a plot to hack into the BR computer system and bring the battle to a halt.  Then there's that mysterious ""exchange student"" who showed up in class for the first time on the day of the Battle Royale and seems just a little too thrilled with it all as he mows down everyone he comes across without a word. So much fun! You see each and every death and the movie counts down the students as they die until it's all over.  The battles are very gritty and real; sorry, no kung fu or anime-style sword battles.  This is the most enjoyable foreign film I've seen since Versus, and this is by far the better film.  If you have even heard of this movie you owe it to yourself to own it.  It begs to be watched again and again.  Heck, with such a strong premise, Battle Royale could be a franchise in the making; it could literally be remade a dozen ways and still kick ass.  Anyhow check it out, you won't be dissappointed.",1088035200,3,2229,4.671794871794872

Unlike Series 7, which had nothing more than a concept, Battle Royale is an excellent movie on all fronts - plot, acting, script, cinematography, music-score. My only gripe was that some characters took a LOT of bullets before they finally died, can't help feeling this was a trifle unrealistic.
This movie is well worth buying, you can watch it over and over.
BUT I think the version I got had some scenes cut out! What is the basketball scene that you are all talking about?

1442409,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royale might be perceived as another Kill Bill, a ""Survivor"" mockery where it showcases a bunch of students battling each other to death in style. Well, quite the contrary (despite my misleading title). Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo in Kill Bill) fans will be disappointed here since her role here was akin to being a cameo, although she excelled in her brief part. Not surprisingly after the success of Kill Bill, the name ""Battle Royale"" lingered among die-hard movie fans. Here, Kill Bill fans will realised that it's quite a different movie.
George Orwell speaks of the dangers of totalitarian governments and ""political correctness"" forced to the masses. The movie Equilibrium was such an example and although ""Battle Royale"" may seems like it has no relevence to Orwell's 1984, it still depicts the destruction of a group of people under hands of a regime hell bent on forcing their ""political correctness"". The first deaths already occured even before the commencement of Battle Royale when the character Nobu tried to rebel against Kitano sensei only to have to be blown off by the necklace stuck on his neck. And sensitive, discerning viewers will watch in horror as the students run around the battlefield like mices in lab experiments, killing each other in various de-humanizing ways, often against their whims. To add more surreal feeling to the movie, you should watch how the training video girl explains the rules of Battle Royale with such childish enthusiasm, and the way sensei Kitano announces the casualties of Battle Royale in casual, and at times cheeky manner.
Battle Royale, as I said, is a mockery to ""Survivor"", where we often see reality show contestants lie, cheat, and deceive their way into victory. In this movie, reality show is a minefield where fiddling around could mean instant death. One striking example is the lighthouse scene where a normal meal with comrades becomes a bloodbath because a girl ate a meal that was supposed to poison Nanahara. Distrust and emnity from beginning exploded into a grudge fury, and you don't need to guess what happens next.
Overall, it is one of the best movies I've ever watch, with all-around decent acting by cast, grippling, yet consistent narrative, and a great soundtrack. The use of classical music complimented with occational pop and rock is great, although my only gripe is the use of ""Dies Irae"" from Verdi's Requiem not dramatic enough.
P/S: For fans curious of Battle Royale II (a.k.a Requiem), it isn't the a Battle Royale at all, instead a Japanese Saving Private Ryan (with even an Omaha Beach re-depiction scene!) film where a bunch of students are forced to an island to annilate the terrorist leader Nanahara, a survivor of Battle Royale who waged war against all adults.",1084147200,2,2761,4.991323210412148

1442414,1,B00005JL9A,"Most of the hype surrounding ""Battle royale"" are from viewers who thought that this film's only premise was to be like an ultra-violent and ultra-dumb movie that resembles some of the cheapest video games out there. Sad thing is, this notion is correct.
  I would never object to a film being over the top violent if there is a serious comment it's making while using the violence as an over-emphasis point or as a depiction of a particular reality. A good example would be ""Natural Born Killers"" by Oliver Stone.
  But Battle Royale is simply a ridiculous b-movie trying to front itself as a flick with serious social commentary.
  The attempt-at-a-plot is about a future society where the government seeing youngsters as a threat picks one school class per year and sends it to a remote island where they are condemned to exterminate each other till only one survives. This is supposed to set an example for other rebellious youth who might have the ""wrong ideas"".
  Now this premise had massive potential to turn into a very interesting dystopia commentary, very much in the lines of classic books like ""1984"" or ""Brave new World"". Alas, the scriptwriter of this cheapo-flick was no G.Orwell or A.Huxley.
  What we get instead is first an ultra-thin set-up of the plot. No explanations are given about what we're seeing and no comments about it either. The supposed plot is put together within the first 5 minutes because the director is obviously in a big hurry to get the massacre-thon under way.
  After that, we see a class of 40 students who've been picked, most armed to the teeth, blowing each other's heads off (along with other body parts as well) while uttering lines of enormous stupidity and while muttering dialogues about ""who's in love with whom"" (this you'll hear at least a dozen times from a dozen different characters) while the body-piles around them are increasing.
  There's not one single character in this film that says anything above the IQ of a microwave oven, not one single line worth remembering, not even a hint at anything of any intellectual value.
  It's inevitable of course, that this film has attained its cult status, especially among the generations grown up with mindless video games of the same frequency who will see this film as ""provocative"" only because of its level of violence.
  But even if it was to be taken on that level, that is, even if it was to be judged on sheer shock-value it would still fail.
  The directing is so cheap and the actors so much cheaper, that most of the time it comes across as a parody of something gone unbelievably wrong.
  When i read the storyline of the film in some magazine, i thought i was in for a serious film of independent and underground cinema. What i got was a massive assault on my brain cells. You've been warned.",1082505600,15,2809,4.701431492842536
1442415,5,B00005JL9A,"""Battle Royale"" is a superb film, subtle and sad and over-the-top and loud all at the same time.  The story is often compared to ""Lord of the Flies,"" but that is a bit of a misnomer.  ""Lord of the Flies"" was about reverting to primitivism, whereas ""Battle Royale"" is a futuristic cautionary tale in the tune of ""1984"" and ""Brave New World.""  The caution at work here is the threat of absolute bureaucracy, and the dangers of the loss of the value of life and respect in a rules-dominated society.  This is a threat quite apparent in modern Japan.
The actors in ""Battle Royale"" all deliver excellent performances, including the amazing talent ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano playing the appropriately named ""Kitano.""  The film was not directed by Takeshi however, so it lacks his beautiful visual style.  It does however feature one of his riveting paintings. There is a good range of responses from the various actors playing the students, from outright suicide, to panic, to a drive to win to a drive to help.  Unfortunately, the character of Kazuo Kiriyama (the machine gun boy) is woefully underdeveloped, and instead of the fierce, cold genius of the book he is a somewhat characterless villain.
While a violent film, I wouldn't characterize ""Battle Royale"" as an action film per se.  Anyone looking for a Hong Kong-style action film should realize that Japan and China are quite different countries with different approach to movies..  ""Battle Royale"" retains the quietude and patient pacing that is the hallmark of Japanese cinema, and which leaves some viewers bored, who are used to a quicker pacing.  The bloodshed, while in great quantity, is also more cartoony in nature, which is also more typical of Japanese films, which does not favor a naturalistic approach.
I think some familiarity with problems in modern Japan (ie: school violence, overwhelming bureaucracy) gives some necessary perspective to this controversial movie, and helps frame it as more than exploitation.  It is a political statement, with a subtle message underlying the overt violence.  Along with this, knowledge of Japanese culture deepens the understandings of certain scenes, such as when Kitano performs the prescribed exercises, and the training video shown at the beginning.  Without understanding, these scenes might come off as merely quaint or odd.",1081987200,11,2331,5.118733509234828
1442466,4,B00005JL9A,"Certainly one of the most original and impressive movies of the last years, ""Battle Royale"" presents an intriguing premise and a superb execution. In a near future, the Japanese Government concludes that the downfall of the country is increasing due to the shallowness and free spirit of its youngsters. In order to make kids more motivated and capable, a special unit sends a high-school class to a desert island where the students will have to kill each other until only one survives. If they refuse to do that, they all will be killed within three days.
Yes, this is a far fetched concept, still it works surprinsigly well and manages to be a superb comment on the grim, hopeless and desperate atmosphere that surrounds modern societies. ""Battle Royale"" isn`t an easy movie to watch, since some parts are truly shocking, gut-wrenching and unexpected, yet it`s a strong and memorable cinematic experience, different from most of the disposable and formulaic flicks around. It expertly mixes drama, tension, horror, action, humour and gore, managing to be compelling and consistent throughout.
The character development is good enough, but it`s hard to develop so many characters (around 40) at once. It`s interesting to see how people react when they have to face such an extreme situation, acting under fear and suspition while dealing with their schoolmates. ""Battle Royale"" could easily have turned into a violent and empty sequence of action numbers with cool camera angles, but it wisely avoids that perspective and instead creates a gripping, multi-layered and complex narrative.
This is a superb effort that approaches key subjects like the first steps into adulthood, the conditions of love and friendship, trust and commitment, loneliness and individualism, future choices, totalitary systems and life in general. A gloomy, dark and ambiguous achievement, this Kinji Fukasaku effort delivers a surreal social commentary with some incredibly clever, poignant and creative ideas.

First, don't expect to see martial arts of any kind. These kids are just there to kill each other in any way shape or form other than trying to esape.
The lighthouse scene is disturbingly realstic in terms of what can happen in that situation.
Lots and lots of blood squirting.

1442469,3,B00005JL9A,"I just bought and watched Battle Royale II from a Megacon show.  I have never seen part 1, but I'm pretty intelligent, so I can figure out what it is about.
As I get the gist of what happened in the 1st movie in the start of this one, this was interesting to watch.  However, I am an American, and therefore, like fast-paced movies and books.
And though this movie is rather fast-paced and action packed, it was overdramatically acted by a couple of its actors, making this comical to watch.
The ACTION SEQUENCES SEEM THE SAME.  That's another bad thing about this movie.  They all seemed choreographed pretty much the same.  Needed more different type of weaponry, and an occasional hand-to-hand - which there is none of!
But I liked this movie, just not as much as I wanted to.
It had great potential with its decent cast and overall very good look to it, along with the cool setting.
It dragged at times, when these newer kids go a-hunting for the surviving kids of the 1st Battle Royale.  Cool idea, not so cool execution.  But still better than a lot of Asian movies I've seen.",1079136000,,1082,4.461928934010152
1442470,4,B00005JL9A,"An interesting film. Once I was able to accept the outlandish premise as merely hypothetical (How much more far-fetched can you get?), I became hooked. A very chilling concept, which lends to one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. But whoever compares this film's director to John Woo, simply doesn't know John Woo. Woo is a stylish director, the master of fancy gunplay. Without him, there would be know Matrix, no Max Payne, nor a number of other Woo-inspired monuments to gunplay. (However, if no Matrix would mean no Matrix 2 or 3, then perhaps it would all be a worthy sacrifice.)
This film's director seems to have foregone style (that is if he had the ability, as not all directors are cut out to be action directors), but kept the insane gore for which Japanese cinema is known.
Of course, that might be a good thing. The violence is horrifying; hard to watch at times. Yet, had this film been filled with fast, slick, cool diving and shooting moves, it may have lost what hard-to-find credibility it boasts as it is. And when I say ""hard-to-find,"" that is not to degrade the film's quality. Like I said, I had to accept the premise as purely hypothetical. Not many other viewers will show that same willingness.
Overall, I loved the movie. It's definitely worth the effort of seaking out.

1442473,5,B00005JL9A,"I'll start by saying that my appreciation for japanese cinema is limited.  This is due to my own lack of patience, not acceptence of its intrinisic differences from American cinema.  I like Kurosawa, have seen them all but I wouldn't likely watch them again.  I like anime but wouldn't go out of my way to watch it (although the current Teen Titans cartoon is very anime style and I'm finding that I do like it).  The japanese monster movies were good when I was a kid.  But that's about it for my appreciation of japanese cinema.  If you're a snob about it, well, sorry but it is my review.
I bought Battle Royale on a self-dare...I challenged someone online to find me a movie that I would love that was shocking and relevent.  He told me to get Battle Royale.

  Although the movie satisfied that sick part of me that enjoys violence and death in movies, the plot was rushed and had some holes in it.  The charecters were not developed enough either.  All of which is corrected if you read the novel that the movie is based on.  It is much better (as books always are).  You will actually understand what drives certian characters to their behaviors.

1442475,5,B00005JL9A,"Battle Royal remains unreleased in the West not because of its controversy but because of distribution problems that the production company Toei is mixed up with. There are several other Toei films that have not made it to the West either and this has something do with distribution sharing rights that are still problematic even in their own country. So the reason for the non-appearance of this great movie is not because it has been banned or refused-classification, but because of money and distribution rights.
The film is a violent spin on Lord of the Flies. It is knee-deep in right wing political philosophy that certainly will reverberate in a world still reeling from the effects of terrorist related violence.
Battle Royale is set in the future but seems closer to the present. Because of school truancy and violent assaults on teachers the Japanese government has passed the Battle Royale act which allows them to randomly select classes to be sent off to boot camp where there are given the task of murdering one another in a training island until one of them is left and allowed to go free. Each of the students is given a bag which contains supplies and a ""type"" of weapon. Detonators are attached around their necks should they try to escape or break the rules. There are also hot zones around the island that will automatically cause a head buster if they step into them.
This film is a complete satire on political institutions from start to finish and is certainly very graphic, but is still a lot of fun. The story and characters do develop even among all this last man standing mayhem and there are plenty of twists. In fact this is a memorable and fun film even though a little controversial but I think it is hard to take this film too seriously because it does a lot of comic interludes along way and even the death scenes are played out for laughs - although albeit very violently.
This is a slice of sci-fi classic that does have a few morals to boot. It is a great cinematic experience in a live-action Manga sort of way and if you can stomach the violence you will enjoy it immensely.

this movie doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence, but at the same time it's  also a social commentary regarding violence within today's high schools, (especially in america)and the bad bridge between the generation gap.
beat takashi (brother) does a great portrayal as the sadistic teacher/controller KITARO. BR has influences from previous american flicks like the running man, lord of the flies,escape from new york and fortress (the necklace bomb ""wedlock"")
what's disturbing is watching those cute japanese kids get slaughtered in so many ways(shootings,hackings,slashings,poison etc.) that it almost resembles a virtual videogame.
the ending i felt was anti climatic, but the flashback sequences adds much depth to the characters. too bad most americans will NEVER get to see this DVD Gem because of the contriversial content, but if ever there was a us adaptation like THE RING, director paul verhooven(robocop,starship troopers) would be my first choice and/or maybe quinten tarantino just as long as he doesn't make a cameo appearance like he did in his previous movies.

No, each student is equipped with a duffel bag with some sort of ""weapon"" and a explosive-filled collar set to go off after three days unless the mission is accomplished: the death of all but one of the students.
Petty differences and puppy loves are suddenly amplified into matters of life and death as students either bond together in the hopeless struggle to survive or turn predator and exercise their worst grudges on their former friends and classmates.  The film is a kind of Lord of the Flies taken to logical extremes, and the carnage that ensues is enough to disturb even a hardened action and horror film fan like myself.

1442519,3,B00005JL9A,"This movie is akin to ""Running Man"" or perhaps, a more violent version of virtual reality show, ""Survivors"".  It is taken place in a futuristic Japan, where high rate of unemployment & social imbalance caused a deep distrust of the old towards the young.  Thus, the creation of a BR Act (Battle Royale Act), where a random lottery was held to nominate an unfortunate & unknowing class to fight & kill each other off until there was only one remaining.  Students had no other alternative as they were given a deadline of three days.  If no winner was declared, then, the survivors would be killed off anyway through the mean of an explosive collar that was attached to their necks.  In order to spice up the event, there would be willing participants who were in the game for the sake of killing.  As the movie progressed, we would see students killed one another with weapons allocated.  They were split into their own groups & along the way, we would see suspicion formed, & some would stick with their mates till the very end.  Some knew that they wouldn't live through to the next day and they would reveal their inner feelings towards their opposite sex and some would do the unthinkable by sacrificing their own lives to save the ones that they were in love or infatuated with.  Beat Kitano was the teacher in this movie & he played a very brief role.  Still, he added weight & dark humour to this movie.  All the time, we were reminded of the incredulity of the movie by having classical music that went together with the killing.  Surrealism at its fullest.  In the end, the message of the day would be love and true friendships that saved the day.  Perhaps, I see too much in this movie but I would like to think that the Director tries to convey the dysfunctional Japan that it is gradually becoming or just maybe, he's simply paying homage to the Manga culture of Japan.  The blood in this movie is very much akin to ""Kill Bill"" version, that is in abundance and flourishing like a water fountain.

Okay, it's more violent then your typical film, it's also very entertaining and enlightening.  But more then anything ""Battle Royale"" is a very serious social commentary.  And it really has nothing to do with the fall of respect and order in social structure like some may think.  The most important key in the film is survival and trust.  These students are put in this extreme situation and each person reacts and adjust in a very different manner.  The novel and the film are in fact a social commentary on how our instinct will overcome every emotion when backed into a far enough corner.  Some of the scenes in the movie were just too perfect in depicting such a human trait.  I was really impressed with some of the things that happened in the movie.
Overall the acting is above average, nothing special, but then again good acting.  The direction of the film was great along with the great adaption to script.

1442523,5,B00005JL9A,"One thing to be said about Japanese horror/extreme action is that it could seldom, if ever, be accused of being formulaic.  Some of the most ingenious storylines ever thought of have come from Japanese films(see Ringu, Suicide Club, Kairo, Uzumaki).  But while the ideas are in place the problem is often with the execution of the film.  Overacting, cheap special effects and slow pacing between action scenes have often plagued the Japanese films I have bore witness to.  Not so with Battle Royale.  The concept is pure genius and believe me, the execution even better.
Kitano is a strict teacher whose source of pride comes from being able to instill discipline in the young.  He is for the most part very successful at this and highly respected among his students.  Then one afternoon, an out-of-control student who he reprimands stabs him in the back of the leg.  Following this incident Kitano quits his teaching job and disappears out of sight.  Fast forward to a few years later.  A group of 42 students(who appear to be in their mid-teens) board a bus to go on a class trip.  At some point during the bus ride a sleeping gas is unleashed and all the students fall asleep.  When they wake up, they find themselves cramped in a classroom and with a tight metallic necklace tied around their necks.  To their great surprise, in through the door walks Kitano, who most have had as a 7th grade teacher.  Kitano informs them of a game he has devised called Battle Royale that they have been randomly selected to be a part of.  Battle Royale is Kitano's sadistic vengeful way of getting back to the youths he feels lack discipline and `mock' adults.
The rules behind Battle Royale are this; The students are now on a remote island where all 42 of them will be pitted against each other in a game to the death.  Each student is given a backpack that includes water, food, a weapon, a compass and a map of the island.  The last person standing gets to go home free.  There is a catch however.  They only have 3 days.  If more than one person is left standing after 3 days, their collars will all blow.  The island is also mapped with regions that contain shifting `danger zones', of which Kitano informs them of over a loud speaker.  If someone is still standing in a danger zone after Kitano makes the announcement their collar will explode.
From the moment the rules of Battle Royale are transmitted to the kids, the film's frenetic pace never lets up.  Director Kinji Fukasaku pulls absolutely no punches here, making this a no-holds-barred extreme version of Lord of the Flies that is compulsively watchable.  The acting performances he is able to draw out of these kids is remarkable.  Part of what Fukasaku seems to be trying to achieve with this film is to give us a character study of how different some kids can be from others and how differently they can react when faced with peril.  One group commits suicide instantly, refusing to be a part of the sadistic game they're forced to play.  Another group spends their time shacked up in a cabin, trying to figure out a way to hack through Kitano's system so they can get the collars off their necks.  One group of women simply decide to live as normally as they usually would by cooking, exchanging stories, staying civilized.  And of course, some kids choose to become killing machines, determined to be the one to get out of the game alive.
Director Fukasaku's choice of filming locations is absolutely stunning, from the lush tropical jungles, to the edge of the sea, the lighthouse, etc.  The film's image looks surprisingly sharp and clear for a non-hollywood production.  The only thing I would have to complain about are the English subtitles.  They are filled with grammatical errors and poor sentence structuring.  I also got the impression that many parts of the dialogue were missing or were not presented accurately.  Hopefully, Battle Royale will see a North American DVD reissue that will be dubbed or at least have better subtitles.  I'm not hoping for a North American remake however.  It would probably be a PG-13 `message' film starring the likes of Frankie Muniz and the Olsen twins. Ugh!!
Battle Royale is an action classic not to be missed.  It's adrenaline-fuelled pace will appeal to action fans, it's bloody carnage and gore will appeal to horror fans.  This is a film that puts just about any North American action film to shame. A modern cult classic that deserves a wider distribution.",1069200000,3,4470,4.705276705276705

You are than drugged and dragged to an undisclosed location where you are told that you are now in a fight for survival amongst your class mates. Winner kills all.
This is not a reality any of us expect to wake up to any time soon. This film was made to bring to an extreme light the competitiveness and ignorant structure of the japanese school system. It's a satire of the extreme lengths a government would go to in order to get the youth to fall in line. It's a sign of our troubled times where the young are no longer innocent, and many times they are forced to confront realities that were once years away but now are common place for your average 13 or 14 year old. This is the world of Battle Royale, a symphony of fear and violence. A warning that will never reach the ears that were meant to hear it.
This is not a movie about the joys of violence. It is not an anime style fantasy where young kids have super powers and fearlessly kill others for sport. These kids are thrust into their primitive instincts for survival. Making choices that no one should have to make. Would you kill your best friend if it meant your survival? Every possible reaction is explored, from the lovers who would rather die together than play the game, to the internet geeks who use their intelligence to outwit their oppressors. The Director uses classical music to elevate the violence from a mere childish fascination with blood and gore (ala Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill)to a serious situation where lives are real and death is not glorified.
It is not as violent as it may appear and it is also not as cruel as one may come to believe. This movie will never be seen by mainstream America because instead of confronting our fears we blame our media for our faults and hide from the agony our young are going through. We pretend to be squeky clean but allow movies like Kill Bill to grace our movie screens. Violence is all right as long as it's for fun. Violence that teaches a lesson is outrageous and immoral.

Some become killers very quickly and easily, while others resist succumbing.  This very dark comedy follows the experience of one class and the students who beat the system.
Director Kinji Fukasaku, who was in his seventies when he made the film, juxtaposed the uniquely Japanese cliches of ""pure"" youth and chirpy cuteness with brutal ultraviolence to comment on a society in which the generation gap has reached an  apocalyptic level: this is a world where the older generation's feelings of resentment, shame, and guilt toward the younger results in a hatred and fear of its own children.

Obviously the reason for a delay (when the rest of the world has been happily watching this movie at home for over a year) is because no distributor wants to be used as a scapegoat for the USA's social problems the next time some lunatic opens fire on his classmates.
But this film is not about violent exploitation of young people and it is certainly not about condoning such behavior. It is a film about people in an extreme situation and the lengths to which they will go to survive. Many people try to explain away the message that violence is a part of all people by suggesting the film is a peculiarly Japanese phenomenon. OPEN YOUR EYES!!!!
If and when this film ever gets released in the States you should all check it out. You won't see a more daring film in a while.
And if you think this is edgy material for a U.S. release, then check out the sequel in which the Tokyo Met.

This is probably one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, but that's a given through the premise: 50 high school students must kill each other or die. The thing is, every death in the film is on screen. Fukasaku pulls no punches in this one.
If you've never experienced Japanese cult cinema before, prepare to see things you've never seen before. The strongest thing this movie has going for it intellectually is the psychology between the characters, from the pacifists to the bloodthirsty insane. It's such an interesting concept that the movie would still be excellent without the over-the-top violence.

The story has a group of unruly Japanese schoolchildren sent to a deserted island where they are instructed to kill each other (the survivor being the champion and the only one able to escape the island) or be killed in the Battle Royale scheme, an aim by the government to cut down on teenage violence.  Of course, there's a central irony here as well as a certain degree of satire on extremist measures to an extreme problem and on the generation gap.

The violence is at first shocking, and certainly effective at getting its point across, although rather than setting this up as satire the filmmakers should just admit that this is really an excuse to try and make the audience react more strongly to the heavily stylised violence.  Perhaps it isn't fair to highlight this fact to such an extent, although it is true that is the film's only really big disappointment.  Apart from some bad characterisation of the supporting players where it is never really explained why some people kill and others choose not to, this is a very good movie indeed.

This is much more than a comment on the actions of children under pressure, it's a side-swipe at the growing gap between generations (ironic seeing as the Fukasaku fairly old himself)in modern japan.  Even more than that, it's bloody entertaining too.
The characters are developed just enough to care about but the more important aspects of it is that children are both the problem with the society and the ones who are punished.  The survivor is not lauded as the winner but apparently held-up as a lesson to those who have reactionary thoughts.  I say apparently as none of the current 'players' have ever heard of the lesson as Kitano calls it.  Is this because the whole thing is in fact for the personal enjoyment of the adults who are at the forefront of the teenager's revolution?
In post-Columbine America (and I come from a town which lost a generation of children in similar fashion), those who could watch this film and grasp just some of what the film is trying to say then it has a very positive,and actually uplifting, message.",1032393600,,1121,4.67005076142132
1442635,2,B00005JL9A,"For all the cinematic virtuosity displayed in Battle Royale -- the flawless compositions, the dazzling array of colours -- the film is a hollow, sadistic orgy of violence with paper-thin characters, bad acting from most of the cast, and hardly any semblance of story.
It's easy to see why this film got banned -- I'm not one to support censorship, but Battle Royale's claim towards satirical intent is foiled by director Kinji Fukasaku's unending bloodlust and complete lack of subtlety. Ostensibly, the setup wants to show the tensions between establishment fear and youthful rebellion, to show human beings forced to abandon their humanity -- a powerful concept. But the film projects none of it, because its characters mostly behave like caricatures; screaming, hysterical flesh dolls one minute, dead-eyed psychos the next. Most of the young actors deserve a kick in the behind for their shallow performances, especially leads Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda, whose supposed ""relationship"" is completely unsympathetic by virtue of fake overemoting and a few lines of expository dialogue. In fact, the only two truly interesting characters in this mix are renegade Kawada (played with lazy charm by Taro Yamamoto) and ostracized lonewolf Mitsuko (Kou Shibasaki manages to convey pain through her violent vengefulness). Takeshi Kitano sleepwalks through his thin role, a shadow of the character he usually plays in his own films, with the iron-faced cruelty but none of the charm, humanity, and humour. He deserves better. All the other characters (and actors) are pawns, human puppets for director Fukasaku to slice, dice, shoot, mutliate, explode and humiliate as he sees fit. He delights in the garish reds spraying into the air and characters screaming at top volume in agony, but most of it is gratuitous -- the film doesn't go five minutes without some kind of graphically violent death, and the overall effect is just numbing. You may experience an initial shock at ""Did I really see that?"", but afterwards, it's easy to dismiss the images as just cheap shock tactics, because there isn't sufficient intellectual or emotional complexity to generate identification with the characters and therefore satirical revelations.
I had hoped that Battle Royale would have something new to say about youth behaviour in extreme conditions. But alas, Lord of the Flies (the book and the first film) has already made all of the statements here, and for the exploration of the effects of violence on the human psyche, films such as RoboCop, The Deer Hunter and Kitano's directorial works are far richer, more resonant, and more enjoyable.

1442644,5,B00005JL9A,"To say that the Japanese cinematic tradition is different from
its Western counterpart would be the understatement of the year.
Japanese cinema has never succumbed to the moralistic approach to
moviemaking that permeates Hollywood. To further prove this
point, enter ""Battle Royale"", surely the most controversial film
in years. The story is as follows:
At the dawn of a new millennium, Japanese society is out of hand.
Unemployment rates are at an all-time high; kids are skipping
school and physically assaulting their teachers. This has led to
the government introducing a new measure to keep kids in line -
the Battle Royale Act. Every year, a ninth-grade class is chosen
at random and transported to a deserted island, where they are
equipped with ""Wedlock""-style necklaces that can be made to
explode, a map, a compass, food and water and a weapon. Their
goal is to survive for three days on the island - while killing
off all of their classmates. If, at the end of day three, more
than one person is alive, they are all killed.
The hero of this movie is ninth-grader Shuya Nanahara, who swears
that he will protect the girl he loves, Noriko, and somehow make
sure they both survive. He is unwilling to kill but desperate not
to die, an attitude not shared by all, as we are about to
witness.
As they are equipped with various weapons, ranging from pot lids
to machine guns, we observe how different their attitudes turn
out to be, from Nanahara who is devastated when he thinks he
accidentally killed another boy, to the machine-gun wielding kid
who kills everyone in his path without remorse.
""Battle Royale"" has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's ""A
Clockwork Orange"". I would hesitate making that comparison,
mostly because I'm not a huge fan of Kubrick's. While ""A
Clockwork Orange"" is almost as disturbing in its violence as
""Battle Royale"", the latter is in my opinion the superior film.
The sight of 15-year old kids dressed in school uniforms killing
each other with crossbows, sickles, axes and machine-guns is much
more disturbing than watching a bunch of freaks wearing false
noses assaulting a helpless man. It is hard to put yourself in
the position of Alex and his cronies in ""A Clockwork Orange"",
simply because they are so strange. This is not the case with the
kids in ""Battle Royale"".
The absence of flashy camerawork, slow motion and other cinematic
tricks transforms the camera from a machine to a nihilistic
outside observer. This is a trademark in Japanese cinema, and has
been used in films as varied in style and context as Takeshi
Kitano's ""Violent Cop"" and Norifumi Suzuki's ""Star of David:
Beautiful Girl Hunter"". Not to mention that making a movie like
this in the days of Columbine requires something that virtually
all American film-makers lack: guts. That no American distributor
dared import ""Battle Royale"" just goes to show how conformist the
once individualistic American society really has become.
So is there nothing about this film that could be better? Well,
yes. There are two things I feel should have been different.
First of all the length of the film. At a mere 109 minutes, it is
too short. I would have wanted another thirty minutes or so
explaining the background, to get to know the kids better. We do
get to know them through a few flashbacks, but I would have
wanted more. Had this film started out as a typical American high-
school film like ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""American Pie"" the
violence would have been even more disturbing. Second of all,
it's the violence itself. While I do not feel that violence is in
itself important to a film, it does serve a purpose. My objection
is not that there is too much violence, but that it is not
graphic enough. When I see a kid getting shot I don't just want a
squib going off (a squib is a small plastic bag or rubber balloon
filled with fake blood, which is made to explode to give the
impression of a gunshot wound), I want Dario Argento-style
effects where you follow the bullet through the body, showing the
effects of the gunshot in all their gory details. If that would
be too flashy for this film, why not at least use the great
Japanese tradition of special effects and make a film that makes
your stomach turn?
Nevertheless, ""Battle Royale"" is an experience unlike any other,
and if there was any kind of justice in the world this is the
film that would win the Academy Award for best foreign film. We
all know that it won't. This is a movie that dares question
modern society and what it is doing to people, and that is the
reason why it will never win an Oscar. It is not conformist
enough. That is why I love it.
All I can say is: ""Arigato, Kinji-san.""",1016150400,16,4667,4.671931956257594

The central concept (forcing troublesome teens to fight each other to the death, seemingly as a form of population control) is pretty crazy. I think, more than any on-screen violence, the central conceit is what really makes me nauseous when I watch this film.
There's so many characters in this film, and it seems like they had some trouble giving them developed, individual personalities.

7939063,1,B00005JL9A,Mindless. Just mindless. This could have been an awesome action/gore film. but it was just all way too over the top and overplayed. Never finished watching it.,1511222400,,159,4.925925925925926
7939064,2,B00005JL9A,Got this from a list of great sci-fi movies and I have to say I was sadly disappointed.  It's subtitled and poorly acted.  It's basically a rip-off of The Hunger Games (or visa-versa) so I felt like it was something I'd already seen.,1509667200,,233,4.395348837209302
7939065,4,B00005JL9A,Awesome cult classic. Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is based off of this movie. I can see a lot of the costumes / weapons from this movie in the game.,1508371200,,150,4.592592592592593
7939066,5,B00005JL9A,Its a great movie. I recommend,1508198400,,30,4.166666666666667
