8259678,5,B0015RRNL6,"If you approach this collection for what it is - U.S. government information, documentary, and propaganda films, you will find it fascinating.  Remember the Army ""Big Picture"" television series from the 1960s?  Several of those Saturday morning made for TV information films are here.  How about Hollywood filmmaker John Ford?  Here is his controversial USIA documentary that he produced, ""Vietnam, Vietnam"" from 1971, narrated by a gung-ho Charlton Heston.  This hawkish view of the Vietnam War was withdrawn before it was distributed because the tide of public opinion about the war had changed by the time of its release, so the USIA canned it.  What was the average soldier shown?  How about a very campy and hilarious information film on VD titled ""Where the Girls Are""?  Blood and guts - see the classic ""Battle of Khe Sanh"", or how it was for the average soldier in ""Another Day of War"".  Remember Jack Webb in the  movie ""Drill Sergeant"", well here is the U.S. government version that tells the story of a hard-nosed drill sergeant who instructs, shapes, and molds new recruits and draftees into soldiers preparing to be sent to Vietnam.  All in all, if placed in context of the times, there is much to learn and admire from this varied collection of archival film preserved in the National Archives.",1218844800,25,1308,4.9
