8575710,3,B00BYTVYSI,"This is a highly useful DVD and memento of your trip to Istanbul. I say that because that is one of the most likely places you'll acquire this DVD as it is sold in tourist stores in the Turkish city (most obviously the Hagia Sofia itself).

The DVD is functional - there is narration in eight languages and the English narration is dry but quite understandable. No 'English as second language' issues here. The program lasts for one hour approximately and imparts a heap of knowledge about the various features of the church/mosque turned museum. There is discussion of the frescos and the changes made to the building to turn it into a mosque amongst other things.

All up this is a dry but useful souvenir of your visit to Hagia Sofia and probably useful for educators as well given the variety of languages it has.",1434153600,,817,4.589041095890411
