8314577,4,B001808CWO,"Kotaro is a young boy with a very special power. The power to destroy just about everything, in fact. But there's something wrong with Kotaro: he can't remember who he is! Washed ashore on Papuwa Island - inhabited by strange transvestite animals, strongboy Papuwa and his faithful butler/maid/servant/whipping boy Liquid - Kotaro quickly fits right in. Liquid knows all about Kotaro, and will do everything in his power to prevent the boy from reacquainting himself with his dark past as son of the leader of the Ganma Army. The only problem is,...nearly everyone that shows up on the Island has other plans!

I'll just start out by saying that I am a strange person, and as such am drawn to extremely strange things. Papuwa Island isn't just strange, . . . it's downright weird. However, this is one of my favorite comedic anime of all time next to Excel Saga and Bobobo. Much like those two series, ""Papuwa"" is so odd that it almost defies description. Considering the number of men in this series and the amount of fanservice of said men, I would be so bold as to say it's essentially Bobobo for fangirls. The original manga was created by a woman, so it's hardly surprising. While the animation and soundtrack are nothing to brag about, ADV takes an already outrageously funny concept and makes it even funnier with their dub, which is definitely more suited to the average American palate than the jokes on the original Japanese track. Also like Bobobo, Papuwa is largely a parody of similar shonen series. Chances are if you enjoy Bobobo you will probably love Papuwa, or vise-versa.

Papuwa isn't exactly one of those titles that can be easily recommended due to the nature of the show and the sheer amount of homosexual innuendo, but for those who have been desensitized to the perversity and outrageousness of other anime, sit back and enjoy.",1332979200,2,1852,4.784375
