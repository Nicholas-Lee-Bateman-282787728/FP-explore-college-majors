Digiview Entertainment should not sell such a defective product.  The other packaged film by Saturn Productions is far superior.  This applies to the 'Dragon's Showdown' aka 'The Dragon's Infernal Showdown.'",1364169600,,358,5.339285714285714

Cast: Dragon Lee Cheryl Meng Marty Lam Martin Chui

On of the Bruce lee clones try's to  make a good movie. I mean this dragon Lee character really try's to not only imitate the master but to imitate his presence . However this film is fair It is by no means to be compared to the original master ,because this movie pales in comparison But if your watching kicks and nice action then this is alright. It stars Dragon Lee and Cheryl Meng.

The story is quite intriguing. I'm trying to think of something to say about this movie but it's not much to say. It's a Bruce Lee rip of film so I didn't expect much going into this. Well for the price I paid I guess it was well worth it.

ps i saw this movie a lot",1198800000,,744,4.103448275862069
