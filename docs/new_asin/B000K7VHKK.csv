2684768,4,B000K7VHKK,"...but starting to conform a little too much to modern ""sensibilities"" for this grown up. The older, closer-to-the-original-story episodes are more fun, silly and nonsensical. By comparison, the engines' distinctive personalities are noticeably watered-down from the early episodes, and there is a lot less technical detail. We still love it, though. Beats the pants off Barney any day.",1185494400,5,386,5.672413793103448
2684769,5,B000K7VHKK,"My grand children, boy 3 yrs, girl 1 1/2 yrs, loved this Thomas DVD.  I must have watched it with them 50 times and it was enjoyable every time.",1182816000,3,144,3.9655172413793105
2684770,5,B000K7VHKK,"My little Thomas fan loves any of the Thomas DVD's, no matter how many times he watches them. They are his favorite and I don't think that will change for a very long time. Thomas provides great life lessons like sharing, caring, and friendship. They get a thumbs up from me as well!",1174262400,,283,4.3584905660377355

Just a wonderful Thomas DVD.",1173830400,2,128,4.7727272727272725

2684773,5,B000K7VHKK,"My two year old adores this DVD! Because I'm a teacher, I'm always looking for a way to make his TV time more educational - the special features in this video get my vote! It's nice to have a short break between the stories to make your child think! There's a feature that has children matching shapes, then a maze that matches engines to their special job (ie - Percy to the mail cars). This dvd also has two songs (that will get stuck in your head if you aren't careful). Our edition also came with Duncan (purchased for the same price at Wal-mart). Several of the stories feature Duncan and Toby which was a delight for my son who just adores Toby. You are also introduced to Mighty Mac and Neville. The short stories are engaging and enjoyable for you and your child (OK, maybe not you after the 50th time, but the first few times are great!) Even better, we get out our trains and recreate the story after it's done.

The interface of the DVD is great! You aren't forced to watch ad after ad, but rather you can choose to play once, choose a story, or play constantly. My only complaint is the same with the other Thomas DVDs - why the little case? It's hard for my child to see and choose what he wants. However, it's a small complaint, not even enough to change the star rating.",1171843200,13,1285,4.288065843621399
2684774,4,B000K7VHKK,"The only thing thats wrong with this dvd is that it has no bonus features. The menu is play(once or continuous) and language selection(english/spanish).  You cannot choose stories, songs, or even have a look at the character gallery.",1170806400,5,233,5.131578947368421
