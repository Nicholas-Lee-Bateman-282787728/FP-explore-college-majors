3484329,5,B001B63RNE,"I watched this show as a child and rented a couple of episodes for my children to watch.  They loved it.  Owning the complete series was the number one gift request for Christmas (before an iPod touch even).  Unlike some shows that are watched once and then collect dust, they watch these again and again.  If you like He-Man, you will like these.  ""Thunder Cats, Ho!!!""",1273536000,4,370,4.545454545454546

3484332,5,B001B63RNE,"Awww man who does not love the Thundercats.  Taking you back to the mid eighties, remembering being glued to the television every saturday morning, and later every morning before school for the re-runs.  One of my favorite childhood cartoons.  The discs are well organized 5 episodes I believe to a disc.  The only problem I have with this item is the price, I do not understand why they have to split it uo in two sets for one season, and charge almost 100$ for the set.  No matter The Thundercats are great and I would pay whatever I had to to watch this show again.  It was a lot of fun watching my kids watch it.",1170720000,,616,4.267241379310345
