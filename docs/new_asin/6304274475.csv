7867081,5,6304274475,"This amazing script is built with admirable surgeon's precision. Since a re known mind investigator decides through a sinister experiment to exchange personalities with the distorted mind of an assassin the Demons' Pandora Box will make their ineffable appearing turning all the expectations of our candied doctor.

Magnificent and hallucinating script.",1106956800,2,353,5.921568627450981
7867082,3,6304274475,"A shrink at a mental institution obsesses over the mind of a serial killer. To ""better understand him"", he invents a machine which allows him to trade brains with the madman. Naturally the madman outsmarts  him by assuming his identity and terrorizing his family. This is the  movie's weak point - why wouldn't the killer take advantage of the  situation? The good points are that the direction is quite good and  suspenseful. All the actors do a fine job and the ending isn't as  predictable as I had imagined.",963878400,3,511,4.696629213483146
