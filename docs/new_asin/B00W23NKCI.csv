8711873,5,B00W23NKCI,I'm originally from Henderson just a mere twenty minutes south-east of Las Vegas. I now live in Chicago from time to time I get homesick. I'm an avid bicyclist and this video really made me feel like I was home. I will often play this video when I'm riding my stationary bicycle during the winter months. All the footage was real no CGI. I also liked how they would stop on focus on specific spots from time to time. I was really pleased with the video and would by from bike-o-vision again. The only thing I wish they would have done differently was also shown the strip at night.,1496707200,,581,4.339449541284404

It makes the time pass much faster and not near as tired when I'm finished.",1482624000,,149,4.0
