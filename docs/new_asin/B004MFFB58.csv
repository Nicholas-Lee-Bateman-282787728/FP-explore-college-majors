8436016,5,B004MFFB58,"Peter Lawford has the role of the playboy thief, who accidentally ends up making himself a murder suspect
when all he did was still a jewel. Amazing black and white movie with great action, suspense, and excellent
hold together plot. Slight, ironic twist to the end. He seems like a version of Sherlock Holmes, quick thinking,
analytical. Excellent view for old movie watchers.
Excellent DVD.",1408060800,,392,5.046153846153846
8436017,5,B004MFFB58,"My husband and I saw this film on Friday, June 13, when the classic movie channel featured movies with ""13"" In the titles. We never had heard of this one before, but we were drawn into the charming story. The setting is 1890 London, right after the Jack-the-Ripper murders. This time, a serial killer is targeting London bobbies, and all London is terrified because the trusted constables themselves are not safe. Sir Michael Hordern is the head of the ever-baffled Scotland Yard, and Dawn Addams is his daughter, about to announce her engagement to a British army officer. Peter Lawford is an eligible bachelor/socialite jewel thief who attends London parties where he -- of course -- steals jewels. Lawford's character provides just the right mix of romance and comedy to outweigh the grim realities of the murder mystery. Although filmed in black and white, the movie shows the breath-taking beauty of the Victorian London streets, luxuriously decorated homes, and period costumes. Lawford's character is redeemed when he clears himself and the soldier of suspicion and helps Scotland Yard catch the real killer.",1402963200,2,1115,5.131868131868132
