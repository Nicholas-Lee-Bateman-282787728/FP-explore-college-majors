3096059,5,B0012RLXAG,"The DVD, Country Remedy, is an excellent family movie.  It is really a ""feel good"" movie.  I would especially recommend this movie for those in Western North Carolina.",1209427200,6,167,4.928571428571429
3096060,1,B0012RLXAG,it is barely worth the one star; not by any standard a good movie; you feel like you want to ask for a refund of your hour and a half at the end of the movie.,1519516800,,158,3.4166666666666665

3096063,5,B0012RLXAG,"This was a great movie!!! It was not a true story... just a heartfelt movie full of what life throws at us... for those knocking the medical procedures, well nothing to say much to you all but that it is fake..its a movie!!!! Not supposed to teach you medical practices... Good Grief!!",1517875200,,285,4.5
3096064,2,B0012RLXAG,"The plot/story had potential but it was totally ruined by a stereotyping of a rural town...
.Contrived and silly portrayal of a rural town and it's people....
I watched for 30 minutes and turned it off!",1517529600,,202,4.638888888888889
3096065,5,B0012RLXAG,Very cute movie with an unexpected twist at the end.,1517097600,,52,4.3
3096066,2,B0012RLXAG,"My grandfather was a country doctor, and he indeed worked for chicken eggs and all sorts of other items on barter. Of course, this was 1930s rural America, not modern-day America. Most people nowadays, even in the country, use cash.  Incredibly, country folks know the difference between a doctor and a dentist, whether or not they can afford to visit one. Why, they even have computers and everything!

There was so much stereotyping, it wasn't funny. No, I take that back. It was funny.  It was as if the writer pulled characters out of 1960s comedies like The Andy Griffith Show, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres and stuck them in a modern drama. Otis was there -- no kidding!  If you like the idea of the plot -- city slicker doctor meets rural small town -- watch Doc Hollywood. It's a comedy that's actually light-hearted, funny, and well-acted. Or if you don't mind subtitles, watch La Grande Sduction (2003-not the new one). Again, it's a comedy.  This plot line is better as a comedy than as a drama.

The best thing I can say about Country Remedy is that it was free, because it was on Prime.  The actresses who played the mayor and her daughter were charming, so points for that.  The scenery was nice.  Clearly, many people enjoyed it immensely. I'm just not one of them ... but I have a lot of respect for rural America.",1516492800,2,1336,4.556485355648536

3096069,2,B0012RLXAG,"Plot stretches credulity but ends on a happy note, though I found it all a pill too big to swallow. Not light hearted as trailer & description suggests. Typical Grade B Hallmark-ish movie, so if that's what you're expecting you won't be disappointed",1516320000,,249,4.813953488372093
3096070,3,B0012RLXAG,"I liked the story and message in the movie; however, I feel like it was far from a comedy.  Sure, there were smiling moments in it, but not enough to warrant a classification of comedy.  When one wants a comedy, they usually want to laugh and be entertained.  This movie didn't provide much in the way of laughter; more heartache and tears.  I'll still give it a good review as I did enjoy watching it.",1516147200,,402,4.32
3096071,5,B0012RLXAG,"Wonderful family type movie. We prefer movies with some substance, such as values, principles, morals, consideration, and thoughfulness. Not big on violent killing movies. If you like family type movies, this is worth the watch.",1515888000,,228,5.542857142857143

3096080,4,B0012RLXAG,"A tad predictable, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Here and there on the closeups the camera was out of focus, which makes me think it was not a professional film, but worth watching. Don't expect anything new, but it leaves you with a good feeling at the end, which is the whole point!",1511049600,,285,4.39622641509434
3096081,5,B0012RLXAG,"I thought the story line was good. i thought that all of the actors/acting weree very good.  I like a movie where the actors are believable.  I don't like movies which have plastic people.  Even though the doctor was sort of Hollywood good looking, it fit his character.  I have met a lot of Type A doctors so his looks fit the role. The personalities were believable.  I don't need sex or violence.  It was just right.",1510790400,,419,4.376623376623376
3096082,5,B0012RLXAG,"Very good movie, touching and heartwarming",1510704000,,42,6.166666666666667
3096083,1,B0012RLXAG,"Weak. No chemistry between the actors, especially the father and son.  Soundtrack was generic.  Seemed like a less than mediocre Lifetime movie.  Had a made for television quality, screenwriter factory feel.  Filler product with no uniqueness.",1509148800,,243,5.666666666666667
3096084,3,B0012RLXAG,"I give it 3 stars, and that's generous.  Extra points for no foul language, nudity, and violence, and even though it was cliche enough, it wasn't hard to sit through. BUT... it once again shows us how Hollywood writers believe that ""folks"" from North Carolina are dumb as rocks. First and foremost, most small towns would have a doctor IN TOWN because that's where he'd be needed most (or she). Second, the building itself - c'mon - even in the poorest of towns, you wouldn't have a freakin SHACK for a medical clinic. You may have a trailer, but at least you wouldn't literally see daylight through the wall boards. Lastly, and I skip over a hundred idiotic assumptions made by those glamorous folk in H-wood.... North Carolina has the Kate B. Reynolds Trust and the Duke Endowment. While we have medically underserved areas, those two trusts cover the entire state and would easily have granted funding to a town to have a building that could at very minimum afford a BP cuff, not to mention a better suited shack. One day, these imbeciles in movies will climb down off their castle and actually take a good look at the country without judgmental eyeballs. The movie was filmed in Brevard, NC, and even in dem dar hills, we gots us some medikul fasilitees.",1507852800,5,1258,4.641255605381166

3096089,1,B0012RLXAG,What unmitigated crap...derivative and poorly acted.,1505520000,,52,7.833333333333333
3096090,5,B0012RLXAG,"I loved this movie. I had actually seen it before, but was just as good the second time. It may or may not show extremes between city folk and country or small town folk. I personally think that is made small towns look good. They may have been weary of strangers at first, but when you become part of their town family, they will do just about anything for each other. Cities can be so impersonal. This is a great story of love, loss, and healing.",1505347200,,448,4.22093023255814

3096092,1,B0012RLXAG,This was a horrible movie.  It unrealistically made people from the mountains look like idiots.  Not worth watching.,1505001600,,116,5.388888888888889

3096094,2,B0012RLXAG,"What a cruel joke to make people who live in the mountains look so bad compared to the rich uptight city folk. Not even close to accurate and I live in Idaho. Supporting the medical industry is also a joke. Can't believe this movie was made.

The kids did good acting though, I really like their characters.",1504137600,2,307,4.385964912280702
3096095,4,B0012RLXAG,I really liked the movie but not much of a comedy.  This movie is really sad though it was a good story and had sort of a happy ending!,1503273600,,135,3.6551724137931036

3096102,1,B0012RLXAG,"Sappy, totally predicable, same song different verse. MANY MANY errors... the most glaring of which is a man leaving his city born & bred 10 year old son alone in a house in the middle of the woods in a community where they know no one with absolutely no one with him, checking on him, etc. Why didn't Father of the Year go out & look for his son rather than wait like a bump on a log? When he finally got it in gear why did he not take asthma relief supplies with him while looking for the child? Why didn't he take any medical supplies with him when he was ""kidnapped"" for the house call? And what rural country folks would not have immediately looked for a tick? I shan't go on.
Any idiot could create a more believable plot. Why did I go to the end? Recovering from an injury & couldn't get the the remote! Blessedly it does end.",1500163200,,833,4.116564417177914

3096104,5,B0012RLXAG,"This was a pleasant surprise. I had not previously heard of the movie, but while scrolling through titles, trying to find something to watch, I came across this gem. The story line flowed effortlessly, and the presentation of the characters made you feel as if you had grown up with  them. I've already recommended this movie as a must-see for family movie night. It was nice to see that it is suitable for all ages, and has that one-of-a-kind southern charm.",1499212800,,459,4.666666666666667
3096105,3,B0012RLXAG,"This is a feelgood movie with likeable characters, full of warmth and a great message. But it does move slowly and have amateurish production values. There's a lot of movies out there like this, and if you've been patient with similar feelgood movies, there's no reason you won't like this one as well. It's not really a faith based movie, but shows the power of kindness and community. Edie McClurg lends her charm to the film, always fun to watch. Bellamy Young seems like an odd choice to be in such a conservative movie, but she shines with charm and evens out the woodenness of the other actors. They couldn't help but have to display her cleavage blatantly, but otherwise it's fully kid friendly.",1499212800,,702,4.669354838709677

3096108,5,B0012RLXAG,"Okay, this movie will go on my favorite list.  I was a military dependent growing up and lived on many posts, but I had a few chances where I was able to live in the country and this movie has the country feel all over it.  It has what is great about growing up in a community where everyone knows who you are.  I loved looking at it from an urbanites point of view, how scary some things might seem at first.  I cried several times, but it was good cries.  This movie feels really wholesome, but also has depth and is interesting.",1498953600,2,531,4.116504854368932
3096109,5,B0012RLXAG,"This is a solid movie.  I prefer movies where the actors behave like actual people that I might meet.  Yes, the story is predictable, all movies are pretty predictable if they're modeled after real life instead of shoot 'em up bang-bangs or where the people are hiding dark secrets.  Most people aren't like that.  Good acting and beautiful scenery.",1498521600,2,349,4.864406779661017

3096113,2,B0012RLXAG,"This film has you thinking everyone in the country is a backward redneck who thinks of medicine as voodoo. It was so far removed from reality it was hard to watch. The doctor is so pompous he is hard to take, and the people act like medicine is witchcraft until they need it. I feel like this is some city persons take on what country people must be like. From letting their pregnant girlfriends walk miles carrying heavy boxes to the clinic being covered in racoon poop. I was done with this about half way through, then just tuned it out in the background while cleaning house. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even though its free to watch on prime.",1496188800,,654,4.413223140495868

For the first half hour I was afraid of being subjected to two hours of a Doc Hollywood remake, along with all the hillbilly vs city slicker cliches. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie lose all the over the top acting and found myself immersed in what gradually a real town, complete with roughnecks, rednecks, the town drunk and slut, the pregnant girl with the no good boyfriend and all of them had a good side.

My only real complaint is the three times I watched this someone was cutting onions.  A bit of a tearjerker but not maudlin.  You walk away from this movie feeling like a better person and that is a good thing.  The cast also includes one of my favorite character actors, Mickey Jones.  I appreciated seeing him in this production.

The down side.  The over the top use of stereotype Southern characters at the beginning of the movie was irksome.  I would have stopped watching it the early on the first time I watched it if the lead characters had not been so engaging.  Fortunantly you finally get to see the person and not the stereotype poor country folk fairly quickly into the movie.  The ending, which I won't reveal, shows the supporting characters as the decent, friendly, supportive and caring people that more closely resemble the people I know in the rural South.  The climax was kind of 'eh' but given the movie it fit perfectly.  Get some popcorn, someone you love, hope for a rainy day and sit back and enjoy.",1490400000,4,1149,4.573529411764706

3096148,3,B0012RLXAG,"So much more could have been done to lift this movie up.  It was a comedy wanting to be a tragedy and a tragedy wanting to be a comedy.  It had a decent plot, yet the script was uncommitted which left the purpose of making the movie still in question. Not nearly as entertaining as Doc Hollywood or any of the other relocated doctor from city to country themes.

This one needs a rework.  Everyone can do better and this time don't make the viewer work so hard to stay committed to watching the whole movie.",1486339200,,507,4.25

3096325,4,B0012RLXAG,I've watched it a few times. It is a bit like Doc Hollywood but cleaner and the other doctor movie with the Christian actress from full house where she got time for speeding tickets in a little town to be their doctor to work off tickets. Back to this movie. It so clean. A super excellent choice for family night. I remember thinking this is going to be boring but I gave it a little time. It was excellent. So worth watching this little gem. Just the right remedy for a depressing night. Enjoy.,1479859200,,496,4.287234042553192

3096343,3,B0012RLXAG,Compared to general movie fare the favorables are that it is a comfortable family movie with decent acting.  The plot is rather predictable and so are the characters giving one the feeling that the story was something seen in the past but not exactly.  The dialogue gets a little uncomfortable and irregular and the portrayal of the doctor just doesn't fit the temperament of pediatricians I have known.  Maybe there are small towns where people behave this way but I am not familiar with those.  And the criteria for choosing a department head doesn't fit here either.  Nevertheless it's one of those films that leave one with a relaxed feeling and doesn't evoke nightmares.,1478390400,,675,4.885964912280702

3096520,5,B0012RLXAG,"I enjoyed the movie. Admittedly I cried several times. It might be predictable to most people but I still appreciated the movie. If you like movies with the happy ending that are like Hallmark movies then you'll likely enjoy this one.

I'm from Chicago and have traveled to and through many states. With the exception of NY every state I have been in has a town like the one portrayed in this movie. I live about an hour from San Francisco and within 15 minutes from here there are a lot of towns like the one in this movie. I say all this because it felt unfair seeing all those negative reviews about the movie. I know from my own experience that being low income or very low income can make a doctors visit not feel worth it. When you're uneducated you don't know if the doctor is being genuine with your diagnosis. It can just as easily be said that the medical industry will say you need this treatment or lab work and other tests just to make more money. I went to the ER with no insurance and was billed $36,000 for the few hours I was there even though all I was given was an antibiotic, fluids, EKG test and chest x-ray.

Sorry for anyone who thought my review was a waste of space. I just thought the accurate portrayal of how it can be difficult in small towns in the middle of nowhere needed to be stated as still a current issue. I'm sure a lot of places have boomed over the last two decades but many are also suffering more now than before.",1472774400,55,1455,4.23021582733813

3096554,1,B0012RLXAG,"In order to stay in the running for being named the head of pediatrics at a big city hospital, a doctor is required to go to small-town North Carolina to help get a clinic up and running. The clinic is a falling-down shack with no equipment. The medical scenarios are so far from correct that it's laughable. The story line of arrogant city doctor who has his heart melted by the residents of this small town, with of course, a love interest involved, is fairly standard, but the events leading up to the transition seem very forced.

3096618,2,B0012RLXAG,"The calculated schmaltz in the movie, especially toward the end, tempted me to give this movie 3 stars. Yea, I almost fell for it. But I resisted. The portrayal of members of an Appalachian community as mostly uneducated, stupid yahoos hit all the stereotypes on the subject. But stupidity did not stop there. It especially marked the protagonist doctor, who would leave his 10-year old asthmatic son unattended except by other preteens; who would attempt in his opening speech to the rural community a joke about ""two hillbillies and a rooster;"" who, 3 months after his wife's death, would take his grieving son to a totally new place with no friends or relatives to sustain him in order to promote his career. Ultimately, this stupidity is traceable to the scriptwriters and the movie's director. And that's why 2 stars is plenty.",1471219200,,832,4.907801418439717

There was the obligatory ""let's have a dance"" scene and a few moments of life or death drama along the way.

3097034,3,B0012RLXAG,"Predictable plotline.  Everything happens just as one expects.  Pleasant enough. Several really stupid premises are best ignored if you want to watch it though.  1)  A newly-widowed father thinks it reasonable to move his 10-year-old grieving son to a strange, unfamiliar location where he knows no one...and abandons him in an isolated and silent house all day while he goes to work?  He make no arrangements for his care other than to half-heartedly ask the mayor after he arrives, who sends her kid over? Pays no attention to what he does or where he might go? Say what?  2)  The doctor arrives to run this clinic and finds a ramshackle building covered in dust and animal feces.  They knew he was coming, what gives?  And the mayor calls him bureaucratic because he has the audacity to request medical equipment? Does she expect him to poke his patients with a stick to help them? Well he is later seen using medical equipment so he must have brought his own I guess. 3) These country folks hate doctors?  Like...why?  Maybe because the ones the mayor has exposed them to earlier weren't allowed to use medical equipment so they did just poke them with sticks.",1457395200,8,1164,4.712871287128713

""All these people need is someone to sit across the table from them and listen."" Right. Not even a blood pressure cuff? What happened when the last itinerant doctor left? Did they throw everything away. And, trust me, I know from experience that small-town Southerners are not friendly and welcoming. Not hardly. If you ain't born there, they don't care to know you.

Still... a great movie to sit back and enjoy, particularly if you have any knowledge or background about the ""southern way"".  Yes, it has stereotypes but what's a movie without them? The movie knocked me off balance in that I expected more of a ""romance"" and it was not put forward on the screen but implied.

As with any feel good movie there is a lot of predictability but the story line weaved some nice subplots in and made you want to watch.

Sort of wish they could turn this into a TV show. Mostly for the fantastic scenery but also because it was pleasant to watch.

A very uplifting story that shows what is really important in life.  Kids that are able to play outside and not glued to electronic devices.  Neighbors that help one another where community is more important than money and status.  This town is like a modern day Mayberry!  The story was wonderful watching the doctor learn to interact with the folks in town as they learned to accept him.  The medical procedure that was depicted was a little far fetched, but it made for a good story if you use your imagination a little bit. Overall this was a great family film or great wholesome clean entertainment for adults as well.",1450656000,2,752,4.567164179104478
3097230,5,B0012RLXAG,"I liked it.  As female lead said, ""...Simple pleasures..."" which is the moral about a recently widowed city  pediatrician who is sent with his asthmatic son to NC near Asheville to help community without doctor for ten years.  About how they adapt and choices.  There is the loss of life along with birth, neglectfulness, awnriness, and then awareness and community.  Nate, the son, is bullied and lonely.  The mayor's daughter befriends him and suggests he wish hard for what to happen to the bullies and just wait.  Nate winds up dealing with the consequences of his wish.  The mayor's daughter alone is a firecracker and worth watching.  Everyone is.  Excellent family film.  The nitpick would be that the town gave him a dirty building with a broken step, no equipment, and no money, and he did not bring any equipment of his own.  This seemed very unrealistic that there wasn't a mobile medical vehicle available from the hospital that had requested he go there or the local fire department in a nearby town.  It seems like funds could be drummed up from somewhere from Ashville and the neighboring communities or clubs.  But I was in the mood to overlook that after awhile and enjoyed this movie anyway.",1449792000,,1209,4.777777777777778

One should NEVER shove an epinephrine shot into the left-side chest - this will cause a pneumothorax (puncture of the lung). Not to mention, there are other delicate organ structures in this area - should be thrust into the lateral thigh. Secondly, a tick bite looks nothing like the one in the movie - it is pale in the center (not black) and red around the sides - referred to as a bull's eye rash. Lastly, about the best medical advice I heard in the movie was not by the doctor himself but his drunken assistant who said, ""If it hurts, then don't do it!""",1446076800,,680,4.362204724409449

3097387,5,B0012RLXAG,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The story was more realistic, more reflective of real life, than many of the movies that are available today.

I was somewhat upset by the role of the young boy, son of the doctor, after they moved to North Carolina.  He had a serious medical condition, and realistically should not have been left on his own for so much of the time after the move to the small town.  Even smart, responsible children are likely to need quick, effective care for such breathing problems.

The actors and the story are very good, and the production,  but I would suggest more attention should have been given to the situation of that young boy being simply left alone for entire days after the move to a new home.",1442448000,2,725,4.4961832061068705

We watched on a night to stay in (115 degrees in Las Vegas August heat), when our jobs are getting hard to take and we were feeling a little down.  It worked!  No Academy Award performances, just fun performances and a feel-good story.  Based on a book, they don't have time to develop all the characters, but you will get the meat of it.  Best line of the movie was from the mayor's little girl:  an extended ""Whhhaaaattttt?"" with her little face kind of scrunched up and hands up.  Hilarious.",1441238400,,527,4.427083333333333

Talk about typical misconceptions fostered by people who have no idea what the reality of living in the modern era is for everyone, rural as well as urban.
In reality, those North Carolina, Appalachian residents would have been glad to have a clinic close by rather than having to commute all the way to Asheville for their medical needs. The cabin that was supposedly the clinic? Give me a break! That was somebody's tool shed! More ridiculous stereotype.

If so, then Country Remedy was indeed a 5-star film, since here I am several days removed from seeing it and there are questions I just cannot get out of my head: 1) Why do they insist on referring to what is obviously a pocket watch as a compass? 2) Were the writers and directors actually aware that the film as a whole is guilty of exactly the same condescension toward rural life that Dr. Gibbs demonstrates at the town hall meeting?  3) Has anyone told the folks at AA how watching a baby being born instantly cures alcoholism?

All kidding aside, the film features an interesting cast and is competently acted, but the writers didn't give them much to work with. It's just cliche after cliche. The scenes with the basement stairs kind of made me wonder whether whether this couldn't be re-edited as a horror movie... ""The Remedy.""

3097871,2,B0012RLXAG,"*SPOILER ALERT*
We all with children know how hard it can be to find a decent happy feel good movie for family movie nights. Came across this movie, thought based on the vague description that it was going to be about a father and son taking a trip and the father realizing he had been working too much and that he needed to make more time for his son, they come back home with a new understanding of each other and a stronger bond Yada yada yada.....the movie starts out with this young boy dressed for his mothers funeral. They do go on a trip together where the father leaves the boy alone in the house (a run down cabin on a mountain) they are staying at while he goes to work and it shows the son hearing all the weird sounds a strange house can make and it shows him being scared. I think in the movie, the boy is 10 years old. It also shows him making a wish for something to happen to a bully and then later the bully is having to be rushed to hospital and is near death. It then shows a lady going in to labor but something is wrong and has blood all down front of her dress. The baby is born, all is well. The boy whose father leaves him alone, makes friends. It shows that the boy has asthma. It shows the boy taking off into the woods without his inhaler, stopping reaching for his inhaler while getting ready to start gasping for air, the scene immediately changes to the newborn baby's father putting his hand on the baby and the baby not moving and him telling the mother something was wrong that the baby wasn't moving. That's when we turned it off quickly!
I just don't get why when you find a movie that doesn't have all the bad language, violent and/or sexual stuff in it, you get movies that mess with a child's emotions in such a negative way. Maybe this movie got a little more positive toward the end but based on all we saw just in the beginning, we wasn't going to watch to find out.",1426636800,2,1908,4.15945945945946

3098230,4,B0012RLXAG,"Country Remedy (a.k.a. Simple Things) generates this Hallmark Channel vibe, and that's not a bad thing. Country Remedy is an indie family drama with many flashes of humor. In a way, it's a more sober take on Michael J. Fox's similarly-veined comedy, Doc Hollywood. They're both essentially about an ambitious big city doctor who somehow end up in a small hick town he can't wait to get out of.

Dr. Evan Gibbs (Cameron Bancroft) is a three-months-widowed doctor from Chicago. He's now raising his 10-year-old son Nate (Aidan Mitchell) on his own, and he wants to do right by the kid. But his paternal instincts are warring with his career ambitions. At his hospital he's jonesing for that promotion to head of the Pediatrician Department. As a stepping stone to securing that post, his boss tasks Gibbs with spending the summer at the remote mountain town of Dunn's Rock, North Carolina and opening a clinic there.

In Dunn's Rock Dr. Gibbs is aghast at the rickety shack masquerading as his clinic (and that's even before he finds out about the rats). He's not off at the best start as he gets on the wrong footing with the pretty town mayor (Bellamy Young) whom he initially assumes (and scolds) as his nurse. Yeah, son, Dr. Gibbs embodies the worst of the big city doctor stereotypes. He is callous and condescending and pompous and oh so awkward in his interactions with the hardy locals. That town hall meeting made me cringe. When he bemoans the lack of his office's medical equipment, the mayor pretty much tells him to improvise and make do, her own tactful version of shut-up juice.

Predictably, it's tough times for the doc. Dunn's Rock is slow to warm to newcomers and generally untrusting of physicians. It's deep into the film before Dr. Gibbs gains enough trust within the obstinate community that he's able to build up a clientele. And it's a colorful community to draw from: from the routinely inebriated handyman (Mickey Jones) and the fiercely self-sufficient pregnant hillbilly woman (Amber Benson, from BtVS) and the shiftless father of her child to the mayor herself and her tomboy daughter (Channing Nichols) and her taciturn pal (Zac Gardner).

It's a story that you've seen before and time and again. But the key moments come off well, with Bellamy Young simply wonderful (and naturally gorgeous) as the insightful mayor. Familiar themes are addressed, that of coming to terms with loss and reconnecting and acclimating to strange environments and easing up and taking it all in. Somewhen, Dr. Gibbs gets over himself and settles into the leisurely rhythms of Dunn's Rock. And are you so surprised that the movie title refers not to what Dr. Gibbs doles out to his patients but to healing that's applied to the good doctor himself? He's got a savvy boss back there in Chicago.

One thing. Dr. Gibbs' icebreaker at the town hall meeting: ""Have you heard the one about the two rednecks and the rooster?"" I wish that stone-cold crowd ahad let Dr. Gibbs finish that joke.

Another thing: Did the movie set up Dr. Gibbs' son as asthmatic before that climactic scene? Because, to me, it seemed to come out of nowhere. Maybe they established that when I went to raid the fridge (shout out to tuna melt sandwich!).",1412035200,18,3231,4.802158273381295

IF you continue to watch it in hopes that it will ''pick up'' or have a ''twist'' then I would advise you to check your pulse at regular intervals to make sure you are still alive because I assure you, it will not ''pick up'' and does not EVER have a ''twist'' such as stated in the description and / or other reviews i read. Just so you know, I was not in search of an exciting movie this evening but it would have been nice if it were in the least bit emotionally or intellectually stimulating...like, just a little that would have been great.

And since we are now on the topic of the other reviews now. I noticed this movie was rated almost 5 stars which is rare for any movie. So let it be known that all of the reviews were either written by folks from that little town that this movie was filmed in, by people who made the movie, or by people who are on life support in a nursing home. No normal person in their right mind would like this movie, no matter what you are in to.

This movie starts off, picks up and ends with depressed people moving around from scene to scene at the speed of death, mixed in with the occasional intoxicated half mentally handicapped Carolina mountain person.

QUICK SYNOPSIS

The big city doctor is going through one mental crisis while his ten-year-old son is going through his own mental challenges, both dealing with the death of their wife and mother.

Meanwhile, the doctor has been given a deal, spend the summer in a small town in the mountains area of North Carolina and he'll get a big promotion at work. Most people know that by the end of the movie, he will stay where he is needed, but there are plenty of surprises along the way.

It's the surprises that make this a wonderful movie. It's a big change of lifestyle to move from Chicago to ultra-rural North Carolina, and the citizenry have to take their time deciding to trust the new-fangled city-slicker of a doctor, while some of the kids of the area have to decide whether to like or hate his son.

Do get this movie. You'll love it. Or watch it with free downloading on Amazon Prime, like I did. You'll be glad you did.",1408579200,,1111,4.29665071770335

But he neglects his 11 year old son, in a clumsy attempt to give him privacy and independence.  The child also feels the loss of his mother and becomes acutely aware of the painful distance between father and son, and tries to run away and nearly dies.  This breaks the ice in Daddy's heart.

3330563,2,B0012RLXAG,"My grandfather was a country doctor, and he indeed worked for chicken eggs and all sorts of other items on barter. Of course, this was 1930s rural America, not modern-day America. Most people nowadays, even in the country, use cash.  Incredibly, country folks know the difference between a doctor and a dentist, whether or not they can afford to visit one. Why, they even have computers and everything!

There was so much stereotyping, it wasn't funny. No, I take that back. It was funny.  It was as if the writer pulled characters out of 1960s comedies like The Andy Griffith Show, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres and stuck them in a modern drama. Otis was there -- no kidding!  If you like the idea of the plot -- city slicker doctor meets rural small town -- watch Doc Hollywood. It's a comedy that's actually light-hearted, funny, and well-acted. Or if you don't mind subtitles, watch La Grande Sduction (2003-not the new one). Again, it's a comedy.  This plot line is better as a comedy than as a drama.

The best thing I can say about Country Remedy is that it was free, because it was on Prime.  The actresses who played the mayor and her daughter were charming, so points for that.  The scenery was nice.  Clearly, many people enjoyed it immensely. I'm just not one of them ... but I have a lot of respect for rural America.",1516492800,2,1336,4.556485355648536

BUT... it once again shows us how Hollywood writers believe that ""folks"" from North Carolina are dumb as rocks. First and foremost, most small towns would have a doctor IN TOWN because that's where he'd be needed most (or she). Second, the building itself - c'mon - even in the poorest of towns, you wouldn't have a freakin SHACK for a medical clinic. You may have a trailer, but at least you wouldn't literally see daylight through the wall boards. Lastly, and I skip over a hundred idiotic assumptions made by those glamorous folk in H-wood.... North Carolina has the Kate B. Reynolds Trust and the Duke Endowment. While we have medically underserved areas, those two trusts cover the entire state and would easily have granted funding to a town to have a building that could at very minimum afford a BP cuff, not to mention a better suited shack. One day, these imbeciles in movies will climb down off their castle and actually take a good look at the country without judgmental eyeballs.

When he finally got it in gear why did he not take asthma relief supplies with him while looking for the child? Why didn't he take any medical supplies with him when he was ""kidnapped"" for the house call? And what rural country folks would not have immediately looked for a tick? I shan't go on.

It's not really a faith based movie, but shows the power of kindness and community. Edie McClurg lends her charm to the film, always fun to watch. Bellamy Young seems like an odd choice to be in such a conservative movie, but she shines with charm and evens out the woodenness of the other actors.

You walk away from this movie feeling like a better person and that is a good thing.  The cast also includes one of my favorite character actors, Mickey Jones.  I appreciated seeing him in this production.

The down side.  The over the top use of stereotype Southern characters at the beginning of the movie was irksome.  I would have stopped watching it the early on the first time I watched it if the lead characters had not been so engaging.  Fortunantly you finally get to see the person and not the stereotype poor country folk fairly quickly into the movie.  The ending, which I won't reveal, shows the supporting characters as the decent, friendly, supportive and caring people that more closely resemble the people I know in the rural South.  The climax was kind of 'eh' but given the movie it fit perfectly.  Get some popcorn, someone you love, hope for a rainy day and sit back and enjoy.",1490400000,4,1149,4.573529411764706

3330822,4,B0012RLXAG,I've watched it a few times. It is a bit like Doc Hollywood but cleaner and the other doctor movie with the Christian actress from full house where she got time for speeding tickets in a little town to be their doctor to work off tickets. Back to this movie. It so clean. A super excellent choice for family night. I remember thinking this is going to be boring but I gave it a little time. It was excellent. So worth watching this little gem. Just the right remedy for a depressing night. Enjoy.,1479859200,,496,4.287234042553192

3330840,3,B0012RLXAG,Compared to general movie fare the favorables are that it is a comfortable family movie with decent acting.  The plot is rather predictable and so are the characters giving one the feeling that the story was something seen in the past but not exactly.  The dialogue gets a little uncomfortable and irregular and the portrayal of the doctor just doesn't fit the temperament of pediatricians I have known.  Maybe there are small towns where people behave this way but I am not familiar with those.  And the criteria for choosing a department head doesn't fit here either.  Nevertheless it's one of those films that leave one with a relaxed feeling and doesn't evoke nightmares.,1478390400,,675,4.885964912280702

3331017,5,B0012RLXAG,"I enjoyed the movie. Admittedly I cried several times. It might be predictable to most people but I still appreciated the movie. If you like movies with the happy ending that are like Hallmark movies then you'll likely enjoy this one.

I'm from Chicago and have traveled to and through many states. With the exception of NY every state I have been in has a town like the one portrayed in this movie. I live about an hour from San Francisco and within 15 minutes from here there are a lot of towns like the one in this movie. I say all this because it felt unfair seeing all those negative reviews about the movie. I know from my own experience that being low income or very low income can make a doctors visit not feel worth it. When you're uneducated you don't know if the doctor is being genuine with your diagnosis. It can just as easily be said that the medical industry will say you need this treatment or lab work and other tests just to make more money. I went to the ER with no insurance and was billed $36,000 for the few hours I was there even though all I was given was an antibiotic, fluids, EKG test and chest x-ray.

Sorry for anyone who thought my review was a waste of space. I just thought the accurate portrayal of how it can be difficult in small towns in the middle of nowhere needed to be stated as still a current issue. I'm sure a lot of places have boomed over the last two decades but many are also suffering more now than before.",1472774400,55,1455,4.23021582733813

The clinic is a falling-down shack with no equipment. The medical scenarios are so far from correct that it's laughable. The story line of arrogant city doctor who has his heart melted by the residents of this small town, with of course, a love interest involved, is fairly standard, but the events leading up to the transition seem very forced.

3331115,2,B0012RLXAG,"The calculated schmaltz in the movie, especially toward the end, tempted me to give this movie 3 stars. Yea, I almost fell for it. But I resisted. The portrayal of members of an Appalachian community as mostly uneducated, stupid yahoos hit all the stereotypes on the subject. But stupidity did not stop there. It especially marked the protagonist doctor, who would leave his 10-year old asthmatic son unattended except by other preteens; who would attempt in his opening speech to the rural community a joke about ""two hillbillies and a rooster;"" who, 3 months after his wife's death, would take his grieving son to a totally new place with no friends or relatives to sustain him in order to promote his career. Ultimately, this stupidity is traceable to the scriptwriters and the movie's director. And that's why 2 stars is plenty.",1471219200,,832,4.907801418439717

Acting was okay, although some of the residents of the small town warming to the ""new city doctor"" scenes seemed too rushed. There was the obligatory ""let's have a dance"" scene and a few moments of life or death drama along the way. I wouldn't recommend for small children, although might be all right for ages 10 and above.

Several really stupid premises are best ignored if you want to watch it though.  1)  A newly-widowed father thinks it reasonable to move his 10-year-old grieving son to a strange, unfamiliar location where he knows no one...and abandons him in an isolated and silent house all day while he goes to work?  He make no arrangements for his care other than to half-heartedly ask the mayor after he arrives, who sends her kid over? Pays no attention to what he does or where he might go? Say what?  2)  The doctor arrives to run this clinic and finds a ramshackle building covered in dust and animal feces.  They knew he was coming, what gives?  And the mayor calls him bureaucratic because he has the audacity to request medical equipment? Does she expect him to poke his patients with a stick to help them? Well he is later seen using medical equipment so he must have brought his own I guess. 3) These country folks hate doctors?  Like...why?  Maybe because the ones the mayor has exposed them to earlier weren't allowed to use medical equipment so they did just poke them with sticks.",1457395200,8,1164,4.712871287128713

A very uplifting story that shows what is really important in life.  Kids that are able to play outside and not glued to electronic devices.  Neighbors that help one another where community is more important than money and status.  This town is like a modern day Mayberry!  The story was wonderful watching the doctor learn to interact with the folks in town as they learned to accept him.  The medical procedure that was depicted was a little far fetched, but it made for a good story if you use your imagination a little bit. Overall this was a great family film or great wholesome clean entertainment for adults as well.",1450656000,2,752,4.567164179104478
3331727,5,B0012RLXAG,"I liked it.  As female lead said, ""...Simple pleasures..."" which is the moral about a recently widowed city  pediatrician who is sent with his asthmatic son to NC near Asheville to help community without doctor for ten years.  About how they adapt and choices.  There is the loss of life along with birth, neglectfulness, awnriness, and then awareness and community.  Nate, the son, is bullied and lonely.  The mayor's daughter befriends him and suggests he wish hard for what to happen to the bullies and just wait.  Nate winds up dealing with the consequences of his wish.  The mayor's daughter alone is a firecracker and worth watching.  Everyone is.  Excellent family film.  The nitpick would be that the town gave him a dirty building with a broken step, no equipment, and no money, and he did not bring any equipment of his own.  This seemed very unrealistic that there wasn't a mobile medical vehicle available from the hospital that had requested he go there or the local fire department in a nearby town.  It seems like funds could be drummed up from somewhere from Ashville and the neighboring communities or clubs.  But I was in the mood to overlook that after awhile and enjoyed this movie anyway.",1449792000,,1209,4.777777777777778

One should NEVER shove an epinephrine shot into the left-side chest - this will cause a pneumothorax (puncture of the lung). Not to mention, there are other delicate organ structures in this area - should be thrust into the lateral thigh. Secondly, a tick bite looks nothing like the one in the movie - it is pale in the center (not black) and red around the sides - referred to as a bull's eye rash. Lastly, about the best medical advice I heard in the movie was not by the doctor himself but his drunken assistant who said, ""If it hurts, then don't do it!""",1446076800,,680,4.362204724409449

I was somewhat upset by the role of the young boy, son of the doctor, after they moved to North Carolina.  He had a serious medical condition, and realistically should not have been left on his own for so much of the time after the move to the small town.  Even smart, responsible children are likely to need quick, effective care for such breathing problems.

The actors and the story are very good, and the production,  but I would suggest more attention should have been given to the situation of that young boy being simply left alone for entire days after the move to a new home.",1442448000,2,725,4.4961832061068705

Best line of the movie was from the mayor's little girl:  an extended ""Whhhaaaattttt?"" with her little face kind of scrunched up and hands up.  Hilarious.",1441238400,,527,4.427083333333333

In reality, those North Carolina, Appalachian residents would have been glad to have a clinic close by rather than having to commute all the way to Asheville for their medical needs. The cabin that was supposedly the clinic? Give me a break! That was somebody's tool shed! More ridiculous stereotype.

3332287,3,B0012RLXAG,"This is a sweet story but it is unrealistic enough to be less than totally satisfying.  For instance, the small, backwards little town in North Carolina asks for a doctor to help with their health needs yet it cannot afford to give him the most rudimentary instruments such as a blood pressure gauge.  Also, the doctor is supposed to be highly-respected in a major Chicago hospital but he arrives in the town without so much as a personal medical bag.  Finally, the doctor has to deal with major health emergencies like the need for a caesarian section, done under very crude conditions.  Yet, in a following scene, someone calls the paramedics and they arrive with an ambulance.  Really!!?",1428019200,,690,4.813559322033898

If so, then Country Remedy was indeed a 5-star film, since here I am several days removed from seeing it and there are questions I just cannot get out of my head: 1) Why do they insist on referring to what is obviously a pocket watch as a compass? 2) Were the writers and directors actually aware that the film as a whole is guilty of exactly the same condescension toward rural life that Dr. Gibbs demonstrates at the town hall meeting?  3) Has anyone told the folks at AA how watching a baby being born instantly cures alcoholism?

All kidding aside, the film features an interesting cast and is competently acted, but the writers didn't give them much to work with. It's just cliche after cliche. The scenes with the basement stairs kind of made me wonder whether whether this couldn't be re-edited as a horror movie... ""The Remedy.""

3332368,2,B0012RLXAG,"*SPOILER ALERT*
We all with children know how hard it can be to find a decent happy feel good movie for family movie nights. Came across this movie, thought based on the vague description that it was going to be about a father and son taking a trip and the father realizing he had been working too much and that he needed to make more time for his son, they come back home with a new understanding of each other and a stronger bond Yada yada yada.....the movie starts out with this young boy dressed for his mothers funeral. They do go on a trip together where the father leaves the boy alone in the house (a run down cabin on a mountain) they are staying at while he goes to work and it shows the son hearing all the weird sounds a strange house can make and it shows him being scared. I think in the movie, the boy is 10 years old. It also shows him making a wish for something to happen to a bully and then later the bully is having to be rushed to hospital and is near death. It then shows a lady going in to labor but something is wrong and has blood all down front of her dress. The baby is born, all is well. The boy whose father leaves him alone, makes friends. It shows that the boy has asthma. It shows the boy taking off into the woods without his inhaler, stopping reaching for his inhaler while getting ready to start gasping for air, the scene immediately changes to the newborn baby's father putting his hand on the baby and the baby not moving and him telling the mother something was wrong that the baby wasn't moving. That's when we turned it off quickly!
I just don't get why when you find a movie that doesn't have all the bad language, violent and/or sexual stuff in it, you get movies that mess with a child's emotions in such a negative way. Maybe this movie got a little more positive toward the end but based on all we saw just in the beginning, we wasn't going to watch to find out.",1426636800,2,1908,4.15945945945946

3332727,4,B0012RLXAG,"Country Remedy (a.k.a. Simple Things) generates this Hallmark Channel vibe, and that's not a bad thing. Country Remedy is an indie family drama with many flashes of humor. In a way, it's a more sober take on Michael J. Fox's similarly-veined comedy, Doc Hollywood. They're both essentially about an ambitious big city doctor who somehow end up in a small hick town he can't wait to get out of.

Dr. Evan Gibbs (Cameron Bancroft) is a three-months-widowed doctor from Chicago. He's now raising his 10-year-old son Nate (Aidan Mitchell) on his own, and he wants to do right by the kid. But his paternal instincts are warring with his career ambitions. At his hospital he's jonesing for that promotion to head of the Pediatrician Department. As a stepping stone to securing that post, his boss tasks Gibbs with spending the summer at the remote mountain town of Dunn's Rock, North Carolina and opening a clinic there.

In Dunn's Rock Dr. Gibbs is aghast at the rickety shack masquerading as his clinic (and that's even before he finds out about the rats). He's not off at the best start as he gets on the wrong footing with the pretty town mayor (Bellamy Young) whom he initially assumes (and scolds) as his nurse. Yeah, son, Dr. Gibbs embodies the worst of the big city doctor stereotypes. He is callous and condescending and pompous and oh so awkward in his interactions with the hardy locals. That town hall meeting made me cringe. When he bemoans the lack of his office's medical equipment, the mayor pretty much tells him to improvise and make do, her own tactful version of shut-up juice.

Predictably, it's tough times for the doc. Dunn's Rock is slow to warm to newcomers and generally untrusting of physicians. It's deep into the film before Dr. Gibbs gains enough trust within the obstinate community that he's able to build up a clientele. And it's a colorful community to draw from: from the routinely inebriated handyman (Mickey Jones) and the fiercely self-sufficient pregnant hillbilly woman (Amber Benson, from BtVS) and the shiftless father of her child to the mayor herself and her tomboy daughter (Channing Nichols) and her taciturn pal (Zac Gardner).

It's a story that you've seen before and time and again. But the key moments come off well, with Bellamy Young simply wonderful (and naturally gorgeous) as the insightful mayor. Familiar themes are addressed, that of coming to terms with loss and reconnecting and acclimating to strange environments and easing up and taking it all in. Somewhen, Dr. Gibbs gets over himself and settles into the leisurely rhythms of Dunn's Rock. And are you so surprised that the movie title refers not to what Dr. Gibbs doles out to his patients but to healing that's applied to the good doctor himself? He's got a savvy boss back there in Chicago.

One thing. Dr. Gibbs' icebreaker at the town hall meeting: ""Have you heard the one about the two rednecks and the rooster?"" I wish that stone-cold crowd ahad let Dr. Gibbs finish that joke.

Another thing: Did the movie set up Dr. Gibbs' son as asthmatic before that climactic scene? Because, to me, it seemed to come out of nowhere. Maybe they established that when I went to raid the fridge (shout out to tuna melt sandwich!).",1412035200,18,3231,4.802158273381295

The paint on the wall will start to peel and you may notice by the end of it that you accidentally chewed your entire arm off, and may have even gotten started on part of your foot

IF you continue to watch it in hopes that it will ''pick up'' or have a ''twist'' then I would advise you to check your pulse at regular intervals to make sure you are still alive because I assure you, it will not ''pick up'' and does not EVER have a ''twist'' such as stated in the description and / or other reviews i read. Just so you know, I was not in search of an exciting movie this evening but it would have been nice if it were in the least bit emotionally or intellectually stimulating...like, just a little that would have been great.

And since we are now on the topic of the other reviews now. I noticed this movie was rated almost 5 stars which is rare for any movie. So let it be known that all of the reviews were either written by folks from that little town that this movie was filmed in, by people who made the movie, or by people who are on life support in a nursing home. No normal person in their right mind would like this movie, no matter what you are in to.

This movie starts off, picks up and ends with depressed people moving around from scene to scene at the speed of death, mixed in with the occasional intoxicated half mentally handicapped Carolina mountain person.

So for the sake of almost 2 hrs of your life, please click away.",1409270400,12,1542,4.147157190635451

QUICK SYNOPSIS

The big city doctor is going through one mental crisis while his ten-year-old son is going through his own mental challenges, both dealing with the death of their wife and mother.

Meanwhile, the doctor has been given a deal, spend the summer in a small town in the mountains area of North Carolina and he'll get a big promotion at work. Most people know that by the end of the movie, he will stay where he is needed, but there are plenty of surprises along the way.

It's the surprises that make this a wonderful movie. It's a big change of lifestyle to move from Chicago to ultra-rural North Carolina, and the citizenry have to take their time deciding to trust the new-fangled city-slicker of a doctor, while some of the kids of the area have to decide whether to like or hate his son.

Do get this movie. You'll love it. Or watch it with free downloading on Amazon Prime, like I did. You'll be glad you did.",1408579200,,1111,4.29665071770335

But he neglects his 11 year old son, in a clumsy attempt to give him privacy and independence.  The child also feels the loss of his mother and becomes acutely aware of the painful distance between father and son, and tries to run away and nearly dies.  This breaks the ice in Daddy's heart.

The colorful characters of the community add humor and warmth to the story. Actress Bellamy Young is pitch perfect from her character's first encounter with the Dr. Gibbs.

And sometimes it is- the film has some serious holes. It is trope-y and predictable at times, the doctor basically brushes aside the fact that a young girl is having grand mal seizures so there can be a joke about trading medical care for cucumbers. And it is completely white-washed. But there is something really special about this movie- and I think its because the acting and directing are very very good. The lead especially, infuses so many layers and depth to his performance. The entire cast is great, all moving beyond their stereotypical roles and bringing about fully fleshed out characters,  language that could be flat is full of life and meaning, and because of that ,we are drawn in.",1519776000,,853,4.724832214765101
