8042927,3,B0006SSSSC,"In this movie no body plays any instrument. The music is taken from the cd ""Willie and the Poor Boys"" (which I like very much) and the musicians pretend to play. I did not see Jimmy Page anywhere and some times some of the musicians pretend to play in songs where they do not appear in the original cd. It is a fun movie, but I thought, before I bought it, that they played for real. For this reason I find more interesting the back stage film. 0n the sleeve they do not mention these facts, and they make you think the musicians play for real.",1248652800,4,544,4.1415094339622645
