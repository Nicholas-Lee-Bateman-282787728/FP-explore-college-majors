8574779,2,B00BWP0MR8,"This double disc ""collector's box"" was incredibly....INCREDIBLY disappointing. The first disc was a documentary I'd seen on tele ages ago, NOT authorized I believe by the band themselves. Actually, the whole ""box set"" itself wasn't authorized. The second disc was snippets of random interviews (in no particular order) that all blended altogether. It was as if someone tapped them via VHS and used an editing program to piece it all into one. The sound and picture quality are of course OK on some and terrible on others.

I did get this as a gift, so I'm not TOO upset, however I could have just searched interviews on Youtube.",1412467200,2,628,4.814814814814815
8574780,5,B00BWP0MR8,Who doesn't like Depeche Mode.  Anything they do is awesome!,1406851200,,60,5.0
8574781,3,B00BWP0MR8,Basically it a documentary about peers of Depeche Mode and (some small interviews clips with Martin and an old band member) talking about Depeche Mode.  It is informative and the people they are talking to are somewhat peers of theirs from the electronic music movement Britain and throughout the world.  If you are a serious fan of Depeche Mode and you have to buy it go ahead but don't expect much from it.  If you are just an avid to infrequent fan I would probably pass on this item.,1388188800,4,487,4.449438202247191
8574782,2,B00BWP0MR8,"There was some interesting information but overall kind of disappointed. Great interviews, no original music. Good to view once maybe twice.",1383350400,,140,5.714285714285714
8574783,2,B00BWP0MR8,"Let's get the most important thing out of the way.  The band had nothing to do with this release.  I've only watched a portion of the Interview's disk and I'm not sure I'll finish it.  It is collected TV interviews with members of the band, the quality isn't great, in the first interview which was done for MTV you cannot even hear the questions that are being asked.  Martin looks bored to tears through most of it.  And this disk continues for close to 2 hours.  The other disk is an unofficial history, I may give it a look.  But this is a very disappointing release.  Leave it alone.",1371513600,28,588,4.330275229357798
