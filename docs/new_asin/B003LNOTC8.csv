So I'll confine further commentary to the opera itself.  As said, this is in my opinion beyond doubt the greatest opera of the 20th century.  Despite its difficult music for the Verdi imbibers, it's always a huge success.  My wife & I saw it at the Met some years ago, a couple of days after 'Parsifal', and lo and behold, the reviewer picked those two as the grandest achievements of the entire season.

This version includes the completion of the opera  by F Cerha, certainly the one to get.  Berg died before he was able to finish the work, and Cerha's ending is totally persuasive.

The 20th cenury was not the greatest for opera.  I would say Lulu, Woyzzeck and Peter Grimes stand out, and that's about it.  Yet those three can measure up to about anything the earlier centuries can throw at them.",1326931200,,1036,4.516129032258065
8399739,2,B003LNOTC8,"I purchased LULU because Julia Migenes is in it.  I guess I do not understand Berg's music.  I found it was all over the place.  I describe it as throwing all different colors on a canvas without thought and it lands as it does.  I don't like it.  I would think it would be hard for Levine to conduct let alone the singers starting their parts.  It was harsh and not pleasant to hear in my view and my view only.  There may be a lot of Berg fans out there but I know I am not one of them as of yet.  I would have to see something else first.  I like the story plot and I guess I was looking for some sweet melody or a familar aria.  I still like Julia Migenes in this but I just was not wild about this Opera.

This will be my first and last LULU purchase.  It does not fit my ears.",1290297600,2,782,3.7888198757763973
8399740,5,B003LNOTC8,"This is a true gem. Berg is deservedly famous for Wozzeck but honestly I enjoyed Lulu much more. It is the complete edition with all three acts and includes the introduction from the circus ringleader. This definitely isn't a family show (watch with all the lights off too!)

Another plus is that the setting is accurate to the libretto. Being a 20th century opera its rare performances have been prone to regietheater settings. Here though the accurate staging includes every action dictated; the production team could not have done it more justice. We see Lulu interacting with all the characters, ensnaring and ""poisoning"" her unsuspecting victims, just as the ringleader assured us. All acting and action was spot-on and believable (that is as believable as can be for the surreal setting and story). The serial music may be a shock for people who aren't familiar with what it is or its roots, but I actually think this opera would be a perfect introduction to it.

For video quality: It must be remembered that this was a telecast in 1980. Audio and Video recording sure has come a long way in the last thirty years, so certain technical issues will have to be forgiven, but they aren't distracting. Due to microphone placement there are points where the singers cannot be heard as clearly. Since the stage was dimly lit there are moments where we can't see as much detail, and shadows overtake the sight.

If you are going to have the subtitles on, also keep in mind that the libretto will on occasion move incredibly fast and multiple characters will say multiple things at once. You will not see everything at these points, but instead the key lines.

All in all, I was absolutely floored. I'd recommend this to people who want to get others interested in opera; I showed it to a friend of mine who even snickered, ""An opera?"" I simply showed one scene, and he was stunned. Perhaps I sparked his interest?",1274832000,21,1913,4.718562874251497
8399741,5,B003LNOTC8,"Having just returned from seeing the Met Opera's May 15, 2010 production of Berg's Lulu, I must say the 1977 sets of John Dexter hold up well... What a cast I saw that afternoon... returning home and playing this DVD, it was as if this was just an alternate cast of what I saw that afternoon in 2010. It mirrored what's on this DVD... the standouts here are the Lulu of Julia Mingenes; all the notes, her use of body language, and her eyes. Dr Schon/Jack the Ripper of Franz Mazur; what a voice, outstanding. Alwa of Kenneth Riegel, no milk-toast, but riveting as the dog following Lulu to his end. Countess Geschwitz; Evelyn Lear, outstanding in every way. The rest of the cast, outstanding as well. What's even better, all of Berg's instructions were followed... right down to the minute detail. IE: During Dr. Schon's manic faze in Act 2 before he's shot by Lulu, he's waving the gun around, he sees Lulu's pursuers around every corner. Berg coded those movements in the score, and they pop up as as they dart around the room.

I was so pleased to have seen the Met's live 2010 Lulu, back-to-back, with this DVD. That says how good the this DVD is...",1274486400,15,1153,4.4904761904761905
