823041,3,6304252307,"I do not know why there are not more movies based on great historical events or eras. I speak of films on par with Braveheart, or Rob Roy, for example. There are very few movies based on the Viking age, or having anything to do with Scandinavia for that matter. Unfortunately, most Viking movies seem to be grade ""B"" affairs, and this is a huge injustice to the complex nature of the Sagas. In the ""plot summary"" for this site, a stupid reviewer describes it as ""a time when conflicts weren't solved with intellect, but with swords"". That reviewer obviously has never read a Nordic Saga, and has no understanding of Scandinavian culture. In fact, negotiation and diplomacy were often as highly esteemed as prowess in battle. The differance is, Men of that age were not afraid to stand up to their enemies in combat. In our time, a loud mouth is the only acceptable ""weapon"".

If literate people were running the production studios in Hollywood, perhaps we would see a lot more films based on the sagas of Scandinavia. The potential for great historical drama is enormous!

This film is loosely based on the Laxardal Saga from Iceland. I found it to be quite enjoyable, and the Icelandic scenery is a major feature. It could have been more than what it is, however, being somewhat of an action-movie, to a degree. It portays the Laxardal Saga characters Kjartan and Gudrun, but does not really portray the story as it is written in the saga.",1161475200,45,1440,4.643137254901961
823042,5,6304252307,"If you are interested in the sagas and want to see them as a movie, this is an excellent 5 star attempt at it, and you won't be disappointed. Ok maybe 4.5 stars, but it is very good if you have more than a passing interest in the sagas.

If you are after a more ""popular"" movie though, perhaps an action movie somewhat related to vikings, then you might only give this 3.5 stars, and call it a B grade movie. Even then you may find it entertaining, but it is not super-fantastic.

The story is interesting, the behaviour of the people realistic, the settings are excellent and authentic (I've been to all those locations and in reality they are even more beautiful) ... they've even used Icelandic horses (with their unique gait) which was good to see.

Very enjoyable, especially if interested in the sagas. Wish they would make more movies of them.",1118275200,46,850,4.5064935064935066
823043,4,6304252307,"Truly an interesting movie.  To honestly review this movie is difficult as the movie was lucky to even be produced.  Becuase of its limited budget, the effects are there but will leave you yawning more than anything else, and the acting is ok, but could have been better (or worse).
Still, understanding that the movie had almost everything working against it, it deserves to be given some slack.  Besides, the story is one of the better movie plots I have seen in the past few years and the scenery is beautiful.  Furthermore, the buildings are authentic to the time period and the movie leaves behind most historical fiction movies for historical accuracy.",1038873600,18,658,4.848214285714286

The sagas make 'The Hatfields and McCoys feud' look like child's play. Very realistic props, attitudes and characters. Ralf Moeller was good enough for 'Gladiator' right? I just wish it could have been more exciting like 'The Thirteenth Warrior'.",982800000,13,393,4.7101449275362315

It has very few flaws and I must admit that seing the  movie makes you crave for a trip to Iceland as the scenery is beautiful. Of  course this is a low budget movie, so the chieftains'army isn't as big as  it should but the costumes are quite adequate to the place and period(good  research). The saga itself is wonderfully woven dispite the (I must  admit...) average (very average...) acting by a couple of actors but some  of them I would like to see in another movie as they reached me for their  excellent ""role-play"". I have not seen any anachronism as to the  weapons, armor, use of iceland ponies, clothing, buildings, social values  and demeanour.

823454,5,6304252307,"First and foremost Ralph Moeller is constantly being slammed as a bad actor, I'd like to see you tell him to his face!!! The world of action movies isn't exactly expected to produce academy award winning actors. Ralph like Arnold Schwarzenegger is a living special effect! And his acting isn't really all that bad. I haven't read the Norse Saga's so I can't rate this movie based on its literary accuracy. I can only say I enjoyed it. The scenery is spectacular and it doe's appear to be accurate to ancient Nordic weapon's and costumes. The biggest surprise for me was seeing Sven-Ole Thorsen's acting ability. You may recognize him from bit roles in many Schwarzenegger films, starting with ""Conan"" as one of the two big warrior's protecting James Earl Jones. Also ""The Running Man"" He is the security guard that refuses to help Richard Dawson saying ""I've got to score some steroids."" and the movie Kull as the king who hands Kevin Sorbo the crown. I was rather impressed, not expecting much. If your a big sword and sorcery nut like myself I love anything with sword play in it, you may want to add this to your collection. If your a big Viking movie fan this is probably a must own movie for you. I watch movies to be entertained not to critic every little thing and this movie entertained me for all 83 minutes of it. I also rate movies for what they are & knowing this was never made to compete for a Oscar I rate it high for succeeding in doing what it was made to do.",1373068800,,1476,4.430147058823529

It is a medieval story in Iceland, and very well done for what it is: a tale of the kind of authentic Icelandic sagas.  Spectacular scenery of Iceland, and authentic clothing and equipment. They even have those Icelandic ponies that can trot all day carrying a big man, and as sure-footed as goats over the stony ground (yes, the ponies are 100 percent authentic).  Not a boring story! Courage galore, honor (the real kind: integrity) and sometimes passions get the better of even the good guys. Interesting aspects of Norse culture come out, too.

Now I see that they are like many other tales of strength, wisdom, love, lust which make the world go round. I especially liked the Icelandic ponies! It's fun to see the big strong people ride them as they trot around on their dinky legs. I like that the women get to kill people too.

823459,2,6304252307,"Viking Sagas has Icelandic scenery and actors (thought the dialogue is in English), and the characters ride Icelandic ponies. Also some (though not all) of the material culture looks authentic. But the story gives us a wavering and often distorted view of medieval Iceland as portrayed in the sagas. However, there are several Icelandic films based on the sagas that are much more authentic, with the Icelandic actors speaking their own language. Utlaginn (Outlaw: The Saga of Gisli), directed by Agust Guthmundsson (which I review on IMDb) stays closest to its source. Then there is the Raven trilogy directed by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson, of which I managed to find the first two on DVD: Hrafnin Flygur (The Raven Flies); and I Skugga Hrafnsins (Shadow of the Raven). They are also very authentic in setting and characterization, although the style and cinematography show the influence of other film makers. All of these films take the audience back into a medieval Iceland that would be recognizable to anyone who has read and been fascinated by the Icelandic sagas and chronicles.",1352246400,,1078,5.096045197740113

It perfectly depicts the way family grudges and vendettas were carried from one generation to the next by Norwegians, and Norwegian settlers in Iceland and Greenland. The characters, drama and action scenes are believable and well portrayed. It is head and shoulders above the typical BBC and History Channel material.",1277683200,2,516,5.228915662650603

823463,4,6304252307,"This movie was obviously an attempt to create a new ""Viking Saga"" based on Icelandic saga material.  The student of the Sagas will find much that is familiar as some scenes are only slightly modified from Njal's Saga and some characters are clearly modelled on characters from a wide number of sagas.  For example Magnus is modelled on Njal, while Gunnar seems to be modelled both on Gunnar in Njal's Saga and Kjartan in the Laxdaela Saga.  Kjartan on the other hand seems partly modelled after both Bolli and Kjartan in the Laxdaela Saga.  Influence can be seen from those sagas plus (possibly) Grettir's Saga and the Eyrbiggja Saga.  The movie generally succeeds at mimicking some of the stylistic elements of the Sagas themselves.

However, the movie seems to fall apart in some other important ways.  I found the narration to be at times monotonous, and the good vs evil themes in the movie seemed rather foreign to the genre.  The Lawspeaker (a short-term role) was turned into a heredetary Lawgiver role reminiscent of a sacral king, and the fight at the Althing was put in for plot reasons, not because of any case of such a thing happening in the Sagas.  These elements significantly detracted from the overall movie.  It would be nice to see a much better movie based on the sorts of stories the Sagas excel at-- family histories, tales of the human condition, and the like.

I thought the acting was good and the cinematography well done as well.  Worth seeing but not fantastic.",1250640000,7,1489,4.728682170542636
823603,2,6304252307,Not to bad but could have been much better. Historicaly it was pretty much on the button though.,1240444800,,96,4.388888888888889
823604,4,6304252307,"Within the space of a couple of days I watched both ""A Viking Saga: Son of Thor"" and ""The Viking Sagas"".  Two very different films despite their similar titles.  I am a fan and supporter of low budget historical films and these two films have a lot in common and yet at the same time, are very different.  ""A Viking Saga: Son of Thor"" was done more as a minor educational film, they use that term ""educational"" a lot in their advertisements and after watching it, it seems more like something funded by a museum than a sincere attempt to do justice to the subject as a full-on adventure film.  The film is centered around a longhouse recreation, perhaps the museum I suspect this was done for, and a small group of Viking re-enactors.  Amazon's brief description is the whole movie; it is a very simple plot, with constant flashbacks to the attack on the young boy's village as the only major action in the film.  The longships on the cover are not in the film, there are only two much smaller ships used for trading.  The story is basically a Swedish one, with an emphasis on trading and the river routes down into what was later to be known as Russia.  It is a very interesting aspect of Viking history, but unfortunately, it is handled in the most simplistic of ways.  Even a die hard Viking fan like me will be hard pressed to appreciate this movie.  The concept is excellent from a historical point of view; the execution however seemed to be done very simply and cheaply.  I honestly cannot recommend this movie.

""The Viking Sagas"" is very different.  Not a big budget Hollywood historical epic, it still has a lot going for it.  Shot entirely in Iceland, where the story takes place, it is a classic tale of revenge and reversal.  The plot is very atypical and has some interesting and complex turns, and much of those are based on an actual history and on the Icelandic judicial system that does indeed go back to the Viking colonial days.  I quickly found myself curious how it would play out, though there was no doubt our hero would triumph.  The scenery is beautiful and stark and knowing a bit about Viking horses, the Icelandic ponies were a nice refreshing historical touch.  The star is Ralf Moeller and he is fairly wooden and too muscle-bound for the untrained warrior he is supposed to be, but I can let that slide.  To me, the ""name"" in this movie is Sven-Ole Thorsen, the ""Swedish Champion"" from Sam Raimi's ""The Quick and the Dead"".  He shows up as a minor character or stunt actor in enough movies that he almost seems like a new Alan Hale Senior to me.  His character is the archetypical ""martial arts master"" but he too has an interesting twist to him plot wise.  This film is not epic, has some B-movie qualities, but if you like adventure films like that, then I suspect you will like this one.",1229817600,8,2822,4.481409001956947
823605,2,6304252307,"I should qualify this negative review by warning up front that when it comes to movies--and for that matter, books, too--about the Vikings I am a nitpicker, and in fairness I should explain why. I'm the author of the Strongbow Saga, a historical fiction series set during the Viking era. I've spent many years of research, and much effort, trying to gain an in-depth knowledge of the Vikings' culture, history, and the period in which they lived so that I can accurately portray them in my novels. The Vikings have long been misunderstood and misrepresented, in print and on film, and I hate to see this continuing to occur.

The writers of the screenplay for this movie clearly drew on several old Icelandic sagas about the Vikings. Portions of the plot bear a strong resemblance to portions of Njal's Saga, and some of the main characters are loosely drawn from the Laxardal Saga. However, rather than trying to create a historically accurate portrayal of the Vikings, the film makers instead opted to make a low budget fantasy film that ends up being sort of a cross between pseudo-history and Conan the Barbarian. And the acting of Ralph Moeller, who plays the role of the movie's hero Kjartan, is very evocative of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Conan: both actors have hugely muscled builds and deliver their lines with all the feeling of a talking tree trunk. Moreover, when a film director has to rely on a voice-over narration to explain the story because the filmed scenes are too incoherent to convey it without an explanation, you know you're dealing with a weak piece of storytelling.

The list of why this film should not be considered a historically accurate portrayal of the Vikings is too long to fit into a short review, but let me point out a few of the more glaring flaws. The costumes look more like early Scottish garb than Viking attire--so much so, that I wondered if the film makers were not reusing old costumes from Braveheart. There are some accurate Viking-era weapons on the screen, though mostly on the belts of extras, but the story's main characters use long handled, two-handed swords that are the purely the stuff of B grade fantasy, and Kjartan even wears his sword slung across his back--again channeling Conan. This kind of detail is not hard to get right--there's no excuse for not doing so.

Nevertheless, if you watch this movie for what it is--a low budget fantasy film set in the visually stunning scenery of Iceland--it will not disappoint your expectations. But as for me, I'm still looking for a film that accurately portrays the Vikings as they really were.",1225670400,6,2597,4.805369127516778
823606,5,6304252307,"The Viking Saga is more of a drama than the usual type of action movie that Ralph Moeller (Conan the Series) stars in. His role is not the typical ""invincible"" warrior. His character actually does not know how to fight in the beginning of the movie. In fact, Moeller must be trained to avenge his fathers death. The knife and sword training scenes are fun to watch.
This role is very different than his characters in such movies as Best of the Best or Gladiator. I feel it is good for an actor to explore different types of roles and images so his/her movies don't all appear too similiar.

The acting is decent. Due to the low budget, there are some minor flaws with this movie. However, I found it to be provacative and intriguing as many aspects of past Viking customs are shown.

The story is a combination and simplified tale taken from various sagas.

823609,1,6304252307,"Being half Norwegian, I've been on a mission to find good Norse/Viking films for a while now and I gave this one a buy before trying because of that. Well, I struck out here as this is one of the worst excuses for a viking action film I've seen yet. To say it's only very loosely viking is being overly generous. There's really nothing here of factual viking history or heritage.

The story is basic but it can be hard to follow as your thrown alot of names and aren't always given the time to know exactly who they're talking about. As the lead man, I thought Ralf Moeller was stiff and lifeless. Granted, he didn't have the best script and dialog to deal with but I think he's just not charasmatic enough for a hero role. None of the other actors impressed here at all and I found some of the casting highly questionable.

There was nothing and no one here to care anything about no matter what happens. The bad guys were bad but not too bad. Moeller plays the hero who's destiny is to become a great warrior but he keeps getting his butt kicked throughout most of the film. His master/teacher is supposedly the greatest warrior in the land but is old, out of shape and in no way believeable. Moeller just seems to keep wanting to get it on with this one girl most of the time and they have some stupidly unpassionate love scenes that are only there to show unappreciated and gratuitous nudity. Then his master/teacher goes on a killing spree because he wanted Moellers chick even though he's old enough to be her grandfather. I mean, he slaughters a whole village full of people over it and everyone just forgives him for it like nothing happened. Mr. Miagi in the Karate Kid would never do that. Besides, isn't he supposed to be a good guy here? Uh, ok? The swordplay is basic and boring, the blood effects are cheesy and the only thing climactic about the ending was that it was ending. The only redeeming value here are the nice landscapes to look at. That's it.

I won't bother reviewing the audio/video here as it's just not worth it.

So for anyone else looking for a good Viking film, keep looking and let me know what you find. For anyone who likes old tyme sword fighting action flicks like Conan, Beastmaster and Gladiator, watch those instead. There's a reason why most people never heard of this film. Personally, I'm trying hard to forget it and I'm glad there are places to sell junk like this. Avoid.",1200182400,8,2418,4.4391891891891895
823610,1,6304252307,"I can say without hesitation that The Viking Sagas is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have sat through more than a few bad movies, and so let me insist that this claim is no hyperbolic gesture. It simply would not be enough to say that this is merely a bad movie. There are scores of terrible films out there with senseless plots, tepid action sequences and ham-handed direction - and many of them also feature German body-building champions in prominent roles.

No, what sets The Viking Sagas apart as being truly, profoundly awful, is that it inspires ignorance, specifically, false understanding of a complex and often strange culture. A number of reviewers praise this film for its allegiance to the source material: they do so, I believe, in error. I have studied dozens of sagas, in English and Old Norse, and I have no idea what story this film is supposed to be based on. The screenwriter's folly is the actors' tragedy - the Icelandic cast is made complicit in the betrayal and debasement of a literary heritage with which they are no doubt closely familiar and rightfully proud. Creating a wholly new story would of course have been fair game if the writers had remained true to the spirit of the sagas, but this film owes much more to Star Wars than Sturluson. The reviewer who posits that the script is based on Laxdlasaga is too generous by far. He is correct that the names ""Kjartan"" and ""Gudrun"" were boosted from that story, but the similarities end there. Even more puzzling is how, with a cast of dozens of Icelanders, the pronunciations of the names Kjartan and Kjetil were so viciously butchered.

One suspects that the director is at fault for these crimes and many more. Indeed, much blame ought to fall on Mr. Chapman, that swan of the cinema who brought us both ""Space Jam"" and ""Kindergarten Cop."" For being invisible behind the camera, however, he comes off as a more sympathetic figure than the film's blundering star, who appears as a crudely shaped tree stump dreadfully miscast as a speaking person. Special mention must also be made of whoever took it upon him- or herself to soften the lead's image by giving him a feathered hairdo. His bonny curls just scream ""viking blood feud.""

I agree that there really ought to be a good viking movie, but The Viking Sagas is a step backward, not forward. Any reasonably clever filmmaker who will just take the time to read - read! - the sagas themselves and chat with someone who knows a thing or two about them will find a rich, untapped vein of narrative from which any number of compelling movies could be made. Until then, for anyone that was intrigued by this movie, you'll get a better sense of the viking age by watching a black metal music video - or checking out any one of the many excellent translations of the sags that are widely available. To be fair, this movie is not unremittingly awful. The costumes and sets were all quite good, and the weather - stormy, windy, and always overcast - was unmistakably Icelandic.",1169596800,12,3014,4.619402985074627

7866441,3,6304252307,"Released in 1995, The Viking Sagas stars Ralf Moeller as Kjartan, a Viking in Iceland who romances a blond beauty (Ingibjrg Stefnsdttir) and trains to fight with the greatest warrior on the island, Gunnar (Sven-Ole Thorsen), for the purpose of vengeance, honor and freedom.

The first time I saw The Viking Sagas I had just viewed the first season of the excellent TV series Vikings and was almost shocked by the lameness of certain aspects, like some of the acting by body-builder Moeller and the weak story-telling, etc. At the beginning of the film Kjartan is supposed to be some inexperienced farm boy when its clear that hes at least 35, not to mention a totally hulking badaxx (hes over 65). Theres a scene where he takes on a swordsman and is swiftly beaten, but its not convincing in light of Kjartans utterly intimidating presence. Even if he didn't know how to use a sword, its clear that he couldve rushed the guy and torn him in half with his bare hands.

Seeing it again, I was braced for these deficiencies and was able to enjoy the movie to some degree, at least more so than my first viewing. The plots fine, its just that the way the story is told fails to absorb, although there are several compelling parts. Stefnsdttir gets semi-nekkid during a couple of tasteful love scenes. Some guys find her thoroughly ravishing and shes certainly good-looking; shes just too tall & slinky for my tastes. Some of the fight scenes are quite brutal, but others are kinda unconvincing. So the whole films a mix of good and bad. Nevertheless, the Icelandic photography and the score are great and its nice to see Sven-Ole Thorsen (he played Thorgrim in 1982s Conan the Barbarian). If you can overlook (or embrace) the films weaknesses, it DOES take you back to Viking-era Iceland and effectively provides a glimpse of what it mustve been like, e.g. the apparel and living conditions. I suppose its a semi-guilty pleasure, but be forewarned: Youll likely be turned off the first time you see it.

The film runs 83 minutes and was shot entirely in Iceland.
