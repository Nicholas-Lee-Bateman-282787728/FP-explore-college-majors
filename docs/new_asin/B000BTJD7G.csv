2441256,5,B000BTJD7G,"No, this is not a new workout, but a compilation. That said, it is great for anyone choosing to emphasize weight lifting in their workouts(as opposed to so much cardio).The weight lifting is what made the Firm so much more effective than other workouts. If you have most of the Firm's, then you do have this workout, except the compilation form mixes up sets and instructors for variety, which I like. As for the nudity, I think there is an extremely blurry image of an obese woman in the beginning of the old Firm workouts, nothing at all graphic. I'm a Firm die-hard because it is the only thing that ever worked for me, mainly by forcing me to lift weights. Great workout!",1151625600,11,675,4.495934959349594
2441257,1,B000BTJD7G,"If you have any Firm videos at all, you probably have this compilation.  The cover leads you to believe it's all new stuff, but it is a compilation of all the old videos, and they are very outdated.  Yet another marketing gimmick like others have used (Karen Voight) to make you think you're getting something brand new, when in reality, you probably already own it in one form or another.  Disappointing and a waste of twenty bucks.",1150416000,7,433,4.597402597402597
2441258,1,B000BTJD7G,"I thought this was a new workout with Allie. IT IS OLD WORKOUTS!!!! The stage and workoutfits look to be from the 1980's or early 1990.  I didn't even see Allie yet.  Plus there is a segment at the beginning with nudity that I did not appreciate, as I have family members who have had a problem with porn in the past. No warning re: the nudity or anything. This really ticked me off. I am going to try and return it because it's just not what I was expecting from the Firm. I have been extremely happy with their transfirmer series, but this stinks!",1147305600,7,549,4.219047619047619
2441259,4,B000BTJD7G,"First, I have to preface this by saying I do prefer the work done by the original Firm Producers than Good Times.  I also like weight training that also works the cardiovascular system somewhat. So yes, I like this DVD.  Its nice to have choices-as others have said, you can do one of 3 workouts and even though this is a ""parts"" tape, it flows very well.  its a keep for me.",1142985600,14,375,4.180555555555555
2441260,4,B000BTJD7G,"Based on the other reviews here I wish I would have written this one sooner.  Yes, this is a Firm Parts video containing footage from a variety of their older videos ranging from 1994-1999, similar to Total Body Shaping Mix, Lower and Upper Body Split, Tough Tape 2, etc.  However this particular video has been out of print for a few years, harder to find and has gone for big $$$ on Ebay.  I was glad to hear they were going to re-release it on DVD, but they did do that with a new cover which I could certainly see how that might confuse some people thinking this was a new workout.

This workout contains 2 separate workouts, each containing different clips, you can do them individually as they each run about 40 minutes or so, or you can combine the two of them for a 70 plus minute workout.  Towards the end of workout 1, it will be noted on the screen to fast forward through the next few clips, then it is shown when you can resume play and continue on with the workout.  The clips that are skipped are the abs, cooldown and warmup for the next workout.  Here is a breakdown of each workout and what original video it came from...

Workout 1 - 42 minutes

warmup with small weighted ball, abs, pushups, planks (new film footage)
stretch - Super Cardio
ball aerobics (hi-lo impact) - Super Cardio
T bar rows, biceps, double arm rows - Firm Strength
squats, military press, leg press - Tortoise
french press, tricep kickbacks - Cardio Burn
lunges/dips/squats - Firm Strength
tricep dips, one arm rows, biceps - Super Sculpting
squats, upright rows, leg press - Tortoise
low impact aerobics - Firm Basics Sculpting w/Weights
pec flies, ribcage pullover, skullcrushers - Max Body Shaping
pushups, spinal erector work - Power Cardio
*abs - Maximum Cardio
*stretch - Maximum Body Shaping

Workout 2 - 40 minutes

*warmup w/light weights - new film footage
*stretch - new film footage
*ball aerobics drill - Super Cardio
squats, plies, glute squeezes - Super Sculpting
one arm rows, tricep kickbacks, biceps - Tortoise
leg press, biceps - Firm Cardio
upright rows, front/side deltoid work - Super Sculpting
leg press, french press - Firm Cardio
one arm row, tricep kickbacks, biceps - Tortoise
squats, lunges - Super Sculpting
deadlifts (Good Mornings), bent over rows w/barbell, rear deltoid work - Super Sculpting
pushups - Better Body & Buns
bridge work, obliques, abs - Power Cardio
stretch - Cardio Burn

The starred items are the ones skipped if one were to do the both workouts together, I personally think each workout is pretty complete on it's own and both of them might be too much.
Overall I am pleased with this DVD, I like the clips they chose and each muscle group is hit sufficiently.  Most of the clips are old footage but there are some clips used that have never been seen in other videos, mainly the warmups and one of the stretch segments.  The only negatives for me were the first warmup, I didn't feel it was complete at all, you warmup for about a minute before you dive right into abs and pushups.  I also could have done without the few aerobic segments, I think they could have used a couple of other strength segments in place of these.

If you are a classic Firm fan or ""middle era"" which most of the footage here would qualify, pick this one up.  Many longtime Firm fans will be excited this is available again, including myself.  I give this one 4 stars.",1142640000,76,3387,4.579470198675497
2441261,3,B000BTJD7G,"Yes this is a disappointment.  I don't especially love The Firm at the best of time, but I'm always after new workouts to keep things interesting and I'm sorry I have this.  It is indeed The Firm's ""best ever"" toning exercises, re-edited from various 1993-1998 programs.  So yes, you might already own this.

The two workouts here alternate between upper and lower body routines.  You will need dumbells, barbell and their fanny lifter (or put your step on high).  It's about 82 minutes all up, but there's nothing totally new or interesting about this, and so I think I'll stick to almost anything else I own.",1142380800,6,610,4.7075471698113205
2441262,1,B000BTJD7G,"Do not waste your money on this.  It is very outdated.  They use previous videos from years back.  The cover makes it look like there would be something new to it but there is not.  The workout is traditional firm and if you have any of there other videos, you have what you need and will not get anything new from this.",1141344000,33,320,4.112903225806452
2441263,2,B000BTJD7G,"This DVD includes two approximately 40 minute workouts.  The DVD consists of various Firm videos / DVD's from the 80's and 90's edited together.  Each 40 minute workout starts with about 5 minutes of cardio and stretching.  There are then segments of weight work - again, older Firm DVD's cobbled together.  The instructors use various pieces of equipment - hand weights of various sizes, a bar bell, a step, a chair, and a ball. If you don't have all this equipment at home, this probably isn't the DVD for you. There's upper body and lower body toning exercises with weights or a step, but not much abdominal work.  I have been exercising regularly for a couple years, and did not find the two workouts on this DVD very challenging.  I would have preferred more intervals of cardio interspersed with intervals of toning, but the only cardio was a few minutes at the beginning of each workout.  Leslie Sansone's and Jillian Michael's interval training DVD's are much better.",1308528000,2,975,4.802395209580839
2441264,4,B000BTJD7G,"The title is misleading, there are not 3 separate workouts that are different, there are 2 different workouts and when you combine 1 and 2, that makes the 3rd workout. It explains it on the back of the DVD which is not always viewable if you order online.

For those of us that still love and use the first generation of Firm workouts, this one will work for you. Not all of the original series are available on DVD so those that are, we're happy to have.",1301616000,,455,4.2298850574712645
2441265,4,B000BTJD7G,"Teedums gave a great review of what is in the workout. I have to say that my only complaint is that I feel that switches between segments (between video segments) are a bit quick. I found myself constantly hitting pause to rewind and play again. Other than that, it was a great weight-lifting workout! My legs are soooo achy tonight, and it's been a long time since a workout made me sore.",1288224000,2,389,4.416666666666667
2441266,4,B000BTJD7G,"I know a lot of people get very irritated by the older compilations of the Firm but I like them. The older Firm videos pack a punch the new ones can't touch (I have some from every era) and so a compilation of the older ones is just up my alley.

I got my first taste of the Firm with Tough Tape 2. I was hooked. While I think they are cheesy with the pasted on smiles and no sweat it humors me enough that the workout (painful as it is) goes by quickly.
While no this is not some new workout featuring Allie.

Bootcamp has two short 40+ minute workouts that you can combine for a 71 minute workout. As a busy mom I rarely have time for 71 minutes but I can usually squeeze in just under an hour.

I didn't give it 5 stars because I wish it were an hour instead of 40 minutes and I dislike the cooldown stretches.",1236297600,8,813,3.9451219512195124
2441267,1,B000BTJD7G,"The DVD is a remix of old workouts but the exercises if done consistently will get you the results you want.  However, the advertising is misleading in many ones---first, it is dishonest in my opinion in stating that you get 3 workouts when actually #1 and #3 are duplicates.  Was this an oversight?  And, the cover does make it seem modern but it is a rehash of stuff from the early 1990's.  Prepare yourself---some of the makeup is very scary to see.",1220745600,2,452,4.475609756097561
2441268,4,B000BTJD7G,"It's another compilation, which seems to be bothering people.  Personally, I don't mind as long as the segments flow together decently.  I have found the older (yes, very dated looking) firm workouts give much better results than the newer ones.  Compile away.",1205798400,9,260,5.142857142857143
2441269,1,B000BTJD7G,"I bought this video because I like the Firm Transformer DVDs. I was looking for something new. This DVD includes outdated footage spliced together that is at first confusing to follow, though it is amusing to think that people once actually went to the gym dressed like that. I can't imagine buying another Firm DVD, ever.

Please can I have refund?",1184716800,,349,4.721311475409836

2441271,4,B000BTJD7G,Appears deceptively easy until you advance into the workout and you realise OK not as easy as thought.  As you get stronger and use heavier weights get more intense workout.  I do both workouts together to really get maximum benefit.  Only reason did not rate a 5 was I thought the abs section in both workouts too short and could be more intense.  Other than that thoroughly enjoyed.,1176163200,6,384,4.602941176470588
2441272,1,B000BTJD7G,"I was VERY disapointed with this work out video. The cover leads you to believe that it is a brand new work out when it is a variety of old out dated workouts. I feel like I wasted my money and I am very disapointed with ""the firm"" for using this type of strategy. MC",1154217600,3,267,3.8727272727272726
8092533,1,B000BTJD7G,"I got a defective copy of this, which contained two workouts and repeated the first, instead of a third workout.  The replacement I received was also defective.  In both cases, the packaging suggests it is a bootleg copy because there is no description of the workouts on the back of the DVD case, just a smaller version of the cover picture.  This one is going back for a refund.  Not happy.",1522454400,,392,4.47887323943662
8092534,5,B000BTJD7G,"I had bought this a while ago and forgot all about it as I own many of the firm workouts.  It includes segments from the ""older"" Firm workouts which in my opinion are more challenging than the new Firm workouts, also known as ""the pinks"".  I have used it a few times last week and this week alternating workout 1 and workout 2 on different days.  You will need a lot of props for this one: the fanny-lifter, barbell, weighted ball and hand weights of different sizes.  Workout 1 is about 42 minutes and workout 2 about 40 minutes.  Workout 3 combines both for a more challenging workout.

Overall it is a nice break from the newer Firm tapes.  What I love about it most is that it never gets old.  You can increase the weights as you get stronger.  Love this one!",1484179200,,763,4.27972027972028

8092539,5,B000BTJD7G,"Bought for the wife, she wanted The Firm DVD's and workout kits. She wants to get back to the way she was before we had our daughter. She likes The Firm",1395446400,,152,3.935483870967742

8092541,1,B000BTJD7G,I was so disappointed. It looked like several workouts from the 80's were spliced together haphazardly & labeled from 2006!,1357516800,,123,5.2
8092542,4,B000BTJD7G,"I bought this BECAUSE it's from old Firm workouts.  The old ones are much tougher than the newer ones and, after doing this, I definitely feel it.  Yes, it is only really 2 different workouts with the third being a combined version of the other two.  I do the combined version when I do this one on the weekend and have more time.  I usually try to get that one in the day before my rest day because I NEED that rest day after doing the combined workout.  I agree with others that the makeup, hair, and workout clothes are kinda hard to look at, but it's easy to get past that.  I can see, too, that the packaging is a bit misleading, but it's understandable.  People who know the Firm know Allie, so it makes sense to put her picture on the front.  It's obviously not a recent photo of her, though, so that could have been a clue.  As for the equipment used in the video, instead of a barbell, I use my old Firm sculpting stick and, since I can't do all the ball stuff with my 8 pound weighted ball, I use my son's soccer ball.  One of the things I like about old Firm videos is that they usually had someone in there using things you can find around your house instead of the actual equipment.  I'd recommend this one to anyone who wants a good weight training workout.",1352678400,5,1271,4.168032786885246
