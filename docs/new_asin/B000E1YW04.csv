2483703,3,B000E1YW04,"""Rent"" is a thrilling, emotional experience on the stage: take it from someone who has seen the show on Broadway twice and in a primo road show version in Los Angeles starring Dougie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) three times.
But that was a number of years ago and though this Chris Columbus directed filmed version of ""Rent"" tries awfully hard to recapture the revolutionary feel of the new-to-Broadway-in-1994 subject matter (AIDS, drug addiction, etc.) and the re-writing and re-imagining of Puccini's ""La Boheme"" (by the super-talented Jonathan Larson)...it doesn't, though a couple of the scenes are knockouts: Mimi's (a dynamic, sultry, sexy Rosario Dawson) ""Out Tonight"" and the touching scene between Mimi and Roger (Adam Pascal) ""Light My Candle.""
Overall there is a nagging feeling of been there done that about this entire film though once again I must re-iterate: the songs are first rate at least and glorious at best plus all the performers do a bang-up job of singing, acting and dancing.
Unfortunately and frankly most of the performers are just too old for these parts: all of these actors were in the original Broadway production some 10 years ago. Remember this is a story about Gen X early twenty year olds and though they perform well: Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel (Mark, Roger, Angel and Maureen) look like what they are, mid-thirty year olds. More importantly though, an essentially young person's concerns, problems and manner of looking at life juxtaposed onto someone who appears well into his or her 30's makes the characters pathetic and hopeless rather than tragic and hopeful and this friction irreparably damages the film to it's core.
Sadly then, ""Rent"" is a disappointment: a case of a show with excellent bones whose body begs, really needs to be updated to transform it into as smartly cast, cogent, with-it, and profound as it was 10+ years ago.",1132876800,14,1919,5.037735849056604
2483704,3,B000E1YW04,"I'm a huge fan of Rent; I think it's the best American musical ever made and it's up there with the best in the world. I was lucky to see the original production in New York, and I've seen many other excellent national stage productions. I've been waiting ten years for the movie. What I got was a Hollywood version that was hit and miss. It's another great musical, like Phantom of the Opera, that I regretfully won't be adding to my movie collection.

Let me say what I liked first. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi, all of the original cast was there, and Dawson was fine. Some of the scenes were fantastic: the opening street scene with fires burning everywhere and the cast singing the frenetic and galvanizing title song; Mark and Joanne's tango of despair; Angel and Collins singing Santa Fe on the subway; Maureen's Over the Moon performance was a riot; the Mad Hatter's dinner at the Life Cafe was suitably bohemian.

Now what I didn't like. Even with the occasional brilliance of certain scenes, the story and the characters had little chemistry or edginess; it pales in comparison to the stage show. The music is sung and played to perfection, but studio musicians have taken away its soul. Many of the segues between scenes and songs are terrible; some of them are just blackouts. Dialogue that sounds good sung sounds stilted unsung. Some major songs are missing. Other songs have been changed, for example, Mimi's signature song, Out Tonight, is performed in a strip club, reminding me of Flashdance, and there was no moondust in her hair! In Angel and Collins' love song, I'll Cover You, you can almost hear the director shouting for them not to get too affectionate with each other, perhaps to keep a PG-13 rating. Benny looked uncomfortable in his role, and you'd never know he was a bohemian at heart turned yuppie who eventually finds his way back. If one more person had laughed hysterically over Maureen turning lesbian, I swear I would have screamed. And almost acting as a coup de grace was the elaborate and farcical commitment ceremony between Joanne and Maureen which included their breakup song Take Me or Leave Me.

Please see this movie, especially if you've never seen the stage show. But if the movie doesn't thrill you, please note that the stage production is a whole lot better, and try to see it if at all possible. And if the movie does thrill you, then see the stage show anyway - you'll like it even better!",1132790400,,2457,4.65668202764977
2483705,5,B000E1YW04,"I've had the privilege of seeing Rent on Broadway three

times with the original cast.  My family are Rent junkies.

We plan entire Christmas galas around the music of Rent.

We had high expectations and I'm very pleased to say

that we were not disappointed.  Chris Columbus did a very

good job at translating the musical to film.  Bringing

in all the original cast members with the exception of

Mimi is what made it work. Our old friends were back again.

And the new Mimi was wonderful. Even when the transition

from scene to scene was just a blank screen...it worked.

So go see Rent!  You won't be disappointed. And don't forget to see it on Broadway or on the road.",1132790400,6,675,4.471074380165289
2483706,5,B000E1YW04,"As a diehard Rent fan, I must admit I was very skeptical of the big-screen adaptation.  Since my first viewing of Rent, I have adapted the lyrics as my personal mantras, listened to the soundtrack weekly, and fully submerged myself into the sheer beauty of Rent.

I am very thrilled to confirm, however, that the movie was nothing less then spectacular, and, dare I say, better than the play?  The liberties that Chris Columbus took were minimal enough to not affect the mood of the play, and also add to the clarity of the story for those who haven't deeply studied and analyzed every single action, song, line, etc. in the play.

Any viewer will be enthralled for the two-ish hours (and the time does fly by), and I myself was deeply sad it was over.  I was ready to buy another ticket as I walked out of the theatre and go see it again, and I certainly plan on going back to see it again.  This play was great for my friends who had seen it once, seen it multiple times, and for those who have never seen it before.

It was wonderful from the beginning of Seasons of Love to the end of Finale.  It was amazing.  That's all I can say.",1132790400,5,1136,4.271028037383178
2483707,5,B000E1YW04,"Although I have never seen Rent on Broadway, I fell in love with the music online. I had to see the movie. It is beautiful and touching. It makes you smile, laugh, cry, and dance all in two hours. It has a deep meaning hiding in the beautiful music and wonderful acting. The camera shots are amazing, as are the vocals. Very well directed. Best picture nomination should be considered for this gorgeous film.",1132790400,3,408,4.527027027027027
2483708,5,B000E1YW04,"Most recent movie remakes either were horrible (Dukes of Hazzard) or indescribably horrible (Bewitched). People responsible for those adaptations were so blinded by a chance of their picture making money that they consequently forgot to craft a product which actually WOULD make money.

Fortunately, Christopher Columbus remembered when adapting Jonathan Larsen's 1996 hit musical RENT. Chronicling `a year in the life' of New York bohemians, RENT has previously been described as my generation's HAIR.

This musical-film also deals with angst, love, tragedy, paired with lots of sociopolitical commentary. A group of artists' wrestles with AIDS, activism, personal addictions, and the politics of a former friend/roommate who wants to gentrify the area after he wed the landlord's daughter. He is now the elitist which he had once railed against---and the others are still fighting.

I was ecstatic when I found out that my favorite musical was being adapted by the movies; then grew skeptical about the potential product's quality. I am elated to confirm that RENT is not among the `motion picture adaptation' causalities. It should become a `textbook example' of how GREAT movie adaptations are made.

Most of the original (as in THE ORIGIAL) Broadway cast reprised roles for the movie. Because these actors had already invested so much time into the parts, they naturally wanted to do a good job on screen. I never got the impression they were calling in the lines, and therefore was genuinely sad when the movie ended----only because the picture was now over. I hadn't gotten that involved into a movie since I was a little kid.

I particularly liked Anthony Rapp (Mark)'s acting and think that the character whom I act the most like is Maureen (Idina Menzel), the angry young activist lover of Joanne Jefferson (Tracie Thoms).

I (of course!) knew ALL of RENT's musical numbers by heart before going into the movie theater, but finally seeing it on-screen and generally unaltered was a delightful experience. Absence of the `message machine' breaks in this movie genuinely did not bother me. This screenplay did not attempt to add anything into the characters as `compensation' for theater modifications and therefore prevented its own candle from going out.

In another plus, it eschewed recent ""sitcom-Disneyfied"" portrayals of New York City to instead pointedly acknowledge cities as places where people are deal with life and death issues.",1132790400,6,2449,5.248081841432225
2483709,5,B000E1YW04,"Wow.  Having seen Rent 5 times, in three states and 2 different countries, I honestly didn't care if the movie was a religious follower of the play; I didn't care that some of the 'original' players were not along for the ride.  The stage version is my favorite musical of all time, and I've seen plenty of them.  Every time I've gone to see the show it's because I 'just want to see it one more time..' which inevitably leads to just one more, and just one more.

The movie is as magical as the show.  In a scant 2 hours and 15 minutes (the time flies by) the whole story is told.  Some of the details have changed, and die-hards have dissected those differences enough that I don't feel the need to recap them again here.  Suffice it to say, RENT captured a distinct time - the late 80's/early 90's and the AIDS epidemic at its most lethal - and the many different ways a group of friends dealt with the tragedy.  How amazing it is that even though AIDS is less of a death sentence today (at least in America) than it was at that time, the story is still as powerful and relevant as it was when Jonathan Larson wrote it back then.

If you truly loved the show, you won't nitpick the finer details of things that were changed; rather, you'll be grateful that it's been committed to film for good.  If you don't like musicals, you will likely not like this film.  But if you want to see a moving movie musical, it's hard to beat RENT.",1132704000,5,1434,4.235294117647059
2483710,5,B000E1YW04,"A movie that not only has great casting and plot but excellent soundtrack.  If you love the songs and the play you will love this movie.  If you haven't really been around either, my advise would be to go see this movie.  It was perfectly casted and transitioned well to big screen.  You will begin to get caught up in the story line from people that battle drug addictions, to love lost, to death, to friendship.  A must see for any movie fan who wants their money's worth!",1132704000,2,474,4.340909090909091
2483711,5,B000E1YW04,"""The Sound Of Music,"" while not my favorite Broadway show, is probably one of the best movie adaptations of a broadway musical...until now.  I admit, going into ""Rent"", I had high expectations and I was a little nervous.  However all of my expectations were surpassed by this incredible film.  That's right...this is a film in every aspect of the word.  The direction, cinematography, performances and script were all first rate.  Kudos to Mr. Columbus.  That's not to say that there aren't a few flaws, minor as they may be.  The film is set in 1989 and there is mention of the movie ""Thelma and Loiuse"" which had not been released yet.  Also, everything in the ""second act"" does seem kind of rushed, but the film being at 2 hours and fifteen minutes the audience does not feel cheated.  All in all this is a magnificent film, not just for musical theater geeks like myself, but also for anyone with a heart and the passion to dream and not let anyone take those dreams away.  Do yourself a favor this Christmas and pay your rent.",1132704000,4,1031,4.554347826086956
2483712,3,B000E1YW04,"If you have never seen Rent in any form, I urge you to see the play first.  The movie captures the spirit of Jonathan Larson but must dumb it down a lot to comply with FCC standards that gave them their PG13 rating.  Songs are lost (""Halloween,"" ""Contact,"" ""We're Okay,"" the end half of ""Good-bye Love"" (which, I might add, explains Mimi going to rehab) and most disappointingly ""Christmas Bells"") and others are turned into spoken word dialogue (""You Okay Honey,"" ""New Years Eve"").  In other songs, some of the characters are removed (such as Joanne in ""Rent"" and Angel in ""You'll See Boys"") in order not to confuse the audience.

The opening sequence of the film-from the cast standing on the stage at the Nederlander through the most expensive four minutes in a non-action film (the singing of ""Rent"")-sets the tone perfectly.  The quick cutting and loud rock edge introduces these characters the way the play does-with no holds barred as they toss flaming pieces of paper out the window.  The camera work is flawless here, as it is throughout the film, with high crane angles, sweeping jib motions, and the smooth pans of a steadicam.  It is perfect.

Unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't quite match that initial tone: suddenly ""New York"" became very colorful and bright-a bit too well-lit and jovial for a serious story about relationships and hard times falling on a group of friends.  While film was shot in 2:35 ratio to give the effect that you are still watching a stage performance (and thus you can see a great deal of the scenery around the characters), none of the subsequent scenes are as dark in texture or as high-energy (in terms of production value) as the opener.  They put everything into it and came out spent, taking a breather in ""You'll See Boys"" which pretty much holds two camera positions throughout the dialogue and song.  The pacing never found its flow: it jumped around and felt extremely rushed at the end as montage after montage was used to explain events that passed in the 525,600 minutes of these friends' lives.  For example, Mimi was only seen as a true addict throughout at the last few moments; up until then she just appeared like the majority of young New Yorkers in the art scene-a dabbler, an experimenter.

What was the most upsetting to me, though, was how the play was an ensemble cast, with Mark as a narrator throughout.  The film tried to duplicate that but fell short: by cutting solo songs for Joanne and Angel, they became secondary characters.  The balance was never retrieved.  I'm not quite sure what Christopher Columbus actually did with this film: the cast didn't need much coaching, as the majority of them originated in these roles, and those the characters were already theirs.  Each and every one of them gave an impeccable performance.  Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography (as always) was complex and beautiful and added to the vibrant world, especially in ""Life Support,"" when the camera took a 360 around the circle, always over the shoulder of one member to another and never once losing focus.  Only once did it distract from the moment: when Mimi has just come back from nearly ODing she and Roger are sharing a moment, and they are in the far left corner of the screen, leaving an evenly spaced Maureen and Joanne to fill the middle and right side of the screen, and leaving the eye to naturally be drawn to them, even though it is a clear moment for Mimi.  However, the fact that I can't find Chris Columbus in this film is not, by any means, a negative comment: he is no auteur, and if he tried to make too great a mark, he would have ruined the film.

Don't get me wrong, though: just because I am being critical does not mean I did not enjoy my time in the theatre.  I saw the film at 12:01 AM on November 23rd-the very first showing on the west coast, and I was surrounded by other true Rent fans.  We cheered, we clapped, we sang along, and we mooed with Maureen (as we should have).  I am perhaps overly critical of this film not just because I work in this industry but also because I had such high expectations for the film-being such a diehard fan (I saw the play on Broadway six times before I moved out of New York and once in LA since).  Jesse L Martin was especially endearing: he took Tom Collins to a new level and clearly had a lot of fun doing it.  The high moments of the film (other than the performances) were the almost ""Chicago's"" Roxanne moment in ""Tango Maureen,"" ""La Vie Boheme,"" (even though they took out parts of it) ""Take Me Or Leave Me,"" and ""Without Me.""

Rent will make you laugh, make you cry, and most importantly, make you feel for and relate to its main characters.  To some the subject matter is still controversial, but at the core is the most endearing and heartwarming story about true friends that I have ever seen.  Rent is a great film, but an incomparable play.  They should set up a three-camera shoot at the Nederlander and put that on DVD.",1132704000,3,4965,4.564825253664036

2483738,5,B000E1YW04,I switch between this and the broadway version. They are both amazing and are only a little different. This version does not have all the songs (but does have the main ones) and a couple of them are switched around most likely due to some songs being repeated throughout the broadway version that would not work for the movie. The story is the same and both make me cry uncontrollably. I first saw rent this way and wanted to see the play but never got a chance until the dvd came out. The story introduces us to 3 guys where there used to be 4 that live or squat in the same apartment. Everyone else is brought in through one or more of those guys and have their own story. The songs are all fantastic and contain a lot of heart. Its a rollercoaster that once you get off you look at the world a little differently.

(I think she did a nice job, and she is stunning on camera.) The movie came off as very clich, and didn't delve deep enough into the characters' mindsets. The music can't compare to other Broadway soundtracks like Les Mis, Cats, Miss Saigon, etc. whose melodies are timeless. I am all for celebrating the Bohemian, free-spirited soul, but this movie did not capture it. It just glamorized addiction and over-indulgence, and provided a shallow look at more serious issues. What I hated most of all is the jesting about animal cruelty. The characters find it amusing that Angel helped kill a poor dog for $1,000? Why is it that the characters groan about living in the margins of society and not getting respect, and here they are not respecting the life of a beautiful animal? I'd rather listen to Evita's barking than to their whining about the unfairness of paying rent.

This is an incoherent stew of underdeveloped ideas; these characters spend a year singing about how there's no tomorrow which only makes sense when you realize that there was also no yesterday when they met. There's actually quite a lot to explore there in the psychological effects of precariousness, but the script wants to romanticize it rather than explore it.

Not a fan. They also completely removed the ensemble pieces and most of the talk/sing dialogue. So all chorus numbers (but Life Support and Will I) were completely removed, or alluded to with spoken words and no song :(

2484026,5,B000E1YW04,"The Broadway hit brought to the big screen, and through Prime Video, to the small screen, too. The story based on ""La Vie Boheme"" rings just as true for New York City in 1989-90, although I was interested to learn that most of the movie was actually shot in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of the young actors who became stars from the stage versions of the musical have gone on to big roles in film and television, and also on Broadway once more. See it and remember a joyful time in your life!",1484006400,,496,4.231578947368421

Can't say how much I love this musical ... I did not see the play live yet... I saw the movie after it came out....  I just rewatched it last week and I think I cried more this time... ... Anything I don't like? The ""death of the Akita"" --- don't enjoy violence to animals even if implied and not part of reality, in fact that disturbs me quite a bit that one of the characters does this for money, but then we can't eat our morals can we? ...  as well as the ""la vie bohme"" song... alternate lifestyle is fine... I live one. I don't need to hate people who don't understand or don't want to live that... I especially am tired of the ""hating mom and dad"" theme...

How much more perfect of a gag gift idea could I have come up with!  I immediately thought of this movie, which I own and enjoy myself, and had to find it.  Turns out that Amazon is one of the few places that you can find it!  It was perfect!

When the gift arrived, it was perfectly sealed and ready for gifting!  When my sister opened it, it was in perfect condition!  She was super excited about not only the disc but the special features that came with it!  The case was in one piece and both discs were secured firmly in place.  While the movie has very few similarities to her situation (other than the struggle to pay rent), it's a fun movie to watch if you enjoy musicals!

2484106,2,B000E1YW04,"I really didn't mind the play but I didn't think it was bad, nor did I think it could be made into a good movie. And I was right, it didn't make a good movie.

The first thing you're really gonna notice is the lack of chemistry between the cast. It's odd because this is almost the exact same cast from the play. Rosario Dawson is the only actress and character I liked. That's because she's the most believable and most realistic out of them all. Everyone else comes off as generic characters and have nearly only one character trait.

The runtime isn't that long, so why was I begging for it to end? I think it's because there were 525,600 songs within this movie. The only good one was the opening song, everything else wasn't that great. They weren't all necessarily bad songs, but they weren't done properly thanks to the poor direction of Chris Columbas. Every song feels like it's going on forever and the only good songs end suddenly. It makes no sense why they have to all be so long. In other musicals, there would be dancing and other things to keep you entertained. Here though there's just people singing and barely moving. That's fine if that's what you like, but in a movie there's supposed to be excitement and awe overtheir singing and other things going on.

No character is developed, the story goes on forever, and the cast has terrible chemistry. I did like a few songs, but overall I was just begginifor them to stop singing. They're not bad actors and they can all sing really well, im so shocked that this movie didn't offer more and that this movie wasn't better. If you're a fan of the musical, you might love this movie. But I was a fan and I did not. Everyone else whose never heard of Rent and never saw the musical will probably pass out from boredom and hoping it ends soon.",1452038400,2,1805,4.414414414414415
