7346530,5,B012BYDKD6,Classic with an awesome extras menu. The Final Chapter with Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover has to be one of the best in the franchise. The Blu-Ray makes the movie even more awesome!,1448236800,,183,4.575757575757576

7346533,4,B012BYDKD6,"And here we find ourselves with yet another series of re-releases of the Friday the 13th franchise.

There are no versions of the feature films. There are no new special features. The contents of these discs is exactly identical to those that were included in the 2013 blu-ray box set that collected the Paramount franchise up to and including Freddy vs Jason and the 2009 remake. For those of you who own that now OOP set, there's nothing new to gain from buying these two disc sets.

The practical upshot of these is that if you don't own the complete set, you can pick and choose which films you'd rather have in relative comfort, and it also saves you the grief of the horrifying packaging that was inflicted upon the 2013 complete series box set (discs were damaged by the cardboard sleeve casing, as well as ill-placed dollops of packaging glue). Just be warned that your order may take some time to ship: I pre-ordered the Part V/Part VI set here at Amazon -- those are my favorite films in the series -- and it has yet to ship and is listed as temporarily out of stock. This in spite of my having placed the pre-oder back in July. It seems the sets are selling relative well, then.

If you haven't picked up the complete series box set, you could do a whole lot worse than to pick up all of the Blu-ray Double Feature Sets. They sell at a great price and you get all the content on the full set.",1441670400,4,1403,4.347328244274809
7346534,5,B012BYDKD6,"I had Horror Films beaten into my head at a very early age (mostly due to a unbalanced big brother) but, I grew up as a somewhat normal adult lol Compared to most any way
The FT13 Series is one of those Franchise i've seen countless times!
These two films wind down the so-called human Jason Trilogy
(FT13 part 2-4)

UPDATE: 10-30-2015 After a super long wait all the FT13 Blu Ray Double Features have arrived
For those still waiting be patient Parmount & WB dropped the ball on this release and the paying consumer pays for it!
I wanted to point out something a bit odd
The Friday the 13th  3-D & The Final chapter both are on there own Disc (So this set is a real deal 2 disc set)
Not sure why since part 3-D has very little in terms of special features maybe cause it has two version of Part 3 (The classic ""old school"" red&blue 3-D and a plain 2-D version)

The Blu-Ray version of FT13part3 is the same version we all already bought back when Paramount threw out the first 3 Friday Films on Blu Ray (2009)  this double feature also does Not include the 2 pairs of cardboard 3D Glasses the ""Original first print blu ray had
The biggest minus with this blu-ray is we don't get a Proper 3D HD Version (I would love to get a real 3-D version of this) I doubt I'm the only one
The Special Features are slim:
Fresh Cuts 3D Terror HD,
Legacy of the Mask HD,
Slasher Films: Going for the Jugular HD,
Lost Tales from Camp Blood part 3 HD,
Theatrical Trailer (cleaned-up in HD)
Steve Miner Directed this film but, yet he wouldn't do a audio commentary on this film
but, he would later do a audio commentary for Halloween H20 which makes no sense since the Friday the 13th Series made him a Legit name in Hollywood a complete jerk-off!
This BR should have always had more special features when you get down to it  at least a cast commentary Paramount dropped the ball on this so called Collector's Edition  (better then the Original bare bones) but, deserves so much more for the Legacy alone
it Introduce the Mask that changed everything in Horror up to that point

Friday the 13th part 3D
I Love FT13 part 3
mostly cause it's wacky and pretty much a screwball slasher flick
it takes place a day after FT13 part 2 but, there are very odd things going on!
You have the disco Theme (which i love and will always love)
kind of like FT13 part 5 (you also have these odd ball characters)
That have no point to be in the film but, to be killed off but, many of them are just stand out characters
you get Harold the local store owner who walks around his own store eating food
which i always got a kick out of that! also the dude has such a great face
Harold and his wife meet there maker thanks to Jason taking them out
we also get a new actor to play Jason
Richard Brooker (RIP)  who was a super tall dude I thought he was without a doubt the template for Jason with the Hockey Mask
he still to this day gets pushed to the side imo
The biggest misstep in this film is the whole back story
with  Chris  (Dana Kimmell)  being sexually assaulted  by Jason
2 years prior which in many ways makes no sense
Just because that's not Jason M.O.
even in a time line it's a little wonky
That's my Biggest problem with this film overall
That plot line is just silly
Tracie Savage  (Debbie) is awesome always liked her in this film
One thing funny about her character she was pregnant when she was killed (This would Never Ever be done today) in this day and age
you gotta give major props to Paramount and the MPAA for letting this slip by and not cutting this!

7346535,5,B012BYDKD6,"I 'm a big fan of the Friday the 13th films as well as the Halloween films, and Nightmare on elm st of course (R.I.P Wes craven)
the first blu-ray versions of the Friday the 13th films was packaged in a big Booklet with Sleeves that carried each Disc
this was Distributed by both Paramount & Warner bros, some fans like this packaging others didn't
i myself don't like the Digi-book style packaging, i prefer Blu-ray cases which easily fit on my blu-ray collection shelf
so i didn't waste my money buying it
but it really is Each to their own (personal preference)

so this time around only Paramount has now reissued all Friday the 13th films on blu-ray
with the exception of Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X which are owned by Warner bros
so only Friday the 13th 1-7 have been re-issued on blu-ray now
and each Disc is packaged in their own blu-ray case
all the special features and i mean all the extras from the old Deluxe edition dvd's have been carried over
the HD transfers & the sound quality are probably the same as the 2013 versions from the big Digi-book style packaging
so the only Difference is the packaging actually
Disc 1-2 have their own case own extras, Disc 3-4 (Friday the 13th 3 & 4) have their own case with their own extras
Disc 4-5 (Friday the 13th 4 & 5) have their own case with their own extras and so on...

so either stick with the 2013 Digi-book release or get these new Paramount re-issues
which will be available to buy on amazon.com from next Tuesday sept 8th, it's your Decision
i give 5 stars for each case based on all the special features have been carried over from the Deluxe edition dvd's
and also based on new packaging",1441065600,7,1659,4.383116883116883

8725891,5,B012BYDKD6,"When the ""horrifying"" black tin box set came out years ago, I was tempted to buy that, but every time I wanted to, it was either dinged or dented on the shelf. No way am I paying my hard earned money for that. It has to be perfect!
Well, Paramount got wise and rereleased the films on Blu-ray. First attempt was in the individual package. I have the first 3, alone.
Then, they stopped. The only way to get 4 again was in this ""double feature"" set, as Paramount released all 8 this way.
For some reason, this set is difficult to get a hold of as they seem to be ""Out Of Print"".
Still, it's a good set to have if you want 4 in HD without having the aforementioned box set.

~ PART 3 in 3D ~
Back in 1982, and in the '80s for the most part, 3 horror movies come to mind for this 3D effect, (Amityville 3D, Jaws 3D, Friday the 13th 3D).
If you can call it ""true 3D"". Sure, today's 3D is miles ahead of this. Still, for the time, the effects were passable, but not perfect by any means.
In some instances you can see the wires or props in this movie that helped it along with the ""effect"" of ""coming at you."" Unfortunately, when this movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray, somehow, the opening title credits from the part where Jason removes the machete from his shoulder all the way through the title sequence is not really 3D. The aspect ratio of the movie appears shorter on both sides until the end of the opening credits, than reverts back to normal widescreen ratio. I saw this in the Theater back in 1982 when it debuted. It was ALL 3D and perfect widescreen. If someone knows what happened when Paramount transferred this movie to DVD and Blu-ray, please let me know and the rest of the fans. I am very curious as to why this is the way it is.

I clearly enjoyed this edition into the series, no doubt about it. I liked it all, the music, the ""anger"", the ""feel sorry for me"" act, the gals were hot even. Oh, that Tracie Savage! Dana Kimmel, an actress already having parts in a Chuck Norris movie ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" and a part in the '80s sitcom ""The Facts of Life"". She plays the lead female or ""survivor"" in this one and is in perhaps one of the best scenes in a Friday movie, ever, the ""Axe in the Head of Jason"" scene at the end. Or, you could say that the actress on the other end of Jason's ""spear"" had a good scene, too.
Each movie in the series seemed to want to ""out due"" it's predecessor with the death scene and how ""inventive"" they could be.
Part 3 definitely has that going for them! I loved part 3, but the ""supposed"" mother of Jason coming up out of the lake at the end is a bit weird.
Were they trying to get a ""scare"" out of the audience thinking it was going to be a boy Jason? lol
I did find Richard Brooker playing Jason in this one well done. He did a great job, my fave Jason next to Kane Hodder from parts 7-10.
The picture looks good overall, but I think Paramount could have done better on the 3D for the Blu-ray release.
It did seem to me that when watching the Deluxe DVD Edition and then watching the Blu-ray Edition, there were some technical changes. Particularly in one scene where Jason shoots the spear at the gal standing in the lake. It seemed as the spear was getting close to the screen or ""viewer"", you could see a change versus the DVD. The Blu-ray was better.
** Special Features for 3 are ~
~ Fresh Cuts, 3D Terror HD
~ Legacy of the Mask HD
~ Slasher Films, Going for the Jugular HD
~ Lost Tales From Camp Blood, Part 3 HD
~ Original Theatrical Trailer HD
Harry Manfredini does the wonderful score on the picture
I would have loved to have had a TV spot or two and some Commentary on this movie by some cast members and perhaps the Director.
Cast member Larry Zerner talks about the movie in the early documentary of the Friday movies ""His Name Was Jason"" on DVD by Anchor Bay. I give this Blu-ray edition of the movie 4 1/2 stars clearly because of the title credits not being in 3D with the rest of the movie.
You get a white pair of Red/Blue 3D glasses in this set with text on the sides. I am not sure how this movie would look if you had a 3D TV and just merely upgraded it to 3D from the 2D version on this disc and used your own glasses. If anyone has tried this, let us know!
This is definitely in my top 4 of the series.

~ PART 4; THE FINAL CHAPTER ~
This looks fantastic in HD! Much better than any release beforehand, certainly. Paramount has been one of my favorite Blu-ray companies and most of the time, they have not disappointed me in my movies from the '80s and earlier.
This time, we pick up right at the night of Jason's ""death by hanging"". Jason is then taken to the local hospital morgue, where he basically ""wakes up"" from his seemingly dead status to wreak havoc on anyone there in his presence. An unsuspecting nurse basically gets gutted and a dopey doctor has his head nearly severed by a bone saw while watching ""Eroticize"". lol
Things get interesting from there as we head back to familiar territory, the infamous Lake in question, are you ""Crystal"" about that? lol
A small family lives in a large cabin and another one nearby gets ""rented"" by a bunch of doped up, sexed up, twenty somethings with nothing do to but dance and have sex anyway they can while there for the weekend.
Well, that's just a ripe recipe for Jason to come crash the party or should I say ""the door?"" lol
Windows shatter, bodies are thrown threw windows one after another, the dog goes missing after being ""thrown"" or did he jump on his own? Fido will never tell! lol The Sexy Twins end up being, well, dead sexy twins in the end. That gal that went skinny dipping at night in the lake never wishes she got on the dingy. She never read anything about Crystal Lake for God's sake? lol
If you thought Dana Kimmel from part 3 had the ""balls"" to drive an axe on Jason's head,. wait until you get a load of TINA with the Machete! Watch out!  Well, with all the dodging of Jason and down to the last two survivors, Tina and Tommy find a way to ""communicate"" with the serial killer with ""dire"" consequences. Is Jason down for the Count? Time will tell, but for now, we have THE FINAL CHAPTER in HD !!
