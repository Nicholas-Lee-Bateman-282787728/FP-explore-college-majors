4131237,5,B003JOY4F6,"As many other people have mentioned, this LOOKS and SOUNDS like a big budget film. Nice to watch a movie without SO many characters that you lose track of who is whom. Certainly not dialogue-intensive, but sometimes it's best to say more with fewer words and that concept works well here. I kept thinking I could figure out how this film would end, but I was still surprised.

Looking forward to the DVD release, especially if there are some nice extras!",1277769600,2,454,4.604938271604938
4131238,4,B003JOY4F6,"I loved this refreshing, visually stunning, old style, character-based sci fi. I was captivated by the cinematography, and completely engrossed by the characters. It's a must see for any sci fi lovers, and a masterpiece in low budget film making. A remarkable film on all accounts.",1276214400,15,281,5.130434782608695
4131239,4,B003JOY4F6,"Director Sandy Collora brings this simple, but well-realized tale of alien intrigue to another level by infusing it with the mood and flavor of 70's Sci-Fi. It has it's slow parts, but overall, an astonishing achievement considering the budget and the skeleton crew who crafted it. Collora's cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, and the unobtrusive digital effects help lend a uniquely stark feel to this often eerie film. For a first feature, this is an amazing piece of work, and one can only guess what Collora could do with a real budget.",1276041600,28,554,4.967741935483871
4131240,5,B003JOY4F6,"I saw this at a private screening a few months back. I really enjoyed the story and thought it was well done overall. I was fortunate enough to hear some of the behind-the-scenes making, which was very interesting. A great film for sci-fi fan or anyone looking for a great space action/drama!",1276041600,2,292,4.634615384615385
4131241,5,B003JOY4F6,"This movie brings back classic late-70s, early 80s SCI-FI.  It's a compelling story of survival with all the great monsters you'd expect from Sandy Collora.  The soundtrack is unbelievable, and really adds to the drama of the movie.  There are very few CG effects, and almost everything is done the classic way: live action, guys in suits, and miniatures for the ships.  In the age of mind numbing effects and CG run amok, it was nice to see real people doing real things.

I highly recommend this to anyone who likes classic SCI-FI.",1274659200,11,533,4.688172043010753
4131242,5,B003JOY4F6,"Big, big surprise. Found this late one night on YouTube. (of all places) Wasn't really expecting much but man, did it ever deliver. Every time you think you have it figured out, it goes in another direction. I especially liked the attention to detail - when someone was injured, they didn't make a miraculous recovery in the next scene - they stayed injured. At one point this guy is running from his pursuer and tumbles down an embankment dropping his rifle in the process. Now normally you'd expect him to pop up and continue on but instead his rifle stays up on the embankment and he has to scramble back up to retrieve it. He's hot, thirsty, injured and yet he has no choice but to climb back up and get his weapon and then stumble back down the hill again. I know, I know - it doesn't sound like a big moment but this kind of realism carries throughout the movie. Oh yeah - the dialogue between the alien and his computer is priceless. If you like science fiction, you're gonn' love this one. Me? I'm buying it right now.",1421712000,,1026,4.37696335078534

4131247,5,B003JOY4F6,"I originally found this on NetFlix (it has since disappeared from their library) and was delightfully surprised at how well done it was for its low budget. The story, while relatively simple, is entertaining with an interesting twist. You won't find stunningly amazing special effects here, nor highly fast paced action, like any other modern Sci-Fi movie (i.e. IronMan, Transformers, Avengers, etc.) It may feel slow at times, and it may even seem predictable in a couple places. I find it sad that these factors have come to dominate the determination of what is or is not a ""good"" movie, as I think this movie proves that with a good story and good acting, supposed ""detractors"" such as these don't mean squat! Sometimes, it feels good to slow down the pace and go back to the roots of a genera.

I won't be writing a synopsis here...I think you need to watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, without knowing what the movie is all about, how and when plot twists occur, or how it concludes. Great movie with a good classic Sci-Fi feel...if your a fan of that, you won't be disappointed!",1381795200,,1095,4.586734693877551

4131249,4,B003JOY4F6,"Great indie movie, especially considering the budget...had some really nice twists in it.  Some of the logistics were a bit unrealistic (how does one survive multiple days on a searing hot planet without water?) but it was easy enough to suspend disbelief.  I agree with commenters who said the dialogue could be hard to understand sometimes.  I was also a bit confused by the ending, and will have to go back and watch it again to see if I can pick up any clues along the way.  But all in all, a very enjoyable no-frills pure sci-fi movie.",1376870400,,540,4.479591836734694
4131250,5,B003JOY4F6,"There aren't many times I can say that with harlotwood churning out mostly garbage.  But I'm gonna tell you now--yes, get it cheap-- but get it all the same.

Those of you who like a little content and story rather than just the same old sluts and cussing and don't mind being slightly retro--get this one.

Don't expect War of the Planets type moral story...but do expect a 'real' story.  (if you don't have War of the Planets--get it now)

Anyway, this is a popcorn movie so I give it the big five star rating and place it in the top ten percent of popcorn movies worthy of the time/money/trouble of shooting.",1371772800,,611,4.419642857142857
4131251,3,B003JOY4F6,"It does offer SciFi action on a shoestring, which amateur antics are, unfortunately, showing in every protracted frame; I guess to expand the film to more than a trailer.
The making-of features are interesting as all involved gush to praise one another.

(That sounded cynical. I apologize. It really was an accomplishment. That's why I relented and tossed in another star. But it's really a hyped situation. Like the Academy Awards giving ARGO Best Film of 2012.

But it's an act of love and commitment to the genre which shows; a sincere
shot at making a movie. For that, two out of three stars seem appropriate.

so good it was funded and became a legit feature starring Robert Duval.

4131252,4,B003JOY4F6,"A prison ship breaks up in the atmosphere of an alien world and the remaining crew hunts the escaped prisoner. The plot twists and turns, flipping our sympathies and expectations along the way.

The characters get us involved and have nice arcs as the story progresses, giving us more and more information along the way about who they are and what has put them on this desert rock of a planet. The character work by the actors is great, making the most of the opportunities even through heavy prosthetics in some cases.

For fans of science fiction films the plot points can be a bit derivative causing the viewer to draw comparisons to many other films and tv shows but as a whole it presents a new take on those elements.  The costumes and design work are the same, baring similarities to what you've seen before and drawing on pop culture, but clearly not intending to knock off their predecessors.

This is the feature directorial debut from Sandy Collora (look up his amazing short film Batman: Dead End.)  For a first outing it's solid, though the pacing lags a bit at times.  Ultimately the real limiting factor on the film is the incredibly shoestring budget.  The limited CG is where this really shows, as the costumes, make-up and cinematography are all excellent. Collora's work brings a cohesive vision to the world he has created leaving me wanting more. I would have loved to see a fuller, richer world with more characters but the lacking budget serves to keep us focused on the few characters we do meet.

Overall this is a pretty good low budget sci-fi film, much better than you'd get from the typical made for cable movie and worth a look.  The DVD has some nice bonus features including a commentary and making of which are both worthwhile.",1365033600,2,1760,4.651612903225806

4131255,3,B003JOY4F6,"This movie had great promise but was spoiled for me by corny dialog and so so acting. The cinematography is great along with pretty decent CGI effects, however, the movie was more predictable in parts than I had hoped for. The ending was too abrupt and left many questions open. If the dialog wasn't so corny even the so so acting could've made this movie work. Overall, the premise was great and it's worth a watch, but because of the poor writing, corny dialog, and predictability, I would only give this movie a 3/5.",1351641600,,519,4.531914893617022
4131256,5,B003JOY4F6,"Who says they don't make entertaining B-movies anymore? Even with its modest budget you can tell everyone involved in the making of this movie put their heart and soul into the production. This flick may not win an Academy award, but it is an extremely entertaining low-budget sci-fi action flick. Those of us who grew up in the 70's and 80's watching late night low-budget movies on cable will especially appreciate this film. Good script, decent acting, interesting locales, and excellent use of costume design elevate this film to a higher level than it might have achieved in the hands of other film makers. Great way to spend an hour and a half and I hope to see a sequel to it someday soon.",1340323200,,696,4.620967741935484
4131257,3,B003JOY4F6,"Hunter Prey is one of those good, B sci-fi films you keep hoping you discover.  With B sci-fi movies the saying, ""you have to kiss a lot of toads before you find a prince"" really applies. Hunter Prey delivers. Using an interesting plot, keeping it simple, add a dash of mystery, making action scenes believable, getting the most from the actors is how you overcome a low budget and still achieve a good film.  This film looks like they were filming a pilot for a TV show, perhaps?  Too bad no network picked it up.",1338336000,,514,4.389473684210526
4131258,5,B003JOY4F6,"Just watched this on The Movie Channel today.  Was plesantly surprised.  This movie is low budget to say the least, but low budget does not equal crap.  A movie can have 200 million dollars thrown at it and be terrible, I talking to you 'Green Lantern'.  It can also have 3 million dollars threw at it and be great.  This is the case with 'Hunter Prey', evidence that big bucks does not equal big blockbuster.

This film contains great acting from the no-name actors.  They really put themselves into their roles and deliver believable performances.

Did I forget to mention the stellar special effects make-up!!!  This movie has some of the most convincing looking aliens I've ever seen, PERIOD!!!  All this mind you without the over used CG we are forced to watch these days.  This film falls back on what used to make movies awesome, great make up.  I applaud those who worked on this film, you are true artists.

Story wise, this is like 'Enemy Mine' with Dennis Quaid, except 'Hunter Prey' doesn't suck.  'Enemy Mine' did, the little bit of it I could stand to watch...

COSTS WAY TOO MUCH on Amazon, like I mentioned at the beginning of this review, this is on The Movie Channel on tv periodically, so set your DVR to record.

You will not be disappointed by giving this film a try, I promise.",1333238400,,1299,4.5344827586206895
4131259,3,B003JOY4F6,"This lightly budgeted ($425,000 estimated) Sci-Fi flick is better than it should have been given everything. Shows to go ya that a good flick doesn't need a huge budget to be pulled off.

Here's the scoop. A spaceship crashes on a desert planet and the alien rangers on board lose their prisoner whom they are supposed to make certain is delivered alive. A cat and mouse ensues as they try to recapture a prey who is determined to stay free.

This is a smart flick. They had little budget so they shot it in the American southwest and spent the dough on makeup, costumes, hardware and a few (very few) special effects. They kept the characters to a minimum and lensed it really well. This has a clean, sharp look to it and the shots were generally framed well. The matching shots/ continuity and editing were all pro level. The story is decent with one really big, fun surprise. There were a few concessions made to help the viewer. One being that the two species spoke the same language and used the same method for calculating celestial coordinates, but I suppose, given the budget, this was an efficient way to go. This is just a nifty little flick.

Had there been a few more dollars and a bit better script this could have been a real smash hit at the box office. It's not unlike ""Enemy Mine"" which was pretty big in its day. As it stands this is a movie that should be seen by fans of the genre, as well as up and coming film makers, on how to get a lot out of a little. It's more three and a half stars as opposed to the three I gave it. Crack open a brew and have at it.",1328486400,,1578,4.235880398671096

4131261,4,B003JOY4F6,"Just finished watching the movie on netflix and I enjoyed it for what it was, a low budget science fiction short story.  I would recommend this movie to a friend.

THE GOOD: The actors had there moments, where their performance alone brought you into the story.  I honestly enjoyed this movie alot more than some of this genre's more highly budeted movies, e.g; Tim Burton's 2001 remake of ""Planet of the Apes"", or Ang Lee's 2003 version of the ""Hulk"".  The look of the film was cool.  I found myself wondering if the film was meant to look retro sci-fi-ish, i.e., ""Battle Star Galactica"".  The actors keeping the helments on initally was unique.  I liked the Boba-Fett like look, and found myself analyzing the effort put into the ""aged"" look of the costumes.  The rubber or silicone masks and teeth looked good.

THE BAD: Unfortunately, the acting overshowed the dialogue at times.  The dialogue was very comic-bookish, e.g., the bickering between Commander Karza and Lieutenant Centauri. The repetative verbage here, is on par with comic book banter.  This is unforgiveable, good dialogue writting is one way a low budgeted movie can outshine a well financed one.  Good dialogue writting is based on experience or one's innate ablity to write, and is not handicapped by budget.  The acting was periodically forced, eg. Jericho's capture.  I didn't like the look of Commander Karza and Lieutenant Centauri's nose, oddly distracting, why did one have nares and not the other.

The surprising:  I am surprised by the polarity of opinions this movie has produced.  I didn't read any of the 5 star ratings b/c i am always skeptical of who is writting such overly-glowing reviews.  All other ratings had reviews very stong opinions either pro and con.  I did like one reviewer's comparision to a 70's like sci-fi feel, and the comment of how a thick chunk of metal was wielded about like a piece of cardboard, and a reviewer's wonder if this was a pilot for a T.V. show.  Is it me or doesn't the Centauri's computerized A.I. helper, sound alot like, Mass Effect 2's computerized A.I. helper ""EDI"".

I wish the movie had a little more creativity.  Perhaps a reddish hue to the planet, like in Total Recall, or more sound effects, like air pressure release while taking off a helmet.  Overall i did like the movie.",1325548800,,2309,4.789873417721519
4131262,3,B003JOY4F6,"When it first started, the initial cgi shot turned me off but once it got going I could tell it had a look that made it different than other low budget films I'd seen.  The quality of the suits and the use of the mauser ammo pouches kept me watching initially I suppose more than anything.  The use of helmets exclusively at the beginning was different since most movies don't do that sort of thing.  At the very least you see the actors faces.  The cinematography was really gorgeous.  Fantastic scenery made it look big budget.  I would say the thing that stood out the most was the acting by the 'fugitive' character and the last soldier.  The acting, especially on the part of Jericho was really pro and didn't come across like one of those cheap scifi channel b movie.  This was very enjoyable.  I would like to see what the director could do with a bigger budget.  The ending shot of the spaceship taking off was very good and far better than the opening shot at the beginning of the movie.  The planets in the sky were ok but didn't look polished enough.  You got the impression that the two main actors could really go places especially jericho.",1320278400,5,1153,4.438095238095238
4131263,5,B003JOY4F6,"This movie was quite a refreshing surprise.  Amazed at how great a movie this was with such a low budget.

I really really hope they make a sequel to continue this story.. Heck I wouldn't mind a pre-quel either to tell the story before this movie.  Fantastic story.

4131264,5,B003JOY4F6,"With low budget science fiction movies it is generally a gamble with the odds already set against you. I don't know what it is about science fiction that draws out the idiots who think they can make a quick buck slapping on some crappy sets on a mediocre script with lousy special effects when there are hundreds of other idiots doing that same thing. There is a glut in the market of these cheap films, and it's hard to tell which ones are worth your time. If you are a true blue rocked to the core sci-fi fan Hunter Prey is one of those worthwhile movies.

I strongly recommend going into this movie with no idea what it's about. But if you must have a synopsis here's the best I can do without revealing too much. A ship crashes and some soldiers are tasked to retrieve an extremely dangerous escaped prisoner. That's all you need to know. Trust me. You get the most out of it that way.

What I like about this film is how it deviates from your normal Sci-Fi in regards to how the story is layed out. Hunter Prey begins with putting you in the middle of a shootout with absolutely no idea what's going on. From there the story starts to unfold and you get more and more information on what's really going on. This sort of gradual reveal works really well with this plot. Especially when you get some intelligent dialog, good cinematography, and pacing that's slow enough to give you time to soak in all the atmosphere.

As this mystery unfolds the real reasons this movie shines start to come through. This movie rides on the writing for the main players. Character development is subtle yet extremely well done. You get to know them with just the little details, and it works. This development is so well done it becomes almost impossible to see them in concepts black and white, good guy and villain. I found myself rooting for both (often times at the same time) as the two main characters seem to shift roles from villain to hero depending on the scene. You learn to love them when you see them on their own, and when they collide the interplay is just as good. I don't think I have ever seen a movie (sci-fi or otherwise) pull this off so well.

If you need other shows to relate for me Hunter Prey most reminds me of Enemy Mine and the old Star Trek episode where Kirk is on a deserted planet in a fight to the death with the lizard-like Gorn (funny that I found somebody in the IMDB message board having the exact same thoughts). Enemy Mine in that you have two separate races that are on opposite sides and that Star Trek episode because of the survival skills both use as well as the wonderful desert backdrop. Granted this is a very different movie from both so take that for what you will.

I love sci-fi for the technology, and Hunter Prey has some really nifty tech. Sure the rifles are generic looking (they were actually tweaked Nerf toy guns), but everything else was really cool. The soldier's armor looks like something you would always see illustrated in a book or comic, but hardly see in real life. The tech behind the suits is even cooler with their little computers (voiced by Buck Rogers star Erin Gray) that monitor your vitals and administer medication as well as do things like scan your environment and communicate offworld. Their is also a pretty neat pistol that knocks you off of your feet (sonic weapon maybe?). There is an assortment of other cool techie things shown throughout the movie that are designed smart and give that added flavor to the film.

The acting is actually pretty good. Granted some characters are behind makeup, but if you ask me an actor who can emote behind all of that just using mostly your eyes is a good one. Some acting can get just a tiny bit over the top, but it never falls into melodrama. It was treat having Erin Gray voice the miniature computer. I didn't even recognize her she was so good. It took the end credits for me to realize it was her.

Special effects are truly impressive and subtle you get very few space scenes and what you get is good. The really cool special effects are in the background like the orbiting sun and planets that give what's your average dessert landscape just enough of that offworld touch to reall sell it. There is one spaceship you see at the end of the movie and when it's in space it looks cool, but when on planet you do see the limits of the computer generated animation. Still nothing worse than you see anywhere else. Actually it's pretty awesome when you consider the budget.

Hunter Prey was made on a shoestring budget at a good deal less than $500,000. And that's 2009 dollars. Most TV sitcoms have larger budgets than that. What they do with that budget is truly impressive. Even if you take into account there are very few actors and they are filming in one location, plus special effects are sparse and of course the Nerf props you still have a good show of what you can do on a tiny budget. Camera work is professional with a good eye on what to shoot. Everything was on location, which would mean a good deal extra expense just for going outside. Is it Oscar-worthy movie making? No. Not in the slightest. Which brings me to the movie's shortcomings.

Being uber-low budget means the script couldn't get enough editing to tweak away some descrepancies. As much as I loved the plot some things, even after you factor all the clever twists and get a solid conclusion that wraps up the big questions nicely, still either felt awkward or didn't make sense. Granted you get the same things from big budget movies (mostly the ones with small minds), however in this arena it only makes the movie feel that much more low budget. These limitations hurt what is otherwise a lean and well oiled machine of a story. Also the soundtrack is... well... I didn't hate it. However the synth tracks that try to sound orchestral don't hit the mark. Again... it's a shorcoming of a tiny budget so this isn't really a big deal. The music just doesn't stand out as a positive, but it does fulfill its purpose.

The DVD is a pretty good sendup for a microbudget movie. You get a 5.1 Dolby Digital and a stereo audio mix for sound and a nice widescreen presentation. What makes this a treat is the audio commentary by Director Sandy Collora, the mastermind behind the movie. His commentary is filled with interesting tidbits on the making of the film. There is also a half hour ""making of"" documentary with interviews with the rest of crew that show you the little tricks they do in making the movie look as good as it does.

What can I say? Hunter Prey is a surprisingly good low budget science fiction film. It delves into character development rarely seen anywhere else. The shortcomings are way outshined by an impressive finished product. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",1312156800,22,6780,4.486223662884927
4131265,5,B003JOY4F6,"I accidentally stumbled upon this film one late night on Showtime. I saw thirty seconds of it and was captivated by the look and feel of these ""BOBA FETTS"" roaming a barren wasteland. I couldn't turn it off, even though I'd missed the first fifteen minutes of it. Days later I still couldn't get this movie out of my head so I ordered the DVD from Amazon and watched it as soon as it came in. The next night I watched it again with the Director's commentary turned on. It was an awesome experience.

The look of the characters feel like they dropped out of STAR WARS, the pacing and landscapes and tight shots on the faces make it feel like Sergio Leone. It's such a simple concept. What's amazing is that the filmmakers put this together on a shoestring budget. You can tell there's a lot of love and passion that went into making this a reality.

The best compliment I can pay this movie is that I'm glad it came into my life. I wish I could buy the soundtrack and a copy of the script but... oh well. I'm looking forward to what Sandy and the crew do next. I'd love a HUNTER PREY 2 (as long as it doesn't suck)",1310947200,3,1113,4.196261682242991

Yes, is it a little slow in the beginning, of course.  But the filming style is excellent.  Did I like the ending, NO, but did I get it, yes.  It actually made me laugh.

4131268,2,B003JOY4F6,"I think the script had some greta low-budget promising sci-fi potential.  However, the movie could be done in 20 minutes with the script and character development as is.  And be equally entertaining.  I thought about turning it off a time or two as it did slow down immensely.  I kept with it just to see if it could improve...even in the slightest.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The directing was great, but it was dragged out at times to seem like a full length film.  The acting wasn't terrible and as others have said, the director did what they could.  In the end, as others have posted, it was very difficult to hear and/or understand 90% of the dialogue due to the ""helmets"".  Now, being sci-fi, they can have AI communicators, but can't get the clarity on their mics to function?  Quite frustrating.  Also, there's a great scene with another alien, but since there are no subtitles, the scene becomes immediately useless.  Maybe it would have helped to have a main character that the viewer could connect with a bit more.

I didn't give this a 1 because of the idea and the direction of the film.  The film itself...bantha fodder.  Don't waste your time or money.",1306972800,,1171,4.616504854368932
4131269,1,B003JOY4F6,"Pattern recognition is one measure of intelligence so, too slowly, I've discovered that the first sign of a cheap don't-care movie is a lack of subtitling. This became even more noticeable when the first 10 minutes consisted of two 'Predator"" rip-offs sitting, yes - just sitting,  in a typical cheap-to-film desert canyon scene and talking unintelligently and muffled through very fakey (Greek-Trojan like - yuck) plastic helmets with very fakey wear spoted (actually sandpaper scuffs were obvious) garish paint. Followed by really badly done and tiresomely ripped-off IR helmet views with nonsensical reticular displays that went up and down and sideways and in circles (supposedly radar like) like metronomes - pointless but a cheap way to create the warrior alien feel. The next laughable moment was when one of them cut 2"" thick metal plates from the side of the their downed spacecraft to fashion into shields that they swung around like a piece of cardboard. Duhh, dudes that's a hundred pounds of even the lightest metal. Usual fake painted, physically and gravitationally impossible, other large close planet in the sky. The rest of the entire movie consisted of the same tiresome desert canyon location with a couple of guys running around in circles shooting fake laser or sonic guns at each other backed up with a knife or two. A knife -  trusty weapon of the future.

Story is poorly written -  very disjointed with no background or character  development; and a rushed weak ending.

Props for the rubber masks -  not that bad.",1305849600,,1540,5.015686274509804
4131270,4,B003JOY4F6,"Hunter Prey is an awesome low-budget sci-fi flick with a time told plot with some interesting twists.

The story follows the crash of a star-craft carrying a prisoner back to an unknown alien world. Stranded and hard pressed to survive, three soldiers take chase on the desert world. Some of the story takes several surprising and interesting twists. Some of you, however, will guess and nail the plot, I did on several occasions. Much like older sci-fi flicks, there is no huge narrative at the beginning to give you back-story and you have to take things as they are....with little or no explanation. Character performances and unique set-pieces add to the believability. As the story slowly builds, The characters take on more shape. The movie ends, needlessly, on a cliffhanger.

The low-budget makes use of older and more simplified techniques in props, make-up and special effects. This does not only give the film a more realistic feel, but adds a strange grittiness to the world around the characters. CGI is used when absolutely needed and in good taste. The production design is brilliantly simplistic and effective.

Most Sci-fi films like these are hard to take seriously; Redicious plot or bad CGI monsters. However, Hunter Prey delivers something old in a new way that shows like a diamond in the rough. In a world populated by straight to DVD crap, this film takes the genre and it audience seriously. If your a science fiction fan, then there is no excuse for you not to watch Hunter Prey.",1303776000,,1505,4.87109375

Also, I didn't get why the quote from Darwin was shown at the beginning as it seemed to have no real bearing on the plot.  I didn't see that anybody particularly demonstrated survival by being adaptable rather than strong and intelligent.  I was expecting the prisoner to demonstrate some such thing.  Or somebody to.

I was so excited to see it was getting released on DVD and then last night I was even more excited to see that it was available for streaming on Netflix. The movie does not disappoint and is reminiscent of the 60's and 70's kind of sci-fi where it isn't about epic battles and monsters it is just a chase flick set against a barren wasteland with aliens. I would love to see more movies of this caliber get released. The film doesn't get to pretentious and doesn't go to ""out there"" in its depth. My only regret was not letting my nine year old watch, I think he would have enjoyed the film and the violence was minimal and no foul language; you don't see that very often any more.",1302652800,,780,4.172185430463577
4131274,1,B003JOY4F6,"This film's quality level is something you could expect from a film student learning his craft. The dialogue is awful, the acting is cringe worthy for the most part, and the movie drags on and on with scenes that didn't add anything. This is what you expect from a student that ignores his teacher's advice about learning the rules before deciding to break them. You have to know why they are rules before you can decide to ignore them, or you end up with unwatchable garbage.

Did he make this on a shoestring budget? Yes. Does he deserve praise just because of that? No. It's bad. It's actually worse than the horrible movies SyFy creates. I'm not sure why this has such a high rating here and on Netflix, but I'm guessing that it's friends and family of the filmmaker. (The same reason horrible, self-published books on Kindle get rated so high.) Do yourself a favor and steer clear.",1302307200,2,886,4.572327044025157
4131275,3,B003JOY4F6,"As another reviewer has noted, many of the reviews for this film seem planted (excessive ratings/praise with little substance). It's not bad, and worth seeing once if you're an SF fan, but otherwise of little consequence.
  The film is a sequel, of sorts, to Enemy Mine, the D. Quaid/L. Gossett film from 1985 (dir:W. Petersen). However, it is sufficiently detached that it's not necessary to know the previous film.
  This film is a well-paced chase across an alien landscape, but really only 'alien' by virtue of an orange moon in the sky. The alien environment-suits teeter on the edge of parody but, as with the moon trick, I have to admire how good the film looks given the obvious budget constraints. It's also a serious film, and reasonably intelligent, despite the corrupting influence of military SF (one of the more appalling cultural swings of recent time). It's probably not military enough to satisfy those fans, not hard S-F enough to satisfy those of us from that era, not complex enough for drama lovers, and not spectacular enough for action fans. I'm not sure who's left to hand in all these inflated 5-star reviews.
 Anyway, there are enough twists to keep one interested, and the film is no longer than it needs to be (an uncommon virtue these days). However, the dialogue is often unclear, and the resolution was as well, although that may have been a consequence of the former. I could have used closed captioning on several occasions.
 Although there is almost no plot, the actors did a good job of realizing their characters, the effects were good enough, the film was smart enough not to become a joke, and the whole package was an enjoyable 90 minutes, which I doubt I will ever want to repeat (enjoyable fluff is still fluff). I hope the director gets a shot with a larger budget and a much more sophisticated script.",1302048000,3,1844,4.746875
4131276,1,B003JOY4F6,"I'm stunned that so many reviewers thought this was a good movie.  There is no real plot.  The dialog is abysmal.  Most of the movie is a boring ""chase"" through a desert.  Watching paint dry is more exciting. The initial reversal of roles was predictable.  There is no ending, suggesting this was a pilot for a series that never happened (surprise, surprise).

OK, Alex, tell us what you really think!  This is the worst sort of shlock that fills the space that used to be call Sci Fi.  There are no Sci Fi elements to this movie.  There is no ""what if"" scenario, or even the stupidest kind (e.g. prehistoric/mutated monster on the rampage).  It is just props and costume.  Alien planet (desert with close orbiting moons, check).  Hardware (spaceship, guns, talking communicator, check), Aliens (rubber face mask, check).  This movie could be rewritten with minimal word changes to be set in any historical time.  Maybe it already was.  There is so little actual dialog that by comparison, Conan would seem to have verbal diarrhea.

I have no idea what the producers thought they were doing, but this is a real turkey. Watch something else.  Anything else.

[Note that I watched this movie on Netflix where I was suckered by the high ratings. (6 or the 27 reviewers had reviewed only this movie and given it 5 stars)]

[Be suspicious of many of the 5 star reviewers of this movie.  They have no other reviews suggesting that these are planted to raise the score of this very poor movie.  9 of the 24 reviews (as of 3/31/2011) are by reviewers who have only reviewed this movie and nothing else].",1301529600,6,1595,4.645161290322581
4131277,4,B003JOY4F6,"This flick is an amazingly well made throwback to the classic sci-fi films that made sci-fi films what they are today. But although it pays homage to its predecessors, it stands alone as a truly original masterpiece of story-telling, cinematography and direction. Considering this film was made basically out of the director's garage, from a budget that amounted to the life savings of members of the crew, it's astonishing what they were able to pull off - wonderful make-up and creature designs, believable special effects, highly detailed miniatures, and breathtaking cinematography shot on a top-notch camera. The less you know about the story of this movie the better, because there are several twists and turns in the well-crafted plot that will truly surprise you. The dialogue could have used a little work, particularly among the aliens - it seemed far too human - and the opening special effect shot could have been a little better. But DO NOT write this film off for those reasons! This is not a stupid sy-fy original movie or a B-grade DVD. This is a quality flick produced from a sheer passion for the material. It's just a shame that director Sandy Collora didn't have more money. I would have loved to see how his writing and direction could have blossomed under a bigger budget.",1300320000,,1294,4.886363636363637
4131278,4,B003JOY4F6,"Not much to say about Hunter-Prey.  It has a tight plot that moves briskly.  There are many turns that, for once for an indie movie, are organic and come about logically.  There is an awesome twist by minute 28 that you won't see coming  The dialogue is not quite sparse.  No lines are wasted.  There is even room for some philosophizing without the said dialogue seeming onerous or overly self-clever.  Some objections viewers might have:  there are only two or three actual characters throughout most of the film, four if you count the computer voice, Erin Gray (yes, THAT Gray from Buck Rogers!); the constant shots of desert brightness can wreak havoc on the eyes after awhile---but these are petty points.  Overall, the film was most excellent!",1299196800,,749,4.834645669291339

4131282,5,B003JOY4F6,"The debut feature film by Sandy Collora (Sandy who?) is simply, quite extraordinary. To learn more about Sandy, check out IMDB or Wikipedia. To learn how to make awesome science fiction films on a shoestring budget, and yet produce something that looks & feels like it cost countless millions, then just watch Hunter Prey. Collora is both producer & director, as well as one the actors in the film, and carries out some of the production roles as well. The result is one of the best science fiction films of 2009/2010, alongside Monsters & the earlier District 9. The storyline is simple; aliens are hunting human prey across a desolate sandy landscape. The aliens are reduced to one, & the hunt becomes a game of wits between the hunter & the hunted. But as the story unfolds, nothing is as it seems, and the viewer is drawn into one deception after another, sort of like a good mystery novel that has several twists in the tail. The actors are all unknowns, and yet all rise to the task superbly. The hardware used in the film looks more professional than that used in most sci-fi films of recent years, and the cinematography is simply outstanding. Collora keeps a tight rein on the film, to ensure the action doesn't sag, and the script is always concise & words not wasted, or unnecessary. The quality of this film makes a mockery of many of the recent big budget movies of this genre, and shows just what can be done by an artist like Collora. He presents us with an apocalyptic space adventure borne of precious little finances, & succeeds beyond belief.

8398386,5,B003JOY4F6,"Hunter prey is a shining example of how to make a good independent movie.  This film was made on a very small budget, but the directing is so good here that it's amazing what they were able to accomplish!  The story was very interesting.  The characters were all unique and interesting to watch.  The dynamic relationship between the human character and the alien character was interesting and very well written. In fact, it's one of the best I've seen in a while.  Both characters had good points and both had relatable perspectives on the story.  The make up effects were very well done.  This movie has great suspense and excellent cinematography.  The atmospher of the film is also great.  By the end of the movie, I wanted to see more of these characters and learn more about them.  The story actually ended up being very original and entertaining.  It starts off with a spaceship crashing on an unknown planet carrying some very dangerous cargo.  Turns out that the cargo that was being carried was ""the most dangerous organism in the universe"", and now the few space soldiers that are still alive must do all they can to fight off this creature while trying to figure out how they are going to get off of this planet.  Now that seem like a very generic story that I just described; one that's been done in dozens of other science fiction films.  But what makes this one so unique is how it's done.  We find out later in the film that the space soldiers are actually aliens from another planet and that the ""most dangerous organism on in the universe"" is actually the last human being alive.  So it's like a very generic science fiction story reversed.  Instead of the aliens being the deadly ones and the human soldiers having to fight them off, it's the human that's so deadly due to his cleverness and wit while the alien soldiers have to fight him off.  Seriously though, this movie is extremely well directed and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a science fiction movie with a good story or to anyone who is a fan of or supports independent movies.  I really hope that they make a sequel to this at some point because this movie to me was far more interesting than most of the generic stuff that big budget Hollywood films put out.  Sure, some of the effects are cheesy here and there, but the story and premise were very good and work real well.  I highly recommend this movie!",1471219200,,2401,4.524361948955916
