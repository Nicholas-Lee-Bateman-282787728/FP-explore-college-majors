8474823,5,B000EPUWT0,"It's in French. It's in Canadian French, too. There are puns, and language subtleties that mean that even if you know French but just basic French, you probably won't get it. It's a parody of The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful. Some will say that these show don't NEED a parody, but here's one anyway.

It's out of this world funny. Really. There's a real story, soap-like and nonsensical, but it's there. (""But didn't you die a year ago in the quicksands of Africa?"" ""No! I miraculously escaped death and I am here to reveal that your wife's baby is really..."") Even for people who have never seen more than a few seconds of a daytime soap (such as myself), the jokes and the story make sense.

The whole thing points out and exaggerates everything that doesn't make sense in daytime soaps. And there is a lot of it. From Identical twine played by the same actor (like the two sets of identical twins on  the cover art played by the two stars) to the completely contrived plotlines (""This thing I didn't remember thirty seconds ago but you just reminded me of is clearly something I've cared about for years and that I must fight to keep"") this series is soapier than the sitcom Soap or the movie Soapdish.

The two main actors are incredible and the supporting cast is talented and attractive. It's a shame that French TV has ignored this show so far. If you took five years of French and wondered what the point of it was, here's a opportunity to make it all worthwhile.",1196899200,3,1496,4.468864468864469
