8246546,5,B0012KHO6U,"This is a great, fun total body workout. I have never done any other P90X training, and am able to do this video with no problem. I add one pound weighted gloves to make it a bit more challenging, but it is a good challenge even without weighted gloves. Highly recommended for a fun workout that goes by quickly.",1379289600,,312,4.305084745762712
8246547,4,B0012KHO6U,"Kenpo Plus, just like regular P90X Kenpo, is a great workout if you have the proper equipment. Weighted gloves and a heavy punching bag turn these workouts from easy to intense. I too, thought these workouts were too easy but once I had somethoing to hit and with the added weight of the gloves ( I use 2 lb per hand gloves), these have become my favorite workouts. Don't be fooled, your arms will be spent when you use the gloves and the bag. I hear some people use ankle weights for the kicks. I haven't tried that yet but am looking forward to it.",1351728000,2,550,4.247619047619048
8246548,2,B0012KHO6U,"A rehash of the original P90X version. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I have done this twice and never pushed play with it since. If you can get it for cheap then maybe take a chance. Just my .02",1332547200,5,205,4.024390243902439
8246549,4,B0012KHO6U,"I love all things P90X, so I'm a bit biased.  P90X was a very effective program for me so I was excited when the P90X Plus series came out.  Kenpo Cardio Plus is one of my favorites from this series.

Why I love this workout:

**Tony and all his goofiness.  You either love or hate Tony.  I happen to love him.  His funny comments still make me laugh and they help get me through the workout.  You do have the option of just music or just cuing, so you can effectively `mute' Tony if he really bugs you.

**the gritty, gym-feel of the set fits the workout.

**the short, yet effective warm-up and cool down.  I hate long warm-ups and cool downs, I'd rather spend my time working out.

**it's tough!  It's about 30 minutes of non-stop cardio, not including the warm-up and cool-down.

**since it's cardio, it's easy to fit into a P90X rotation or any other strength training program.

Things to note about this workout:

**Tony doesn't mirror cue, so it can be confusing.  To mix things up, sometimes I alternate starting sides.

**the music is non-descript.  Music, even more than the instructor, is what inspires me to work harder and push myself during a workout.  This doesn't happen with this workout.  No matter, since I enjoy this workout so much, I can push myself anyway.

These things didn't detract from the workout for me, but they might be issues for some folks.

I recommend this workout to any P90X fans who want more intense cardio.",1280361600,3,1447,4.523255813953488
8246550,4,B0012KHO6U,"Kenpo X is probably a lot of P90xers' favorite workout.  It's my favorite anyway, because it is fun and not too strenuous.  A new Kenpo for the Plus series means another fun workout to add to the rotation.  Tony explains in the intro that Kenpo Cardio Plus ""was a must"" because Kenpo X was  ""more about positioning and punching and where your hands should be and positions of your body.""  This workout is ""burning and churning the entire time"" which, to me, is what I thought was lacking in Kenpo X.  It is not quite as challenging as I anticipated, but it is a more exuberant workout than Kenpo X.

Kenpo Cardio Plus is 41:30 total, which is about 20 minutes shorter than Kenpo X (all the Plus workouts are 40-45 minutes).  In these moves you transition a lot more quickly and go at them lickety split.  There is not the instructions with a lot of the moves because you should have done them before with Kenpo X.  You also move back and forth with the exercises and not one side at a time like with Kenpo X.  You move laterally more in this workout, so make sure you have enough room.  You also combine more moves which makes them more challenging.  The first exercises where you do the shuffles, I like to move forward and shuffle back each time.  New moves include ""The Gladiator.""  This exercise is tough.  You lift one knee up and kick with the other leg while in the air and then punch down towards the floor.  That move takes practice.  The ""Spinning Swords"" are difficult for me.  You throw swords (and later add back hammers) to the back while turning and looking to the back.  Those make me dizzy.  I don't look to the back when I do those moves.

The workout itself is only 32 minutes.  It does use the time more effectively than Kenpo X as it doesn't have the horse stance moves which seem kind of a waste.  You get breaks every five minutes (can we trade in some of those breaks for Interval X?).  It is not as fun as Kenpo X, but it is an Xellent addition to the P90x workout.",1257638400,15,1990,4.2991913746630726
8246551,1,B0012KHO6U,"KenpoX is one of the worst DVDs in the P90x series. I have P90x and I substitute The Pit Workout by John Hackleman.  Guys without martial arts experience should not should be allowed to teach with it.  Tony Horton does not know about martial arts.  Maybe his buddy Wesley does, but Tony doesn't and it shows.",1256428800,5,308,4.464285714285714
8246552,4,B0012KHO6U,"Not as difficult as I would hope it would have been... But it is fun and done uniquely and it's very lighthearted... not too choreographed, easy to follow and not horribley repetitive..  so it makes a good cardio day video when you really aren't up for too much cardio...",1238976000,8,271,4.530612244897959
