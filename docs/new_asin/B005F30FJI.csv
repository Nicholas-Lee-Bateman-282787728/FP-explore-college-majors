4670853,5,B005F30FJI,"This blu ray will only work on certain players here in the States.  I highly recommend viewing Matt Wilson's review for a list of compatible players.  I own a Samsung BD-C6800, and it works like a charm on that.  I know many people tend to use their Sony PS3's as their primary blu ray players, and i'd assume Sony locks out non-Region 1 blu ray's to protect their video game market(s) here.

As for the show itself.  Hilarious.  If you are a fan of dry/witty humor, then this is right up your alley.  Ricky Gervais & Stephen Merchant (creators of The Office) send their mutual friend, Mr. Karl Pilkington all over the world and we, the audience get to witness first-hand his encounters.  If you are unsure if this is something you'd enjoy, there are loads of videos on youtube you can browse to get a better understanding.  The discs aren't necessarily loaded with extras, you get some deleted scenes and what not.  One other minor bonus (to me, anyways) is the fact you're watching the 'practically' unedited version of this show on these blu ray discs.  The Science Channel version that airs in the States, tends to edit out every swear word.",1327363200,4,1145,4.5911330049261085

4670855,1,B005F30FJI,"We purchased as others did by ""pre-ordering"" the 2 season boxset. We received  it right after Christmas and disks will not play in our ""American"" (Sony) Blu-ray player. I chatted with Amazon right away (via chat on their website) and they were willing to refund my $ or send a new set. I requested a new set hoping it is just a bad set but was told if the new set still will not play, a refund will be allowed as the boxset states it is compatable with american Blu-ray systems.

THESE DISKS ARE NOT IN USA FORMAT!
meaning of you purchased a dvd player and set it to united states codec you will not be able to watch these discs on them. I even tried to watch them on my PS3 console and it still would not work.

4670862,1,B005F30FJI,"There was no need to put the traveler in  situations with so many problems created by the program and in very bad accomodations.  The point should be let him face the local conditions, typical food, habits and the way of life, with his total lack of culture.  That should be enough to make a very funny program.  The director is more stupid than the traveler, with his horrendous laughs.
I gave up watching this stupidity after seeing Egypt and Rio.
A good idea spoiled by a bad direction team.",1378598400,,494,4.51685393258427

I guess I should have researched this more because it does not work with my PS3 (and other devices according to all these reviews).

4670877,4,B005F30FJI,"This is imported from the UK, it clearly lists it as an import. It is also REGION FREE so there is no misrepresentation there.

Two scenarios in which this disc works in North America.

1) You will need a Blu-ray player that can play 1080i50 content and a TV that will display it. Most Insignia and Vizio TV's will display 1080i50 content. If you don't have a multisystem TV then you'll need option #2

2) You will need a Blu-ray player that can convert 1080i50 to 1080i60 on the fly, as all HDTV's sold in North America that have HDMI inputs will display 1080i60 content. All Samsung Blu-ray players convert 1080i50 > 1080i60 on the fly. All Insignia Blu-ray players will also do this. All Oppo Blu-ray players will do this.

There are no Sony or Panasonic players, including the PS3, that will play 1080i50 discs.

This is a good price for this hilarious set, but make sure you know whether you're set up in advance to play any discs listed as ""IMPORT"" when they have video content on them.",1352851200,2,992,4.488888888888889

4670881,2,B005F30FJI,"Whenever I'm feeling low or depressed, I pop one of these in and watch an episode. Cheers me right up.

BUT, this BD production is a disaster.

1) NO episode information ANYWHERE on the box or disc. You have to load up a disc to see which episodes are on it.
2) Finicky with all 3 of my BD players. Sometimes they load, sometimes they don't.
3) Biggest negative is that both series 2 discs have no closed captions (Series 1 does). This is not just for the hearing impaired, but the accent impaired. Karl says a lot of stuff quickly and under his breath. Without CC, a surprising amount of the humor is lost.
4) Virtually no extras except for a few out-takes.",1344384000,,658,4.298387096774194

I own an Insigna NS-WBRDVD (first model) and these popped right in and played beautifully.  As for the series itself, it is one of the most hilarious documentaries I have ever seen.  Karl makes me laugh out loud every episode.  I am so glad these were finally available in the US, in Blu-Ray, and as a complete series.  If you too are a fan of the show and have the right DVD player (see other reviews for more models), then go ahead and treat yourself.  I even bought mine used (just in case did not work) and the set I got was pristine.  Glad I saved the $20 or so dollars for ""Used - Like New.""",1335484800,3,704,4.287878787878788

While the bloom is off the rose, the edge not as sharp - there's really nothing like the phenomenon known as Karl Pilkington. Truly incomparable with any other human on our planet. And that's a good thing. At least, as long as you're a fan.

The guy does seem to possess an innate ability to get under the skin of some people - rubbing them wrong doesn't even begin to describe it. Don't even think to ask an Indian or Mainland Chinese expatriate what they think and/or feel about our man. Been involved in several unhappy discussions which consistently ends in a war of flaming posts.

The unappreciative aside, I think, as both Gervais and Merchant have already noted, there are many folks who can readily relate to Karl, his missives and misgivings. At the very least, he presents an alternative to the pompous globe-trekking narcissists that readily compare their ""life quotient"" to belittle you anytime the opportunity presents itself. Already played that game with several self-absorbed knuckleheads, and Karl gives a voice to those less inclined to dive into global flotsam, then proclaim it good 'just because'.

There's more than a bit of self-hate in what I hear and read in people who instantly brand the US and UK as somehow less informed, less self-aware and less spiritual - essentially culturally inferior. In all honesty, if I offered cow urine as a health drink, I can foresee about a dozen lawsuits before I even put labels onto the product. That's more than a bit of bias being dressed up as intolerance and slopped onto us so-called cultural Philistines.

And an excellent example of that is when Karl is 'volunteered' to do charity work in a South African shanty town made up of tens of thousands of huts. When he begins to question whether or not anything was really accomplished by fixing one, Steve begins lambasting and hammering the man. So when Karl asks a simple, but honest, question: ""When were you here?"" Nothing. Dead silence. Right, because there it is. That's the kind of self-possessed crap where the talkers (and there's an unending supply of those here in the states) are complaining and criticizing you, the guy who is actually boots on the ground, not having ever done it themselves.

Karl only says what's truthful - at least for himself. And I think people who don't like that truth, meaning not instantaneously falling lock-step with their views, brand others as socially defective and culturally bankrupt. I really wish people who so readily drop ""intolerant"" into a discussion look up the word and honestly stare into a mirror.

Stepping off soapbox. <g>

Idiot once again delivers. Karl's tormentors state at the get-go that there are a few ""goodies for us""; including swimming with 'dolphins' in Australia and 'watching whales' in Alaska. I won't even get into the choice between wing-walking on an old biplane or dancing at a very special club. <rofl!>

Ya gotta love the twists thrown into the boiling cauldron of Karl's ever-brewing unhappiness.

Personal Notes:

- The DVD Extras contains the entire televised home-shopping clip that Steve and Rickey watch in stunned amusement during the post-series interview as Karl hawks his Pilko Pump Pants. And, in fact, someone has set-up a preliminary commerce website. I know I'm ready with my credit card. Will pay even more if Karl gets to doing an autographed version. <laughing> :-D

- I'm personally embarrassed that the U.S. episode (Route 66) focused on some of the bizarre kooks of our country. We don't have long lines of people signing up for ""cuddle parties"". Nice normal average citizens far outnumber what's seen in the show.",1330214400,7,3643,4.924959216965743
