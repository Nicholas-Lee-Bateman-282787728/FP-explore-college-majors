4572268,5,B00556DZIS,"I bought this DVD at the Hermitage in June of 2012 $25 so your getting a great value.  There is no way you can spend one day and cover the entire museum.  The special exhibits like the Crown Jewels I did not get to see because the tour directors for buses and cruise ships buy them in advance leaving little if any chance to buy them the day you arrive.  I did get to see the gold exhibit which was quite extensive and beautiful.  This presentation is exquisite, the best of any museum video available.  I am still waiting for a Blu-ray for each of the major museums.  If anyone knows of a blu-ray for HDTVs that is a collection of masterpieces paintings/sculpture please let me know.

Go to the museum either when it opens to get a chance to buy the exhibit ticket or buy it days in advance.  If you go in mid-afternoon its not so crowded.  Fall thru Spring is the best and least crowded time to go.  Even though it was spring, there were tour guides taking large groups through the major attractions of the museum but they only spend a few minutes at each exhibit.  If you really want to relax and take your time go on your own. You may not get to see everything so plan what you want to see by watching this beautiful presentation. Enjoy!",1372896000,12,1241,4.260683760683761
4572269,5,B00556DZIS,"Although I have visited the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburgh many times, this was a really wonderful overview of one of the worlds's greatest museums and art collections -- as well as a summary history of how the collection evolved over 3 centuries.  This video is a really great way to gain an overview of the Hermitage collection as well as the history of the evolution of the museum buildings themselves.  Seeing this video will make most art lovers wish to jump on the next plane to St. Petersburg!",1371254400,10,505,4.662921348314606

4572271,5,B00556DZIS,"The documentary of ""The Hermitage. A Journey in Time and Space"" one of the largest museums in the world, is one of the the very best art DVDs that I have enjoyed recently.  In less than two hours a comprehensive description of the architecture of the museum and selected art pieces plus contemporary examples of classical music performed by the best musicians of Saint Peteresburg.  The history comments of the time when the arts were created adds a most valuable pespective. This DVD is a useful complement to a short visit to this magnificent museum.

Technically this DVD could be considered by itself as an art masterpiece by Vladimir Ptashchenko.  In comparison to other better than average DVDs, the background sound does not shadows the well informed descriptions by the presenter and the visuals are consistenly superior.  In my perception this program is food for the soul of the best class to be enjoyed many times.",1343088000,22,925,4.903846153846154

4572273,4,B00556DZIS,"I have been to The Hermitage so was aware of what I was to view.  I viewed the DVD with my husband who has not been there.  Both of us were glued to the screen for the whole DVD.  It is beautifully made and presented.  I loved the orchestra that is shown to be seated and playing throughout this video, it added much to it.  The narration was clear, interesting, and very informative.  There is so much to see in the Hermitage that only a small portion is able to be shown here. The mixture and variety of treasures/artifacts we see has something to please anyone who is a lover of arts and history.  I was thrilled with the footage on the famous peacock clock, the close ups, details and also the movement was perfect.  This clock is not wound for the general public to view the motion, so I felt so special to be able to see this amazing clock in action.",1419897600,,856,4.208588957055214

4572278,5,B00556DZIS,"A PERFECT ART JOURNEY!
I received my DVD this afternoon and I couldn't stop watching it since it has arrived. Almost two hours of great pleasure!
It is like a guided visit through the rich collection of the Hermitage. You can have a pretty good sight of the Museum building too. The images are astonishing and you can see them very closely, while you follow the clear description of each selected piece (jewlery, painting, sculpture).The DVD content brings lots of historical information from prehistoric times to the contemporary period. The doulby 2.0 sound is good.
I recommend this wonderful DVD to everybody, mainly to those who do not know much about history. They will learn a lot.",1405641600,3,688,4.888888888888889

4572281,4,B00556DZIS,"This is a nice overview of the Hermitage,  We have seen it and thought it worthy to lend to friends.  It is still not up to the quality of the 1994 PBS vhs version of the Hermitage.  I'm still searching for a newer version of that - or an up date of that.  The Hermitage is so crowded now that it is hard for people to see at the Hermitage what they want to see.  Though it may be different in the wintertime not many people feel up to braving the cold.  The last time I was at the Hermitage I could see very little because of the crowds of people.",1379808000,5,548,3.891891891891892
