8636094,5,B00HUTPJTQ,"I am always interested in history and this was news I had never heardKilling kings in a ritual. England and the Isles have always done their share of king disposal but not in a sacred manner. The DVD seemed short to me but then I guess there is just so much you can say on the subject. Certainly worth watching and exploring, delving more into the subject.",1423008000,,356,4.3283582089552235

8636097,3,B00HUTPJTQ,"Sadly, the bog investigated here had its skull destroyed by a piece of modern farming machinery.  Still, the corpse is important as it comes from the Bronze Age, rather than the later Iron Age.  In fact, the body predated King Tuts.  The narrator said the corpse may have come from around 4,000 BC.
I am not sure this documentary could be shown to younger audiences; I often say that documentaries that many may not watch in their leisure time could be very useful in a classroom setting.  At one point, a little boy reenacting ancient times holds up a grown mans severed head and cheers in victory.  Further, the work states that most people of the time were cremated and that these bog bodies were sacrificed and overkilled.  There is a lot of mentions of hangings, blunt force trauma, stabbings, inter alia.  The work never mentions Utzi (sp?) man.  However, I recall that the press was excited that a 5,000 year old corpse was found in the Alps and it was only years later that the press admitted that he was probably killed violently.  I applaud this documentary for being honest about gory details, and tacitly revealing that ancient Europeans also engaged in things that (post?)modern humans would find savage.
Often I feel that documentaries just repeat what older works already revealed.  I sometimes don't watch works on the Vikings or Ancient Egyptians for that reason.  However, this work revealed things I didn't know about bog bodies.  For example, acidic water is what turns the corpses skins brown.  One scientist speaks of bog trauma: he suggests the bog conditions distort bodies and not just the savagery of the killings.  This work presents the two bodies analyzed in Perfect Corpses.  The work shows dots on a map where bog bodies have been found.  We see dots in Ireland, Denmark, and Norway.  I really wanted to know why Britain was absent from this.  Does that mean ancient Brits don't have bog bodies or that they just haven't been discovered yet?  The narrator said ancient Romans never visited Ireland.  I am surprised because theres a Latin term for Ireland, Hibernia.  Didnt ancient Brits ever tell them, Theres an island west of us, yknow.
The programs brings up issues of class.  It states that most bog bodies were probably poor folk, but this example was different.  Unfortunately, their evidence came from bodies other than the one being focused upon here.  Thus, they make conclusions that I think were tentative.  Nevertheless, the discussion of fallen kings, and thus class downward mobility, is probably insightful.
As a small, final note: if you enjoy documentaries about Ireland because you like brogues, you don't hear them much here and only deep into the program.",1394755200,2,2706,4.881578947368421
