The disks were correct
I mean the disks were a little scratched but for 19 cents anything is good
great but seeing from the other reviews it looks like it might be a gamble

8518132,1,B007IXVX80,"I've ordered this not once but twice due to the low price and both times I did not receive Evangelion. As mentioned by a previous reviewer buying this is mostly a gamble, like one of those quarter machines that spits out a toy randomly. At least I ended up with an DVD of Chobits.",1436486400,9,280,4.203703703703703
8518133,1,B007IXVX80,"I've read the other reviews and thought ""It's only $.69, I'll take a gamble."" and that is a gamble i lost.
When it arrived i opened it to not only find a random volume of Inuyasha but a pirated one. It's not even worth sending back cause id have to pay more than what i got it for, but hey! I know someone really into Inuyasha so all and all $3 fpr a gag gift ain't that bad.

Don't buy it. You won't get what you want.

Too bad you can't give negative stars.",1424908800,9,459,3.872340425531915
