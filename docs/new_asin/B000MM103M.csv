8169995,5,B000MM103M,"This yoga and Pilates workout offers something for everyone, at any level of fitness and flexibility.  I have used it with my kids as well as my 80 year old mother!  Plus Melissa Stone isn't your typical emaciated instructor - she's juicy!  Great positive daily nourishment for body and soul!",1187740800,3,292,4.8
8169996,5,B000MM103M,"Groovy Goddess is a workout for ALL of you ... mind and body.  The tempo and timber of the DVD make you feel at ease, while doing something positive and healthy for yourself.  If you've been intimidated to try yoga practice, I recommend this video because you'll feel success after only one try ... then - YOU'RE HOOKED!  Whether you are trying to take off pounds or just toning up, Groovy Goddess will give you what you need to succeed.",1185926400,7,437,4.4375
8169997,5,B000MM103M,"I have been using the Groovy Goddess workout DVD for some time now now, and love it.  The DVD is filmed in a beautiful location--it looks like a bamboo forest--and the instructor's workout directions are clear, concise, yet delivered in the most soothing voice!  I actually fell into a wonderful, deep meditative trance in the relaxation part of this DVD.  I also like that the workout is ""doable"" for an absolute novice to yoga and Pilates (me)--but my friend, who is definitely not a beginner, found many things to like when she did this workout with me.  I have had other workout DVDs where I have had to just give up midway through--they were too difficult, or the instructor was too annoying in some way.  This one is ""just right!""",1177372800,6,736,4.630769230769231
8169998,5,B000MM103M,"I love this CD!  I've taken some yoga in the past and this CD makes it possible to rediscover some of the things I used to know.  But feeling out of shape and overweight is not reinforced in this CD.  The ""Groovy Goddess"" isn't some madcap looney, just a very relaxed and encouraging woman who tells you simply how to do the poses and exercises in a calm voice and the camera angles let you see what she's doing.  And she's not a super-skinny, flexible shrew who makes you feel like a ball of inflexible fat.  She seems like a real woman who is using yoga and pilates to look better and feel better.",1176076800,7,599,4.219298245614035
