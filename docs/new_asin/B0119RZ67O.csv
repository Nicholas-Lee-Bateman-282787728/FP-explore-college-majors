7331392,5,B0119RZ67O,"I never had a chance to watch this on T.V., but I did however see it on Google Play. I considerate this to be easily enjoyable and my favorite character was The Beast. You'd be surprised on how it ended (not gonna spoil it). In the future, I can't wait to have an actual DVD of this.",1437436800,2,283,3.982456140350877

7331394,5,B0119RZ67O,"One of the most unique, fun and beautiful cartoons to he on tv ever",1436659200,2,67,3.857142857142857
7331395,5,B0119RZ67O,"The first episode of this mini series opens up on two young boys walking alone in a wood, one trying to name a frog and the other simply walking. In a manner very similar to a dream, the older brother Wirt realizes that he has no idea where they are, while Greg seems unconcerned as he continues trying to name his frog.

Every single mystery in this story is weaved beautifully into the narrative in a way that feels as though it could save the modern cartoon. In a world where fairytales are constant remakes of the same story and the characters are the same (not going to name any names or ice princesses), OTGW is a refreshing and wonderful change. Music and animation are uniquely crafted along with mysterious and beautiful characters that create an amazing narrative that while at times a bit dark, show the importance of responsibility and moving forward over dwelling in the past.

McHale has created a wonderful world and story that appeals to all ages, no doubt the reason why the pre-orders have already sold out because it's captured the hearts of many people of all ages. I know personally I had avowed not to pay attention to anything from Cartoon Network after getting annoyed with a good deal of the garbage they'd put out lately, but Over the the Garden Wall deserves every praise and accolade.

Hopefully pre-orders will open up soon and I can comment as to the potential extras on the set, but as of now the story gets a five star rating!",1436659200,41,1458,4.557251908396947
7331396,5,B0119RZ67O,"One of the most hauntingly beautiful and emotionally charged animated mini-series I've ever seen.  Alternately moody, creepy, funny, and uplifting. The voice actors and music are pitch-perfect.  The animation and backgrounds are lovingly and painstakingly evocative.  Most importantly, this is a labor of love that took creator Patrick McHale almost 10 years from conception to finished product.  Kudos to Cartoon Network for supporting and finally releasing this masterwork on DVD (which promises special features and extra to be announced).",1436572800,10,542,5.822784810126582

7331398,5,B0119RZ67O,"One of the best animated shows around. Extremely compelling, occasionally terrifying, always amazing. The art style is wonderful and the show is both creepy and cute.

7331399,5,B0119RZ67O,"Over the Garden Wall is one of the most compelling things I've seen in recent years. It starts out innocently enough, with two lost brothers trying to find their way home, but you quickly find what kind of world they're lost in. Nothing is ever quite what you see it as, and everything from the artwork to the music has an air of nostalgia, and yet foreboding. The protagonists encounter many friends along their way but also many hardships, including eachother, in Over the Garden Wall.",1436572800,21,487,4.674418604651163

7331407,5,B0119RZ67O,"A little unsettling, a little weird, but beautiful to look at, and full of so much music! Each episode is about 11 minutes long, and self-contained, but also always part of the bigger story. I knew nothing about this before watching it (other than Elijah Wood voices a main character), and I'm so glad I went into it with fresh eyes.

It's completely charming, not too scary for little kids, but not too childish for adults, either. I'm nearly 30 and I love this little show. The disc is also packed with extras: behind the scenes, alternate title cards and cut scenes. Did I mention the music? There's so much of it! There's even an option to watch each episode with JUST the music on (I put on the subtitles, too).

My reason for buying this was that I needed to spend $9 more for free shipping, so I took a chance. This is probably the best $9 I've ever spent.",1518307200,3,863,4.354037267080745

Miniseries! An insant cult classic. Just google Over the garden wall and youll find tons of forums and fan art devoted to the world of OTGW. Anyone who loves Halloween will fall in love with this. I am deducting one star though for an apparant mastering defect; at the point in episode two Hard times at the huskin bee, when Enoch asks the boys How did you end up in our little town? the volume of the entire show is drastically reduced for About 4 seconds.

7331445,5,B0119RZ67O,"This is a miniseries of episodes that feel like they make up one single movie, and I could re-watch it over and over again. It's got beautiful music, and it feels like an old forgotten fairytale based film from the 80's, or it least it would without some of the protagonist's modern sense of humor.

But if you're reading this you likely know what Over the Garden Wall is.  This is a serviceable DVD with the original pilot, the option to play all with just the music, some deleted animatics, and creator commentary.  Unfortunately, the creator commentary isn't very good.  They aren't very lively or enthusiastic, and they mumble inaudibly a lot. Luckily there's a ""making of"" featurette that makes up for this somewhat.

If you love OTGW, you should support the creators by buying the DVD. CN needs to know that great shows like this make money too and not just Teen Titans Go.",1503360000,,879,4.645161290322581

This is an excellent show written by the writer of Adventure Time, it was bought so we could share it with friends and they loved it.
It is a tale of two brothers trying to get home from a magical and quirky forest called the Unknown. Both are much like real people I know, especially Greg.
I don't want to spoil it if you are thinking of buying this and haven't seen it. It is a real treat and I hope more cartoons like this would be made.",1503187200,2,601,4.181034482758621

I am disappointed because when someone orders a new product, they expect it to arrive in a good condition. This was not the case.

The voice actors are all legends and kill their performances, especially Elijah Wood. I love the heart and soul of the main storyline. There are many laughs for any child to enjoy, while their parents will be able to appreciate the deep narrative, emotional sequences, and more intelligent references. I think everyone should see Over the Garden Wall at least once. Perfect for The Fall or around Halloween. It's cute and dark, nostalgic and modern, brilliant and wondrous! It's too bad there are no Blu-rays of this series, but the DVD looks great, has some extras, all the episodes without commercials. Experiencing it this way is ideal as Over the Garden Wall functions more like a short animated indie film instead of a children's cartoon.

7331489,3,B0119RZ67O,"This is a sub-par transfer. Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, & 8 all have a serious black level deficiency, leading to a very washed out look. Episodes 6, 7, 9, 10 don't have this issue and look excellent by comparison. Honestly, the iTunes version is much more consistent in terms of picture quality, and for my tastes, preferrable to even the episodes not affected by the washed out black levels on this Blu-ray. HOWEVER, there is music missing from the iTunes version that has a pretty detrimental effect. I haven't checked every episode, but the US iTunes version of episode 9 is missing pretty much the entire soundtrack, which is preserved here on the international Blu-ray. It's pretty unfortunate, because the lack of the soundtrack in episode 9 really hurts the episode, and otherwise, I would wholeheartedly recommend the iTunes version as the superior choice over this Blu-ray. As it stands, neither release is particularly recommendable, given the shortcomings of both. So at this time, to access the definitive experience of the amazing Over the Garden Wall, you have a few choices: somehow acquire a non-US iTunes release, which appears to have all the music intact, or get the US iTunes version along with this Blu-ray and watch episodes 1-5 & 8 via iTunes and episodes 6, 7, 9, 10 via the Blu-ray. Or forego the HD experience and take a chance on the SD DVD version, assuming it has all the music intact and consistent black levels (which I haven't confirmed either way).

Here's hoping we'll someday get a definitive US Blu-ray release unaffected by the washed out black levels or missing music issues.

UPDATE: I just discovered that the US iTunes versions DOES in fact have the complete soundtrack, but limited to the 2 channel stereo audio. For whatever reason, they messed up the 5.1 audio mix and left some music out. So, at this time, my recommendation for the best viewing experience is to buy the US iTunes vesion for ten bucks, watch it with the 2 channel stereo audio track selected, and skip importing this pricey, inferior Blu-ray release.",1482710400,11,2059,4.813559322033898

It's not a musical show, but the songs are frequent and always do a fantastic job of establishing the ""feel"" of Over the Garden Wall.

The DVD is well put together and is a great value for the $10 you're paying for it.

7331526,5,B0119RZ67O,"I think I can safely say that I have never seen anything quite like ""Over the Garden Wall"" before.  I had seen fanart of it floating around online, and had it recommended to me by various friends, but I knew little about it other than it was about two brothers lost in the woods.  The fact that it was created by one of the creators of ""The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack"" and ""Adventure Time,"" two shows I find too wacky for my tastes, made me somewhat hesitant, but despite leaning toward the strange end of the spectrum, ""Over the Garden Wall"" is almost nothing like those shows.  In fact, I'd daresay it's an animated masterpiece, and destined to become a classic.

""Over the Garden Wall"" follows two half-brothers -- cynical and cowardly older brother Wirt, and optimistic and silly Greg -- as they traverse a stretch of woods simply called The Unknown in an attempt to find their way home.  Accompanied by a talking bluebird named Beatrice, who may know a way to get the boys home, they come across many of the strange denizens of the forest -- a crazy tea tycoon whose mansion may or may not be haunted, a school for animals taught by a lovelorn teacher, a village where the inhabitants wear pumpkin-and-corn costumes for a shocking reason, and a riverboat full of sophisticated frogs.  In their travels they find themselves stalked by a cryptic woodsman bearing a mysterious lantern... and a sinister entity known as the Beast, who seeks out the boys for his own dark purposes...

The animation in this miniseries is quite good -- not Disney or Miyazaki levels, but very smooth and a step above many Cartoon Network shows.  The style tends to make all humans look like animated dolls, but I find this adds to the charm of the special, and keeps the character designs from falling into the uncanny valley.  The cartoon is very atmospheric, with lush backgrounds and plenty of nods to old-time cartoons that will please animation buffs without alienating younger viewers.

The voicework and music are both superb -- I lump these together because many of the voice actors are also singers, and lend their voices well to both the spoken word and the series's songs.  Many big-name stars lend their voices to the characters, including Elijah Woods as Wirt, Christopher Lloyd as the woodsman, and John Cleese, Tim Curry, and even rock musician Chris Isaak in the roles of secondary characters.  The songs are all quite delightful to listen to as well, and it makes me wish that Cartoon Network would release a soundtrack of the series.

The story seems simple at first glance, but has several layers to it that will keep viewers watching and even re-watching to look for clues and hints.  And despite the cutesy looks of the characters and the fairy-tale feeling of the entire special, it gets dark at times, and can even be scary for very young viewers.  But all this makes for a richer viewing experience, and turns a simple ""lost in the woods"" tale into something with deeper meaning.  Some of this meaning is left up to the viewer to interpret, but that's all for the good in my opinion.

SPOILER:  There is a twist toward the end of the min-series that I'm still trying to make up my mind about.  I'm not sure how well I like it, to be honest.  But it doesn't bother me enough that it spoils the journey for me.

I heartily recommend this series for almost any viewer -- kids will love the strange but fantastic adventure (though very little ones might be scared by the Beast and by some other elements), animation buffs will love the excellent animation and the nods to classic cartoons, and even adult viewers can appreciate a well-told tale that's more than meets the eye at first glance.  If you like the films of Miyazaki, you'll probably enjoy ""Over the Garden Wall"" -- the animation is very different, but the general feel of the film is very similar.  I daresay this is one of the best cartoons I've seen in a long time, and I'd gladly watch it again.",1472688000,2,3971,4.6253561253561255

7331547,5,B0119RZ67O,"For the uninitiated, Over the Garden Wall is a short series that ran on Cartoon Network following Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice - three kids (okay, two kids and a bird) trying to escape a strange world they ended up in. The entire show's runtime is a little over 2 hours, making it about the length of a theater movie. The DVD contains the entire OtGW miniseries which consists of several episodes that are 11-or-so minutes long.

I thought the eps and characters were cute and fun and the voices were well-cast. The design of the show and world are phenomenal, down to every last detail. The soundtrack also fit the show well. Just to clarify, I'm an adult cartoonist so that's the reference point I'm reviewing this from - but I'm confident kids will enjoy the show like I did C:

The show's visual style wasn't my cup of tea personally - I felt like I was in the fall decor section of a Hobby Lobby while watching - but I definitely appreciate it for what it is and still enjoyed watching. If you're unsure about getting it but love and appreciate cartoons and animation, I'd say go for it!  It's inexpensive and only a few hours long.",1464134400,,1133,4.4375
7331548,5,B0119RZ67O,"Buy this! If you're thinking about it, just do it!

A welcome addition to any animation collection, this series has a dark fantasy vibe with a good heart. Gleaning inspiration from the classics like animations by Ub Iwerks and borrowing style from ""Betty Boop"" all with a modern twist, along with music that is both nostalgic and hauntingly new, this show will take you on an adventure unlike anything seen before. Take nothing for granted as you follow Wirt and his brother Greg through The Unknown.

About the DVD, this is a miniseries where every episode is somewhere from 10-15 minutes long, making the entire thing about the length of a movie. Each episode takes you further into their world, but don't worry - there isn't missing footage between episodes. (Though, they are going to be releasing a comic series that will cover what's between the lines, but that's not out yet.) So for now, just go along with it.

Bonus Material: The audio commentary is ok, you get to hear some of what the creators went through as they made the series, but don't expect them to share any deep secrets about the meaning of the show. They want you to come up with your own interpretation, I'm sure. (Though it seems like they themselves are not convinced of a single meaning.) The music track, on the other hand, is a must listen. It allows you to hear full length versions of the soundtrack and is a complete joy.",1462838400,8,1403,4.604

7331570,5,B0119RZ67O,"What a beautiful and charming mini-series. When I started watching this, I was so enthralled I basically binged the entire series within only a couple of days. (Not a difficult feat, but since I work a lot, I wasn't able to just sit down and watch the whole thing at one time.) I really cant speak more highly of this series: the music is fantastic, the animation is eerie and beautiful, and the storyline itself has a whimsically sad innocence to it that I find absolutely enchanting. (FYI, as I write this review, you can watch the entire series on Hulu.)

Though the main characters are kids, this show has some decidedly adult themes dealing with enslavement, deceit, and even death. There are of course some silly and odd things that occur, as well, to balance out the darkness. Some voices should be familiar to you, namely Elijah Wood and Christopher Lloyd. It honestly took me a minute to get used to Elijah Wood voicing the character, since I just came from watching Wilfred and thats all I could think about while watching this series and hearing his voice.

Some really odd things happen to these two boys on their adventure of getting home, but that makes the series all the more compelling. With so many shoes repeating the typical TV formula, it was nice to have surprises while watching this. Granted, a few important plot points were easy to guess, but the adventure to reach those assumptions introduced enough mystery to keep me watching. As someone who is a huge fan of darker and sadder shows and books, this show had enough of that to keep me feeling those feels, too.",1458518400,,1589,4.631205673758865

7331576,5,B0119RZ67O,"A little bit more slow paced than most cartoons that I've seen produced these days, but in a good way. It's not just a time filler (though each ""episode"" is only about fifteen minutes) nor something to put on for background noise, you'll want to really pay attention -  the story starts off with the episodes noticeably linear but somewhat disjointed then progressively brings several seemingly unrelated events and themes together.
The character design is definitely weird, I almost might have passed up on it just for that reason. But it's animated and acted smoothly, and the story makes it worth the watch.",1456876800,,610,4.922330097087379

7331585,5,B0119RZ67O,"When I first heard about this cartoon, I was under the impression that it was going to be a regular TV series. So I was surprised to find out that it was actually a mini-series; a weekly event consisting of just ten, eleven minute shorts. But for various reasons, I was unable to watch it when it first aired on TV, and considering the heavy fairy tale aspect to it (a genre I don't usually dip into much--I'm more sci-fi oriented), I promptly forgot about it. But soon enough, dozens of blogs were raving about the series; praising its characters and animation, to the point I found people cosplaying as the characters at comic conventions. Now interested to see just what the commotion was about, I finally recently sat down and marathoned all ten episodes (amounting to a feature length movie).

What I saw blew me away. If Cartoon Network continues to produce content of such quality, it's on the fast track to becoming the great channel it once was again.

Two brothers--teenage Wirt and young Greg, find themselves lost in a strange forest, sometime during the 18 to early 1900's, with little to no memory of how they got there. On their quest to find their way back home, they come across a wide assortment of strange people and creatures, including an irritated bluebird named Beatrice (who claims she can help them return home), a talking horse named Fred (with a pendant for stealing stuff), as well as other seemingly scary folk who turn out to not be so frightening when one gets to know them. But when certain characters turn out to not be so friendly, and with an evil beast stalking the boys at every turn, will the brothers find a way back to where they came from?

I was very surprised to discover the high profile voice talent brought aboard to bring the characters to life, including Elijah Wood, Christopher Lloyd, John Cleese, and Tim Curry, among others. Everyone fits the roles perfectly of these various characters that, for how magical and weird they can get, are also very relatable. Greg is especially adorable; keeping a constant upbeat and positive attitude, and while his actions sometimes accidentally land him and his brother into trouble, consequently, he often saves them both as well. And while he speaks with all the innocence of a child, much of what he says is very wise advice. It's through him that causes Wirt to see the most development; starting off extremely shy and nervous, and content to follow what others tell him. But by journey's end, he learns to not only have more self confidence, but to be more responsible in taking care of his brother. And consequently, he and his sibling's actions affect the residents in ways they never imagined.

All ten episodes have movie quality scenery and animation, like something out of a Miyazaki film. With its folksy music, imaginative creature designs, and autumn color pallet, each little story evokes the feeling of reading a fairy tale book (even each installment is called a ""chapter"", rather than an ""episode""). And while all ten stories form one long narrative, they also each teach a moral or lesson, ranging from being honest, to finding true love, to owning up to your mistakes. And the ending, which I dare not give away, has a Twilight Zone-ish twist that leaves the reality of the events up to the viewer. But however you interpret the conclusion, the boys' journey into The Unknown is for a reason, with heavy layers of symbolism strewn throughout that will become more clear on repeated viewings.

(For the curious, my personal favorite episode was Chapter 2: ""Hard Times at the Huskin Bee"". It starts off effectively creepy, but then hits the viewer with a surprising and rather funny twist.)

Simply put, this is an amazing mini-series that has all the makings of a modern day fairy tale. If any sort of official movie adaption, book, or sequel comes out of this, I'll be sure to check it out.",1455667200,,3898,4.733431516936672

Greg is one of the greatest characters in the history of the medium, and the running gag of Greg re-naming his frog is one of the greatest things of all time.

It also features a fantastic cast, with many unecpected cameos along the way. While the show is light-hearted, that doesn't mean it doesn't deal with serious ideas or have dark imagery (there is plenty, I assure you) but it never goes too far as to make children upset, instead treating them intelligently.

7331683,4,B0119RZ67O,"I wanted to watch this because Patrick McHale, the creator, is a former writer and creative director on the animated Cartoon Network series Adventure Time, which is near and dear to my (totally grown and childless) heart. That said, you won't find anything as frikkin' cute as the stuff that pops up regularly on AT in this miniseries (I have a soft spot for fishes with little feet in business wear, amorphous dogs, and candy people), but once I got over that, I enjoyed it. The little brother, Greg, can be kind of annoying, but he's a little brother after all. I Do Not Get the teapot, but it didn't really bother me. Christopher Lloyd (!!!) is a welcome addition to the cast, and I can definitely say that the mood of the piece is excellent - a bit spooky, with a dreamlike quality and some sinister moments that are nicely tempered with humor and innocence. I loved the backgrounds. They reminded me of the Topcraft (Studio-Ghibli precursor)-produced 1977 animated Hobbit, with their dreamy rack focus quality. Anyone familiar with Adventure Time will also know that there are going to be meanings upon meanings hidden all over something conceived by McHale, so this isn't really a casual watch, in that you'll want to really pay attention to the plotting. Many of the episodes are rooted in folktales and childrens stories from the 19th and early 20th centuries, and inspired by myths and old wives' tales that have been passed down throughout the years. The music is also quite old-timey - if you have any affection for folksy early twentieth century music, you won't be disappointed. I gave this four out of five because it is a strange little romp, and I took some time to warm to it, but I will say that I only give five stars to something that Changed My Life and unless that's Princess Mononoke you are gonna have a hard time pleasing me. Regardless, if you appreciate artisanal animation and quirky twenty first century cartoons, you will enjoy it.",1446163200,,1961,4.703488372093023

7331707,4,B0119RZ67O,"Think of this hit miniseries as your answer to ""What if Hayo Miyazaki was the creator of 'Adventure Time'?""  Well, at least that's what I thought considering the design ethic of that series.  ""Over the Garden Wall"" chronicles the adventures of two brothers as they enter a mysterious forest and encounter all kinds of bizarre creatures that live within that forest; most are friendly, while others aren't.  But no matter what the challenge, Wirt (the brother with the gnome-like hat) and Greg (the brother with a teapot on his head) along with a few animal friends like Beatrice the bird and Greg's pet frog will find their way home as they venture into what is known as The Unknown.

With plenty of original songs and celebrity voice talent from Elijah Wood (""Happy Feet"") to Christopher Lloyd (""Back to the Future""), you'd find this 10-part mini series interesting to watch.  Also on this DVD you'll find lots of extras like commentaries, animatics, alternate title cards, and the original pilot episode entitled ""Tome of the Unknown"".  So if you're looking for something mysterious and musical, then you should give this series a try.

7331715,5,B0119RZ67O,"There are simply no words to express how great, well told, engrossing; just altogether perfect this little 10-part (each part about 15 minutes) series is.  It's enjoyable for kids, and even more so for adults (the scarier and more macabre scenes will fly right by children, while leaving you wondering how they just got away with it.)

There are two things that concern me, though. 1.) This may be edited for content.  On TV, the rating ws TV-PG for the most part; but then during more intense scenes the rating TV-14 would pop up, going as far as TV-MA at some of the campier scenes. This DVD is just rated TV-PG, period.  Leading me to believe (I hope I'm wrong) some scenes were cut.  Adding to that concern, Cartoon Network has done so in the past-- with DVD/Blu-Ray releases of Adventure Time, Dexter's Laboratory, Gumball, etc. 2.) I'm pretty sure that CN is either selling now, or is definately releasing in the future, OTGW on Blu-Ray.  Personally, I'll wait for that.

Update 10/29/15: I know that I'm not really supposed to post links here, but there is a petition for the Blu-Ray release on KICKSTARTER... https://www.change.org/p/cartoon-network-over-the-garden-wall-blu-ray-release-2?recruiter=302302029&utm_source=share_petition.

However, when it comes to the dvd its self I have a few complaints. 1 There could have been more special features. The audio is unbalanced for the commentary because the commentaries are kind of quiet but when they don't talk the volume on the show becomes really loud. If you play all episodes in between each episode they have the end credits as well as the cartoon network logo with its really loud out of place drum sound bit, it messes with the flow of the series if you want to watch it like a movie. There doesn't seem to be any way to have the credits or cartoon network logo not play between the episodes. There's just some dvd formatting that I would prefer was different, other than this the show is amazing.",1442102400,11,831,4.2993630573248405

I am very pleased with all of the features that come with the DVD, especially for the great price! One of the special features I was most excited for was the Composer's Cut, however, it took me a few minutes to actually find because it's not actually in the Special Features menu of the DVD, but in the Play All menu. Also, the first time I attempted to play the DVD with a USB disc reader connected to my laptop I was unable to access the Special Features menu, so I tried it in my PS3 and it ended up working in there. This is probably a fault of the disc player, not the DVD, but I thought I might mention it in case anyone else runs into the same issue.

I did not get to see all of the Cartoon but, what I did get to watch I LOVED it. I love how Wirt, and Greg finally notices that they were lost, I love the Pumpkin people. I love that part when the Pumpkin says "" pumpkins can't talk, can they?"" like the way he said it was totally cool. And, Auntie lol.

7331734,5,B0119RZ67O,"One of the most hauntingly beautiful and emotionally charged animated mini-series I've ever seen. Alternately moody, creepy, funny, and uplifting. The voice actors and music are pitch-perfect. The animation and backgrounds are lovingly and painstakingly evocative. Most importantly, this is a labor of love that took creator Patrick McHale almost 10 years from conception to finished product. Kudos to Cartoon Network for supporting and finally releasing this masterwork on DVD (which promises special features and extra to be announced).",1441756800,,538,5.822784810126582
7331735,5,B0119RZ67O,"The first episode of this mini series opens up on two young boys walking alone in a wood, one trying to name a frog and the other simply walking. In a manner very similar to a dream, the older brother Wirt realizes that he has no idea where they are, while Greg seems unconcerned as he continues trying to name his frog.

Every single mystery in this story is weaved beautifully into the narrative in a way that feels as though it could save the modern cartoon. In a world where fairytales are constant remakes of the same story and the characters are the same (not going to name any names or ice princesses), OTGW is a refreshing and wonderful change. Music and animation are uniquely crafted along with mysterious and beautiful characters that create an amazing narrative that while at times a bit dark, show the importance of responsibility and moving forward over dwelling in the past.

It really is a break from other animated series where there's often times a lot of bright, vibrant colors and fast pacing. Each episode shows more and more of what is The Unknown, the setting where the protagonists Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice roam. In addition, the brilliant writing for the show makes you care for whatever is in store for these three protagonists, including the secondary characters that add life and depth to the story.

Patrick McHale has given us an intellectual animated series that invokes awe and adventure, suspense and deep-thinking.

The project itself is a bit unique- a mini-series that ran for 5 nights that chronicled the story of two brothers wandering through a strange place trying to get home. No merchandising tie-is, no big commercial grab- just a story filled with songs, peppered with Vaudeville and Folklore.

Over the Garden wall open with two brothers who find themselves inexplicably lost in the woods. How they got there or where the came from is a bit of a mystery. While in the woods they encounter friends and foes. Each episode they have adventures some scary, some humorous but all moving the overall story forward.

The only other thing i liked as much was The Grand Budapest Hotel. OTGW is incredibly charming, and just the right amount of....everything. Just enough childish whimsy, just enough song, just enough darkness, and it's just long enough. This is one of those pieces that you love so much you want more, but were there any more it would lose a bit of its magic. Though I adore Adventure Time, Regular Show, and the like, this is a refreshing departure that harkens back to themes of classic fairy tales. As the eldest brother in my family, and with a younger brother quite like Greg, i could relate particularly well to the main character Wirt. This piece is like Adventure Time in that if you have a sense of humor and enjoy cartoons you really can enjoy this at literally any age, and every age group will get slightly different things out of it - which is what makes it so beautiful. Not to mention visually it's superbly rendered. This is one of the rare pieces that I honestly can say is perfect.

I was 19 when I watched it for the first time and I was absolutely enthralled by it. If you love and appreciate animation, you will enjoy this show. It is worth looking into the inspirations for it. Everything in it was inspired by either an early animation, fairytale, myth, story, or something similar. It is a cartoon network series, meaning it is aimed towards a younger audience, however this series might have frightened me just a little bit as a child, but I was afraid of everything. The best way for me to describe this series is that it is both whimsical and a bit creepy (but in the best way). It is best to watch this in the Fall, right around Halloween.
Only downside to this DVD that I have seen is that when you choose to play all of the episodes, the credits play between every episode, followed by the cartoon network logo/jingle, which I feel can take you out of the mood a bit.",1533859200,,994,4.349462365591398

If you're a fan of animation and the story telling possible within the medium as through a lens of 00s era cartoons, I think you can do a lot worse than this mini-series. Both haunting, subtle, and quietly quirky, Over the Garden Wall is the sort of art governed by a larger corporate entity that they just don't make any more. Finding ways to work with and around the regulations that a network like Cartoon Network would put in place on something that would normally prevent its completely free expression makes it a really interesting study in ""what it means to craft art for the big dogs"". The all star cast also helps breath life into almost any spoken role as well as the stellar soundtrack makes it a joy to listen to as well as watch. My wife and I watch it every year in the lead up to October to really start getting into the mood of the season while also reflecting on the messages found within each little story in each episode.
Highly recommended for fans of animation of any stripe and for kids who like stories that have a more somber and subtly dark tone.",1529539200,,1113,4.434146341463415
