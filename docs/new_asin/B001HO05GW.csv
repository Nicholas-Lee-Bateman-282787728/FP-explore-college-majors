I have purchased many a fitness DVD since this one,yet it still finds it's way into my regular rotation. Love it!",1428710400,,261,4.137254901960785
8309228,3,B001HO05GW,"The Hollywood Code Red Workout is a supplemental exercise program for the Barry's Bootcamp Complete Workout System (which comes with this DVD). This workout requires a fitness ball and resistance bands.

Hollywood Code Red is a fifteen-minute, ten-exercise workout that compiles some of the most intense exercises from the Barry's Bootcamp Fat Blaster DVDs and adds a couple of new ones. This workout features actress Natalie Raitano, who disrupts the Cindy Whitmarsh/Barry Jay interplay from the original programs (you don't miss it until it's gone) and brings nothing to the table except cleavage (which is never in short supply in any of the Barry's Bootcamp workouts). This product is billed as a ""6-day rapid-fire weight loss workout,"" but if you have the Barry's Bootcamp Complete Workout System and keep up with its calendar's schedule, you're probably not going to use it much.

These are some intense exercises, but this program wasn't intended to be used on its own, and it's not a good value if you buy it by itself. For a superior workout, get the Barry's Bootcamp Complete Workout System and get the whole shebang.",1324252800,2,1127,5.053763440860215

8309230,1,B001HO05GW,"I guess I should have read into this one a little further before buying. Apparently, you need to have a Barry's Bootcamp ball and some resistance bands. I have a regular stability ball but Barry's is almost like a 'canister' or 'tube' shape so a normal ball won't work. (In one of the first work out scenes they lay on ball on their backs with the resistance tube underneath for chest presses)It looked to be a pretty good workout but I honestly didn't get too far into it for lack of proper equiptment. :(
I looked on amazon to see how much one of his balls were and was disappointed to see that they were $40-$50. I guess I'll know better next time to read more closely to see if there is any 'special' equiptment needed before I buy.",1298505600,8,736,4.302158273381295
8309231,5,B001HO05GW,"I have to say that this is the BEST workout I have ever done! Why? This is the ONLY workout that has motivated me to want to do it 5 days a week. I have been to the gym, tried other workouts, but this is the ONLY one that has worked for me and kept me motivated to want to work out. The 1000 calorie workout is only 45 minutes long (if that) and you only do 10 different workouts for 100 reps each. The workouts are not hard, meaning I didn't get discouraged doing them. You know how it is when you do some workouts and you've had enough after a couple reps either because they are very uncomfortable, extremely hard to do, or just plain boring. These are FUN. I actually look forward to working out which I use to NEVER want to do. I did buy the original Barry's Bootcamp workout and really liked those workouts too, but the 1000 calorie one is by far my favorite. I have been overweight for a very long time... I've tried different diets, workout programs, gyms, etc and was never satisfied nor happy with them nor the results I got. You know the loose fatty skin that hangs on the back of your arms... the stuff that shakes when you wave... well I can honestly tell you that after do this workout for a week, I have noticed that area getting tighter and not shaking as much!!! This may not be a big deal for those who don't already have that flabby skin, but let me tell you it's a WONDERFUL feeling when you can physically feel it being tighter and it not shaking as much! So far I have lost over an inch in my thigh, waist, arms, chest, and hip area. PLUS I can tell that I am finally getting tighter and can feel muscle building up (not like Arnold muscle, but enough to give definition). I am very pleased with the results and the program itself and highly recommend this workout collection. I usually get bored easily and frustrated easy too, but have no complaints at all with this collection. I also wanted to add that I have started drinking more water (yuck) because of using these workouts. If you sweat they say you need more water so needless to say I have been drinking it more, sweating less and actually starting to somewhat LIKE drinking water (which I have never been a big fan of drinking water, EVER). Plus since doing these workouts it has motivated me to eat better too. I hope this has been helpful as I am a very satisfied customer.",1262476800,6,2358,4.265625
8309232,5,B001HO05GW,"...but I loved it. I'm a complete beginner and could just do 20 min at the first time,but loved it a lot...and it dosnt bore you. The disadvantage I had is that you need to order the additional equipment for those DVDs, so I would suggest to order the whole package and its gonna be cheaper then you buy it saperatly.",1250812800,3,317,4.213114754098361
8309233,5,B001HO05GW,"I just finished the Ab Workout and the 1000 Calorie Workout.  Great DVD's!  Once again it is a pleasure to work out with Cindy W.  She is a professional and a delight to work out with. Barry chatters on and on, but you need some chatter to keep your mind off 100 reps!  I am glad I purchased this.  I, too, found a better deal at Barry's website.  If you like Bootcamp, you will like this.  However, I think the sound quality is not as good as on the Bootcamp Fat Burning package.  Who listens much anyway?",1249344000,,506,4.144329896907217
8309234,4,B001HO05GW,it is $30 cheaper on the barry's bootcamp website.  Save your money and get it start from the barry's bootcamp site.  I bought mine for 14.95 plus shipping and handling for this set.,1232409600,11,182,4.484848484848484
8309235,5,B001HO05GW,Code Red is great!  I lost 4 pounds in 6 day when I used i with Fatblaster and the MS workouts.  It is a really good kick in the but with or without the diet.  It's only 15 minutes!  You will love it!,1226534400,7,200,3.5813953488372094
