8462642,4,B00592T9HY,"Bittersweet, often sad, occasionally funny documentary.  A reel of film from 1965 shows a party where some local Swedish rock stars hang out with the Stones after a concert.  We meet some of the people from that party, 40 years later.  Glamour has fallen away, and all now live lives very far from the sexy, carefree youth we see in the old footage.  Loss, death, divorce, physical aging are all part of these peoples lives.  The film catches the way older people can be discarded by society at large, even if their less than fairy tale lives have been full of the real stuff, children, work, love, tragedies.  Its a short film, but it says a lot, some of it hard to hear, about the nature of aging, dreams and reality, and how choices that seem small at the moment, can echo through the rest of a life.",1453334400,,803,4.391891891891892
