8310629,5,B001IB2ZOO,"Purchased this DVD to help my students understand the signing of a classmate. We all enjoy the many Signing Time DVDs, they are topic specific, last about half an hour. Real children are shown sighing, so children have many opportunities to read the signs on other children's hands.  Very beneficial to us. Purchased used in excellent condition. Covers common chores and activities around the home.",1336089600,2,398,5.123076923076923
