8315045,5,B001KIKSWQ,"Excellent, easy to follow instruction and great, great fun.  I bought this dvd for my daughter's birthday to supplement her classes at her dance studio.  Instructor Barry YoungBlood has an engaging personality and breaks the moves down very well - as if you're actually in his class.  The four high energy routines he teaches are each different in speed and difficulty which makes for a great variety.  Well Done!",1258329600,,413,4.942028985507246
