This video is probably the best of the series, perhaps due to the fact that most people, well, don't expect much from punk music.  But the video does a good job of describing the attitudes which led to punk's rise, and the messages that punk's various bands were trying to get across--against establishment injustice, corporate rock, and conventional authority, all of which were pretty bad in the seventies (add a stagnant economy to it as well).

Some of my favorites in this video--a member of the Sex Pistols describes how he became acquainted with his manager-to-be by saying, in effect: ""He owned this clothing store where I used to hang out, and I always liked him and wanted his advice, but I was also shoplifting from him at the time.""  I also enjoyed Elvis Costello's narrative of how he got a record contract in a matter of days.  Also an early performance of U2, which sounds kind of punky.

Music historians have a tough job trying to classify music of the past and organize it into history, and they do something weird here.  While starting with the punk movement in the 70s and early 80s, they then meander through a couple of years and get to Nirvana in the 1990s.  Maybe this really is how punk evolves, but I think most viewers will have the same reaction: ""Huh?  How'd they get all the way to Nirvana?""

Guess what you find in a video about punk rockers--profanity!  There's lots of it here, and so this video is not really appropriate for high-school use.  That's really a shame, but it's been a pattern here.",1103241600,,1692,4.6375838926174495
7905730,3,B000009UQ7,"In defense of this documentary (or should I say, portion of a very long documentary), it meant a LOT to me when I was 14. A whole lot. It was one of the many things in that year or two time period that changed everything for me. However, going back now and watching it... good god. It's so incredibly flawed! Granted, it's only an hour, but their idea of punk, and what they bother to cover, is so limited. Even though I think it's inaccurate, I can see starting with the Stooges and Velvet Underground... but ENOUGH about the Sex Pistols and the Clash, already!! They're only ""important"" because they were accessible enough to dig their way into the mainstream (don't kid yourselves...).
  Also, as far as that ""first"" era ('76-'80 or so) goes, where were Suicide, the Dead Boys, Throbbing Gristle, Devo (not punk? you, sir or madam, have been mislead!), Pere Ubu, the Germs, and a thousand other bands better than the Sex Pistols and the Clash combined? Hey, and what happened to the lion's share of the '80s? Oh, punk must've died in 1980, that's right! ......
  Oddly enough, though, I still get some kind of sick enjoyment out of this movie. That said, I do not recommend it to any adult who's actually a fan of punk rock.",1049587200,4,1227,4.513513513513513
