7066702,4,B00UOYITZU,"I remember watching this miniseries (TV-Movie) a long time ago on the old TNT (back in the day). It's the same as Peter Benchley's The Beast, one in which I also remember watching a long time ago on the old TNT, for it comes with 2 discs which makes it a two-parter it would seem. An impressive design of the shark-like humanoid which terrorizes the people in this miniseries as a product of a military experiment gone wrong. And also very good cast consisting of Craig T. Nelson (who I best know from Poltergeist, Disney Pixar's The Incredibles, The District TV show as well as his most famous role in Coach which I have never seen), Colm Feore, & Giancarlo Esposito (who I best know for lending his voice in a couple of DC Animated titles as well as the TV show Breaking Bad, which I also haven't seen yet). Still, it is a scary movie in its own right.",1434067200,9,854,4.34375

7066704,4,B00UOYITZU,"Impressive Blu-ray! I debated picking this up on blu, as I already have the DVD and wasn't sure how much of an improvement this would be. I'm incredibly impressed with the transfer. For a '98 flick it looks very clear and detailed. Very sharp picture for fans of the flick!

7066705,4,B00UOYITZU,"I am reviewing the new Blu-ray by Olive Films:

I was jumping for joy when I heard Olive Films was bringing this to Blu-ray. I am a huge Peter Benchley fan and equally a fan of TV movies, specifically when they are based on awesome books. I remember watching this on TV when it ran the first time. I had read the book and was so excited that it was going to be a TV film. There are two TV films of Peter Benchleys that I love, one being this one, Creature, and the other being the great, underappreciated, The Beast. Both are fantastic to the fantasy, sci-fi, horror lover of the deep, dark recesses of the fathoms and unexplored regions of the ocean. This is a perfect transfer, and new outlet to this TV film. A golden ticket in my viewpoint. This is pure creature feature horror at its wildest, and old-school, late night, Drive-in wonderment.

This has all the mentality of the classic creature feature films of the 50s and 60s. Directed by a wonderful director Stuart Gillard. Mainly a TV director, but he has also done feature films for the theater run, such as the often underappreciated entry of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film series, 1993s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. He has done other feature films, but his main claim to fame is, TV movies and TV series. I think he gave Creature a great old-school feel, mixed with the page turning reality of a classic creature feature, horror book.

This stars the wonderful Craig T. Nelson as Dr. Simon Chase. I have always been a huge fan of Nelson. Growing up watching him in the Poltergeist films and the TV series Coach has left an affection for his craft within me. I have often thought he was an overlooked and underappreciated performer. I think he is an excellent actor that should be praised and honored for his wonderful talent in cinema. I loved him in Creature. He gave his all and everything to the part.

Another spectacular example of creating a worthy Blu-ray to own. Olive Films knows how to award the movie lover with great products.

7066723,3,B00UOYITZU,"BOTTOM LINE: An OK (albeit long) time killer about a berserk, mutated shark-man on the loose in a tropical island community. This release seems to be the complete 2-part mini-series. It sports a decent transfer, but it sucks that there are no subtitles & no special features. If ya gotta have it, I say buy it used. 3 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): In the early 1970's, as part of their research to develop anti-Charlie weapons for the Vietnam war, U.S. government eggheads create mutant killer whatchamacallits by combining sharks, dolphins & humans. The research is hastily abandoned when one of the creatures goes nuts and kills pretty much everything in sight before it's captured and dumped in the drink. Decades later, a cancer cure-obsessed shark researcher encounters the beast, still alive somehow, when it's accidentally released. He must quickly figure out a way to destroy the thing before it begins breeding.

THOUGHTS: Old school-styled so-so monster-on-the-loose flick gets my nod for two reasons - 1) it's got a sweet man-in-suit critter, courtesy of F/X legend Stan Winston, and 2) it features sexy Kim Cattrall cavorting about in skimpy outfits for most of the film. This adaption of Peter (JAWS) Benchley's book 'Whiteshark' is faithful enough, but sadly it doesn't take the opportunity to address and fix the shortcomings of the source material. Honestly, the film could've easily been trimmed by an hour and not lost any narrative focus. But in 1998 this was an ""event film"" for TV, released in two parts as a mini-series/movie of the week, much the same as Benchley's later novel, 'The Beast,' (which is similar in many ways to this story/film). ""Coach"" actor Craig T. Nelson is well-cast here as Dr. Simon Chase, laid back yet intense when the situation calls for it. Cress Williams is especially good as Chases' friend & co-worker, Tall Man. (And a special mention to actor Giancarlo Esposito, playing the totally whacked out Lt. Peniston/Werewolf.) Movie's monster F/X are achieved using old school practical trickery that looks great on camera. The optical work is a mixed bag, with some pretty cringe-worthy CGI matte footage. Direction & cinematography are routine but solid. The West Indies location scenery is nice to look at. Musical score is appropriately eerie. Look quick for author Peter Benchley as a snooty sport-fishing tourist. In the end, CREATURE is a fun, harmless (and mostly bloodless) throwback/love letter to all those ""guy in a costume"" monster movies we watched over & over on late night/weekend Creature Feature shows as kids.

THE BLU-RAY: Olive Films gives us a solid transfer that looks & sounds quite good, but this hi-def release is knocked down a few notches by having absolutely ZERO bonus features, plus the odd decision of not offering subtitles for hearing-impaired viewers. It's a shame that the director, cast & crew were not tracked down for new interviews. Olive Films didn't even bother to dig up readily available vintage promotional tidbits and include them. All-in-all, this is a lazy slapdash release, but at least the picture & sound are improved enough to make this worth owning, if you don't already have it on VHS or DVD. Whether or not it warrants a double-dip upgrade depends on just how big a fan of the film you are.",1480723200,3,3299,5.005464480874317

7066725,4,B00UOYITZU,"This TV movie was great, but I am a sci-fi lover and Peter Benchley. Acting is great for the genre, good quality actors, and not too many subplots. Makes you wonder what the government was up to with all the dolphin experiments in the 70's, too. This movie is now in my sci-fi collection. Worth it.",1474329600,4,298,4.339285714285714

8707819,2,B00UOYITZU,"Wow, it's hard to believe the number of positive reviews this turkey has received here.  My brothers and I were so stoked to watch this TV movie when when it was initially released, so one can imagine our deep disappointment when it ended up being one of the absolute stupidest shows ever.  The crazy ""Werewolf"" guy is an annoying pain in the rear, the story is convoluted, and the acting is weak and stiff.  But watching a terrible movie with my brothers is much like watching it with the MST3K guys, so the jokes being bandied about made it worth forging ahead.  And, soon, things seemed to brighten when it appeared that a stupid, barking dog was in danger of being devoured like an hor d'oeuvre.  But even those high hopes were soon dashed when ""The Creature"" turned out to be an animal lover and spared the lousy dog.....what a rip!!  At that point, the only thing that kept us watching was anticipation of the Big Reveal and finally seeing ""The Creature"" in all its latex glory.  Overall, it isn't too exactly disappointing, but was ultimately made ridiculous by the fact it was sporting dreadlocks (yep).  The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was a hoot to lampoon.  And while some movies are so bad they're actually worth watching, I just can't say the same for ""Creature.""  I saw it in 1998 and have never once had the desire to watch it again.",1525046400,,1369,4.483870967741935
