8068637,5,B0009WPTL4,I purchased this DVD for my husband and he loves it. He told me that he was hitting the ball better than ever and shot one of the lowest scores he's ever had. The instruction is easily understandable and each thought is explained in simple terms.,1121040000,,246,4.369565217391305
