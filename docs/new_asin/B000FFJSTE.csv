8121642,3,B000FFJSTE,"I have long admired this program featured on PBS, HDNET and
EQUATOR on VOOM!

But what a ripoff in HD for $17.00 !

All you really get is the ""skeleton"" program from the
PBS provider! (Less than 50 minutes!)

At least on EQUATOR (VOOM) you get several minutes of additional
footage.

Rudy, come on and offer us a better deal in HD!",1200355200,2,331,4.290322580645161
