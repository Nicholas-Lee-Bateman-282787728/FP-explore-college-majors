7901023,3,8377696703,"This is an interesting film.  The cinematography is very good; the acting is very good; the locations seem appropriately desolate and cold, but the plot is convoluted and meandering (probably the result of poor editing).  [In addition--a mild annoyance--the English subtitles areevery now and thenleft dangling meaninglessly (as if there was only so much subtitle space that could be used on the screen, and words that were required to finish a sentence were excised because they exceeded the limit).]

Be that as it may, this film provokes a concomitant side issue that relates to the story's source.  The book, ""Syberiada Polska,"" was written by Zbigniew Domino in 2001, and it details the struggles of those Poles from eastern Poland who were deported to the labor camps in Siberia soon after the 1939 Soviet invasion, whenas stipulated by the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pacteastern Poland was annexed to the USSR.  Domino was about ten years old when he and his family were among the hundreds of thousands who were forced out of their Polish homes and sent east to work in Siberia.  And although the film is not especially sympathetic to the Soviet authorities who supervised the harsh Polish internment, Domino returned to Poland after the war (ca. 1946)) as an avid Communist.

His rise through the ranks of the Polish Communist Party landed him in the middle of the Polish judiciary during the time (1950s) that the brutal hardline communists were arresting, torturing, and executing so many of WWIIs heroic Polish anti-Nazi resistance fighters because of their perceived threat to communist rule. [Its sobering to learn that Dominos climb to prominence was aided by the infamous prosecutor, Helena Wolinska, whoafter having lost favor with the communistsemigrated in 1971 to Great Britain, where she successfully fought off three (post-Solidarity) attempts to extradite her back to Poland to stand trial for Stalinist-era war crimes.]

In the final analysis, whether Domino is guilty of having succumbed  to the Stockholm syndrome, or is just another example of Hannah Arendts concept of the banality of evil (or both), his role as an important functionary of the Communist Party, who investigated, participated, and witnessed the executions of a considerable number of Polish patriots (in the 1950s) profoundly tarnishes our respect for his reputation and character, at the same time that his literary gifts serve to amplify the history of the USSRs mass deportations to Siberia.

PS. I would also note that the DVD has a four minute supplement that intermingles clips from the movie with a performance by Anna Wyszkoni and Piotr Cugowski.  It can be seen on youtube (Anna Wyszkoni, Piotr Cugowski SIBERIA), and although I don't understand a word that they're singing, its a remarkably moving video  turn up the volume, click on the full screen icon, and enjoy",1448668800,6,2885,5.167381974248927
