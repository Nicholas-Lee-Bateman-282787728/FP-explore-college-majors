8175453,4,B000N7M6DY,"""Revival"" is one of the earliest of the Gaither Homecoming video series. It was recorded and produced at the Gaither Studios in 1995.

Last year a friend passed along to us a collection of a dozen or so of the Gaither Homecoming video series. Although we have been fans and followers of the Gaithers over the years we had not yet experienced the joy and value of these concerts. Over the last few months we have added numerous recordings to our library. ""Revival"" is our latest edition.

These earlier videos have a unique excitement and reflect a pure joy of singing and a genuine bond of love and commitment of the participants. Highlights for me included: Dallas Holm featured singing his song ""Rise Again,"" Danny Gaither singing a verse of ""The Longer I Serve Him,"" Jake Hess singing ""Faith Unlocks the Door,"" and Ivan Parker joining Bill and Gloria Gaither singing ""We Have This Moment.""

Another wonderful evening of entertainment and uplifting worship paying tribute to Jesus.",1313452800,,983,4.874251497005988
