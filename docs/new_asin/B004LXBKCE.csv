8435273,5,B004LXBKCE,"I can tell you I didn't care much about A. Chenier and Pagliacci (Snob translated: I Pagliacci), these are two very standard performances in the popular repertory with reviews all over.

But if you really love opera, you can't miss EL Gato Monts (Andal translated: Er Gato Mont). This is a collector's item! This is the only recording I know for it, and my favorite Spanish opera of all time. I just heard they were playing last week in Madrid at Teatro de la Zarzuela (just the same place where it started), damn I missed it!

Nobody, NO BODY, better than Placido Domingo for Rafaelillo role, also all other main roles were great with vibrant and strong voices perfectly adapted to the time people in Seville talked with that funny southern Spanish accent, or better said, southern pronunciation. Many still talk like that today, but normally not that exaggerated. Talking about pronunciation, the only distracting thing was the Spanish pronunciation mistakes of some of the supporting singers. Namely Michael Gallup as Hormigon was having a bad time with many words showing clearly his American origin, but I have to concede that he was doing very well taking in consideration the huge effort of singing a whole opera not only in a second language, but a language he certainly didn't have much chance to interpret before. It was just funny to see this role of typical Sevillano talking like an Americano.

By the way, if you feel that $40+ is too much, go as I did to the public library... 4 FREEE!",1331942400,,1500,4.739463601532567
8435274,4,B004LXBKCE,"This is a wonderful set of operas in which Placido Domingo is the star.  You get Andrea Chenier from 1985, El Gato Monts from 1994, and Pagliacci from 1997.  There is also a bonus dvd of about 35 minutes of an interview with Domingo done recently, wherein he discusses each of the 3 operas.

Andrea Chenier is from Covent Garden, with Julius Rudel conducting.  I've seen a number of Cheniers, and this ranks near the top.  Domingo is in wonderful voice, filling the ardent poetry of Chenier with his usual intensity and vivid acting.  Anna Tomowa-Sintow is nearly as good as Maddalena.  The great Italian baritone Giorgio Zancanaro almost steals the show, with his noble portrayal of the revolutionary with a heart, who initially wants to tear down society, but later realizes that he's hurting the people whom he most loves and admires.  And it's too late.  The production is traditional, and works well.  The only problem is the dated video.  It's 4:3, standard def, looks blurry and washed out.  I'm just spoiled by blurays, but I wish they would have been able to improve the quality.  You do get your choice of English, French, German, Spanish and Japanese subtitles, though.

El Gato Monts (the wild cat) is a rarely performed work from Spanish composer Manuel Penella.  Since Placido Domingo is Spanish, as musical director of the Los Angeles Opera, he was able to get this produced.  It's not really a zarzuela, more of an opera, since there are no spoken parts.  As a matter of fact, it's very much like Bizet's Carmen, except in Spanish.  You have a triangle with the girl, the bullfighter and the outlaw (yes, I know in Carmen the soldier is not an outlaw at first).  But the men's roles are switched, as Placido Domingo plays the bullfighter, who is the ""nice"" character.  The outlaw turns out to be an outlaw only because he loved the girl too much, and things end up quite differently from Carmen.  The three principals are excellent, from Placido Domingo as Rafael the bullfighter, to Vernica Villarroel as Sole, to Justino Daz as Juanillo, the outlaw (the wild cat).  I know Spanish, but was initially surprised at the strange pronunciations of many of the words.  For example, the girl's name is really Soledad, but with the accent, it's pronounced Sole (accent on the last syllable).  I was confused until one of the characters said ""What a great life we have here in Andalusa!""  I looked up Andalusan accent, and found that all the singers were following the directors choice to use that accent.  This made the opera even better, as I was swept away by the warmth and rhythm of the Andalusan Spanish.  Just like the first video, though, the video quality was weak, and the images were blurry.  But since this seems to be the only El Gato Monts available, I'm not complaining.

I remember watching the Washington National Opera's production of Pagliacci in 1997, and taping it.  I recently went back to my tape, and it was unplayable, with a buzzing sound throughout.  What a relief it was to find that this same telecast is included in this boxed set!  It's a magnificent production, designed by Franco Zeffirelli, so bursting with people and color that it was performed alone, without its usual partner of Cavalleria Rusticana.  Again we have Domingo and Villarroel, as Canio and Nedda, and strong singers in the other parts.  The huge cast of extras made the circus atmosphere of the opera come to life.  This was in 1997, and Domingo's voice shows just the slightest decline from the earlier videos, but come on, this is Placido Domingo, one of the greatest acting singers ever, and boy, does he deliver!  He plays Canio as less cruel than many.  As Domingo says in the interview, as he's gotten older, he's realized that Canio is only human, an aging guy who saved a young pretty girl from the streets, married her, and gave her star billing in his show.  How can he NOT go crazy upon finding her unfaithful with a younger man?  The video and sound on this third opera are better than the earlier ones, but still a far cry from modern sharpness.  But we really enjoy opera for the music, right?  On that score, this video delivers as much as we could ask for.",1329609600,3,4182,4.673972602739726
