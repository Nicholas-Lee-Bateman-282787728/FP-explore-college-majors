5751440,3,B00CXN3WGG,"This documentary from REality Films is pretty good and brings in some information, Not heard before.
Not thrilled with talking heads before the same brick building.
The faux footage of the BIGFOOT is similar to ""Andre The Giant"" version seen in `Six Million Dollar Man ` tv episodes seen in the '70s.
The Zapruder,I mean The Patterson/Gimlin film of perhaps a real Bigfoot is referenced and lends more credibility.",1374192000,2,414,5.0144927536231885

 the dvd arrived in great condition and it was on time.",1443484800,,122,4.304347826086956
8587266,1,B00CXN3WGG,"As it's looking like a trend with RE Films (anything with bigfoot, not sure about the other phenomena topics they release), the cover is the best thing about this. If you've never heard a single word about the subject, this release serves as an informmercial about bigfoot as in there's a lot of talking to get you to buy it (then again, you already did by watching this.)

For anyone that pays attention to the subject, you'll be bored to tears by people you mostly never heard of in the field. Back to the cover being the best part, they slapped together some photos (nicely done in some imaging software) on the back and you would think that with all the ""experts"" they talk to through the short disc, they would present some of their evidence. Nope.

Only for people who have to collect every bigfoot release.",1428451200,,813,4.523809523809524

8587269,5,B00CXN3WGG,I chose this rating because the item arrived very promptly and in very good condition it was packaged very well this is a good add on to my monster movie collection,1395532800,,164,4.32258064516129
8587270,1,B00CXN3WGG,"I have no idea what the purpose of this video series was! It is poorly written, poorly shot and the deliveries of the people doing the research is below gradable. Add to that the absolutely horrid CGI animation that the series is soaked in and you have a vomitous glob of poor information and entertainment.

Out of the 4 hours of run time there was only two small tid bits of information I had never heard before and I am far from being any kind of expert on the subject matter.",1391472000,2,479,4.263736263736264
8587271,3,B00CXN3WGG,"Well, I wish it were far more detailed; like actually showing a bigfoot creature or a whole family themselves; I don't know it was just humans talking about their experiences, but NOT what I really expected it to be; you know, I thought they really had a chance to actually capture on film, up close & personal maybe one or more of those creatures & lived to tell about it; & maybe someone was maybe abducted by one & lived to tell about, you know? Thank you; Everybody have a Very Blessed Thanksgiving! Jesus Christ Loves All Of You!",1385337600,,534,4.404040404040404
8587272,4,B00CXN3WGG,"This documentary, mostly shot at the East Coast Bigfoot Conference in 2011, is produced and directed by Jay Michael (Swamp Apes, Honey Island Swamp Monster,  Bigfoot FAQ) and features some familiar faces from the Bigfoot Community, such as Eric Altman, Steve Kulls, Billy Willard, Dave Dragosin, Stan Gordon, Rick Tullos, Tim Cassidy and Dr. Jeff Meldrum discussing their thoughts and theories on what Sasquatch is. The evidence is discussed (footprints, film, DNA, things of that nature), but also the Kill or No-Kill discussion is brought in, with Tullos being the sole proponent of the Pro-Kill argument. When the P/G Film is discussed, Jay uses a photo of Bob Gimlin I allowed him to use for the documentary. Some parts of this were shot in Mississippi with Jay Michael as the host. All in all, this one is good, but not great, mainly due to the familiarity of the subject to us. I wold have preferred more eyewitness accounts and maybe some recreations. There is an actor in a Sasquatch suit seen throughout the production which somewhat resembles the Andre the Giant Bionic Bigfoot suit which makes for an interesting representation of the look of the Sasquatch as well. I would give this documentary a 7 out of 10. It is enjoyable but familiar to we Sasquatch proponents, but I am sure the general public will enjoy it.",1377907200,5,1326,4.841409691629956
