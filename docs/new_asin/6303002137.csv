7833545,5,6303002137,I enjoy the Teresa Mason dance video.  Worth the time and money.  Can pick and choose moves that make your dancing better.,1359331200,,122,4.5
7833546,4,6303002137,"I have several of his video.  I enjoy them, and consider them a step up from beginner.  Learn a few cool moves,  Kyle is a likeable teacher.",1359331200,,140,4.111111111111111
7833547,2,6303002137,this is more on a lower level than advanced.  i was disappointed when there were only three steps to each dance.  i would love to see her give more of an advanced video with more than 3 moves.  i have her country dancing videos and they are more advanced than this video.,1122940800,,271,4.173076923076923
7833548,1,6303002137,"...them, their music, or their wardrobes.  And this is their definition of 'advanced'???  This is an egregious waste of $5.99.  If you're serious about ballroom dancing, spend the extra $$ for a decent series.  I personally like the Starlight Studio.",1114819200,3,250,5.175
7833549,5,6303002137,"This tape at the first time appeared to me (real intermatiate) a bit faster and, at some points, difficult to follow. However, with a little bit more attention, it got me unusual style and feeling of elegance. At least, small part of them.
Teresa's insight and comprehensive understanding about DANCE itself are amazingly well compressed into this tape.
It is really so amazing that it deserve your 'bit more' and sincere attention.",1033171200,3,432,5.013888888888889
7833550,4,6303002137,"Having taken some dance lessons and learning the basics, this tape what just what I needed to add some moves to what I have already learned. Sure some of the dancers are a little corny looking in the opening introductions for each dance, but the instruction from Kyle and Susan was well worth the price of this tape.
Don't know why Kyle demonstrates the female's part when Susan is right there, but it still works.
I jumped over the Intermediate to buy the Advanced, not even thinking this tape would amount to much, based solely on the price, now since I'm pleased with this tape I'll go back and buy the Intermediate.
I also bought their Swing tapes, very helpful.",1029974400,7,666,4.558333333333334
7833551,5,6303002137,intermediate to advanced steps are presented clearly and in detail. I found it much better than some other tapes available.,949881600,9,123,5.2
7833552,1,6303002137,"The instruction is clear,precise and understandable but, with the word Advanced in the title I expected at a minimum Silver Standard figures. The steps shown were clearly Bronze Standard and in no way advanced. I would  like to see Silver and Gold tapes by Ms. Mason because she is an excellent  instructor.",944438400,15,307,4.884615384615385
7833553,5,6303002137,"The tape is packed with clearly explained advanced ballroom steps for the basic dances.  The tape moves along quickly, so keep your remote control handy.",922752000,11,153,5.12
7833554,5,6303002137,"The format of this tape is well organized and easy to follow. While few can duplicate the style and elegance of Teresa and her partner, it is a very inspiring presentation from which dancers at all levels of skill can  benefit.",922579200,9,227,4.536585365853658
