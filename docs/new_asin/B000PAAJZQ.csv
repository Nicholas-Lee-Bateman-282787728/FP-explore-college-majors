2814641,4,B000PAAJZQ,"It is funny.  If you are sick of anime, slapstick comedy, there is Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law.  The animation quality is dismal, but you would be laughing too hard to be bothered by it.

Warning: Due to the nature of the topics covered, it is definitely unsuitable for minors.",1227657600,3,281,4.58
2814642,5,B000PAAJZQ,"Everytime I watch these I find something new to laugh at.  Adult humor, crude (in the best sense of the word), without slipping into adolescent locker room territory.",1221782400,,166,4.928571428571429
2814643,1,B000PAAJZQ,"hmmmm.  Tell me, why I would spend $80.00 for this product when I can purchase all 3 (seperately) for $69.50?",1198195200,3,109,4.45
2814644,5,B000PAAJZQ,"...And by case I mean this 3 volume box set (yes pun intended). As a fan of many adult animated program nothing to me was more creative or origional as Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law. Like its partner in crime 'Sealab 2021 the creative minds of the cartoon network studio took an old washed up cartoon and turned it into some great. Birdman a third rate superhero has decided to fight crime in the manor of fancy suits and legal fees. Bringing some of Hanna Barera's most lovable characters to the stand for doing things we weren't meant to see.

The lawsuits fly and the antics go out of control as Harvey voiced by the genuine Gary Cole (Brady Bunch Movie)throws his life on the line to defend everyone from Fred Flintstone, to Scooby Doo and many others. Going up against some of his fierce enemies nothing but monster belly laughs are had by all. This show features a great cast of famous comedians as Stephen Colbert (The Daily Show) Michael McKean (Best In Show) & Lewis Black just to name a few. A show that took 6 long years to come up with these 39 unforgetable episodes fans of this show can now hold on their fondest memories of a show that most of this world will probably forget about in the next 24 hours.

Recommended Episode per Volume:
Volume One: Showyu Weenie
Volume Two: Back To The Present
Volume Three: Identity Theft.",1187222400,2,1341,4.491803278688525
2814645,1,B000PAAJZQ,"Harvey Birdman is filled with comic delight and was indeed the best show [adult swim] has ever offered up.  That said, DO NOT get this 3-pack.  I purchased the complete series of Sealab 2021 this way because it was cheaper and all four seasons came together in a plastic wrapper.  This is not the case with Harvey Birdman Volume 1-3.  Most [adult swim] DVDs on Amazon are about $20.  But this 3-pack averages each volume at $27!!!  Great idea, Amazon, but cut back on the price.  I don't think you'd lose money by making this set $50-$60.",1186444800,12,538,4.484536082474227

2814669,2,B000PAAJZQ,I was so happy to see this finally arriving to my house..but then I opened the first season box and notice the second dvd was missing. I'm giving it two stars just because I was glad that the other disc weren't missing:/,1426464000,,220,4.261904761904762

2814671,5,B000PAAJZQ,"If you enjoyed watching hannah barberra cartoons when you were younger, you'll deffinitly get a kick out of Harvey Birdman defending them all as their defence attorney in a courtroom, from Shaggy and Scooby being profiled as Stoners by the police too the custody battle for Johnny Quest & Hadji",1413158400,,294,4.9
2814672,5,B000PAAJZQ,Great series.  Nostalgic and new at the sane time.  Hannah Babera is not afraid to make fun itself. Enjoy the fun !!!,1411516800,,117,4.2727272727272725

2814686,5,B000PAAJZQ,"I'm a big fan of Adult Swim shows... well, I used to be when I had cable television.

At any rate, of all the hilarious, subversive, weird shows on Adult Swim, Harvey Birdman was and remains my favorite. There's really no premise or plot per se that I need to explain in a review. Just know it was voiced by a hodge podge of funny people including the one and only Stephen Colbert.",1402963200,,381,4.219178082191781
2814687,5,B000PAAJZQ,"I laughed harder, more often, and longer at Harvey Birdman than I have at any other show on Adult Swim. I grew up with Hanna- Barbera cartoons, as did millions of others, and the references and cross-references in these shows had me pounding the floor, hysterical. The show's creators/writers just kept making the shows faster and faster, packing in more jokes all along the way, and they had terrific comedians like Gary Cole, Stephen Colbert and many others zinging out the one-liners. The creative talent behind these shows clearly had a ball spoofing all those cartoon characters, and inventing wild, weird backstories for the regular and recurring characters. Where else would you find Fred Flintstone depicted as an animated Tony Soprano?",1402012800,,744,5.1570247933884295
2814688,5,B000PAAJZQ,"Who doesn't like the old Hannah-Barbara cartoons? And who wouldn't like a show poking fun at how ridiculous they could be - in the most ridiculous ways possible. Harvey Birdman is a creative, fun show that comes in short, quick episodes that'll have you marathoning the show before you know it. Stephen Colbert voices several characters, Gary Cole makes a great Birdman.",1393891200,,370,4.983870967741935
2814689,5,B000PAAJZQ,I loved Harvey Birdman growing up so when my friend graduated law school this year I had to buy these for her. The show is great and the packaging for the DVDs looks like old beat up leather books which is a cool touch. I would recommend these to any Adult Swim fan.,1389398400,,266,4.037735849056604
2814690,5,B000PAAJZQ,One of my favourites. Great cast and well timed humour. Excellent use of of the old and irrelevant cartoon characters of the 70's,1386460800,,129,4.6521739130434785

2814692,5,B000PAAJZQ,I bought this for my husband. He loves this show and so do i. it's funny and so many older cartoons are the icing on the cake,1367539200,,125,3.6666666666666665
2814693,5,B000PAAJZQ,"Anyone who group up in the 70s watching the old Scooby Doo, Speed Buggy, Jetson's, etc., cartoons, will love this series because they make reference to these old classics over and over.  And Stephen Colbert does a voice of one of the characters.  Highly recommend.",1356480000,,264,4.844444444444444
2814694,5,B000PAAJZQ,"My girlfriend is a huge Colbert fan, and this was a pre-Colbert Report endeavor.  It is off-the-wall and intelligent dry humor, or an American British humor.

The packaging is excellent, and if one is going to buy something like this, it needs to be the complete series as this one is.

Excellent show and product.",1350259200,,314,4.672727272727273
2814695,5,B000PAAJZQ,"When I describe this show to friends as a mix between Night Court, Law & Order, and The Tick, they don't normally respond with positive feedback. Harvey Birdman is amazing no matter how difficult it may be to describe it's level of awesomeness. Steven Colbert's performances alone are worth the price of admission; The ""One Eyed"" boss character with peripheral problems, and Reducto with his shrink ray are both laugh out loud (huh... so that's what that looks like spelled out) hilarious. I cannot recommend this collection enough.",1344902400,,532,5.056818181818182

This is a perfect buy if you want access to all of the episodes at once, especially since they don't show it that much on TV anymore. Anyone who loves the absurd and edgy humor of say Family Guy or ATHF should buy this.",1319414400,4,292,4.051724137931035
2814708,3,B000PAAJZQ,Show us just ok.  Most other adult swim shows are better but then again things like this are a matter if opinion.  Others may love it.  Not sure id buy without catching a episode free on tv first but im sure it has its fans,1311120000,,223,3.911111111111111

2814713,5,B000PAAJZQ,"One of the few shows that I feel deserves a higher price! This show is a must-have for any Adult Swim lover, or anyone who enjoys any off-the-wall type humor. The voice casting is also very well done, with many ""I recognize that voice!"" moments. With so many shows and DVD sets being pumped out recently, it's hard to tell which are worth your time and/or money, I just want to say that this is definitely one of them. A must have, especially for the price.",1247443200,10,457,4.325581395348837
2814714,5,B000PAAJZQ,"The Harvey Birdman Attorney At Law series is an instant favorite that has something for everyone comedy-wise. Even the DVD sleeves make me laugh due to the artwork and references to the show. The show is brilliant with both high and low brow humor. Almost everything is innuendo, except when Birdgirl has something on her mind. The show is fast paced and will cause lots of double-takes. The show parodies the legal system, corporate life, and even well known criminal cases.",1241913600,15,475,4.8765432098765435

8189985,5,B000PAAJZQ,"Out of any DVD I have ever purchased, I have to say the Harvey Birdman DVD set ihas given me the most use and enjoyment. Featuring the amazing talents of Stephen Colbert as Phil Ken Sebben, Reducto and others, and with Gary Cole as Birdman, this show has fast paced humor like very few shows do today.

The premise itself is comical - your favorite Hannah Barbera cartoon characters somehow wind up in court, with none other than Harvey Birdman as their defense attorney. Many jokes made in the show carry on to future episodes and the show itself will have you reminiscing like a quarterback at a high school reunion.

I never got the chance to watch this when it still aired on Cartoon Network late at night, with the exception of 1 episode ""Beyond the Valley of the Dinosaurs"", which led me to buy this DVD years later. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is that there were only 3 seasons, and unfortunately it looks like Colbert will too busy for a while with the Late Show to do a reboot.",1448928000,2,1012,4.377659574468085
