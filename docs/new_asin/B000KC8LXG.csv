8155547,4,B000KC8LXG,"This interview was tremendously interesting , not so much because of the way Updike spoke about his new book, but because of the way he spoke about his work, his lifetime effort, his fear of death. Updike tells Charlie Rose that as he has gotten older he has perhaps become somewhat less fearful of death. He says that he gets whatever consolation he can from his church but that he still fears.
Updike speaks about his life- work as a whole says when Rose asks him that he feels he has reached perhaps eighty- five percent of his potential.
Updike talks about his work habits, getting up early to write three or four hours each morning to push the manuscript forward three or four pages.
He speaks about being happy in his life , happy for a man of his age and time at what he has done and where he is.
In the discussion of the book it seems to me he shows a certain naivete in his creating a suicidal terrorist as somewhat sympathetic character.
On the whole this is a fine interview with one of America's great literary masters.",1197936000,,1031,4.375

And i ssit--here & 4 ahwile--never taking a stand--yet ever relating to someone who does.
