George (Andre Boudreau) is a former insurance salesman. His family was lost during the apocalypse and he lives in a fantasy world believing he is President in a rural Connecticut farmhouse. He lives with Saul Carter (Rich Tretheway) the owner of the farm who keeps his zombie family chained in the barn. Along the way they encounter friends and foes.
