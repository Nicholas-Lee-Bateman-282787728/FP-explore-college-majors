8751648,1,B01BVL0CG8,"I'm uncertain as to how to say this without being insulting to a subgroup of people reading this and, so, I apologize for any hurt feelings. This is a film about a man who suffers an inability to perform, sexually. It is meant to be a pornographic film, however, the story, by nature, only involves one scene in which the man in question can actually perform. There are scenes of nudity, of women primarily, and a seduction of the impotent lead by another man, but, again, there is only one curative scene, if you know what I mean. As pornographic films go, this is about as pointless as attempting to engage in sexual activity with a man suffering this condition when you absolutely have to get pregnant. There are far better options out there, if you are viewing this as pornography. If you are viewing it as a person hoping to find some kind of hopeful portrayal of dealing with this particular affliction, this may appeal to you. As a fan of all things Vinegar Syndrome, I don't see how this is even in their catalog. Aside from the nudity, there is nothing here for the average fan of that company's products. Good luck finding what is right for you.",1502496000,4,1155,4.504761904761905
