8253208,4,B0013XZ2WO,"Not sure why this is listed as from ""$499"" for the DVD.  It was a wonderful movie, but not that great.  I'm sure you can pick it up at a used DVD store.  Wonderful story about how the ""American Disabilities Act"" came into the mainstream, and a great performance by underrated actors like Ron Livingstone.  Rent it.  Stream it.  Just don't pay $500 for a DVD.",1488412800,,358,4.348484848484849
