8261133,3,B00166UKUM,"Here's a slight variation on the old theme of a group of people running into backwoods psychos.  We've seen this a million times before, and the only real difference here is that the modus operandi of the killers is to remove the feet of the female victims via axe.  The victims here are an all female L7-ish punk band.  The killers are a trio that consists of a bearded, skinny grease monkey type, and an Eminem lookalike who acts like a dog.  The ringleader is a soft spoken older gentleman, who in the Texas Chainsaw tradition, is either a father or father-like figure to the two younger guys.  This older guy is the one solely(pun intended) interested in the feet of the victims.
While derivative, this movie is strangely watchable.  I guess that I feel this way because A). I live in Wisconsin, where this film supposedly takes place, B) I'm a fan of this type of junk, and C) I have a foot fetish to boot(another rotten pun that's intended).  Hell, it almost seems to have been made for me!  Not really, but you know what I mean.  Even though there's a slight twist on the standard formula, in the end it's still the same old formula.  Definitely entertaining, certainly better than a swift kick in the ass, but not one you'll talk much about with anyone.  The ending is rather bad too.  I mean, it was all bad, but that CGI ending was a real groaner.
Worth checking out, but you can also live a long and happy life without having seen it too.",1316217600,,1449,4.406015037593985
8261134,4,B00166UKUM,"Not exactly profound, but it is fun. Hot looking girls and senseless violence. The guy who does the dogman act is actually very good. This movie also features a skinny dip scene in one of the grossest bodies of water I've ever seen, and I'm a fisherman from NJ.
There is a bonus scene that is included in the extras section that features a shoe store that I wish had been in the movie. It really would have added a cool and creepy element.",1296691200,,439,4.238095238095238
8261135,1,B00166UKUM,"If possible I would give this movie no stars. I try to give movies their due based on the type of movie it is. Well, this movie has no redeeming qualities!! I barely, I mean just barely, got thru it. I was tempted to turn it off many times. Bad acting, bad effects, bad directing, and did I mention bad acting! I tried, I really did try to like something about the DVD, but I threw it away as soon as I agonized my way thru it. Sorry, I never like to pan a movie like this.",1294876800,,473,3.88659793814433
8261136,2,B00166UKUM,Its not bad..but not good as well...so if i have known..i would not have bought it...i was fooled by the rating at amazon!!,1239494400,,123,4.391304347826087
8261137,4,B00166UKUM,"Didn't know what to expect when I grabbed this to rent the other day, I hadn't read about it in any magazines, or seen it on the net anywhere, and as someone who watches lots of Horror flicks, it's not unusual to get something that looks good, but then have it turn out to be one of the worst atrocities ever commited to film, this ain't one of them, this sounded cool when I picked it up, and it delivered! Obviously done by people with a passion for the genre, the female band was a nice new twist to an often told lost in the middle of nowhere story, if you enjoy your Horror with twisted comedy, cool gore, goofy killers, and great music, then check this movie out. The most entertaining new Horror movie that hasn't come out of France, that I've seen in quite some time, I will be buying it. I don't know how it slipped under my radar, but don't let it slip under yours. A nice treat for any old-school slasher fans and horrorpunks out there.",1213660800,,947,4.237569060773481
8261138,4,B00166UKUM,"I'm not a huge horror buff, but I really enjoyed this one.  It's grimier than a sick monkey's underpants and funnier than your drunk uncle's Macarena. If you like kitschy horror done with a ""do it yourself"" indie vibe, go pick this up.",1207180800,,235,4.465116279069767
8261139,4,B00166UKUM,"If you like the horror genre, you'll love this movie.  I don't really like horror films but my boyfriend took me to see this and he loved it.  It was way too intense/scary for my taste and I thought the nudity and sex was gratuitous, but I guess that's the point.  But if you like blood, gore and a bit of camp, this is definitely worth a look.",1207094400,,344,4.029411764705882
8261140,5,B00166UKUM,"10 years ago, Robbie Rist became engaged in a broad project to create a B-movie type horror film. The result of throwing in a lot of money, time, effort, and hard work, along with a literal ""cast of hundreds"" is the new Boathouse Productions film Stump the Band.

  The general plotline follows an all girl band on a low-budget tour. They ride in a solitary van, driven by the boyfriend of one of the members of the band. Their manager is also in tow. When said boyfriend ends up driving the car off the road and almost crashing in the dead of night (to find they are out of fuel anyway), the real journey begins.

  What makes this movie work is the combination of calculated cliche and studio craft. I entered the screening convinced I'd be Tom Servo-ing to death (a fashion moulded by the old TV show Mystery Sciene Theatre 3000, where three robots would ad-lib comments and make oblique references in order to make the best of a series of truly bad films featured in the series). Oddly, because the manner of the film was well planned and well executed, there was little break in which to apply the slathering of sarcasm and funny voices I'd expected.

  Well cast, and with a higher production value than I suspected (that is, it has the look of a quality production, though probably not anywhere near the budget), Stump the Band is a treat for anyone who wants to see a generic horror film taken to the next ridiculous level. There's gore, gratuitous nudity, profanity, and cliche after cliche. All of the characters fit into a classic B-movie archetype, yet the performances are really well done, and as stated before, the whole movie comes off as a fresh, and strangely comforting affair. The movie isn't as ""bad"" as it's creators reached for, yet it isn't so ""good"" that a given audience will mistakenly take it as a serious horror movie. A great place for any low-budget film to be.

  According to the introduction before the debut began, Stump the Band has already received awards at two Sci-fi/Horror conventions. Someone is watching and taking notice. Maybe others should follow their lead.
