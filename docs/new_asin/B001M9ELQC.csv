3694530,4,B001M9ELQC,"This set is a must for hardcore Van Damme fans.  It contains Hard Target, Lionheart, Sudden Death, and The Quest.  This set also replaces another, now out of print, Van Damme quadruple feature.  That set contained Hard Target, Street Fighter, The Quest, and Timecop.

So what makes this new set worthwhile?  Well, although none of the titles in this set are new to dvd, two of them have better presentations than their standalone versions.  First off, The Quest is available in anamorphic widescreen (the standalone version is non-anamorphic).  Secondly, and perhaps even more noteworthy, is the inclusion of an anamorphic widescreen version of Sudden Death.  Up until now, the only way to see this underrated gem in widescreen was on laserdisc.  Every American dvd release of this has had an atrocious pan and scan transfer.  In my opinion, these two presentations make the set a must have.

The only disappointing thing about this release is the presentation for Lionheart -- it's the same ""full frame"" transfer/stereo sound mix Universal has been using for years.  This movie really deserves better.  Unfortunately, the fact that they've re-mastered pretty much every other Van Damme movie they own besides this one tells me one thing: don't hold your breath waiting for a better version.",1236384000,42,1291,5.09047619047619
3694531,4,B001M9ELQC,"Jean Claude Van Damme. The man who can, among a myriad of other things, punch through a car window without the slightest laceration. The man who can take a bullet to the head and recover in a better frame of mind than before. The man who can defeat Kevin Costner for the most bare butt scenes in his films. Truly a god among men, Van Damme has both entertained and repulsed us for over two decades now.

Suffice it to say that I'm a major Van Damme fan, but what I love even more is saving money with these multi-disc sets! The four films here are spread across two single-sided discs, giving you over six hours of Van Damme doing what he does best - white knuckled, adrenaline pumping action! Oh yeah, and they typically have some semblance of a plot thrown in there somewhere.

HARD TARGET is my personal favorite of the films presented here, both because of its excellent premise lifted from the famous short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and its outstanding cast. Aside from Van Damme, we have the legendary Lance Henriksen and the old oats-hawker himself - Wilford Brimley.

Despite the file compression (two films crammed onto each disc), the films are entirely watchable though the picture quality is a bit below what we typically expect from a DVD. The films generally appear as if you're watching them on cable television, as the picture is a bit grainy with the occasional scratch here and there.

Also of special note is that while all the other films are presented in widescreen, LIONHEART is inexplicably presented here in fullscreen. Not a big problem for me, because while I always prefer widescreen, I certainly don't watch Van Damme films for their cinematography. . .",1235174400,21,1687,4.6891891891891895

3694596,4,B001M9ELQC,"For my money, this is a two good/two mediocre set, but worth the very decent price if you are a fan of Van Damme and want to see some quality action movie vehicles. You wouldn't be after these if you don't already realize what you are in for but, for my taste, the price alone makes this set a more than sustainable purchase. I will review each film separately in the set and offer my opinions:

""Hard Target"" (Universal, 1993, John Woo) -- 2 stars out of 5
Supposedly one of the ""better"" action pictures that starred Van Damme near the pinnacle of his movie career, I find ""Hard Target"" to be a nearly indigestible film. Personally, I don't care for the style of this film. I saw Woo's picture ""Windtalkers"" (with the dreadful Nicholas Cage starring) and found it to be one intense war picture in its bloody combat scenes. But in the earlier ""Hard Target,"" Woo has attempted to tailor himself to Van Damme, and I for one do not believe that this director's style is palatable to Western audiences. The slow motion techniques are annoying beyond toleration. Van Damme gets ONE good kick-butt scene near the beginning (in which he borrows an arm-breaking move from Steven Seagal) but otherwise this movie makes light of his typically tough marital arts scenes (which is why I watch Van Damme movies in the first place). Sadly, ""Hard Target"" begins pretty well and has an intense flair until the mid-point (with villains Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo making awesome adversaries here) but it quickly runs out of ideas near the mid-point, and the over-the-top set piece in the abandoned circus prop warehouse is ridiculous to me (not a great set piece in my opinion). For me, the action scenes weren't all that creative or groundbreaking, and I thought there would be more outdoor scenes and a longer chase at the end. Although Richard Connell (were he alive) should have been compensated for offering the germ for Pfarrer's screenplay, this movie has little to do with ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and is nearly as implausible as most other street action movies--but more so when all the silly action pieces are put together as a whole, and the plot itself is completely disregarded near the finish. If it weren't so silly it might have been tolerable, but for me it was a lot of effort wasted. Not that these movies deliver the kind of ""realism"" in action scenes that make them believable, but the idea of chasing down and shooting homeless guys all over the place is a little too far fetched even for me. While there are scenes that are passable in intensity, mostly the picture attempts to hang its over-the-top violence on a very thin plot. To me, the second half and the first half of the movie don't mix, and in the end all the effort just doesn't seem worthy of either Van Damme or his director. Which is all very unfortunate too because the film has a polished look and an obviously enthusiastic cinematic style, but its ambitions far outrun its eventual cinematic scope. I thought there would be more suspense, more mountain scenery, more hunting--I though the Van Damme character should have been ""hard to FIND"", not so easily tracked down. Instead of suspense, we end up with a powder keg in a clown factory. But taken on the whole as a non-stop action movie, ""Hard Target"" is fun to watch, even if mainly for its dynamic opening half.

""Lionheart"" (Universal, 1991, Sheldon Lettich) -- 3 stars out of 5
One may get a ""Hard Times"" flavor in the air when watching this one (but with a lot more heart at its center, even if it is in the end just another excuse for brutal martial arts damage). It's a fairly standard story with Van Damme kicking butt and (as usual) getting his own kicked several times in the process. A bit of a better script, but the finish is brutal--if one got kicked in the face or head like these guys do here, it's likely that one kick would kill a man dead in an instant if done correctly. But realistic violence isn't what these pictures are all about. If one watches ""Lionheart"" from first frame to last, it is a bit more of an emotional story for Van Damme, but to me it's not all that impressive, and as I said the last fight is overly brutal to be much fun in the way that ""Kickboxer"" turned out to be. Still, a better film than ""Hard Target"" (and ""Kickboxer"") in my humble opinion. If you are betting that ""Lionheart"" will be another routine Van Damme picture with little heart, well, then...WRONG BET!

""Sudden Death"" (Universal, 1995, Peter Hyams) -- 4.5 stars out of 5
Ironically, I am no sports entertainment fan, but without doubt ""Sudden Death"" is the finest film in this set. Not only does Van Damme have what are in my opinion his best fight scenes, but there is an awesome tidal wave of suspense running throughout the entire movie. Although Hyams (director of Connery's ""Outland"" and Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"") is considered by some to fall in line on the hack list (along with J. Lee Thompson, William Lustig, Lewis Teague, and a host of other significant genre greats), here he keeps the action running smoothly throughout, and does afford the star enough room to showcase his fighting abilities without compromising the truly unnerving plot (and yes, Powers Booth shines as the grim but grandstanding villain). Hyams actually photographs his own pictures too, and to call the man a stylist is a bit of an understatement. Whereas the other pictures in this set seem to run out of speed at midpoint, ""Sudden Death"" kept me interested until the rather original finish. Presented in Widescreen format finally, this is the opportunity to see Jean-Claude in a real movie with some really terrific violent action to back up his reputation. Now this is more like it!

""The Quest"" (Universal, 1996, Jean-Claude Van Damme) -- 3 stars out of 5
Opening with a ninety year old (or thereabouts) Van Damme defeating a couple of heathens in a barroom brawl (of sorts), ""The Quest"" is most likely going to be compared by film historians to Van Damme's other major picture ""Bloodsport""--the comparisons are obvious and at points unnecessary, as ""The Quest"" is a far more polished picture overall. Trouble is, there is too much unnecessary plot to this (including a nearly amusing role for ex-Bond Roger Moore, of all people) that we lose time that could have been spent upon these magnificent international (and inner ring) battles between martial arts opponents (which was the selling point of the picture anyways). I am not certain as to how much the real Frank Dux contributed to the story material, but he seems to have gotten upset with Van Damme to the point of having filed a suit against the studio (for his claims that Van Damme had ""ripped off"" an earlier script that Dux had written several years beforehand). The fight scenes are good, but there is a bit too much time spent in having to wait for them--and these fights are softened for the PG-13 rating, so no serious violence as was on display in classic marital arts showcases such as ""Bloodsport"". ""The Quest,"" to my eyes, was a last ditch effort by Universal to move Van Damme into the mainstream of American action pictures before allowing him to fade away into the specialized markets of direct-to-video timewasters...obviously, ""The Quest"" was no major hit for the man, but it looks better than many of his other films, and you can now judge in hindsight whether or not Van Damme was capable of doing more mainstream titles instead (although I think most can agree that he was going to be stuck in marital arts hell every time he stepped IN FRONT of the camera). It's a notable film for the incorporation of all of the unusual fighting styles and defensive techniques, but if you are looking for a serious kick-butt spectacle, ""The Quest"" has too many other ambitions for that one-sighted goal. But, for its beautiful landscapes and interesting concepts alone, it's worth a look, just don't expect anything spectacular (and the ending is nothing short of what you would expect).

Overall, if you are a Van Damme fan and don't yet own these films on disc, this is an essential purchase. Obviously, I am not as impressed with ""Hard Target"" as others are, but otherwise the rest of the pictures are quite good for what you get. And if you are an action movie fan, this can't be beat really. These Universal sets offer great picture and sound transfers, and as others have noted, only ""Lionheart"" is offered in standard pan-and-scan transfer (but it still looks good). These sets are more than affordable, and while I could gripe about the lack of extra content, why carp about a nice collection such as this?

I thought the set could've used some bonus material; namely stuff like deleted scenes for LIONHEART, SUDDEN DEATH and THE QUEST, if there are any to be found, production notes, cast and crew profiles, making of documentaries, theatrical trailers and tv spots and poster galleries, foreign and domestic. I said they should've had to included the original uncut version of ""HARD TARGET"" because obviously the movie had to be cut a dozen times to get an ""R"" rating in the USA. I also wish they would've included individual DVDs of each movie in the set, because apparently it was a 2 disc set with 2 films on each disc.

3694674,4,B001M9ELQC,"Although the themes and writing and directing styles of these nearly forgotten '70s westerns would keep me from grouping them in a single set, their production era binds them together well enough... well, enough that this collection seems somewhat less arbitrary than many others out there.  What I find most interesting here is the impressive stable of writers involved:

'Breakheart Pass' (screenplay by Alistair MacLean, based on his book) is a decent mystery-thriller, passably directed by Tom Gries ('100 Rifles,' 'Will Penny').  Bronson stars as an undercover federal agent rooting out a bizarre murder plot on board a train transporting medical supplies through the Rockies to a diptheria-plagued U.S. Army outpost.  Also features Ben Johnson and Richard Crenna.  A little unevenly paced and acted, but with nice location shots.  3-plus stars.

'Valdez Is Coming' (adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel) is a grim, spaghetti-ish revenge picture with Lancaster cast questionably as the eponymous Mexican-born sheriff.  Entertaining but doesn't quite hit the dramatic mark.  3-plus stars.

'Doc' (penned by newspaperman/novelist Pete Hamill) with Stacy Keach and Faye Dunaway is a strange, studied and often intriguing take on the Doc Holliday/Wyatt Earp legend.  Too disengaged to be truly compelling, but worth watching as an antidote to the usual Hollywood treatment of the subject matter.  3-minus stars.

'The Missouri Breaks' (co-scripted by an uncredited Robert Towne of 'Chinatown' fame) generally is considered one of director Arthur Penn's ('Bonnie & Clyde,' 'Night Moves') debacles, noteworthy solely for having Nicholson and Brando performing together on film for the first and only time (even composer John Williams' score tends to be dismissed as a throwaway).  The story and mood are typical within the revisionist mode, yes, and many object to Brando's ad-libbed lunacy as the flamboyant hired killer, but overall I find this the most nuanced and amusing of the set to revisit.  3 1/2 stars.

Two single-sided discs (Amazon incorrectly states one) are paired 'Breakheart'/'Valdez' and 'Doc'/'Missouri' and all four movies are anamorphic widescreen with no extras.  Prints, though unremastered, are acceptable in terms of color and image sharpness with the exception of 'Missouri,' which is perhaps (like its initial MGM DVD release) the worst major-studio digital transfer I've ever owned.  Content earns a soft 3-star average; smartly priced package bumps it closer to 4.",1319846400,9,2493,5.515789473684211
3694675,5,B001M9ELQC,"I bought this set for my father for his birthday. The movies come two to a dvd and both are on the front side of the disc. When the dvd turns on, you choose between which film that you would like to see. I appreciate this concept as my father who is a senior citizen can't always read the markings for dvd's that are reversible. He usually ends up watching the wrong movie that way... The movies were both in good condition and he has no trouble watching them...",1301270400,,462,4.202247191011236
3694676,4,B001M9ELQC,"This DVD set seems to be a test-bed for Universal Pictures, since all four of the included movies (Hard Target, Lionheart, Sudden Death, and The Quest) have NEVER seen a Blu-ray release. So, regardless of what I have to say -- if you want to be able to buy any of these movies in Blu-ray in the future, then buy this set. Period. You can't beat the price, and especially since most other individual DVD print runs of these movies no longer exist. Now that I said that, let's see what we actually get.

  HARD TARGET. The first American film directed by John Woo, but still contains his trademark style action choreography and inventive style of violence. Has some great performances from Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo. If you ever want to see a ""Director's Cut"" of this film which has been rumored over the years, then you need to buy and support this film collection. Maybe Universal will listen finally.
  SUDDEN DEATH. (first time in anamorphic widescreen) A very good action/thriller from director Peter Hyams (who also did the well-received Timecop), and co-stars Powers Booth. Defiantly worth the price of the collection as well.
  THE QUEST. (first time in anamorphic widescreen)Jean Claude Van Damme (directs for the first and last time) and Roger Moore (James Bond for 12 years) star in this rather simple ""martial arts tournament"" plot that really never captures the audience like Bloodspoot did, but there are a number of decent fights.
  LIONHEART is the weakest film in the bunch, not offering much in the way of action or memorable sequences. Its also the same ""Full Frame"" version with a stereo mix that you'll see everywhere else. Chances are that you haven't seen it in awhile, so it's still worth watching at least once.

The one major downside is the overall video compression (two films crammed onto one DVD9 disc), and since at least one film on each disc is over 90min, that means they needed to compress the data to make it fit on a single DVD layer. The films are still watchable, and the anamorphic helps, but the picture quality is defiantly slightly degraded compared to a standard DVD release. Still, other than that, its hard to complain since you can't find these movies on DVD individually in stores anymore. I know we all hate buying multiple releases, but if we support this ""collection"" then I really do feel that Universal may see fit in spending the money on a Blu-Ray master for these films. I wouldn't even mind if they were also in a ""collection"" like this one. (wink, wink)",1275264000,4,2517,4.739130434782608
3694677,3,B001M9ELQC,"This quadruple feature Van Damme ""fight pack"" is presented by Universal pictures and features four action flicks(from best downward),Time Cop,The Quest,Hard Target and Street Fighter. Instead of the dreaded double sided disc for these films Universal,thankfully,has placed two films on each disc. All of the films have been transferred nicely,are clear and crisp and they are presented in widescreen format. No extras are available.
""Hard Target""(released Aug/93)concerns the story of a sadistic businessman by the name of Emil Fouchon(Lance Henriksen) and his associate Pik Van Cleaf(Arnold Vosloo).They have been in many locales worldwide where they offer to set up actual hunting expeditions...for humans. They pay off coroners so no questions are asked and hire a local stooge to suss out the people they need;preferably with NO family,usually street people. This time the subject they last hunted HAD a family and now the daughter,Natasha Binder(Yancy Butler),has come looking for her father,a down and out ex vet. She enlists the help of a local unemployed ex vet Chance Boudreaux(Van Damme).At first he isn't interested as he has a job lined up,but when that falls through he agrees to help. Through alot of twist and turns the mystery the two start to uncover gets more bizarre and dangerous until they finally find the truth;and it isn't pretty. Fouchon does everything he can to stop Natasha and Chance and in the finale inside a warehouse filled with Mardi Gras floats and masks,Fouchon finally gets his comeuppance.
A nice story that falls a little flat in execution,but with a solid supporting cast. Henrikson and Vosloo give out some great menacing vibes. I give it a solid three stars.
""Time Cop"" concerns the story of Max Walker(Van Damme),a security man who's wife has been killed in an explosion as he leaves for work. One day he is offered a job in a newly created corps of personnel assigned to police time. This is appropriate as he eventually finds his wife's death was not as a result of a robbery but a hit for him. It seems a Senator McComb(Ron Silver)who is on the board over seeing the time police is seeking election as president. To finance his campaign he has enlisted the help of others to go back in time to steal money,such as a gold bullion shipment during the civil war or to make money out of the stock market crash of /29. Walker catches on to his scheme and goes back to stop his various time infractions. At the same time McComb realizes the threat Walker poses(the killing of his wife)and does everything he can to stop him. In the final showdown Walker manages to push McComb into himself,from an earlier time period,and kills him. He then goes back to the day of his wife's murder and manages to save her and his other self. Walker returns through the time portal and to his new life with his wife and a young boy he never had before.
A nice and very intriguing Sci Fi concept and Ron Silver cuts a mean and sadistic figure as Sen. McComb. I give this 3 1/2-4 stars.
""The Quest""(released April/96)is the story of Chris Dubois seen as an old man at the outset. He relates his story in a dissolve to his past in NYC of 1925. Being a deserted child from the streets himself he looks after a coterie of street kids with his job as a street performer;with mime make up walking on stilts. One day he and his charges rob a local thug of some substantial money and the thug comes a calling for it. He is forced to run from him and the police. He stows away on a ship which turns out to be a pirate ship. When they reach the south pacific the ship is attacked and boarded by an English mercenary by the name of Lord Dobbs(Roger Moore).Lord Dobbs in turns sells him to local tribesmen on an island off of Siam(Thailand)who teach him the ways of Muay Thai fighting. When he is ready they enter him in a fight and this is where he again meets Lord Dobbs. Impressed with his skills Dobbs buys him back and enrolls him in a tournament of the best fighters from around the world. Each fighter has a style unique to their training and the country they represent,such as Mongolia,Japan,Germany,Scotland,etc. Dubois faces down all his opponents and just before he fights the last contender,Dobbs tries to make off with the tournament prize;a solid gold dragon. He is caught and sentenced to death. Dubois offers to settle for his freedom instead of the prize. This is accepted and after a harrowing battle,Dubois emerges victorious.
An intriguing plot and story line but which fails to keep a good enough pace consistently throughout. Roger Moore as Dobbs does nice work and the cinematography is excellent. 3 1/2 stars.
""Street Fighter""(released Dec/94) concerns the story of the AN(Allied nations)security forces led by Colonel Guile(Van Damme).His United Nations-like forces,complete with blue berets,are up against a local war lord and arms dealer Sagat(Wes Studi)and a crazed man,one self appointed General Bison(Raul Julia)from Shadaloo, who if he doesn't get his billions of dollars worth of ransom,will kill hostages he has taken and hold the AN accountable. Guile enlists the help of two friends Ryu(Byron Mann)and Ken Masters(Damian Chapa)and,working separately,a lady by the name of Chun-Li(Ming-Na Wen),to infiltrate Bison's lair. Through Sagat's domain then into Bison's territory the three manage to throw things off kilter enough so Col. Guile can launch a head on attack at their under ground lair deep in the jungle. The ultimate showdown between Guile and Bison comes and goes and Bison and his hideout are destroyed...or are they?
Based on the old video game Street Fighter 2(which I played alot),the movie is terribly weak in plot. Even though it never takes itself seriously the jokes are more than juvenile. Raul Julia unfortunately was still getting over the effects of food poisoning and looks terribly gaunt in this film. In October of /94 we lost talented Raul when he succumbed to a brain hemorrhage at age 54. The film  has a dedication to Raul at the end of the film and it's a shame this was his last film role. I give it 2 1/2 stars.
In conclusion I think this two disc set is a great and cheap way to obtain some of Van Damme's better action films. It's a no extra package of course and ""Street Fighter"" is the clunker of the pack,but overall you should be pleased with what you see.",1272844800,2,6339,4.783759124087592

3694679,5,B001M9ELQC,"THE QUEST

Jean Claude Van Damme (who also wrote & directed) and Roger Moore (a former James Bond) star in this surprisingly PG-13 action-adventure film. Not as good as the others in this collection, though.

SUDDEN DEATH

Jean Claude Van Damme stars in this action/suspense thriller from director Peter Hyams (""Timecop""). Powers Booth co-stars. Very well written. Arguably the best film in this collection, along with ""Hard Target.""

LIONHEART

Inexplicably in fullscreen, this hard hitting actioner stars Jean Claude Van Damme.

HARD TARGET

This John Woo directed action thriller stars Jean Claude Van Damme, Arnold Vosloo (who would later play ""The Mummy"" & ""The Mummy Returns"") and Lance Henriksen (a police detective in ""The Terminator""). Very good action thriller. My only complaints were that about 20 minutes have been cut from the film AND the graphic shot of a snake biting a villain is too damn gruesome, even for me.",1244937600,10,929,5.153333333333333
