8337955,4,B001RHGRQQ,"you can see comedians as they were rising stars way back in the early nineties. If you are young, this maybe the first time you see these artists do their thing. If you are on the older side, you may have seen these routines & you will can see them again & laugh like it's the first time.",1362096000,3,288,3.9827586206896552
8337956,5,B001RHGRQQ,"This DVD is a comedy BARGAIN, and a MUST for any comedy collection! You get 8 hours of comedy videotaped back in the 80's and 90's from comedians that were unknown back then.  Dice Clay, Rogan, Schimmel, Jeni, Romano, Behar, O'Donnell, Reeb (Uncle Lar), Basile, John Mendoza, etc.  Most of the performances were recorded at the famous 'Rascals' comedy club in West Orange, NJ, and almost nobody holds back anything here.  Lots of expletives, raunchy humor, etc. Utterly hilarious!",1297641600,2,480,5.050632911392405
8337957,4,B001RHGRQQ,"Very very amusing. Some performers better than others, but all very funny and worth watching again.",1268265600,3,99,5.25
