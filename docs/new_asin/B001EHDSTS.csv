3554649,5,B001EHDSTS,"Ned's is one of my favorite shows, and i've already watched this season two set 3 times in the past month. the set comes with the entire season two and the episode quality is very nice.",1365465600,2,185,4.166666666666667
3554650,5,B001EHDSTS,We loved this show when it was airing on Nickelodeon so I knew we needed to own the DVDs. I just wish they had more than two seasons on DVD. There are so few shows as good as this one.,1360627200,2,184,3.625
3554651,5,B001EHDSTS,"This show was one of Nickelodeon's best. Very funny and unlike some NICK shows today it was completely age appropriate and had nothing that made parents cringe. Season 2 of Ned's Declassified aired from 2005-2006 and followed Ned and his friends through their 7th grade year in middle school. Just a fun show to watch; filled with wacky and wild antics and some pretty useful tips for kids in middle school as well. This is actually the complete 2nd season(not one of Amazon's ""best of"" DVDs) but it was released only in Canada(along with Seasons 2 and 3 of Zoey 101) but now a few copies are making their way into the United States. Disappointing that Nick cancelled this show after just 3 seasons but thanks to a DVD company in Canada the entire series is available on DVD.",1316131200,8,775,4.58273381294964
3554652,5,B001EHDSTS,"This will not play on a newer computer. It would not play on my Vista machine with either my LG DVD writer or my Sony Blu-Ray player, due to the hardware anti-copy provisions. It will play on my XP machine, but only in my older DVD player, not my LG DVD burner. The DVD player is old enough to not have those damned restrictions.
NOTE: I finally switched my older machine to Ubuntu Linux, with the same results.
The video quality is excellent, equal to commercial DVDs. The disk art and packaging are as good as commercial DVDs as well. And the show itself is great, very funny and good-natured. Well worth buying, I hope enough people do that Amazon releases the rest of the episodes.",1232755200,4,685,4.444444444444445
3554653,5,B001EHDSTS,"With the deal struck between Nickelodeon and Amazon, we finnaly have various titles being released that I thought we would never see. Thank you Amazon! Now if only you could strike the same deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment and get titles like X-Men, Spiderman, MMPR, and Digimon in Region 1 boxsets. I would gladly pay my hard earned money for titles like that.",1222819200,,369,4.78125
3554654,5,B001EHDSTS,"I am 40 yrs. old and I love this show. It reminds me of a combination of Warner Bros. cartoons, old slapstick and screwball comedies. It's so good to see this show finally get the dvd treatment. There are only 8 of the 20 episodes of season 2 and they are 1)New Semester/Electives 2)Pep Rallies/Lunch 3)Your Body/Procrastination 4)Valentine's Day/School Websites 5)Asking Someone Out/Recycling 6)April's Fool Day/Excuses 7)Secrets/School Car Wash & 8)Spirit Week/Clothes. The transfers are beautiful and as good as could be hoped for. I know a lot of people will not want to buy this because it's not a complete season. Since they are only producing this on demand it is vitally important to purchase and let Amazon know that Ned's Declassified is wanted and should be released completely. The more they sell, the more likely they will be willing to release the rest. Now, hopefully, on to Season 3!",1222646400,18,899,4.960264900662252
3554685,5,B001EHDSTS,"It's been a while since I last saw this show. All I have to say, is that if you ever run into problems in school, as ironic as it may seem, this show really does help (not really!) just kidding, this show remains in the heart of the 90's kids and anyone who was a preteen at this time.

3554691,5,B001EHDSTS,Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide is one of my favorite shows ever. I remember watching it when I was younger and related to a lot of the material. It really is just a goofy show with some unexplainable hijinks thrown in the mix. I would recommend this to the young and the old. It has great tips and a wonderful cast. The only down side is that season 3 never came out on dvd so I have to figure out some other way to get my fix.,1430870400,2,437,4.0344827586206895
