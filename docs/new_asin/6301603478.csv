335125,4,6301603478,"New capture of the horror film classic, this version is sometimes regarded as an attempt to cash in on Andrew Lloyd Webber's broadway production. However Duke Sandefur's script is highly original and well done, he creates the phantom as part of the opera ""Faust"" which is used in this version and many other versions. Director Dwight H. Little also captures some good and terrifying moments. For the most part, Robert Englund is the phantom, Erik Destler, a music artist who sold his soul to the devil for the world to love his opera talents. Unfortunatly the devil mutilated his face and the phantom then gets supernatural powers and haunts the London Opera House. Christine (Jill Scholen) is in present day New York looking for a piece of music to sing to get an audition for a broadway production, she comes across Erik's music and once she sings it, she is sucked back to 1881 London and is the understudy of the opera's Diva Carlotta, and the phantom coaches her to be the new star. Along the way, the phantom skins the stagehand, he takes on three thieves and even kills an opera critic in a sauna that critized Christine's performance. The film is somewhat bloody, but the film captures some impressive scenes including Christine at the graveyard, the phantom's lair, the masked ball and the opera house is very luxorious as well. Unfortunatly this version does not have the classic falling chandlier, but the unmasking is different, instead of a mask, the phantom ripps apart his face, and Christine also does it again at the end of the film, (two scenes which are very hideious). Misha Segal's music score is by far the best for any phantom film so far. His music for Don Juan Triumphant is magical, and his scores for the title theme, and the murder scenes are suspensful and terrifying. Bill Nighy, Terence Harvey, Stephanie Lawrence, Nathan Lewis and Peter Clapham all co-star. Also look for Molly Shannon (Saturday Night Live) in a small role in the present day New York City sequences as Christine's friend.",1045267200,14,2021,4.793696275071634
335126,4,6301603478,"As your run-of the mill horror/slasher movie this film kicks some serious behind. As a version of Phantom...look out for the pitchfork weilding purists. Erik Desler is one of those deformed-latter-on-in-life-Phantoms. Howver it is not by acid for a change. Instead he makes a deal with Satan to have his music live forever. Apparently somwhere a wire got crossed and he got immortality for himself, no recognition for his music and all the flesh peeled from his face. To cover his deformities he is forced to kill and skin people every few days. In one of the more graphic scenes you actually get to witness his removing his face, though I thought this scene was very nicely done from an artistic standpoint. Unfortunetlythe story does not take place in Paris, but in England. One of the more violent of the Phantom genre, this movie is still a much-watch for any phan with a strong stomach, especially those who hate Carlotta...",1038700800,4,929,4.8125

Since early childhood I've been weaned on it), but they're pretty obscure.  The portrayal of Christine was rather good, but I do NOT like what they did to Erik.  First of all, I have a hard time imagining him with a prostitute(!) and in the book, his Don Juan Triumphant meant so much more than a vehicle to make him famous.  I believe this movie to *not* be for Phantom  lovers, but it's GREAT for horror movie fans.  In that respect, I really enjoyed it.",1032048000,,603,4.2368421052631575

I'd seen trailers for this film way before getting into scary/ slasher movies. After checking out several slasher movies franchises- some modern others older) I found this one, and decided to try it. For fans of the musical, suspend everything you know from that one.
If R E being in it isn't enough indication, this one is a lot more gruesome and graphically violent. Being a scary movie fan won't hurt, but it's better to take this one on its own terms, because title notwithstanding, this is very much, ""its own story"".

335403,4,6301603478,"I doubt that there is anywhere in the world you could go to now without someone there knowing the story of the phantom of the opera. What began as a short novel by author Gaston Leroux in 1909 was first turned into a film in 1916 though that version has been lost. Perhaps the more famous first version came via the extraordinary make up from its star Lon Chaney in 1925. The visage that he unleashed upon the film going public at the time was the one most often thought of until Andrew Lloyd Webber chose the novel for his musical back in 1986. That version came about when the original story went into public domain and could be used by anyone. What many may not realize is that at the same time a few scriptwriters were working on their own version for the same reason even though that film would not come out until 1989. That film came and went without a ton of recognition, many thinking it was trying to play off of the musical. In point of fact it was stepping back to the original source material and does so quite well.

The film opens in present day (1989 that is) and young Christine Day (Jill Schoelen) is off to perform an audition for a musical on Broadway. During that audition she is bumped on the head and wakes to find herself transported to 1881 London where she is the understudy to the lead diva at the recently renovated London Opera House. When the diva takes ill, Christine performs the piece she was to do and is about to take over the part. Alas the diva prevents this from happening much to the displeasure of the phantom of the opera house, a mythical ghost type figure all fear but few have ever seen.

Even though few have seen this phantom he does indeed exist. The story is that Erik Destler (Robert Englund) sold his soul to the devil in order for his music to be made famous. While his music does indeed get recognized the devil disfigured him in return so that only his music would be loved. In an effort to appear normal, Destler sews on pieces of skin to his mangled flesh one piece at a time. Now Destler haunts the halls and secret passages of the opera house waiting for the day someone he believes in can perform his music. That day is now and Christine is that person.

When people begin to push Christine out of the picture bad things begin to happen to various members of the cast and crew. A stagehand is hung, the diva is silenced and all fear that in the end the phantom will have his way. As Christine falls under the charms of her benefactor she falls for someone else, a young man who will do all he can to protect her. But if the phantom has his way Christine and his music will always remain with him.

Eventually Christine wakes to find herself in the present once again and in line for the part. One would think that the story ends there but it doesnt and those who stop the movie there miss some of the best surprises left for them by the writer and director.

So why didn't this movie make a mint? After all, the film versions seen before always seemed to do so well at the box office. As I said the fact that the musical had already come out and was such a huge hit made it seem like this film was riding their coattails. With the popularity of the musical it was hard not to think of it or its music when this film came out. And thats sad.

Its sad because this is actually a very good version of the story. Not only that but the quality of the production would make you think there was some major money involved in this film. This was due in part because the producer of the film had several sets still standing from a previous film that had a higher budget that were put to use here. But its not just the sets that make this film stand out.

The performances seen in this film are outstanding. Englund had already been typecast as a bad guy by the time this movie had come out, forever known as Freddy Krueger of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET fame. But hes a much better actor than people give him credit for. This movie shows that off from start to finish. Schoelen also turns in a notable performance here as the ingnue whose mentor is not what he seems. The only bad thing to say about Schoelen is that she made too few films. After watching this one you may agree.

Shout Factory has done a great job with this release, another notch in their cap. The quality of the transfer to blu-ray retains the solid job of cinematography that was on display when the film was originally released back in 1989. The extras offer a glimpse behind the scenes as to what went on then and contains several interesting interviews with the cast and crew shot more recently. Its always nice to be able to revisit a movie like this with the original people today.

If you love the story of the phantom and have enjoyed the musical Id say you just might enjoy this film as well. Certainly there is a bit more gore to be had here but the story lends itself to that. Its nothing that would compare to what we now see on TV shows like THE WALKING DEAD but for the faint of heart the sewing scenes might be a bit much. Horror fans will love it though and be glad that this version is out there waiting for them to add to their collection. Another must have for those folks.",1427068800,3,5205,4.254802831142568

335407,1,6301603478,"Atrocious 1989 telling of the classic horror tale is actually better than Dario Argento's 1998 version, but that's about the only compliment I can pay it.  The disastrous miscasting of the leads would have been too much for the film to overcome even if everything else worked.  Jill Schoelen is a pleasing enough actress but she makes for a completely unconvincing opera singer and when the action moves from its present day prologue to the Victorian period in which the story is traditionally set she couldn't possibly seem more out of place.

Robert Englund is far worse as The Phantom.  As an actor if that word can even be applied to what Englund does here he brings nothing whatsoever--no artistic passion, no sense of tragedy, no romantic longing--all he has to offer are small bits of warmed over Freddy Krueger that are entirely inappropriate for this role.  Bill Nighy who plays an opera backer is 100 times the actor that Robert Englund is and might have made for a more interesting Phantom.

This version also tries to add some 1980's style slasher gore which isn't a bad idea in theory but the filmmakers never figure out a way to smoothly incorporate the gore into the story--it feels as shoe-horned into the material as the badly cast American leads.  Helmer Dwight H. Little was far outside of his element and clearly much more comfortable directing Steven Seagal in Marked for Death and Brandon Lee in Rapid Fire--he appears to be wasting some pretty decent production values with a shooting style entirely devoid of atmosphere.  This Phantom of the Opera looks more like a cheap made-for-tv movie than a proper theatrical film--everything is flat, over-lit and ugly, possibly so the gore effects would be extra easy to see but gothic horror is meant to be bathed in shadows, not filmed like an episode of Magnum P.I..

This version of The Phantom of the Opera is an incoherent disaster in spite of the familiar source material that survived Woody Woodpecker and Brian DePalma but not Freddy Krueger.  It's almost impossible to imagine after watching this but an even worse adaptation was still to come.",1425686400,2,2119,4.8448753462603875

Then an accident occurs which knocks Christine unconscious and brings her back to a past life. The story is basically told in a ""Wizard of Oz"" format that works out surprisingly well, when you consider the theme of the movie.

The gruesomeness, though, occurs when the phantom kills the people who get in the way of Christine's rise to stardom. Some of the gruesomeness, however, comes off as darkly humorous such as; what happens at the Masquerade Ball. (Not going to spoil what happens)Now, Robert Englund's acting is pretty much on par with Freddy Krueger (for those of you who are familiar with Englund)but some of the other actors could've been better. That, however, did not stop this movie from being enjoyable at all.

If you're looking for ALW's musical or a novel faithful version of the Phantom of the Opera then don't pick this movie up. If you're open minded and are looking for a different take on the phantom and have a rather dark sense of humor, look no further.",1351209600,,1475,4.604562737642586
335612,4,6301603478,"I saw this by accident when I was little once, and I remembered it scared me half to death. However, now that I'm older, I;m able to understand the story behind this film. I'm a big 'Phantom of the Opera' fan, and while I tend to lean toward Andrew Lloyd Webber's version, the original story it still interesting.

This film did a magnificent job of capturing Gaston Leroux's original tale and adding a unique spin on it.  Robert Englund was ridiculously amazing as The Phantom. He was frightening to everyone else he cam in contact with, yet caring towards the things he loved most: his music, and Christine.  I actually found myself sympathizing with him because of the hell he went through.

What I enjoyed most, however, was the ending. Obviously, I can't say much about it, but I feel like it ended on a creepy note, giving you a sense of ""this is not the end...."" and it was amazing!

Be warned.  This is far from Webber's romantic tale of a masked musical genius lurking beneath the opera house.  This is a horror film, and because of that, The Phantom's physical deformity is highlighted throughout!  On that note, the makeup was marvelous!!! Kevin Yagher did a fantastic job, and I found myself getting creeped out at times!!!",1341187200,3,1235,4.63302752293578
335613,4,6301603478,"This adaptation of the Gaston Leroux novel is compelling even if slightly disconcerting.  ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has always been one of my favorite works of fiction.  Telling the story of a deformed yet gifted man who desperately longs to be ""loved for his own sake,"" we recognize such universal themes as the longing for exceptance despite our flaws, sacrifice, and obsession.  The film starring Robert Englund focuses more on the macabre than the themes of the original story.  Nevertheless, there are some redemptive qualities to this movie version that make it worth watching.  I will innumerate the qualities that made this film likable for me:

1.  Robert Englund's portrayal of Erik, (the Phantom), was mesmerizing.  I am unfamiliar with the ""Freddy Kruger"" character, so I've never seen this actor in any other film.  I found his portrayal of Erik to be very faithful to Leroux's book.  He vividly portrayed the obsessively malevolent yet oddly sympathetic character of Erik.  Englund's voice is mesmerizing, and I loved his scenes with the actress portraying Christine.
2.  This movie version contains the ""graveyard scene"" that appears in the original work.
3.  The Faustian theme is particularly compelling in this version.  We as viewers see an ordinary man surrender to evil forces that literally condemn him to physical and mental corruption.  The evil contageon slowly burrows its way into Erik's soul, and we see a true child of Satan emerge before our very eyes.  Sometimes, getting what you want comes with a horrible price.

There were some aspects of this film that were off-putting.  The time-travel premise seemed ludicrous to me, and the ending of the film seemed rushed and contrived.  Also, do not expect a romantic tragedy or much redemption for the characters.  However, if you are looking for a new twist on the classic story that still maintains aspects of the original work, then I would recommend at least giving this film a chance.  God bless you all.",1337212800,,1987,5.015290519877676
335614,3,6301603478,"I'm torn here. I don't recommend this to anyone wanting to see a film version of the Phantom of the Opera after seeing the play and wanting to get into the story more. This version has no connection with the novel "" The Phantom of the Opera "" by Gaston Leroux whatsoever. Instead of the gothic romance of the story, we literally get ""Freddy Kruger of the Opera"" in this version. ( makes you understand why Robert Englund is the Phantom). The film is turned into a very bloody slasher film. Not something I'd recommed.  If you like Horror films, and want to check it out, do so at your own risk.  It is bloody, so please be warned.

However, that aside, I do like the look of the film. The romantic Candle lit look is very much present here. There is one thing here I wanted them to put in the ALW movie version but it didn't happen. In this version the phantom lures Christine to the graveyard by playing the violin. THe phantom is shown in shadow wearing the fedora and playing a haunting violin solo. THis is something I wanted them to put into the 2004 movie. Plus, Webber's score does contain a violin solo at that part so it would have made sense to include a scene like that.  Anyway, that scene is a major plus, I also liked the masquerade outfit for the Phantom. Very much like the stage show version, just not as over the top. Its more Maroon than bright red, and the skull mask actually has a rotting look to it.  VERY GOOD!

Its hard for me to fully not recommend this version due to the positive parts of this movie.  It is however very graphic, and not based on the actual story. If you are wanting a version close to the book, avoid this movie. If you liked the Webber musical and just want to read or see any adaptation of the story, then I'd recommend giving it a try, just be cautious in viewing. Not recommended if there are any kids around the house younger than 18.",1327968000,,1885,4.2633053221288515

If I could give it less stars I would ""0"" is the true number of stars this film deserves.

335716,5,6301603478,"I'm a big Phantom fan; I've read the book several times (my favorite work of fiction), seen the performances, and viewed at least 5 or 6 different versions, including Dario Argentos (who's version is, by far, the worst ever).  This one is one of my favorites in part because it features Mr. Englund, who is an excellent actor and make-up artists.

WARNING: Potential spoiler!!

This version is a bit twisted; without giving too much away, the Phantom has sold his soul to the devil, and is now seeking out Christine to make his music immortal, falling in love with her.  He is deformed, and uses the skin of his victims to cover his deformities (poorly, of coarse).  As usual in Phantom versions, he commits several murders to avenge her or aid her mission, but this is particularly fun in that there are some supernatural powers the phantom has and incorporates in his ""seduction"" and the murders.

Of coarse, the best parts of the movie are when you get to see Mr. Englund remove the skin and show his true deformities.

OK, the potential spoilers have passed:

The Woman who plays Christine is an actual singer and sings all of the parts, and while her acting isn't always the most interesting, she's true to the character.  And her voice is excellent!  She plays the delicate protagonist well, and seems to move from the stereotypical damsel in distress to a slightly stronger person through the movie.

Mr. Englund's performance throughout is excellent; facial expressions, make-up, deliverly of the lines, even the way he holds himself is very good; you can go from one moment hating the man, to pitying him the next.  Not all phantoms can deliver that sort of reaction.

The only negative criticism is that some of the British accents really do suck (MEG!) and some of the acting is over-the-top cheesy or bad (""Who is this man?  I must know!"" is jst so poorly delivered.)

Dwight Little director of Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick uses style and technique with fantastic Sets to create a time-period Gothic horror film both true to Gaston Leroux and upping the ante of the original horror film Phantom of the Opera. Robert Englund is restrained and delivers one of his best overall performances since his appearance in V the original Mini-series. Bill Nighy of Underworld fame delivers a solid performance, interesting to see him over ten years younger. The weakest but somehow adequate performance comes from Jill Schoelen who was in the early-nineties a bit of a scream queen.

335722,2,6301603478,"Genuine curio piece for Horror buffs updates story with added perversion and explicit violence. It seemed a good idea to cast one of the few actual Horror actors in the lead role, in this case Freddy Kruger himself, Robert Englund. His performance is what makes the film interesting ranging from the effective to the hammy and often times reflecting on his earlier screen creation.

The film is burdened by unneccesary additions to the original story, namely the Phantom having to use pieces of human flesh sewn together to create a mask(underneath he looks alot like Freddy Kruger) and a ridiculous tie to Jack the Ripper, which makes the film fall flat.
It's the level of gore and the inconsistent plot that makes the film hard to take seriously, that combined with uninteresting performances by a boring cast including the heroine of The Stepfather, Jill Schoelen, who unfortunately does not have a gratutious shower scene like that earlier film, leaving the audience to focus on her acting, which isn't that great.

Very little is inspired in this movie from either the Gaston Leroux novel or earlier film versions, even leaving out the chandelier scene!

The final ""twist"" is about as lame as it gets,and pretty forced, trying to meld a Faustian theme of the Phantom having sold his soul and obtaining eternal life into the present day. It dosen't work because the romantic elements, so crucial to this story, are completely absent as the filmmakers played it trendy and made a Slasher movie out of a classic.

Obviously if your a film fan, get the definitive version with Lon Chaney Sr. from 1925. That one still packs a wallop. Hell, even get the Claude Rains version from 1943.

The setting is modern-day New York.  Promising opera singer Christine Day (Jill Schoelen) is auditioning for an important producer when a stage accident catapults her back to 19th-century London.  She's still Christine, an aspiring soprano, yet haunted by the terrifying Phantom (Englund), a deformed composer who wears a mask stitched from the skins of his human victims.

The time-twisting theme works well to bookend the story, and Jill Schoelen is a luminous presence as both incarnations of Christine (her singing is dubbed by Nancy Fontana).  Robert Englund is quite chilling yet imbues his role with a dark comedy streak.  The late great Stephanie Lawrence is also memorable playing Carlotta, the resident opera diva.

I am an obsessive PotO Phan, so this movie in regards to being a tragic tale of romance and passion was a huge disapointment. It turned out to be completely lust on Erik's part, and quite well taken care of at that (He didn't really need Christine). Before watching it the first time, knowing it was a blood-and-guts slasher I decided NOT to make any comparisons of the romances portrayed in any other version, but I couldn't help but feel extremely dissapointed in that aspect.

As a horror, this movie hits near the top of most gory movies I have seen, up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the story istelf and the characters had little to no developement. The one part I enjoyed was when the Phantom acted like the Phantom is supposed to, enraptured in the gentle embrace of Christine's voice (of which there was very little); but right after that he went out and randomly killed some more people.

All this movie was was a lot of blood and guts with a famous title on it to make it seem better than it was.

I have to admit the effects where amazing, and the makeup immaculate, however, in real life there would be a lot of scar tissue over a wound like that, and it would not bleed buckets of fresh blood everytime he aired his wounds. Especially since it was so... clean when he wore ""makeup.""

The time-paradoxes really bothered me too, as does the fact that very very little is explained at all, such as WHY he's obsessed with Christine, WHY he goes all ninja in the alleyway, and WHY he goes through the painful process of reconstructing his face every day instead of just wearing a freakin mask.

I liked the red death costume. I didn't like the red death mask. But that's just me, and has nothing to do with the rating of the film. I didn't like it, but you might. At any rate, if you're looking to expand your experiances or maybe just your collection of the Phantom, I would reccomend it, if you can get a good deal on it.",1175990400,,2037,4.347368421052631

As for Christine rejecting the 'Phantom'?  In this version, I think it's just to add to the effect.  But it all goes back to that saying that ultimately you WILL give the devil his due.  Basis of a lot of saying, such as, ""If you want to dance, you'll have to pay the piper.""  ...And so much more....

Just watch it, and see the Phantom's own regret (terrifically played,) that he sold his soul to the devil for eternal existence of his music - at this price of love...  Yes, he is eternal and alive - to regret it, having fallen in love with Christine.

Oh... my God!  I had never found myself so disgusted and humored by this retelling!  So I have dubbed this movie my guilty pleasure of sorts.

We have Christine Day, an aspiring girl who wishes to get her role as a ""big star"" in a new musical.  Upon a visit to her friend's book-retail shop, she is shown an opera called ""Don Juan Triumphant"".  The composer's name is Erik, and it's frighteningly written in blood--she doesn't know that, however.  Until when she is singing it softly, does she discover that blood oozes out from the pages onto her hands.  And the next moment, it's no longer there.

And when she sings it at the tryouts for this ""new musical"", a prop falls from overhead, crashes into the mirror behind her, transporting her into the past--late 1800's, past.

And then we got the Phantom, who is played by Mr. Freddy Krugger himself.  What was seriously on the ""gross"" factor, was the ""mask"" he wore.  He wore no mask as in the different retellings, but uses the ol' Hannibal Lector trick.  Seawing pieces of his skin on his face, then covering it up with make-up.  Giving him a look somewhat of a cross between Gerard Butler's makeup and over-packed Stage-Makeup.  And he went around, in the open--some of the time--and kills people in the most nastiest of ways.  Joseph Buquet, however, was hung upside down in the fly-space, then dropped, then pulled up and had a knife dragged from his navel to his nose.  Honestly, it's Phantom all right, but terribly and horribly off his rocker.

The story of the Phantom's deformity has changed, he recieves his ugliness by selling his soul to the devil.  With his burning passion for becoming disfigured, he uses his musical genius and influences the Christine Day of the past/future with it.  One of the most beautiful scenes, that is a mixture of Leroux and lovely cinematography is the visit to the graveyard.  Of course, there is a Raoul, only he is called Charles.  The Phantom appears to Christine with a violin, playing away at it, giving Christine the impression it IS her father.

There are also some really funky scenes in the movie, too.  As in after the Masquerade/Red Death scene, he throws Christine down on his bed, jumps up and down on her--grinding her.  It's so bizzare and funny, you have to laugh.  And before that, let's not forget the famous prositute scene where he says in her ear, ""tonight, you are Christine..."" and he does her.  It's clearly something you could have seen Erik doing, only if he was that desperate.

I am not, however, ruining the ending for you.  That is something you will have to watch for yourself.  It's clearly one of those, ""what the holy..."" kind of reactions though.  But you knew it was coming, since Freddy Krugger always comes back.  But I will say that she comes back to the present, though.

In all, besides for the graphic killings, the explicit scenes, it's not that bad.  It's a guilty pleasure, if you are looking for a real ""slasher"" Phantom story, this one is right up your alley.  Though rent it first from your local video store, your decision on whether to buy it can be made like so.  I don't regret buying it, however.  :)",1132963200,,3634,4.544753086419753

335890,4,6301603478,"This is the little phantom that could. I saw this film when it first came out in 1989. The trailer blew me away. I think they spent more money on that trailer than the actual production itself. It was so spell binding! I begged my mother to take me. Being a phantom fan herself of the Lon Chaney version, she agreed. When we got to the theater, the lines were long and the auditorium was packed! After all this was the newest film version to date. It was important. I already read the book by Gaston Leroux. I also couldn't wait to see Robert England in the title role.

Say what you will about this gory retelling: it's another Nightmare on Elm Street. That's what my mother said. The film itself has some great points:

This is the first time we see Robert England so much more than a disfigured child killer. Finally he is aloud to cut away from his type cast role and show the audience what he can really do. In a word: Brilliant. England is a truly brilliant actor. You can see he tried very hard not to sound or act like Freddy. He pulled it off. He was wonderful in the scene where he is tutoring Christine in her chamber roaming through all her mirrors. I loved the scene where England and Christine are in his underground layer and how England says his masterpiece Don Juan Triumphant is incomplete; perhaps Christine will prefer to hear Mozart. He is excellent at the end of the film when he as the Phantom pretends to be a New York yuppie and main backer of his own work. It makes you wonder how the Phantom in the novel would act in the modern day. The film brings up a good point: Could plastic surgery save him, even if he has to do it himself with his own scalpel?

This adaptation pays much more homage to the novel than any of the others to date except the Lon Chaney version:

The Phantom truly has a death's head much like a skeleton head. We see this in the scene where he removes the skin from his face and his wig and his teeth and his nose.

It has the ballroom scene where the Phantom dresses like red death.

It has the killing of Joseph the rope guy, only much more graphic.

It has the rat man who is in the novel scaring the rats away. We didn't see him the Webber version.

Most important, this film has one scene not seen in any other version before it. It has the scene where Christine tries to escape the Phantom's layer only to find her back where she started.

It's too bad this version doesn't have the famous chandelier scene. It would have been much better if it did.

It was a bold decision to have the Phantom cover his face with sewn pieces of skin rather than a mask, but it works. It makes sense for the Phantom to skin his victims and wear the skin yet he has to keep doing it because the skin rots on his face after awhile and then needs replacing with fresh skin.

This film shows Robert England is a true actor and his talents have been wasted over the years mostly playing the same character of Freddy over and over again. Behold! He can play more than one role!

So, there you have it or there you skin it. As the Phantom says ""you can never leave here,"" to Christine, you cannot ignore this film. You can choose love or music or Robert England or Michael Crawford. Just never forget this is a Phantom movie.

One more thing: In the novel, Christine and the Phantom both disappear without a trace. Christine does not simply die like in the Webber version. That's probably why the screen writers decided she should be brought back through a time warp to where she began and the Phantom goes through the same time warp to be with her in the present day. It gives an explanation of how she disappears in the first place. The Phantom goes through the time portal to be with her again.",1111104000,,3728,4.263456090651558

335963,2,6301603478,"OK, probably everybody knows the story of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and there exists number of movies with different interpretations. The reason why I do not like this version is that it makes no sense - first of all, why should be the phantom portrayed as the most vicious killer in the world? He is defenitely not this kind of a person. Yes, he has the anger in him, because of his past life, but the whole idea is that relationship with Christine must influence him to become a better person. His devotion to music should make him a better person. He is supposed to be a genious. Unfortunately in this movie the Phantom is potrayed only like a horrible heartless murderer.

too much unnecessary violence in the movie.

I think Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera portrays the Phantom much better, much deeper, not to mention amazing Emmy Rossum's Christine in Weber's Phantom who is much more suitable for Christine's character.

So I give 2 stars, only because of some nice music in the movie.",1106870400,7,1004,4.629213483146067
335964,3,6301603478,"The various movie versions of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" have always been a mix of gothic horror and gothic romance, but it is possible to work one extreme or the other.  The 1990 two-part television version, directed by Tony Richardson with Charles Dance as the Phantom is the most romantic version to date, even more so that the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that was no doubt a source of inspiration.  At the other end of the Phantom spectrum we get this 1989 version, directed by Dwight H. Little with Robert Englund as the title character.  Since we are talking the man who directed ""Halloween 4"" and the actor who played Freddy Kreuger in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, you know that this ""Phantom"" will be closer to a splatter-flick than any other previous retelling of the tale.

During the final credits we are informed that ""This Motion Picture is not associated with any current or prior stage production or motion picture of the same title,"" which is an interesting statement to make but also quite accurate.  That is because this version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" wants to be different, and that is what the screenplay by Gerry O'Hara and Duke Sandefur delivers, even if the logic behind the alterations is suspect.

Our story begins in New York City in the present, where young Christine Day (Jill Schoelen) is preparing for a singing audition.  Her friend, Meg (Molly Shannon), finds part of a score for ""Don Juan Triumphant,"" written by Eric Destler long ago and presumably lost.  Apparently Destler was a prime suspect in the deaths of several people in London a century earlier.  The next thing we know Christine is waking up in London way back when, without any idea that she has become unstuck in time and with a different actress now playing her friend, Meg (Emma Rawson).

Why are we involving time travel in ""The Phantom of the Opera""?  Once you have watched the movie try and figure out the logic of Christine going ""back"" in time for the story to take place since she remembers nothing once she gets there.  The inspiration here seems to be half ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" where the Count and his beloved are tied together throughout eternity, and half ""Faust,"" where a man sells his soul to the Devil to get his heart's desire.  Christine gets to sing in Charles Gounod's opera version of ""Faust"" just in case people are not making the connection (but that assumes you are familiar with the Goethe version of the legend in the first place).  Thus, a supernatural element is added to the story, but not to great effect (especially since it sets up a rather mundane way of Christine trying to break the cycle).  The Phantom is a much scarier person when he is simply a mad genius rather than the Devil's henchman.

You may ask, why is Christine not only Day instead of Daae but also now an American singing at the opera in London instead of Paris (for a movie filmed in Budapest, Hungary)?  I assume it is because most of the cast is English and therefore if it is in London nobody has to pretend to speak with French accents.  Plus, you save big bucks not having to pretend your story is taking place in the magnificent Paris Opera House and not having to drop a chandelier on anybody.

Actually, the major problem with this version is that Christine's voice does not sound that great.  She sounds like a very good high school singer of opera, but hardly a vocal talent that the Phantom would desire to nurture, let along the toast of London.  For that matter, his tutoring is not showing much effect.  He demands she sing with passion and she sounds exactly like she did before.  The critic (Peter Clapham) who panned her singing in ""Faust"" was a bit harsh, but he was going in the right direction.  Maybe we are supposed to be thinking of the Phantom likes children because Englund (a.k.a. Freddy) is playing the character, but having Carlotta (Stephanie Lawrence) be a better singer than Christine is really weird.

But maybe that is the point.  Maybe this Phantom is backing the wrong horse and the only way to get his prodigy on stage is to start killing people.  This would explain why he has to kill a lot of people this time around.  This film is at its best when we get away from the singing and any idea of a romance between Christine and Erik, and the Phantom gets on with the slicing and dicing of the supporting cast.  The twisted difference with this particular Phantom is that his ""mask"" consists of the flesh of his victims sewn over his facial deformities.  Watching Erik sew on the skin will certainly creep you out, although this allows him to walk around and let his face be seen way too much given this is supposed to be a horror movie.  He does don a nice ensemble at one point involving a hat and a scarf across his face, but for some reason things are done at an angle so it looks like he has one eye (to wit, it looks good but makes no sense).

The trailer for this movie explains that some stories are so powerful that they are reborn for each new generation (apparently more than love and music are forever).  This is Hollywood-speak for the idea that Gaston Leroux's novel is so good that they do not think they can really mess it up, no matter what nonsense they come up with for a new version.  The bottom line is that if they jettisoned the whole idea about the eternal lovers unstuck in time and just let this version be about the bloodiest Phantom of them all, then this would have been a much stronger film.  When they get back to the framing device instead of coming up with some really neat way of killing off the Phantom, I was bitterly disappointed because I had sort of forgotten that nonsense was part of this movie.  The decision to make the splatter-flick version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a legitimate one, so there was really no need to throw in all that other junk.",1106438400,8,5849,4.521367521367521

335966,4,6301603478,"I think each version of the Phantom adds something to the genre, but none have equalled the content of the novel.  This version stands up against the recent 2004 film version of the Webber musical (the make-up in the Webber film is awful and looks like a bad skin problem rather than a deformity--the stage version had far better make-up). This 1989 version is better than the 1943 and 1962 versions, although not as good as the 1925 Lon Chaney classic.  Robert Englund does an excellent job of bringing the character to life, the make-up is very good, the soundtrack is excellent, the acting is first-rate.  If you love the novel and are open to varied renditions of the content, this DVD should find a welcome home next to the versions of Lon Chaney, Claude Rains, and Herbert Lom.

My biggest gripe with this one was that, while rich in action and gore, there was too much emphazis placed on the Phantom's murderous impulses than on the overall storyline.

It didn't help either that the producers of this film choose poor Robert Englund to play the Phantom.

It's not that Englund isn't good in the part, it's more that he seems unable to escape the Freddie Kruger persona.

Throughout the entire film I kept thinking I was watching a spin-off of yet another Nightmare on Elms Street.

I did enjoy the operatic scenes of Faust and the way they've incorperated opera culture into the film.

In essence, this is more a mixture of Freddie meets Callas than a true Phantom of the Opera film.

However, the overall result is entertaining enough and with a very nice sound score makes for good watching.

335969,5,6301603478,"First off I rated this movie based on how much I enjoyed it... which is obviously quite a lot. The movie does have some inconsistencies and some acting that could have been better. (mostly in regards to American actors trying to sound British)
But if we're going to review this film fairly, we're going to have to quit comparing Englund's Phantom to Freddy. They have very little in common other than they're both hamburger-faced, viciously kill people and that they're played by the same actor. But what about the Phantom's one-liners in this film? Well, the Phantom is a bitter misanthrope, so that is where his hateful sarcasm comes from. Freddy's humor comes from the fact that he's gleefully toying with his victims. That said, I think this is a very interesting take on the Phantom legend. The story goes something like this; a young singer auditions for an Opera using a piece of music by an unknown composer, who also happened to be a murderer. She's hit in the head when a stagehand drops a sandbag and in a dream state experiences her past life in the 19th century London Opera. (the setting is changed from Paris to London, possibly to give the Phantom more of a ""Jack the Ripper"" edge) The familiar story then begins. Christine is tutored by her ""Angel"", becomes a big star and the Phantom then does anything and kills anyone to ensure her continuing success. The biggest differences in this film (besides its London setting) from the original story are that rather than being a genius born with a horrible deformity, the Phantom is a man who sold his soul to the devil for the immortality of his music. The price happened to be his face. He also gains supernatural powers and immortality for himself, as long as his music remains. (a concept borrowed from The Picture of Dorian Gray and De Palmas Phantom of the Paradise) Also instead of wearing a mask, this Phantom skins his victims, patching up his own face, using crude proto-Plastic Surgery with their scraps. There is no chandelier fall in this film, but it is the first version since 1925 to include the masquerade party, where the Phantom shows up in his Red Death costume. There's plenty of blood and guts in this film as the Phantom slashes his way through his enemies. One great scene has him facing a group of would-be muggers in a dark alley. The imagery is overwhelmingly gothic. Very moody. The phantom's underground sanctum, riddled with candles and a pipe organ is classic. The film did badly, I think mainly because it came in the wake of Webber's extremely popular romantic stage musical. Everyone had their idea of what a Phantom film should be, and this just wasn't it. This Phantom was too evil to pity, and he wasn't very romantic. But when you look at the movie objectively, it's pretty good. Much better than most horror films in the 80's. And next to Freddy, Eric Destler-The Phantom is one of Robert Englunds best performances. He's absolutely wonderful. He makes him a very complex character. On one hand he's a very sensitive, brilliant artist with a kind of nobility to him. On the other hand, he's an almost diabolical character. Evil and power-mad. Englund plays this out very well. As I said there are problems. Some things are never properly explained. How the Phantom retains his reign of terror over the Opera isn't fully explored. How did the Phantom go from being a superstitious ""theater tradition"" to a legend about a man who sold his soul to the devil for music? How did Christine know the words to the Phantom's music? Why didn't she seem surprised at all when her ""Angel"" turned out to be a recluse living underground? Anyway, I'm nit-picking.

1. They kept Leroux's version of the graveyard scene, complete with violin. Even Webber's version wasn't THAT close...

2. The main characters are all basically there. Most other movie versions change names, switch/delete characters, etc.

3. Carlotta dies. 'Nuff said.

4. The opera they based the movie around was Faust, as in the book.

5. Despite the fact that yes, the Phantom is a killer, he still has some very good sensuality about him that is missing from most of the other Phantom films (excepting, of course, the 1925 silent version).

There were some things I hated:

1. Christine travels back in time for no other reason then to give a highly predictable plot twist at the end. Oh, brother.

2. They changed the setting from France to England.

3. He sews SKIN to his FACE??? Gimme a break...

2:The movie does provide a certain atmosphere that other Phantom movies don't provide. I can't quite place it, but there is an aura about the movie that says ""Phantom"".

3: The musical score is fabulous.  No lies.  No Cheezy synthesizer here.

4: It does WAY better as a horror version of Phantom than the crappy one with that Julian guy in it.",1102377600,,447,4.5

This movie starts out in modern (1989) New York. Theater student Christine Day (Jill Schoelen) meets her friend Meg (Molly Shannon) at the library because she's found a 'new' music piece that is sure to win Christine the lead in a musical she's auditioning for. As Christine reads the music, it starts to bleed, an omen of what's to happen. At the audition the next day, just as she finishes the piece, a sand bag falls, nearly hitting her, and crashing into a mirror behind her. Suddenly, she is transported back into 19th century England, where she is an understudy to the London Opera's star Diva, Carlotta, who is jealous of Christine's talent. She also doesn't remember being from the future. Christine remains unphased by Carlotta and the fallen sand bag (which also happened in this time period). She is anxious to meet her music coach, the mysterious ""Angel of Music"" (Robert Englund) that she believes was sent by her father. The ""Angel"" is really Erik Dessler, a disfigured playwrite who sold his soul to the devil, Faust style. He has fallen in love with her, and is very protective of her. He begins to kill anyone who is in the way of Christine's career. First, he kills Joseph, a stage hand who dropped the sand bag that nearly killed Christine. Then there is the opera critic who gives her a bad review because the owner of the Opera has bribed him. His next victim is Carlotta, during the masquerade ball. Finally, Christine and her fiance Raoul get wise to the fact that her ""Angel"" is really a psycho, and take the police to the catacombs under the opera house to search for and arrest The Phantom. This culminates in a scene in which Christine ""kills"" the phantom by trying to destroy his music, and then ""disappears"" herself, only to find herself back in the present, thinkintg the whole thing a nightmare induced by the fallen sand bag. She is given the lead roll by the producer himself, who invites her out to dinner. When they stop at his apartment, the producer goes to ""change"", leaving Christine alone. The producer realizes that his face is falling apart and he needs a new one. Christine sees his studio and goes to see what he is working on. The music that comes from the computer turns out to be a completed version of The Phantom's opera, Don Juan Triumphant! When her reappears, all pretenses are dropped. Erik had returned for Christine, as she had promissed (in her past life) to be his bride. In horror, she rips his face off, and takes all his music. On the street, she rips is all up and throws it into the gutter, where she can hear The Phantom screaming in agony, and we think that he is finally dead.

The most haunting image in this film is probably the final scene, just after Christine has destroyed The Phantom's music. As she's walking down an alley past a violinist, he starts to play ""Don Juan Triumphant"", and we're left to wonder if the Phantom is really dead, and if Christine is to be haunted for all time by him.

This is a fantastic movie. It's one of the few horror films, made after the black-and-white days, that has ever succeeded in actually scaring me. It's a definate must-see for any ""Phantom"" fans. It's also probably the only film to portray The Phantom exclusively as a villan. Robert Englund is amazing as the Phantom, both as a cowering musician and then as a menacing murderer.

I give this movie 5 stars.",1100908800,7,3594,4.541666666666667
336035,1,6301603478,"This film version takes away everything that is wonderful about 'The Phantom of the Opera' and blows it all to hell. Andrew Lloyd Webber's version and the original novel contain so much beauty, so much romanticism, so many haunting images... This terrible Robert Englund film is just a cheap horror film. It's not even scary... it's gross. So it doesn't even work as an effective horror film. It's more a slasher flick. Englund (of Freddy Krueger fame) totally misses the opportunity to play an effective Phantom. He just snarls and grunts and isn't menacing at all. 'The Phantom of the Opera' is one of the most romantic tales of all time. There's no love here. I mean, there are these fights scenes where the Phantom murders people. It's quite pathetic. And then, there are these parallels to modern times??? It's ridicolus. What a miserable film...",1099958400,2,851,4.875862068965517
336036,5,6301603478,"I am so delighted that this is finally being released on DVD.

Of all the phantom films I have seen in my eleven years of being a Phantom phan (not counting the yet to be released 2004 Phantom movie based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical) this is my favorite movie version of all Phantom movies.

Some may balk at the changes to the story from the original novel, and others may be shocked at the gore and violence; and while this movie does reek of many cliches that many 80's horror films tend to (time travel, the occasional bad costume, and emotionless acting by some characters) there are still enough qualities to make this movie worth seeing.

Englund positively shines in his performance. I have heard many people simply pass this off as another ""Freddy-esque"" movie because of the makeup, but the similarities between Englund's most notorious screen character and the Phantom stops there. Englund's Phantom is enigmatic and horrifying, delightfully sarcastic and brooding, sweet at one moment and the murderously violent the next - in this he captures the heart of the original Phantom from Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, despite what others might say. It is also the only film to date (at the time of this review) with the ever famous graveyard scene.

Englund's makeup also deserves props - this is the only version so far that has given any attempt to make the Phantom noseless as he was intended to be in the novel.

Misha Segal's score lends a haunting tone that weaves throughout the film, and mixed with the dramatic settings - the elaborate stage, the Phantom's lair strewn thick with candles - makes this film a definite must-see for anyone who loves Phantom or appreciates dark eye candy.

While some of the film is laughable and unbelievable, the viewer must admit that even the terrifyingly unrealistic parts are, at the very least, creative. Turkish bathhouses and white towels will never look quite the same after seeing this movie.",1097625600,17,1954,4.835329341317365
336037,5,6301603478,This is by far one of Robert Englund's best performances ever> It is a dark and more sinister remake of the Lon chaney classic told in a modern slasher realm. This film delves into the origin of the phantom story why the artistic man behind the music became the terror of london. Many have tried to capture the original and have failed this stands out alone as a horrifying tale of twisted obsession and loss of love. With the slasher effects and death scenes that you've come to know and love from Robert Englund. If you love great horror films and I mean GREAT horror films then this is the perfect addition to any horror collectors library.,1096588800,5,643,4.504273504273504

7812840,2,6301603478,This version is terrible leave it them to have Robert Englund keep his Freddy Krueger persona. I think Andrew Lloyd Webber wouldn't be pleased. No music it's just a movie were the main actress sings for the phantom. The original had music in for a reason to let the audience feel the true passion between the phantom and Christine. This version is typical classic remake of a version of the phantom with a horror film 80s twist to it. When you look at the cover it makes you think of Freddy Kruger. I almost thought it was a Freddy adaption of the phantom lol. I think I will stick to the original. I'm not going to even mention that terrible ending.,1524441600,,650,4.380165289256198

7812846,3,6301603478,"With a story that -- even by then -- had been adapted to death, 1989's take on ""The Phantom of the Opera"" puts a new spin on the mythology by catering to fans of the great stab n' slash films of the era. To help seal the deal, genre icon Robert Englund -- having starred as Freddy Krueger in five ""Elm Street"" films by that point -- is cast in the titular role. Some creative license is taken with the source material, tinkering with the Phantom's origin and setting a slice of the action in the present, but for the most part, this is familiar terrain with a twist.

 Jill Schoelen plays Christine, a burgeoning opera singer who is slightly out of tune in her time. When a stage accident sends her back in time -- to 1881 London, specifically -- she must reconcile the artist she admires most with the monster he has become. Enter Robert Englund as the Phantom. With a face that not even a mother could love, a deal with the devil gone south has forced him into the shadows. Below the opera house, he grows bitter without the fanfare afforded by his work and starts picking off cast and crew in routine fashion in an effort not only please Christine, but apparently himself as well.

Director Dwight H. Little (""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"") gives probably his most show-y film to date. Like his previous outing with Michael Myers, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" attempts to build atmosphere and suspense, but is often undercut by its cookie-cutter body-count formula. Once the killing gets going, the film actually gets dull, as one gets the feeling we've seen this before. On the upside, Englund, clearly relishing the opportunity to stretch his legs here, gives a great performance that in a better context, would be downright iconic. His make-up job is a little too close to Freddy at times, but most traces of that character are gone from his performance. The film doesn't always quite work, but when it does, it's because of Englund. Worth watching to see a different spin on well-worn material and to see the lovely Jill Schoelen, whose filmography is sadly too brief. Likewise, look out for a pre-Saturday Night Live Molly Shannon as Christine's modern-day best friend. I wouldn't go singing its praises from the rafters, but I wouldn't bury it below the surface either.",1510531200,,2288,4.658415841584159
