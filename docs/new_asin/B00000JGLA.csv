It is so ludicrous and utterly preposterous that it is entertaining in its own badness. Where else can you see Pat Morita portray an illustrious herpetologist who hunts 30 foot poisonous snakes with nothing more than a stick? Let me just say this...wait for the drop-kick.

King Cobra was better acted and had better special effects than ""Sssssss"" and the writer was obviously influenced somewhat by that earlier film.  In this movie, a genetically altered Cobra/Rattlesnake hybrid escapes from a lab because of the head-researchers' ""poor people skills"" and goes on a killing spree two years later.  It's up to Arnold from ""Happy Days"" to  save the day by attempting to kick some serious snake butt, without using any karate moves at all.  The scene where the overzealous hunters got their ... kicked by the snake was a hoot.  And you can't miss Eric Estradas' cameo role as a... beer distributor.  He was very good... maybe a little TOO good.  The use of sudden bass drum effects were very well timed and had me literally jumping out of my seat, on more than one occasion!

1232189,1,B00000JGLA,"King Cobra is a superb example of the cheap and nameless talent that is currently riddling Hollywood. Nay, it is a prime example of the notoriously distinguished group of morons that actually feed money into the creaking gears in the minds(if you'd go as far as calling them that) of random flunkies from film school that think that just because you can point a camera and shoot that you are an artist. Occasionally, I will sit back,relax, and view a good ol' fashioned straight to video film. Most of those times I am not sorely disappointed....boy was King Cobra an exception. This thing was so dull and stupid that I didn't even feel like making fun of it. When i saw this i was amidst friends, and as is common with friends and a turd of a movie we wanted to make fun of it whilst getting totally blottoed. Unfortunately, this thing is so horrendous that we didn't even have the usually overbearing desire to mock it. We also discovered that a pretty heavy buzz can be gone in a matter of seconds when you have an equal amount of terrible film jabbing into your eyes, as this ""film"" does. That's right, this movie isn't even good for people who love bad movies.  I don't know who compared this to Anaconda, but to say that is giving the filmakers behind this atrocity of film way too much credit....WAY TOO MUCH! And everyone knows Anaconda wasn't exactly great. The fake looking Cobra (who sleeps on the ground, climbs trees, blinks, raises its eyebrows in recognition, and never flexes its neck, which remains in an L-shaped position at all times), the uber-lackluster acting, the horrible script and story, the worthless cinematography, and the stupid editing make this film a waste of time even for the most educated ""bad film connoisseurs"".  Don't waste your time and money on this, don't listen to those reviewers that said it was greatbecause they are obviously part of the filmaking team or are hellbent on self torture.",966902400,,1932,4.679411764705883

1232192,5,B00000JGLA,"I went into ""King Cobra"" wanting to hate it. And I do mean hate; the sort of all consuming, all caps HATE I reserve for my list of worst films. Why should I bear such animosity for a film I haven't even watched yet? Moreover, why bother watching a movie that I will probably loathe? The answer to the former is this: ""King Cobra"" is yet another tired entry in the tired ""animals run amok"" genre revived by Spielberg's 1975 magnum opus ""Jaws"" and later rescuitated by the same director's CGI masterpiece ""Jurassic Park."" If you've seen one ""Jaws"" knockoff you've probably seen them all, and ""King Cobra"" makes it very apparent almost from the beginning that its paying ""homage"" to Spielberg's monster movies. The answer to the second question is more elusive, mired somewhere deep in my brain. I don't know why I like watching bad cinema. I can say that it's great fun to watch a movie fail, as much fun as watching a good one succeed. Too, I get an enormous charge out of reviewing horrible movies. It's amusing to bash a piece of celluloid trash that deserves whatever nasty things I can say about it.

All of which brings us to ""King Cobra,"" a film directed by Scott and David Hillenbrand, special effects provided by the Chiodo Brothers (who brought us ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space""), and starring has beens Hoyt Axton, Courtney Gains, and Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita. Yep, Pat Morita tops the bill in this ""so bad it's good"" car wreck. Before all you Mr. Miyagi fans get your knickers in a bunch, however, let me inform you that ""King Cobra"" is not a cinematic tour de force. Rather, it's an atrocious rip-off so loaded down with plot holes that it makes Uwe Boll's work look like ""Citizen Kane."" When Dr. Irwin Burns's (Joseph Ruskin) laboratory goes up in flames thanks to a reckless assistant (Courtney Gains), a king cobra/diamondback rattlesnake hybrid some thirty feet long named Seth is born. Flash forward two years (?) to a little California town holding a beer festival. Local cop Jo Biddle (Casey Fallo), her disenchanted boyfriend Dr. Brad Kagan (Scott Hillenbrand), Sheriff Ben Lowry (Eric Lawson), and hotshot herpetologist Nick Hashimoto (Morita) must band together to stop the hungry Seth from wreaking havoc in the woods outside of town. Sounds great, doesn't it?

It's not, not by a long shot, but ""King Cobra"" is one of the funniest films I've seen in ages. That it's not marketed as a comedy makes little difference; the stuff we see here is gut busting, throw back your head and howl hilarious. Let's get the laughs rolling by looking at the relationship between Biddle and Brad Kagan. The doctor plans on leaving town for the big city in search of excitement, but Biddle likes her life and refuses to join him. In a scene obviously meant to be serious but as far from it as possible, Kagan and Biddle debate his reasons for leaving. At one point in the pointless narrative, actor Hillenbrand stares at Biddle with such a stupid look on his face that I couldn't help but giggle. O.K., hardly the belly laugh I promised, but the film is just getting started. As an aside, I find it ironic that the only intentional laugh getter in the movie, a group of local yokel hunters who eventually fall prey to the snake, isn't funny in any way, shape, or form. The rest of the cast provides more laughs than a Rodney Dangerfield concert, but these guys induce barely a snicker. Anyway, the serious yucks fade in when we see Erik Estrada waltzing down the street camping it up as a flamboyant gay man. As embarrassing as the scene is to watch, I'm adding a star to the overall review for the sheer audacity it took to put such an idiotic sequence in the movie.

I could write a doctoral dissertation on Pat Morita's role in this movie--or an obituary for his acting career. He shows up to help when contacted by Dr. Burns, roaring into town in a mobile home with a bunch of gimcracks to catch the snake. He tells us to ""respect"" the snake, and later on launches into one of the biggest piles of bunkum ever heard in a b-movie, namely that he injects himself with venom every couple of months to keep his immunity levels up. His blood, we learn, is worth ""a couple of million dollars"" as anti-venom. Uh huh. I ultimately bought the explanation because the august Morita delivered the lines like he believed them. Well, that and I was too busy trying to retrieve the lung I coughed up while laughing to really question what he said. But what really takes the cake is Morita's standoff with Seth. Folks, if I live to be a hundred years old I will never witness anything as funny as this sequence. Not only does Morita stare down the cheesy looking snake, he soon suffers bite after bite. His character absorbs enough venom to kill the population of China and he's still on his feet. Morita's death scene--complete with facial expressions that looked like the actor bit into a lemon, a camera spinning around the actor in an effort to simulate his death throes, and sad music--reduced me to a series of honking sounds I didn't think human vocal cords could produce.

Wooden acting, cliches piled atop cliches, and ridiculous dialogue mark every aspect of ""King Cobra,"" but the whole is so funny you won't mind. O.K., you probably will mind if you take it seriously for a second. Those looking for a so bad it's good flick, though, will find much to adore here. Trimark releases ""King Cobra"" to DVD with an awesome widescreen transfer, a commentary, a making of feature, and a bunch of trailers. If you like laughing until it hurts, definitely check this one out.",1111276800,4,5569,4.6165489404641775
1232193,3,B00000JGLA,"This is just an average snake movie starring Pat Morita from the Karate Kid movies & Scott Brandon.  Scott is a local doctor at a small town in California, Kasey Fallo is his girlfriend & a local cop.  Pat Morita comes in around halfway through the flick as a snake expert.

It opens when 2 disgruntled scientists pissed at the pace of the research decide to lock the head in his office & speed up the pace of the work, in the process they get carried away & cause a huge explosion & fire where Seth, the snake escapes & kills the head guy's daughter from a bite, but the head guy lives to escape.  The other 2 were killed by the explosion & fire.

Later on, the snake makes its presence known in town by going a spree of killing people, by the 2nd attack Scott, Kasey, & the mayor get worried about what they're dealing with, esp. when a deputy finds a huge snakeskin intact.  They realize its a 30-footer & decide to get antivenom & summon the help of the expert.  The 2nd half is mainly just battle planning, dialog about the severity of the situation, & the showdown between Pat & Seth.  A cheesy scene is when some local hunters decide to pursue Seth with Rambo-esque tactics & state of the art weaponry, but they're killed off one by one.

The camerawork is good, it is very well done & keeps you on the edge of your set.  The acting is good, but uneven at times, esp. a cameo by Erik Estrada as a gay brewmaster which was really pointless, I felt.  The story & plot are good, but the pacing is very uneven, a lot of moments of on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense & some scary scenes, but also a lot of meaningless dialog & romancing by Scott & Kasey.

Not a bad snake at all, it's better than it's given credit for, but far from the greatest around.",1095984000,2,1754,4.265861027190332

Pat Morita ""stars"" as a herpetologist who is recruited to destroy this giant snake named Seth, which escaped from its laboratory when a shot up techy decided to try something new and blew the lab up.  Character actor Joseph Ruskin plays the scientist who managed the project, and lost an eye in the fire.  The snake is on the loose during a beer making festival (that's original), and it chomps on a few locals before being unceremoniously killed in the end.  Director Hellenbrand stages some nice scary moments early in the film, but he never shows us the full snake (budget probably didn't allow), but the close-ups are pretty effective.

1232197,4,B00000JGLA,"Giant snake movies have been popular enough for quite a few of them to be made.  This one involves a giant snake that is half king cobra and half diamondback rattler.  That alone would make for a nasty critter, but there is no explanation as to why the thing is so big.
There is also a gap after the snake escapes (before the credits) and the main bulk of the movie.  We get a screen with the words ""2 Years Later"".  What has the giant snake been doing in all that time?
There was a touch of Jaws added in that the snake comes to a small town that is just about to be in the middle of a festival that spells financial freedom for much of the town (a local brewery is going to go national).
Our cast of characters includes the Mayor (Hoyt Axton is great as usual), his daughter who is a police officer, and her boyfriend who is the town doctor but is moving to the big city.  Add the scientist whose lab the snake escape from (actually a good guy) and a herpetologist (Pat Morita) and you have pretty much the whole thing.
While this snake is huge, it is not bulletproof like Python.  It is  a normal genetically-spliced specimen.  Ordinary tactics will work against it.
The film does a pretty good job of adding some tension and scenes that make you jump or flinch (something lacking from most of the snake movies).  All in all a pretty good effort.",1062115200,13,1349,4.258823529411765
1232198,1,B00000JGLA,"King Cobra
I didn't know this was a sequel to the 1997 sleeper ""Anaconda"" until I looked it up on IMDb. Needless to say, it's worse than the original.
""The Karate Kid"" star Pat Morita (yeah, the Chinese guy) stars as a snake hunter who must track down a genetically-altered King Cobra python-whatever when it escapes its super-duper high tech prison: a tin cage. Wow, the government must really be cutting down on containment these days. Anyway, Pat goes after the snake with the help of Scott Hillenbrand (also co-director of this journey) and Casey Fallo, who do, of course, fall in love and kiss right after a snake is about to chomp their heads off. But that's okay - it's in the script.
There are countless things in this film that are truly laughable, including the scene where Pat Morita tells Hillenbrand that he injects himself with snake venom to acquire an immunity to it. You can see the regret in Pats eyes. He knows this is a stinky movie, and he hates having to say what hes saying. Hes been around in the Hollywood circuit long enough to know that saying that kind of thing can get a film - and an actor - killed. But directors can be very picky about their films. I just thought of something that rhymes with picky, as well.
Pat Morita is in the low-point of his career. Actually, let's face it: He doesn't have a career. He got lucky off a few Karate Kid movies, and his fame disappeared instantaneously. He tried to get back in the acting showbiz with The Next Karate Kid, but his plan backfired, and his apprentice in the film became the one to gain worldwide recognition AND an Oscar (Hilary Swank). Too bad for Pat.
Scott Hillenbrand is like scraping the bottom of the barrel. His acting talent is niltch. He cant direct or act, which leaves me to wonder...how did he get his big break? I cant imagine he gained anything from the 1997 thriller Hostile Takeover.
David Hillenbrand, Scotts brother, is the other co-director of this film. And quite frankly, they both share the family gene specialty, which is being manager at a McDonalds somewhere out in Oklahoma. Thats their specialty, and they should stick to it.
Saying this movie is bad is like saying ""Anaconda"" was sort of bad. The original was awful enough, but this sinks even lower in the depths than the original.
Sure, it's great for a Friday or Saturday night when you've got nothing else to do. But in all honestly, I'd rather waste 93 minutes of my life on something good than something below-average, even if it has a campy quality to it (and not much at that!).
Worth avoiding at all costs. Well, almost all costs. Its hard to keep a straight face when Morita says he injects himself with snake poison. What a pathetic way to make the hero immune to venom. B-A-D is written all over this straight-to-video flop.",1049068800,4,2798,4.553571428571429

7912085,5,B00000JGLA,"This movie is a gripping, compelling account of the dangers of alcoholism and drug abuse. The movie starts us off in a lab, where the titular giant snake is exposed to chemicals that make him hyper aggressive (clearly a metaphor for the dangers of methamphetamine). The snake then goes on a rampage, killing most of his caretakers. Struck by grief, he flees into the woods, where he lays low for several years, trying to recover from his condition. However, when a nearby town hosts a beer festival, the snake succumbs to his addiction, attacking a pair of teenagers and a man in a cabin, all of whom had just been drinking beer themselves. When several people from the town, including a noted snake tamer, stage an intervention, the drunken snake attacks the snake tamer. The camera slowly spins around the snake and the dying snake tamer, illustrating the grief the snake feels over killing another creature. Consumed with sadness, the snake allows himself to be placed in a cage to keep himself from attacking anyone else. It is a beautiful tragedy that goes far beyond the surface issue of a giant monster to explore the root causes of what makes a monster. The movie does end on a hopeful note, however, when we see the snake emerge out of the cage, presumably reformed and ready to live a better life.",1363305600,,1307,4.6869565217391305
7912086,3,B00000JGLA,"Ahhhh Mr Collins. King Cobra is yet another film paying homage to the golden years where Sid was living the carefree good life. As you know the 90's films have struck a chord with the brothers Sid on many levels. Sure most of them suck by conventional means, but maybe that's why Kieth cannot be killed by conventional weapons. We don't care how the masses may hate these films. The brothers Sid can't get enough of their low budget, poorly acted sweet sweet candy. Along with cyborgs the mid-late 90's was dominated with reptile creature features. Every month there was some new type of B creature flick popping up in the ""Guaranteed to be there or it's free"" slot, and we were always first in line to get our hands on them. It really started with Python that was bought for $10 at the time. Back then $10 was a steal for a DVD. Now you can get these type movies for less then a few bucks, or fight with all the chicos plowing through the $5 bin. After python came crocodile and so on and so on.

So in the final creature flick of the decade, King Cobra starts off in the typical genre fashion. A bunch of science nerds are messing around with some serum intended to have a good purpose. This experimental serum is naturally released causing a frightening genetic mutation of a King Cobra/Diamondback snake. Despite the fact that the snake was made of plastic, it's a pretty scary thought. This sucker is huge! We're looking at a 30 foot snake on the loose ready to eat up all the towns people. He'll even snake the kitchen sink like Moby. As the snake starts ripping people apart, the town sheriff and a science chick are doing everything they can to stop the beast. Since they can't seem to do anything they can only turn to one man....Mr Miyagi. All 4 feet of him. Even that doesn't work because the cobra whoops that little Asian a** with 4 consecutive bites to the face. Eventually they trap the snake in some huge tube and salvage whats left of their hick town.

King Cobra wasn't without it's moments, but really didn't live up to the remembered expectations. Why did we think it was so cool back then? Honestly it earned at least a star and a half simply off sentimental value alone. Also a quick cameo by Erik Estrada playing a gay dude didn't hurt. It was actually the only role he's ever seemed really convincing in...hmmmm can we say JARED? Wow can't believe that kid made it into a review. So in a way we actually reviewed Jared, yeah awesome. Anyway, we will give props to the snake who apparently was named Seth. SOmehow they managed to name the snake in between the horrid acting. What's nice is Seth was actually made out of material instead of some poorly made 3rd grade graphics crap. It's nice to see a creature actually constructed and held up by a bunch of stagehands. Now that's a creature feature. Could've been much better but still provided enough laughs to make it watchable. Not every year like Death Ring though....it will never be like that.",1307577600,,2972,4.481549815498155
7912087,3,B00000JGLA,"In ""King Cobra"" Scott and David Hillenbrand bring us another giant snake epic. I have seen any number of this genre of films and this is actually one of the more entertaining of the bunch. The film borrows conceptually from the great ""animals gone wild"" films that came before it, most notably ""Jaws"", but does so in an entertaining manner that lets the film be derivative yet simultaneously amusing.

The film opens in a secret lab where there is a mutiny by several underlings who don't understand the scientific method at all well. The net result is the release of Seth, a giant half-cobra, half-rattlesnake mutant which was bio-engineered for maximum aggression.

Two years later a small town is preparing to host a lager festival, which is wholeheartedly endorsed by Erik Estrada in a hilarious and very flamboyant cameo completely unlike his typecast roles. After a few deaths the mayor is asked to call off the festival, but of course that's out of the question. An expert herpetologist is called. Who could it be? None other than Pat Morita, who comes up with a plan involving a vibrating machine, a large metal tube, and a goat to capture the snake. To say that the plan encounters difficulties is something of an understatement. (As an aside, is kung fu really a recommended method of self defense against a thirty foot long snake?) The plot is resolved and the cast is thinned out in a manner you may be completely expecting, but the scenes of the love-struck protagonists rolling a giant tube containing a huge snake around in the forest is a special treat.

The DVD has several extras including a decent commentary from the Hillenbrand brothers, a trailer for the film, and a making of feature that is brief but interesting. For all the cheesiness to be had here the actual models and special effects are notably better than many CGI snakes that have starred in other (even worse) giant snake films.

If you like implausible B-movies featuring giant creatures eating helpless small town citizens, this is a predictable, inane, yet fairly entertaining herpetological voyage.",1210896000,4,2086,4.8841807909604515
