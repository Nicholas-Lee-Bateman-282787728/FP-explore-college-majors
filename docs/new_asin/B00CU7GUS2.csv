8586427,1,B00CU7GUS2,"I was expecting a professionally done product at the price point. In my opinion, the product is not worth more than $5. It arrived on an over the counter bought DVD-RW disc. The label is hand written and I honestly thought I had just bought a 'boot-leg' copy of the disc. As for the content, not what I was expecting. If a sample portion of the disc was available, it would have given me the chance to not order based on what I saw. The same voice is used for all three pumpkins with not much character. It is not near to par with similar products at the same cost. It might be used to entertain the little kids in a Halloween party, but I don't think it is worth using in any yard displays.",1384300800,11,691,4.125925925925926
