8700984,5,B00T94QXU4,"This set is everything I love about the neo-pop aesthetic that clothing brands like UNIF seek to create. VHS scratches, grocery store muzak, Christian youth indoctrination videos, pubic hair dye instructionals, neon-lights, primary color triangles, roller blades, y2k -
Everything about this set is perfect for the ""a e s t h e t i c"" niche. I was a bit hesitant because I thought, per another user's review, that each disc would be only a bit over an hour each. However, friends and I found out that the first disc alone contains over 4 hours of footage. We were not disappointed. For people who have seen Adult Swim's ""Off the Air,"" this is a better, retro-version of it. $35 is a perfectly reasonable price.",1488153600,,710,4.688

8700986,3,B00T94QXU4,"I thought it was going to be a mixtape, like TV Carnage or maybe in the vein of Found Footage Festival without the commentary.  This is just a collection of trailers for terrible movies and TV shows that you've most likely never heard of.  Rather than short bursts of mind-bending madness, like what you'd see on a mixtape - each clip here is more than 2-3 minutes in length.  I suppose it's OK as long as you know what you're getting into but I was expecting something different of this 3 DVD set and I couldn't find a description for what it was anywhere.  Comes with no extras - just 3 DVD discs, and each runs a little over an hour.",1466812800,,636,4.231404958677686
