6282400,5,B00INCEO3Q,"was an entertaining good low budget film, could use more movies like this, no need for crazy special effects etc",1399593600,2,112,4.65
6282401,4,B00INCEO3Q,Good stoner flick.  If you are at all interested in these types of 'drug smuggling-dealing' movies.. this one is good enough to watch.  4 joints up!,1399248000,,148,4.653846153846154
6282402,4,B00INCEO3Q,"I am really into these types of movies ( Based on a true story Gangster/Drug Dealer Movies), if you are I think your going to enjoy watching this one,

Don't Watch this expecting to see something Like johnny depp Blow or Denzel Washington's American Gangster

The actors are unknowns and i think that is a very good thing, what you have is a bunch of school kids who start selling drugs to get rich quick, overall this is a good movie well worth watching :-)",1399075200,,458,4.376470588235295

6282404,4,B00INCEO3Q,"A fun drug-fueled romp that benefits from its two charismatic leads, much in the same vein as 'Spring Breakers', but don't expect any kind of masterpiece. The main villain is goofy and annoying, and often takes you out of the interesting story at hand, but the film still stays relatively balanced until the end. Not perfect, but fun.",1398038400,3,334,4.775862068965517

6282511,3,B00INCEO3Q,"This was an okay movie, and I'm sort of glad that I watched it, but I probably will not watch it again.

This is a movie about teenage stupidity and self-centeredness. It is a true story. An Idaho teen actually did create a multi-million dollar business going to Canada and bringing back marijuana. He was the mastermind controlling a group of teens who worked for him. We see Canadian and American customs agents grow more and more suspicious of his multiple trips to visit a Canadian friend, becoming properly suspicious when he drives north with a passenger, but returns home alone while his passenger or passengers hike souith through the woods.

The ending is what most conservative viewers would expect, but many liberals were probably rooting for the Kid and his cohorts instead.

If you'd like to understand smuggling that did actually happen, then by all means watch this movie. Once will probably be as many times as you'll watch the movie, but you will learn from it, I'm sure.",1444867200,,988,4.8

It's just so hard to find movies today where care is taken to create characters who are real, with good dialog and lots of tension but  Kid Cannabis pulls it off.

6282550,4,B00INCEO3Q,"Great movie about a high school dropout making a pot operation in rural Idaho by smuggling pot from Canada.

The acting is good but I like the true story better. It is so interesting that such drug smuggling had occurred and is still occurring.

Also, it is interesting to note, how everything unfolds. In essence, lack of discipline and greed always brings the downfall of any organization.

In terms of the drug policy, well, my training in economics says that we should legalize drugs but I think we may be oversimplifying the problem.

Yes, there will be always demand for drugs and legalizing it seems obvious but I think we should think deeper and ask the questions why are people  doing drugs. Is it pain? just recreation? Also, why are some people just consuming responsibly while others are completely addicted?

I think we should as society focus on understanding drugs and drug consumption instead of either simply saying let's all ban it or legalize everything.

I apologize for the detour, anyway, very enjoyable movie.",1434067200,,1032,4.896551724137931

6282557,5,B00INCEO3Q,"This isn't a hundred million dollar AAA movie but it's a great watch. I decided to give it a 5 star rating based on 3 things.

1. It was a fun and interesting movie.
2. The main character ""Nate Normand"" seems like an average or just below average kid doing what he thinks is right which seems a lot like what I would have done in his situation other than some differences towards the end.
3. The movie kept my attention throughout every scene and didn't have any part where I was bored, wanted to pause the movie and play with my phone.

It gives you a little fuel rush of wanting to get rich quick and had me and my friends talking about a bunch of different legal business ventures after having viewed it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it even if they aren't a fan of weed.",1429488000,2,800,4.188311688311688

6282584,3,B00INCEO3Q,"Nate Norman (Jonathan Daniel Brown) is a drop out pizza delivery boy in northern Idaho. He helps out his single mom who struggles as a waitress. As an avid reader of High Times, he knows he can score great pot in Canada and utilize the easy walk across the border to transport it into Idaho.  He manages to get a financial backer (Ron Perlman) and assembles a team of his high school buds...pun intended.

Unfortunately Nate is an amateur at the game. He steps on the toes of his competitor, flaunts his wealth, and has an inner circle with no loyalty.

The film is based on a true story, one without a financial backer. Norman claims he simply expanded the business with the profits from the previous crossing. The movie has the look and feel of a teen sex romp with all the women in northern Idaho being tens.

Other than being based on a true story, there is really nothing to separate it from the pack.

Okay s a rental.

8643607,5,B00INCEO3Q,I was surprised that the movie took place in Idaho because usually nothing exciting happens in this state. The movie was a bit long with not much action but it was worth watching especially if you're into modern movies about marijuana. The movie was released a couple of years after states started to legalize marijuana yet it's still illegal in Idaho because they're always several steps behind. The attitude of the movie was spot on for Idaho. It's a very isolated place with a lot of terrible jobs and poor educational systems and I can see why someone who grew up in Idaho would take a shot at smuggling marijuana. A lot of Idahoans smoke yet the state still pretends that it's bad.,1489190400,,686,4.585365853658536
