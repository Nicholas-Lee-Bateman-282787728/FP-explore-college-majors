8091479,5,B00004VYIE,"Although it will finally tear at your heart, this is a beaautiful story of a passionate chef taken into a culturally barren world via the death of czarism in Russia, particularly Georgian Russia.  Artfully pits the revolution against what once was. Spectacular costumes, scenery and food styling!",1265760000,,296,5.297872340425532
8091480,1,B00004VYIE,"It's easy to see why this film didn't get anywhere, as it represents the other side of French film -- wooden, stereotypical characters and actors so cynical that they can't pull it off. The absence of chemistry between the lovers in this film made it interminable to sit through. It was difficult to observe Pierre Richard's loving smiles at her when his eyes and body language were like steel only when with her, but free everywhere else. The interrupting narrative was probably a bad idea, as it interjected just when things seemed to be getting moving. Not to mention that the scenes with the revolutionaries, although the lines seemed believable, were filmed in such a stilted way that no one could come across without being a laughable Russian caricature. In that regard, it was highly disrespectful to the plight of the deeply oppressed, largely uneducated Russian people (at the time of the revolution). And that's the crux of the problem -- the chef is supposedly in love with Georgia and its native dishes. Yet, the director's obvious contempt for these people and their mistrust of sophistication works against the storyline.",1112572800,3,1135,4.978947368421053
