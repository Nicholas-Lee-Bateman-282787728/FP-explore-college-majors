1083584,4,6305859612,"I found this video to be a good workout, my legs were sore the next day which meant I was working the right muscles. I do think she is a little corny in how she talks and makes little jokes and raves about the music. The music is not really that important or great, I mostly just follow her moves. I would suggest if you want to get your heart rate going and sweat a little then this is definitely a good workout video.  I don't feel like it was a waste of money at all. good luck!",989193600,13,481,3.9081632653061225
1083585,4,6305859612,"I own about a dozen exercise videos, and boy is it refreshing to see a video where the instructor looks real.  Sometimes I stare at my TV in disbelief at the perfect bodies of the people in these videos, and how they do endless repetitions like robots with perfect form.  I find it actually DEmotivating at times.  Leslie Sansone provides a nice reality check as she stresses the benefits of exercise rather than how far short of some ideal body we might be.  She is warm and convincing and she cues well.  Her style of simple yet effective moves suits me fine.  You can vary the intensity of this workout with the addition of hand weights.  She uses weighted gloves, which isn't indicated on the box, a minor complaint.  Give it a try if you're in the mood for a lower-key style.",984614400,90,780,4.443661971830986
1083586,5,6305859612,"This appears to be one of Leslie's latest videos, with a release date on the sleeve of the video as 1998, but apparently released to the public in 2000.  Leslie made several changes from her previous videos that a lot of people will like, and some won't.  She sticks to her 2 mile walk strategy and adds interval cross training to the mix to increase fat burning and increase toning muscles. She will have 2-3 minutes of aerobic high cardio workout and then 2-3 minutes of toning (multiple repetions) with aid of hand weights.  This makes the workout less cario focused and more focued on toning.  I found this workout very intense and made me break out in a sweat very quickly.  There are some steps, like lunges and knee bends that those with delicate knees will want to work carefully with this video.
For those who have her ""In Home Walking"" video, it is similar in that it uses handweights and she is alone in the studio, not surrounded by others.  However, this video is twice as long and feels much more intense.
For those who like the high cardio emphasis of Leslie's videos, you may not like this one too much.  However, I highly recommend it for those who would like to try something a little different made by a really good instructor.",981331200,49,1246,4.511111111111111
1083587,5,6305859612,"Great video, lets you set your own pace and very easy to follow. I think anybody who wants a video they can truely follow should buy this video!  Perfect for all levels of fitness. A great buy!",963360000,7,193,4.216216216216216
1083661,5,6305859612,"I have used this DVD from July 1st, 2007 to September 1st, 2007 and lost 19 kg (41.8 lbs). I started out at a body weight of 130 kg (286 pounds) and got to 111 kg (244.2 lbs) during this time.
 I recommend this DVD to oversized/overweight people that need a good starting DVD for their weight loss programs (which was my case too).It is a program that does not require you to move your body in strange positions that can get you injured and in the same time uses a minimal set of equipments (2 weights) and a small space within your apartment. (No chairs, balls or other complicated devices are required)
 I also recommend medical supervision during your weight loss as I have first gone to an endocrinologist with my medical (blood) records. Based on my blood test results she recommended me the proper medication and diet. For all of you people that need to loose weight diet does not equal hunger. This is something my doctor told me and read in many weight loss books. Consuming just the right (minimal) amounts and types of food necessary to your body is very important in the process. For many of us the change in our daily diets needs to be permanent. Once again stay away of hunger strikes and heavy exercises in the beginning as they will weaken you and you will lose your enthusiasm for the program very quickly.
 I have done the program daily (it is a 30 minutes long) for two months. I have also used heavier weights (5 pounds) as I had some sports background and found those weights to fit me best. I would not recommend heavy weights for this DVD as it will not help you. By the way I am a male in my late 30's in case anyone wants to compare with themselves.
 After 2 months I got with my weight were I told you in my first lines and also stabilized some of the blood indices I needed to.
 After these 2 months I started on different programs that combine strength training with cardio and abs. My next purchase will be Cindy Crawford's ""The Next Challenge DVD"" from which I had the chance to do a few exercises lately and I am also looking for similar types of DVD's to purchase in the near future.
 Another important thing for all you guys that want to loose weight is that you do not have to follow 1:1 everything that is on these DVD's. In the case of this DVD there is nothing you should be aware off. Listen to what Leslie says in the DVD and cut corners in the beginning if you need to. Stop if necessary then continue. Little by little you will get up to speed and feel once again like a million dollar! ;)
 Lately a lot of people I know ask me about the miracle pills I have taken. For all you out there there is no miracle pill out there (yet)but with determination you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.
 Good luck!",1189468800,2,2752,4.289017341040463
1083662,5,6305859612,I have several of Leslie's tapes and try to change every few days to keep it interesting.  This one is challenging for me but not impossible.  I love working out at home.  At first I found Leslie a bit chatty but she grew on me and now I enjoy her tapes.  Other members of my family use her tapes also and everyone of us feels we get a good workout with them.  I will keep using all her tapes.  Guess you can say I'm a fan!,1185667200,,423,3.86046511627907
1083663,3,6305859612,I have several of Leslie's DVDs and this one would be great for beginners. I like to keep my heart rate up and this one didn't do it. She gets you going at good pace then stops for toning. She should haved used some weights to keep the heart rate up on this one! The music doesnt flow with the work out. While cooling down the music was still high energy...that was weird.,1181174400,3,372,4.109589041095891
1083664,5,6305859612,"I have excercised excessively in the past, then slid away for months or years. My problem has been consistency - as Kathy Smith says, to get fit you need to do something daily, without fail. With this amazing video I finally feel I can stick to it because I actually enjoy it. There is no dread when thinking, ok, it's time to work out.

Good points:

1. Including warm up and cool down it's only half an hour, but is equivalent to a two mile walk.

2. Intervals are mostly squats and lunges. The video is easy and pleasant but gives you enough burn on thighs to feel you are shaping your body. Even my arms are shaping up with light toning repeated consistently.

3. Mal-coordinated? This is the video for you. The moves are so, so simple. You won't lose performance flailing around with some step.

4. Zero impact, but watch the knees with the lunges, correct form means you'll be OK.

5. The mild, easy nature of the workout may put off the superfit heroes. But if you do it every day you yourself will wind up very strong and fit with toned thighs. Very little pain, lots of gain! Its very mildness is a plus for me, because, as I've said, it means I stay motivated to work out 7 days a week not kill myself on three days a week and make excuses the rest of the time.

I'm in early pregnancy (my third) and suddenly believe I can be strong, fit and healthy the whole way through. Towards the later months I may switch to Smith's pregnancy workout, but for now this is the tape of choice. If you use one tape daily yes, you will be bored, but a little boredom is a an ok price to pay if I workout and tone every day. 14 miles a week will keep me healthy at minimal time cost to myself. I can even fit it in with two infant children!

Leslie, as an author I know we all read our Amazon reviews so let me say - excellent job!",1167696000,7,1826,4.138418079096045
1083665,4,6305859612,I have a few of Leslie's DVDs.  My favorite is the two mile walk with the hand weights.  This one I just bought and have only done 3 times so far.  I like it a lot.  I feel the muscles have been worked.  I think its great for the lower body especially!  I am going to do this fat burner one 3 times a week and Leslie's two mile walk away the pounds 3 times a week.  I recommend both DVDs!,1145577600,4,388,3.7160493827160495

1083667,5,6305859612,"This is my personal favorite of Leslie's videos.  I lost 70 pounds just doing regular workouts, but got bored with doing the same thing everyday.  I just started doing Leslie's videos and just love them!  I do this one the most and it is easy to fit it in when rushed for time.  I especially like the lower body workout with the lunges and squats.  I can feel my lower half getting smaller doing these.  The lunges with the french presses are really killers.  But when I am done with this video I feel I burned some calories.  The walking part isn't very strenuous, but it sure feels good to go back to the walking after the lunges and squats.

I think I must have all of her videos now and love to be able to pick a 1 mile, 2 mile or 3 or 4 mile workout.  Whatever the time you have to exercise, there is a video to fit that slot.  Keep up the good work, Leslie! We want more, more, more!!!!",1107907200,16,892,4.068965517241379
1083668,5,6305859612,"I just received my Fat burner Walk 2 Miles Leslie Sansone DVD.  I personally think this is a great work out.  Years ago I had her one mile walk aerobics vhs tape...no longer have a vcr so I decided to buy a few of her DVDs.

I just did the routine...about 30 minutes. I wasn't out of breath but I am sweating! Make sure you have one or two pound hand weights...fortunately I had some but didn't realize it when I ordered.

I just started trying to get back in shape...I'm 42 and I followed every step and kept up! I work too many hours to go out walking so I'm hoping this will be a wonderful alternative.  This video works your legs and arms and lots of other parts. We'll see how sore I am tomorrow...lol.

Anyway...I'll give it 5 Stars!  She does the routine by herself...talks throughout the whole video...and brings up some good points.  Some people find her talking irritating but I decided to take the ""glass half full"" way and look at it as motivation.  This is the best 30 minutes I could devote to exercise!  I'll report back after I get further into this.  I also bought the 4 mile Walk Away the Pounds Express DVD...and when I'm ready I'll do that one and review it.

1083669,5,6305859612,"Before I got this video I was not really into ""exercise"", but her commercials always looked upbeat and relatively easy, so I gave her a try.  All I can say is WOW!  Im so glad I did.  Leslie Sansone's workouts have changed my life, and it all started with this one! It was extremely easy to follow, and I felt great everytime I did it.  I also started to see results immediately.  I had been dieting for 10 weeks before I got her video, and I had stalled in my weight loss.  Once I started doing her workout every other day, the pounds started coming off again.  I was able to meet my goal, and keep that goal maintained.  She opened up a whole new world for me.  Now I go to a health club several times a week, and work out with weights. Although I haved moved on to the next level of fitness, her videos are the best place for a beginner who is struggling with weight loss, to start.

1083670,5,6305859612,"When I was diagnosed with diabetes and told to lose weight, I wilted because it seemed impossible to lose all that abdominal fat,especially since I had come to dislike exercise in my obese state.  Also, with the onset of winter and slippery walking conditions my favorite exercise seemed to be a difficult choice.  But Leslie's tapes solved all those problems.  What I like best about them is (1) there are a minimum of moves to master and (2) the pacing is perfect; just as you think you can't do any more of a move, she gets you back to the basic walk which gets your energy and strength back so that you're ready for the next variation.  Also the timing of 30 minutes fits easily into a busy schedule.  (I have even adapted her workout to be used with Peter Jennings' newscast, using the commercial breaks to do 3 reps of 2 flights of stairs each during commercials.)  I heartily recommend this tape, especially knowing that if it gets too tame, there's a three mile tape to which to graduate.  By the way, I've lost 20 lbs. in two months.",1039651200,38,1042,4.4526315789473685

I really like this tape AND I'll go and get another of Leslie's tapes (for variety) because she motivated me. I'm 45 and busy constantly with work and because I belong to way too many organizations, so finding time to walk on my terms is tough. This is great. Leslie talks to me - encourages me to set the alarm for 5 am, drink a little coffee while I let the dog out and put on some exercise clothes and do a half-hour of exercise before showering for work. It makes you sweat and offers cross-training, using 1-lb hand or glove weights and your living room floor. The lunges are a little tough in bare feet on the living room carpet at 5 am but I'm know from the way I feel I'll be seeing a difference in  my appearance soon. Another great bonus, my asthma has actually improved! You go, Leslie!",1036713600,12,961,4.194594594594594
1083692,4,6305859612,"I've done this tape 12 times in the last 15 days.  I don't find it particularly entertaining, but I've lost four pounds in two weeks and I've gotten motivated to start looking at other forms of exercise.  For someone like me--a die-hard couch potato who hasn't exercised at all in six months--this tape is great:  it's simple, easy to follow, and meets its own goals.  Leslie Sansone says at the beginning of the tape that she's just here to keep you moving at a brisk pace for the length of the workout and that's what she does.  Nothing fancy.
It isn't just marching in place, though.  Aerobic intervals are interspersed with strength-training intervals (all done with 1 or 2 lb weights).  The aerobics include side-steps, mini-squats, a forward-tap step and something that looks like that drill team move where the whole team carries their pom-poms by their waists and imitates prancing horses.  Strength-training relies heavily on lunges and squats.  It's a basic workout for beginners that still makes you sweat.
The only downside to this tape is that Leslie Sansone doesn't do a careful enough job of teaching form.  Though she gives lip-service to protecting your joints, if you have any real joint problems you may want to pause the tape when she introduces the lunges and squats and make sure that your form and stance match hers.  As a person who is recovering from a shoulder injury, I find I have to be very careful about the upper body movements as well.  Still, as Leslie says, this is a work-out that's ""ready when you're ready"" and worth the simplicity for its results.",1035417600,48,1585,4.7655677655677655

I was expecting to be discouraged after the first routine, but Leslie keeps you motivated.  She targets key problem areas of the body and those lunges really [work]!  You're not bopping all around your living room doing this video.  This is definitely for the low key exerciser.  You do get a great workout and work up a nice sweat.  The length is approximately 30 minutes.  Just enough time to not bore you after awhile.  She moves into each exercise at a steady pace which allows you to keep up with her.

There are no dance steps to grasp, just simple movements that pack a big punch!! I've been using this tape for about 2 weeks now and am unbelievably satisfied!

I would recommend this tape to someone who has not exercised in several, several months and/or who is very obese. In the weeks that I have been using it I have been able to add 3lb dumbell for upper body toning and ankle weights. Also I might mention Leslie explains to if you want to burn more go deeper when squatting. I would say to everyone this tape would be a waste if you exercise on a inter/advance level.

I would not call this typical because heavier people tend to lose the first part of their weight fast. I do not think I will ever become discouraged because Leslie is so insperational.

Yes, walking is simple, but not the kind if walking Leslie Sansone is talking about. Her CD's are excellent. I think I have watched and completed more exercises with her CD than any other. She starts with a warm up that is fairly simple to complete, than we move on to more definitive action. A kick here, an arm rotation there, a side step, and then repeats of ten and then twenty. We move on to kore complete walking workouts with weights. As we walk and exercise, we do with Leslie and her group. She gives us suggestions, urges us on. If we get tired, she gives us an alternative, which I really appreciate.

For those who have not exercised in awhile, I urge you to try this CD. Give her a chance, I really appreciated the help and she does this in increments, at your pace. No one is watching you, you are the guide.

I was intrigued by this one, with the added strength component (using the light hand weights) and decided it was worth a try. I had been looking for a 2 mile indoor walking DVD for a while. This one did not disappoint.

It's fun, it gives you a really good workout and in no time at all, you're done!

 Leslie has a nice, upbeat approach and pleasant voice (don't you just hate when exercise instructors have harsh grating voices!) that keeps the time passing quickly.

I did not have the hand weights when I started using this video but now have found a 1 lb. set of these gloves at Amazon to use.

7896447,3,6305859612,"""Fat Burner Walk"" is not quite what I expected but I still thought it was OK. Leslie is walking alone in this DVD unlike many of her DVD workouts where she walks with a bunch of friends. She alternates walking and side steps with squats and lunges. You do enough to make your muscles burn but not enough to exhaust yourself. This is a very gentle workout but if you have knee problems you probably want to avoid it. If you are however looking for a mild upper body workout then this might be perfect. As you can see in the picture weights are used to boost the walking. If you don't have the glove weights like Leslie has you can use regular weights.

7896448,5,6305859612,"I have always lived by the Kiss (Keep it Simple Stupid) philosophy.  Leslie Sansone's Walk & Firm Fat Burner video makes exercising fun and easy, but at the same time extremely effective.  She doesn't waste your time practicing dance moves, floor routines or complicated karate kicks.  She simply keeps you moving.  If you can walk, you can do this program.

She also uses intervals that don't look like they will work, but let me tell you you feel the difference the next day.  This is not the new craze of extreme exercise (i.e. P90X).  This is a very commonsense approach to get your 30 minutes of exercise in when you are limited for time.  The first week with the help of a balanced diet I lost 7 lbs.

If you are an average guy or girl this is the tape for you.  If you are someone who already is running marathons or are into very challenging routines, this will probably be too easy for you.

However, if you just want to lose weight and be fit, this is a great way to do it.

I loved this tape so much I recently bought more of her DVDs to switch things up.

The problem I had with some of the other popular exercise tapes is that because I work nights. during the week I'm usually sleep deprived, I need something that I can stick with.  The other popular programs are just too boring and intense to get me motivated enough to do.  This program is different in a sense because it's fun and not so intense where you cringe when you think about doing it.  However, by the end of the tape I always need a towel because I break a nice sweat without feeling like I'm going to die.

In other words because of this sensible program, I am finally sticking to a 5 day a week exercise habit.  With the other tapes, I never lasted more than a couple of weeks.  I can easily see this becoming a way of life for me.

Thank you Leslie for thinking of us regular people who still want to be in shape.",1294185600,4,1895,4.211111111111111
7896449,5,6305859612,"It was a VERY black day at my house when the VHS local library version of this terrific workout (which I'd borrowed several hundred times!) finally died - and I went to pop in the copy I thought I'd cunningly transferred to a back-up dvd - and the copy was a total dud.

In my opinion, Leslie can be an exasperating exercise goddess. Sometimes adorable and inspiring, occasionally a tiny bit robotic and - very, very occasionally, she looks as though she got dressed in the dark & is stringing together moves as she goes along.

However, I forgive her because she has repackaged that terrific workout & I just bought it (full price) by accident! The familiar music of that busted VHS tape started - for a minute I didn't dare hope - but, yes, it's that very same brilliant golden oldie!

Funnily enough, it's not a flawless routine. Leslie flubs a couple of moves, there are some odd changes of pace and the cool down could be much longer. This doesn't matter. She does an outstanding job of correcting any bad habits you might have picked up, there is a truly diverting variety of steps and - best of all - it's so well designed, you can adjust the level of intensity YOU want, depending on how you feel that day -or how long you've been embarking on the New, Improved You!

Basically, this is my touchstone routine.
I like the one-on-one format (""Just you and me!"" says Leslie, sweetly), because sometimes I get distracted by the odd member of her ""gang"" on her other dvds - for trivial reasons (I can't stand the face someone makes - stupid stuff, I know).

If there is a better all-levels Leslie Sansone dvd out there - one that somehow doesn't get stale AND produces actual results, I've yet to find it.",1279584000,6,1708,4.479099678456592
