Treasure is a ham fest that seemed to be a lower budget family friendly version of Goonies.  So naturally you can understand why this movie was so funny.

Being that it is only on VHS perhaps buying it today via Amazon would be your best bet.  I lost my copy when I moved but I hope to stumble on another copy some day at a yard sale or church donation bin.

How good is this movie? Well the director himself took the time to write an Amazon review of it and he gave it 4 (out of 5) stars, so....",1405900800,3,667,4.084615384615384
7830891,5,630273469X,"I ALWAYS watched this movie after coming back from South Bend Washington, after camping with my mom and sister at the KOA camp-grounds down there, and boy it really set the mood. It's creepy in some parts, funny in others, this video is EXTREMELY rare, and you WILL NOT find anywhere else that I know of except for Amazon.... It's so good in my opinon, that I wish they would re-release it on DVD, or even better, make a sequel!",1146355200,,428,4.3625
7830892,5,630273469X,"Wow!!!  I don't even know where to start.  This movie is amazing.  This movie is a great adventure/mystery with a clever twist of humor. It's about how one boy's summer turns into the adventure of a lifetime. He, his best friend, and his cousin solve an age old mystery that has been haunting their town forever. The plot twists in this flm were stunning and kept me wondering what would happen next. I watch it all the time, and think it is a must see for any movie fanatic!",1052352000,,475,4.314606741573034
7830893,4,630273469X,"""Treasure"" is an mystery adventure family film (geared to ages 7-12) that takes you on a journey to find a long lost treasure along the seacoast.  The death of a lighthouse keeper,  several crazy antagonists, an old sea captain and three adventure seeking boys are some of the elements that are thrown together for an exciting mystery story.  Filmed along the coast in San Diego, the locations include Pt. Loma lighthouse, La Jolla Cove, Olivenhain Meeting Hall,and Old Town San Diego. I think you'll enjoy this fun kids film - and ask for a cheaper price while you're at it! I guess I'm somewhat biased in my review...for I'm the Director of ""Treasure""!",987120000,2,654,4.769911504424779
