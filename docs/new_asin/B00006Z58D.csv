7973429,5,B00006Z58D,"I hate lifting weights. Well, specifically, I hate doing sets and reps.  This tape is perfect for me, because I want to do an exercise and move on.  I have never pushed myself to exhaustion and it feels amazing.  I couldn't do 100 on each exercise but I know I will get there.  Katrina encourages you to start with the heaviest weight and then go down or even eliminate the weights...just finish the 100.  One upper body exercise you do 50, then do static lunges on one leg, finish the other 50 and then do the lunge on the other leg.  Sometimes you pulse, or lift fast, but she gets you to 100.  The only downside to this is there is no biceps exercise.  But I did one set afterward. (Even though I have the DVD, it is not chaptered. You can't skip to another exercise...you have to fast forward it.) In the future, I will either do biceps with the squats or lunges, or just backtrack, and do biceps after the last standing exercise, which I think is the lat row.
Overall, I highly recommend this workout for weight lifting haters like me!  At least, you'll get it done and be over with it.",1197417600,4,1091,4.282926829268293
7973430,5,B00006Z58D,"This workout is intense, but very effective.  Katrina is an excellent instructor; focused and straightforward.  This routine was taped in a gym, so there are no frills or fancy sets.  The workout makes you sweat, and Katrina's style of instruction pushes you and makes you work harder!

One of my best investments in a fitness routine.  I recommend this very highly!!!!",1168473600,3,369,4.983606557377049
7973431,4,B00006Z58D,"Katrina really gets me motivated. I feel stronger and look hot.

There are 14 different exercises so i don't get board. I highly recommend this workout video.",1136764800,,158,4.851851851851852
7973432,5,B00006Z58D,Totally no-nonsense! This makes the workout in Tae-bo seem pale in comparison. The workout is really tough & the instructor is very clear and doesn?t seem to mind working out like there?s no tomorrow. This video has helped me get stronger & has actually helped improve my overall conditioning tremendously! One of the best workout tapes out there!,1090281600,7,347,5.0
7973433,5,B00006Z58D,"What a gem of a tape. It's a grueling muscle endurance workout. It looks like she basically taped her class at a gym. The video starts out with a stretch. The instructor uses 10, 8, 5, and 3 pound weights. You start with the heaviest weight and when your form begins to suffer you lower the weight. The workout consists of 100 reps for 14 different exercises (e.g., squats, lunges, chest press, tricep extension, crunches, one-arm row, shoulder press, lateral raises, front raises, glute raises, etc.). You get a total body workout in about an hour. The only negative to the tape is there isn't enough stretching between exercises. That's a small negative in my opinion. This is keeper.",1051920000,11,686,4.773109243697479
