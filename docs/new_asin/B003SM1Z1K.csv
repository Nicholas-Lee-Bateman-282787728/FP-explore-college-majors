8404493,5,B003SM1Z1K,"This is the Live Concert that all Slayer fans had been waiting for. It had been a very long 8 years since Live Intrusion had been released & that had not made it onto DVD and the VHS version was super rare. What you have here is the absolute best of Slayer live doing what they do best......thrashing like a fish out of water. The Beast Sir Paul Bostaph is a Drum God & he lives up to this nickname and proves why we the Slayer elite refer to him as this. Uncle Tom makes playing Bass & growling the Vocals look immensely easy (and we all know it is not) KFK stomps around the stage commanding respect in his brash in your face way. As for Saint Jeffery of Hanneman he is the Devine axe wielding shredder that has drawn so many people in to the Slayer lifestyle. This is a stunning piece of what will soon become the Classic, legendary gig of fond memories. The up and coming Slayer fans of the next generations will behold this gig & THE definitive Slayer live show, as it should be.",1443139200,,984,4.184210526315789
