173863,5,0972597506,"i grew up with the ""man of action"" for so many years.
gi j was bar none the best action figure toyline ever
despite past competition from mego's micronauts or kenner's star wars line.
the doccumentary mostly centered who was behind the concept of joe. it was very informative and to me the real star of the show was joe himself, as in those tv ads. it brought back a lot of fond memories. i was glad that mitch (the  man behind the documentary) also included a brief segment regardind a cool but all-too-short toyline..SUPER JOE. which was suppossed to be the 12 inch counterpart's successor but unfortunetly didn't live up to expectations.
it was also good to see vp kirk bozigian, after all these years.
i had the honor of meeting him at the 30th gi joe aniversary 10 years ago.
all in all a cool retrospective on one of america's greatest icons.",1059350400,3,848,4.5064935064935066
173864,5,0972597506,"This is not a cheap promo knock-off. This is a serious, well-made documentary about the history and development of GI Joe. This documentary contains interviews with many of the men and women who created Joe, and their recollections are fascinating. The majority of this 2-hour documentary is focused on the creation of Joe... My only complaint is once we launch into the history of Joe, scant little time (maybe all of 5 minutes) is spent on the Adventure Team era (1970-77). How is possible to do a 2-hour documentary on GI Joe with no mention of Kung Fu Grip or Mike Powers Atomic Man? Still, I was pleased to see how much time was spent on the '80s 3-3/4 inch Real American Hero Joes, and I was very interested to learn the story being the triumphant return of the full-sized Joe in 1991.  So with my Adventure Team disappointment set aside (and maybe I'm only disappointed because this was my Joe era), I highly recommend this documentary to GI Joe fans and fans of baby boomer era toys.",1058918400,7,991,4.567415730337078
173865,5,0972597506,"This documentary is flawless with great detail going into its production. The visuals created by the filmmakers are outstanding, as well as the behind the scenes footage. Being able to put a face to the names of individuals that are responsible for Joe's existance makes the production even more personal. The extras, (original commercials, etc.), makes this an informative and entertaining documentary that puts GI Joe into perspective: he is a toy as well as an icon, and should be treated as both.  A must for all collectors as well as those who love nastolgia.",1044230400,2,564,4.936842105263158
173866,5,0972597506,"This is a top grade documentary.  Great care has obviously gone into its production; the visuals and sound track are excellent. I would highly recommend it- particularly to anyone with an interest in GI JOE, but I also think that it has wide appeal for all adults and children.  The interviews with Joe's creators and the stories they tell are fascinating and touching.  The vintage TV commercials and promotional films will give anyone who grew up in the 60's pangs of nostalgia.  It will also give the children of today a rare glimpse into the time when their parents and grandparents were children.  This is an upbeat, entertaining and informative film about an American icon and the heroes that made him possible.",1038528000,3,717,4.844262295081967

I recommend this to all g I joe collectors. This is a must have if your a serious collector. The birth of g I joe and the dedicated and brilliant group of people that brought it to life and gave thousands of us years and years of joy. Thank you Dan Levine, Sam spears and everyone at the Hasbro toy company.",1519516800,,454,4.0

7794484,4,0972597506,"I thought this was done VERY well. However, I was expecting more time given to the 80's joes. They only talked about them for just a couple minutes, if even that. I wish they had brought Larry Hama in and interviewed him, for his contribution to the Joes. This doc was more about the engineering, marketing, and sales of the 12 inch. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of information on the 3 3/4 JOES, which in my opinion kept the Name GI JOE alive even until today.",1460592000,,479,4.161290322580645

7794486,5,0972597506,"I got this for a collector friend. I wasn't so sure about it's informative value but once I saw it I understood. A nicely done documentary with lots of historical facts. I wish there was more about collecting and such... but I have to admit that maybe if they added that the whole thing will be ruined.

I will recommend it to any person. A walk thru memory lane is never a wasted one. ^_^",1375142400,,389,4.1866666666666665

7794488,5,0972597506,"EXCELLENT documentary! When it started, I thought it was going to be hokey and dull, with all the interviews etc, but it wasn't! The story was very well-written and intertwined interviews with people who were involved in the creation and development of Joe, with vintage commercials and industry footage, and views of the prototype figures and accessories. It follows the Joe story from inception in 1963 to current day conventions and collecting. I played with Joe as a kid and still have my original two Joes; this documentary was a wonderful trip down memory lane. I highly recommend this for anyone who played with Joe or collects Joe. They will love it!",1262649600,2,658,4.883928571428571
7794489,5,0972597506,"The first ""big kids"" toy I ever wanted was a GI Joe, and getting it may still be one of my fondest birthday memories.  What is it about the endless adventure possible in our pal, Joe?  Every aspect is explored in this documentary.  Not only was the toy conceptually risky, but the lengths that its creators went through to bring it to us are as astounding as Joe's adventures, themselves.  The unlikely subject of a toy line becomes a genuinely gripping, suspenseful, and honestly moving story about art, optimism, and the beauty of play.  I found myself emotionally engaged on numerous levels as the story of this piece of Americana was shared.  Fans of toys, nostalgia, business, and American culture will find much to love in this documentary.  I wish we could award six stars instead of five!",1240012800,2,796,4.72463768115942
