8559532,4,B00AZDXO8C,"I was very happy with the quality of the dvd & the songs.  Would have given it 5 stars or more if possible, however, it arrived in a case with no shrink wrap, corner of the case broken out at the top & the dvd was loose & sliding around in the case.  Lucky it wasn't damaged & played well.  It has been used & I wasn't informed I was buying a used item!  Five stars for content  but one for condition.  I want more music DVDs by Mr. Kimes & I want them new.  Please Amazon get some!",1494115200,,482,3.808080808080808
8559533,1,B00AZDXO8C,"The video would have been great as I love everything Royal Wade Kimes does, but it arrived in a cover that looked like it had been used (broken closure clips) and it skips throughout the video. This video had some pretty rough useage before I got it and is virtually useless to me.",1389744000,,281,4.320754716981132
8559534,5,B00AZDXO8C,As a proud Marine who has 13 Confederate ancestors I watch this movie and see what they felt like during the War Between the States. Royal Wade Kimes  really showed the emotion that all Veterans have felt coming home whether coming home as a flag or in person. I am glad someone has finally put in a movie and in song what most Veterans feel coming home. THANKS a BUNCH!,1378339200,,370,4.285714285714286
8559535,5,B00AZDXO8C,This production brings the civil war to life.  The music and video together tell a heart wrenching story that effected all Americans in one way or another.  Royal Wade Kimes has a voice like no other.  You cannot watch and hear this without feeling the pain.  I highly recommend watching this.,1375660800,,293,4.686274509803922
