8760924,4,B01FKI8O04,Nice quality fireplace and aquarium. Only downside is you have to switch dvds to get one or the other. Would have preferred a single DVD with multiple options,1484006400,,158,4.678571428571429
8760925,3,B01FKI8O04,Was disappointed. Expected it to be high definition but the picture lacked definition and clarity.. I have another fireplace DVD from Walmart that was cheaper but a little better picture quality/more realistic.,1482883200,,210,5.59375

8760927,5,B01FKI8O04,"Great value for money! The colors are so bright and vivid and the sound options are perfect. I love it that I can choose the right sounds and video for the mood Im in or the company Im with.
The Aquarium DVD has two refreshing and colorful aquariums with beautiful and playful fish. You can choose to play the videos with lovely music, water sounds or the bubbly aquarium sound.
The Fireplace disc offers one really bright fire with glowing orange flames and a softer, romantic fire. Both fires burn down completely ending with soft glowing embers, just like a real fire. The beautiful piano music is so relaxing that a special night is guaranteed. Its also possible to play the videos with the real sounds of a crackling fire.  It sounds weird, I know, but when Im playing the fireplace videos it actually seems warmer in my living room.",1474329600,4,838,4.586666666666667

8760929,5,B01FKI8O04,Great value.  Two DVDs with quality HD sharp imagery and brilliant color.  Realistic sounds with two fires to choose from and two aquariums with colorful fish and plants.  I enjoy watching the fires as they burn down like an actual fire would do.  This would make a great background in a professional office instead of annoying talk shows or soap operas while your customers wait for their appointment.,1464220800,3,402,4.867647058823529
