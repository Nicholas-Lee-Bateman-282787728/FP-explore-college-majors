3521496,3,B001D11A4A,This was a short lived series but was well done.  Henry Fonda was the draw for this series but I beleive that Allan Case carried the  series because he was the constant character.  Henry Fonda's character would come and go but the Deputy was always present in the story lines.,1240531200,,276,4.48
3521497,2,B001D11A4A,"This set from Timeless Media is pretty poor...of the first 3 episodes, an apology for poor quality precedes 2...as well there are only 12 total episodes...pretty rich at over $30...too bad NBC Universal chose to put their name on this...I expect better from that brand...I would be cautious of Timeless Media products in the future...bottom line, you've really got to love The Deputy for this to be worthwhile...unfortuately for me, I do...",1235433600,6,440,5.125
3521498,2,B001D11A4A,You'd think a western tv series starring Henry Fonda would have to be good right? WRONG! Very disappointing. And who's bright idea was it to give a western series a jazz soundtrack. What a mess.,1233100800,7,194,4.571428571428571
3521499,3,B001D11A4A,"After fifty years, it must be difficult to get the original material to put out a set like this, and Timeless is up-front about the quality of the shows, and no where did I see anything about 'complete' season. It is 12 episodes, as stated on the box (the wrong # of running minutes is pretty easy to figure out, if it is 12 half hour shows...must be a misprint!).
Sure there are a couple of shows that are pretty sub-par, but I'm just glad to have The Deputy on DVD, since it never runs in my area, and I haven't seen it since the sixties.
I love Henry Fonda, and even though the show is uneven, and isn't the best western of the period, it stands up as a good example of early TV westerns.
By the way, check out the other titles Timeless puts out, like Laredo, Laramie and Wagon Train. And another great tv show, M-Squad, with Lee Marvin, the cop show that set the standard for cop shows.",1232668800,2,890,4.180232558139535
3521500,1,B001D11A4A,"Sadly, I must agree with the majority of reviewers. This series does not translate well. It lacks focus in its directing, tension in its writing and the picture quality is rather poor. Too bad, as it is from 1959. Fonda must have indeed needed the money and it was, as was written, ""an easy gig"" for him. Nice performance by Allen Case, who sadly never did much more on screen, but did have his moments on(off?) Broadway and unfortunately died in his fifties of a heart-attack. And Robert Redford has a nice guest spot in one episode, but still it is not worth the asking price. Incidentally, I bought my set for $19.99 from a local retailer. So $31.99 is definitely out of line!
How about a set of Bat Masterson?! And this time re-master it!!!",1231200000,8,744,4.477941176470588
3521501,1,B001D11A4A,only 12 episodes and very poor quality. some i cant even watch. do not buy!!,1230422400,6,76,4.133333333333334
3521502,1,B001D11A4A,Some of the episodes are ok but 2 of them are virtually unviewable. I have always been pleased with the quality of material put out by TIMELESS but this is far below there standards. They claim these are the best prints they could find of the episodes but I cannot believe this as there collectors out there with 16mm copies of lots of things. I accept that due to the age of the material imperfections are expected but this collection is one of the worst I have come across. Get back to the good work you do TIMELESS and lets have no more like this!,1227398400,7,550,4.247619047619048
3521503,2,B001D11A4A,"The Deputy was a 30 minute television western that was on NBC for two seasons in the late fifties. Henry Fonda was billed as the star of the series which was a major coup because he was still a major star of the silver screen. The truth is that he was rarely the central character. The title of the show was The Deputy which means it focused more on Allen Case's character, Clay McCord. Simon Fry was a U.S. Marshall that relied on McCord to fill as a peace officer when the need arose.

There are twelve episodes on three discs with more episodes coming from the second season. There are a few differences in cast between the two seasons. The first season had an aging town Marshall, Herk Lemson (Wallace Ford) & Clay's sister, Fran (Betty Lou Keim). In the first season Clay owned a general store & that was how he made a living. He was assisted in running it by his sister. In one episode his store is burned down & he's left without his main source of income. The second season finds him taking over as the town Marshall of Silver City, gone is his sister & the aging Lemson. Also added to the cast was the character of Sarge (Read Morgan) who helped McCord in his duties.

As to Henry Fonda, I don't know how or why he got roped into doing this series. It's reminiscent of his movie, The Tin Star, yet there are some differences. In the vast majority of episodes Simon Fry would appear for two or three minutes at the beginning of the show & then the same thing at the end of each show. In these twelve episodes only once is Simon Fry the main focus. So for Fonda this had to be an easy gig.

As to the quality of these episodes, buyer beware. They haven't been remastered & the quality of the video is only so-so. As other reviewers have mentioned two of the episodes are in such bad shape that there is a disclaimer at the beginning of those particular episodes. The rest are watchable but there are a lot of problems in the film.

There are some good guest stars in these episodes, the biggest one is Robert Redford though he was still several years away from star status. There's also James Coburn who already had a name but had yet to achieve star status. There are Edgar Buchanan, Alan Hale, Jr. (Skipper from Gilligan's Island), Elisha Cook, Jr. & Whitney Blake.

This set is overpriced but, fortunately, I got it through another seller through Amazon & it was considerably less. The product info lists that this set is 414 minutes; I have no clue where that figure comes from. The episodes put together are approximately 300 minutes; there aren't any bonus features, even if you throw in the logos & show opening you still don't get close to 414 minutes. Unless you're a big fan of The Deputy my recommendation is that you should pass on this set.",1226966400,38,2760,4.372319688109162
3521504,3,B001D11A4A,"I agree with the previous review about the quality of the show itself, and will keep the set. But I think details of this set have changed in cdnow/amazon since it was first announced. Earlier description, I think, made it sound like this was a complete series, though I can't prove that. A mere 12 episodes for $30+ is not satisfactory. I will follow up on descriptions more closely now, and THIS IS THE LAST PRODUCT I WILL EVER BUY FROM TIMELESS MEDIA.
Now that I have started watching the set I must add I should have rated it Zero Stars and I wish I had returned the product without taking the wrapper off. I don't know how NBC-Universal ever allowed their name to be associated with this. Adding insult to injury, the quality is so-so on most episodes, even with Timeless' claim to be using the best available source material and state-of-the-art processing. Two of the paltry 12 episodes have disclaimers apologizing for the poor quality! The episodes 'Man of Peace' and 'Hidden Motives' both have the warning and the first is so dark and blurry it's hard to watch. Also, the episodes run no more than 23-24 minutes each so they are probably edited versions. That makes for a total of 288 minutes, not approx. 418 as claimed. Timeless has some hard to find series on dvd, but if you want to see them I suggest subscribing to Netflix. That way you are not stuck with such lousy products.",1223942400,48,1392,4.549800796812749
3521505,3,B001D11A4A,"THE DEPUTY is an excellent TV Western, at least 4 Stars for the show itself. About 3 for the DVD set because I understand there's only 12 episodes on it. Any 12 are worth having, tho, so I'm going to buy it and hope for more later. I've heard Henry Fonda was miserable doing it but his work, as a supporting actor, doesn't suffer. Allen Case as the deputy Clay McCord was perfect casting. The rest of the regulars are solid too and the guest stars include a number of big names to be. Well worthwhile.

  An update. I just finished watching the twelve THE DEPUTY episodes. I enjoyed them but most are not the best shows. I especially had hoped to get a copy of the one where the deputy broke the unbreakable moral code and purposely killed a man by purposely shooting him in the back, but it wasn't one of them. Also, the inclusion of the two episodes with VERY poor picture quality is inexplicable. Several years ago one of the cable stations played THE DEPUTY and plenty of good quality episodes exists.",1222992000,22,1005,4.39247311827957
