3913833,5,B002DY9KRK,"Ian McShane one of the greatest actors who should've had a much bigger
career in America but Lovejoy is one of the greatest series of all time! His
charm wit comedic acting is what made the series so great! It should've lasted
longer but then again some series go too long! The ending is one of the best
written endings to any series in tv history! great writing directing and acting.
It's not my favorite season of the series but they are all great.",1392336000,3,450,4.369047619047619
3913834,5,B002DY9KRK,"Great show .I grew up around the area the show is set in,so i love to see all the places i know and have passed through. Plus Ian McShane is always a treat to watch!",1386633600,,165,3.742857142857143
3913835,5,B002DY9KRK,"Lovejoy is a wonderfully crafted series about the shenanigans in the art and antiques world.  It is funny and very tongue in cheek.  We bought the entire series from Amazon.com. Although we are Anglophiles, this series was shown on American television for all to enjoy.  It is even close captioned for those who have trouble understanding the Queen's English. Great ensemble cast!  We highly recommend Lovejoy for laughs and for learning about what really goes on in the antiques trade.  Ian McShane was well casted as Lovejoy.",1334793600,,527,5.011494252873563
3913836,2,B002DY9KRK,"Never liked the Eric character, love the Beth character of the later episodes.  But I don't recall Lovejoy treating anyone badly in the earlier episodes - he certainly does in the Season six series.  Now, I know that this is more in keeping with the Lovejoy of Jonathan Gash, but that persona is not what endeared so many to the television series and that Lovejoy character.

The relationship between Charlotte and Lovejoy is completely annoying; and Charlotte is often incredibly stupid.  The Lady Jane character was, at minimum, an understanable one, as was her relationship to Lovejoy.  And, that episode where Charlotte allows the total jerk to rule her home and life - and he's just popped up from nowhere?  Phooey.

I tried to go with the flow of these script changes, but I just don't like 'em.",1296777600,4,801,4.760869565217392
3913837,5,B002DY9KRK,"As Ian McShane himself states ""Lovejoy is no angel, but he's on the side of the angels.""
Lovejoy is an English antique dealer with the ability to ""divine"" real antiques from fakes.
Despite employing all his inate skills to win at the buying and selling game - he always comes out the loser. Lovejoy, is a loveable rogue of an antique dealer who accidentally finds himself solving the odd crime along the way. The Lovejoy series is perfect ""feel good"" entertainment. If you liked ""Midsomer Murders"", ""Foyle's War"" or ""Pie in the Sky"" you will definitely get a good chuckle from Lovejoy and along the way you will learn a heck of a lot about antiques.",1266364800,7,649,4.603448275862069

3913839,4,B002DY9KRK,"Honestly, Ian McShane and Dudley Sutten could make a phone book fun. But it is too bad the episodes could not have been casted in the oposite order, then we could have watched as a good show became wonderful. Instead, we watched an enchanting show lose some of it's magic after Lady Jane and Eric left the cast.",1262995200,6,311,4.379310344827586
3913840,3,B002DY9KRK,"By the time of this series, my two favorite characters (Lady Felsham and Eric) had left the series.  That reduce the entertainment level for me by at least 1/2.",1250985600,18,160,4.517241379310345
3913841,5,B002DY9KRK,"Got hooked on this series while stationed in England.  Come Tuesday evening at 8PM, everything stopped to watch Lovejoy on BBC.  Ian MacShane is brilliant as Lovejoy.  He is cool, suave, debonair and just down right hunky.  Lovejoy is a series that one can sit down and enjoy with the entire family.  Was over the moon when amazon.com started offering the series.  A bit pricey but well worth the money.  Since Lovejoy, Ian has also cut quite a swath here in the U.S. with various and sundry series (such as Deadwood) as well as appearing in numerous movies.  Too bad they cancelled his ""Kings"" before it even had a chance.  Oh well, long live Lovejoy!",1248220800,19,652,4.6
3913842,5,B002DY9KRK,"These is a series I was very, very sorry to see end.  I'm so glad to have the complete set of DVDs now.  This is a remarkably good series, which I recommend to everyone.  Excellent acting.  I think the show lost a lot of ""umph"" when Lady Jane and Eric left the show, but the last episodes are very good too and for different reasons.  The departure of Lovejoy at the end of the series brings tears to my eyes --- I had a long and enjoyable friendship with these people.",1440979200,,469,4.1098901098901095

3913844,1,B002DY9KRK,"It is sad, for those of us who enjoy simple escapism, that the last series departs so much from the things which made this series innocent fun.  There are much better action detectives.  Why copy that genre and ruin the reason for Lovejoy?
For a Lovejoy fan, a total waste of money.",1433030400,,282,4.403846153846154

8366300,5,B002DY9KRK,"This is the last of 6 seasons of a great comedic mystery series.
The Lovejoy cadre has changed. It's now Lovejoy, Charlotte, Beth and Tinker.
There may be people who disagree with me, but I liked the non-Hollywood ending to Season 6. I'm not sure the leopard would have been happy for long changing his spots.

...1... ""Fair Exchange"" Lovejoy is in serious financial difficulty, which makes him unnecessarily  mean to Beth. It doesn't help when a suspicious-looking couple sell Charlotte a 1790 painting by Orlowski, which is immediately stolen. Lovejoy tries to help and suddenly he is in serious legal difficulty. What is it about people framing Lovejoy?
...2... ""Day of Reckoning"" Tinker and Lovejoy get to an auction just in time to see Lot 39 brought up, ""a late 19th century carved ivory chess set."" It's cream and red and Lovejoy recognizes it immediately. He just got paid on a big sale, so he bids on the chess set. Tink is puzzled, ""Lovejoy! 12,000  why?"" Lovejoy isn't obsessed, but there's a killer obsessed with him.
This episode is lots of fun, written like an old-fashioned murder mystery.
...3... ""Somewhere  Over the Rainbow?"" Tinker has disappeared. Is it because Lovejoy was appallingly rude to him? Mid-life crisis? No, it's more poignant. His sister, to whom he hasn't spoken in 20 years, is in danger of losing her Devon hotel to debts. Can Lovejoy save the day?
Trivia, the real hotel location used is, in real life, on Burgh Island, famously believed to be Agatha Christie's inspiration for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-Then-There-Were-None/dp/B01A9IV54W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">And Then There Were None</a>.
...4... ""Double-Edged Sword"" Lovejoy tells us why he and Beth are delivering a chair to a rented cottage: ""Jim Leonard, my old coach.... He's rented a house here for a while; we're helping him furnish it. You must remember Jim, last time I was left with egg on my face. [That was episode ""They Call Me Midas"", Season 4.].... Revenge is a dish best served cold.""
To get his mind off how to get even with Jim, Lovejoy is ""invited"" to a gangster's house for a job.
...5... ""Guns and Roses"" Tinker and Lovejoy go to Soho, London, to the shop of George Wilson, ""Bespoke Gunsmith"", for restoration work on a couple of guns. They are interrupted by an arrogant agent of Burgess Entertainment, Ltd. They just bought the building and they want their old renters, like Wilson, out. By hook or by crook or by framing him for armed robbery.
...6... ""The Last of the Uzkoks"" Lovejoy tells us, ""In the late Middle Ages, a tribe of Christian pirates, known as the Uzkoks, roamed the Adriatic. In 1680 ...  their priest fashioned a valuable communion set out of looted silver."" And it's coming up for auction, but there's a dispute. Does it matter if the set was stolen  200 years ago?
This is a GREAT story that comes around in a full circle. And you get to meet Charlie Gimble's father, which is a hoot.
Trivia: In real life, the Uskoks (maybe Uzkoks is an alternative spelling) started out as Hapsburg military units guarding the frontier with the Ottoman Empire. Unfortunately, they weren't paid and resorted to piracy.
...7... ""Breaking the Broker"" The Harbor Patrol boards Captain Sidelski's boat, but has to leave without the antique smuggling evidence it hoped for. ""According to the Assistant Divisional Head of Criminal Militia, North Gdansk, that man is bleeding Poland dry, nicking its history."" The police agree that what they need is an expert in art, conniving, smuggling and other tricks. Guess who?!
...8... ""Fruit of the Desert"" Lovejoy is put in touch with Harold Plumb, a retired diplomat, who wants to sell some Middle East antiques he picked up in his travels. Tink and Lovejoy go to meet Plumb, but before he shows them the loot, um... items, starts out with, ""First, I want to give you a small treatise on diplomatic protocol.... This is for your own good.""
If something sounds too good to be true...!
...9... ""Holding the Baby"" Charlotte agrees to babysit the infant, Henry, for her best friend. She argues (with herself?): ""I'm the godmother. It's no trouble.... Why shouldn't I have a baby? I mean, look after one, I mean."" Once again, Lovejoy almost has the deal of his life.
..10.. ""Last Tango in Lavenham"" Yes, there are antiques involved in this last episode. But most of it has to do with good-byes. Tinker has a pub on Burgh Island (see episode 3, ""Somewhere  Over the Rainbow?"") and admits to Lovejoy, ""I've come to the end of the road in this game. Tired feet, tired liver."" Beth has been offered a dream job at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (we knew she was smart). Jane returns for just a visit with a big surprise. Even Eric shows up. And Charlotte has been offered a job in New York City. To say anything more would be a spoiler.

Season 6 of ""Lovejoy"" originally aired October to December 1994. Its 10 episodes total 470 minutes of merriment and seriousness. The DVD presents them in 4:3 aspect ratio and English subtitles are available on the episodes and the single Bonus Feature.
... Bonus... ""Ian McShane Talks About Lovejoy: Part 6"" (9 minutes) A 2004 interview with McShane, who plays Lovejoy, is divided into six parts. One part appears on each of the six Season sets.
Of the last episode, McShane says, ""I loved it. I hated it because it was the last show and because it had Phillis [Logan, who plays Jane].... It was bittersweet.""

Good bye, Lovejoy.
