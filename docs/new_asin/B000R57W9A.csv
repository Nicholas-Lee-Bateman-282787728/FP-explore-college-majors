2858411,5,B000R57W9A,"VCI Entertainment and Kit Parker Films present ""HAMMER FILM NOIR COLLECTOR'S SET 2: 4-7"" --- (Dolby digitally remastered)...Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.

First up we have ""TERROR STREET"" (1953) (80 min. B/W) --- Under Montgomery Tully (Director), Anthony Hinds (Producer), Steve Fisher (Screenplay & Story), Ivor Slaney (Original Score), Malcolm Arnold (Stock Music), Walter J.

Duryea is at the top of his game in this British melodrama, as you find yourself completely engulfed in his character and waiting for the next scene to unravel another clue and clear himself ... can he find the real killer before the police track his whereabouts and bring in the wrong suspect ... the scenes between Duryea and John Chandos (the major villain) are riveting.

8198888,4,B000R57W9A,"4 out of 5 stars for this DVD set that dusts off a grip of obscure Hammer film noir pictures. 3 stars for 1954's The Unholy Four, the movie I'm chatting you up about.

It's not that The Unholy Four is bad. I enjoyed watching it. But let's not front, The Unholy Four isn't a timeless classic like, oh, I dunno, Double Indemnity, Laura, or The Postman Always Rings Twice. Now some purists posit that film noir should only be inhabited by them what haunt society's seedy underbelly. TCM host Robert Osborne defines film noir as a blend of ""corrupt people, crime, and sex,"" and I'm down with that. Seems to me that ""corrupt people"" also encompass the privileged, entitled 1%. And it's such with The Unholy Four.

Based on actor George Sanders' novel, Stranger at Home - although there float whispers that the thing was actually ghost written by the prolific Leigh Brackett - the hub of the plot is English executive Philip Vickers (William Sylvester) who, after four years of mysterious absence, vengefully returns home only to find himself in the thick of a festive house party. Vickers claims that four years ago he was brutally attacked and so incurred amnesia whilst on a Portuguese fishing excursion. He'd recovered his memory only a year ago and had spent the rest of the time getting his bearings. Home now, Vickers, sporting a nasty scar on his brow, harboring deepset paranoia, lets fly with his accusations. He claims his assailant was someone on the fishing trip with him, some chum.

But put on pause that bit of lurid melodrama. Home now, Vickers becomes suspect when one of his associates gets himself bumped off by the boathouse. Inspector Treherne (Russell Napier) is on the case. And Inspector Treherne, chasing down clues like a world-weary bulldog, is one of the best things about this movie.

So an above average 3 out of 5 stars for The Unholy Four. Not even the occasional flat exposition can weigh down this moody British-made whodunit. It's enacted by a veteran international cast, although I shan't raise an eyebrow if the only name you recognize is Paulette Goddard. Goddard, even in the twilight of her career, can still muster up that va-va-voom. By turns demure and mildly distressed and wildly agitated, she plays Angie Vickers, our man's possibly unfaithful wife. As the tortured Vickers, William Sylvester is borderline unlikeable, lobbing his accusations as if they were word grenades, trying to get a stir out of whoever. No, it's not the most subtle investigative method. Except his indiscrimate kicking of the hornet's nest prompts two murders, not to mention animosity from his wife, her frazzled secretary (Alvys Maben), and other old associates.

Put yourself in the man's place, though. What he endures must seem like a nightmarish episode from Alfred Hitchcock Presents or The Twilight Zone. Good odds that English executive Philip Vickers is well and truly barmy and a danger to others. And I love that flavor of uncertainty. The Unholy Four gives you people who covet what ain't theirs, people who murder and lie and cheat with no remorse. The Unholy Four meets Robert Osborne's criteria for film noir. Most film noir pictures I've seen, they don't give a what for diabollically clever sleuthing. More often, it's our compromised anti-hero slugging a confession out of some mug. And The Unholy Four serves that up, as well.

Now if only someone would make a movie out of George Sanders' other book, Ennui & Me.

Okay, he never wrote a book titled Ennui & Me. But, dammit, he should've.",1403568000,,3524,4.853577371048253

8198890,3,B000R57W9A,"These mostly all okay, and some interesting stories.  However, Glass Tomb not very great, but I really didn't expect that.  Trumpet in Black Glove SUPER IMPRESSIVE.  Unholy Four one of best, and A Race for Life w/Richard Conte not so great.  However, for the money, is okay to interest one when TV has nothing of interest.  All 4 discs (8 movies) okay except Deadly Game has two small places where hum is detected, but not enough to ruin the movie.

8198891,2,B000R57W9A,"I'm a big fan of noir films, but I have to say these are the most boring things I have seen in quite a while.",1307836800,,109,3.4
8198892,3,B000R57W9A,"VCI's second set of Hammer Film Noir contains 2 more movies (8 in all) but they are not as good as Volume 1 and the last one, A RACE FOR LIFE, isn't even a noir at all. Having said that, this set is still worthwhile as you get to see more fading American stars (Dan Duryea, Paulette Goddard, John Ireland, and Zachary Scott) and more of Terence Fisher's early work (THE BLACK GLOVE, A RACE FOR LIFE, THE UNHOLY FOUR, WINGS OF DANGER). Everyone of these films was renamed for the American market (they were released in England as FACE THE MUSIC, MASK OF DUST, THE STRANGER CAME HOME and DEAD ON COURSE) and they played the bottom half of a double bill. One of them, BLACK GLOVE (FACE THE MUSIC), is well written and directed with a great 50s jazz score while THE UNHOLY FOUR (THE STRANGER CAME HOME) is a halfway decent mystery. As one would expect from Fisher, these four are the most visually interesting of the set.

Regarding the other four, three (THE GLASS TOMB, PAID TO KILL, TERROR STREET) were directed by Montgomery Tully who is compensated for his minimum running times (GLASS TOMB is 59 minutes) by being given the more interesting storylines. PAID TO KILL is a minor suspense classic while THE GLASS TOMB gets the award for the most bizarre plot with a sideshow performer starving himself while people pay to watch. THE DEADLY GAME was directed by Daniel Birt and features a young Lloyd Bridges (before SEA HUNT) caught up with smugglers. Today it's easy to see how much his son Jeff resembles him. With the exception of A RACE FOR LIFE, I thoroughly enjoyed these movies for their up close look at post-WW II Britain and for seeing how creative the filmmakers could be with their extremely low budgets. Classic noir it ain't, but it's still not bad and should keep you entertained especially if you're a fan of British films.",1269820800,7,1838,4.552870090634441
8198893,4,B000R57W9A,"As film noir goes I have seen better, still worth having.  The first set was much better, especially the under rated singer and film star DIANA DORS. By all means get her SWINGING DORS CD.",1266364800,2,188,4.371428571428571
8198894,4,B000R57W9A,"This collector's set is a preview of the glory that was Hammer. All of the films were made in the early fifties before Hammer broke into the big time with THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955) and CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), but they demonstrate the talent that made Hammer into the greatest horror filmmakers ever. None of these is a horror film, but the Gothic atmosphere is everywhere, as Hammer filmed all of their features at that time in the Bray manor house. Alert viewers will notice familiar fireplaces, staircases and doorways that made it into their classic horrors. Their best director, of course, was the great Terence Fisher, and check out THE UNHOLY FOUR in this set to see what the Master could do with very little money. Also showcased is the underrated director Montgomery Tully, who does a bang-up job with PAID TO KILL, a convoluted and gripping story expertly told. But somebody must tell Kit Parker Films that Fisher did NOT direct GORGO; they repeat this mistake in every bio on both the first and second Hammer Film Noir collections! Aside from that gaffe, though, these are wonderful films, beautifully packaged, that are finally receiving the audiences they deserve.",1220918400,17,1188,4.945
8198895,4,B000R57W9A,"I suppose I've always had an affection for semi-obscure films.  Even if they're just average, there's something special about seeing a movie that few can even recall.  Back before Hammer Films became famous for its horror movies, it had put out a slew of these ""B"" movies, working with American producer Robert Lippert.  The Hammer Film Noir Collector's Set 2 is a boxed set of eight such movies, representing Volumes 4 through 7 in the series (the first three are in a separate collection).

In Volume 4, there is Terror Street and Wings of Danger.  Terror Street has star Dan Duryea as an American Air Force pilot returning to London after months away, where he soon finds his wife leading a second life which will get her killed and him accused of the crime.  Wings of Danger has Zachary Scott as a different pilot dealing with health issues and getting tangled up with murder and smuggling.

The big stars in Volume 5 are John Ireland and Dane Clark.  Ireland runs a circus of sorts in The Glass Tomb, drawing people in to observe a man go without food for weeks.  When an acquaintance of theirs is killed, Ireland must balance the need to find the killer against his opportunity to make a buck.  Clark is in Paid to Kill, and the person he has paid to kill is himself in an attempt to provide for his wife as his business is on the brink of failure; when his fortunes turn around, he tries to stop the job, but the hired man has disappeared.

Volume 6 has The Black Glove and Deadly Game.  The former has a trumpeter (Alex Nicol) implicated in the murder of a singer; tracking down this killer will involve getting in the world of musical piracy.  Deadly Game has Lloyd Bridges as a vacationing music student left holding a mysterious envelope when the friend he was supposed to deliver it to has been killed.

Finally, Volume 7 has The Unholy Four, which opens with a missing-and-presumed-dead businessman reappearing after four years, and out to find the man who left him injured and with temporary amnesia.  Of course, others die and both the businessman and possibly cheating wife stand accused of the crime.  At this point, they must have run out of murder stories, because the second feature on this disc is Race for Life, a predictable auto racing movie starring Richard Conte.

None of these movies are really great, but they never aspire to be.  Averaging just over 70 minutes each, they are interesting diversions.  Several of the movies were directed by Terence Fisher who would later become Hammer's most prominent horror director, so this is a chance to view some of his early work.  I suppose that they are all three star efforts, but they do make a fun set, and with some minor extras, I am giving this collection four stars.  If you're a fan of noir, this is a good chance to expand your horizons beyond the big films.",1209254400,14,2839,4.582178217821782
