8372224,2,B002KTJR2Q,too banish. If you have an older kid with a little knowledge don't bother.,1433289600,,74,4.357142857142857
8372225,5,B002KTJR2Q,My baby has been watching these DVDs for about 4 months. Not sure if he has learned anything because he is only 12 months old but he dances to the songs. He loves it a lot as he runs to the TV as soon as the DVD is on.,1427932800,,218,3.4693877551020407
8372226,4,B002KTJR2Q,"They are well organized. I like the fact that they present the same item in different scenarios with real children. My grand daughter -3 years old, watches it over an over. Even though I am Chinese, my native dialect is Cantonese, so these DVDs help me correct my Mandarin.",1364342400,,273,4.591836734693878
8372227,4,B002KTJR2Q,"I have been showing my 1-yr old son the Baby Learn Chinese DVD 2 and 3 (food and animals) from the Blue Box collection everyday for the past 3 months. He really likes them especially the animals DVD. So I decided to buy the Green Box collection (DVD 4-6) for variations of what he could watch. I played the DVD 4 (Sports) to my son today and he didn't seem to enjoy it as much as the DVD 2/3. The song format on this DVD is different than the DVD 2/3, it has less songs, it repeats the words more often and for each sport, it shows children playing the kiddie version of the sports rather than real professional athletes. Overall, I think it is still a better chinese DVD than the rest out there and I still like it but I wish it sticks to the same format of the older DVD's (more songs and play video footage of real athletes rather than children version of the sports). I have not played DVD 5 and 6 yet.",1279929600,3,906,4.095505617977528
8372228,5,B002KTJR2Q,"Excellent quality production. The DVD's are well-designed. I love the way it has been put together. A word is presented, eg. hat, you see the word in chinese, you hear it pronounced, you see the hat used in different contexts and you hear the word repeated. When you set the subtitle on, you see the pinyin. After a list of the new words are presented this way, you get a quick review of the words used to refresh your memory. There are also chinese songs with children singing. This is no miracle system to learn chinese but it is a fun way to be exposed to the language. It is not only great for kids/toddlers/babies but also excellent for parents who have a basic grounding in chinese and would like to expand/refresh their vocabulary, not only spoken but written as well.

This green box set comes with DVD 4, 5, 6 and two packs of flash cards.

Pros:
- fun way to learn chinese
- well-designed.
- excellent quality visuals and sounds; exceeded my expectations but I did have low expectations to begin with.
- the characters are cute; not only the cartoon characters but the children used in the DVD's. My little girl enjoys watching the children on the show.
- teaches spoken chinese as well as written chinese word.
- the box set is nicely packaged.

Cons:
- flash cards don't have pictures. They have chinese words and pinyin. Would be great if there were pictures associated with the words.
- no miracle system. Miracle systems for learning a language do not exist anyway. Don't expect your children to love it. They may be hooked for 5 or 10 minutes to begin with but may tune out after that. Once they are familiar with it, they may ask for it. There is a lot of new data for them and can overload easily. Take your time with it. But it is a fun way to expose them to the language and learn a new set of vocabulary.

Conclusion:
- A highly recommended purchase!",1263600000,7,1871,4.414492753623189
