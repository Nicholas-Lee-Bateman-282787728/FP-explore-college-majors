5680025,3,B00BX8PG5M,"A bit slow moving at the start, but more action toward the end.  Was good for a relaxing evening, but probably would not feel a need to ever watch again.",1373068800,,153,4.1
5680026,2,B00BX8PG5M,"PHANTOM took me by surprise when I saw it was on DVD. I hadn't heard of the movie yet it stars one of my favorite actors, Ed Harris. The description on the DVD case made the story seem fantastically interesting. I had to see this film. It's a simple but incredible premise. Rogue agents from take over control of a Soviet submarine armed with nuclear missiles. We eventually learn what the ""Phantom"" is and its potential role in starting WW III and making the Soviets look like innocent players in the world scene. OK, sounds good but something gets totally lost in this film. The plot seems contrived and even another great performance by Ed Harris can save this film.
PHANTOM takes place almost entirely inside a real Soviet submarine that is currently in San Diego, CA. The remarkable realism is overshadowed by the dark lighting of the film. It's often hard to see faces and background in the film though I commend the filmmakers on using a real submarine and not one created on a set.

A film set in a submarine automatically creates a sensation of claustrophia for the actors and the viewers. The action only picks up near the end of the film when a crisis is approaching. I want to be vague about the plot but it certainly was not satisfying. It says something about a film when the bonus features are MUCH more interesting and informative than the movie. The opening of PHANTOM says it is ""inspired by true events"" and the bonus features explain the ""true events"", though we are still left to wonder what really happened to the submarine that ""inspired"" this movie. SO much missed potential in this film.",1372982400,4,1612,4.616724738675958
5680027,2,B00BX8PG5M,Phantom is an OK submarine movie with little suspense or drama.  The acting is fair at best even by the bigger named stars.,1372723200,,123,4.3478260869565215
5680028,4,B00BX8PG5M,"Well-written suspense thriller about a Soviet nuclear sub and its captain's power struggle with a KGB agent on board for control of the sub. Ed Harris does a great job as the captain who suffers from epilepsy and who has flashbacks about a tragedy aboard one of his ships. The suspense builds as the KGB agent (played well by David Duchovny)  gets increasingly more control of the sub and perhaps of the nuclear missile onboard. Great acting by all, good build up of tension and suspense. But, as other reviewers have said, the end is totally out of character with the film's depiction of sweaty realism---it resorted to some sort of fantasy world so that audiences can achieve some vicarious satisfaction through the families of the servicemen. (It reminded me of the ending of Edge of Darkness with Mel Gibson, where we see the father and daughter strolling out of the hospital, side by side, even though both had already died!). Besides this strange ending, everything else was excellent. I recommend it.",1372550400,,1007,4.854651162790698
5680029,5,B00BX8PG5M,"I heard David Duchovny on a talk show and he gave the premise of the movie and explained that the events in the movie, ""Phantom"" were classified factoids.
Very entertaining and Ed Harris is another actor on my ""A"" list.

David Duchovny did a fabulous portrayal of a man bent on his mission and the action was great and real.

I truly enjoyed the movie and everyone should see it.  Refreshing,as we have had to move away from the cold war movie days, and this movie is a great reminder that these possibilities were real and true.

I have a friend that was from the ""cold war era"" and he was on a sub for his 20 year career and he said that they would actually go into the Russian ports, underneath the Russian ships and because it was a nuclear sub, they were undetected and that there were times when things were lined up and all they had to do was wait for the word and WW!!! would have been a reality.",1372550400,6,904,4.208092485549133
5680030,4,B00BX8PG5M,"If you're able to look past the fact that all of the Russians are played by Americans (running from Americans) who, with the exception of William Fichtner, never remotely attempt an accent, you'll find you're in for a real treat with Phantom. A cast of recognizable--iconic even--faces come together for this quiet, smart tale of intrigue. Ed Harris is as tremendous as ever but it's David Duchovny who turns in the most unexpected performance. A very enjoyable film packed with extras that are worth watching, especially in regards to the historical truths the movie is based upon. The metaphysical ending might confuse some but the visuals throughout the film lend to the 'haunted' aspect of the film. I'd say this is more 'U-571' than 'Hunt for Red October' but if you're a submarine fan, this is an admirable entry to the genre. The fact that it was filmed entirely on board an actual Soviet sub made it even more interesting. Enjoy!",1372291200,38,937,4.826086956521739
5680031,4,B00BX8PG5M,"""There are only 2 reasons for a boat to go rogue. One is to defect and the other is to start a war and I don't think we're defecting."" This movie is based on actual evens set during the Cold War between the US and the USSR. After returning home and excited about being on leave the A Russian sub captain (Harris) and crew are stunned when they are chosen to go on another mission right away. The mission is classified and the only one on the sub that knows the details is a KGB agent Duchovny). When certain details emerge the crew starts to rethink the orders they are given. I was looking forward to seeing this for really one reason. I am a huge Ed Harris fan. He did not disappoint in this movie. The movie itself is also really good and the best way to describe it is a mix of Hunt For Red Octber and Crimson Tide. The fact that the movie is true makes it even more interesting to watch. It is a little predictable but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie at all. If you are a fan of movies like Red October then this movie is for you. I recommend this. Overall, very tense and exciting. I give it a B+.",1371945600,66,1127,4.058295964125561

It is a great flick with superb acting. Story is excellent. The ultimate in theater - all believable. Lots of sadness, deceit, excitement and suspense. The technical stuff is quite accurate. I am a submariner and can say this with some confidence.

5680062,5,B00BX8PG5M,"As a former submariner, I buy and collect all submarine-oriented movies. This one has quite an interesting narrative, and, of course, look at the two main stars? I mean, who wouldn't buy a movie with Ed Harris in it and Mr. X-Files, himself? Of course, there is only so much you can do with KGB oriented narratives, and searching for a treasure (of gold) is always pretty much the same rigamarole. But in this movie, the suspense is based on human drama, and, of course, it's one of those sensational endings I'd love to tell you how that all worked out, but you'd probably slap me for telling you ahead of time, so I won't. Suffice it to say this DVD is worth the money and the time to watch it. Down-ladder, clear the baffles and dive...DIVE!

5680082,5,B00BX8PG5M,Yeah you read right. I said 5 stars. The cover looks dull. The stars look dull. I expected a dull listless Russian sub movie. Ed Harris is superb as the burned out Soviet Diesel Sub skipper who never measured up to his legendary father. His career has basically been a total failure. A waste. Or like many of us is he selling himself short. They say forgiving ourselves is the harder than forgiving others. That's what makes this a great movie. The performance of Ed Harris. David ( The X files) Duchovny as an (EVIL) rouge KGB operative also hits the mark. And the extra's that ties this movie to an actual historic event is scary to say the least.

5680106,4,B00BX8PG5M,"Once you get past the extremely slow first 30 minutes and digest the fact that the Russians sound like they were all born and raised in the midwestern US, ""Phantom"" is a well made and engrossing character study/thriller about the advent of the cold war in the 60's.  KGB agent Duchovny leads a small cadre tasked with installing and testing a top secret cloaking device on Harris' submarine capable of disguising the sub's sonar ""signature"" to friends and foes alike.  His top secret mission is the source of continual conflict and adds to the dramatic tension.

Taking place almost entirely inside a 60's era Soviet submarine there's a claustrophobic realism that grabs and successfully diverts attention away from the fact that everyone sounds American.  Art direction, set design and cinematography are first class, and this helps overcome some rigid, unconvincing dialog (mostly from Duchovny in the beginning of the movie).  Ed Harris is magnificent as the weary submarine captain- markedly in his ability to show strength amid some serious physical and emotional flaws.  You get a very real sense that the stakes were incredibly high and the director builds tension without excessive histrionics.

The ending, though contrived and clumsy, works well on an emotional level and gives us a sense of closure.

Occasional language and violence. Strongly recommended.",1424390400,,1367,5.238532110091743

The plastic explosive went off in the launch tube sinking the sub.

5680135,3,B00BX8PG5M,"Phantom is loosely based on a historical event surrounding a real-life Soviet Navy submarine that got into trouble in the late 1960s. Ed Harris plays Demi, captain of the submarine. David Duchovny is a mysterious agent whose motive for accompanying the crew is not disclosed. But perhaps you will guess it right anyway.

Despite its quiet and slow-moving start (with a cameo of Lance Henriksen), the film gets interesting once the submarine is underwater, but it never reaches the level of intensity you might expect. The cast all did a good job, including always reliable William Fichtner, but I really didn't find the story interesting, as it was a bit predictable and familiar.

Apparently Phantom is inspired by an actual incident of the Soviet submarine K-129 in 1968. A quick research on the internet will provide you with lots of information about what happened after the event itself (with one secret mission involving Howard Hughes), which is more interesting than the films entire storyline.

Within a limited budget the filmmakers created a set of the inside of the Russian submarine where most major events take place. The set looks convincing to me though some of you may point out technical errors, which I am not particularly interested. What I didn't like very much about the film is the story that lacks the thrills of other submarine-related movies.",1391904000,,1367,5.013215859030837
5680136,5,B00BX8PG5M,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie and a bit different one. It was interesting to see so many actors who usually play All-American roles cast as Russians, with not a Soviet accent in the bunch.  Once that little hurdle was leaped (because I kept expecting it to crop up somewhere), this was different all the way. ""Based on actual events"" can mean a lot of things. Here it meant that in 1969, a Soviet sub went missing and was later discovered sunk with its nuclear torpedo missing. That's the basis for this film and the screen writer's literary extrapolation of how and why that event occurred. Maybe true or perhaps not. Either way, it's a tense, exciting story of a less-than sterling son still trying to live up to his formidable farther's military reputation while going on his last voyage before retiring. Definitely reminiscent of The Hunt for Red October with familiar faces throughout the cast.  My only complaint was the ending which traipsed without a clue from thriller into the metaphysical. The same scene shot from the family's viewpoint might've been much more touching.  Even with that it's a 5-star so view it and enjoy.",1391817600,,1142,4.816326530612245

5680138,4,B00BX8PG5M,"""Phantom"" is loosely based upon certain theories concerning the demise of Soviet submarine K219 which was lost with all hands several hundred miles from Hawaii.  In this film, Richard Harris stars as a Soviet submarine captain who is tasked to take his submarine on a cruise with secretive KGB personnel who have a secret mission.  Conflict ensues between the captain and the KGB contingent as the captain (Harris) learns of the true intent of the KGB.  More would be telling (no spoilers here).

The film is intelligently acted and is filmed aboard an actual Soviet submarine, which lends an air of authenticity to this film.  On the downside, the entire cast apparently is American and the crew and officers seem more American than Soviet.  This is, in fact, my main criticism of this otherwise very well-done film.  The people just don't come off as Russian.

5680144,3,B00BX8PG5M,"Demi, a Soviet captain past his prime, has been given command of an outdated diesel submarine.  Neither he nor his crew are particularly happy about it, nor are they excited to take on some new men, whose purposes are mysterious and whose background is questionable.  Before long, Demi begins to realize how strange things really are, and that his sub may be the last thing standing in the way of nuclear war.

PHANTOM is a decent little thriller, though it has its flaws.  The one catching the most flack is that Russian soldiers generally speak Russian in Russian accents.  But whatever.  If that's your biggest gripe about the film, then you're missing the point of fictionalized entertainment.  There are bigger issues of logic, plotting, and pace at hand; the film bogs down a bit, and then rushes towards its conclusion.  By the end, it becomes a different film altogether (which makes one think how truly good PHANTOM could've been, if had stuck with this more cerebral tone all along).

However, one major thing PHANTOM has going in its favor is the caliber of acting on hand.  Ed Harris gives a reliably solid turn, with William Fichtner matching him step for step as Demi's second-in-command and best friend.  David Duchovny gives a surprisingly good performance as the ambiguous Bruni (there are no straight up villains in this film, yet another thing going in its favor; everyone has reasons for why they do what they do).  The supporting cast is also game, particularly Johnathon Shcaech as a confused political officer, and the great Lance Henriksen in a brief but memorable role.  The acting carries this film; the final few scenes, as well as brief scenes throughout the film, make you wonder how good PHANTOM could've been; but overall, if you're looking for something to kill an hour and a half, you could do far worse.",1385251200,,1837,4.830670926517572

5680151,2,B00BX8PG5M,"I bought this DVD on the basis of previous reviews and whilst I did 'somewhat' enjoy watching it, I felt that it was by no means the ""absolute thriller"" and ""awesome cold war"" movie that such reports portrayed. David Dushovny's first appearance was simply embarassing (due mainly to his appalling attempt to speak with a Russian accent)and his acting was very VERY wooden - HOWEVER - to his credit his acting slowly grew on you and towards the end he did finally portray a reasonably good (SPOILER......) evil man - not his best work that I've seen (2.5/10)

The fact that all the Russian's were portayed by American actors, who constantly spoke with American idioms (ie saying the word ""crewmate"" instead of ""comrade"" which is a Russian verb at its purest) detracted from this movie and indicated the glaring inadequacies liberally sprinkled throught this film. This film could have been an excellent 5 star movie indeed; it portrayed a little known cold war atomic (not nucular) 'missadventure' that could have nastly blown out to cause WW3 - on an atomic scale (parden the pun). With such an interesting topic to create a film around its a pity that not enough was done to develop more authentic aspects to carry the film just that much further in the enjoyment factor. Ed Harris (8/10)- well I can't remember a bad film he has ever done and in PHANTOM he quite literally carries the whole move on his shoulders (if Ed was missing I shudder to think of how bad this film would have actually been).

PHANTOM is a somewhat enjoyable film; the actors make it worthwhile watching and its one easily watched, but so much the better if you know/understand the context of the time(s) and socio-political background when this 'incident' occured as it helps to brush over the short-comings of the film.

I was also a little confused on the whole Americans playing Russians thing, but I let that go pretty quickly.

5680158,4,B00BX8PG5M,"I am a massive Ed Harris fan so wanted to see this just beacuse he is in it. It is `based' on actual events that took place during The Cold War, when the nuclear stand off between America and Russia had us on the edges of our seats a few times and saw the emergence of CND, (now sadly reduced to a fashion logo). Ed Harris plays Demi the Captain of a diesel powered submarine with nuclear capability. He and his crew have just finished a lengthy mission when he is ordered back to sea.

Demi has been suffering seizures from an earlier incident which left him with a head injury. His judgement is sometimes impaired and in good old naval tradition he uses rum to sort out the whole problem. As was the case in those days everyone has a political officer on board and his is actually a friend, however they are also accompanied by some very zealous KGB types who are going to test a top secret new weapon. The KGB are led by Bruni played by David `X-Files' Duchovny. It soon becomes apparent that the KGB are not all they seem to be and might just be going rogue, but as Harris and his men discuss; you only go rogue for two reasons, one is to defect and the other is to start a war; no one thinks these uber Communista types are about to start working for Uncle Sam, and so the scene is set for a rather good thriller.

Now there are a few issues with this film that may turn some people off, for starters they are all supposed to be Russian and yet all speak with their normal accents which I know is fine but I would have liked a veiled attempt to at least pretend to pronounce all your `R's backwards etc or put in `ski' after a few things- still never mind. Then some of the scenes are a bit modern the port is so not 1968, they would have referred to each other as `comrade' and not `sir' etc. There is a full list for real anoraks on IMDB in case you are bothered.

All of that said I still really enjoyed it, it was suspenseful, it was tense and there were some very good performances, Harris and Duchovny were brilliant as was one of my favourites Lance Henriksen as Markov who you may remember from `Millennium' or as the robot in `Aliens' or indeed `Aliens vs. Predators'. The production is generally impressive and everyone puts in solid performances and the time just flew by. So for some Cold War retro thrills you could do a lot worse than to check this out.",1379808000,,2372,4.220264317180617
5680159,2,B00BX8PG5M,"Considering it deals with the possible annihilation of all life on the planet, you'd think ""Phantom,"" written and directed by Todd Robinson, would be a more interesting and compelling film than it turns out to be. Instead, it's an anachronistic Cold War tale that couldn't feel more remote and irrelevant to the world of today. And it doesn't help one bit that the story is based on some actual events that occurred in 1968.

Ed Harris plays a veteran submarine captain for the Russian navy who's sent on a mysterious mission with some possibly rogue elite KGB agents on board. What they're up to is anyone's guess, but could it have something to do with wresting control of the ship's nuclear missile from the captain and the crew?

Even if you can get past the rather disconcerting spectacle of a cast of all-American actors portraying unaccented Russians, you're still left with having to wade through a muddled story, the logistics of which are so arcane and esoteric that we often can't figure out what's going on (we just know by the actors' grim demeanor that it is all Very Very Serious).

And just as you're about to give the movie credit for at least daring to show things from the other side of the Cold War, Harris delivers a speech so absurdly complimentary of the Americans that Thomas Paine himself could have written it. And just as you're about to congratulate it for not going for the obligatory deep dive/popping rivet scene, down we go to the bottom (in  more ways than one), as it all culminates in a scene that is so embarrassing it has to be seen to be believed.

Harris does yeoman work in service to the cause, though David Duchovny is a bit stiff as a psychotic KGB operative. But even the finest of performances wouldn't be enough to keep us from nodding off as the world stands on the brink of thermonuclear self-destruction.

It's probably safe to say that ""Das Boot"" has spoiled us for all subsequent submarinar dramas, but ""Phantom"" barely even tries.",1379548800,,1982,4.664756446991404

Ed Harris has never put in a bad performance in his life; but the rest of the cast rises to the challenge here. This is drama and not a action flick really so VIDEO GAME IDIOTS WHO WANT constant action should avoid it probably.  Instead it is a tight drama based loosely on the story of the k-129. That sub did in fact go rogue and was taken over by the kgb. The crew sabotaged the nuke missle and it blew up and killed them all.  The kgb was trying to fire it on Hawaii. ANd they were trying to convince the americans that it was china doing it. That is very similar to this movie. I do believe the k129 deserves a monument for what they did too. This flick is great while it's in the sub as it's a real sub and that makes it more realistic.  the ending is more metaphysical or spiritual , but I didn't care as this was a good drama. And it made me think about the k-129 and what they did for all of us.  David ducoveny is outstanding in this too as the kgb rogue agent.  He gets more fanatical as the film moves on.  The computer generated effects are average here and would have been top notch 15 years ago, but you can forgive them that because they just had such a small budget. In fact models would have looked more realistic but that would have cost a lot more. So forgive them that and just enjoy the excellent acting.  And William fictner really helps this flick out too. He's another actor that never has given a bad performance. So that helps in this movie too.

5680170,4,B00BX8PG5M,"The acting pulls off the story.  To me, a USN Submariner from the 60s (when the event-basis of the movie's story actually took place), there was ample room to ignore the fact that the pier-tied Soviet Foxtrot museum boat at San Diego was the boat used for the background.  The action was good and the story line carried the day, making it easier to overlook that it was a fictionalize version of events from 1968.  Ed Harris and company did an outstanding job.  By the way, the sub used for the filming is a Foxtrot Class (Nato term) while the Soviet sub involved in the actual events was a Golf Class (also Nato name).

5680206,4,B00BX8PG5M,"***PLOT SPOILER REVIEW***

As a former submariner who rode these old vessels I found this film fascinating. One story was that the US sunk this ship. This movie presents a different version.

The story is simple. The KGB goes rogue with a submarine with the intent of launching a first strike at the US, making it look like China did it. The film creates characters and internal conflicts to make the story interesting.

Kudos to the film for getting the submarine terminology and capability correct. This aspect was more realistic than most sub films.

There are some problems with the basic scenario. First off in 1968, China had only one Golf style submarine operational. It did NOT have launch capabilities. They wouldn't develop that until 1970. The second problem is that nuclear bombs have signature. We could figure out the difference between a crude Chinese graphite reactor bomb and a slightly more sophisticated Russian bomb. So the premise of the film while interesting, doesn't seem plausible.

Another film goof was when they encountered the USS Skipjack. The Skipjack was stationed out of Norfolk and operated in that area in 1968. The submarine in the Pacific was the USS Swordfish, i.e. a Skipjack class sub, but not the Skipjack itself.

The actors did what they could with a dry script. Landlubbers may find this film a complete bore and rightly so. We already know they fail. Extras include a talk about the real incident on which the film was based.

5680207,3,B00BX8PG5M,"*** Warning this review contains minor spoilers

I have several problems with this movie. The first is I am used to being with Russians, and these people did not act like Russians. More importantly like officers in the Russian navy during the communist era. I doubt American officers would behave like these guys do much less Communist era officers.

Nor did the submarine look like a USSR submarine of the period. I know I have been in one. Clearly it was not well researched the movie.

As the plot developed, the almost guilt-ridden  captain story became more implausible. Okay the captain was responsible for a minor naval disaster which killed about eight people, but life goes on. I can remember reading of an Israeli tank commander who made a bad mistake, and a man in his group died by accident. He did not go overboard like this captain, and he was in a society which is super sensitive on this sort of stuff. Hardly, something the old USSR military or society was. I used to work in a plant that had an industrial death every few months, and I can assure you industrial and military accidents happen all the time; you get used to them.

Having said that the story is reasonable for a movie, it is not all that original. Unfortunately, I just did not get that absorbed in the story.

Having said that the acting is good, the filming is good.

It is a fascinating story based on some true and to this date unexplained events during the height of the Cold War.

The one complaint that my crew had was that everyone spoke English, no one tried to do a bad Russian accent.  Um, OK.  I have mixed feelings about this.  If you had real Russian linguist experts that could throw in some vintage lingua to help suspend disbelief then OK, maybe a good idea.  If it would sound like a crappy attempt at bad Russian then I prefer the route they took.

** Spoilers Follow **

Harris' and Fichtner's characters find out before they leave the harbor that half of their crew are KGB fanatics.

Duchovny's character is just looking for an excuse to relieve the Captain and take over the vessel.  Eventually the KGB does take over the vessel, but they do not have enough folks to run the vessel so a few loyal crew are left.

The plan is to launch a nuke at the United States Pacific Fleet from within Chinese territorial waters and cause a nuclear exchange between the PRC and the USA.  The title of the movie comes from a KGB device that allows the sub to appear as other vessels, a Chinese vessel in this case.

The crew fights back, and ...

The nuclear war is prevented, but the only survivor is the XO, who we see at the end visiting the sub as it is hauled in with the remains to dry dock.  (I added this line to the review because it was a little unclear.  We had to re-watch that part of the movie a few times before we understood what happened.)

Officers engaged in a frolicking party with women, wearing church crosses over their necks (in1968!), exchanging marital wows at church, wearing expensive rings on their left hands (it should be on right one, just a plain gold band and probably not worn at all when in service).. Not a single one from the crew with a Russian-looking face, all speaking in English, of course... A captain who was not decommissioned because of prior seizures, apparently a rogue plan with rogue KGB agents... Despite the commentary in special features, the offered plot seems far, far from reality. Not even loosely based on real events, as conceded in the end of the movie as remaining classified by both governments. The only ""loose"" fact was that there was a USSR boat lost there (followed by the Project Azorian). But if you don't expect any authenticity factor at all, and just watch it as thriller, then the acting and twist are  good, but not great.
