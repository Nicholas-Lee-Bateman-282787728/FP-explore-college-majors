7878996,3,630489872X,"I'm too young to remember this show when it originally aired in the mid 1960's. I came to it mainly out of interest in Air Programs International (API) the Australian production company that created the cartoon, but then later went on to make a number of animated TV specials throughout the 70's.

This show bears little relationship to their later work, but it is certainly entertaining enough, and is close indeed to Rocky and Bullwinkle. The animation and the quirky humor will remind you of that show--except that it is set in Camelot. It's more like the ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" segment of Bullwinkle. Very absurd--almost Dada.

It's not bad--a bit derivative, but not bad.",1098144000,,677,4.9298245614035086
7878997,5,630489872X,"I saw this video ages and ages ago, and have been desperately searching for it ever since! It is without a doubt the funniest spoof I have ever seen in my entire life, in the tradition of Rocky and Bullwinkle!
It is a  seriously skewed version of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  It includes such comic jewels as Guinevere trying to keep people from  leaving her ball too early, Morgana le Fay tricking Lancelot into becoming  her boyfriend, Merlin taking a bath in one of his potions, and other  things!
Perfectly safe to leave your kids watching this, they'll guffaw  at the gags and so will you!",952128000,7,614,4.486486486486487
