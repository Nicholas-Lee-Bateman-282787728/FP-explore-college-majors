8270826,5,B000E4W57S,"Utah is good copy at 77 minutes, but short of 80 minutes by Alpha video.  King of the Cowboys is as good as any on the market - listed as best on my list.  The Lights of Old Santa Fe at 78 minutes is best on my list also.  Sunset Serenade also get next to top billing (Cumberland - Hollywood Attic is best at 59 minutes). This one is 58 minutes and includes all of the songs as I recall.  The Cowboy and the Senorita is the 53 minute cut version.  But this tape is one to be included in a good Roy Rogers collection.  Diamond vhs tapes were good quality for the most part.",1398902400,,572,3.9304347826086956
