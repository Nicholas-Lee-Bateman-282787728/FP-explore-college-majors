A manipulative twerp named Cliff (Martin Donovan) and his beautiful wife Abbey (Julia Anderson) have a massive car accident which leaves the wife severely burned from head to toe and in a coma. Cliff, with the advice of his conniving lawyer Ira (Corbin Bornsen), decides he would like to pull the plug on her and set in motion a law suit that will result in millions of dollars be given to her beneficiary. The victim's mother is adamant that her daughter be kept alive and sets up petitions. What develops is a tale of vengeance as the victimized woman's ghost leaves her body whenever she ""flat lines"", and takes revenge on those who have scorned her. Her spirit is transported back in to her body once she is artificially resuscitated and waits to seek revenge once again the minute her heart stops beating.

Directed by Rob Schmidt (""Wrong Turn""), ""Right to Die"" has got to be one of the most stomach churning episodes I have seen to date (I have yet to finish watching all of Season 2). The gore is excruciatingly explicit and the subject matter disturbing. The body count is not as high as one might expect but there is enough blood and burnt flesh on display to keep those gore-hounds in check and those not expecting such graphic scenes of human suffering, will be pleasantly surprised. The main reasons this episode got to me was because it displays two aspects of human anguish that really irk me. The director did not shy away from exploiting these scenes of torment and showcases them in all of their gory glory in gooey explicit detail. The make-up effects are well done as is the gore effects and the performances are up to standard particularly Donovan. Those who are expecting a sub standard entry from this particular director (since he hasn't really made a horror film worthy of praise although I did enjoy ""Wrong Turn"") may be surprised as this entry far exceeds many others in the series in sheer entertainment and ferocity. Even those directed by more respected genre directors come up short in comparison. ""Right to Die"" definitely requires you to suspend disbelief, even the scenes that do not involve the resentful ghost wreaking havoc amongst the living but this is a horror tale so suspend your disbelief already and just sit back and enjoy the scenery as sick and perverse as the scenery is. Yuck and totally recommended.",1258070400,,2367,4.742718446601942
2788320,3,B000NY0YJA,"Rob Schmidt is far from being a Master of Horror, but the Wrong Turn director manages to turn in a decent enough Masters of Horror episode with Right to Die.  Martin Donovan (The Quiet, Insomnia) stars as a cheating dentist, whose wife (Julia Anderson) is involved in a catastrophic car crash that leaves her with severe burns and in a coma.  While he insists on the plug being pulled, her mother fights to keep her alive, which results in the wife's spirit taking vengeance on whoever she can get her hands on.  Despite the leaps in logic and cavalcade of plot holes, Right to Die is a pretty decent episode of the horror anthology series, most notably thanks to Martin Donovan's manic performance and the superb gore effects work from KNB.  Other than that though, there really isn't anything much else to admire about Right to Die.  Considering the storyline, you'd figure that writer John Esposito would easily go for the political satire route, buthe doesn't, which leaves Right to Die kind of empty.  Flaws aside though, Right to Die does manage to deliver the goods that horror fans look for, and in that respect alone, Right to Die works.",1205020800,,1146,4.705
2788321,5,B000NY0YJA,"This was my favorite episode.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  I love revenge stories and this was no exception.  She wasn't the nicest person, however burns have got to be the most painful, debilitating injury of all and that guy deserved his comeuppance !!",1197504000,,262,4.416666666666667
2788322,4,B000NY0YJA,"*contains spoilers*
the first 20 minutes are very slow, after that it picks up and becomes an engaging drama. at first i thought the twist at the end, which is actually a reveal of something that happened at the start, was dumb, but five minutes later what it actually meant hit me (that he wants to keep his wife alive so her ghost can't come after him) and now i think it's genius. i generally dislike twist endings because they contradict the previous story but this one does the exact opposite.",1196899200,,498,4.483516483516484
2788323,1,B000NY0YJA,"So many plotholes I dare not go into them here. This being 1 hour in length there were so many scenes that raised questions which were never answered. While Corbin Bernson stole the scenes by nailing down his seedy lawyer character in the first half hour, the film then falls apart as it abruptly tries to become horrific but so many unecesary scenes are added from out of nowhere with no resolution. It seems as though this was meant to have been at least 100 minutes, but scenes were deleted resulting in a film which could have been decent, but instead turns out to be a waste of time.",1194739200,,588,4.4036697247706424
2788324,3,B000NY0YJA,"This installment of Masters of Horror was pretty good but not great.  I have to say the story was pretty interesting and slightly creepy at times.  I would say it is definately worth checking out, but not worth buying.",1184630400,,218,4.564102564102564
2788325,1,B000NY0YJA,"For anyone who appreciates a film possessing even a MINUTE amount of good story-telling, adequate research into the subjects discussed, a believable plot, adequate acting skills, etc. then my advice is to AVOID THIS TURKEY LIKE THE PLAGUE!  This film is SOOO BAD in ALL aspects that it actually makes ANYTHING that was done by the late Ed Wood look like a MASTERPIECE by comparison!

For starters, the storyline is so POORLY WRITTEN, the scenarios presented here SO IMPROBABLE, that even folks who would rent a film just to enjoy a little T&A(which is the ONLY THING this piece of doggie-doo has to offer) will likely scratch their head in utter confusion as to WHAT THE HELL is going on here!
Men:WHEN was the last time you saw a BEAUTIFUL woman (who was also RICH) marry a guy who was:
1.ugly
2.stupid
3.boring
and actually CHOOSE TO STAY MARRIED to the loser when he was clearly
1.a pathological killer
2.a pathological liar
3.a brazen womanizer
Yup, me neither!

Second, the hospital scenarios are BEYOND fantasy, BEYOND belief!  WHERE did you EVER see a hospital where:
1. burn victims receive surgical removal of necrotic tissue in a NON-STERILE room(where apparently ANYONE CAN ENTER DURING THE PROCEDURE no less)
2. nursing staff leave open, draining wounds UNCOVERED
3. ANYONE can enter and have DIRECT contact with a DYING patient (WITHOUT direct supervision/permission of nursing staff OR family members no less!)
4. ANYONE can HIDE in an unstaffed MRI room (for a PROLONGED period no less!)

But the ridiculous reaches a CRESCENDO during a truly REPULSIVE scene where the ""good doctor"" (played by MARTIN DONOVAN, who surely needs a BETTER AGENT if he accepted a role like THIS..can you spell CAREER SUICIDE)ties up his naked young dental assistant/mistress and with her AWAKE(only receiving DENTAL anesthesia)proceeds to FLAY HER ALIVE AND NOT SO MUCH AS DRAW AN 'Ouch' from her...the poor girl even manages to COHERENTLY CHAT AWAY to him as if she's having her nails done(Say WHAT?!)

Truly, THIS episode of the series ""Masters of Horror"" will leave EVERYONE who views it asking the question:WHAT is it that actually QUALIFIES someone as a ""Master"" of Horror?  As a person who truly savors GOOD horror films and makes a point to REMEMBER the names of
TALENTED/NOTED directors and writers of such, NO WHERE OTHER than in THIS turkey of a film have I seen the names of ROB SCHMIDT(Oh WAIT! I REMEMBER now! That OTHER ""masterpiece"" he directed:""Wrong Turn""!)and JOHN ESPOSITO(writer).  Complete with all around WOODEN performances (CORBIN BERNSEN in particular turns in a performance that is truely DOA)""Masters of Horror"" this ISN'T!",1184025600,8,2644,5.006833712984054
2788326,4,B000NY0YJA,"""Right To Die"" is an interesting and entertaining episode. Directed by Rob Schmidt, who is responsible for the suprisingly good horror movie ""Wrong Turn"", proves here he does have some skill. The episode doesn't try to deliver any major gore or scary suspense, but it does make you think about if someone is in a vegetative state or permanent coma, who decides if they have the right to die?

What saves this episode from being boring is the great acting from every character in the movie and the mystery that builds up towards the second half of the story about who is actually going to live and who is actually going to die.",1179446400,4,626,4.539823008849558

8182320,4,B000NY0YJA,"More than anything, this movie remined me of 1975's ""Psychic Killer"". Cliff mortally wounds his beautiful but no-nonsense wife Abby after she threatens to divorce him for having an affair, then while she lies mute and dying in a hospital from her burns, she causes her victims to have nightmares and hallucinations until she finally gets her revenge. Overall I give this movie 4 stars, mostly for the plot and suspense... not so much for the less-than-realistic makeup and special effects.",1483747200,,489,5.049382716049383
8182321,4,B000NY0YJA,Loved the chilling idea of this movie.  The production was just a notch below perfect but the acting pushed the plot forward thrillingly.,1367625600,,137,4.956521739130435

8182323,5,B000NY0YJA,"Right to Die is arguably one of the best episodes from the Master of Horror series, sold separately by Amazon as a single movie, that argues for the right to die or euthanasia, begging the question anti-euthanasia advocates fail to consider - the right to live at what cost?

The story revolves around a married couples' argument during a trip, where distracted, the man driving the car losses control of the vehicle and the car overturns and catches on fire, with his wife being badly burnt and suffering from third degree burns and is, subsequently, put on life support in a hospital, where her state is vegetative; and the husband, under the encouragement of his lawyer to terminate life support, and, in so doing, inherit a million dollars in life insurance, decides to do so, given the fact that he marriage was already shaky after his wife discovered his affair with his dental assistant - and, after the assistant seduces him again after their break-up, much to the chagrin of his semiconscious wife, who, every time she is declared clinically dead, manages to exact revenge on all who have wronged her, and upon this discovery, by her husband, finds him seeking to skin the dental assistant and have her skin grafted onto his wife in a bid to keep her alive.

The theme of this movie really begs the question the right to live at what expense? And will have euthanasia advocates rejoicing.",1356134400,,1397,4.744855967078189
8182324,5,B000NY0YJA,"I AM A TRUE Horror movie collector. I have one of the greatest collections of VHS and dvd. I always enjoy watching Masters of Horror and this one Right to Die was a ""on the edge of the seat"" wonder what was next. I have been watching TV all my life.  It is my hobby. I can tell mostly what will happen next except for this one and there was one other movie
'Evil Dead' with Bruce Campbell. It most have made good because they made 2 sequels! Well back to Right to Die. The fx was some of the best out of this series. They did over do the sex scenes. I always say that if you can make a show that's a horror show and the writers know what they are doing you don't need sex. This was one of them They really could have added more,as I call it, sneak up scare back and forth, that's where you know it's going to happen because of the music, the slow pace and then nothing and then get ready to move on and wam! that is what does the job. Evil Dead was well known for that.
I liked the actors in Right to Die. But why did you guys stop making them? Or am I not paying attention. Well this is a 5 star and the skin donor scene was a blast!",1345161600,,1134,3.8461538461538463
8182325,5,B000NY0YJA,"She's the only reason (and that's reason enough) to watch this episode. Simply for the bathtub scene. Wow!

Honestly Episode is fairly good aside from her incredible performance. Other reviewers are missing something here.",1302566400,17,222,5.529411764705882
8182326,4,B000NY0YJA,"first, to appreciate this film, you need to be a horror fan...

that being said, this tight 60 minute film (episode) involves a couple.  The wife has just learned that hubby is having an affair.  They argue about this in the car, and hubby gets distracted and runs the car off the road.  He survives mostly without a scratch; however, she is badly burned as the car explodes into a fireball (I could insert a spoiler here, but won't).  Afterwards, the wife lays bed-ridden and in need of a skin transplant within 12 hours or she'll die.

Without describing any more of the plot......the story is essentially a revenge tale about the dangers of adultery.  There is a ""right to die"" issue, but this is just a sub-text to the larger theme of revenge.

There are some interesting super-natural elements in the film as well, and yes, lots of blood.  Martin Donovan, Julia Benson, and Robin Sydney are just perfect in their roles, and Corbin Berson is very funny.

Well done...",1270598400,,971,4.625730994152047
