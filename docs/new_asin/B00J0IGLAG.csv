If you find any redeeming qualities in this movie you are blessed with a great imagination and sense of humor! Thanks, Selecto",1438992000,,299,4.769230769230769

Another attempt from the libTARDED left to defame Christians

The movie should have been titled 'Praise Allah'!!! or 'Pastors All Over the World Are Evil Killers!!!'

'LibTURDS are Clueless Haters'

'Forget Islam the Religion of Hate and REAL Murder Let's Go After Christians'

What if the 'Bible Belt' slasher was black??

What if the 'Bible Belt' slasher worked at CNN or was an atheist or satanist??

6308261,3,B00J0IGLAG,I really couldn't take the slasher tossing to his victims verses of the bible.  I do get that he was a priest of some kind.,1435276800,,123,3.92
6308262,2,B00J0IGLAG,"The film has a couple of things that demand respect, the full on use of practical gore effects and blood without pulling away from the death scene is commendable-and it works. There is a lot of splatterfest happening in The Bible Belt Slasher II that will please any fan of low budget / homegrown/ SOV horror fans. Plus the cast and Bradley Creanzo seem to be on the same page as far as vision and passion for making this movie happen. The things that most horror fans will hate about this one, like the silly one-liners and hilarious character portrayals, are the things that I found entertaining. A few scenes are worthy of a good laugh, sometimes intended, sometimes not.

Overall, The Bible Belt Slasher II: The Holy Terror is not gonna go over well, but for many this is gonna be one of those bad movies that make its way to cult status. Oh and it happens during the Christmas holiday season so that is a nice additive.  The music and soundtrack is the other element of this movie that works. The music screams 80s hard rock which pulled me back to my youth, and the instrumental is classic slasher/giallo sweetness that creates both the mood and atmosphere needed to put this thing in retro status. The Bible Belt Slasher II is a cheap, fun, slasher that really can be entertaining if you don't take it serious.",1431216000,,1317,4.529411764705882
6308263,3,B00J0IGLAG,"The Bible Belt Slasher: The Holy Terror was a nice homage to slasher films of the eighties.

6308264,5,B00J0IGLAG,"I recommend this film to any independent horror film enthusiast.  The film is a nostalgic piece that is similar to the Halloween film. The relationship between Dr. Sam Loomis and Michael Myers mirrors Dr. Ray Landers and Jason Fry.  Jason Fry is a mental patient, who was a former priest, and continues to kill sinners.

The excellent portions of the film are the cinematography, story line, original score, and special effects.

Extras include the Bible Belt Slasher short film, the music video, and behind the scenes.

Again, this is a very fun film that took 2 years to develop and highly recommended!",1395705600,,604,4.882352941176471
6308265,5,B00J0IGLAG,"This movie has everything! Plenty of gore, action and dark comedy. This is a wonderful throwback to those late night 1980's horror classics like ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Shocker"" and the direct to video cult classic ""Video Violence"". The director did a great job with the subject matter and used the 80's atmosphere to the fullest.

The entire cast did a really good job, but my favorite actors in this by far are Bradley Creanzo, Taylor Raftree and Larry Baumer. Creanzo's character of Dr. Landers shines with influences of Donald Pleasence from the Halloween series. Mr. Creanzo is an accomplished actor and I think this film shows him in one of his finest performances to date. If anyone deserves to win an independent film award for best actor it's him! Ms. Raftree did a really good job with her character of Rebecca, and the biggest show stopper was Larry Baumer. He takes the character of Fry to the next level of insanity! He's very much like Freddy Kruger with his one liners and brutal killing techniques.

Although this is a slasher movie I like the fact that the story is somewhat different than the average slasher. Having Jason Fry as a bible toting messenger of god bringing justice to those he believes to be sinners is a nice touch. He leaves bible pages on dead bodies as his calling card, which I think is totally awesome! You can tell that the cast and crew put their hearts into this flick.

The music is also especially good in this film. It's very reminiscent of John Carpenter and the vocal songs like ""Demons of the NIght"" and ""Enemies"" just take your breath away and make you want to start dancing. This movie takes place in 1989, and you can sure feel the authenticity. I also think it was a good move on the part of the company to include the first ""Bible Belt Slasher"" as a bonus on the DVD as well as a music video for ""Demons of the Night"" by musical sensation Midnight Flashback fronted by the films director and main actor Bradley Creanzo.

If your looking for a 1980's cult horror classic then look no further than here. Two thumbs way up!",1395705600,,2081,4.571045576407506
8647113,1,B00J0IGLAG,"This movie is awful, I couldn't even make it past the first 30 minutes",1500595200,,70,4.071428571428571
8647114,5,B00J0IGLAG,"The Bible Belt Slasher: The Holy Terror is a really awesome horror/mockery!  When the movie begins we see a murderer by the name of Jason Fry awaiting his final verdict in a courtroom.  Meanwhile the family of his victims (all teenage girls and boys) sit in the back and watch.  One teen, Rebecca, is the most vocal of the group.  I guess she's the main character in the movie besides the killer.  She really wants to see this guy suffer.  Later on Jason escapes from a sanitarium after killing a doctor.  The doctor had his back turned wondering what the cast of M.A.S.H will look like in the year 2000, lol.

Oh yeah, this movie takes place in December of 1989.  The actors all have big hairstyles, and the soundtrack often sounds like a nice imitation or perhaps it's a mockery of the 80's.  Lots of special care and attention was given to making the movie resemble the late 80's.  Of course I could complain and say the music we hear is more appropriate of the *early* 80's with the synths and new wave style, but I won't!  Some of the 80's song imitations are a bit strange though.  One song that repeats the word ""Enemies"" in the chorus is a bit repetitive and drags.  It sounds like the 80's but you can tell it's not actually an 80's song given the way it's sung.  And how about the song ""Demons of the Night"" by the band Secrets In the Dark?  Is that the ultimate 80's mockery title or what?  LOL!  I bet Pat Benatar and Dio would share a good laugh over that song and band name!  It basically borrows half of Pat Benatar and Dio's lyrical content!  Later on in a bar scene we hear a country song that definitely doesn't sound like 80's music (country or rock) haha.  I enjoy it though.

Anyway Jason's surely the devil himself!  What he does is go around killing people.  Immediately after he rips pages from the Bible and places them near the dead bodies while saying some of the most *hilarious and obnoxious* comments you've ever heard!  When he drowns one girl in a fish tank he asks if she's into watersports then flaps her deceased arm up and down, lol.  He then walks into another room and kills the girls friend by first punching her repeatedly then throwing her from an upstairs bedroom window.  She lands on three fence boards outside that viciously go through her chest.  Up and Adam!  He then mocks her.  ""Up in the sky.  It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... a dead b"".  ""Hope you enjoyed your steak dinner.  Here's an after dinner mint!"" *tosses Bible page down at her*

Before he kills a Jehovah Witness he says he admires the craftsmanship of his work.  I wasn't expecting him to say that!  ""Thought you could out-Bible me with your false prophet!"" he yells.  It's funny how he gingerly lifts the guy's head on the ground while cutting his throat.  The guy laying there almost acts like he enjoys it!  Watch his face!  When Jason cuts the arm off a cop he yells ""There goes the long arm of the law!""  Boy the way this cop dies is REALLY graphic and disturbing.  He realistically screams in pain as Jason continues cutting his arm with an electric saw until he loses enough blood.  Then he passes out.  Jason keeps cutting until his arm is all the way off, hence the super hilarious ""Long arm of the law"" comment!

Jason makes another hilarious comment when looking for objects to continue his killing spree.  He picks up toilet parts and says ""What am I doing, fixing her toilet?"" and with the caulk gun ""Meh, did this one before!""  He also strangles a man who beat up Santa Claus at a bar and comes home to a wife who left him.  Jason calls the man white trash while laughing and strangling him.  ""That's all folks!""  He also mocks the letter that the guy's now ex-wife wrote and left on a table that says ""The C-word that cared"" at the end.  ""You better hope God cares now boy!""

The doctor who goes around town trying to track down Jason is a *really* poor actor.  Almost like he's intentionally poor as a way to mock the horror movie genre.  It really feels that way to me.  He exaggerates like he's a superhero or something.  The way he acts around that cop in one scene had me in stitches!  And oh, about that cop. He was looking at girly magazines and touching himself/smiling.  He didn't like the doctor walking in and interrupting him that's for sure!  Another scene that had me in stitches.  The mailman who goes to put an Ed McMahon sweepstakes envelope in somebody's mailbox.  He suddenly explodes in anger with F words saying it's all a bunch of fake crap and proceeds to rip up the envelope!  LOL!

The movie has some unusual moments too.  I didn't quite understand the scene with the angry man entering a movie rental store and causing problems with the lady behind the counter. She said he needs a membership card in order to check out videos, but he gets angry and thinks the place has a bad selection since there's no porn available.  How about the scene where Rebecca and her friend are watching MTV (even singing ""I want my MTV!""- great flashback there!)  She either dreams or pictures that she's on stage and part of the group singing that ""Demons of the Night"" song, with other characters in the movie joining in such as that doctor chasing down Jason.  He's the lead singer, and shortly after we see another woman walk in and sing another line.  It's VERY weird to me.

Also the girl who jumps behind the counter of a diner as Jason walks in.  She's almost attacked when the cops come in and disrupt it.  She's relieved she's saved.  I think she's the same girl who was thrown from the bedroom window.  Was she dreaming this?  That repetitive 2-note guitar line we hear in the beginning while we see the graveyard from many different angles for a few minutes... it's a great song and captures the 80's very well!  The story never explains why Jason is so obsessed with the Bible, or rather, obsessed using the Bible to fuel his desire to kill innocent people.  Overall recommend for the laughs and obnoxious ways of Jason!",1500508800,,5968,4.431336405529954

8647118,4,B00J0IGLAG,"I apologize. I liked this ""bad"" film more than my peers.

This film is a cheaply made slasher. It is a ""part 2"" although I doubt if anyone had seen the 30 minute short, part one. In that feature, preacher Jason Fry (Larry Baumer) kills a bunch of kids making crank phone calls. In this feature it has moved from 1988 to December 1989. Fry is convicted of murder and goes to the Hillside Asylum which looks like it is in a strip mall with a sign taped to the window. Fry escapes by killing his doctor with a candy cane and then goes after the parents (and sister) of those pranksters that he killed.

The acting was bad and at times funny it was so bad. The film was supposed to be taking place in Wilkens, Tennessee, but was clearly filmed in the town of Linden, New Jersey. They went out of their way NOT to cover it up...New Jersey license plates, Linden jackets, and Nick's Family restaurant. Plus the fact no one had a southern accent. One scene takes place in a Yankees bar with a Mattingly ""Hit Man"" poster and a picture of Thurman Munson. The bar also had a Russian flag, later we see a German flag in a home. I am still trying to figure that out. Then there was the Burt Cummings joke. Of course how many people know Burt Cummings was part of ""The Guess Who"" and was a porn addict. So when the guy tries to rent porn and tells the lady to put it on Burt Cummings tab, and Burt will be angry if he doesn't get his porn...who got that reference? There were things within the film I am sure the naysayers missed, but which I appreciate.

Now the killer, a ""victim of this evil society"" was full of bad puns and bad humor, yet he spouted out lines in Freddy fashion, although nowhere near as good. While they ignored the fact we could see the plates, they did pay attention to the era and especially the electronics of that age, turning them and MTV into a joke, tossing in a Bollywwod song and dance in the middle of the feature, MTV fantasy style.

Fry's Bible is his ""precious"" as he rips out a page for each victim and places it on them.

The movie is not for everyone. For bad film lovers who look for dumb details and obscure references, this one has them.
