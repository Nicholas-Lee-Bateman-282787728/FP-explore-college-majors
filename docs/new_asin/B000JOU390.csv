BODY STORY: CRASH

The human body is an intricate machine, perfectly balanced and capable of growth, self maintenance, and rejuvenation.  This episode of Body Story illustrates what happens when catastrophe strikes, and how the body copes to protect itself and embark on the healing process.

David and Laura experience a devastating car accident.  Although both receive medical attention, their bodies' mechanisms will play the pivotal role in determining recovery.  Stunning 3-D animation takes you through David and Laura's damaged bodies as they stave off further injury and begin life-saving processes.

As David lies comatose, his brain stem maintains bodily functions while his cerebral cortex begins complex repairs.  When he awakens with memory loss, his body helps him by establishing new neural connections,  Meanwhile, as Laura deals with a husband who cannot remember her, she is unknowingly undergoing her own battle for survival.  Her damaged spleen attempts self-repair, but by ignoring the warning signs of pain, Laura brings herself to the brink of disaster.",1289174400,,1326,5.482758620689655
