I remember when my father was in a very similar hospital to the British hospital featured in the film in the late 1960s. I used to nurse, but did my training at the then Westminster Hospital which was an elite teaching hospital in the centre of London, now moved to Chelsea &  called the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital. The difference in standards between the ordinary suburban hospitals & the London teaching hospitals was enormous. Nurses from our hospital, Westminster, had nursed King George VI, our Queen's father  during his final illness. Anyway there are two plots in this film, contrasting the dirty, rundown British hospital with an American hospital as seen in the Dr Kildare series which was very popular in the UK at that time. The contrast between the dirty British hospital & the gleaming space-age corridors of the American hospital is breathtaking. All British people should watch this film. Our National Health Service seems to be in another decline, I have just returned home from hospital, now aged 66 & wonder what happened to ""nursing"". Patients are no longer tended. You get on with it or God help You!",1330214400,4,1245,4.78139534883721
