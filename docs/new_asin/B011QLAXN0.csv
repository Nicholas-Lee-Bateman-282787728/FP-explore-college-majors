8724949,5,B011QLAXN0,"This was a feel-good movie about a single man, Ray Ray, who was left with the care of his sister's six children after their parents were killed in a car accident.

The children had to come to live in his small apartment in Brooklyn because their house was going into foreclosure.  At first, chaos ensued.  The children were not being properly cared for.  However, Tio Papi, as the children came to call Ray Ray, eventually properly cared for the children and fixed his apartment.  Child Services, however, stepped in and took the two youngest from Tio Papi when the youngest child ran off.  Ray came to dearly love each child.  Ray hired an attorney to fight for his right to keep all six children.

Ray is well played  by Joey Dedio.  The supporting cast, especially the children, is exellent.",1530576000,,794,4.64748201438849
8724950,5,B011QLAXN0,"Very rarely does a ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" type movie take place in Washington Heights, a predominantly Dominican neighborhood. But this one does, and it stays true to form, and true to the neighborhood. I won't give away any of the all - too - familiar plot, with its slightly unusual, but not surprising ending. Frankie Faison, and Elizabeth Rodriguez, currently starring in ""Orange Is The New Black,"" provide the only familiar faces, although Kelly McGillis is in it, but she is hard to recognize more than 25 years away from starring in ""Top Gun"" and ""The Accused""...
Very quickly, the story is; wild uncle ends up with his sister's children. He has difficulties, they have difficulties, but then they start to love each other. Then, you - know - what happens, but don't worry, because then you-know - what happens.
The neighborhood is real, the people are real. In the end, it's a great ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" type movie.  You did say you like those, right?",1469318400,2,963,4.732142857142857
