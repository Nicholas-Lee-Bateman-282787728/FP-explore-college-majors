8749341,5,B01B622CX8,"I was looking for another group similar to SNSD since their down to only five members now and won't be making any more music in the near future. This group doesn't disappoint and also has some very catchy tunes.
  One unique difference of all the kpop acts I've seen is an excellent live band backing them in this concert. The guitarist rocks out sometimes.
  Like SNSD your bound to like each member but Eunji is my favorite. Eunji is the best singer and Bomi might be the best dancer.
  Each member also perform an excellent individual song. Eunji's voice soars in hers while Chorong does a sexy number that will knock your socks off. Bomi starts off hers playing the drums. The others do enjoyable dance tunes.
  This concert doesn't have the huge production values of an SNSD concert but don't let that deter you from seeing or purchasing it. This concert seems to get better with each viewing.",1521590400,,898,4.60377358490566
