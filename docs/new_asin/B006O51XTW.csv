5008517,5,B006O51XTW,"I'm a new fan, having found Chayanne late last year.  I now have most of his albums and videos.  This Blu ray concert video is all that I had hoped for.  It is the closest that I have come to seeing him in a concert performance.  It's also my first Blu Ray and I'm glad I invested in the player as well as a sound system.  The video's clarity was amazing and it succeeded in providing a closeness with the audience. He's a beautiful artist and I look forward to seeing what he does next.",1333152000,,487,4.08421052631579
5008518,4,B006O51XTW,"Everytime I get a Bluray version of a concert I expect to be blown away with the Image and sound and unfortunately it`s not the case here. Yes it`s a good show but the front row feeling is not there. The Accoustic of the concert is not there I did try the three sound option DTS'DOLBY DIG' AND PCM in different combination and still something was misssing. Too much base I even turned down my subwoofer which is rare. I have seven speakers and the division in sound was not there. I might be in a way to fussy about Sound but songs after songs I thought I was hoping  to get hooked to the show. The complicity that you feel between the musician chorist and the performer was not there.

To me regular Dvd with dolby 5.1 sound give better accoustic results in many case. The picture is sharp but not blasting with colors.

All in all the songs and performance are excellent Chayanne is outstanding but I`m still not sure if I`ll watch this again soon.

Fans will be satisfied with the show but not Blown Away like I expected.",1331251200,9,1024,4.317708333333333

8501592,4,B006O51XTW,I enjooyed many of the songs performed on the DVD and would have loved it more in english.  It would have been nice if some of the sweat could have been wiped away from Chayanne's face.  That was somewhat distracting but I enjoyed the DVD and I knew that it was not in english when I made the purchase.,1362096000,,302,4.101694915254237
