8108650,5,B000EDWKVA,Next chapter in the series for me and its great. Ive been hunting these dvd set down 1 at a time fir the last few years and most have been pretty inexpensive. For some reason this and the next one cost way more than the others. Makes me wish i just waited for the bluray set instead.,1456963200,,283,3.982456140350877
8108651,5,B000EDWKVA,"As like all the other box sets the art work on the cardboard case drawn by Alex Ross is outstanding and the individual covers of the DVD cases is just the same taken from the covers of the maxi series comics, the first 2 DVD's are the actual episodes which are completely uncut but have put new voices over the top which is now much closer to the original Japanese translation, the 3rd disk like in all the other box sets I personally find is nothing special, I find the only interesting thing about them are the visual interviews that you have with the voice actors.

Putting Gatchman next to G Force I find this DVD a little bit better, (I did miss the G Force Music though as I always did like it) but putting it next to BOTP, I find Gatchaman to be far far superior as BOTP really did not make any sense as the original cartoon had been cut to pieces and added new parts with the 2 stupid robots known as 7 Zark 7 and 1 Rover 1, Keyop which his real Japanese name is Jinpei speaks normal and does not have that stuttering/stammering/voice impediment which was quite frankly unbelievable even as a child I remember it being quite annoying.

Overall I am glad I picked this box set up and will continue to get all 9 of them, if you are a Battle of the Planets or G Force fan and get the chance to get this box set get it right away as box set 6 is now the most difficult one to find as ADV for some strange reason are no longer making them.",1244419200,3,1442,4.109929078014185
8108652,4,B000EDWKVA,"Gatchaman started out in 1972 as a 105 episode serial that tried to address the topics of family, technology, and responsibility.  It was very successful in Japan, and spawned two sequel series (Gatch II and Gatch F), each with about 50 more episodes.  In the late 70's, hoping to capitalize on the Star Wars craze, Sandy Frank bought the rights to the first series.  He cut some of the more violent scenes, added an R2-D2 kind of robot, and redubbed 85 of the episodes to make them appear as if they take place in Space.  Frank's target audience was kids, so the show became a collection of individual episodes rather than an overall arc of episodes.  Most Americans are probably familiar with Frank's production as Battle of the Planets; here we have the original Japanese source material, which is better in *almost* every respect than BOTP.

-This set contains 2-dvd's of episodes, and one of extras.

The first disc contains episodes 61-66: We get some more info on Ken and the Red Impulse, and get to see an episode that was never translated in Battle of the Planets.

67-72 are on the second disc.  Highlights include the first glimse of Berg Katse (why the long hair????), Gatchaman's discovery of Sosai X (the man behind Katse), and a general ramp up in the excitement of the show as it builds to a conclusion.

-I commend ADV on the extras:  Each episode disc has one show with a commentary by one (or two) of the voice actors.  This would be fascinating if they could get somebody involved with the original show, but it's disappointing that the actors make silly jokes, and barely talk about the show they're supposed to be commenting on.  The extras disc is certainly worthwhile though.  It's got audition footage, character profiles, actor interviews (again, a little silly at times), production galleries (this one shows a lot of the French stuff produced) and some sketch galleries.

I'm saving 5 stars for eps 93-105, so this one gets four.

The second disc contains episodes 67-72",1150588800,5,1998,4.747826086956522
