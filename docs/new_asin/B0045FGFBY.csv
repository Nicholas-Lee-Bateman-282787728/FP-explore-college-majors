The ""Dick Tracy"" comic strip began around 1930 when Chester Gould created it for the `Chicago Tribune' (""The World's Greatest Newspaper""). Some said Dick Tracy was based on Eliot Ness, the famous Prohibition Agent of the US Treasury Department. Its purpose was to influence public opinion for the support of the police in Chicago and elsewhere. It was liked by adults because of its cleverness and stories that appealed to the public. Its villains were famous for their distinctive features, a belief fostered by some criminologists that is now out of date. Some of the ""James Bond"" novels also featured villains with some physical deformity. It was continued after the retirement of Chester Gould, but was dropped from my local newspaper in the 1970s. Comic strips, like TV series, have a variable lifetime. [I only use VHS EP versions as a last resort.]

These four movies came from the RKO film factory. The first two used actor Morgan Conway. He  was replaced by Ralph Byrd for the last two. Byrd played ""Dick Tracy"" in the serials of the 1930s. There is more comic relief in the later pictures. Its popularity showed it met the needs and wants of its audiences (fighting crime in the city). There was no mention of corrupt politicians or similar scandals, even in the big city where this originated. The comic strip would also have interesting facts and tips for the general public. These Hollywood movies were low-cost productions compared to ""The Thin Man"" series. Crime dramas continue as a staple for movies and television today.
