8167547,5,B000DLAHG8,"This is an important educational film by highly qualified leaders and experts.  It is pitched at a level to make it understandable by all.  It succeeds in treating this complex subject in the fast cutting, sound-bite, pastiche style that audiences now prefer. You could say this trivialises the subject but as all the relevant data is shown and key players - led by the former US Treasury Comptroller of Accounting - speak direct to camera it passes muster as a serious piece of education.  I think it fits the times and place very well.  It is better researched, more factual and more important than Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.  Unfortunately, though the subject of accounting and debt control is regarded a ""A Boring Truth"".  The style of presentation of this film goes as far as you can in overcoming the tedium of the matter.",1249516800,,834,4.756944444444445
8167548,5,B000DLAHG8,"This is a FANTASTIC documentary that covers the national debt and what will happen if we do nothing about it.  In that sense it is very similar to I.O.U.S.A.  But unlike I.O.U.S.A., Time-Bomb also covers the risks of inflation, and what will happen to the US if foreigners decide to stop supporting the dollar b/c of a lack of confidence in the US economy and its massive debt.  Other topics include:
a) How the US has transitioned from a creditor nation to a debtor nation, and how history has not been kind to the debtors
b) The risk of hyperinflation
c) cooking the books - Accounting fraud committed by the US government
d) Wealth is created by savings and investment, not spending (it's pathetic that this even has to be covered, but look at the state of affairs today)
e) How future generations will see their payroll taxes DOUBLE if nothing is done
f) Derivatives: legalized fraud (too bad nobody listened...)
g) The Founding Father's opinions on debt
f) The only realistic solutions are increasing taxes or cutting spending (and I know how government will only waste the money it gets from tax increases, so really there's only 1 realistic solution).

You hear from the man on the street, major economists, and government big wigs.  Bottom line - excellent documentary.  Wish I had seen it sooner",1234137600,,1304,4.747787610619469
8167549,1,B000DLAHG8,"this is the worst documentary i've ever seen.  the first review was obviously done by the filmmaker or his mother.  the editing is horrible and the graphics look like they were done on a commodore 64.  this must be a student film because most of the interviews are college students or college professors.

this movie is incredibly boring and the graphics really get in the way.  god, this thing was bad.",1205366400,2,403,4.619718309859155
8167550,3,B000DLAHG8,"First, the message is very important, and its why I gave it 3 stars, but its poorly edited and produced which is why I can't give it 5.

Just to give an example of the annoying features, an economist will say something like, the deficit is a huge problem that no one in congress wants to deal with, like an ""an elephant in the living room"", and then a still picture of an elephant will transition in, in case the viewer forgets what an elephant looks like.  Another example is a computer graphic of a bomb exploding.. this is played after every segment, dozens of times, making me sick.

The video is littered with all these kinds of amateurish graphics and pictures that add nothing, and possible detract from what's being said... its as if the film maker picked up a copy of Premiere a week ago and went nuts with silly editing and transitions.

Its a shame because I really wanted a dvd that I could lend to friends about this topic.  There is at least one other dvd out there that presents this subject matter, in a **MUCH** better way:
""60 Minutes - Wake Up Call (March 4, 2007)""

originally aired on 60 Minutes, but now sold here on Amazon.  Its a bit pricey for this 12 minute segment, although you can probably find this ""Dirty Little Secret"" clip on youtube or the like.",1189209600,2,1279,4.3940677966101696
8167551,5,B000DLAHG8,"Where will the US' incredible mass movement towards taking on more and more debt lead?  After viewing thoughtful and well-intentioned economists, financiers, and politicians implore our government and the public to change from this course of deficit spending, you may be scared.  I am.  Sad, too.  Editor/interviewer/photographer/producer John Ince makes a convincing documentary of the difficulties facing the American Empire.  It seems as if a lot of pain for a lot of people likely lies just ahead.  I hope I can spare as many as possible from the worst of what could come.  On the other side of this possible Armageddon, those who survive will be more inlightened and likely eventually live in a new era of an evolved and responsible global society.  I also hope this DVD helps far-sighted and generous individuals prepare themselves for what may come and to prepare to help others.",1151020800,5,886,5.062068965517241
