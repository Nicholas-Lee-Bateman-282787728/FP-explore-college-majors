2400233,5,B000B5IP1A,"As with the first two seasons, it's the continuing story of this talented but dysfunctional family and its hugely successful custom chopper enterprise. Aided by some of the most incredibly talented employees in the world, (Vinnie, Rick, Jim,Cody,etc) they have taken a small family business and turned it into probably the premier custom motorcycle manufacturer in this country. But it is also a study in inter-family relations, a comedy, a drama, and for we ladies, something of a ""babe-fest""! Lots of eye-candy here ladies!!!",1171324800,2,527,5.285714285714286
2400234,1,B000B5IP1A,"This series really sucks. Now, I don't how much of that Paul SR dude is for real or how much of his acting is hyped up for ""Good TV"".  But let me tell you something, if that dude is as insane as he appears on T.V. and I was his son, I'd leave and start my own company.

That series just grates on my nerves, to listen to that jerk scream and yell and put people down all the time and say the F-word like every other word.  It's no wonder his wife divorced him.

Paul Jr. does makes some good bikes and he is really talented, and it's really cool to see the end result.

But you have to deal with hours and hours of that insane man's mental baggage before you can see the final product.

Many times Paul SR. has impaired judgment on many of the things he says and asks of his coworkers. I think cleaning up your work area, while you are working is just insane. It's a shop for gods sakes.

Perhaps he was just abused as a kid and now he's taking it out on his son. Or perhaps ""hollywood"" has written some pretty convincing scripts for him, and he is just an actor.

Spare yourself being bored and the agony of listing to an unbalanced, red neck freak yell and scream.

Just go to their website and see the final products or if you do get the dvd, just fast forward to the end.

better yet, Don't buy into this junk. It's worthless television.

Paul Jr. should get the hell out and start his own company.  He wouldn't be able to run it, he's more of a craftsman, but I think he would evolve and grow much better. A human being can't grow and evlove under the thumb of an abusive jerk like that. Father or no father.

The're probably millionares many times over from ""good acting"" or ""behaving normally"" whatever the case is. So why would they want to mess up a good thing?

If you spend your hard earned money on this DVD, it's only going to end up in your next garage sale in a few years when their stupid show is no longer popular.  You're not buying a classic movie here.

The bikes ARE cool no doubt about it, but you'll look back 10 years from now and say, ""I can't believe I acutally sat through and watched that c*ap!""

This is just junk, hollywood hyped television at it's best. Avoid it.",1145145600,6,2194,4.136792452830188

2400236,5,B000B5IP1A,"I really liked this DVD the fabrication, designs and beautiful bikes they come up with are great. Can't wait to get the Fourth Season.",1140048000,3,134,4.625
2400237,5,B000B5IP1A,"Reality TV may have given us The Bachelor, but it also gave us American Chopper, one of the most-compulsively watchable shows on television today.

This season is the best to date, with some interesting bikes (the I, Robot bike is a whole lot cooler than the movie that inspired it), some classic Senior/Junior blow-outs and, best of all, lots of classic Mikey bits, including Mikey getting his wisdom teeth out and being absolutely out of his gourd on the drugs given to him by his dentist.

The Senior vs. Junior special is not closed-captioned, unlike the rest of the season's shows, for some reason.

This is a value-priced DVD set and a great buy for the many, many fans of American Chopper, whether you like bikes or just enjoy the Teutel family's antics.",1137283200,8,761,4.706766917293233

2400239,5,B000B5IP1A,"I hope I will be able to give this 5 stars.

Hey American Chooper fans. I'm asking like the title says, will this ""slim down"" version of A.C, 3rd season have every episode included?

If you own either season 1 or 2 which was released (like this one will be) much later then the complete box sets from The Discovery Channel's web site, you know that we were stiffed when it came to a complete box set. I know this is a great deal either way like the other two seasons were.

It just feels like a season should...well have every episode from it. I'm sure I'll still get this. If you have any info, it would be appreciated none the less.

*edit*

I picked this up today also. I compared the episode list to those on the Season 3 box set offered by Discovery Channel's web site. It seems the only episode missing is the ""Christmas"" episode. Which isn't that big of a deal. I thought I remembered them doing that in season 2, yet not including it then either. It would have been nice to have had it for the complete season.

For the price compared ($15.99 plus tax at Best Buy, though I bought something else too) to buying directly from Discovery Channel's site you can't go wrong.",1129939200,12,1177,4.3031674208144794

2400248,4,B000B5IP1A,"I don't know if this is really season 3, but at least this 3-disc set includes another 13 episodes of the show. The good thing is that it contains the original aired sequence of the episodes. Belong to season 3 or continuing the episodes of season 2, it doesn't matter. Of course it's not the complete ""third"" season, episodes like another ""Mikey Special"" and the ""Christmas Special"" are missing. This season ends with the ""David Mann Bike (Biker Legend Chopper)"" episodes. As a DVD description, it has nice intros, episodes selection and the ""Jr. vs Sr."" episode as special feature. Unfortunately for people interesting in other languages, it does NOT include any subtitles (spanish,french,...), but it includes closed captions.",1208649600,,729,5.1344537815126055
