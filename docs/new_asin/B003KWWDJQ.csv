8398995,3,B003KWWDJQ,"Interesting documentary.  I like the interviews with Dirk Drake, River's former Tutor & friend and Matt Ebert.  So sad. This is the first Final 24 Hours series I have watched and I think it is well done.  I remember when River Phoenix died in 1993, it was heartbreaking.  I like most of River's films.  River was one of the great young Actors of his generation.",1435622400,,361,4.492307692307692
8398996,3,B003KWWDJQ,"I most likely wouldn't purchase any more Final 24 dvd's. Didn't find it that interesting and did particularly like the dramatization. It was somewhat informative, but not quite what I was expecting~not much that wasn't already publicized.",1364774400,3,238,5.45945945945946
8398997,5,B003KWWDJQ,"I have been a person who somehow got heavily interested in the details surrounding Hollywood and music's most famous deaths such as, Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and of course River Phoenix! This gives a very detailed account into the final 24 hours into River's death! From every publication I have read and every interview I have heard from peers and family members close to River this documentary is very accurate.",1354838400,7,442,4.986486486486487
8398998,4,B003KWWDJQ,"This made me think about my mixed relations to the subject.  River was popular in my age bracket.  However, I personally never saw ""Stand By Me.""  While I clearly think of Jim Belushi as ""John's brother,"" I don't think about River when I think about Joaquin.  So I approached this documentary not as a fan, but not as a hater either.
There is a way that I do relate.  One interviewee said something like, ""This was a time when America was interested in the dark side and loveable losers.""  I was finishing high school around the time of grunge and Kurt Cobain and Seattle.  So when I lump River in with that ilk, his passing and its relevance really stands out or gains currency.
In this series, they move back and forth from the subjects' last hours to their reasons for their fame.  The series is purposely non-linear.  I didn't know about River's youth in Latin America as a missionary.  The sect to which his family belonged sounded like that of Maggie Gyllenhaal's character in ""Away We Go.""  I applaud Gus Van Zant's artistry, but as the adult in the ""Idaho"" production, this work does make me wonder if he could have curbed some of the drugs use with its stars.
I never knew that River was tight with Flea of the Chilis.  I was amazed to see a photo in which Flea licked River.  The work stated that River took a huge ""speedball"" when Flea wouldn't allow him to jam onstage.  It doesn't say if Flea ever felt guilty about River's death.  I mean, I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose, but the question is now in my head.
This work interviews a guy named Matt Ebert.  It's never stated whether he's related to Roger.  He's hot with a big nose, but not DESPITE the big nose.  I mean, his big nose adds to his hotness.  I wonder what he's doing now?
This work may be a good thing to show to older teens and early 20-somethings to think about the dangers of narcotics.",1288137600,12,1869,4.3497109826589595
