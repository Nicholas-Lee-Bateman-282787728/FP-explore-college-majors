4117356,4,B003F2LH34,"I bought this for my 9 year old son who is old enough to REALLY appreciate the fun of Indiana Jones, but young enough to be REALLY bothered by some of the violence in IJ.

This is the PERFECT solution.  FUN, FUNNY, and in the same action vein as Indiana Jones, but without the violence.

Noah Wylie is great, and seeing Bob Newhart back in action is something the grownups will enjoy.

RECOMMENDED for those with kids 6-13 who like action/adventure.",1331856000,4,449,4.506172839506172

If I had known to do so, I would have seen that the Subtitles are in Dutch.  -- A bit of a disappointment; because I sometimes need to use the subtitles (in English).

4117389,4,B003F2LH34,"This set contains the made for TV movie trilogy that was not quite an outright spoof/parody of (in the scary movie franchise vein), but definitely a tongue-in-cheek, cheesy, take-off on the Indiana Jones movies.  It stars Noah Wyle in his first, and really only, post ER main role until appearing on the series Falling Skies.  The movies aired in 2004, 2006, and 2008 after Wyle was transitioning from ER as a series regular to a recurring character and continued after he had pretty much left ER altogether.  He plays a perpetual student in his 30s named Flynn Carsen, who has 22 degrees and counting lives with his mother and is a stereotypical geeky loser.  If you can buy Wyle in that kind of a role then the movies pretty much work.  After essentially getting kicked out of school (by being granted an early degree) he is invited to apply for the position of Librarian at the Metropolitan Museum in NY.  As he finds out, there is much more to the job than one would think.

The DVD set contains all three movies, Quest for the Spear, Return to King Soloman's Mines, and Curse of the Judas Chalice.  Only the movies are included, there are no extras like deleted scenes, commentaries etc.  I will not go into detail of the plots of the movies, but they mainly involve Wyle's character and usually a gorgeous female co-star to provide a love interest for Flynn trying to track down and recover some artifact that in the wrong hands could destroy the world, so it can be taken to the Library for safekeeping.  None of the movies are all that deep, nor do they take themselves all that seriously.  If you know that going into them, and that would not bother you, then chances are you will enjoy them.

The set is available on blu-ray, but given the price difference between the blu-ray set and the DVD set (over $30 vs less than $10), you may just want to get the DVDs or stream them.  Given that the special effects are on the lower-budget side and would not really be enhanced all that much by the higher-definition media, nor are there any extras or special features included, it really does not make it worth shelling out the extra money for the blu-rays.  In my opinion anyway.  All-in-all they are good, but not great movies.  They also set up the world of the Librarians TV series, which is currently airing on TNT, and is, in my opinion, better than these original movies.",1516060800,8,2381,4.540983606557377
4117390,4,B003F2LH34,"Good fun movies with a nice humorous touch. Won't win an Oscars, but very enjoyable.",1515974400,,84,4.666666666666667
4117391,3,B003F2LH34,"Flynn Carsen, 32 years-old and a professional student has been kicked out of college after getting only 22 degrees. He is dispiritedly going through the newspaper job ads when a strange envelope comes in the mail. It's from the Metropolitan Public Library, ""You have been selected to interview for a prestigious position."" It turns out its him and a hundred other people. But Flynn's the one who lands the job as Librarian with a 6-month trial period.

Many other people enter those doors with the crouching lions in front, but only a special few get to access the REAL library behind hidden doors. The real library has artifacts of myth and legend. As Judson, head of the library tells Flynn, ""Some of the items in the library violate the known laws of science. But that is only because our brains are so small we haven't come up with laws to explain them.""

One of those items is one of three parts of the Spear of Destiny. Whoever joins the three parts has a spear of awesome power and can take over the world. On Flynn's very first night, ninja's break into the library and steal it's spear part. Flynn's mission, as explained by Judson and Charlene, the library administrator, is to use an ancient book and recover all three parts of the spear for the library. Good thing the bumbling Flynn isn't sent into the wild alone.

That is ""Quest for the Spear"", the first of ""The Librarian"" made-for-TV movies, first airing on TNT. The other two movies follow the same general formula. This is family fare in the vein of the the movies shown on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" (19691979). Though I don't think any of The Librarian movies are as good as the best of Disney.

The first movie originally aired in 2004. ""Return to King Solomon's Mines"" followed in 2006, with ""Curse of the Judas Chalice"" in 2008. The movies are comedy-adventures with adequate bad guys and far-fetched fantastical plots. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin are good as Judson and Charlene. The first movie has Kyle Maclachlan as the man out to rule the world. Sidekicks are pretty good. See Stana Katic in the third movie, just before she became Detective Kate Beckett on ""Castle"" (2009-2016).

English subtitles are available on all three movies. ""The Curse of the Judas Chalice"" has four Bonus Features:
...A... ""Deleted Scenes"" (7 minutes) Three extended scenes.
...B... ""Visual Effects Deconstruction Sequences"" (7 minutes) For 11 scenes in the movie, they show the green screen as filmed and the actual altered scenes.
...C... ""A Look Behind the Monastery Scene"" (3 minutes) A short video of a rehearsal.
...D... ""Previews"" Trailers for 5 other movies.

I didn't dislike the three Librarian movies, they are OK, with the 1st, ""Quest for the Spear"" better than the rest.

4117407,4,B003F2LH34,"OK, I admit it: I love these cheesy Tomb Raider rip-offs! Noah Wyle did a great job with these, the only drawback being the gaps were too long between sequels, and they needed more of the [very tastefully done] T&A they did have. Properly handled, these could have been a long-running serial featuring the ingenue-of-the-month and had a HUGE following; as it is, they're mostly forgotten. And of course, the bad guys are never bad enough to actually scare anyone [""Ho ho, let me lock you in this totally contrived death-trap, while I wander off & you escape. AGAIN.

Just a few notes:
As other reviewers stated the quality of the movies do switch, at times, from Blu Ray to DVD quality.  But nothing too bad.
In the first movie (Quest for the Spear)- there are a few scenes cut out, but not in the other movies.
There is not DVD menu and it will automatically play.  You will have to go into the DVD settings to turn off closed captions to disable the Dutch subtitles.",1431907200,6,490,4.293478260869565

Not sure why it was mixed in with the DVD's that work for this region.",1428796800,,295,3.9
4117478,5,B003F2LH34,"Loved the show, couldn't understand the Dutch subtitles. Lots of fun.  The hero's love interest in each DVD (all different) is a wonderful addition to all three shows. Recommended as light, fun and occasionally very exciting action-entertainment.",1428710400,,246,5.648648648648648
4117479,2,B003F2LH34,"The two stars aren't reflective of the series. The three made for TV movie length episodes are fine and entertaining. 4 stars. Kyle MacLachlan is not the lead male actor in the series as it indicated under title, it's Noah Wyle. What also isn't mentioned in the title listing are the series actors Jane Curtin and Bob Newheart. These two are the ""gatekeepers"" of the ""Library"". The term ""library"" is actually a misnomer for what it really is, and that it is a repository for artifacts from history, archeology, and paleontology. The episodes are a combination of adventure, drama, and light situational comedy. Two actresses that star in the series in different episodes, are known to American audiences are Gabrielle Anwar (Burn Notice), and Katta Stanic (Castle). The series was obviously inspired by the Indiana Jones franchise, while nothing can compare to the original Indiana Jones movie, the series is entertaining none the less.

So why only two stars? It has nothing to do with the series itself, but with formating mechanics of this foreign release. This was released through a Dutch distributor in English, with Dutch subtitles. You can't remove the Dutch subtitles from the screen in the new 3 disc set in the BluRay format.",1427328000,,1236,4.971014492753623

I did not know until trying to watch this that the case was in Dutch on the back side, nor the subtitles during the movies. I do not mind subtitles, but I like having the choice to turn them on/off. The irony in this purchase is that I live in Germany and if I wanted a movie with Dutch subtitles, I would have driven there. I had this sent to my parents house in Tx during my recent trip home.

Even though they are a little pricey for older, TV movies, I was happy to pay it so that we could watch them without commercials. I sure was dismayed when they arrived and the only subtitles available were in Dutch! Apparently that was mentioned in extremely small print in the product description, but I have never imagined having to worry about checking for something like that before. Something that I didn't see mentioned in the information is the fact that all of the printing on the case is in Dutch also. I guess I'm not upset enough about it to return them, but wish I had realized ahead of receiving them, especially since they were a gift for my 10 year-old grandson. Even though we are both blessed with normal hearing, we just frequently watch things with the close-captioning on. It's a habit I got into when my kids were young and I would watch TV late at night and didn't want the sound to disturb them. I think it has actually helped both of my grandchildren to be better readers! Anyway, in reading some of the other reviews, I realized that I am also surprised that the picture quality isn't better, considering they are supposedly Blu-ray.",1381881600,2,1244,4.582959641255606

4117570,3,B003F2LH34,I watched the region 4 release recently as the series was on special. The  special effects were  superb considering that it  was made for TV. The episodes  are fast moving and the acting is  great. The 3 episodes  all follow a similar pattern- the baddies  are cliched and they always look  like  they are the nasty  ones. Why can't  bad people in the movies  look just as  spunky as the  main characters? There is little logic  to many of the scenes. The  hero always gets his girl in the end but by the time the next episode comes round he has a  new girlfriend. No continuity in that respect. The  stories are predictable  and inoffensive and the violence is  very tame. They are certainly never boring. I  wonder why they stopped after only 3 feature length episodes?,1354147200,,771,4.481751824817518

4117572,3,B003F2LH34,"A number of reviews have complained of the PAL format and Region 2 coding of this product. These problems can only apply to the DVD release. The Blu-ray release described here is Region Free, and all current Blu-ray players (and DVD players too) handle PAL and NTSC equally well. Only Region coding can be an issue. This product has other problems.

The biggest problem is that it is incomplete. The run times of the individual DVD movies are as follows:

Quest for the Spear:  106 Minutes (Includes 15 Minutes Not Seen on TV)
Return to King Solomon's Mines:  92 Minutes
Curse of the Judas Chalice:  90 Minutes (Approx.)
Total  288 Minutes

The total run time listed for this product is 266 minutes. What happened to the other 22 minutes?

My theory is that each movie was first edited for broadcast on Dutch TV. Assuming that each was edited to fit into the same two-hour time slot in the same way, each hour of each movie would consist of 44 minutes 20 seconds of program content and 15 minutes 40 seconds of commercials. That compares with the current US broadcast standard of 44 minutes of program content and 16 minutes of commercials per hour. (Commercial time includes public service announcements.) Each Dutch edited movie would thus be 88 minutes 40 seconds long, which would add up to exactly 266 minutes. You can easily calculate the amount of program content deleted from each movie. All three are affected, not just Quest for the Spear as others have reported.

The other problem is the probable lack of special features. Each of the DVD releases lists several special features such as an introduction, featurettes, commentaries, stills galleries, deleted scenes, and subtitles in English and Spanish. This product may have the same, different, or even more special features, but only Dutch subtitles are referenced.

In my view, a Blu-ray release should contain more, not less, than the previous DVD release. I am always highly motivated to upgrade my DVDs to Blu-ray whenever possible, but in this case I will sadly pass.",1353628800,,2036,4.858381502890174
4117573,2,B003F2LH34,"This Dutch produced set of blu-ray DVDs is a poor excuse for the product offered.  The first two movies in this trilogy (especially the first) look to be poor transfers of the movie off faulty prints.  Regular DVDs would have looked just as good, maybe better.  The third film does look good and crisp though.  Still, I would flag the buyer off of this particular product.

As for the movies themselves you can read my reviews of the individual movies or know that I starred them thusly:

Quest for the Spear: 3 stars

Return To King Solomon's Mines: 4 stars
