8006458,3,B00014NE4O,"This video is for people familiar with dance or who learn well by watching. The instruction is through demonstration without explaination, so a beginner or novice would not do well by using this video. However, the patterns and ammalgamation sequences are unique, stylish, practical, and effective to those with a working knowledge of the dance being demonstrated.",1354924800,,364,5.4035087719298245
8006459,4,B00014NE4O,I found the instruction esy to follow without being Condescending!  All I needed to prevent myself from looking like a gradeschool danccer.,1286064000,,139,5.318181818181818
8006460,5,B00014NE4O,The dvd gives lessons in a very easy to understand method. It provides a good basis for going out and having some fun dancing. I suggest using this DVD to learn with your girlfriend or boyfriend.,1181606400,,195,4.444444444444445
8006461,2,B00014NE4O,This dance video is brief viewing of advanced dancing and did not help with learning how to dance. I would not recomend this video. I feel this is money wasted.,1170806400,4,160,4.366666666666666
8006462,1,B00014NE4O,"This DVD did not serve the purpose it was intended for. It fails as an instructional tool no matter what level you are on. If you are a beginner, you will be really dissapointed as this video does not address some of the basic rules of dancing, it is not very detail, and it does not guide you step by step. For those who have some kind of dancing knowledge, you will also find it dissapointing because the moves taught on the video are really basic and not very attractive.",1162944000,7,474,4.277777777777778
8006463,1,B00014NE4O,"I was more than disappointed in this DVD. As someone with two left feet, I was interested in learning all the different kinds of dance that it advertises.

First, there is almost no instruction. At the beginning of each session they will show the male part for about 5 seconds. You just watch the guy dance. He doesn't even do a simple step more than once! He moves right into intermediate moves. Then add the female part for about 5 seconds and I guess they think you'll know how to dance.

Secondly, no considerable amount of time is spent ""practicing."" This is related to the first point becuase they show you the step and then move on. There's not a single, ""let's try that again."" They're great dancers, but I don't know what I'm doing.

I wish I could return this awful excuse for ""beginner's dance instruction.""",1161993600,11,818,4.551020408163265
8006464,2,B00014NE4O,"This video doesn't teach you anything about how to dance. For starters every type of dance is broken up into sections that only last 5 minutes or so. Every move is demonstrated for you very quickly and only twice so that if you can't learn a move within the ten seconds that its shown you have to keep rewinding. To make it worse you are only showed the man's steps and the woman is just told to do the opposite. Trust me, just doing the opposite is not that easy. I can't recommend any other videos because I haven't tried them, but if you have no clue how to do any basic moves, as I don't, Do not waste your money on this DVD.",1099872000,50,629,4.080645161290323
8006465,5,B00014NE4O,"Since early last year, I have been volunteering at Shady Oaks Retirement Community.  My time there did not start well, as I have few talents that appeal to a large group - stand-up comedy and solo bass guitar being two of them.  On a whim, I purchased this DVD.
Boy, am I glad I did!  Although I must have knocked over my Cookie Monster lamp 40 times in the course of practicing my spins and twirls around the living room, I finally became a pretty nice hoofer, although it didn't come without stepping on Mrs. Loman's feet a few times (she forgave me).
Thanks for this DVD, I am now the king of Shady Oaks.  The ladies line up for Leonard, and he dances all night (7 pm - 8:30 pm).",1085443200,27,682,4.183206106870229
