5893755,5,B00E8A0P80,There are some great workouts in this dvd! It has 5 ten minute workouts plus a bonus amazing abs work out. One of the workouts is a High Intensity Interval Training workout which is definitely the most challenging for me. The great thing about this DVD is that you can easily chose the order you want to do the workouts in if you chose to do more than one. I try to workout to this DVD a couple times a week and I'm already noticing a difference after just 2 weeks. Christine does the workout with you and you can tell it's not easy even for her!,1383004800,,546,4.11214953271028
5893756,5,B00E8A0P80,"This is the best 10 minute solution dvd I own and I own a lot of them.  In 10 minutes you will feel the burn.  Christine Bullock has picked some creative and easy to learn moves to sculpt your butt, abs, thigh and legs.  I love love the HIIT and cardio sections because they really get your heart rate up and work the muscles. I feel like I can do 10 minutes and feel like I have worked out for 30 minutes and I appreciate that being my schedule is busy.  Ladies and gentlemen you will not be disappointed.  You will get results with this one!",1382572800,,543,4.084905660377358
5893757,5,B00E8A0P80,"I am extremely impressed with the 10 minute solution butt lift. The Instructor Christine Bullock is very informative during the workout with instructions, and alternatives. The dvd offers 6 segments of 10 minute workout. You can choose your favorites or challenge yourself with the full 60 minutes exercise session. I am on day six; I love and look forward to my daily 60 minute workout with Christine. Some of the exercises are hard and others are easy. She has such great,different, fresh new ideas compared to traditional workouts. My advice for the hard positions are ""do your best today and tomorrow do even better"". Most important never give up on yourself! Do something special for you; buy this dvd and create the body of your dreams....",1382400000,,745,4.920634920634921

5893759,5,B00E8A0P80,"If You enjoy a really good work out, and want to really feel that you are getting one,  then this 10 Minute Solution Butt Lift is for you.  If you just want to hope for the best and have an easy workout, then don't buy this DVD.
Me, my Granddaughter and my Daughter ( 3 Generations ) all did this DVD together.  We got a very good workout and it kicked our butt.. in a good way.  We could all feel it in our butt muscles.
My Granddaughter liked it so much that she took it and won't give it back.",1381536000,,496,3.881188118811881
5893760,5,B00E8A0P80,This is an excellent exercise DVD.  Many of the moves are unique to me. I felt sore the next day.,1381104000,3,97,3.85
5893761,5,B00E8A0P80,"I highly recommend this DVD - I workout at least 5 days a week, with a trainer and classes, but this DVD is a great solution for those who cant make it to the gym. Depending on how hard you push yourself, you will feel the burn right away and the next day (and probably the day after!)  I really appreciate the variety of workouts offered, you can do 10 mins or up to an hour of great, sweat-inducing, butt lifting work.
The instructor, Christine, is great with cues and really knowledgable. I love workout videos, I am a fan of them, dating all the way back to the Jane Fonda days, and Christine really delivers!
You will feel this workout in your tush, no question. But you will also notice slimmer hips, toned legs and a firmer core. I am obsessed!

5893762,4,B00E8A0P80,"This DVD offers six sweaty 10-min. workouts to improve one's lower body as well as strengthen the back. ""Butt Lift"" is a nice hybrid of styles that should please wide range of people with various fitness backgrounds. Although this is a well-thought, solid routine, which will improve one's problem zones and tone the whole body, I gave it only 4 stars, as some workouts need to be modified to be safe.

Here is my Note of Caution to people with past back injuries: SLOW DOWN, listen to your body, hold the pose properly - you will have results and avoid injuries.  Don't rush into cardio and high intensity segments right away. Moderation is a key. I would recommend do these 3 workouts first:
- Upright Booty
- Butt & Thighs
- Amazing Abs (bonus workout)

Enjoy and stay healthy!",1380844800,109,780,4.597122302158273
5893763,5,B00E8A0P80,"I purchased this through another site (not AMAZON), but figured I'd give credit where credit is due.  I'm an avid workout video junky.  I hate the gym, so I try to get my hands on as many good, quality videos that I can do in the privacy of my own home as I can.  I typically stick to Jillian Michaels, and a few others, but hadn't been able to find a great one specifically for ""the butt"", so I figured I'd give this a whirl.  First of all - I initially through this was JUST a 10 minute work out, but was pleasantly surprised to see that there were actually 5 different 10 minute ""butt work outs"" and one bonus 10 minute ab work out.  I know, it says this on the cover, but apparently I just focused on the 10 Minute part at the top.  So, just an FYI - this isn't like those old ""8 Minute Abs vidoes"" where it's literally just 8 minutes of so-so moves and you're done.

I went into this thinking it would probably be pretty easy, but hoping there were be some good moves I would work into my existing routines.  Wrong - NOT EASY AT ALL.  In a good way.  There are many moves in here that I had never even seen before, which was great.  I thought for sure I would be able to do the full 60 minute workout first time around (since, like I said, typically do what I think are really touch videos on the regular), but really surprised when my legs were shot after 3 1/2 of the workouts.

I've been doing 3/4 of the workouts at a time every other day for a little over a week and have already noticed a huge difference.  Definitely a keeper.",1378857600,175,1538,4.069767441860465
5893764,5,B00E8A0P80,"I just received this video yesterday and decided to try it out today. I'm quite active, I go to the gym 4-5 days a week for 90 minutes; 3 times a week I run and twice a week I have two other butt videos that I alternate every other week (Tae-Bo Butt and Booty Barre). I don't like to get bored when I workout so I wanted to find a third video that works the butt that doesn't need any extra equipment (ie: weights, exercise ball etc).  I saw this one and watched snippets of each segment and thought it looked pretty good.

Well. I did this video this morning after my gym workout and Holy Hannah was it TOUGH! I like how it's broken out into 5 ten minute sessions (which I did all 5) as it gives a slight break in between each session and kind of lets you know how far you are and how much is left. As I said, this workout was TOUGH. I was drenched in sweat when I was done and I was too spent to do the ab portion at the end (which I am going to aim to do on Thursday).

This workout isn't remotely boring, which I don't understand the reviews that state that it is. Sure, if all you're going to do is one ten minute portion over and over and over again it's going to get boring but I was far from bored. It got my heart rate up (there are two portions that are kicked up with cardio) and my legs were shaking and tired at the end. If you think it's boring and you're ""not feeling it"" then you're doing something wrong.

Also, this is definitely NOT for beginners. She does go rather fast and in my opinion is assuming that you know the exercises already so if you're just getting into working out I'd shelf this video until you know what it is you're doing.

I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to add another leg day into their routine and if you do all five of the segments like I did you will be drenched in sweat and completely spent when you're through.",1506988800,4,1880,4.056603773584905
5893765,5,B00E8A0P80,"Great workout that I can customize! Amazing price compared to others. It's 6, 10 minute workouts including one ab workout. They're fairly simple low impact exercises and nice for a beginner or a light day. Also, nice if you only have 10 minutes to spare here or there. I like to change them out and do 3 each day.",1506384000,,313,4.322033898305085
5893766,5,B00E8A0P80,"This workout is no joke.  It may say 10 minute Butt Lift but there are 5 different 10 minute exercises and an additional 10 minute ab workout - all are very tough and have my legs feeling like boiled spaghetti after I'm done.  She moves fast, very fast and the first week I couldn't keep up.  She does one quick demo and then keeps going with the exercise.  Very good workouts that have my legs shaking when I'm done.  I am feeling a difference and my legs feel stronger so I'm looking forward to see the results I will have after doing this for a month.  Great DVD and I recommend it.",1505433600,,585,4.178571428571429

I love that there are 10 minute sections so even when it's difficult (some more than others) it's easy to push through because they are so short!  Having the option to pick and choose which ones you want to do and in what order depending on how much time you have is great. There are also a few moves that I can't quite do fully yet which is good because it gives me something to work towards.  The instructor is encouraging without being annoying - I really love this DVD!  After 6 weeks (2-4 x's a week) I definitely see results!",1494633600,,592,4.212389380530974

5893776,5,B00E8A0P80,"I bought this video to incorporate in addition to doing T25 or Piyo, because I felt like my buns needed some extra attention, and I will say that, I am so impressed with this buns workout video! She does moves that I have NEVER done before, and also other moves I am familiar with from my other work outs I tend to use. But the moves she has you do, works angles of my butt that I do not get worked in other workouts, so I feel like I am getting a thorough buns workout with this, and its a video that could stand alone for lower body days without incorporating with other work-outs. The first day I tried it, I thought I would go through the whole 50 minutes, but after the 3rd video segment, I felt like my buns were thoroughly worked for the day, and I ended up only doing 3. I went back to it the next day to finish off the whole set,  I was grunting through a few of the moves, and I felt really challenged by it. Although I exercise consistently 3-5 a week, this left my muscles sore, so I know it really works!!

The main advice I would give with this video, is knee safety. Make sure you are sticking your butt out and doing wide lunges, because leaning into a narrow lunge will leave you hurting in a bad way after the workout. The first time I did one of her segments with her lunges, I didn't take  wide enough lunges, and my knees were throbbing afterward. But I decided to go back to it again and kept the focus of making wide lunges, and I didn't have knee pain afterward. So just make sure to watch your form.

I like Christine, she is positive, kicks your butt, and is not annoying. I plan to try her other video, Evolution 20, if she can kick my butt here, I want to see what else she's got!",1491609600,6,1708,4.074404761904762

5893778,1,B00E8A0P80,"Not for beginners for sure.  Really hard on the knees.  She goes way too fast.  You cannot modify any exercise - or at least there is no mention of it.
It's just her going super fast through each exercise.  So you can either do it or not.  Unless you are in the shape she is in - ain't gonna happen.
Not even worth me going to the post office and paying for postage to ship it back.  Very disappointed.  I would not recommend if you don't already look like her and are an athlete.  And, if that's the case - do you really need this. Just sayin'",1485216000,,544,4.018691588785047

I usually do 4 out of the 5 workouts and I ALWAYS feel sore the next day. The HIIT butt lift segment is really tough, but it works. My tush definitely looks more firm and round since I incorporated this workout into my regular routine (usually I also do a mix of T25 and Insanity Max 30 workouts on other days). The best part is that I don't need any weights or equipment, yet I always feel sore the next day. I only wish she would put out more Butt Lift videos.

I've used T25, P90x3, Brazil Butt Lift and regular strength training, as well as other HIIT-type workouts and consider myself an upper-intermediate exerciser. I did wonder if this DVD would prove too easy, but I was adequately challenged and am sore in places I don't usually feel, so it worked areas that aren't being hit with my other workouts, despite the fact that I regularly do a LOT of squats and lunges. I was about to order Brazil Butt Lift on DVD ( I had previously been using Beachbody On Demand to stream the workouts) but balked at ordering yet another overpriced, sleekly marketed Beachbody product. I stumbled across this series on Amazon and thought, hey, why not? It's less than $8; if the workouts are terrible, I'll give it away. But I am pleasantly surprised at the burn and the challenge, even if only doing 2 workouts at a time. I have yet to do all 6 in one setting (one is an ab routine). The instructor is also perky/encouraging without being annoying, and the music is better than in most workout vids.

I have tried 2 of the butt workouts and the ab workout so far and amazingly hard but nothing that will hurt your back or knees if you do the exercises just like the instructor is doing.. I have been sticking to the 3 workouts, but there are 5,  but will report back. when I try them all.  After a month I am already looking better in the jeans! This is not an easy workout. Wow. If you are new to this just do one ten minute. However, you can work up to doing more and in any order. Also great when you are running late as 10 minutes is do-able.

The other negative side of the video is no warm-up. it is very easy to hurt muscles trying to follow&repeat the moves of an ex ballet dancer without any warm-up. I found her voice irritating too. The positive side - the exercises are extremely good and effective for advanced users. If you do sport regularly and an active gym member that workout would correlate the problem zones if you need some extra work on bum&thighs.  I use that video as addition to others workouts. It must be something with the trainer, because I don't want to see that workout too often.

5893859,5,B00E8A0P80,"I have worked 5x a week for over 20 years. I do THE FIRM starting with the original 6 series so I am in pretty good shape from all the weight bearing lunges and squats.  I have tried to add other DVD s The Firm and was quickly bored or didn't feel it gave me a good enough workout to add to my workout regime.  This workout is a whole different story. I felt tightness and some soreness the next day and my butt feels rounder, higher and my legs feel leaner and longer from some of the moves that requires high back kicks.  Each workout is 10 minutes long so you can customize your own 20-30 min workout when you are like me and feel you are not really burning fat if your cardio is less than 20 minutes. The HIIT (high impact workout) will have you sweating and out of breath within the first  minutes, it is that good.

some of the toning here made my thighs feel bigger from the muscle (like some ballet toning workouts) but I have incorporated FIRM on alternate days and do the 10 min solution rest of the week with one rest day.  The Firm also has the weight bearing upper body workout so i get some upper body toning this DVD doesn't offer.  Together is an amazing workout!

I would not recommend this to beginners.",1424044800,2,1221,4.188034188034188

Please, please be careful before using because the moves are fast, mostly advanced, and the instructor does not explain anything about proper form. The workout could be a good challenge for the advanced exerciser who understands how to execute moves safely. I am in good shape but I got overexcited about the third time I worked out to this and injured my back muscles. Mainly, it's the speed of the movements that I find troubling. Jumping lunges were not a problem for me until I did them at the speed this instructor demonstrated. It is no doubt what caused my very painful back spasms.",1423180800,6,624,4.63063063063063

5893866,5,B00E8A0P80,"This is a great DVD to augment your workout routines. I am currently rehabbing my knee and needed to build on my lower body strength. This DVD is broken into ten minute segments - all with a different style and varied moves to strengthen your butt and legs. Some of the moves are classic squats and lunges and some have a sleeker style derived from pilates, barre and dance. I think the instructor is adorable and she works through the moves with you, provides cues on your form and does so without becoming obnoxious. I tend to get really sick of the instructors in DVDs quickly but she doesn't seem to bother me, and I must admit her physique is a motivating factor. I love the varied level of efforts for each routine, the fact that no equipment is required and that the DVD allows you to custom make a workout to include (or leave out) any of the routines you don't want to do if you choose to create your own order. I can also attest to the fact that while I work out routinely, I am sore after doing these routines on consecutive days in the telltale region.

The cardio really gets the heart rate up and the abs bonus is very effective. The instructor packs a wallop in each ten minute segment. She also makes it so much fun.

Some are cardio based, one is pilates based, others are straight toning.  You can select not only how many of the 10 min segments you want to do, but you can also select which order they are played in and it puts it together into one video for you (no having to go back to the menu when one of the 10 minute videos is up to go on to the next).  Brilliant! Also love the instructor (nice personality and not at all annoying) and the moves!  She integrates moves from pilates, barre and ballet so many of the moves are new/never seen before even though I've done a lot of lower body workouts.  It also helps to hit different muscle groups/muscles you've never worked before.  Even though the segments are only 10 minutes, they are individually very challenging.  I am a moderate exerciser.

I did the first 40 minutes (4 segments) in the morning and the last 20 minutes (2 segments) in the evening.  I am happy to report that I feel the burn today which is hard to get to once you start working out regularly.  Though the workout is fast paced throughout, I find circuit #5 is hard as well as the last ab exercise in the ab circuit.  Though I have defined abs, I simply could not get through this last set.

-The instructor: is very sweet! She is great at motivating me to keep going. Her commentary is appropriate, not too much or to little. I also like that there aren't two people in the background, just her working out by herself. Personally I find this less distracting, as the background people in other videos usually have such fake smiles and expressions. The instructor however comes across as very authentic.

The workouts: are very efficient and work many muscle groups at the same time. They incorporate aspects from ballet, pilates, and even kickboxing. The instructor throws all these elements together in a heart pumping workout that gets me sweating everytime. The cardio is definitely the best cardio I've gotten from any of the ""butt' workouts I've done. I find myself wanting to do this video everyday and have to force myself to do other videos.

Overall: One of my favorite things about this workout video is that it doesn't lose it's focus. What I mean by that is, it's a butt workout video. And the focus stays on the butt! Even the segment for abs has a butt focus to it. I've noticed that with other butt videos I've tried, when they venture out into cardio exercises or whole body exercises, the focus on the butt gets lost. But that's not why I buy a butt workout video. I buy it because I want it to focus solely or mainly on the gluts! This instructor does that perfectly.

I own many workout DVDs, including the Brazil Butt Lift program, and this little DVD still has moves I've never encountered.  I think it's a good balance between the different workouts- some with a cardio focus, some with more lunge-type moves, but others that don't have you working your knees so much (I have bad knees, but I can do these workouts).

The music is upbeat, and unobtrusive, though it's not a particularly motivating mix for me. I also love that you can mix, match, and customize the workout session. Great feature, that.

But as much as I enjoy this workout DVD, it's not without some problems. It expects you to jump in feet first, no easing in. On my 20 minute Beach Body DVD, there's a section specifically to familiarize you with all of the exercises that would be presented in the DVD broken down slowly. No such luck with this DVD. On top of that, some of the exercises do require some adjustment because form is favoured over speed (and in some cases, you're expected to not only have good form, but also speed). If you have a dance background, or are used to picking up choreography quickly, then it won't be a big deal, but others might find the moves overwhelming at first. Finally, they say you should have a little floor room when in reality you should have plenty of floor room, at least your size (length and width) times two, to comfortably execute some of the moves.",1387411200,9,1252,4.396551724137931

There are actually several different butt-specific workouts, as well as one ab-specific bonus workout. Despite the short amounts of time, the workouts are actually fairly challenging and fun to do. You can definitely feel the burn and that's something I expect in my workout videos.

One of my favorite things is the fact that the workouts are all pretty different. Instead of having 5 or 6 similar, but slightly different workouts, this DVD features 6 different kinds of workouts that will appeal to tons of different people. There's one that's more bootcamp style, one that's a little ballet, one that uses HIIT, one that's full of kickboxing moves, as well as a few others. People of all different skill levels will be able to complete the exercises.

5893934,4,B00E8A0P80,"That said, I'm not saying this is a gentle workout for the knees.

I am not a super active person. I used to love playing Dance Dance Revolution, and I'd use that to work out until I'd be drenched, legs weak and shaking, heart racing. Ever since my car accident 2 years ago, I haven't been able to do that due to injuries to my knees, shoulders, and ankles.

I've been looking into workouts that I could use to be fit. I've tried yoga, pilates, CRX, and barre. My favorite has been barre, since I could support my joints with the barres when I need to. Yoga is too hard on my joints with my lack of flexibility and all the poses I must get in. CRX and weight workouts hurt my knees way too much.

This video is broken down into 6 10 minutes segments, 5 of them for thighs and 1 for the ab. The DVD allows you to customize it so that you can choose which workouts to do first. Many of the moves have modifications, which is great. Unfortunately, I'd not recommend all of them for anyone who has not had any type of regular workout or has injuries. Then again, maybe I feel this way because I'm not very fit right now.

Let me review these one by one:

Upright Booty: standing up to do the work, but lots of lunging. It was hard for my knees when I tried them.

Cardio Booty Camp: I like this one more. It has some lunges, but lots of cardio moves like running in place and jumping, which actually was more gentle on my knees.

Butt Lift:pretty much kicks, sitting lifts of thighs from behind (gives me cramps) and lunges... the lunges really are painful for me. You probably need to be a little flexible already to do some of this. I do like some of the yoga related moves such as bridge with one leg lifted - it helps strength me a lot in a knee-friendly way.

Butt & Thighs: This is my favorite - pretty much all the moves are easier on my joints, and they are graceful and slower. I actually really enjoyed this. It's not much cardio though.

Hiit Butt Lift: I absolutely love this one. I can do all of the workouts. The jumps and lunges combination makes it not as painful for my knees. Nice cardio workout as well. I think I'd use this on a very regular basis, though it will take some building up to keep up.

Amazing Abs: Wow, talk about hard. It starts out fine, but the last couple of moves on my back are just too much. I need to work up my core before I can handle the full set without stopping. Fortunately, all kind on my knees.

All the segments end with a small yoga-style stretch of the spines and the body.

Christine Bullock is eye candy. Very pleasant to look at. She is also very skilled - I hope I can look like her once I get more of these workouts done. The music of the video is energetic, and Christine is very energetic also. She speaks slowly and clearly.

Those 10 minute segments feel like FOREVER... I need to get in shape.",1387324800,7,2852,4.17304189435337
5893935,5,B00E8A0P80,Love the 'get to the point approach' of this workout.  The ability to customize the workout by choosing which 10 minute sessions you want to do adds a nice element of flexibility.  The movements are refreshingly unique which always challenges new muscles!,1387324800,,255,5.0476190476190474
5893936,5,B00E8A0P80,"There are a lot of lower body workouts out there and I'm going to compare this one with some other recent lower body videos. For some background,  I am a certified fitness instructor and do a TON of DVDs. I am also at an advanced fitness level. I really love this DVD.

10 Minute Solution Butt Lift: First let me say that Christine is Very likable, and is not annoying at all. She talks just the right amount. The menu great. You can pre-select the combination and order of the workouts you want to do, which allows you to customize your workout. There are 5 (10 min) workouts. I like that the warmup isn't long at all (and actually barely there) so if you want to do all 5, you are not having to do a long warmup each time. The moves are basic, and some combinations unique. Of the 5 workouts, each one has a different feel. The HIIT isn't very intense, but is a good light cardio workout. It is more of a mini tabata style workout where you do an exercise for 20 seconds and rest for 10, then do it again. Instead of doing it 8 times like in tabata, you only do each drill twice. The floor exercises are good, but I wish they were a little longer, so I find myself rewinding them and doing them again.

Here is how it compares to the various other lower body workouts I've recently done:

10 Minute Solution Butt lift with Christine Bullock: (released 2013)
More Pilates/ballet based, with a little bit of athletic cardio for two of the 5 workouts. Not an extreme calorie blasting DVD, but you will get your heart rate up a bit. I think this is great for all levels of fitness, but if you are super advanced, you may need to repeat some exercises to really feel it. The menu is great, the moves are great, the instructor is very motivating. I think I will add this to my weekly routine. I really really enjoyed this workout.

Ultimate Sweat and Tone with Angie Gorr: (released 2013)
This is a total body workout but has a 60 min lower body calorie torcher pre-mix. My watch said I burned about 800 calories doing this. This was intense, and I really felt it the next day. The leg tap series is really unique, and time just flew by. You can do this without a step to make it easier, or with a step to make it harder. This is more of a cardio/strength athletic style workout, where Butt Lift is more pilates/ballet based with a little bit of athletic style moves thrown in.

Tonique Premier with Sylwia (not super recent, 2008) but I just discovered it:
This is great for cardio as well as toning. I don't feel the toning as much with this one as I did with 10 Minute Solution Butt Lift or Ultimate Sweat and Tone, but you can make it harder by adding heavier weights (Sylwia uses 2lbs). There are 3 main sections (each 20 min long). The first 20 min you do all variations of squats (typically 30 reps of each type) and then the next 20 min is variations of lunges (30 reps of each type) and the last is the mat series (which is really good) and then finishes up with abs.

Cathe Friedrich's XTrain Series: Cardio Leg Blast DVD (2012)
OK, so Cathe is probably the best instructor out there. However, this wasn't my favorite DVD, but it was good. I think this is more of an intermediate level workout, rather than advanced. Tonique and Ultimate sweat and tone mentioned above are more high-rep workouts. Butt lift and Leg Blast is more of a medium-rep workout. I found myself wanting to do a few more reps to really feel it. However, some people prefer this style where you are changing exercises more often and not doing as many reps. I throw this workout in to get a variety, and like I said..you can't go wrong with Cathe.

Tracy Effinger: Squeeze Lower Body Challenge
I really Like Tracy, but I think I like 10 Min Butt lift better. Tracy; however does do a lot of reps, which I really like. I don't get my heart rate up, but sometimes I'll go for a run and then throw this in. She has some GREAT leg exercises. I think I like her actual Squeeze a little better than Squeeze Lower Body Challenge.

Cardio Barre Ultimate Advanced DVD With Bonus Workouts (2008)
The cardio part isn't super intense, but the toning is the hardest out of any of the DVDs mentioned. I love this workout, but don't like that I don't get that cardio burst I need in the other workouts. However, this is VERY challenging and I can't finish it. I guess my goal for 2014 is to finish this workout!

I've done a TON of DVD's and I've listed some of my favorites, and 10 Minute Solution Butt Lift was just added to it. I'll make it simple. If you are more of a pilates/ballet/barre person you will like this video. If you are advanced and prefer higher reps, cardio and strength you would probably like Ultimate sweat and Tone or Tonique Premiere; however, I strongly encourage people to go beyond their comfort zone. If you are not a pilates/ballet/barre person, this is actually the perfect video to bridge that gap because Christine doesn't do ALL pilates/ballet. She throws in other varieties of exercises, and would be a great challenge for those that are not used to it. If you want an overall toning video with high reps and very little cardio, then Tracy Effinger is the way to go. If you are extremely advanced and want a killer barre video, then cardio barre is your best bet.

I have to say that I just really liked Christine, and no matter what your preference is on workouts, I always encourage my students to try new instructors and get out of their comfort zone. I would highly recommend adding 10 Minute Solution Butt Lift to your collection!

***Also for those of you that mentioned Knee injuries or needing low-impact. This DVD has a variety of both, so depending on your issue and your ability to modify, you may want to stick with a pure low-impact DVD like Tracy Effinger or actually Cathe has an entire low-impact series you could choose from.",1387238400,21,5839,4.3863216266173755
5893937,5,B00E8A0P80,"I loved working out to the 10 Minute Solution: Butt Lift because it was easy for me and being a beginner it was great. I like that you can customize your workout and give your body exactly what it needs.

The ten minutes are just enough to be effective because I can definitely feel it the next day. The workout is quick and gets easier each time I do them. Simple and quick workout, so there will not be any excuses to do it daily.

I've been doing this for over a month and you can begin to see some results now, but I'm sure it will take much longer before I achieve my desired results.",1387152000,,589,4.068965517241379

5893941,4,B00E8A0P80,"My teen-age daughter helped me test out this dvd when it first arrived.  We thought this would be an easy start to resuming our workouts after a couple months break.  We didn't think it could work us as hard as Jillian Michaels does (our favorite dvd-workouts).  We were wrong.  We were feeling this workout for several days, after doing just two 10-minute sections.

The one con for this workout is that it doesn't cue or explain the moves very well.  If you're already familiar with dvd work-outs you'll recognize the moves and be able to follow along more easily than if you're a complete beginner. A beginner will have to watch the instructor carefully for proper form and just practice to get the moves down.

I love the ballet-inspired movements in this workout, as they worked my muscles in a way none of our other dvds does.  It was a new element of exercise for us.

My favorite part of this dvd is that I can program my workout at the start with a warm-up, any order of the exercise segments, and a cool-down.  It's nice to be able to set it all up at the beginning and then just do it, without having to select another segment mid-way through.",1386201600,,1154,4.4523809523809526

This DVD succeeds on two levels. First, offering six options is a great way to maximize value from a 60 minute workout DVD. I've used this for a few weeks off and on and have not grown tired of it at all.

Perhaps more importantly, these workout are hard. You'll can really push yourself in those ten minutes. If not, you can always do it again.

This is a workout DVD that really gives you a lot of bang for your buck. I highly recommend it.",1386028800,,680,4.338582677165355

5893944,4,B00E8A0P80,"Since so many other reviews detail the specifics of this workout, I will only add a few small points. As others have mentioned, this particular workout requires no special equipment. This is a huge benefit for anyone who wants to keep up their workout routine while traveling - no gym or weights necessary to get in a decent workout. I am a moderate exerciser - never a gym rat but always pretty regular about trying to keep my lower body in particular in shape, which I always thought required weight work. I was surprised at the results I have been able to see and feel through the exercises in this video without the use of weights. A combination of both is probably the ultimate but for anyone like me who more often than not prefers the privacy and convenience of working out at home, this does the job and keeps me motivated enough to keep up a regular routine, which in the end is what it takes to make any workout regimen successful.",1385856000,3,941,4.445086705202312
5893945,5,B00E8A0P80,"I loved this workout DVD. There are five butt workouts and a bonus abs workout to choose from. You can do one 10 minute workout or as as many as you would like. On the start page there are instructions for how to create a ""custom workout""

The instructor Christine Bullock does the workouts by herself but she does show some modifications. She is the perfect combination of perky and encouraging without being annoying.

These are not super easy workouts but I feel most of the moves are doable by almost anyone. If your out of shape/ practice like me just go slow. I felt that improved significantly after about five workouts. I still struggle on higher impact portions.

Overall , the best part of these workouts is the approachable nature of just being ten minutes. I promise you after just a few workouts you will want to do more than just ten minutes. I have not lost weight with these ( I am at my ideal weight but weak and jiggly ) but I have gained stamina, strenght and I feel I look firmer.",1385769600,,1000,4.394594594594595
5893946,4,B00E8A0P80,"10 Minute Solution Butt Lift with Christine Bullock includes 5 10-minute workouts with a bonus 10-minute ab workout.  The instructor is adorable and her enthusiasm is contagious.  She makes you want to follow along even when it may be a bit more difficult than you would think.  Who knew 10-minutes could work so many muscle groups?  But I didn't wake up the next day unable to walk so I was still able to function.

These 10 Minute Solution DVDs are great because they have a menu that allows you to pick and choose your workout.  You can start with abs, do a workout with a lot of squats, and move to a cardio workout for a full 30 minutes of exercise or you can just do 10 minutes or do a whole hour.  You have control over what you do when and thats wonderful.  My only complaint is that the instructor doesnt offer modifications immediately.  Each exercise is typically done for 45 seconds and one leg will be worked through a series before moving to the other leg but the modifications come after a few too many repetitions for me.

Nonetheless, I think the workouts are the perfect level of challenging.  Yes, some of the workouts were too difficult for me to do but I have a balance disorder so I don't expect to be able to do all of the exercises on a DVD like this.  Plus, I have faith that the stronger I get, the more easily Ill move through even the workouts I cannot do now.

So if you like your instructors on the perky side, enjoy a challenging and focused workout, and also like to have the power to choose your routine, this DVD is a brilliant choice.",1385683200,,1569,4.332191780821918
5893947,3,B00E8A0P80,"This workout was a little hi-impact for me.  I was looking for something to do indoors this winter to replace the 2-mile walk I take outside every day.  Though these are 10-minute workouts, they were a bit tough for a 70-year-old.  However, there are a lot of positive things to be said.  They would be fine for a younger person wanting to keep in shape.  I used to be young and these would have been quite doable in previous decades.  There is enough variety not to get bored, which is always a down side to videos on tape or DVD.  Overall, I would recommend this as a pretty good workout video for someone already working on their fitness; but a bit difficult for a beginner, and a bit more difficult for a senior citizen even if they are working on staying fit.",1385510400,12,764,4.338028169014085
5893948,5,B00E8A0P80,"I really like the concept of a 10-minute focused workout because its just not scary. I mean, I can do ten minutes, right? Its not like I have to get dressed or drag out equipment and move furniture and then commit to 45 minutes or an hour. And I figure that one short workout that I *will* do is much better than a longer one that I will avoid doing.

I tried Upright Booty because its a standing workout and I really do not have very much room in my house to work out. The good news is that none of the workouts on the DVD really require much space and they don't require any special equipment.
There are five separate 10-minute workouts, Cardio Booty Camp, Butt Lift, Upright Booty, Butt and Thighs, and Hiit Butt Lift. A bonus workout is Amazing Abs, which includes standing and floor moves.

The workouts look simple but they deliver. I found that I could not keep up with Christine Bullock, so when she did 10 repetitions I probably did 4 or 5, but the next day I felt that I had done some work. So the plus here is that you don't have to keep up with the trainer in order to get something from the DVD. As long as you put some effort into the workout you can benefit, and then work on increasing your speed and repetitions as you learn the moves.

The background music has a lively beat but isn't obnoxiously loud. Other reviewers have complained about the set but for the most part its Christine doing the exercises on a mat with a brick wall, some dumbbells, and Swiss balls in the background. To the left is a frosted-glass wall with exercise machines behind it, so it just looks like a gym. I didn't find the set to be distracting or ugly.

Choosing the workouts from the main DVD menu is easy; you can click on them with your remote and add up to seven routines to your workout, which means that you can repeat a routine if you like. Theres also an option to play all routines.

As I was writing my review, I decided to pop the DVD into my computer and see if it would play. Well, it does  and I can select the routines with my mouse. Now I can keep the DVD by my desk and do one of the workouts whenever I want.",1385164800,,2123,4.1658536585365855

Better news: These are excellent 10 minute workouts.

Sad news: You can not regain former levels of glorious fitness by devoting 10 minutes a day to working out.

I thought the first one, just called 'Butt Lift' would be easiest, but it was not - I was sore in my legs for about three days after that ONE ten minute segment, and that afternoon my knee hurt and I had to baby it the rest of the day, so older & out of shape exercisers, be careful!  The ballet and Pilates inspired workout was actually the easiest, but it still made me feel like I was getting something accomplished.

I liked the presenter, mostly, and this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, she does say a few dumb things and I wished I could turn the sound off sometimes.  But overall it was not too bad.

The instructor has a very chatty style and is very concerned about how we will look in a bikini. I mostly wanted to shape up to strengthen my body not show it off. So maybe this workout will appeal to people in their 20s. It seems that is what most workouts are made for these days.

Some of the moves also require a lot of balance so I'd say this workout is more for those who are intermediate. Beginners are going to find it difficult to keep up.

The only thing that annoys me about these 10 Minute Solution workouts is some of the set. There is some frosted glass on the left side of the room that makes things look blurry on my TV. And I don't understand the appeal of the chalkboard. It makes things look messy. This workout also has a short ab workout. I did all six segments at once and survived. But you can mix and match.

10 MINUTE SOLUTION: BUTT LIFT features instructor Christine Bullock, who incorporates her backgrounds in Pilates, yoga, and barre into the different workouts.  As with all the DVDs in the 10 Minute Solution series, there are five 10-minute routines, but this video also offers a bonus sixth workout.  Other than supportive footwear (and an optional mat for floorwork), no equipment is required.  Except where noted, Bullock performs five total exercises in each workout, doing each move for 45 seconds/2 sets.  I have provided additional details below.

BUTT LIFT
This first segment is a toning workout designed to target the glutes and hamstrings from different angles and incorporating both floor and standing work.  The five moves are as follows:  1) around the world lunge, 2) kneeling (all fours) kicks, 3) frog (prone) lifts, 4) single leg bridge, and 5) lunge lifts (crescent pose into kicks).  Bullock ends with brief standing hamstring and glutes stretches.

CARDIO BOOTY CAMP
During this cardio segment--which includes some higher impact moves--Bullock talks A LOT about things like fitting into your bikini and ""skinny jeans.""  She briefly performs ""butt kicks"" (jogging) as a warm-up and then moves into the following five exercises:  1) warrior lunge (touching the floor), 2) side step lunge (with side kick), 3) plank jacks (adding rear leg lift), 4) tap jacks, and 5) lunge kick.  A quick thigh stretch concludes this workout.

UPRIGHT BOOTY
As the name suggests, this entire section--which also focuses on toning--is performed standing.  The exercises are performed all on one side first, and then Bullock repeats the sequence on the second side.  Many of the movements add a rotational element to also work the waist.  The exercises are as follows:  1) staggered squat twist, 2) Charlie's Angel lunge (with side rotation), 3) circle squat, 4) side lunge crunch, and 5) curtsey kicks (a standing split variation).  There is a quick stretch to finish this routine.

BUTT & THIGHS
Bullock states that these are some of her favorite ballet and Pilates moves; this workout includes both standing and floor exercises.  The sequence is as follows:  1) side lunge crossover, 2) thigh fall (kneeling--similar to back dancing), 3) kneeling side kicks (from Pilates), 4) pretzel kick (actually a lift), and 5) single leg circle (standing).  Bullock concludes with quad and side stretches.

HIIT BUTT LIFT
The format is a bit different for this segment, as there are eight total moves.  In the style of high intensity interval training, Bullock performs each move for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest (the rest period is always a held squat).  After the brief warm-up (jumping rope), here are the moves included in this section:  1) lateral plyo squat, 2) scissor jump lunge, 3) power pli, 4) round off lunge, 5) Burpee lunge, 6) side hop squat, 7) knee skips, and 8) cross country squat.  The workout concludes with a hamstring stretch and runner's lunge.

AMAZING ABS
This bonus segment again returns to the doing two sets of five exercises for 45 seconds each.  The five included moves are as follows:  1) knee lift/oblique knee lift, 2) alternating pass plank, 3) teaser kick, 4) attitude crunch, and 5) ""the stack up"" (crunch with one foot resting on other, bringing knees in).  Between sets, Bullock performs a 10-second bridge, and she finishes the routine with a quick cobra and child's pose.

With their younger instructors, newer fitness trends (e.g., HIIT training), and higher impact moves, the latest DVDs in the 10 Minute Solution series (including this one and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-High-Intensity-Interval-Training/dp/B00DLX761E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: High Intensity Interval Training</a>) seem aimed at a younger, fitter audience.  Throughout the routines in Butt Lift, instructor Christine Bullock offers modifications here and there, but not many, and she moves along at a brisk pace.  Experienced exercisers looking for something new and a bit different are likely to enjoy this DVD, but beginners (or anyone with limitations due to impact, flexibility, etc.) are apt to feel somewhat left behind.",1383696000,3,4391,5.3313953488372094
5893962,5,B00E8A0P80,"Whoa! Just got doing the workout this morning. I did all 5 segments, plus the bonus ab workout. I'm a pretty tough girl, but this workout still killed me. You get very little breaks, which keeps your heart rate up. This DVD isn't just about the booty. You'll burn fat and get in some great cardio conditioning at the same time. 5 stars for sure.",1383523200,,345,4.323076923076923
5893963,4,B00E8A0P80,"As noted in previous reviews, there are five workouts each 10 minutes long which are designed to work your glutes from every angle. And because everything is connected your core and legs get a good workout too. There is also a bonus 10 minute Abs workout.

This is a collection of intense (and sweaty) workouts. I completed four of the butt workouts my first time through and I was sore for the next three days (especially deep in the glutes around the sit bones)! Cardio Booty Camp and the HIIT Butt Lift workouts had me puffing and my heart pounding as it really gives a good cardio workout as well.

My only concern is because of the 10 minute format, the moves are done pretty quickly. This is fine for some moves, but for lunges or squats for example, the quick moves may mean you are working too hard to keep up with the instructor and not focussed enough on proper form and could therefore hurt your knees. In one of the workouts - Christine has you do ""around the world lunges"" where you lunge forward, then lunge at a diagonal and then lunge back. She moves quickly which can be tricky as these moves require balance (remember to brace that core!) so I pause the DVD and go at my own pace until I am better at that sequence of moves.

I suggest doing a more thorough stretch (especially for your glutes) after the workout as the format does not allow for sufficient stretching. I googled glute stretches for ideas. It's definitely no fun having a very tight butt (no pun intended) from working out daily but with minimal stretching!

Christine the instructor has a pleasant engaging personality and explains the moves well. No screechy accent or grating voice here.

The workout is fun (the moves varied and interesting - some I haven't seen before) and will definitely kick your butt before your butt gets lifted.",1383436800,6,1823,4.562691131498471
