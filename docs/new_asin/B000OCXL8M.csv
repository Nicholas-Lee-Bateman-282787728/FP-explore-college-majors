8184550,5,B000OCXL8M,"After Rin's servant is defeated, only Shirou, Saber, and Rin are able to fight Berserker. They take the fight to him and are being terribly defeated. Rin is able to destroy his head. After seemingly killing him, he regenerates. The truth is that Berserker has 12 lives. In a desperate attempt, Shirou is able to create a replica of Excaliber. Saber and Shirou are able to destroy their enemy. Now a defeated Ilia has come to live with them as well. This series is just a breath away from being a harem anime lol. Even though the strongest servant is dead, more enemies remain.

This is an excellent volume. The animation and voice acting are better than ever. The action, drama and comedy are also the best the series has had so far. The fight with Berserker is intense and the true identity of Saber is not a surprise, but cool nonetheless. I really like volume 4. This series keeps getting better and better all the time.",1354665600,,923,4.526946107784431

8184552,5,B000OCXL8M,"Archer battles Beserker using all his awsome abilities, again and again Beserker rises from searing explosions and fountains of blood, each time Archer gets more beaten,blooder and weaker from Beserker's sledgehammer blows. As they fight Archer chants;

I am the bone of my sword
Steel is my body,and fire is my blood
I have created over a thousand blades
Unknown to Death
Nor known to Life
The mind bores through the Mountain
The sword divides the River
Have withstood pain to create many weapons
Yet, those hands will never hold anything
So as I Pray, UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS

In a roar of flame the castle disapears and they find themselves on a endless blasted plain.
Uncountable swords of every discription are stuck in the ground all around like gravemarkers streaching off into the distance.
A fog of smoke floats by and sparks drift down like snowflakes.
Overhead in the sullen, overcast sky, gigantic rusty gears turn painfully.
This is Archer's final stand.",1264982400,,965,4.950617283950617
