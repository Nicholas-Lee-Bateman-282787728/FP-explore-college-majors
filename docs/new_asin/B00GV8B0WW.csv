6119782,5,B00GV8B0WW,"Not only is this movie super funny, it's an authentic look into a world you don't normally see in movies, particularly comedies: the working class American South. These guys may be rednecks, but they're not cartoon characters. They have real problems, real personalities, and sharp, funny dialogue to back it all up. Oh, and if you're a fan of country music, then AWM has what you need. Check out an acoustic performance from Mary Birdsong (Reno 911!) that's surprisingly heartfelt, especially considering some of the wild, raunchy stuff in this movie. All in all, a Southern fried good time.",1401235200,,592,4.98989898989899
