8524192,4,B00826CB60,"Andy Milligan does Sweeney Todd in yet another of his London based movies he made for the ""gentleman film goer's cluibs."" It's a bit like a dirty version of a PBS masterpiece theater production but more fun. More importantly, it's got all the important familiar Milligan touch stones like characters missing from frame, evil families, homosexual men trying their hardest not to be repulsed by the actress they are having to kiss, and questionable costuming. It all gets ramped up even higher here. You get a conversation where the camera has unfortunately zoomed in between the actors leaving neither of them in frame except an occasional chin and nose. The family here is even nastier than before. Milligan's mother hate is on such a high level here that the second one woman declares pregnancy you know she's going to go even crazier. Oh and of course the obvious 70s decor and cars being reflected in windows of what is supposed to be Victorian London.

It's not the best Milligan but it's still good fun for his fans. If you're into those bad movie night type experiences, it's also a solid choice. It's quick and has just enough craziness to keep you entertained when you aren't talking to a friend.",1502928000,,1204,4.760765550239235
8524193,5,B00826CB60,"Andy Milligan is in a directorial class almost of his own -- Ed Wood is in the same category, as are Herschel GordonLewis, and Doris Wischman.  This movie, like all Milligan creations, has hand-held 16mm cameras, film ""ends"" that result in multiple splices and dropped frames. off-kilter angles, canned public domain music, laughable dialogue.  It is a triumph of cheesy low-budget schlock filmmaking by a master of the oeuvre.  In other words, it is so crummy that it's really fun to watch!!",1418947200,2,492,4.975609756097561
8524194,2,B00826CB60,"Bad camera work. Bad writing. Little blood. Really hard to follow. If i didn't know Sweeney Todd as well as i do, I would not like this movie. But seeing as i know quite a bit its good in its own weird way.",1410912000,,206,3.813953488372093
