For decades I wondered if the James Brown performance of ""Mother Popcorn"" would ever make the video market. I found ""Volume Six"" in an unlikely place in a likely place - a video store at the Mall - and quickly pointed myself in the direction of the cashier, so as to expedite my lousy 40 minute ride home to watch a rendition I remembered as amazing. The call-and-response ""chase"" between James and Maceo Parker was and is worth the price of admission. It's a segment worthy of inclusion on more than a few rockumentaries. I didn't recall any of the other performers' bits, but the Everlys' ""Medley"" and bonus track (""Walk Right Back"") are also immensely entertaining. Dusty Springfield's contribution is also worthy of note. On the middle-of-the-road side Tony Bennett does his thing nicely with ""I Gotta Be Be"" and ""Smile"". A highly recommended set. I wish other similiar TV shows from that period would also release high quality videocassettes.",970272000,,1086,4.907608695652174
