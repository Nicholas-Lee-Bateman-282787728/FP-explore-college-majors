8032619,5,B0002V7NUM,No one makes documentaries in such a superior research manner or beautiful presentation as A&E does.  I consider these biographies as my most prescious and invaluable DVD's.  Can't wait to see what's next!,1125705600,7,205,5.181818181818182
8032620,5,B0002V7NUM,"I purchased this video at the Lincoln Memorial gift shop in Washington, DC...so, evidently I'm not alone in recommending this fine, compact biography.  There are many Brady (or Brady-esque) photographs that I had never seen before, Some splendid drawings and political cartoons of the era, great narrations of Lincoln's writings; and, some uncharacteristically lively interviews with historians representing many different points of view on the great man.  Like the previous reviewer, I found this to be an unusually engaging A&E.  It made me laugh out loud at times, tear up with sympathy, and catch my breath in astonishment.  Very worth anyone's time and a great instruction aid for home school or any teacher.",1115424000,17,713,5.283185840707965
