6681535,5,B00NW6KQE4,The anime is really good but some of the voice actors don't really go with the characters but overall the voice acting is decent.,1422316800,,129,4.416666666666667
6681536,5,B00NW6KQE4,This is one of my wife's favorites and I really enjoy it too. It is really funny and I'm really excited it's finally in English cause that's the only reason we haven't bought it yet.,1421884800,3,182,4.228571428571429
6681537,5,B00NW6KQE4,"Spoiler: Well, not really. You know it's coming, as in all of these. There's a love confession.

Even as a sub, I bawled like a baby. She can't look at him while doing it, and while she keeps holding him so he can't leave, you can tell he's so shocked, he couldn't leave even if he wanted.

I must've played that scene over and over a dozen times. While it's an over the top comedy, I didn't expect to see that touching and romantic confession, and it just broke this mean, cranky 51-year-old jaded anime veteran like a teenage fan girl. I couldn't face my wife for an hour afterward, and I still can't describe it to other people without tearing up. Gah!

Buy it. Trust me. Get the subbed version, with the original vocal pacing. Good lord, I'll still be bawling over this if I watch this again in another 10 years. I'm at 1,200 DVD's, not counting the one's I own that are digital copies only. I don't do a lot of reviews, so, rent, buy, borrow this one from someone. It's well worth owning.",1414281600,16,993,4.2994652406417115

6681582,2,B00NW6KQE4,"In many anime series the main character is an average boy who gets surrounded and proposed by beautiful girls full of great qualities. Why? Usually just because of awesome good luck. However, Maid-Sama (MS) is a series aimed at girls (shoujo), therefore its main character is a girl, Mizaki Ayuzawa, and it deals with female dreams and desires, which are pretty much the same as its male equivalents.

Plenty of anime content aims at our deepest dreams and desires that we can't confess to anybody. Most people may deny this but at some level we both straight men & women- dream of being admired and sought after by beautiful people of the opposite sex. MS is all about pleasing these hidden dreams..in women. In addition to physical beauty we both also would like these prospect partners to be of high social class, rich, intelligent, ethical, etc. At least one of Mizakis friend makes the case crystal clear, Sakura Hanazono.

I have to admit that Mizaki is a far better central character that the male one in many anime shows, again an usually average guy, sometimes plain repulsive, like Rito in To Love Ru. Mizaki is a girl of very high standards in her studies, her physical health and personal integrity, yet her excessive efforts keep her from being a role model. Many American women may well identify with her in their own quest for perfection and success, which is actually greed, fully encouraged (or pressed) by our culture.

Mizaki hates men for the most part. The show itself sides with her by portraying most guys in plain discriminatory ways. Men are mostly portrayed in MS as primitive, abusive against women, dumb, unprincipled or just weak. Curiously MS attempts to deal with the opposite case, male hate against women by presenting Soutarou Kanou, a guy who suffered an equivalent experience to Mizaki, being abandoned by a parent of the opposite sex. Soutarou claims he hates women because of their weakness, which Mizaki proves him wrong and heals him from his hate. Hating people because of their weakness sounds odd, but it does happen and maybe frequently. The problem is that MS miserably failed at trying to understand men's hate for women, which can be a long story, but quite often is because of equivalent's reasons as women hate men. For example, we are also treated like objects as much as women do, mostly as money-making machines. The best we get is a credit or a chance not to make money due to unemployment or being a student, but we are well expected to be the bread winners, sooner or later, the sooner the much better.

Its great that some anime series deal with female hatred against men more often and in more open ways that American entertainment, but MS supports that hatred stance. In this regard MS is disgustingly similar to plenty of Western shows. In this American sense MS also follows a positive trend against racism in one chapter when they visit a dark skinned friends relative, Nagisa Hyoudou. Mizakis coworkers get sort of nervous with her.

 Japanese frequently are racist, but Mizaki accepts Nagisa and leads her coworkers into accepting her as well. A positive trend that fails again when the show discriminates Japanese people from Kobe, especially their accent presented as primitive with Tora Igarashi. Well, Nagisa's chapter is the only one with a bit of fanservice,nothing big but people with mental issues against the human body will still struggle here and may have kept MS from being available in any American college.

MS is fairly comic or quite indeed if you hate men. Its main value comes from its vivid displays of the human nature and desires, which don't care one damn about cultures, a popular and overrated topic from our times. It falls down with its bias against men and it doesnt show negative female characters to counter all the bad rep it gives to  men. In fact it doesn't show negative examples only from the show's perspective where Sakura is totally OK valuing men for their looks, money and social status.",1450656000,2,3989,4.80466472303207

6681612,5,B00NW6KQE4,"Hearing it in English was a bit weird at first, mostly because I'm used to the Japanese version, but after a couple of episodes you forget about that and realize how awesome it is.
And really it IS awesome, perfect for anyone who wants romance and adventure and a lot of hilarity. . . There are some serious situations dealt with here, but it never becomes too dark, it doesn't lose sight of what makes it so enjoyable.",1436745600,,419,4.384615384615385

There is still mystery to the backgrounds of the main characters and I don't like the rival competition for affection of the heroine, but I have watched this twice and will watch it again.

6681629,4,B00NW6KQE4,"This was a rare purchase for me, I normally don't buy Shojo series, but I bought the series on DVD sub only and enjoyed it. I was thrilled when the DUB came out on Blu-Ray no less! I just loved Monica Rial's Voice acting! Sentai film works was wise to go back and dub this one in English. I highly recommend Maid Sama to anyone who tends to stick to Shonen series and wants a change of pace!",1431907200,,391,4.0256410256410255

6681631,5,B00NW6KQE4,An extremely funny anime. The budding relationship between the main two characters is so much fun to watch. I find that the show in English is so much better than reading script. This anime lays the foundation of their love for each other although one has such a hard time coming to grips with the man that she loves. One of the top anime's in my library.,1429833600,14,355,4.313432835820896
6681632,5,B00NW6KQE4,"Maid-sama is a great anime with little to no fan service. It is very comedic with some nice romantic elements. The only cons to this series are the filler episodes and abrupt ending. The ending wasn't bad by any means, but it left much to be desired. The show is charming and has great characters. I would recommend purchasing it after you have either rented it or viewed it some other way.",1427414400,,390,4.430555555555555
6681633,5,B00NW6KQE4,"I personally love this anime, Sentai Film works does a great job with both sub and dub. All around it is a fantastic, very funny and light hearted. Very family friendly and a good watch for anyone who likes anime.",1425945600,,213,4.35

6681635,4,B00NW6KQE4,"Love the story and was happy to get it. I wrote a really mean post when I got this and it didn't work on my region free blu ray player, and I would like to apologize for that. It seems that my player was simply out of date and the sad thing is they don't update the one I have anymore. Sorry for any problems I might have caused.",1425254400,,329,3.782608695652174
6681636,5,B00NW6KQE4,"im a guy and i rarely fell in love with shoujo animes and its one of the best animes i ever saw
is really funny anime
Usui is hilarious guy and he loves this girl name misaki but Misaki hates boys!!
the best thing about this anime is has no fan services
the Japanese voices is great as always",1423872000,5,292,3.9661016949152543
6681637,5,B00NW6KQE4,"I honestly love this anime! It's one of the best romcoms you will see! However the dub is garbage. Maybe its because I watched the sub version a while back and fell in love, but when I watched this dubbed version I was totally disappointed. The main girls voice is a complete turn off to the series. She is supposed to be a tomboy but she isn't Marcie from Charlie brown. Also her childhood friend is from the country but they make him sound like he is straight out of south Georgia. If you haven't seen the subbed version than you might like this one just fine but I really feel like they did a great anime a disservice.

Anyway this is a beautiful romance story with characters that grow over time and have genuine feelings for each other. The story is typical of a first love where you take things slow and try to figure one another out. Its funny and heartwarming at times and you really want everything to work out for everyone. Voice aside, the main girl is a strong and outspoken girl which is a nice difference from most timid girl characters (think Say I Love You). The main guy is sweet and awesome! The anime is 24 (+) episodes and worth every penny.",1423180800,4,1161,4.325688073394495
