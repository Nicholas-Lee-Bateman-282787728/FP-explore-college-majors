4460828,3,B004RIACU4,"Christopher Isherwood apparently knew what he was doing when he destroyed his Berlin diaries and published his Berlin Stories instead. They later on turned into the play I Am a Camera and, ultimately, Cabaret. He returned to his real adventures in the 1970s but the book seems addressed rather to those who can't get enough of his fiction and are begging for more than the general public. Which does not mean it is a bad book, quite on the contrary, Isherwood was far too good a writer to do any such thing as to publish a bad book.
Christopher and His Kind is very little more than a footnote to Cabaret addressed to those who want more of the same thing. Unfortunately, they are bound to be disappointed. This is a typical biopic in which Ireland pretends to be Berlin in the early 1930s, acting is so so, and the plot rather disappointing and bland. The movie chooses the early part of Isherwood's memoir and one can hardly wonder why - the costs. Isherwood's attempts at saving his Heinz took him to the Netherlands, Sweden and Portugal. It would probably be quite difficult to get it all in Ireland at a reasonable price so all we get is Berlin, mostly interiors. When Auden informs Isherwood that he decided to show him a gay club instead of the Brandenburg Gate, you get a fair warning, you won't see the Gate in this movie. You won't see too much of gay life either. As a result there is little drama here and not much of a plot - when the things get real rough we don't get to see them only to be informed of what happened in a rather short scene.
The movie can be quite touching at times but it fails to convince in the longer run. We can neither learn of the drama of Isherwood's life (just a glimps of his life-long conflict with his widowed mother) nor why he actually became a famous writer (not due to sleeping with Berlin boys which is presented in a rather unconvincing manner). In short - if you're interested in Isherwood, get the book and read it, you won't regret it. As for the movie - don't rush buying the DVD. At least wait until it is discounted.",1301788800,27,2072,4.370466321243524
4460829,5,B004RIACU4,"Matt Smith turns in a fearless portrayal of author Christopher Isherwood. This film is splendid and beautiful as writer Kevin Elyot and director Geoffrey Sax bring to life Isherwood's vision of Berlin, its boys, the cabarets and the downfall under Hitler's Nazi regime.

4460842,5,B004RIACU4,"After watching this autobiographical film about British writer Christopher Isherwood, I once again was convinced of the multifaceted talent of the actor Matt Smith. In my opinion, Matt Smith comprehensively gifted actor. He is able to play a comic or dramatic role. Now a little about the movie itself. This film is based on the memoirs of Christopher, who for some time lived in Germany. With it, we see the Nazis came to power. It was sheer obscurantism. With it, we experience the betrayal of his lover. I just want to note the emergence of very colorful characters in the house where the writer lived. Each of these tenants has made a living as best they could. And each of them had his dream and hope. It was all ruined. After some time the writer Christopher met his long-awaited love. But as time has shown, this love brought him only sorrow and worries.",1439337600,,861,4.633986928104576

4460850,5,B004RIACU4,"I avoided viewing this film for a long time, assuming it was all ""gay"" and no story.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is a masterful, dramatized account of the author Christopher Isherwood's early adult years as a British ex-pat in Berlin.  As a gay man, he delights in the relative sexual freedom afforded by Berlin at the time while also encountering the frightening ascent of the Nazis to power in Germany.",1410566400,,401,4.619718309859155
4460851,4,B004RIACU4,"From the setting of the movie, you don't need to be a historian (or a Time Lord?) to figure out that the rise of Nazism will play a bit of a factor in this story. And it's not just a small bit either, and different characters seem to challenge Christopher with their different views on Nazism. But more than that, there's also the pressure for Christopher to take a more active stance on the whole thing as well - something he's rather reluctant to get into since he claims to be more focused on his art as a writer.

Caspar is but one of Christopher's relationships and the movie makes sure to show the different people that come into his life. And in this regard I'm a little on the fence about Matt Smith's portrayal of this LGBT character. Maybe my difficult was due to the fact that I know him more as his character on Doctor Who, and thus it's a little harder to see him in any other context. Or maybe it also has to do with the fact that Matt Smith sort of only acts in one way that one can't quite distinguish between the Doctor and Christopher.

The movie does have a lot of lovely camera work as part of the larger effort to recreate the feel of 1930's Berlin. And given how interesting the boarding house is a location plus other venues like the Cosy Corner, and the movie certainly had a nice range to present to viewers. And in the greater scheme of things seeing this world from Christopher's perspective was quite the interesting experience.

Christopher and His Kind is a little heavy and one needs to focus in order to fully appreciate things. I suspect that folks who weren't familiar with Doctor Who probably had a much easier time with immersing themselves in this movie experience - so good for you guys.",1410393600,,1725,4.401253918495298

4460856,4,B004RIACU4,"This is the story of writer Christopher Isherwood's indulgence in the gay mecca of Berlin in those last days before Hitler.  Isherwood's original narratives were greatly restricted and symbolic when first published as he could not be explicit and frank in those days.  At a later period he finally rewrote the stories more literally.  It's an honest story, Isherwood is there to sample a lifestyle not possible in most places in those days, but there is the honest declaration that he ignored the dark forces rising at the time.  He used the place and the time to immerse himself in boys and ignored the moral questions raised by the rise of Nazism.",1402704000,3,649,4.767857142857143

4460867,3,B004RIACU4,"I see that a lot of viewers have given this film very high marks. I respect that. I can't agree, however. For me, Isherwood came across as something of a cardboard character in the film, very selfish and not even very interesting. His lover, Heinz, while beautiful, also was a bit one-dimensional. When the film has Isherwood leaving Heinz at the immigration office and then later rejecting an opportunity to live with him again, then ending with the words onscreen that Heinz was shocked by Isherwood's book and never communicated with him again... wow. Isherwood just comes off as selfish and heartless and Heinz as a prude. The truth is Isherwood spent four years traveling with Heinz from country to country after his visa to stay in England was denied. They only parted after Heinz was arrested and sent to prison (and even then Isherwood paid for an excellent attorney who helped keep Heinz out of a concentration camp and receive a relatively light sentence). Too, Heinz did sent Isherwood a note following his mother's death, so they did stay in touch. Not sure if Isherwood ever rejected Heinz attempt at living together again or if that is just made up. All I can think of is the producers wanted to save money. The film is shot in Northern Ireland, and perhaps they just didn't have the budget to portray the two men traveling for four years in an attempt to stay a couple. My only thought is perhaps they shouldn't have made the film if they couldn't do the men justice. The result personally left me cold, although I see this is not a universal reaction.",1381708800,5,1567,4.6606498194945845

My favourite supporting character is Christopher's mother. Her conversations are simply hilarious even though they are all delivered with stiff upper lips. I also get to indulge my guilty pleasure of admiring all the gorgeous, good looking actors who signed up for this amazing gem of a movie.

4460870,5,B004RIACU4,"I waited for some time to buy this film. I'm the kind of person who likes to read the book before seeing the film. Unfortunately, work obligations kept be from getting through more than half the book, so I finally relented and bought the DVD. I'm so glad I did!

First of all, I really like Matt Smith and want to see him perform in other projects besides Doctor Who. I got to do both in this film. He's on the screen almost all the time, and I really enjoyed his performance.

Some reviewers have commented on his performance being wooden or stiff at times. I can see why they would say that, but I saw it as a studied part of the performance in those scenes, not a poor performance on his part at all.

I've also seen where lots of people have asked if Smith is gay after just seeing stills from this film. Come on guys! It's called ""acting."" If he seems convincing, it's because he's a talented actor. There are gay actors who convincingly portray straight characters, too. If actors know what they're doing, they can do a great job in the characters they choose.

So, overall, I really enjoyed the film and Smith's performance in it. I buy DVD's only of films I know I'm going to watch more than once, and this one is included.",1379808000,,1231,4.316017316017316
4460871,5,B004RIACU4,"I saw this film and it really gave me a niche about Christopher Isherwood's early years. The performances, dialogue and casting are very enjoyable.  I really liked the sarcastic dialogue between Lindsay Duncan as the mother and Matt Smith as Isherwood as well as the origin of the ""Sally Bowles""(Imogen Poots) from ""I am a Camera/Cabaret"".  The other eccentric characters are fun to watch and  Douglas Booth literally shines beautifully as Isherwood's German boyfriend.

Since I am by no means knowledgeable about Christopher Isherwood's real life as well as his literary canon, I can't validate fact from fiction in this film.

However, I do recommend it for anyone interested about the early 1930s Berlin period as the Nazi regime was coming to power as well as the fleeting glimpse of the underground Berlin gay culture.",1375056000,,823,5.066666666666666

4460882,3,B004RIACU4,"Well, it wasn't what I expected.  From the reviews listed,  I thought it might a deep look at a man's life as he escaped pre-war England to a more tolerant Europe.  ""Buggery"" is what the English called homosexuality during the first part of the 20th century. In the 30's it was punishable by inprisonment or death.  Isherwood made it plain why he was going to Germany and once he was there a friend introduced him to the underground homosexual culture.  He acted like a child in a candy store, but was informed that the men in his candy store were mostly heterosexual. They were trying to keep themselves and their families fed by prostituting themselves.  He was naive and it was a rude awakening.  Without the one frontal nudity scene and Matt Smith making love to a man, this film could have been shown on Masterpiece Theater.
I'm not saying I didn't like the movie.  I always try to find out more about an actor if he or she shows up on a show I like and I am a die-hard ""Doctor Who"" fan.  Matt Smith is a wonderful actor and he did a fantastic job as Isherwood and there was very little of his ""Doctor Who"" persona in the performance.  He will never be type-cast as ""Doctor Who"" as long as he continues to make films that are so different.  The big problem was the writing.  They could have given him so much more to work with.  It was different than ""Doctor Who"", but it was not a ""stretch"" for him.  I've seen episodes of ""Doctor Who"" that have made him dig deeper.
The other actors and actresses gave passing performances.

I really disappointed if this is true. I watched the original on the BBC; there's no reason to tone material this down.

However, that said, this film is a brilliant production. The cinematography is top drawer, and the acting too (especially that of Matt Smith, Imogene Poots and Toby Jones)...

This movie is based on a book:  http://www.amazon.com/Christopher-His-Kind-Isherwood/dp/0816638632

It's not fiction (though I am sure there was plenty of adaptations, as there always are when bios are adapted to films).

This story about pre-war Berlin, Jean Rose, the girl Isherwood makes friends with (and who he eventually writes about and later becomes the model for the famous Caberet play), and Gerald Hamilton, the man on the train (a real cheeky performance from Toby Jones); is all fascinating stuff.

I also loved the realistic way that gay life is portrayed in this film.

It's fanatic story, about a real person who lived a very interesting life, and should not missed!",1351728000,,1076,5.068181818181818
4460885,3,B004RIACU4,"I found this movie curiously ""flat"" considering the immense social upheaval that was taking place in the time it is set.
Isherwood is presented as a most unsympathetic character. Matt Smith the actor uses a weird ""British"" upper-class accent that makes him appear something of a vapid in-bred self-indulgent prat.
 Now this of course may be accurate but in the movie it becomes a bit irritating in that he is curiously unresponsive to the serious and menacing world unfolding about him. His close friend Auden(Pip Carter) is a very one-dimensional representation, seeming constantly depressed, ...although we are told he is suffering an anal fissure and unrequited love for Isherwood, which together just may account for his morose,unhappy nature.

The Sally Bowles inspiration(Jean Ross here),is well portrayed. Thankfully the film uses an actress (Imogen Poots) who CANNOT sing. The whole point of her self-delusion is that she really has minimal talent. Too often she is played by a competent singer, which defeats the very irony of her story.
Isherwood's first ""gay"" friend he meets on the train is played very well by Toby Jones as something of a sad, ageing drifter, trying to hang onto the last vestiges of his youth, (and his wig!), eke out a living by various schemes, while taking advantage of the compliant, but sometimes dangerous rentboys in Berlin.
Other characters are not so well developed, although the land lady (Issy Van Randwyck) and Isherwood's mother (Lindsay Duncan) both turn in very creditable performances.

I found his last ""lover/rentboy"" Heinz played by Douglas Booth somewhat overly pretty and curiously un-aged or affected when he returns from what was apparently two years hard labour and a year in the army. The only addition of a very unconvincing stage moustache does little to convey any effect of harsh treatment or time having passed. With his porcelain-like totally unlined skin and glowing eyes, he looks like he's just returned from a week in some expensive spa rather than being harshly treated by the Nazis.
He's also miraculously turned straight, married and had children in the meantime, ....and not aged a single moment.

It's Ireland for Berlin I'm afraid, so neither the architecture, (nor the trains for you buffs), look right and there's little atmosphere of the famous Berlin cabarets and their pre-Nazi political satire suggested. We just see ""Sally"" singing badly.

There is a large amount of time devoted to the homo-erotic denizens of ""The Cosy Corner"", ....a subterranean gay bar that appears to be in a converted sewer.
Isherwood's pickups and dealings with these willing, and apparently straight, but competent opportunists makes up the first half of the movie. He's of course ""lookin' fer lurve"", ...despite the fact he came to Berlin ""for the boys"", ...while they are just seeking a few marks for a meal, earned in the easiest way open to them.
Strangely unaware for an astute observer as Isherwood is purported to have been.

Yes, there are a few scenes of homosexual love-making if that's the work of the devil for you, .....one in particular very vigorous, ....AND VERY NOISY!
There's also a glimpse or two of male genitalia if that will unsettle civilization as we know it for you, ...so I have warned you.

In all it's interesting to observe the formation of the observations that will later become ""Cabaret"", .....but as mentioned above there is not a lot made of the ominous rise of Nazism's affect on Isherwood. Yes, he's a bit concerned about his immediate partner, but overall it's more of a nuisance and a bothersome interruption to his sexual exploits than anything else.

He is literally ""a camera"" in that he claims to observe, but remains totally passive.
 I would say that in this story he doesn't even observe all that well, or that deeply for an author, ...although I will refrain from totally agreeing with the famous remark made after ""I Am a Camera"" was originally released; ....namely ""Me No Leica""!",1349740800,2,3981,5.0196969696969695
4460886,4,B004RIACU4,"It is supposed to be a true story that happened to a young man later remembered or rather recollected by the same man grown quite older, some forty years later. It happens around 1933 in Berlin centering on Hitler's arrival to power.

The young English, aristocratic man from England, Christopher Isherwood, goes to Berlin to meet with the young men available there most of the time for a price. He will let himself roll and rock in this atmosphere though he will be very hostile to the exchange of money that he will always refuse in his mind. That will lead him to confronting one of his regular lovers and that lover will plainly disappear after that confrontation, only to be met against in the brown uniform of the SA though identified as a SS uniform.

He does not understand that in the crisis in Germany in 1933 many young men who had no work chose to make the surviving money they needed by renting their bodies for a short moment to other men, generally older men, for a small amount of money, since they could not rent their bodies to an employer who would make a profit out of it by investing their work in the production of goods. Morally, socially and even physically there is no difference. Christopher does not understand there is no love in that exchange. Nothing but a commercial action of sheer survival.

And the only choice they have if they do not want to go on or to start that ""professional"" activity is to join the SS, the SA, the Nazi Party and make a living by crushing the lives of others, Jews, merchants, gays, or whatever - mind you not whoever - is in the way of their getting rid of as many millions of people possible to make the misery and poverty of the others just one iota better.

He will though find the love he is looking for. But he will not be able to keep him in Great Britain after the arrival of Hitler because a British civil servant will understand the sexual dimension of the attachment and refuse the visa. That will end badly for that young German, Heinz, in the hands of the Gestapo, with one year of forced labor and two years in the army.

That could have been a good though sad end, but the author morbidly goes one step further in his self-accusation. He goes back to Berlin in 1952 and meets the people who have survived Hitler. His landlady, for one, who makes him a present. And of course Heinz who lives in East Berlin though the Wall has not been built yet. Without giving the details of that end, it reveals how deep the uncaring carelessness of Christopher in 1933 has become a selfish nostalgia that turns the uncaring carelessness into a blunt rejection.

The film is well done, shows the atmosphere in Germany in 1933, though rather superficially, but it reveals the extreme egotism of that man who only considered Berlin as a hunting ground and revisits it when the raptor, vulture and predator he has been has found his balance in the evanescent scintillating world of Hollywood.

A sad, very sad vision of these aristocrats who can do what they want, provided they satisfy their desires in a lower social strata than theirs. Oscar Wilde (shown burning in Berlin) did the reverse and could not be accepted: he, a plebeian Irishman, who captured the passion of a young English Lord. Social, aristocratic divide breaking, ethnic and national rebellious crime against at the time Her Majesty's supreme aristocracy. To prison and then banned from proper English society, though the young Lord pays no price, of course not.

We have in this film the reverse situation and it reveals the extreme self-centered blindness of the author at the time of events.

4460887,5,B004RIACU4,"This was a brilliant telling of the Isherwood story. Faithful to the book complete with glimpses of Germany beginning to embrace the Nazi movement. Totally engaging. Matt Smith does an excellent job of portraying Isherwood with complete transparency. One quickly ceases to see Matt Smith portraying Christopher Isherwood and begins to see only Christopher Isherwood. The supporting roles are well cast and well acted as well. The movie makes no attempt to make Isherwood into a hero. He is presented with all of his flaws and warts and failings.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good story, a good book and a good movie. Warning to some of you, nothing blows up and there are no aliens. If you need those to enjoy a movie then you'll be bored by this movie which explores human frailties and relationships instead.",1330646400,4,834,4.8321678321678325
4460888,5,B004RIACU4,"I thought it was an excellent portrayal of Christopher Isherwood and the times. All of the actors were brilliant especially Matt Smith.

4460889,2,B004RIACU4,"The movie is set during WWII, which is my favorite era.  The movie is slow, you always are thinking things are going to get better but Christopher is worthless.

4460890,5,B004RIACU4,"Be warned, this movie is not for those who are easily put off by gay themes/content--so maybe not your grandma's cup of tea, depending on the grandmother in question. That said, it's a very well-done take on Christopher Isherwood's autobiography with 'Doctor Who' star Matt Smith in the not completely sympathetic lead role. The title and the content may initially lead viewers to think that this film is all about the gay underground scene in pre-WWII Berlin. However, the movie's really an examination of the privileged life Isherwood lives, who goes ""slumming"" in Berlin, in contrast to those he lives alongside, for whom options are very limited as the specter of war and dissolution approaches. An excellent film carried by very good performances, led by a leading man willing to allow himself be disliked--strongly recommended.",1327017600,5,833,5.177777777777778

4460892,4,B004RIACU4,"I had heard of Christopher Isherwood but knew very little about him. CHRISTOPHER AND HIS KIND seem to be a good introduction to this remarkable man's life. Plus, everything by the BBC seems top rate and visually stunning. Isherwood is from a wealthy British family and has a very complicated relationship with his mother. He has just published his first novel and is in need of adventure. He decides to travel to pre-war Berlin on the advice of a close friend. We quickly learn that ""his kind"" refers gay men and Berlin has a thriving gay life. The economy is so bad that even straight men are willing to do anything for money.
The story seems seedy and unappealing at this point but it quickly turns into a man's journey for love and fulfillment in a very exciting but dangerous time. The Nazis are coming to power and the dark clouds are filling the skies and life becomes dangerous for Jews and anyone who is ""different"" than the majority.

While watching the movie, I realized that Isherwood's book must be the inspiration for the movie ""CABARET"". His new best friend and neighbor is a singer in a cabaret. I can only imagine the feeling of Berlin in the 1930s as Hitler began his rise to power and Isherwood experienced it all firsthand. How would anyone react to the growing danger? Isherwood was free to leave but what about his German boyfriend?

I'm eager to read the book since clearly there will be more detail. In the film, Isherwood goes back to Berlin after the war to find his former landlady and his lost boyfriend, Heinz. The scenes are touching but don't explain a lot. How did Heinz survive the war?

We know from the beginning of the film that Isherwood eventually settles in Los Angeles and writes his memoirs of the Berlin days. He mentions that the diary he kept had been lost and he was writing from memory of events that happened over 40 years earlier.

The movie does have a rough start with the seedy part of life in Berlin in the 30's but then it becomes a study of love and friendship and of finding oneself.",1318204800,8,2037,4.512195121951219
4460893,2,B004RIACU4,"One way that I gauge the quality of a movie is how quickly I pick up the remote and move towards the stop button. We all know some movies are slow to percolate, characters appear in a confusing order without introduction, plots run parallel and then diverge inexplicably, and then in a few moments, the clouds clear and you ""get"" the director's vision, the purpose for bringing cast and crew and scenes to film. Unfortunately, I had an itchy stop button finger throughout Christopher and His Kind. The main character was so indulgent that I felt a smirk was ready on his lips as soon as the camera panned away. There were rich story lines worth diving into that were introduced to tease the viewer and then quickly placed in the book bonfire lit by the Nazis. I can only conclude that Christopher was not at all like ""His Kind"" - he was rich, spoiled, and self-centered while those around him made sacrifices, committed to people and causes, and struggled to find a meaningful place in life.",1317686400,5,991,4.604519774011299

4460896,5,B004RIACU4,"After his famous ""Berlin Stories"" inspired both the drama ""I Am A Camera"" and the dramatic musical ""Cabaret"", author Christopher Isherwood still did not feel that his life had been accurately depicted on stage and screen. To this end, he published ""Christopher And His Kind"" in 1976. If the earlier play and musical had been, esentially, ""fictionalized autobiography"", then ""Kind"", directed by Geoffrey Sax and written for British TV by Kevin Elyot, wants to be Isherwood's ""true story"".
  Aspiring writer Christopher Isherwood (Matt Smith) quickly goes to Berlin at the invitation of his friend W.H. Auden (Pip Carter). Ireland makes  a surprisingly believeable ""location substitute"" for Berlin in this production. Christopher writes that he went to  1930's Berlin ""for the boys."" He probably went to escape his horribly judgemental and domineering mother (Lindsay Duncan). After a few moments with Duncan on screen, you might want to escape by any means necessary as well.
  During his early months in Berlin, life may well have been a cabaret, filled with gay sex, for young Christopher. ""Kind"" is surprisingly frank and candid about his sex life, far more so than ""Cabaret."" ""Cabaret"" made Christopher bi-sexual;
in love with chanteuse Sally Bowles, and that is probably what bothered him about it. ""Kind"" portrays him as totally homosexual. Christopher gets so much sex here, it seems that sex is his job and teaching English and writing is his hobby; instead of vice-versa. But Berlin also contains terrors far more frightening than the domineering mother Christopher ran away from. At first, Christopher, who famously wrote, ""I am a camera with its shutter open"" views the Nazi uprising rather passively. But how can you remain a passive observer when the Nazis, who killed both Jewish people and homosexuals, come to power? There is a frightening scene of the Nazis burning books in the public square. The horrified look on Smith's face tells you that something has instantly changed within Christopher.
  One look at Imogen Poots, with her green eye make-up, ever-present cigarette and shaky singing voice, tells you that her character of Jean Ross is the real inspiration for Christopher's famous, fictionalized ""Sally Bowles."" Christopher and Jean are great friends, and he supports her through a difficult abortion. But where Cabaret"" takes the relationship between Christopher and ""Sally Bowles"" as one central plot point, the dramatic center of ""Kind"" is Christopher's deep love and devotion for Heinz (Douglas Booth). Their romance is risky and ill-fated. ""Kind"", in fact, ends on a bittersweet reunion between Christopher and Heinz in the early 1950's.
The performances, especially Smith, Booth, and Poots, are excellent. Toby Jones (""Infamous"", ""Captain America"") also shines in a supporting role as Gerald, an aging drag queen who befriends Christopher and mysteriously ""disappears"" shortly afterwards.  I found ""Kind"" to be emotionally haunting and extremely worthwhile.",1314662400,18,2989,5.369658119658119
4460897,2,B004RIACU4,"Curiously flat account of author Christopher Isherwood's sojourn in Berlin in the early 1930's.  He went there, as he put it, ""because of the boys"".  And he found them!  The ninety- minute film spends the first third or so chronicling Isherwood's hedonistic lifestyle in the decadent city hiring male prostitutes and enjoying himself in bed.  Then he finds his true love, and spends the remaining hour witnessing the rise of Hitler, and then attempting to get his lover out of Germany.  On the way he encounters the people he will make famous in his book ""Berlin Stories"".

Matt Smith plays Isherwood in a rather wooden fashion.  His character is unlikeable, and Smith makes him less so.  His concern over the growing Nazi menace and his decision to become a participant in affairs rather than just an onlooker never ring s true.  None of his fellow characters are particularly likeable either, although the Sally Bowles character is interesting.  Even the plight of his lover isn't particularly moving.  Thank heaven the ever excellent Lindsay Duncan, playing Isherwood's mother, is on hand to breathe some life into the goings on.

The production values are superb, as one would expect from the BBC.  But good costumes and sets and the presence of Duncan are not enough to save this one from mediocrity.",1311638400,8,1305,4.931192660550459
4460898,5,B004RIACU4,"In my youth, I became obsessed with the writings of Christopher Isherwood and always considered the movie ""Cabaret"" with Minnelli and Grey to be one of my very favorite films ever.  The aforesaid emotions of my youth persist to this day.  Therefore, when this British TV film ""Christopher and his Kind"" became available in this country, I readily purchased it and I am  so very glad that I did because it is splendidly directed and acted capturing the ""feel"" of Isherwood's pre World War II Berlin wonderfully.

For years after the marvelous film of ""Cabaret"" was released, Christopher Isherwood lamented that the film was not a true portrayal of what his life was really like in Berlin during the time being shown especially his supposed ""love affair"" with Sally Bowles.  This film of ""Christopher and his kind"" as in the book by the same name certainly goes a very long way in showing what it was really like for Christopher and his friends in Berlin before Hitler and his thugs took over.

The acting by all in this BBC film is simply great.  Matt Smith as Christopher in his youth is fantastic.  He acts Isherwood all ""wide-eyed"" with wonder at the sexual freedom, Berlin offered at the time.  Jean Ross is also great as the character that was to become Sally Bowles--vulnerable,""world weary""  and a little ""wild"".  (I adored the way the film emphasizes that she and Christopher were really good friends.)  In fact, all of the acting in this film is very good.

Be advised that although in ""Christopher and his Kind"", the viewing audience gets a good look at the decadence and the ""gay life"" that was in early 1930's Berlin, we are never allowed to forget that the horrors of the Nazis were just around the corner.  I really enjoyed this film.",1309564800,52,1747,4.685245901639345
4460899,4,B004RIACU4,"BBCVideo offers this truly inspired and (more importantly) faithful adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's memoir of the events that inspired his Berlin Stories.  Matt Smith (the current Doctor Who) stars as Isherwood, off to Berlin to join W. H. Auden in pursuit of....not culture, or education, but boys!  Most of Isherwood's fiction was thinly veiled autobiography and thus Christopher and His Kind could be interpreted as the unexpurgated Cabaret, for basically the stories are the same without the music. [Of course this made for television film doesn't really compare with the Fosse/Minnelli classic].

  Matt Smith plays Isherwood wonderfully well, capturing his initial sexual and political navet and burgeoning enlightenment.  Indeed, what is most impressive in the performance is that we witness the character develop - not just sexually (yes, the film is explicit), but more importantly, politically, and as a keen observer and able chronicler of personal and world events.

  As the flamboyant chanteuse Jean Ross - the inspiration for Sally Bowles, Isherwood's most indelible literary creation - Imogen Poots is breathtakingly world-weary and heart-sore, vulnerable and sincere; it's a special performance worthy of special recognition. The underrated Toby Jones scores again as the unforgettable Gerald Hamilton (read: Mr. Norris from Mr. Norris Changes Trains), fortune's fool and victim of time (he's an aging, balding queen) and his own ill-begotten schemes. Lindsay Duncan as Isherwood's deliciously manipulative mother is a treat, while Perry Millwood is wantonly earnest as his all but forgotten brother Richard.

  The script by Kevin Elyot and direction by Geoffrey Sax deserve praise for capturing the essence of Isherwood as well as the atmosphere of pre-war Berlin; in fact all the production elements are top drawer.  Over all this is a glorious production and deserves a wide audience.",1305331200,104,1911,5.548275862068966

It starts out very slowly with Isherwood's journey to Berlin and the pace picks up but it covers relationships and events very erratically so that one never gets a clear picture of place, people or time.

This is also a refreshing change from the usual victim portrayal of gay men with an even stranger twist of a closeted bisexual man, Alexander Doetsch/Caspar, who eventually becomes a Nazi.
Speaking of the stellar cast, my breakdown. Seeing my favorite Dr. Who portrayed by Matt Smith, Douglas Booth as Heinz portrays a true awkwardness on sexuality and when reunited is still charming, Imogen Poots/Jean as the obligatory straight girlfriend every gay guy has won't be outdone by Lindsay Duncan as the withering mother and Iddo Goldberg, the handsome heir to a Jewish department store.
