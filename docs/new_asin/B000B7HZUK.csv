2404625,5,B000B7HZUK,Leave It To Beaver is a series showing the widespread neglect of children in 1950's America. I am afraid nothing has changed since then. Don't leave it to your children. They need you.,1127174400,,184,4.606060606060606
2404626,5,B000B7HZUK,"Finally we get to see the Beaver, hopefully uncut and complete with epilogues and maybe commentary from the Beaver himself.

However, with the abysmal track record of Universal Home Video releases of Dragnet, ADAM-12 and EMERGENCY!, quality control-wise that is, I'm holding off on this one until the reviewers give the go ahead.  Hopefully Universal has learned their lesson but I doubt it.

Additionally, what is with Universal's narcissistic attitude regarding the Universal graphics intro when: loading the DVD, and then EVERYTIME at the begining of EACH episode.  I mean, come on!",1126828800,14,585,5.326086956521739

But i'm not going to complain if there isn't any special features,to have the episodes uncut is what realy matters.

2404637,5,B000B7HZUK,"I have been watching Leave It To Beaver ever since elementary school and never get tired of viewing it. Easily, it is on my short list of favorite television shows...arguably the favorite. Naturally, I was happy a few years back when the series finally made it to dvd.

LITB--which was almost titled, ""Wally and the Beav,"" premiered on CBS in 1957, moved to ABC for its second season, and aired for a grand total of six seasons. Each episode revolves around the Cleaver family, who live in Mayfield, USA, and some new mess that young, elementary-school-age Theodore ""Beaver"" Cleaver (Jerry Mathers), or his older brother, Wally (Tony Dow), have gotten themselves into...with usually both brothers ending up in the same mess at the same time (Beaver usually drags Wally down with him).

Please note: Beaver got his nickname from Wally, who (as a child) could not pronounce ""Theodore"". Somehow,Theodore came out as Beaver. Oooh-Kay.

Cast

I've already introduced our two ""heroes."" Ward and June Cleaver (Hugh Beaumont and Barbara Billingsley), are Wally and The Beav's parents, and are ever-present in each episode as they help their sons out with advice--or punishment--when the situation calls for it. I like that they are active parents, and very concerned for their children's welfare--but have a sense-of-humor about it.

Please Note: In season one, Ward is a bit--just a bit-- ""sillier"" and less-serious than in future seasons. June also takes a more active role in disciplining her children. In future seasons she will defer almost always to her husband in this regard.

Actually, Wally and Beaver wouldn't get into trouble at all if not for the bunch of characters they have picked out to be their friends:

Ken Osmond is Eddie Haskell. He is the mischievous, wise-cracking ""low-life"" (he really isn't that bad) who is squeaky-clean Wally's best friend. At least that's what he keeps telling Wally. Whenever Beaver gets into serious trouble, Eddie--perpetually polite and well-mannered (around parents)--is usually the reason behind it.

* In one of TVGuide's countless myriads of ""lists,"" Eddie Haskell was ranked as the 2nd most memorable television character of all-time. At least that's what my younger brother, Beav-, er, mrronald, told me.

Frank Bank is Clarence ""Lumpy"" Rutherford. He is a couple of years older than Wally, and is introduced to the series as a bully--but they later become friends. He isn't the brightest of people--in fact, by the show's third season, he is in the same grade as Wally due to his having been held back in school.  Look for veteran actor Richard Deacon as Lumpy's father, Fred Rutherford, and Ward's best friend (and co-worker).

Finally, Rusty Stevens is The Beav's best friend, Larry Mondello. His only ambition in life is to eat--and get Beaver into trouble. I must admit that, as a child, I wanted to punch Larry's lights out.

Season One contains 39 episodes in all, and they run for 25-26 minutes (imagine that today, huh?) each. No special features are included, but that's okay--I'm just happy to have the complete, uncut episodes.

Here are some episode synopses (SPOILER ALERT) of a few of my favorites:

Beaver Gets 'Spelled': The series premiere-October 4, 1957. Beaver's teacher, Ms. Canfield (Diane Brewster), gives him a note to take home to his parents. Beaver, thanks to some dire warnings from his ""friends,"" believes he is going to get kicked out of school--and turns to Wally for help. Uh-oh. Wally writes a ridiculous letter (signed Ward Cleaver--The Beaver's father) explaining to Miss Canfield and school principal, Mrs. Rayburn(Doris Packer) that both he and June have ""beaten"" Theodore--and ""please do not expel him!"" That is all I'm going to say about this episode. You can figure the rest out from here.

Oh, by the way, (I will add this) it turns out the note was simply a request to have Beaver play Smokey the Bear in the school play.

* This episode was not intended to be the series premiere. Another episode, Captain Jack (in which the brothers bring home a pet alligator and keep him in their commode), was originally shot as the premiere. However, CBS' censors delayed its airing due to the use of said commode being shown on camera. How times have changed.

* Eddie and Lumpy always get talked about as ""the bad guys"" on this show. In my opinion, the little ""punks"" Beav hangs out with are far worse. Especially in the later seasons.

Voodoo Magic. January 3, 1958. After disobeying their parents' orders to not see monster movies (thanks, Eddie Haskell!), the Beaver decides to put a voodoo curse (using a Raggedy Andy doll) on Eddie--who plays along. Beaver is alarmed that Eddie will die from the ""curse."" Ward, as he usually does, manages to straighten the whole mess out by episode's end.

Beaver: ""Wally, if Eddie dies, do you think I will get sent to the electric chair?""
Wally (sarcastically): ""Yeah, Beav. They even have a little booster seat for it just like at the barber shop.""

Lumpy Rutherford. January 24, 1958. Lumpy's debut, and he shows up bullying our heroes and extorting lunch money from them. Thanks to one of Ward's ""When I was a kid..."" stories, they plot their revenge by placing barrel hoops all around the back of Lumpy's home, and yell for him to come outside. Lumpy's father comes out instead and gets himself all bruised up. It does look painful to watch. Of course, the next night the Rutherfords visit the Cleavers for a game of bridge--but Beav and Wally think they are there to drag them to the police station! Hilarity ensues.

The Bank Account. February 14, 1958. Ward brings home a piggy bank for his sons in order to teach them the importance of thrift. Wally and Beaver want to use the money they save up to buy new baseball gloves instead. However, at the (most expensive) sporting goods store in town they get another idea on how to spend their money...even going and getting extra funds from their school bank accounts to make this major purchase. Ward, thanks to a phone call from Mrs. Rayburn, is furious, and in the middle of severely scolding his sons when the sporting goods package arrives at the Cleaver home. It turns out (we, as viewers, already know this, by the way) that Wally and Beaver bought their father a new hunting jacket--the delay in its arrival was due to its being monogrammed. A very good episode.

The Train Trip. April 9. 1958.  Wally and Beav are returning from visiting their Aunt Martha (Madge Kennedy), who lives upstate. They plead with her to let them act like ""grown-ups"" (yeah, right) and buy their own tickets. She reluctantly agrees, and the brothers wind up spending most of their money on junk food and comic books. They do not have enough money to return to Mayfield, so instead buy tickets ""to go as far as they can,"" and manage to convince the train conductor to let them go the rest of the way on credit. Ward, as he always manages to do, finds out about this and proceeds to blow the minds of his sons (be careful, Ward, there isn't a whole lot up there to begin with) by casually, that evening, mentioning to them the hectic day's events.

Tenting Tonight. April 30, 1958. Ward has to cancel a weekend camping trip with his sons due to his work. He promises to take them the following weekend, so Wally and Beav decide to spendthis weekend ""camping"" out in their back yard. Of course, a huge storm hits, but they manage to make it through the night--kinda sorta.  Let's just say that Ward gives his sons some much-needed (and appreciated) help by leaving the back door unlocked for them.

********

So, in conclusion, I am going to rate this first season with five stars--and, the best part is that the series only gets better as the kids get older. I particularly enjoy the later seasons when Wally is an upperclassman in high school. There are some great ""Wally, Eddie and Lumpy"" episodes featured then.

As always, though, no matter which season of Leave It To Beaver we are discussing, you can rest assured that you will always be entertained by this program...a program that is perfectly safe for the entire family to enjoy--and it never gets ""cheesy,"" either.

If you haven't already, check it out.

Thank you for reading.

The kids had true freedom to go anywhere without fear, freedom to be creative in a framework of loving care, and a sense that all was going to have a good ending when they grew up. Somehow they managed to survive without cell phones, computers, seat belts, crash helmets for bicycles, sick movies, political correctness, and thousands of over controlling rules.

I grew up with this family in the background of my childhood and had forgotton how wonderful the lessons learned each week with a father that was not the brunt of jokes, as they are on current TV sitcoms.

What a refreshing change of pace to see an American family with usual ups and downs and parents acting like parents and kids acting like kids.

2404817,5,B000B7HZUK,"""Leave It To Beaver,"" as this DVD shows, was just old-fashioned wholesomeness while being really funny and entertaining at the same time. It was one of the best shows ever on TV, and it's a shame only two seasons of it have come out on disc.

When I first watched this first DVD, it occurred to me that I don't think I ever saw the first season when it was on television way bay when so I was a little shocked how young the kids looked and sounded. For instance, ""Wally"" and ""Eddie"" having fairly high voices, on the verge of puberty?  Yup.  It must have been the following year and all those that followed that they had their ""normal"" voices.

The first year also had a couple of kids in here I didn't recall seeing in the rest of the series, kids like ""Toohey.""  I was disappointed there was no ""Lumpy,"" who didn't arrive on the show until late the following year.  All the kids, though, were great and delivered some really funny lines. Some of the best dialog ever on this show came in the first year.  Actors like Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow were so good that they sounded real, not like somebody acting.

Most of the stories deal with the kids getting into some kind of trouble, either through crazy schemes or lying about something (but not maliciously) but all turning out well in the end with good lessons learned.  The kids are always remorseful and the moral lessons of each story come through loud and clear, but not preachy.  Great stuff!",1263859200,2,1450,4.417293233082707

I still get a kick out of June vacuuming in a dress, high heels and pearls. Seriously, this is one of the best TV shows around, and Wally and The Beaver are funny, sincere, innocent, and, just boys. You will love, as I did, ""Captain Jack"", as the boys send away for a baby alligator (honest!) and feed it with milk, eggs, and cooking sherry. You will truly love the pure charm and simplicity of these episodes.

2404837,3,B000B7HZUK,"Leave it to Beaver is a product of its time, a wholesome and amusing sitcom. It is not, by any means, hysterically funny, nor is it supposed to be. If I want slapstick I watch Lucy or Gilligan or Jeannie. This show is good, clean, old fashioned family values. It paints an innocent Rockwell image of an America that perhaps once was, one that many people pine for. I suspect that this is the type of world that inspired David Lynch to create his movie ""Blue Velvet"" (white picket fences, smiling neighbors, the ice cream man...)

These are such fun to watch just for all the cool stuff that has since faded: rotary phones, milk delivery, malt shops, and so on. Yes, some would call it very 'white bread' or unrealistic. But it's not a documentary, now is it? It's family entertainment from yesteryear.

I must say that watching several episodes in a row may not be the best way to view this. It is absolutely staggering that the writers constantly kept going back to the 'Beaver tells a lie' well, and milked that little plot point way too many times. I suppose when it was originally airing, a weekly dose was probably very cute. But, the boy tells a blatant lie every other week, and he never learns his lesson (although he seems to at the end of each episode).

Still, it's a hoot to revisit the 1950's style, fashions, traditions, and delightful slang (""Like fun you will!"", Wally snears at Eddie, his pugnosed nostrils flaring). Shows like this are a fascinating time capsule of sorts, although I suspect they're entirely much more squeaky clean than the real experience might be.

Now if only we could see a dvd release of another sweet black-and-white gem, ""Dennis the Menace"", with little Jay North and the wonderful Joseph Kearns as good ol' Mister Wilson. That'd be real neato.",1200268800,,1787,4.62776025236593
2404838,5,B000B7HZUK,"Without question, Season One of Leave It To Beaver delivers an ultra-high quality series of wholesome, humorous, and family centered episodes that any age group can easily interpret and appreciate.  As a husband and father of several children in the kindergarten through high school range, it's a real treat to see everyone watch these together and thoroughly enjoy them.

Of course, given these particular episodes are now 50 years old, there are certian dated perspectives relative to the working husband and the stay-at-home wife, but it's typically subtle enough that it doesn't interfere with the underlying message of kindness, caring, and respect for family and community.  In spite of the late 1950's setting, the timelessness of the content, and the masterful manner in which it is delivered shine through with great intensity.

Not to imply that there is nothing of value to watch from the contempory offerings of today, but when you consider how much innappropriate material your children could potentially stumble upon, I can't see how anyone could go wrong with these on their shelf.  Simply put, Leave It To Beaver is classic American television at it's finest.",1200009600,,1175,5.195767195767195
2404839,5,B000B7HZUK,"If you grew up in the '50's, then you don't need any hype for ""Leave It to Beaver."" Why? Because the whole country LOVED the Beave, Mom and Dad, Wally and all the various school teachers and friends (especially Eddie Haskell, the rascal)! Season 1 is so nostalgic for me because it brings back Larry Mathers (Theodore Cleaver) when he was his youngest and cutest. Sure the situations seem old-fashioned and dated now (June wearing a dress around the house; Ward almost always in a suit and tie), but that's the way it was back then: more polite, restrained, formal, but still (some of you younger readers may laugh) quite human and normal. The thing about this show is that it is totally clean and deals with the problems that a little boy (and others) might deal with while growing up. No one uses God's name in vain, people don't live together in sin, they are not crude or lewd in their behavior, the violence is limited to a little girl socking Beaver in the eye (!) and similar juvenile acts . . . and it's all just plain fun. In addition to loving Beaver's slow but sure understanding of life and ideas and concepts and words at age 7 or 8, I most enjoy and remember dad Ward Cleaver giving sage advice and wise counsel to his son(s). Idealized? Yes, but who cares? Shouldn't we all strive for the nice, clean lives that this show depicts. I highly recommend it!

I wish Universal Studios would take better care in how they assemble their products.

Anyways, LITB is a five-star rated show and it's great to see the whole gang on DVD - Beaver (Theodore), Wally, Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver, Lumpy (Clarence), Eddie Haskell, Larry Mondello, Judy Hensler, Whitey, etc.  It's an instant CLASSIC for all ages who would rather watch something that doesn't have any degrading material like shows do today.

I also noticed that Ward and June have a fun relationship, teasing each other and such. June is also a hands on mom and isn't afraid to pitch in and do work when the boys need help. Also, many of the episodes encourage entrepreneurial behavior or working for money.

My favorite, everyone makes fun of Beaver for selling water on one of the hottest day of the year, because water is free---until he learns the water will be turned off for several hours just when Wally and all of his friends are doing yardwork to earn money for baseball uniforms.
Aquafina anyone?

The relationship between the boys is sweet without being sappy as is the relationship between the boys and their parents. A few moments almost made me want to cry because they are moments of truth that I now recognize as an adult.

I am losing my patience though waiting for season three. I think the fans have waited long enough, so what's the holdup. I get sick of seeing shows that haven't even been on longer than a season already being put out on DVD and they can't even compare to the Beav.

2404863,2,B000B7HZUK,"As the title of this review states, the sitcom Leave it to Beaver (LITB) is the reason why we're considering buying this Dvd set. It's an old show with a long established fan base. The most important reason for this review, in my opinion, is to rate the quality of the Dvd set. I have to say that in comparison to offerings from other studios, the quality of Universal's Dvd set's seem to be lacking; and it's not just LITB. I've read reviews of other Universal sets and they have a commonality. Poor to mediocre picture quality, less desirable double sided disks,and lack of extras. Two important reasons to recommend shelling out hard earned cash for an old show that we've seen a thousand times is superior picture quality and extras that we've never seen before. It seems most of the glowing reviews of this show and others are based on our affinity for the show and not the quality of the Dvd set. As long as we keep liberally spending our money while getting caught up in childhood nostalgia, what's the incentive for studios like Universal to do better next time. I purchased season one, but don't plan on buying any further seasons unless Universal gets serious and doesn't just treat LITB as just another cash cow. It seems Beaver and the rest of the Cleavers (and the fans) are just victims of a careless studio.",1161129600,18,1322,4.582278481012659
2404864,4,B000B7HZUK,"LEAVE IT TO BEAVER - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON (Universal) is the breakthrough TV sitcom from 1957 that gently mocks a middle class, heartland American family with a dad that didn't have all the answers. 39 half-hour episodes on three two-sided discs bring sharp digital versions of the Cleaver clan.  There's young mischievous Beaver, his cool big brother Wally, flawed but well-meaning dad Ward and wise, together mom June.  Oh, and that awful neighbor boy Eddie Haskell, Wally's duplicitous pal.

It was an innocent time and the growing pains usually revolved around the dissonance between Beaver and Wally who are about five years apart.  Simple set-ups generate honest yuks.  For instance, Beaver, told not to hurt his baby sitting spinster aunt's feelings is forced to wear short pants she bought for him to wear to third grade.  Or Wally is dealing with a crush on a girl in a dance class and can't take Beaver fishing.

I was surprised well this series holds up.  I laughed out loud (and so did my two boys who ""related"") at these retro, gentle, often quirky comic episodes with their comfy back lot exteriors and feel good conclusions.

This DVD set is perfect nostalgia for the generation of baby boomers approaching retirement.  ""Gee Beav, dad's gonna be mad.""  Indeed.",1158451200,,1280,4.906976744186046

I have had no problems with the two-sided disks, but occasionally green stripes appear on the edge of the TV screen for a few seconds (very obvious when watching a B&W show).

Yes, yes people complain on how June is always so well dressed for a stay at home mom, or how Ward sits down to dinner, at home mind you, with a tie and jacket, but my wife and I just find that part of the charm of the show. Remember it's just a show, it's there to entertain. To tell you the truth, we find ourselves laughing harder with LITB then with most of the TV sitcoms out there today.

However, the previews on this DVD are the exact opposite of the innocent LITB world.

Commercials for Kolchak: The Night Stalker and American Gothic include images of a man wielding an ax, monsters attacking, people burning in fire and the face of a corpse dripping blood from its eyes.

We are then treated to a montage of mostly R rated movies from Focus Features.

My Summer of Love is described as ""a sexy new drama"" while bikini clad women (who are apparently lovers) splash each other with water. This is followed by images from The Ice Harvest, The Pianist, The Constant Gardener, Far From Heaven, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Lost in Translation, The Motorcycle Diaries, Traffic, 21 Grams and ends with an ad for Brokeback Mountain.

2404879,5,B000B7HZUK,"It's hard to believe that it took so long for the television classic ""Leave it to Beaver"" to be released on DVD.  It's good to see that it's finally shown up though, and even better to see that the second season is now slated for release too.  It looks like ""The Beav"" escaped the seemingly endless wait between first and second season releases that some shows suffer (Mary Tyler Moore, anyone?)

All 39 episodes are here, and they are all the original uncut ABC versions.  They even include the teasers immediately preceeding the opening theme song.  In some cases, the teaser is actually a scene that was not even used in the episode itself, which is quite a treat to see.  Contrary to popular belief, those teasers HAVE been seen since the original airings.  Although they are nowhere to be found on TV Land, I DID see them back in the summer of 1989 on KDNL-TV 30 out of St. Louis.  As I recall, those versions weren't missing very much, as some of them still had the epilogues, too.  But there is NOTHING missing here, and that is a form of bonus material for viewers who've seen nothing but the current syndication airings.  As an added bonus, the original pilot episode is also included here.  It has some different actors in it, and watching it makes you realize how good the final cast was together.  For shows like this, it's always hard to imagine anyone other than the final actors playing the beloved roles, but original pilots such as this often afford us the opportunity to see what could have been, but fortunately was not.

The film transfers for the most part look pretty good.  The inside scenes have more grain, but that isn't too distracting and is somewhat expected from films this old.  The outdoor scenes seem to be exceptionally clear, though.  I'm not sure why there is a difference, but there most definitely is and you will notice it immediately.  Despite the minor picture imperfections, you will still glean much viewing enjoyment from this set.

If you enjoy classic television or are looking for something that you can let your children watch without having to worry about them seeing or hearing anything they shouldn't, then you can't miss with this set.  Let these great old shows take you back to a time when parents had all the answers, big brothers had your back and no ratings system was required!",1140480000,5,2335,4.637469586374696
2404880,5,B000B7HZUK,"My husband bought me this set for my birthday. It's one of my most prized possessions. I remember watching it as a child on a televison set that had a green screen! I wish I had paid more attention to it then as I'm always telling my 3 grown children that if I could go back they would have been raised like Beaver and Wally!

Just looking at Ward can sometimes bring tears to my eyes. He and June were the perfect parents. It's amusing to see how different things were back then. For instance, when one of the boys gets in trouble who does the principal ask to talk to? Ward of course! June will say is there something I can help with and the principal responds, no I really need to talk to Mr. Cleaver! That wouldn't go over too well these days!

It was a show of innocence, boys getting in trouble but they always have a guilty conscience and have to do the right thing. There are so many lessons in this series about how children should be raised, with love, affection and discipline! Ward and June were never too hard on the boys but the boys certainly got the message when they did something wrong. I can't imagine anyone in this series being played by any other actor. I watched the Small World episode and it made me very sad. I didn't want to see anyone but Hugh Beaumont and Tony Dow!

The only improvement that I would like would be for the discs to be one sided. You really have to be careful handling them.

2404887,5,B000B7HZUK,"No more TV Land for season one of ""Leave it to Beaver."" No more truncated episodes, no more soft/pixellated images, no more ads (or pre-emptions) for the likes of ""Chasing Farrah."" Here we just have the Cleaver family, as originally broadcast, with no edits or interruptions to spoil things.

The first season isn't my favorite, this is one show that simply got better...but there's enough here to love. The set would almost be worth the money for two episodes alone, the one where poor Beaver tries to give himself a haircut (this crisis hits much closer to home than I'd care to admit), and the one where Beaver and Wally get a job delivering newspapers.

There have been many comments about image quality in the set--most notably, grain. The grain is there, and very noticeable, but it doesn't appear to be a mastering error or inferior source material. My guess as to the culprit would be the film stock and/or lighting for scenes shot indoors, as outdoor shots in each episode have no visible grain. This wouldn't have been an issue to worry about in 1957, as no consumer television on the market had sufficient resolution for this anomaly to be visible.

This issue aside, there's very little to complain about, except the annoying Universal logo/fanfare that precedes each episode. If you're a fan of ""Leave it to Beaver,"" or even a potential fan, buy the set without hesitation.

I viewed episodes on a smaller 20 inch set as well as a flat screen 27 inch, and both looked fine.

I have not played the entire set yet, but so far have not encountered any technical problems with the disks themselves (that's why only a 4 star rating).

Anyway, I have been buying all these older shows... but never this old. I was weaned on the age just after this, I'm more or less a Brady Child. As scary as that sounds I'm proud:) I noticed there is not a lot coming out right now, or I have everything I want. I'm about halfway through Rockford, Bewitched Season Two was a given, and as I sit and WAIT for Starsky and Hutch Season 4 I thought I'd throw down the funds for the Beav.

I have seen the show don't get me wrong, but if there is one thing I can be reeled in on is any mention of ""pilots with different actors"", I'm just a sucker for this nostalgia-of-what-could-have-been. I watched that first and was delighted, I knew the writing was top notch from my Munsters set I have and was pleased to see this series was on par. I knew from there I'd like it. Mathers is almost eerie, he really was a stand out childhood actor. As I watched the next few episodes I realized Dow was probably there for future eye candy, but despite his general lacking the chemistry between the two just clicks. Hugh and Barbera while a bit erratic in their descision making just complete the package.

The dvd package is nothing great but it is fuctional. There are not a bevy of extras but this is from '57 after all. The two sided discs do not bother me as long as they WORK. And while I do like the simple white packaging I'm hoping more imagination can be used in the artwork next time, like was done by Paramount on the Andy Griffith sets, now those are interesting. The picture is somewhat grainy and is nowhere near the great quality of the Andy Griffith Show remaster, but nowhere near as BAD as the public domain junk... so I guess that's somewhere in the middle.

I must add this edit: I just watched the episode ""Water, Anyone?"" and could not believe how things have changed! The characters were SO AGHAST at having to PAY for water!! If only they knew what changes were about to come...  *sigh*

Another EDIT: My ""Short Pants"" episode had periods of freezing and pixelating which is a shame:(( This episode with Aunt Martha is really one the of the great ones, if the set has any more problems I will be sure to report in here and for sure exchange it... what a hassle, thanks Universal.

2404893,4,B000B7HZUK,"Universal Studios has finally released the long awaited, first season DVD of ""Leave It To Beaver."" I'm NOT going to go into all the details of this DVD set since others have already done so.
However, being a perfectionist when it comes to video quality, I will say that the episodes presented in this DVD set, don't look as good as they could have. While the picture quality is sharper than the episodes currently being shown on TV Land, the DVD set  episodes have a ""grainy"" quality. This is most likely because  Universal chose to make this DVD set using 16mm print masters  rather than using their 35mm print masters. Use of the 35mm masters would have yielded a more pristine picture. Unfortunately, Universal went the cheaper 16mm route and it shows.
On a postive note, the contrast levels on these episodes are quite good, with good grays and blacks. The prints are for the most part, clean with some looking less ""grainy"" than others. Outdoor shots showed less grain then the indoor shots. These episodes also appear to be unedited...a big plus. The audio is clear and presented in it's original mono format.
This DVD set is a definite must buy for all you ""Leave It To Beaver"" fans, just understand that it could and should have looked better.",1134691200,7,1251,4.677272727272728

I've seen others quibble about the use of dual sided discs, and about the lack of chapter stops, but those ""problems"" are just minor inconveniences.  Each episode is only 24-5 minutes so chapter stops are probably not critical unless you watch with numerous interruptions.  The bottom line is that we finally have this on DVD.

This grainy image quality to me is why I can't recommend the set as a purchase at this price.  The episodes themselves have no chapter stops within them -- not a big deal, but another indication that Universal didn't put a lot of effort into this.  And even more disappointing is the lack of special features.  You'd think that when a show has so many cast members still around, that an effort would have been made to have them do some commentaries or interviews, but such is not the case.  Other reviewers have mentioned that the set is on dual sided DVD-18s which are often problematic.  I haven't had any trouble yet, although I'm not all the way through every episode.  Nevertheless, the choice of DVD-18s instead of single sided DVD-9s (as in the Lucy sets) is another indication that Universal continues to opt for cheapness over quality.

2404897,5,B000B7HZUK,"I am SO glad to see this on DVD! I was pleasantly surprised to see this at the friends house the other day and I was like WHOA!

When I was a child in the 60s and 70s, just about every city showed this in syndication, usually right after school. Kids loved Beaver because most kids could identify with the fear of having your parents find out that you unintentionally messed up, although Ward and June never took a strap to young Theodore Cleaver. Today's generation is not likely to know about this, as I don't recall it being on television (aside from TV Land) since about 1984.

But this is a cool set. It includes the rare pilot, which has another actor as Ward Cleaver, which is a bit jarring. We see Beav in a couple of standout episodes, such as where he ""exploits"" (Ward's word) his friends by selling water to them when he learns that a walve would be shut off. We also see his shame over getting a Black eye from a girl and the early nerdiness of Clarence/Lumpy (who runs crying ""Daddy"" to his father whenever he faces a problem welll into his teens)and the rakish Eddie Haskell.

No, he doesn't fall into the cup and saucer on this set, nor does he encounter the alcoholic handyman, and we don't see Wally and beaver try out their truly 50ish ""ducktail"" haircuts. Those episodes are sure to be in later sets, and they're classic.

This was (and is) great TV that kids and adults could still enjoy together, although Beaver's 50s kid talk like ""I'll clobber ya rat"" and ""Clunky girl"" will cause either puzzlement or unintended laughter among today's small fry. Back in the 70s, during the popularity of the faux-50s show ""Happy Days,"" reruns of ""Beaver"" were billed as ""The REAL Happy days."" Oprah Winfrey has also said that this was her favorite show as a child. Watch this and you'll see why.",1132963200,5,1804,4.474164133738602

--------------------------------------------------

The 1950s-1960s family sitcom ""Leave It To Beaver"" had never been made available to fans via any kind of major studio release on home video throughout all these many years of home-video formats (Beta, VHS, LD, or DVD) -- until the long-awaited date of November 22, 2005, when Universal Studios Home Entertainment released ""Leave It To Beaver: The Complete First Season"" on DVD.

And the first 39 ""Beaver"" episodes look just terrific here. The video quality for these black-and-white programs is extremely good, and the audio is very good too (by way of the very pleasant and clean-sounding Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtracks that faithfully reproduce each episode's original Mono audio).

Thankfully, Universal has done a bang-up job with the digital transfers here, and these shows (which were originally photographed on film, not videotape) look and sound fabulous on these DVDs.

There is, however, a good deal of fine ""film grain"" contained within a lot of these episodes, but I'm assuming that is simply inherent to the type of film stock that was used for this series. The grain isn't very distracting (at least I don't have a major problem with the grain speckles that exist here). Interestingly, though, I've noticed that many scenes in these episodes don't seem to have any ""grain"" in them at all, while other scenes contain a lot more. The ""outdoor"" shots look almost completely grain-free.

Another very pleasing thing to me personally is the fact that all these DVDs pass the ""freeze-frame test"" with flying colors (i.e., when pausing or freezing an image on screen, the video doesn't ""blur"" at all; it stays rock-solid and clear while in ""pause"" mode; which, IMO, is a sign of a good film-to-DVD transfer).

All things considered, I could not be happier with the way these episodes look on these DVDs! And thus far I have no complaints about the performance of the sometimes-temperamental two-sided discs that Universal insists upon using for its TV-DVD releases. Nary a hitch has been experienced while playing these discs.

According to the stats on the packaging, the episode running times here average out to exactly 26 minutes per program (including the 40th episode in the set, the Pilot), which indicates to me that the following pleasing terms apply here: ""Full""/""Complete""/""Uncut""/""Unedited""! And this is great to see, because the syndicated versions of this series that have aired on commercial TV for decades have all been hacked to pieces, with each episode having at least a few minutes sliced out of it due to commercial time restraints.

I did a ""time check"" for each of the seven LITB shows on Side A of Disc #1. The results made me smile (in an ""uncut"" and ""complete"" sort of fashion). Here are those run times (not counting the 22-second Universal fanfare and logo that's included prior to every episode, which can be quickly bypassed via the Chapter button):

""Beaver Gets 'Spelled"" -- 25:48.
""Captain Jack"" -- 25:48.
""The Black Eye"" -- 25:49.
""The Haircut"" -- 25:44.
""New Neighbors"" -- 25:44.
""Brotherly Love"" -- 25:37.
""Water, Anyone?"" -- 25:44.

So I think it's safe to say that when fans view any of these 39 programs, they will probably be seeing them uncut for the first time since their original network TV airings in the late 1950s. I'm guessing that everyone who buys this DVD set will be seeing some scenes in a lot of these episodes that they had never seen previously. That fact kind of serves as an ""added value"" item all by itself.

I'm also glad to see that these DVDs retain all of the ""Previews"" (or ""Teasers"") for the first-season ""Beaver"" programs. These brief preview clips were shown just prior to the opening titles and give an overview of what's coming up in that episode. These pre-show snippets, which last about 20 to 30 seconds each, were only done for the first season. Hugh Beaumont served as ""narrator"" for the teasers on the first 16 episodes. For the year's final 23 shows, however, Hugh's voice is not heard, with just an episode clip provided (sans any voice-over narration).

------------------

""Leave It To Beaver"" premiered on CBS-TV on Friday, October 4, 1957, and continued on network TV for a total of six seasons, finishing its 234-episode run in 1963. Each of the six seasons consisted of exactly 39 episodes, a hefty number by today's seasonal standards. CBS carried the show for the first season only. For the final five years, ""Beaver"" was a part of the ABC-TV schedule.

The storylines used for ""Beaver"" were always very simple and uncomplicated, which is probably why it's so charming and appealing. No major earth-shattering disasters ever befall the Cleavers. Nobody ever gets hurt (except an occasional scraped knee), the parents (Ward and June) rarely fight about anything serious and never threaten to leave each other (like you might see on a show today), and above all, these characters really seemed to care about each other, without getting overly sappy and sentimental about it. All of these traits helped make ""Leave It To Beaver"" what it was each week in 1957, and what I believe it remains today: just a good, clean, fun, uncomplicated half-hour of entertaining television.

Starring Jerry Mathers as ""Theodore (Beaver) Cleaver"", Tony Dow as his brother ""Wally"", Barbara Billingsley as ""June"", and Hugh Beaumont as ""Ward"", the excellent cast of ""Leave It To Beaver"" was a well-chosen group in my opinion. While it's true, I suppose, that the acting was a bit on the ""stiff"" side on many occasions, I still think that this ensemble did quite well on this show. A sense of true believability and realism finds its way quite comfortably into each of these episodes.

Toss into this cast grouping the very funny Richard Deacon, who portrayed Ward's friend and co-worker, ""Fred Rutherford"", plus Ken Osmond as the ever-sarcastic ""Eddie Haskell"", Frank Bank as the wimpish (but always likeable) ""Lumpy Rutherford"", Rusty Stevens as ""Larry Mondello"", and all of Beaver's and Wally's other various friends, classmates, and schoolteachers, and you've got a really first-rate supporting cast of characters to build stories around.

Some of my favorite shows from this Season #1 Beaver batch include ..... ""The Black Eye"", ""Beaver's Short Pants"", ""Party Invitation"", ""The Bank Account"", ""Train Trip"", ""The Perfect Father"", ""Beaver Runs Away"", ""Tenting Tonight"", and my #1 fave from this season, ""The Haircut"", which has Beaver getting scalped by barber Wally in one of the funniest episodes of the whole series.

There's also the funny ""Captain Jack"" episode -- which was the very first show to be filmed; but was the second program to be aired. ""Captain Jack"" has Wally and Beaver sending away for a pet alligator, and includes the very funny scene where ""Minerva"" (the maid who we never see again) comes running up the basement stairs screaming ""Help! A monster! There's an alligator in the basement!"" .... This is followed by Ward's skeptical -- ""An alligator?!"" (LOL.)

""Captain Jack"" also has the distinction of being the very first episode in television history to show a toilet on screen. (The ""tank"" portion of the Cleaver toilet is shown, not the [~gasp!~] ""bowl"" itself.) :-)

In fact, it was the ""toilet"" scene in ""Captain Jack"" that kept that episode from being aired by CBS as the debut show of the series in late 1957. But LITB show executives, including writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher (who authored a great number of the 234 ""Beaver"" programs throughout its 6-year history, including ""Captain Jack""), stuck by their guns and won the ""toilet battle"" with CBS bigwigs, and thus ""Captain Jack"" (toilet scene intact) was approved for network broadcast one week later, being aired on October 11, 1957, as ""Leave It To Beaver"" episode #2.

And yet another winning Season-One entry is entitled simply ""Lumpy Rutherford"" -- where we get our first look at ""Clarence Rutherford"", known to most people as ""Lumpy"" (or ""The Lump""). You'll note how Lumpy goes from being one of Wally's feared enemies to one of his best friends as the series progresses.

There's also a very nifty bonus program located on Disc 3 of this set -- the original ""Leave It To Beaver"" Pilot episode, entitled ""It's A Small World"", which originally aired on April 23, 1957, as an installment of the syndicated anthology program ""Studio 57"". The pilot episode is a pretty decent show too, IMHO, with a good storyline (unlike a lot of series-launching pilots I've seen). It's fun to be able to see the ""genesis"" of the series via the pilot, and I commend Universal for including it in this collection.

Both Barbara Billingsley and Jerry Mathers co-star in the ""Small World"" pilot program, but different actors were cast in the roles of Wally and Ward. Paul Sullivan played Wally; while Casey Adams (aka Max Showalter) filled Ward's shoes for the pilot only.

A 13-year-old Harry Shearer (famed voice actor on ""The Simpsons"") also was featured in the cast of the pilot episode. It's a small part for Shearer, but he was very good as ""Frankie Bennett"", an Eddie Haskell-like smart-aleck. I was very impressed by the ""naturalness"" of Harry's performance.

""Leave It To Beaver"" veterans Richard Deacon and Diane Brewster also are featured in the pilot (although not in the same roles that they ended up playing in the series). Deacon's part, in fact, is a fairly extensive one (as an executive for the ""Franklin Milk Company"").

The pilot has survived in very good shape too (""PQ""-wise). The video quality looks about the same as the other episodes in this set, meaning it's quite good indeed. And it appears that the pilot is uncut/unedited as well, with a running time of 25:02.

------------------

Let's Talk Packaging.........

Universal has offered up two different packaging variants for Season One of LITB. Each version is a 3-Disc set containing the exact same disc content. You can choose the lower-priced package, which comes with a standard-style slipcase box that holds three ""slim"" plastic cases (one for each of the double-sided DVDs).

Or -- There's the ""Limited Edition"" version, which includes ""Premium Packaging"" in the form of a collectible ""Beaver Cleaver Lunch Box"". The Lunch Box is decked out in a plaid design, and there's a good-looking picture of a smiling Theodore ""Beaver"" Cleaver on one side of the box (although I don't think it's a ""Season 1"" photo of The Beav); while a pic of the whole Cleaver family resides on the other side.

It's not a full-sized lunch box, however (and it doesn't come with a beverage-carrying thermos either; ~wink~). It's a mini version of the type of metal lunch box that can be seen used by Beaver in several episodes of LITB.

The Limited Lunch Box version also includes a ""Cleaver Family Photo Album"", which is a mini-album containing six promotional snapshots of the Cleaver clan (plus one of Eddie Haskell). The photos have a quote from the series written on the front, but no writing or captions on the back side. Each B&W pic is removable and slides into a clear plastic sleeve. The album is nice-looking and sports a thick and well-""padded"" vinyl-like cover.

Now the bad news re. the Lunch-Box edition ..... Unfortunately, the Lunch-Box set does not include the regular-style disc-holding case that comes with the Standard set. The discs, instead, are held inside the photo album in three plastic sleeves. This, IMO, is not a good way to store these two-sided discs. They are being rubbed up against the album sleeves whenever they're taken out or returned to the sleeves, making them possibly prone to getting scratched more easily.

Plus, the way the album is designed, it's a bit difficult to get the discs out without a semi-struggle. Another debit is the fact you're almost forced to handle the data sides of the discs in order to get them out of their sleeves. You cannot use my preferred method of ""disc handling"", which is to pick the DVD up by sticking your finger in the center hole, while never having to touch the A or B side of the disc.

Another (major) negative factor to the Limited Edition is the lack of any episode information anywhere. There's no ep. guide booklet, nor are the episode titles listed anyplace on the disc-holding sleeves inside the album (and no DVD specifications info either). Not a good thing. In fact, this lack of ANY program information is just flat-out ridiculous (especially for a product touted as a ""Premium Gift Set"").

But, still, to take a positive approach to this packaging topic, at least Universal is offering up a choice for customers, instead of providing ONLY an oddly-shaped disc-holding device.

While I like the Lunch Box and the photo album, I'd still recommend getting the standard set instead (due to its inclusion of a better and sturdier case to hold the actual DVDs; the ""slim cases"" are far better for housing the discs than the flimsier ""sleeves"" that come with the Lunch-Box pack).

And, frankly, for the extra cost of a ""Premium Limited Edition"" set, I would have expected much better packaging for the actual discs, rather than just the sleeves which are provided. After all, it's the discs themselves which are the ""heart"" of the collection; they deserve a better permanent home than what is provided in the Limited Edition, in my opinion. (Just doesn't make much sense to me -- Universal offers a set that they claim has ""Premium Packaging""; and yet the packaging for the actual DVDs is far inferior to the non-premium alternative. Most curious indeed.)

Also -- Three of the six photos that come with the Limited Edition set are the exact pictures that can be found printed on the back covers of the three slim cases that come in the Standard LITB edition. That fact dilutes the ""exclusivity"" of the Limited Edition a trifle, because those same pics can be seen on the Standard packaging too.

More Packaging Notes ..... The ""Standard"" set's slim (clear) cases feature different photos on each case -- with just ""The Beaver"" on the first case, a pic of Wally and The Beav on case #2, and a family snapshot on the third one. Episode titles for each disc are shown on the back of each slim case. There are no photos (or text) printed on the inside of the slim cases, which makes things seem a bit barren and bland when you open the cases. (But at least they aren't just thrown in sleeves.) ;)

The Standard set's outer cardboard box is simple in nature (and color) -- pretty much just plain white (with shiny gold lettering used for the show title, which looks classy). I like this plain white design for the cover, though. It has a kind of ""vanilla"" look to it, befitting the very simple and ""vanilla""-flavored (but always fun-to-watch) episodes contained within this all-white box. Looks nice. Simple...but nice.

One small gripe I do have with the Standard set's box is the lack of any ""Season 1"" notation on the spine of the box. There should at least be a ""1"" printed someplace on the spine to separate this set from future LITB releases. This is the very first TV-on-DVD set I've ever bought that has no season-number markings on the spine whatsoever. A curious omission.

------------------

Menu Info ..... A nice, simple non-animated Menu design here. A picture of the Cleaver family is shown on the Main Menu for all discs. The LITB theme music plays on a continuous loop while the Main Menu is on screen. All other Sub-Menus are silent. Menu selections include: ""Episode Index"", ""Languages"", and a ""Play All"" option (plus a ""Bonus Episode"" Menu choice on Side B of Disc 3, for the Pilot ep.). English and Spanish subtitles are also available. When an episode is selected, an ""Episode Summary"" Sub-Menu is displayed, which includes a synopsis for that episode and the original airdate.

From the ""Real Neat Episode Index"" (which is what it's called on the Menu to give things a genuine ""Beaver Cleaver"" flavor) there's an additional Sub-Menu that can be accessed, an ""Episode List"", which contains a listing of all the episode titles for Season 1 (on six Menu screens).

No chapter stops have been inserted for any of these programs; and that's a shame. At least a minimal number of chapter breaks would have been nice.

Some ads for other Universal DVDs come into view upon load-up of Disc 1 only (and only on Side A of Disc 1); but these advertisements, which last 4.5 minutes, can quickly be skipped via the remote control. The other normal mini-annoyances of DVD start-up (e.g., the studio logo and the FBI Warnings) can also be skipped in rapid fashion, which is a plus.

------------------

Here now is a look at all 39 first-season LITB episodes that are included in this 3-Disc set (the shows are arranged in ""Airdate Order"" on the discs, just as shown below). The original CBS-TV broadcast dates are also included in the following list, as well as some selected episode descriptions and funny quotes from some of my favorite episodes........

LEAVE IT TO BEAVER -- SEASON #1 (1957-1958):

1. ""Beaver Gets 'Spelled"" (First Aired: October 4, 1957) -- This very first LITB episode has little Theodore terribly upset after he's given a note to take home from school. .... Watch for the very funny (and somewhat ""racy"", for 1957 standards) dialogue exchange between June and Ward after June receives some flowers from Beaver's school principal that were really meant for Ward as a 'get-well' gift. June asks her hubby, suspiciously: ""Who's Cornelia Rayburn, and when did she see YOU off your feet?!"" ~ROFL!~ .... ""Leave It To Beaver"" shared its premiere date with another historic ""first"" -- the Russians launched the first Earth-orbiting satellite (""Sputnik 1"") on the very same day, 10/4/57. It's up to you to decide which event was the most significant -- Beaver's debut or Sputnik's? ~scratching cranium~ :>)

2. ""Captain Jack"" (October 11, 1957) -- Via a magazine ad, the boys send away for a ""Genuine Florida Everglades Alligator"" for $2.50. .... ""You know, the little fella didn't actually bite me; he kind of 'sawed' at me!""

3. ""The Black Eye"" (October 18, 1957) -- ""Wally, you mean to tell me that a GIRL gave Beaver that black eye? And I practically sent him over there to annihilate her!""

4. ""The Haircut"" (October 25, 1957) -- This is an episode filled with laugh-out-loud moments, after Beaver loses his haircut money and decides to perform the hair-trimming himself (with a little help from brother Wallace). .... ""Do you have to wear those awful caps night and day for a whole week?"" ---> ""That oughta do it!""

5. ""New Neighbors"" (November 1, 1957) -- ""Dad, have you ever kissed any other married women besides mom? I guess a guy could get in a lot of trouble doing that, huh?"" ---> ""He sure could {smiling}."" .... Watch for Phyllis Coates (the first ""Lois Lane"" on the ""Superman"" TV series) in this episode. When she plants a kiss on Beaver's cheek, all heck breaks loose!

6. ""Brotherly Love"" (November 8, 1957)

7. ""Water, Anyone?"" (November 15, 1957) -- ""He's got a monopoly; he's practically operating a 'black water' market.""

8. ""Beaver's Crush"" (November 22, 1957)

9. ""The Clubhouse"" (November 29, 1957)

10. ""Wally's Girl Trouble"" (December 6, 1957) -- This episode features Penny Jamison's hysterical scream (double meaning there) after Beaver gives Penny a toad as a gift. Penny's ear-piercing cries of anguish send Beaver running for the hills. ~LOL!~

11. ""Beaver's Short Pants"" (December 13, 1957) -- Aunt Martha's visit means nothing but misery and suffering for poor Beaver. .... ""Theodore -- don't slump over your milk toast like that; you'll have curvature of the spine!"" :-)

12. ""The Perfume Salesmen"" (December 27, 1957) -- The boys try to peddle 24 bottles of awful-smelling perfume. .... ""It kind of smells like an old first baseman's mitt I used to have.""

13. ""Voodoo Magic"" (January 3, 1958) -- A fabulous episode in the LITB annals. Many hilarious moments, including the following quote by June. .... ""George {Haskell}, I just can't believe this {about the ""voodoo curse"" Beaver put on Eddie}. The Beaver is such a sweet little fellow. He likes everybody -- even Eddie!""

14. ""Part-Time Genius"" (January 10, 1958) -- ""I think I'd like to be a garbage collector when I grow up. You don't have to wash your hands all the time, and nobody cares how you smell!"" :-)

15. ""Party Invitation"" (January 17, 1958) -- Beaver is forced to attend an ""all-girl"" party. (God help the lad!) :-)

16. ""Lumpy Rutherford"" (January 24, 1958) -- This is the rib-tickling ""Barrel Hoops"" episode, with Wally & Beaver setting a ""trap"" for mean ol' ""Lumpy"" just outside his house. But Lumpy's father falls into the trap instead of ""The Lump"". .... June's excitedly-worried reaction to the boys' practical joke elicits another classic bit of dialogue from this great TV series --- ""Ward, if my babies go to jail, it's going to be all your fault!!""

17. ""The Paper Route"" (January 31, 1958)

18. ""Child Care"" (February 7, 1958) -- It's yet another funny predicament for Wally & The Beav, when the boys are called upon to baby-sit while Ward and June go to a party. The boys have to call the fire department to extract young ""Puddin'"" from the bathroom she's managed to lock herself into. .... ""I want to see Mary Jane!!""

19. ""The Bank Account"" (February 14, 1958) -- This one's a real heart-tugger, as Wally and Beaver surprise their father with a very special gift.

20. ""Lonesome Beaver"" (February 28, 1958)

21. ""Cleaning Up Beaver"" (March 7, 1958)

22. ""The Perfect Father"" (March 14, 1958) -- ""Oh, for Pete sake! I just put it up {the basketball backboard} for them to fool around with; I didn't think they were going to put a micrometer on it!"" --- The early-season shows feature several ""Ward tantrums"", with this being one such funny example. Hugh Beaumont, as Ward Cleaver, was ""The Perfect Father"" choice for this TV series, if ya ask me. :)

23. ""Beaver And Poncho"" (March 21, 1958) -- Another ""lump-in-your-throat"" type of episode, with Beaver adopting the cutest little Chihuahua dog for a few days. .... ""Wally says he's a bald-headed Mexican.""

24. ""The State Vs. Beaver"" (March 26, 1958)

25. ""The Broken Window"" (April 2, 1958)

26. ""Train Trip"" (April 9, 1958)

27. ""My Brother's Girl"" (April 16, 1958) -- ""As a woman, I'm very proud of Mary Ellen! Why, if we women waited until you men were good and ready to settle down and raise families, this whole continent of America would be nothing but buffaloes, jack-rabbits, and grizzly bears!!"" --- June gets in some good wisecracks of her own upon occasion (as can be seen here). :-)

28. ""Next-Door Indians"" (April 23, 1958)

29. ""Tenting Tonight"" (April 30, 1958) -- The boys' 6-hour-long session at the movie theater sparks some quintessential angry ""Ward-isms"" in this episode. ... ""You spent over six hours today sitting in that stuffy movie theater!!"" ---> ""Yeah, they sure give ya a lot for your 35 cents, don't they?""

30. ""Music Lesson"" (May 7, 1958)

31. ""New Doctor"" (May 14, 1958)

32. ""Beaver's Old Friend"" (May 21, 1958)

33. ""Wally's Job"" (May 28, 1958) -- The non-complex stories continue (with more funny results) in this episode about, quite simply, painting the family garbage cans.

34. ""Beaver's Bad Day"" (June 4, 1958) -- Again, here we have another example of a super-simple premise (Beaver rips his pants; EGADS!), which rises to a very funny level in the hands of this adept cast. Ward's angry reaction when he thinks Beaver is feeding him a tall tale is a highlight here.

35. ""Boarding School"" (June 11, 1958)

36. ""Beaver And Henry"" (June 18, 1958) -- ""I hardly think that 'Henry' is the proper name for a rabbit in HER condition."" ;)

37. ""Beaver Runs Away"" (June 25, 1958) -- Another fine example of a LITB ep. that combines comedy with a healthy dose of sentimentality as well. Beaver drills two holes in the garage wall, which, naturally, displeases Ward quite a bit. Beaver decides to pack up and leave home after a run-in with his dad. The final scene here is quite touching and realistically portrayed.

38. ""Beaver's Guest"" (July 2, 1958) -- Beaver's best pal, Larry Mondello, stays overnight at the Cleaver abode. His visit is marred by a fight with Beaver and Larry's middle-of-the-night stomach ache that keeps the whole house awake half the night. .... ""Oh, the way that boy ate! It was like watching a mongoose! I don't think I've ever seen anyone eat ketchup on corn before."" :-)

39. ""Cat Out Of The Bag"" (July 16, 1958) -- Season 1 ends with the boys getting into still more hot water when they lose the neighbor's cat that they're supposed to be looking after. .... ""Gee, dad, you're always saying I'm old enough to take care of 'The Beaver'. It shouldn't matter just because the cat is worth something."" :-)

-----------------------

Closing Cleaver Comments........

""Leave It To Beaver"" is an American institution. Although extremely simple and unsophisticated in nature, the show never fails to entertain. And the entertainment value of the series' first season is increased many times over thanks to the high quality of these DVDs.

Gripes against the Lunch-Box packaging notwithstanding,  the first season of LITB on DVD is unquestionably a mandatory purchase for fans of that TV series. And I think it's safe to say even that ever-perfect of all moms, June Cleaver, would be more than happy to give this DVD collection her very own (and much sought-after) ""Cleaver Seal Of Approval"".

I think possibly the thing I treasure the most about having a ""Leave It To Beaver"" full-season DVD set like this one available is the ""It's Always Gonna Be There"" factor. That is to say -- just knowing that I can revisit Mayfield and the Cleaver gang anytime of the day or night by simply popping in one of these discs is ... well ... kind of a comforting thought in and of itself.",1132790400,308,26406,4.860770773000668

--------------------------------------------------

""Leave It To Beaver"" (1957-1963) is one of my all-time favorite television programs, and I'm thrilled to now have the opportunity to collect the series on the DVD format. It's a TV show that, for me, never grows old or tiresome. Wally, Ward, June, Eddie, Lumpy, and ""The Beav"" will always be welcome on my TV screen.

This ""Limited Edition"" Lunch Box version of ""Leave It To Beaver: The Complete First Season"" is both fantastic and a nightmare at the same time. The ""fantastic"" part is the TV show itself (and the three discs which have all 39 first-year Beaver entries on them....and the quality is excellent here).

The ""nightmare"" part has to do with the way the discs are stored within the Lunch Box, plus the complete and utter lack of ANY printed episode information inside this package whatsoever. No episode guide booklet. Not even a single-page insert with the ep. titles scribbled on them someplace. Nothing. That's just plain crazy.

Via this ""Premium"" pack, the only way to find a specific episode you want to view is to physically load up a disc and then search for the program via the Episode Index on the DVD itself. Either that or print out the episode information yourself from an online episode guide or some other source. I guess that WOULD actually be a good idea for people who buy this Limited set.

In fact, with the best interests of Beaver fans in mind, I'll provide a quick-reference, disc-by-disc, Season-One episode guide near the end of this review. And if anyone should desire to do so, they can easily copy-and-paste the program list below into ""Word Pad"" (or some similar type of computer word processor), and then print out a copy to put in the Lunch Box for future Beaver reference.

Offhand, I cannot think of one other TV-on-DVD product that doesn't come with some kind of program guide, either printed on the box or on an insert/booklet. I certainly don't own a similar such set anyway.

The three discs in this set are afforded a very cheap Lunch-Box home, with each one being slid into a CD-like plastic sleeve which comprise the first ""pages"" of the bonus item here, a ""Cleaver Family Photo Album"". The album is a pretty nice supplementary item, with six B&W pictures of the Cleavers (plus Eddie Haskell) placed into sleeves within the album (same type of sleeves that hold the discs).

But, for what's labelled as a ""Premium Edition Gift Set"" by Universal Home Video, I would have expected a much better disc-storing device than just these album sleeves. Sliding them in and out of sleeves could possibly result in the discs getting scratched more easily. Plus, to get the things out of the sleeves, you pretty much have no choice but to touch some portions of the data sides of the DVDs, which isn't too good of an idea either.

If only Universal would have made the Lunch Box a tad bigger, they could have easily put the ""Standard Edition"" of the LITB set inside the Lunch Box, which would have been the best of both packaging worlds -- i.e., a ""Limited Edition"", but with normal (and better) DVD cases/trays, which the Standard version does contain. The Lunch Box measures 7.75 in. x 6 in., with a thickness of about 3 inches.

The regular/standard edition comes in a nice-looking white slipcase box, which holds three individual slim cases for the DVDs. And, of course, that edition also has episode information written on the back of the cases (plus ""DVD specifications"" such as video aspect ratio stats, Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, subtitle options, etc., which is also data that is completely absent from the Limited Edition set).

So, I'd advise fans of this charming and ultra-likeable TV sitcom to go with the ""Standard"" version of LITB Season 1. It has much better packaging for the double-sided DVDs. I might also add that three of the six photos contained in the Limited Edition's Photo Album can also be found in the Standard pack (with those same 3 pics being shown on the back covers of the three slim plastic cases).

Packaging devices aside, I'm extremely pleased with the overall video and audio quality of these DVDs. The Cleaver clan looks just terrific here. It appears to me that Universal Studios has done a marvelous job of transferring these nearly half-century-old TV episodes (which were shot on film, not videotape) to the DVD format. The original ""wet cement"" opening titles appear on each of these 39 episodes, as do the ""teasers"" (i.e., prologues/trailers) that originally aired during these shows just prior to the opening credits. Thank you, Universal, for presenting these programs unedited in any fashion; the average run time here looks to be about 25.5 minutes, which is excellent (in an ""uncut"" sort of way). ;)

And Universal has even seen fit to include the ""Pilot"" episode (""It's A Small World"") in this Beaver collection as well (it's located on Side B of Disc #3). The pilot, which was first broadcast in April 1957 as an installment of the syndicated ""Studio 57"" TV series, is a good program too (IMHO), and provides a very satisfactory start to the LITB series (although I must admit that Casey Adams, who portrayed Ward Cleaver in the pilot, doesn't nearly exhibit the charm, likability, and overall greatness that Hugh Beaumont brought to the role in the actual LITB series). Very nice DVD picture quality for the pilot too.

Here now is that episode list I promised earlier. For providing the following info that Universal should have included in this Lunch-Box pack in the first place, but didn't, I accept personal checks and most major credit cards. (Just kidding, Beaver fans. ~devilish grin~).......

Closing Comments........

I've always looked upon the ""Leave It To Beaver"" TV series as an American institution of sorts. Its scripts and storylines were always very simple in nature, but the show never has failed to make me smile. And the entertainment value of the series' inaugural season is increased many times over thanks to the high quality of these DVDs.

Even with my many gripes concerning the Lunch-Box packaging, the first season of ""Leave It To Beaver"" on DVD is unquestionably an obligatory purchase for fans of this fun television show.

I'd strongly suggest getting the Standard Edition set, however, instead of this Limited Edition pack. And even though I dislike multiple things about the Lunch-Box set, I still feel the need to heap some praise and compliments upon Universal Studios for giving consumers a choice here, and for not releasing LITB Season 1 in JUST the Lunch Box. For being provided a choice of Beaver sets, I salute Universal proudly.",1132790400,141,8301,4.845120226308345
2404900,5,B000B7HZUK,"As a young kid during the later half of the 1950's, I didn't see the orginal airing of the show. Like most people, I only

saw LITB.in syndication.

 But I enjoyed the series very much. Even if it didn't reflex

what real family life was like in the 1950's.

 There will be a lot of episodes to watch, should Univeral come out with all six seasons. One question I do have about the release on dvd. Will any of the episodes that featured actor

Harrison Ford be released?

 He appeared on the show during the last few episodes of the

sixth season. But because the show was in syndication for

long. Some of those episodes were lost. And it has now become an

urban myth as to whether those last episode exsisted or not!

 Anyway buy the first season set of Leave it to Beaver.

It a wonderful and enjoyable piece of 50's tv nostalia.",1132704000,6,833,4.283870967741936
2404901,3,B000B7HZUK,"I recommend purchasing the standard set, not the ""limited edition"" collectors version.  The lunch box is cool enough, but the DVDs are housed in a cheap plastic ""photo album"", which will, no doubt, yellow with age (looks like PVC, which is notorious for aging).  The ""photo album"" doesn't stand up buy itself and doesn't physically ""fit in"" very well with a DVD collection. Would have been much better if they had just put the standard boxed set in the lunchbox.  (There is also a large piece of styrofoam in the lunchbox.  Classy.)  The DVDs themselves are excellent and any LITB fan will be thrilled.",1132617600,57,602,4.75
2404902,1,B000B7HZUK,"Why does Universal have to own the rights to all the really good stuff?  The Munsters, the classic Monster films of the 30s and 40s, and now Leave it to Beaver. I agree with the previous reviewer -- Double sided discs are a pathetic excuse in this day and age, especially for a show that kids will undoubtedly be loading and unloading from the DVD player themselves.  Just look at the recently released Adventures of Superman for an beautfiful example fo how a classic television show from the 50s should be released -- singlesided picture discs, commentaries, bonus features.  I have been waiting for Leave it To Beaver on DVD for years and will obviously purchase it -- but with my teeth clenched in frustration over the cheapskates at Universal DVD.",1132358400,33,752,4.7251908396946565
2404903,1,B000B7HZUK,"I've been waiting months for this DVD set of the first season of Leave it to Beaver to be released. Now that there is only one week to go I'm a little apprehensive about buying it so fast. I've bought other TV series on DVD and was pleased with what I saw. Will the same be true for this set?

For one thing, the discs are going to be double-sided. I have never seen this on other series I have bought in the past. Movies, yes but TV series no. I have to wonder if the quality is going to suffer because of it.

A bigger question: Since the discs are double-sided, does it mean they were trying to cut down on space? That might mean the episodes are cut.

Sadly, if the episodes are cut I'll have to stick to watching the reruns on TV. Universal knows the series is popular, give the fans of it what they deserve, you know we'll buy it.

Uncut, clear picture episodes are what I would like, extras would  be even better!",1132012800,14,920,4.11731843575419
2404904,5,B000B7HZUK,"Thank you Universal for releasing Leave It To Beaver on DVD. Let's hope these are the uncut episodes with Hugh Beaumont's introduction in each of the 39 episodes. This would be a wonderful gift for the Beaver fans in your family. It's been one of my favorite shows. No controversy, no vulgarity,just good clean fun with the Cleavers and the whole gang. I hope you will be satisfied with this effort!!",1132012800,7,400,4.647887323943662
2404905,5,B000B7HZUK,"Wally's typical back home from school announcment. Ah, the Cleaver household; one in which I lived growing up in the 1950s...loved them, esp Wally, Beaver and my favorite of all, Larry Mondello. They were all so NATURAL; a FAR cry from most of today's hip-slick-sitcom-kids. They were the real deal; every single one. But somehow Larry appealed to me the most of Beaver's friends. His blue jeans (dungarees back then) with the 18 inch cuff rolled up, his cap and his ever-present whining and insatiable appetite, and of course, Mrs Mondello (she always seemed to be wearing a hat and gloves, even in her own house!) who always went to Ward when Larry acted up: ""He always does this when his father's away and I just don't know what to do with him Mr. Cleaver! Will you talk to him? He'll listen to you.""

I liked Eddie Haskell, and Lumpy (a friend of mine was in Palm Springs CA once and saw him driving around with a license plate that read ""I'm Lumpy"") but didn't care much for the assorted girl friends, with one or two exceptions; too giggly and conniving.

And Beaver's older friends, later in the show, Whitey and Gilbert were not anywhere near as appealing as Larry, IMO.

Ward and June were great; how I wanted to move into the Cleaver household! Just gave me a feeling that nothing could ever hurt or harm me if I was under their roof.

When you watch them today, as adults, you realize how vastly superior all the actors were then; a real window into their world, not a stage set with people playing parts.

The single show since LITB that rang true (again, IMO) was Roseanne. LOVED those kids, esp Sara Gilbert.

One thing always puzzled me; why on earth did they have the Cleavers move? I loved the original clapboard house with all the windows; the newer house just wasn't the same, and then it was used in Marcus Welby MD and others.

Oh well, again, thank God we can revisit the Cleaver household and go back to a softer, less complicated time...sometimes you CAN go home again.",1130803200,12,1993,4.519444444444445
2404906,5,B000B7HZUK,"It is so exciting to have the complete first season of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER hitting DVD boxed set on November 22nd.  It has always been my favorite TV series of all time and the one with the fondest place in my heart.  Too dark and serious to be called a comedy, and too light and funny at other times to be a drama, BEAVER is probably best termed a ""dramedy"", a term I loathe.  Like life itself, it can be by turns funny and dramatic, light and tragic.

BEAVER comes from a more quiet and gentle era, despite its always offensive laugh track.  Today's sitcoms are filmed on sound stages with studio audiences.  I can remember this being the trend back to when I was part of a 1975 studio audience for ONE DAY AT A TIME.  By contrast, BEAVER was filmed all over Universal City's backlot to give it an anywhere USA town reality.  I grew up in a town a lot like Mayfield.  Considering that the Bates Motel was in use for PSYCHO (1960) during one BEAVER season, while 1930's Georgia was being re-created for TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962) during another season, let's give the BEAVER production designers and set decorators a lot of credit here.  To watch BEAVER is to literally watch my childhood unfold in the small town era 1960's suburbs south of San Francisco.

The cast is so immortal here.  Jerry Mathers IS Beaver Cleaver, as are Tony Dow as his older brother Wally, Barbara Billingsley as the much-maligned Mom (if vacuuming the house in pearls is her ""thing"", so be it), Hugh Beaumont as Dad, Frank Bank as Lumpy Rutherford, Rusty Stevens as Beav's best friend Larry (remember the way he always reached for a Cleaver dining table apple), and especially Sue Randall as the lovely Miss Landers (what child would not have a crush on HER?) and Ken Osmond as the incomparable con man Eddie Haskell.  They all live their roles, and I knew people in elementary and junior high who were just like all of them.

But most of all, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is probably always going to be my favorite TV show of all time is because of the reality and truthfulness in its conflicts and dialogue.  Most of the teleplays are by creators Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher.  It have heard that, between them, Connelly and Mosher had a dozen or more relatives, nephews, and nieces the ages of the show's characters.  They were unofficial story editors to Mosher and Connelly on what rang true to life, and what did not, to these kids.

When the sublime season one of BEAVER hits DVD on November 22nd, it will be a dream come true for me.  Uncut and non-commercial and remastered--whoa.  Let's also hope they are in correct chronological order so that we can watch the characters grow, and that the minute-long prologues spoken by Hugh Beaumont are included.  Here's watching and waiting and hoping with this matchless series.",1128384000,14,2797,4.542914171656687

2404908,5,B000B7HZUK,I have loved this show since I was a little kid. I'm now 50 and still love it. I have been waiting for the DVD so I can ditch my out of sequence and inferior VHS that I taped from T.V. with commercials intact. Yuk.

8082803,4,B000B7HZUK,"If you're a Baby Boomer of a certain age almost certainly you grew up watching ""Leave it to Beaver"" in glorious black & white on television.  Premiering in the late 50's LITB is a slice of Americana from the Eisenhower era.  Quaint best describes this family of 4 in their modest home, one car, and upright values when you compare it to how things are today.

  Young second grader Theodore ""Beaver"" Cleaver (Jerry Mathers) is the titular star and the show follows him through daily adventures when there were no so-called helicopter parents and kids went outdoors in their neighborhoods (without fear of abduction or worse) and played with one another (no video games, social media) in person and even got into mischief.  The core cast is great, perpetual suit wearing father Ward (Hugh Beaumont), apron and pearl wearing mom June (Barbara Billingsley) and older brother Wally (Tony Dow) round out the ensemble in each episode helping 'The Beaver' learn many life lessons.  The supporting cast of young actors is quite good as well and stand out Ken Osmond as the smarmy suck-up Eddie Haskell is teriffic.  So, if you're looking for a nostalgic trip back to a simpler time visitng 'Beave' and his pals will likely bring a smile to your face.",1499472000,3,1242,4.7981220657277
