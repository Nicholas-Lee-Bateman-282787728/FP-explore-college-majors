8626254,3,6305020736,"I've been told that ""First Option"" which was directed by Gordan Chan was horrible. This time he produces in ""Option Zero."" The plot consists of a special branch of the HK police known as SB. After one  of their members is killed, the group disbands, and three of the members  try out for an elite group known as G4. First of all, I thought that the  plot was loose, and that the ending was abrupt. I didn't mind the element  of love that was added in between the star Cheung Chi Lam, his girlfriend  Carman Lee, and a member of SB Monica Chan (who is secretly in love with  him). There were so many things that should've been expanded on, such as  the ending. G4 takes up about the last 20 minutes or so. The cinematography  was off in a few scenes, which made me feel lost. What this movie needed  was gun fight scenes John Woo style!",931737600,3,835,4.234177215189874
