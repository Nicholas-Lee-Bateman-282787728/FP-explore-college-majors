4686164,3,B005FWO35Q,"easy, sweet love story.  It says 2015 but this show was actually made in 2010. Dean Cain looked to young to be 49, but he was still around 42 or so when this movie was actally made.  He still looked young for that age.  Acting was not to bad.  Cute dog.",1513382400,,253,3.9019607843137254

4686166,5,B005FWO35Q,"I've watched this movie seveal times.  This. to me, is an amusing, enjoyable and entertaining movie - it keeps my interest even after several viewings. Good staring actors and a good supporting cast. It is what I'd call a romantic comedy. HEY, AMAZON, MORE LIKE THIS MOVIE FORMAT, PLEASE. If asked, this is a move I can recommend others to watch. Give it a try - I think you'll like it.",1510704000,,386,4.436619718309859
4686167,2,B005FWO35Q,well - hum - what to say - dumbfounded - could have been better - most certainly could have been worse - but how does she keep house and pay off 500k - (the end window epilogue eludes to completion) anywho - time better spent looking elsewhere,1509494400,,243,4.191489361702128

4686169,2,B005FWO35Q,Saw the trailer's for this movie and it looks really idiotic and NOT worth the price of $19.99 which way too much money.. Don't waste your money!!!,1508803200,,147,4.481481481481482
4686170,5,B005FWO35Q,"Great movie.  A little bit cheesy and predictable, but with subtle side stories that made it fun to watch.  A great flick for a night on the couch with someone you love.  Easy to enjoy when you are in a lighthearted mood.",1508198400,,221,4.214285714285714
4686171,1,B005FWO35Q,Painful.  Simply too hard to watch; sound and quality like a 1972 flick.  ouch.,1508025600,,79,4.571428571428571

4686193,1,B005FWO35Q,"Ok so taking away the fact that this is a ""C"", trying to be a ""B"", movie this is just not in good taste. I would assume that this is supposed to be a family movie? It feels like who ever wrote it never made it out of their parents basement. I can't believe that somebody actually though that this was good enough to direct and produce. I love Dean Cane but this is pure garbage.. Do no not waste your time!!",1506211200,,407,3.975609756097561
4686194,2,B005FWO35Q,"I kept watching, I guess hoping it would get better. Main actor either doesn't know how to act, or the director was horrible. Over played and fake looking. Other than that it was a movie I might have enjoyed.",1505260800,,208,4.358974358974359

4686196,2,B005FWO35Q,I thought it would be a nice background movie but it was a bit slow and each 'next happening' was very obvious.  The plot is not very much.  The mix of portoguese spoken too fast was hard to follow even to read the subtitles.  Situations were simplistic and expected that was no fun to watch.  Acting was light.,1501545600,2,311,4.310344827586207
4686197,5,B005FWO35Q,I loved it!!  defnitely a chick flick!!!,1500854400,,40,4.714285714285714

4686199,5,B005FWO35Q,I really did enjoy it! It was fun and quirky.,1498780800,,45,3.6
4686200,3,B005FWO35Q,"This is a pleasant enough romantic comedy. Contrary to the Amazon credits as I write this, it stars Juliana Paes who is a steamy Brazilian actress. Jamie Anderson appears ever so briefly and definitely is not a lead in the film.

I can't say that either Dean Cain or Juliana Paes shine in their acting. The film plays mostly off of the steam of Paes although there is a fair amount of romance between her and Dean Cain's character. Add a bit of comedy and there you have it.

There isn't anything in this that would require editing for mainstream American TV censorship.",1497052800,2,570,4.524271844660194

4686213,2,B005FWO35Q,This is a predictable Hallmark Channel style movie.  The only credible actor was the dog.,1491523200,,89,4.933333333333334

4686216,4,B005FWO35Q,"This was a cute, if not slightly predictable, romance. Very cozy and easy watching, although I was (pleasantly) surprised by various sexual references throughout the movie, whether it be about someone's sexuality or the couple in the bed and breakfast actually having sex pretty much the entire time. The chemistry between the 2 main leads was believable. Bill Engvall and the actress playing Maria stole the movie.",1489190400,,415,5.208955223880597
4686217,3,B005FWO35Q,It was just ok.,1489104000,,15,3.0
4686218,2,B005FWO35Q,Cheesy and predictable.  I knew the resolution the moment the two main characters met. There was  no real conflict or problem to solve. The acting was poor and even the background music was silly.,1488758400,,196,4.735294117647059
4686219,5,B005FWO35Q,Simple rom-com and simply charming for putting a happy-ending-smile on your face after the end of a long day. I like the chemistry between the main characters and the cute quirks of the rest of the cast.,1488758400,2,203,4.513513513513513
4686220,4,B005FWO35Q,"Cute movie. A nice movie to just unwind with. Decent, somewhat charming, story line. I liked the house, the fixing it up. Gave a Under the Tuscan Sun feel. Could had even relied more on that, even had the vineyards in the movie and such. I liked the two main characters and felt the parts were well acted. I've always had a crush on Dean Cain. The secondary characters, though done in humor, were a bit over the top. I also felt it could had ended a little better. Though it does give you the blessedly wonderful, even if typical, happy ending, I still felt there was a few lose ends. Overall, worth the watch.",1487462400,,610,4.3130434782608695

However, with the all the emphasis on sex in this movie, it makes me wonder about their lack of confidence and/ or creative abilities for this movie without it. What producers may try and resonate as entertainment, I just get a sense of a lack of creativity and confidence, whether in the characters, the story or worse in their actors abilities to make an entertaining movie with out it. This is why I gave this movie only one star.",1484524800,4,588,4.3545454545454545
