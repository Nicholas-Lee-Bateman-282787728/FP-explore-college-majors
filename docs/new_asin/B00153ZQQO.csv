3140109,3,B00153ZQQO,Our little boy doesn't get to see this type of engine very often.  He didn't seem very impressed by the work it was doing.  Much of the work was repetitive and not very interesting to him.,1392422400,,188,4.194444444444445

He loves the music and will stop whatever he is doing to listen.",1375142400,,175,4.5
3140113,1,B00153ZQQO,"My 2 year old loves tractors.  He loves tractor movies, toys, bikes, stickers, etc.  I bought this movie at the same time I bought the John Deere movie but the difference is that the John Deere movie keeps his attention.  He has watched the John Deere movie almost everyday since we bought it.

In contrast, he will start to watch this movie then get up and turn it off or walk away.  He won't watch it.

The voices used are annoying.  My husband tried to watch it the other day but eventually turned it off because he couldn't stand the voices.  It is a very boring movie.",1370390400,,573,4.289719626168225

3140118,5,B00153ZQQO,"This is a really good mighty machines to add to any collection or to start one. Our kids 2 & 5 have been watching this one for over a year now and they still request it. On the Farm, At the Sawmill and Deep Underground are the episodes. They are very intersting to watch. The DVD ""Winter Blast"" has the episode that goes with At the Sawmill, the espisode is In the Forest and it is a great way to learn the whole story! Our son would have never known he wanted to harvest trees when he grows up without these DVD's!",1358035200,,515,4.0588235294117645

3140124,4,B00153ZQQO,"My 16 month old son loves tractors. He watches the ""On the Farm"" episode over and over. I just wish that there were more tractor episodes on the DVD.",1345852800,,149,4.172413793103448
3140125,4,B00153ZQQO,"The first section about the sawmill is very corny and my 2yr old refuses to watch it. However, he loves the farm and I think the mines are very interesting. Overall I think they are a little long to engage young children, but they shouldn't really be watching that much TV anyway. I would prefer, and I think my son would as well, not to have the narrative but just the sounds of the machines working, but I understand it increases the educational value. Overall I think this is a decent dvd.",1342310400,,492,4.358695652173913
3140126,5,B00153ZQQO,"This is a kids DVD that will hold their attention the full 90 minutes. The child will learn a lot and have fun at it! Since watching these DVDs a LOT of times my nephews talk about them frequently. While not really a movie for grown ups, kids love it and ask to watch it many times over.",1341360000,,287,3.9655172413793105
3140127,5,B00153ZQQO,I have a 4 year old daughter and a 3 year old son.  Both of my children absolutely love this DVD.  They ask for it at least once a day!  I'm now looking for other DVD's in the series so that we will have a variety so I don't have to watch the same one all the time!,1339459200,,265,3.5344827586206895
3140128,5,B00153ZQQO,We love Mighty Machines in our house!  It is one DVD we don't get tired of watching over and over again!,1338768000,,104,3.9523809523809526
3140140,4,B00153ZQQO,"We have both of the Mighty Machines power pack DVDs and needed something new to supplement my 3 yr old son's fascination with trucks, tractors, planes, etc.  They are entertaining for 2-5 year olds and you (as the adult) won't feel your brain being sucked dry if you are required to watch them, like some kid's programming.  A suggestion: make a list of what's on each DVD and keep it handy by your stash so you won't struggle to find the right one putting in DVD after DVD--it's too hard to remember which episode is on which DVD when pushed for time.",1333670400,,552,4.401960784313726
3140141,4,B00153ZQQO,"My four year old son is obsessed with tractors, bulldozers, trucks, and pretty much anything else that rolls on wheels.  I had never heard of this series until the other day, when I saw this DVD available at my local library.  It was like finding a treasure!  My son loved it, and I ended up learning something too.  (It's always a bonus when the producers of children's shows can also entertain adults, so kudos to the people at NCircle Entertainment for their efforts!)
There are 3 primary episodes on this DVD:  1) AT THE SAWMILL! 2) ON THE FARM! 3) DEEP UNDERGROUND! (This 3rd episode actually introduces the viewer to the industrial process of mining salt, deep in underground caverns below Lake Huron.)  Via a dubbed-in narrative, all of the vehicles are ""anthropomorphized"" and given distinct names, personalities, and voices.  A previous reviewer mentioned being annoyed by all of the different accented voices associated with the vehicles; admittedly I can relate a little bit to this. (I did initially start laughing at the opening scene of AT THE SAWMILL, when I heard the dubbed-in voice of a gruff sounding female saying ""Hello kids! My name is JAWS!"" - the ""character"" for the front-end loader filmed in the process of hauling logs.)  However, once I made the mental adjustment to the voice-over format, I was pleasantly surprised by the wealth of information that was presented.  As for my son, this DVD kept his undivided attention (a rarity) for the full 90 minute duration.  He even enjoyed the ""Mighty Machines"" jingle that played between each episode (subsequently singing it at the dinner table.)

I intend to purchase a copy of this DVD, and to also check out additional episodes in this series.

As I said initially - if your kids like vehicles, they'll most likely enjoy this DVD.",1328486400,2,1804,4.859477124183006
3140142,5,B00153ZQQO,"Excellent product - What a fun experience for my girlfriends son, Kole - he is mesmerized with ""BIG TRUCKS"" and the videos are amazing.",1318377600,,135,4.666666666666667
3140143,5,B00153ZQQO,"Our 18 month old son loves the Mighty Machine series of videos! We own six of them, some are better than others, but all of them keep him entertained.",1313366400,,150,4.206896551724138
3140144,5,B00153ZQQO,"We received this DVD so quickly after ordering it, my son was able to start watching within a few days of ordering it. I highly recommend this product and company!",1296172800,,163,4.466666666666667
3140145,4,B00153ZQQO,"My toddler grandson loves tractors.  This DVD has a feature on tractors along with other working vehicles.  He loves this whole series.

For some reason the makers of this video think all machines need to talk in accented voices.  As an adult, I find it annoying.  But I'm not the target audience, either.",1294876800,,305,4.679245283018868
3140146,5,B00153ZQQO,"Great video for my 3 year old! He plays it over and over again! It has 3 sections; On the Farm (tractors, combines), At the Sawmill (logs, lumber) and Deep Underground (in a salt mine).  All sections are fun, educational and include a lot of heavy equipment! Highly recommended!",1290643200,,278,4.673469387755102
3140147,5,B00153ZQQO,"Since the Amazon page doesn't give much information about this particular Mighty Machines DVD, I figured that I'd post the blurb that's on the back of its box:

""Meet Buzz, Stretch, and Ranger!  These Tremendous Tools have one thing in common - they know how to work hard and get the job done!

There's so much work to be done on the farm - you need a barnyard brigade!  Allis Tractor, Polly the Plow and Haybine team up to make hay, while Stretch works his magic to make the hay dry.

Meanwhile, Mighty Machines are buzzing around the sawmill where Jaws the front-end loader shows trees turned into lumber.  Jaws may do the heavy lifting, but he gets by with a little help from his friends, Buzz, Scoop, and Big Red.

Mighty Machines are also needed deep underground, where they tunnel into a salt mine!  Ranger, Driller and Crusher not only find the salt, they scoop it up and carry it back to the surface.  Dig it!""

These Mighty Machines DVDs are magic to 2 year old boys (not to mention their 5 year old sisters).  I've watched my nephew watch them daily, and with each viewing he pays more and more attention to each one.  I can see him processing and learning what he sees.  At first he just watched the DVDs raptly; now he starts calling out the names of the different machines and telling me what they are doing.  He's so serious when he tells me what each machine does - so cute!  And I have to say, I've actually learned some things too.  Personally, I'd rather he be parked in front of one of these DVDs than a lot of the others that are out there supposedly aimed at children, because he takes what he learns and applies it to the machines he sees in real life.  He doesn't just see a machine, he knows what it does and where it goes.  That may not seem like much, but that interest in objects carries over into other things in his life,  which is a very good thing.",1286409600,66,1879,4.301994301994302
3140148,5,B00153ZQQO,These are great for little kids who love to know how all this stuff works...You know like how do the bales of hay get round?  Totally recommend but the songs will get stuck in your head...and you will be humming it...Even Grandpa,1281312000,,229,4.4523809523809526

3140160,5,B00153ZQQO,"Like I reported before, I purchased 3 dvds for my 3 year-old grandson and he was mesermized by them.  I think the Garbage recycling truck was his favorite.  We continue to have prompt service from Amazon and thank them for that service.  This is how I keep in touch with my grandkids and it is very important to me.",1276128000,,315,4.305084745762712

3140164,5,B00153ZQQO,"We purchased this Mighty Machine dvd and also have 3 others.  Our two year old son likes them all.  Whoever came up with the idea of filming a construction site or farming operation and then doing some silly voice overs was pretty smart.  If your child is into machinery, these movies will be a hit.  I've learned some new things about the equipment and I feel better about having my child watching these movies than most animation.  It's also fun to be driving down the road and your child points out a grapple and then tells you what it's used for.",1263686400,6,550,4.405940594059406
3140165,5,B00153ZQQO,"This was one of our 2 yr old sons favorites....in fact, he absolutely loved all of these except for the one about trains (apparently the wheels need to be showing in order for him to be happy).  All in all, its a very good purchase...most little boys will go for these.  The voices are interesting without being annoying.  Well worth the low price...I wouldnt have any sanity without Mighty Machines!",1250294400,,400,4.685714285714286

There is always one of them in their car, and near all the DVD players around the house. I would say that my grandson has watched one of the Mighty Machine DVD's at least once a day since his October birthday and it is now April! Very educational as well, without them even realizing it. They do a good job of breaking up the video so that the children do not become bored. It is something they could walk away from and then come back and not have to worry about missing a story line.",1238716800,7,603,4.162393162393163

3140169,3,B00153ZQQO,"My son received several of these for Christmas this year: Tremendous Tools,  Big Wheels Rollin', Roadways to Runways, Diggers & Dozers, and Lights & Ladders.

While I have learned a lot about all sorts of vehicles, these videos are honestly kind of dull and slow-moving.

For example, in Lights and Ladders, we meet all sorts of city worker vehicles-- like street sweepers and trash trucks.  At once point, we spend several minutes watching the trash ooze from the back of the truck and it deposits it before it gets put into a landfill.  It is very dull-- in fact my son will spend about 15 minutes watching then run off.  Mind you, this is a 90 minute video!

I was hoping these were the ones that sneak letters, numbers and shapes into the program, like veggies in a casserole, but they are not.",1231200000,4,798,4.538461538461538

He has watched the John Deere movie almost everyday since we bought it.

In contrast, he will start to watch this movie then get up and turn it off or walk away.  He won't watch it.

The voices used are annoying.  My husband tried to watch it the other day but eventually turned it off because he couldn't stand the voices.  It is a very boring movie.",1370390400,,573,4.289719626168225

I would prefer, and I think my son would as well, not to have the narrative but just the sounds of the machines working, but I understand it increases the educational value.

A suggestion: make a list of what's on each DVD and keep it handy by your stash so you won't struggle to find the right one putting in DVD after DVD--it's too hard to remember which episode is on which DVD when pushed for time.",1333670400,,552,4.401960784313726
3374638,4,B00153ZQQO,"My four year old son is obsessed with tractors, bulldozers, trucks, and pretty much anything else that rolls on wheels.  I had never heard of this series until the other day, when I saw this DVD available at my local library.  It was like finding a treasure!  My son loved it, and I ended up learning something too.  (It's always a bonus when the producers of children's shows can also entertain adults, so kudos to the people at NCircle Entertainment for their efforts!)
There are 3 primary episodes on this DVD:  1) AT THE SAWMILL! 2) ON THE FARM! 3) DEEP UNDERGROUND! (This 3rd episode actually introduces the viewer to the industrial process of mining salt, deep in underground caverns below Lake Huron.)  Via a dubbed-in narrative, all of the vehicles are ""anthropomorphized"" and given distinct names, personalities, and voices.  A previous reviewer mentioned being annoyed by all of the different accented voices associated with the vehicles; admittedly I can relate a little bit to this. (I did initially start laughing at the opening scene of AT THE SAWMILL, when I heard the dubbed-in voice of a gruff sounding female saying ""Hello kids! My name is JAWS!"" - the ""character"" for the front-end loader filmed in the process of hauling logs.)  However, once I made the mental adjustment to the voice-over format, I was pleasantly surprised by the wealth of information that was presented.  As for my son, this DVD kept his undivided attention (a rarity) for the full 90 minute duration.  He even enjoyed the ""Mighty Machines"" jingle that played between each episode (subsequently singing it at the dinner table.)

I intend to purchase a copy of this DVD, and to also check out additional episodes in this series.

As I said initially - if your kids like vehicles, they'll most likely enjoy this DVD.",1328486400,2,1804,4.859477124183006

Highly recommended!",1290643200,,278,4.673469387755102
3374644,5,B00153ZQQO,"Since the Amazon page doesn't give much information about this particular Mighty Machines DVD, I figured that I'd post the blurb that's on the back of its box:

""Meet Buzz, Stretch, and Ranger!  These Tremendous Tools have one thing in common - they know how to work hard and get the job done!

There's so much work to be done on the farm - you need a barnyard brigade!  Allis Tractor, Polly the Plow and Haybine team up to make hay, while Stretch works his magic to make the hay dry.

Meanwhile, Mighty Machines are buzzing around the sawmill where Jaws the front-end loader shows trees turned into lumber.  Jaws may do the heavy lifting, but he gets by with a little help from his friends, Buzz, Scoop, and Big Red.

Mighty Machines are also needed deep underground, where they tunnel into a salt mine!  Ranger, Driller and Crusher not only find the salt, they scoop it up and carry it back to the surface.  Dig it!""

These Mighty Machines DVDs are magic to 2 year old boys (not to mention their 5 year old sisters).  I've watched my nephew watch them daily, and with each viewing he pays more and more attention to each one.  I can see him processing and learning what he sees.  At first he just watched the DVDs raptly; now he starts calling out the names of the different machines and telling me what they are doing.  He's so serious when he tells me what each machine does - so cute!  And I have to say, I've actually learned some things too.  Personally, I'd rather he be parked in front of one of these DVDs than a lot of the others that are out there supposedly aimed at children, because he takes what he learns and applies it to the machines he sees in real life.  He doesn't just see a machine, he knows what it does and where it goes.  That may not seem like much, but that interest in objects carries over into other things in his life,  which is a very good thing.",1286409600,66,1879,4.301994301994302

If your child is into machinery, these movies will be a hit.  I've learned some new things about the equipment and I feel better about having my child watching these movies than most animation.

While I have learned a lot about all sorts of vehicles, these videos are honestly kind of dull and slow-moving.

For example, in Lights and Ladders, we meet all sorts of city worker vehicles-- like street sweepers and trash trucks.  At once point, we spend several minutes watching the trash ooze from the back of the truck and it deposits it before it gets put into a landfill.  It is very dull-- in fact my son will spend about 15 minutes watching then run off.  Mind you, this is a 90 minute video!

The best thing about this DVD is that it can hold the attention of an adult as well as a child.  The creators of the video added voice overs to each machine so each machine is able to describe exactly what their job/function is.  I have read several other reviews where people call the voices ""annoying"" but I think that these voices are the reason children love the video.  What child doesn't like to hear a story where the reader changes their voice for each character?

This video is entertaining to children and they don't even realize how much they are learning about each machine.  If you have a child that is interested in machines I would highly recommend this video.",1469750400,,950,4.388571428571429
