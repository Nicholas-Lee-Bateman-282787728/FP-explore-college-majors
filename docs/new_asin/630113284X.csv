316612,2,630113284X,"Okay, I've discovered the Worst Director Ever, bar none.  I've watched three of Hollywood b-movie veteran director Jean Yarbrough  recently (THE BRUTE MAN, THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG, and now HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE) and this is one bad-nasty awful director.  OTHG was a criminal waste of a veteran cast of character actors heading rapidly towards the sunset.  BRUTE MAN was exploitation unleavened with insight or humanity.  HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE is hick humor for those who find Don Knotts' movies too difficult to follow.  These films are monuments to blown opportunities, stagnant and unimaginative direction, comedy that makes us groan and horror that makes us laugh.

  Avoid the scenes with Basil Rathbone if at all possible.  It's apparent he'd suffered a stroke prior to this movie and his distinct enunciation is noticeably slurred, making it difficult for a fan to watch.  About the only highlights here are when the country music stars (Ferlin Husky and Merle Haggard, especially) strap on the guitars and sing.",1091750400,6,1033,5.2
316613,5,630113284X,"Hey ya'll. Yessa yessa, this film is scraping the bottom of the cider barrel. Although the voluptious 'Boots Malone' and the Oriental chick with the constant pearl necklace give some great eye candy, this film takes a nose dive shortly after the opening credits. I like the car though, it seems to have been made with over 30 handguns and rifles.
Not much to say here some country singers playing honest to goodness country entertainers wind up staying the night in a house that everyone in town believes is haunted. It's not, it's run by spies or something masterminded by the hot Asian chick, who also has Lou Chaney Jr. (aka The Wolf Man) as a henchman. There is also the skinny, corpse like dude who floats around the movie like a ghastly fart.
The directing is imaginative with the dream sequences. This movie also pulls in country acts by showing them on the television. Yeah right, way to break up a non-existant plot. Even if you like old time country Hee Haw music, this movie is a stretch.",1087776000,,999,4.58659217877095
316614,4,630113284X,"""Hillbillies in a Haunted House"" is a sequel to ""Las Vegas Hillbillies"" and is one of the most entertaining Country and Western monster musicals ever made. Ferlin Husky, Don Bowman, and Joi Lansing are an act on their way to the Nashville Jamboree who decide to spend the night in a haunted house, where they meet up with, among others, Linda Ho, Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney, a Gorilla, and best of all, the always cheery John Carradine. Along the way there are many country songs (including one truly dreadful number by Joi all about the history of gowns...) some of which are good, and some of which aren't. I loved ""The Cat Came Back"", and was amused by the extremely youthful Merle Haggard cameos.
There is a conspiracy involving an agency named M.O.T.H.E.R. and a villain named Dr. Fu. There is a guy in a gorilla suit (George Barrows, perhaps?) Best of all is the television broadcast that Jeepers watches to help him go to sleep in which the hilariously scowling faces of the villains haunt poor Jeepers while a bad C&W song is being performed. Needless to say, John Carradine wins the contest for chewing the scenery. His scowls and eyebrow twitches never fail to make me laugh. There are silly subplots about spies and the like, and homage is paid to Ed Wood in the 'timeless' day/night location shots (and continuity gaffes of positively Woodsian proportions.)
Finally arriving in Nashville, the last fifteen or so minutes of the film are good old C&W stage acts like Merle Haggard, Sonny James, Molly Bee, and Marcella Wright.
If you like Country music, particularly the vintage stuff, or you just like goofy, nonsensical movies that make you laugh, though sometimes you aren't sure why, this film is for you.",1087430400,15,1719,4.771812080536913
316615,5,630113284X,"Mix horror-greats Lon Chaney Jr. and John Carradine with the lovely Lansing and some good country music and you have a fun movie.  Thanks to miserably poor acting by Ferlin Huskey's sidekick (Huskey is no actor either), a man in a gorilla suit and continuity errors worse than ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" and the unintentional humor makes this much more fun.

Arriving in Sleepy Junction, they find nowhere to stay, except for the local haunted house. Unbeknownst to them, a group of nefarious spies has set up shop in the basement. This lugubrious gang consists of Dr. Himmel (John Carradine), Maximillian (Lon Chaney, jr.), Madame Wong (Linda Ho), Gregor (Basil Rathbone), and their go-rilla. More musical numbers ensue, sounding like they were recorded inside of an old refrigerator. Soon, spooky occurrences begin, causing our heroes to run about the house. Skeletons rattle and bats-on-strings bounce around. The go-rilla goes on a rampage. Meanwhile, the spies concoct their eeevil schemes. When the good guys and bad guys finally meet, all-out insanity takes place. Sort of. Well, okay, not really. At all. HIAHH is a comedy / horror / musical film from 1967.  As such, it's fairly putrid.

316773,3,630113284X,"This film has been released a few times on DVD and Amazon has a policy to combine all versions of a film together so I usually recommend in my reviews that you look at the date of the review (you can sort by ""Newest First""). My review is based on the 2013 issue by VCI. Before I get to the film, I want to say that- sadly - they have not remastered the print and there are still plenty of scratches, so if you like the film, there is no reason to ""upgrade"" and there are no bonus features.

That said, this film is - in my opinion - a real mess. Nearly everyone in it is ""slumming"". It's sort of a companion film to ""Las Vegas Hillbillys"" which also stars Ferlin Husky and a bunch of country performers as well as Jayne Mansfield and a ""singing"" Mamie Van Doren. This time the ""sex symbol"" who sings is Joi Lansing. At least van Doren could act sexy. Lansing is a waste.

Yes, as the package says there are 12 country songs here - one song twice by Husky (well lipsynched). The first occurs in the opening scene and another about half way through with Lansing smiling as he sings the ""sad"" song. The rest of the Country Music performers sang at the Nashville Jamboree scene that fills the last 15 minutes of the film. So, here's a tip: If you are getting this for the performances, use the ""Scene Selector"" and go directly to the one marked ""Nashville Jamboree"" and press play. You'll get 15 minutes of performances and saved an hour or so of your life.

Re-releasing this film - which was in their catalog for years - was one of VCI's few missteps.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

316774,5,630113284X,"The 60's were known for two things, entertainment wise, (1) really great music, and (2) plenty of low budget flics with very talented singers and aging Hollywood stars. This film contains both. Ferlin Husky is one of my favorite artists. Here he showcases not only his wonderful singing, but his acting abilities, without taking himself too seriously. It features Lon Chaney Jr. (Wolf Man-1941), and the great Basil Rathbone, who portrayed Sherlock Holmes in the late 30's and early 40's, in his last film appearance. Yes it's low-budget, but great, great music!",1363305600,,562,5.119565217391305

316779,2,630113284X,"Everybody has their own personal choice for the worst movie ever made, and ""Hillbillys in a Haunted House"" is mine.  So why 2 stars?  Because like so many other totally wretched films it has a strange sort of fascination...and because I believe you have to experience the worst before you can appreciate the good stuff.  Ferlin Husky, Joi Lansing (who's awful by an eyefull) and someone named Don Bowman play traveling country musicians who stumble upon a house so creepy looking that it might as well have ""HAUNTED"" in neon letters above it, and are forced to spend the night.  Inside are John Carradine (who breezes through this mess so casually that he calls other characters by the wrong names), Basil Rathbone, who is clearly having the worst day of his life, and Lon Chaney (who manages one good, incongruously chilling murder scene) as some sort of spies.  There is also a really terrible actress named Linda Ho as a Dragon Lady and a guy in a gorilla suit, since everyone knows that all haunted houses come complete with their own gorillas.  It might have been possible to pull off this sort of rubbish at Universal in the 1940s (with largely the same cast!), but for 1967 -- the year before ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" -- it's pretty pathetic.  And for film buffs, the spectacle of watching the obviously ailing Rathbone struggling through his last film role is downright painful --almost as painful as the performance of Ferlin Husky, who in an apparent tribute to Chaney, seems to turn into a howling werewolf whenever he goes for the high notes.  This film played mostly in the south upon release:  maybe it was intended as punishment for that seccession business a century earlier.",1111968000,2,1715,4.766891891891892
316780,4,630113284X,"Hackneyed plot, poor acting, dodgy songs, TERRIBLE miming to those songs and flat direction are all present in HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE, yet I just can't bring myself to hate this film.  Everything is just so sweet and niave, without a hint of malice about it.  Seeing Basil Rathbone slumming it made me gasp in horror, but he still tips the film over into 'acceptable' by his mere appearance.
A Country and Western duet and their nervous manager are on the way to the ""Nashville Jamboree"" when a storm (which we never see) forces them to hole up in the titular haunted mansion.  Bag of nerves ""Jeepers"" needs a rest anyway, so this is the ideal place for a cosy quiet night and a sing-song.  Needless to say, the house is occupied by spies who (in typical 'Scooby Doo' manner) use electronic trickery to scare away unwanted visitors.  When the spies' pet gorilla (don't ask) kidnaps the female singer ""Boots Malone"", our two heroes begin the hunt for her.  Things wrap up nicely with the trio ending up in Nashville and the last 20 minutes consists of music numbers from people I've never heard of accompanied by stock footage of an appreciative audience from 10 years before!
I mean, just read the audacity of that plot and you'll see what I mean.  Joi Lansing as 'Boots' is a pretty & shapely platinum blonde that cheers up the film no end (I didn't think she would fit into that iron maiden in which the villains imprison her as she's, ahem, a little big in front!) and actually offers a nice performance.  The comedy is pretty basic, but there are a couple of funny lines lines from nervous wreck ""Jeepers"" (not many, though!)
Best of all, this film is a reminder of better times that probably never existed and is ideal when you're feeling fed up and need something to watch with a friend, if only to mercilessly pull apart.  Even then, you'll have had a good time...",1100476800,15,1878,4.548961424332345

A little backstory... at a local game convention, I host what I call ""Bad Movie Night: The Game"".  The object of the game is to survive three bad movies, one after the other.  The ""winners"" are those who make it through all three.  The point of the game, though, is having fun riffing on the bad movies.  Thus, a bad movie, when viewed in a large group, can be a lot of fun.

This movie was not fun.  One could forgive the cheesy acting and sets, sure.  But the way tons of country music starts were shoe-horned into cameos is strained at best.  The numerous music interludes kill what pacing the movie might have had.  And these aren't songs that advance the plot, these are ""Hey, it's famous singer!  Sing your song!"" songs... did that make sense?  And then, the jamboree at the end where you basically sit through a concert of several songs... the story is over!  The credits could have rolled!  But, nope, 20 more minutes of a still camera on singers doing their things.
