8761342,4,B01FR36JXQ,"Presented by Adam Nicolson this DVD set follows him and a mate as they sail a yacht up the west coast of the British Isles. The idea is to show a part of the area not always given a lot of air time and to display it's rugged beauty and treacherous coastline. The entire series totals 240 minutes and there are plenty of overcast skies and stormy weather contained therein.

The series covers a broad range of points. There are elements of history and the pair visit places hermits used to live, secluded from the world around them on tiny islands. They visit a modern day Christian community/monastery as well as look at how the people lived in on some of these islands that would leave most modern westerners totally floundering to survive. The viewer is left in no doubt as to the hardiness of the kinds of people who could eke out a living in these places.

Nature lovers will also find their interest piqued as the series showcases a range of the animals that also survive in this wind blasted areas. And of course we get to meet some of the sorts of people who live in these places nowadays, from local historians to maritime rescue crews. Given the length of the show there is time to touch on all these topics and more.

For me it was a worthwhile purchase but there are some downsides. I didn't find the presenter deeply engaging but at least he was very honest in his feelings and very much came across as someone as interested in what he was showcasing rather than just some 'presenter for hire'. Production values were good and if you are interested in the western part of the British Isles then this is probably a very good buy.",1487289600,,1640,4.441860465116279
