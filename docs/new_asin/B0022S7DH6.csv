3841603,4,B0022S7DH6,"All of the other reviewers have a point - check out the prices at Warner first because you will never pay more than twenty dollars on that site per title. Chances are you will pay less because they always have some type of promotion going on. Do note that Warner Bros. has a minimum of sixty dollars in merchandise for free shipping, Deep Discount has none, and Amazon has a minimum of fifty dollars, just in case there is only one title you are interested in. Warner Bros. sells these archive products exclusively for three months and then other retailers can join in, but always for more than what Warner will ask if you buy directly from them.

As for the reviewer that had all the trouble playing discs, I have never had that problem and I own more than forty of these discs by now. I've had one disc that froze - Nora Prentiss, a few with audio problems - Dream Wife, The First Auto, and Carbine Williams, and jumps in the video in a couple from which I really can't determine the origin - that is, it could be the master not the DVD-R itself causing the problem. I'd say that about 90% of them play trouble free with only minor age-related defects rather than manufacturing ones.

As for this film, if you love the old Sunday horror matinees with 50's and 60's B titles such as ""Island of Terror"" AKA ""Night of the Silicates"", ""Hypnotic Eye"", and ""Wasp Woman"" you'll really like this one about a vengeful tree trunk stalking Pacific Islanders. It can only move at a snail's pace, so you can easily get away. Yet all of the victims stand there screaming until it gets them. Hilarious. The quality of the video and audio is good on this one. Just don't go to that well known internet movie database and believe the low rating if you're a 50's sci-fi and horror fan.",1254528000,18,1769,4.4067278287461775

I recently purchased five Warner Archive titles from [...]

to fast reverse search back to the start of the movie. Upon doing this
the films/discs then played through the films. Quality of the films
themselves I feel is very good. I attempted playback on five different

3841608,4,B0022S7DH6,"This film has to go in the ""So Bad, it's Good"" category. Yes, it is a totally ludicrous plot, with an amazingly ridiculous monster: a walking tree stump, with a face and arms (branches) and legs. It rambles very slowly. It is not clear how this tree stump manages to capture and kill its prey. But, it is a very funny film. I'm not sure it was trying to be funny, since it is possible young kids (ages younger than 11) may be scared of such a monster -- at least, in the 50's and early 60's. It is a prime example of monster films that I grew up with, and I don't recall thinking that they were funny at the time.

The plot moves quickly, and there is so much bad dialog and odd stuff going on, that I couldn't keep my eyes off of this film when I saw it on TCM recently. It will not win any awards, but it will bring you back to a more innocent time when going to  ""monster movies"" on Saturday afternoon at the movie theater were  a regular activity.

3841614,5,B0022S7DH6,"BOTTOM LINE: Perhaps the zenith of 1950's schlocky monster movies. FROM HELL IT CAME is a movie everybody ought to see at least once if they hope to make their life complete. And thankfully, Warner Archive's hi-def transfer looks & sounds pretty dang good. Trust me folks, this termite-infested tale of vengeful vegetation is one motion picture you wooden wanna miss! 5 silly STARS

THE STORY: Xenophobic politics favor heavily in this sappy story of a young island prince accused of consorting with the Evil White Man (gasp!) by his tribe's twitchy witch doctor, his power-hungry second-in-command, and the prince's own two-timing wife. Railroaded through the tribal judicial system, the innocent prince is summarily staked to the ground and then staked through the heart with a ceremonial dagger, but not before swearing revenge - from beyond the grave if necessary - on those who wronged him. Once the Prince's body has been stuffed into a crude, disturbingly outhouse-shaped coffin and vertically buried in the local graveyard, the weaselly witch doctor & his backstabbing buddies congratulate each other's cruel, crafty cleverness. But soon the barren cemetery is sprouting some decidedly UN-natural new flora... in the form of an unusual-looking, vaguely man-shaped tree stump. But wait folks, this is no ordinary tree stump shaped like a man, complete with a frowny face & bad bird's nest hairdo. Oh no, it's that legendary South Seas spirit of vengeance, the terrifying tree monster: Tabonga!

THOUGHTS: There's no way to say it other than that this film is just absolutely ridiculous. The script is so crappy it should have been written on toilet paper. The production design is atrocious. The blaring musical score is over-the-top obvious. The direction is stiffer than a 2x4. And the actors in this cinematic sliver are all as wooden as the titular tree terror, with the island 'natives' being especially cringe-worthy. (The men have apparently perfected a tropical palm tree Pomade, which they all slather on by the canoeful, while the women, despite being thousands of miles from the nearest cosmetics counter, sport more make-up than the members of KISS! And dig that crazy island witch doctor, the first native South Seas medicine man with a Bronx accent!) Still, there's just something about this film. I mean honestly, how can you NOT have a goofy smile plastered on your face watching a movie that prominently features a man-shaped tree aimlessly lumbering about s-l-o-w-l-y stalking pudgy guys in flowery skirts??? The creation of (criminally un-credited) legendary B-movie monster maker Paul Blaisdell, ""Tabonga"" is an memorable menace, indeed. Too bad he didn't branch out and star in other films. Tabonga is what Guardians of The Galaxy's beloved ""Groot"" would have probably looked like, had GoTG been made in the 1950's or 60's. In fact, I'm firmly convinced that the design for Groot, (who made his original appearance in November 1960's issue of Tales to Astonish, a mere three years after this film came out), was directly inspired by Tabonga. [Check the pics.] I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say that Tabonga is what makes this movie worth watching. Everything else about this unfortunately NOT one-of-a-kind flick just stinks to high heaven, and I'll leaf it at that. FROM HELL IT CAME would make the logical first film in an oldies 'Killer Tree' triple feature home movie marathon, along with the sadly unavailable NAVY VS. THE NIGHT MONSTERS and MAN-EATER OF HYDRA, both of which feature bark far worse than their bite.

THE BLU-RAY: The hi-def transfer for FROM HELL IT CAME comes to us from Warner Bros. Archives branch. The picture is mostly clean and stable, though some crush (video noise) is present throughout most of the film. The frame has been formatted to fill 16x9 TV's, but there doesn't appear to be too much of the picture that's lost so, given the eclectic nature of this flick, I don't feel it's too sacrilegious of W-B to have tampered with it to fit modern TV screens. Audio is strong & stable, the mono soundtrack clean & level. No bonus content except a so-so copy of the film's theatrical trailer, which erroneously credits the monster as ""Bawanga"" ? FROM HELL IT CAME is best summed up by Ed Naha, in his delightful 1975 movie monster movie reference book, Horrors From Screen to Scream, thusly: ""And to hell it can go.""",1493510400,19,4387,4.990437158469946
3841615,4,B0022S7DH6,"This review is for the blu-ray version of 'From Hell it Came' release on April 25, 2017 by Warner Archive Collection.

I had previously seen this movie a few years ago and bought this version for $16.99 pre-order.

If you are not familiar with this movie be aware that this is an old black and white movie and it is famous for being bad.
If you are young and a fan of high tech special effects movies this will certainly not be for you. That is of course unless you also have an appreciation for old science fiction movies and/or are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I am not a fan of that show and don't know all the movies they reviewed but if this isn't on the list it should be.

For this movie I am creating a new section called SPOKEN DIALOGUE.

BLU-RAY: The picture is excellent. If you want the best available picture of this movie then this is definitely it. Go ahead and upgrade.

EXTRA'S: The extra's are sparse. You get a trailer and subtitles. The trailer is just one more thing to laugh at. At the opening of the trailer, it gets Tabanga's name wrong, it says in large letter's ""BARANGA, The Tree Monster."" If this isn't bad enough, the back cover of the dvd case has it wrong too spelling it 'Tabonga.' Of course there is always the possiblility that the subtitles in the movie have it wrong and it really is 'Tabonga.' All I know is it is definitely not 'Baranga.' Perhaps it is supposed to be 'Topanga.' Until I read up on it, I wasn't aware that that is the name of the town in California where Paul Blaisdell (the creator of the monster) lived and died.
Not much in this department to get you to upgrade.

PLOT/SUMMARY: The movie opens with Kimo, an island native being put to death for supposedly being responsible for his father's death. His father was the chief. Kimo claims that his father was poisoned by Maranka, the new chief, and Tano, the witch doctor. Tano is jealous of the American doctors on the island and thinks that people are losing faith in his abilities. Kimo's wife, Korey is fooling around with Maranka and is also to blame. Kimo curses Korey, Maranka and Tano and says he will come back from the dead. Kimo has broken tribal tradition by going to the American's.
Kimo is staked to the ground and a knife is driven through his heart. The islanders break out into a tribal dance. I guess execution's are a time to celebrate on this island.
Speaking of the island. We next find out what the American are doing here. We have a professor and a doctor's on the island. They are there to monitor fallout from an island 1500 miles away. They say that the fallout from an atom bomb test on 'Nogassa Island' has reached this island. The U.S. has sent doctor's in case the natives get sick. The professor is there to monitor the fallout but he says that there is very little there. Nothing harmful. Supposedly a 'devil dust' has descended on the island. Bill and the Professor discuss the death of the chief. Bill says he couldn't help. He says the the chief was paralyzed from poison by the time he got to him. They are having some meaningless discussion about jungle drums when they hear a scream. It is coming from Mae Kilgore, an American woman working on the island that is in desperate need of a man. She was attacked by a native for daring to walk by their ceremony. Apparently this is taboo. They rescue her.
Meanwhile, Kimo is placed in a coffin that looks more like a booth and placed standing up in an open grave at the cemetery.
Terry, Bill's love interest shows up on the island to help out. She is a doctor/scientist that was working on another island and was sent to help out. Soon after Norgu shows up with his wife, Dori, seeking treatment for his wife's skin disease. Even though this is not allowed they come anyway. Dori has the plague along with radiation burns. Terry reveals that her experimental drug X-37(real scientific sounding) has had some success on another island.
Next we see Maranga, the chief, now spurning Korey. He says that he would never marry a traitor. His new love, Naomi shows up. She seems to have no qualms about openly talking about poison darts.
Bill and Terry take a walk and come across a cemetery. They see a stump coming out of one of the graves. Obviously they are clairvoyant because what else would warn them to the danger of a stump in a jungle? Norgu must share in that same ability because they make a drawing of the stump and Norgu walks in and stares in shock at it. He knows it must be Tabanga because he was told stories about it by his father. They all go to examine it and Tabanga has continued to grow. Terry says it has a pulse and heartbeat. They decide to dig up Tabanga and bring him to the lab. Tanu, who can't even come up with a proper medicine for sickness somehow has concocted a powerful medicine that will make Tabanga his slave to do his evil bidding. But we never get to see if it will work. Korey overhears the plot by Tanu and Maranga and goes to the Americans to warn them of plots against them. Back in the lab, Tabanga's pulse in weakening (Why don't they remove the knife?) Terry comes to the amazing conclusion that there must be some sort of blockage in it's aorta?!?! (Superb diagnosis...I wish I could do that with an unknown life form and no X-Ray or CatScan machine. No need to worry...Terry pulls out 'formula 447' (I know what your thinking) and tells everyone that this formula has achieved miraculous results in re-creating heart action (Dr. Frankenstein, I presume?) They give Tabanga the formula and decide to leave it alone for 8 hours with nobody watching (pure genious.) 8 hours later, guess what? The lab is in tatters and Tabanga is gone. Profess Clark convinces them that the natives wrecked the place. Korey, now jealous of Naomi goes to a pond where she is swimming and attempts to kill her. Naomi runs away and when she is cornered against a tree, Korey badly misses her with her knife and is caught by Tabanga. Tabanga drops her into the quicksand where Korey promptly goes out to deeper quicksand to make sure she dies while screaming ""Help Me!!!"" Tabanga next heads to the village to go after Maranga. Maranga manages to miss hitting Tabanga with his spear despite throwing at him from point blank range. He overthrows him by a few feet. Tanu and the natives set a trap for Tabanga. Tanu tricks Tabanga into falling into a pit. Unfortunately for the natives, they are not too bright. They build the pit with a ramp and when Tabanga falls in they throw torches at him and just decide to walk away an not wait around to see if it is actually dead. Well guess what? Tabanga didn't die and he comes out. Tabanga stumbles across some natives taking a stroll. They go and get the Americans. Meanwhile Tanu comes across Tabanga and does like a human in a zombie movie. He just stands there and lets Tabanga catch up to him. He then promptly stumbles and knocks himself out! No doubt he deserves to die for this sheer stupidity. Tabanga does not kill him. He just tosses him down a hill where Tanu's incredibly bad luck continues. He rolls himself right onto some sort of stake. The American gang goes out hunting Tabanga. Terry's feet start to hurt so instead of telling everyone to wait for her she just kind of hangs back until she gets captured by Tabanga. Our intrepid gang comes to her rescue....well sort of....While Tabanga walks away from them, they just stand there. Bill asks Eddie if he has enough light to see. So they just go ahead and start firing away. Don't worry about hitting Terry. Ya think maybe they could have gotten a little closer. Well Bill manages to hit the knife in Tabanga, thereby driving it further into his heart and killing him (How?...it's anybodies guess since it was killed originally by the knife going though Timo's heart. Tabanga falls into the water like....well....a dead log!....and he sinks!

PRODUCTION: The Millner brothers produced just one other movie, another famously bad effort called 'The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues. They spent most of their film careers in the sound department and as editors.

It is possible that some of the story lines that go nowhere in the movie (plague, Kilgore's role, Orchid's role, plot to kill the Americans, etc.) is due to the fact that the movie was cut at some point or some scenes were edited out. There exists photographs of scenes not in the movie. At the very least there must have been some rewrites.

The costume for Tabanga was created by Paul Blaisdell. He is notable in that he created other 50's monsters and sometimes wore the costumes and sometimes acted in those and other movies. He also created the monsters in 'The She Creature','Invasion of the Saucer Men', 'Not of This Earth' and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space' among others. Blaisdell got his start with Roger Corman on 'The Beast with a Million Eyes.'

'From Hell it Came' was released in 1957 along with 'The Disembodied' as a double feature.

OBSERVATIONS: I didn't know where to begin here so I created a new section on spoken dialogue. There are so many things wrong with the dialogue that after a while I began to look forward to the next spoken line. The dialogue is horrible and in places, literally, LOL funny (not quite ROFL funny but close.) I can't imagine anybody speaking these lines and maintaining a straight face. Of course, I have no idea how intelligent the actors were. Hollywood isn't known for using rocket scientist's as actors.

Quicksand is a Hollywood device that used to be popular in adventure movies. In reality quicksand is nothing like the way Hollywood portrays it. While it exists, it's very difficult to actually die in it. It is much thicker than water and people don't really sink in it. The only way to really die would be to somehow get stuck and die from exhaustion or dehydration.

Mrs. Kilgore doesn't seem to have a reason for being in the movie other than to provide some comic relief (as if this movie needed this... The tension was just overwhelming!)

It's never made clear what happened to the lab and radio room. They suggest the natives did it. The radio room has been destroyed also which would suggest he was right. But in the next scene we see Tabanga roaming around on his way to his first kill. Also clearly, the natives have no control over Tabanga.

The monster, Tabanga is almost universally panned as being ridiculous. When I saw it in pictures when I was younger I thought it was very scary looking. In fact I thought it was downright creepy, kind of like that of creepy clown. I guess those trees in the Wizard of Oz scared me as a kid. Of course once you watch it trying to move in the movie....you can see where all the derision comes from.

I know I'm being gross, but whatever that throbbing hole was in Tabanga's trunk...it sure did look like a throbbing anus. Perhaps Freud could tell me what that says about me.

Tina Carver as Dr. Terry Mason had quite possible the worst 'scream' of any girl I've ever heard in a movie. That's saying a lot. It should have been enough to stop Tabanga in his tracks. Her screaming was so bad that when she cried for help nobody knew that she was crying for help and instead they ask ""What was that?"".....Exactly......

I felt that the acting was very weak especially most of the characters that played the island natives. Most with speaking parts were obviously caucasian and were terrible actors. Suzanne Ridgeway who played Korey was awful but somehow managed to appear in 115 movies in her career. This movie was toward the end and I can see why. Tod Andrews as Dr. Bill Arnold, the lead is barely passable. Same goes for most of the rest. In each case they are either just passable or poor.

During the ceremonial dance after the execution of Timo a dance breaks out. It looks like they hired a couple of genuine dancers in grass skirts and the rest looked like actors who were extra's that had no idea what they were doing.

I don't know if Nogassa Island exists but there is a Navassa island owned by the U.S. in the Atlantic. There are several atolls owned in the Pacific by the U.S. in which Atom and Hydrogen bombs were tested.

While Tabanga is growing out of the ground, the professor notes that a lot of radiation is coming from it. I'm not sure what the point here is. Since Tabanga can live without radiation then what is the point? Norgu tells them of a previous tree monster that lived long before.

The musical score was amusing also. It seemed ridiculously over the top most of the time and it almost sounded like the soundtrack from a modern day tribute movie.

I think Tanu was a bit behind the times. According to him, it would take two moons and four days for his medicine to work on Tabanga and make him his killer slave. Fortunately for us, we didn't have to wait two months and four days! The Americans dug him up that day.

Ultimately I had to stop myself with the comments right here. There is just so much to pick from and this review has gotten way too long.

SPOKEN DIALOGUE:

Bill on his scientist wife not wanting to go home and be a housewife to him:
Bill: ""There are sometime's I could kick her beautiful teeth in.""
(Why don't you tell us how you really feel, Bill!)

Terry to Orchid as Orchid is staring at her taking a shower:
Terry: ""Why do they call you Orchid?""
Orchid: ""Because they say I'm wild, like our flowers.""
(Hmm....rrrreeeeaally... (Actually this was probably the best line of the movie))

Bill and Terry taking a walk in the jungle:
Bill:""I'm going to fill your head every morning with jungle flowers."" ""That's one of the advantages of living in the jungle."" ""You can give a girl a fortune in flowers and it doesn't cost a cent.""
Bill goes to kiss Terry while her back is against a tree. She turns her head and walks away. Bill looks dumbfounded.
(In all probability this wasn't meant to make Bill look like a cheapskate...it just comes across that way.)
Shortly thereafter Bill succeeds in kissing Terry while sitting on a log and then the following immortal exchange occurs:
Bill: ""You do love me, don't you?"" ""Admit it.""
Terry: ""I don't love you.""
Bill: ""Then why'd you kiss me back?""
Terry: ""My metabolism""
(This was the moment that I started loving this movie and looking forward to more stellar lines of dialogue).

Korey approaches the American's hut with Professor Clark standing outside:
Professor Clark: ""Nargu, isn't that Korey, the wife of your dead friend Kimo?""
(Talk about no couth!)

Bill and Terry seeing a stump in the ground at the cemetery:
Bill: We better get Clark out here to look at it. He's an expert on jungle trees and plants.
(Because you know....seeing a stump on the ground in a forest and jungle is highly unusual!..Better call in the experts on this one. Then they send a telegram to Washington asking what to do about the stump!)

Naomi comes running toward Maranka:
Naomi: ""I just saw the Tabanga""
Maranka: ""Well how do you know it was the Tabanga?""
Naomi: ""It looked like a tree.""
(Genius)

Terry's serum has worked and here are the results:
Professor: ""Tabanga has killed the chief.""
Terry: ""Oh no, I just wanted it to live.""
Bill: ""Don't blame yourself Terry. The radiation dormant in the monster must have set off a chain reaction.""
HUH?!?

RECOMMENDATIONS: This one is a hard one to rate. It's not a great value. I think a movie such as this should be a $9.99 release. But I do understand the higher price. If that's what it takes to get it released on blu-ray then it is what it is. As a serious movie it gets 1/2 star. Normally I don't found bad movies nearly as funny as those fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 find them. If anything I tend to find bad movies to be boring. This is not the case with this movie. In the second half of the movie I was looking forward to every spoken line and every movement of Tabanga. A combination of the utterly ridiculous lines combined with the seriousness in which the actors spoke them was just hilarious. In the 'so bad it's funny department' this gets 4 to 5 stars. For extra's it get's 1 1/2 stars. For the print I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars.
Overall I was going to give it 3 stars but I just had to add a star for making me laugh so much while I was watching it.

3841631,5,B0022S7DH6,"This is it, the goofy tree monster movie, only it's not really as goofy as it sounds. Co-billed with THE DISEMBODIED back in the day, this had to be one of the best double dips of horror fun ever. Both featured island paradises overrun by voodoo, sacrifices and/or walking tree monsters! Patrons probably changed their vacation plans to visiting Alaska that year.
The basic plot has Kimo, an island prince, being accused of the death of his father because he has sided with the white doctors' medicine which threatens the tribal witch doctor's good standings. Not wanting to be put out of a job the witch doctor sentences Kimo to death by driving a knife through his heart, but not before the island prince curses those involved, promising them revenge and death. They bury Kimo after the deed is done, and not surprisingly, he does indeed return, as Tabonga, the killer tree stump.
I know that this still sounds pretty goofy, but it's played with deadpan seriousness. The acting is rather good, the characters are interesting, the sets and photography above par and it moves at a pretty good clip. Some feel that the whole thing may have been more effective had they shown less of Tabonga lumbering around. He is awfully slow and the camera lingers on him perhaps a little too long, giving the audience ample time for laughs and chuckles. But the producers had their monster and they no doubt wanted to show it off and get their money's worth. It might have been more effective to have the Tabonga appear more allusive and given less onscreen time. But if that would've happened this lovable cult classic would not have the reputation it so rightly deserves. It's all about Tabonga.
I must have seen this several times on TV back in the mid 1960s and it was an immediate favorite of mine as it was with all of the neighborhood kids. Back then TV was loaded with great stuff for kids, various Monster Movie packages, horror and cartoon TV hosts, THE THREE STOOGES, THE BOWERY BOYS, TARZAN, BOMBA and JUNGLE JIM THEATERS, LAUREL & HARDY, THE LITTLE RASCALS, POPEYE and many other cartoon programs. No infomercials or endlessly boring reality show reruns.
Let me just add here that the Warner Archive DVD is simply outstanding with a super sharp picture for your total enjoyment. I almost didn't buy it because I already had a secondary market copy (full screen) which looked pretty good and a reviewer stated that this version cut off the top, bottom and sides of the image to produce a widescreen effect. But then another reviewer stated that this other reviewer was incorrect and that the Warner Archive version is indeed in the correct presentation aspect. So what the heck, I purchased the widescreen to see for myself and it's stunning, fills the entire screen and nothing at all looks cropped, distorted or missing. I fully recommend this Warner Archive for a memorable viewing experience of one of the greatest low budget monster movies of the 1950s and of one of the most likable and memorable creatures to emerge from the genre...from hell it came.",1424044800,6,3056,4.757062146892656

3841634,5,B0022S7DH6,"So bad, it's good.

From the golden era (1950's) of science fiction.  Comes  ""From Hell it Came.

Of course, at the top of the, good, bad, movies list is Plan 9 from Outer space"", and let's not forget ""The Creeping Terror"" either.

In this movie, the monster is a ...............  ( wait for it ) ................  Tree !!

Now, you might be saying to yourself how dangerous can a Tree be ?  Well, this tree is pretty good at sneaking up on people.  Yes it's true, he is big and bulky, quite tall, and moves at about 10% normal walking speed.  But when he goes after someone, he usually gets them.

Now for anyone that thinks a tree cannot be scary, just harken back to the Wizard of Oz and Dorothy's walk through the dark forest.

For those of you born after 1965, you may not appreciate the purpose of movies like this. It was for the Drive-In. Producers had to get something, anything, in the can to ship to Drive-Ins so the kids would have something to occasionally look at through their foggy windows.

A few reviewers have complained about the quality. I would say it's pretty good.  Not not Star Trek 12, but I would rate the quality an 8 or 9.

There have been a few attempts to bring back the style of 1950s science fiction. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and the soon-to-be released Man Conquers Space are examples.

3841639,4,B0022S7DH6,"Another classic from the 1950s, in which we learn that witch doctors are not to be trusted, wives can be pretty treacherous too, and Tina Carver can't scream worth beans.

I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this crazy plot.  A prince is executed and buried upright in a box of wood that sprouts into a crabby looking tree with unblinking eyeballs and the need to kill.  The things they thought radiation could or would do during the heyday of atomic testing is absolutely ludicrous.  Giant tarantulas I can accept but angry trees that stroll around looking to get even with anyone even remotely connected to their gratuitous demise (and subsequent reincarnation as a tree), is more than a little farfetched.  Although why anyone would want to return as shrubbery is beyond me.  At any rate, havoc reigns supreme even if logic never rears its head as this horrible tree of vengeance seeks retribution.  (Cue maniacal laughter.)

As for production value, there's not a whole lot of attention to detail here, the props look like they'd been used a dozen times in other movies like this.  The casting wasn't top of the line (although I did enjoy Linda Watkins performance as Mrs. Mae Kilgore).  The dialog could have used some sprucing.  And the tree could have looked and acted more menacing (less like a Muppet).

Be that as it may, how can you hate a movie starring a walking tree?  Yes, it's crap, but it's crap with a purpose........to make people laugh.  I enjoyed it.  But then, I had low expectations to begin with.",1405641600,10,1544,4.687732342007435

  There are a number of movie companies that do not understand the purpose of widescreen. The purpose of widescreen is to show MORE of the movie as it was originally presented in it's correct aspect ratio - as opposed to fullscreen which cuts off the sides of the picture to make it fit a fullscreen TV set. Unfortunately, I've come across too many distributers, such as Warner Brothers, that get a print of the film, format it to fullscreen for reasons unknown, then put black bars across the top and bottom to make it LOOK LIKE widescreen. WHY? Not only are the sides cut off the film for fullscreen, but also the top and bottom are cut off for false widescreen. WHY? Movies like this one are ruined, and are preserved in their ruined state probably forever on an outrageously overpriced DVD-R. Not a DVD, but a DVD-R!! WHY?

Meet Tabonga. Looking something like Tolkien's Treebeard with a killer hangover, he used to be a Polynesian prince, but Shakespeare's-Ariel-in-the-cloven-pine-like he is cursed to be reincarnated as a walking tree. Tabonga is a homicidal hollyhock who goes around slaughtering his fellow skirt-wearing native brethren, who, in a panic, visit some resident American scientists. To their credit, the scientists decide to discuss whether these guys are out of their tree or not, and (so as not to offend them) throw them outside of the well-secured quonset hut where the Americans live with a ""You guys wait outside"" slamming of the door. Unfortunately, the tree under which they take refuge from the broiling sun turns out to be Tabonga, and even though my great-grandma with a walker could outrun Tabonga he kills them to the accompaniment of some bloodcurdling shrieks. ""What was that?"" the Americans ask. Birnham Wood comes to High Dunsinane as this ridiculous movie reaches a climax of sorts, when the Americans decide to celebrate Christmas in July and use Tabonga as a Yule Log.

Do note that Warner Bros. has a minimum of sixty dollars in merchandise for free shipping, Deep Discount has none, and Amazon has a minimum of twenty-five dollars, just in case there is only one title you are interested in. Warner Bros. sells these archive products exclusively for three months and then other retailers can join in, but always for more than what Warner will ask if you buy directly from them.

I've read much about people having trouble playing discs, but I have never had that problem and I own more than forty of these discs by now. I've had one disc that froze - Nora Prentiss, a few with audio problems - Dream Wife, The First Auto, and Carbine Williams, and jumps in the video in a couple from which I really can't determine the origin - that is, it could be the master not the DVD-R itself causing the problem.
