2411209,5,B000BBOUE0,"My  DVD arrived in the mail yesterday, and my wife and I watched it all the way through.

First impressions:

This film was made with an *incredible* amount of love, affection, art and highly skilled craft. Before I'd seen it I assumed that there was going to be a lot of grungy ""home movies"" type documentary footage full of graininess, out-of-focus camerawork, cameras aiming into the sky, etc. - but absolutely not! Every scene was well shot, the color pallet always beautifully balanced, the scenes well lit, in perfect focus, with rock-steady cameras!

The first thing that hit me consciously was the absolutely wonderful Monty Pythonlike animations: first rate, and gorgeous color. In fact the color quality was wonderful throughout.

The ""Tolkien Effect"" of today reminds me of the 60s: then as now, people of all ages and backgrounds were caught up in Tolkien. They had the the Vietnam war; we have (unfortunately) the Iraq war. Both acted and act as stimuli for many people wanting to escape real life. Middle-earth was and is definitely the place to go!

Then as now, Tolkien would probably be whirling in his grave at all the things Ringers project onto his works (as he intimated in some of his letters), as well as being very appreciative of the fact that so many frustrated people want to escape the horrors of reality, and crave good in the world, crave that good will triumph, along with all the values that come in a society peopled by the basically goodhearted and cheerful.

When I was first getting into Tolkien 40 years ago, the term ""Ringers"" was of course nonexistent. As the film shows, many people rejoice in being a Ringer, but my experience on The Tolkien Forum tells me that there are others (who term themselves Purists) who would throw up their hands in horror and run the other way at being included (which they most definitely are!) as a part this boisterous funloving crowd - more's the pity for them!

The main thrust of Tolkien on the world of the 60s came initially through publication of the books - through Allen & Unwin, then through Ace (the pirated version), then Ballentine - at least in America, and of course Houghton Mifflin. And that wave went around the world several times. The difference between the Ringers of the 60s and the Ringers of today seems to be that the 60s Ringers first came to Tolkien directly via the books, and the current generation at one remove, through Peter Jackson's movies. Hence the creation of the (possibly unbridgeable) divide between the ""Filmies"" and the ""Purists.""

However it is evident to me now that the Filmies outnumber the Purists by far, the Purists being made up largely of the older fans, but  contains a surprising number of younger people. But there is another group which I call the Tweenies: those who like book *and* films, each for what they are, which I think makes the most sense. ""Ringers: Lord of the Fans"" celebrates the entire phenomenon.

A great deal of the fun of this movie is in the interviews with the Ringers themselves - a bunch of cheerful, funloving mischievous hobbits if ever there were! Some of the interviews are a bit salty, some are serious and moving, some are lighthearted discussions speculating on the sexual proclivities of some of the characters in PJ's films and only add to the hilarity. The costumes many of them wear are at times astonishing in the care that has gone into their making, and their creativity, imagination and beauty.

All our favorites from the movies are there: the main actors, and some of the producers; all their interviews are totally enjoyable, and it's so nice to see them once again! They all have good things to say, from the cheeky to the profound. Dominic Monaghan was the perfect narrator, and gave the film great continuity.

I was particularly struck by the sudden segue of being taken to Tolkien's gravesite - a serious poignant moment . It was only then that I realized by looking at the dates on the tombstone that Tolkien died the year after Edith - which upon reflection doesn't surprise me a bit.

Now that I've seen the film and become a member of the Ringers chatboard, I wish that they would have supplied its URL right on the DVD, which would have facilitated an internet gathering for discussion. Perhaps they'll do that in re-releases. I had anticipated a flood of responses on the board by now - perhaps it's too soon.

This film is an education for those of us who never realized the breadth and depth of Tolkien fandom or Tolkien's effect in so many other areas of life.

In the 60s, we had songwriters like Donald Swann, who set some of Tolkien's verse to music with his permission; now we have Howard Shore, whose music is absolutely indispensable to the movies, to say nothing of the rock musicians who took up the cause over all the years from then till now. I would call their music more of a reaction *to* Tolkien than a product of it.

I think today's Ringer is much less stuffy about Tolkien: so many of them (bringing along their friends) came to the Professor via the movies, and their first impressions of Middle-earth were therefore a blend of both Tolkien and of Peter Jackson's ""gratuitous jacksonisms"" which offended so many of the Purists, and delighted the rest. Then many of the new Ringers went to the books and got the real deal, and were therefore able to make up their own minds about the movies. I think that's so much better than wasting vast amounts of time and energy hating the movies for their deviations and extra-Tolkien additions.

I thought it was great to see that so many 60s parents now had children who either had been turned on to Middle-earth by their parents, or who had discovered Tolkien on their own, and had re-ignited their parents' interest in Tolkien once again, thus coming full circle!

I myself look forward now to reading Tolkien to my grandson and sitting with him watching the DVDs: giving him a lifetime injection of Tolkien, as I did my own three children!

It's been a few years now since the last PJ movie was released, and the DVD sales have dwindled - all very much expected. The discussions of them at The Tolkien Forum which were so hot and heavy have long died down, except for a few flameups now and then. Strangely enough, RLOTF has not yet made that much of an impression there; I hope it will. But the difference is that RLOTF was never able to find wide distribution in theaters. It appears that most of its impact will come through DVD purchases, and that's a different thing than line events at movie houses. And it's not about Tolkien so much as the effect that Tolkien has made on the world over the past 50 years - the ripple effect as it were.

And there will come a time when even that phenomenon will have for the most part run its course, and will quiet down. I predict another upsurge should Peter Jackson ever do ""The Hobbit"" (which I hope he does). Then the Tolkien madness will begin again for another cycle, and we will once again hear the cry: Frodo Lives!",1133308800,15,7008,4.630942788074134
2411210,2,B000BBOUE0,"My one thing about this documentary is that it is called ""Lord of the Fans"" but the majority of it doesn't have your average everyday fan.  I was hoping to see more of what I experienced and what I saw... but I didn't.  They only went to one Line Party, and, in fact, they didn't even really talk about Line Parties all that much.  Most of the interviewees were famous people with little tiny inserts from fans here and there.  Most of the documentary part was overly cheesy and the graphics were rather mediocre.  I was hoping for something more.  I didn't get it.

I actually had preordered this item, but someone I knew had a preview copy that I got to see and I cancelled my order after seeing it.  I was not overly impressed.  With all the hype I just thought it was going to be so much better.  I didn't want another documentary that's like many that I already own.  I was hoping for something fresh.",1132531200,8,906,4.3017751479289945
2411211,5,B000BBOUE0,"I have always had a thing about fanzines, you know the magazine written by fans for fans which sometimes grows into something more like Relix, for instance. To the uninitiated it is a way into another world so that you no longer feel like an outsider. I really liked the movie tie-dyed for that reason alone although in my case it was an exploration into a US phenomenom which had not crossed the Atlantic except when American Deadheads did!

Having been one of those people, although i will not say which, who read the Lord of the Rings in the 1960's/'70's, I could relate to much of this celebration. There is much within which is a joy to watch including the segments of actor interviews although to some extent I mourn the absence of others in the cast, and there is much amusement too.

i would have preferred not to have to see the re-enactment of 60's and 70's grooviness but it is a harmless distraction. The camerawork is sometimes cliched but at other times somewhat amateurishly fresh but despite those things there is an honesty and sincerity which shines throughout.

This is a labour of love which brings some insight into the mysterious world of the Ringers, their revitalisation through the movies, gives some marvellous views of some of the settings in New Zealand and some quirky though absolutely adorable antics of the Ringers, shall we say, on tour.

This is one of those movies you can watch in all honesty to yourself. It has no pretensions other than to let us into their world. A world of characters as individual as the ones they are interested in. Whether young or old there is a lot for you in this movie. I wish I knew where my old , well worn paperback omnibus (British) edition is now and whose possession it might be in.

On a personal note, it was the Fellowship of the Ring and the first Harry Potter movie which galvanised my youngest son into reading, something which he has continued to do voluntarily to this day. This movie has shown him a different side to the novel and made him aware of the broader enthusiasm in the world for the books so much so that after watching it he began a web search on Rings issues.

This is a great piece of fun for all the family. It made me laugh it made me cry with a twinkle in my eye and for that alone I heartily, without reservation commend it to the readers.",1132272000,39,2336,4.446261682242991
2411212,4,B000BBOUE0,"J.R.R. Tolkien once created a world where elves, dwarves, hobbits, and many other creatures wandered the lands of Middle Earth and other imaginary domains.  Within this world politics, economics, science, and many other strange inventions had their place, as the ecosystem had a fantastic environment of fauna and flora.  The first written piece, The Hobbit, brought the reading audience to his amazing creation.  It also introduced the ring, but at the time, it was still an unknown magical item.  Later, the ring's true dark and distant past emerged in the trilogy known as Lord of the Rings.  The Hobbit was a bestseller, but Tolkien's trilogy elevated the fantasy genre, as he gained an ever-growing cultish hoard of dedicated followers.  The throng of supporters obtained their name after the treacherous ring, as they call themselves - Ringers.

In the documentary Ringers: Lord of the Fans, director Carlene Cordova illustrates a comprehensive perspective of the Ringers from both within and outside.  It opens with brief description of the Ringers, as they are several generations of readers, listeners, and watchers.  These people are willing to spend a ceaseless amount of time on what they find endearing in an imaginative world acting out their wishes and desires through their creativity fed by Tolkien's literary masterpiece.  In more than a few occasions, it borders to fanatical obsession.  It also shows a glimpse of who they are in their private lives, as these Ringers come from all corners of the world.

A neatly organized perspective of the 150 hours of footage delivers 97-minutes of Tolkien's enthusiasm through a wide range of approaches.  Historical aspects of Tolkien's life and his well-read accomplishments interweave with the affect it had on readers.  It also explains how Frodo and his fellowship influenced the world in a social and political perspective, as musicians and writers such as the Beatles and Terry Pratchett developed their own artistic invention in the light of Tolkien.  In addition, several artists comment on how Lord of the Rings is one of those books that could only be a book.  Yet, there were some animated films, which visually brought the Hobbit and some of The Lord of the Rings books to the silver screen in the form of animation.  However, many of these remarks rest on notions with a pre-Peter Jackson mentality.  When Jackson undertook the gigantic project of shooting Tolkien's trilogy, he turned the page for the devoted fans of the ring to another chapter.

A heavy part of the documentary depicts the influence of the Lord of the Rings films by Peter Jackson.  In a similar fashion of the whole documentary, there are clips from interviews with the main cast and Jackson, who all enlighten the audience about Tolkien's influence on their lives.  However, the best comment is made by Jackson who humbly states, ""The masterpieces are not the movies... the masterpiece is the book.""

There are several intriguing facets within the documentary.  However, to hear how many readers of Tolkien exist and how the fantasy novel has brought these different people together in a positive manner is truly amazing.  Many of these are obsessive in their approach to the Lord of the Rings.  This is probably something that Tolkien tried to avoid, as he presented the notion of evil that emerges through the obsession for the ring.  Thus, to hear people selling their house in order to see the world premiere of the third installment of Lord of the Rings in New Zeeland could possibly suggest that they missed one of the major messages in the books, or previous films.  Nonetheless, Ringers: The Lord of the Fans offers an interesting view on small fringes of the society while also acknowledging that many Ringers do not necessarily have to be over-zealous.  Thus, if you are a Ringer, you might have a fellow Ringer within spitting distance.",1131753600,16,3892,5.029641185647426
2411213,5,B000BBOUE0,"""The Lord of the Rings"" was first published in the mid-1950s, to relatively little notice. Nobody knew -- even the author -- how important this one story would become.

In the years since, however, J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful trilogy has gained a fandom that might just be the most eclectic in all of pop culture. And in ""Ringers: Lord of the Fans,"" we get to see an affectionate love note to the fans who helped establish it as a modern classic, and turned the movies into megahits.

This documentary traces ""Lord of the Ring's"" influence over the years -- and boy, does it spread wide. In pop culture history we get: Led Zeppelin, the recent cover of ""Where There's a Whip There's A Way"" by World Without Sundays, who performed at a triumphant Oscar-geek party, and the aborted Beatles movie. Paul would have made a cute Frodo, but it was never to be.

And, of course, Tolkien's work spawned modern fantasy literature, here represented by Terry Pratchett and Terry Brooks, who speak of Tolkien's influence on literature. But media attention isn't all there is -- we get to see a town called Hobbiton, hear about elves and Woodstock, trivia, and a cute little reenactment with action figures.

And of course, there are the new movies. Dominic Monaghan (""Merry"") narrates this with a mix of gravity and humour, and there are snippets of actors like Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd and Ian McKellen being interviewed. And, of course, fans: Fans at parties, at cons, in costume, in rock bands, adoring actors, talking about the books, the movies... fans and more fans.

It tells you something that filmmakers Carlene Cordova and Cliff Broadway have done work for TheOneRing.net for the past few years. Namely: They are Ringers.

And so you can expect a certain amount of affectionate wackiness here. There is not a single dull moment in all of ""Ringers: Lord of the Fans,"" from the Terry-Gilliam-style cartoons to those miniskirted ""hobbits"" dancing around Leonard Nimoy. Its main flaw is that it is way too short -- I could have used a few more of those costumed fans making armour.

But will it be sneering and mean-spirited towards the fans? Thankfully, no.

""Ringers: Lord of the Fans"" is nice. Really nice. Nice to the fans. It's good-hearted, humorous and very geeky; Broadway and Cordova get down there with the fans and treat them as equals. We do get to hear about the more fannish activities (spending six months making a costume), but the fans range from serious and analytical to a bit wacky. They don't look foolish, just geeky and passionate. Which, of course, is precisely what they are.

Ringers, be at peace -- the affectionate ""Ringers: Lord of the Fans"" is not making fun of you. Instead, it's a quirky, offbeat valentine not only to the fans, but to ""Lord of the Rings"" itself.",1129507200,73,2815,4.787628865979381
2411214,5,B000BBOUE0,"""Ringers"" achieves something that alot of documentaries about the work of Tolkien have failed to do and that is educate and inform in a very entertaining manner. Bt demonstrating the impact Tolkien's works have had on all aspects of our culture in a wide variety of ways it truly keeps you interested and amused while giving you alot to contemplate. Anyone from the casual fan of the LOTR movies to the book obsessives will find something to enjoy and the filmakers love of their subject is obvious.

2411215,4,B000BBOUE0,"""Ringers: Lord of the Fans"" celebrates not only a fandom,  but a book that has become more a documentary of a lost moment in our own world history than a work of fiction.

Don't make the mistake of dismissing Ringers as either Trekkies OR *Trekkers*. With all respect to *that* fandom, there simply is no comparison:  Tolkien's world is a fully realized, delineated and intricate tapestry drawn in wondrous detail from the mind of a master wordsmith.

A homage to fans past and present, to books and movie alike,  ""Ringers"" invites you to experience the Fellowship of the 21st (or, as the professor would have said, 'the *Seventh* Age') Century.",1126915200,12,645,4.827272727272727
2411216,5,B000BBOUE0,"'Ringers' is a documentary by & for fans that examines the impact that

on a journey through the last 50 years, from the publication of the books,

up to the release of the films. My favorite moments are when the

filmmakers talk to ordinary, everyday fans about how Tolkien has

changed their lives, but it's also cool to hear from people like David

And it doesn't hurt to have Dominic Monaghan's lilting narration carry us through the decades of Lord of the Rings history.

2411231,4,B000BBOUE0,"To be quite honest, I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this documentary other than the fact that it took a more in depth look at fans of LOTR and Tolkien.  Overall, I felt the documentary was well done as they focused deeper on some fans than others to understand why they connect so deeply with Tolkien's work.  And, frankly, it was a breath of fresh air to get a broader view of fans overall -- not just those who were fans of P.J.'s movies.  In fact, the movies were just a small part of the whole as the film really followed the intense interest of Tolkien's overall body of work from the time it was first published until today and how, as the times changed, the interest in his writings ebbed and flowed.  The insight into Tolkien himself wasn't necessarily earth shattering but there were some interesting tidbits here and there that helped you understand his relationship to his own body of work and how he found the ""celebrity"" spotlight somewhat disconcerting.  Generally, it was worth the buy.  On a final note, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I can't honestly say I ""loved"" it but I'm glad I have it as part of my overall collection of media that delves in to Tolkien's world more.",1360108800,,1222,4.433035714285714

2411234,3,B000BBOUE0,"I love documentaries, especially about things I already love. This is an easy one for me, then: fans of Lord of the Rings, and all they have done since the books were first published. Sadly, it's not what I had hoped.

There's a lot of extraneous flash and dash here, having little or nothing to do with the main topic. There's a running scenario of hippies (over time their costumes change, but it's the same young actors) who are said to be LOR fans, but are more just a stereotype of ""cute young people"" in costumes. Not LOR costumes, mind you, but 21st century kids costumed as Hollywood hippies. Hey, gang, I was there: we weren't like that.

Much of the fandom for LOR parallels and overlaps with science fiction fandom generally, and with Star Trek and Star Wars fans. The basic idea of fandom generally is getting to know people who share a common love for something specific. Talk about it, make costumes, write fan fiction, Internet sites, go to conventions, be a part of something that excites and involves you the way sports does other people. They spend money on it, some make money on it, lots of people meet long-time friends and lovers, even spouses, as a result of fandom.

All of that is in the film, and interviews with the main actors for the movies, some scholarly types who have made literary studies of the mythic origins of Tolkein's ideas are all there, and they would deserve a full five stars if this vaneer of fake hippie imagery were not distracting the whole thing. If you were to edit out those ""hippie pad"" scenes and the silhouette dancers through multi-colored backgrounds, you'd have a far more powerful documentary of an interesting social phenomenon.",1336867200,,1687,4.673400673400673
2411235,5,B000BBOUE0,"I think some of the reviewers here are being ridiculously harsh in their critiquing of this documentary. Right from the start, it's made pretty obvious that Ringers isn't meant to be a ""serious business"" type of documentary, & that it is about the fans of Tolkien's works, not the works themselves. The documentary is made in a light-hearted way, & seems perfectly fine with maybe poking a little fun at itself (ie through the ""cheesy"" dorm room reenactments & the song on consumerism-- which, if you stop & actually think about it, is an interesting critique on how LotR was used as a cash cow for a while). It talks about pop culture because of the influence Tolkien's works have had on the culture (including the music so many people seem to like to complain about), & how it has even been driven by fans. And, since this is called ""Lord of the _Fans_,"" it only makes sense. Yes, it's about the books & movies, but in a roundabout way: the main focus here is the fans themselves, people who aren't afraid to seem ""silly"" or ""weird"" or ""crazy"" just because of their love for these books/movies. The documentary isn't trying to be the next great, big thing; it's presenting itself overall in a very light way.

I'm all for critiquing, but some of the lower-rated reviews of this just seem so overly negative that it's really ridiculous.",1297296000,,1337,4.617647058823529
2411236,3,B000BBOUE0,"As a long-time leader of a Tolkien fan group, Mootstock, I of course had to see a film that focused on us, the 'Ringers'. I had been hoping some film maker would eventually do a documentary focusing on Tolkien fans, as I have often thought the fans to be particularly intriguing and diverse. Granted, the film tries to do this, but it is only partly successful. Somewhat tactless and lacking in professionalism, it left me feeling a little insulted both as a viewer and as a Tolkien fan.

What it does provide is a narrow view of a certain kind of fan, focusing a little more on the weird ones. What it doesn't do is enough interviews with normal people of all ages and classes who happen to love these books for a variety of very interesting reasons. It doesn't explore how the books may have profoundly affected their lives. It doesn't ask what ELSE these LOTR fans may all have in common, which could have led to some interesting discoveries. Many topics that could have added value to this film were left out. It was more light and silly in its approach. Most of the fans they interviewed seemed to be attending a particular costume event. The Line Party interviews they did were just weird. I was the Line Party Leader at all three movie releases in Salem, Oregon, many of us in costume, some were out there for 8 hours, but none were camping out there for 8 days. If they had been there for 8 days, I would have probably given them a wide berth. ;-) We had people of various ages and various degrees of education and vocations in our line. If they had interviewed the people who were standing in OUR Line Party, they would have gotten an ear full of thoughful and varied responses from many points of view.

If they had wanted to see who ringers really are, the should have come to one of our Mootstock retreats, where Tolkien fans from all over the country gather to spend days with other Mooters doing, discussing, reading, exploring, playing and eating all things Middle Earth related. There they would have discovered a rich variety of Tolkein fans (fans of the books, may or may not be fans of the movies) with so much more to say than what was covered in this... Hroooom...Ringers film.

But to its credit the film does include some interesting moments, and the interviews with LOTR movie actors are very good, probably the best parts of the film, even though this was supposed to be a film about the fans, not the actors. Some of the history they included was interesting, though some of the ways they presented the content was just plain distasteful. For example, in an interview with one family, a little boy says something about his ""wiener"", an unnecessary part to have included in the final cut of the film. There were so many eye-rolling segments, that I actually found myself fast-forwarding over parts of it. But it did contain some worthy material. So though I would give it one thumb down for lack of professional quality, I give it one thumb up for the celebrity interviews and historic content. Bottom line: it does not reflect thoroughly or deeply on the diverse and varied groups of Tolkien fans we know as Ringers, but if you are a fan, you may still enjoy watching it.

If you want material on how the books became the movies, watch the movie extras.  This film wasn't about that.  This was a fun, VERY tongue in cheek look at the people who drive the popularity of The Lord of the Rings.

Instead we are forced to endure amateurish reenactments of hippies, then eighties kids, THEN grunge kids (all the same people in cheesy getups) reading Tolkien, and dancing (why??) in a bedroom--none of this adds anything other than another layer of superficiality because they have nothing to offer.

Repeat, nothing of substance is introduced here. This is another disappointing product, flippantly put together, trying to cash in quickly on the current LOTR craze.  You will be better served watching the extras on the LOTR box sets.",1240876800,2,706,5.113043478260869
2411254,1,B000BBOUE0,"""Ringers"" is disjointed and slow-moving. The overall quality is reminiscent  of an unimpressive ""special feature"" on a movie DVD.",1209945600,2,129,5.7894736842105265
2411255,2,B000BBOUE0,"My 3 biggest problems with this movie:

1.  Unlike ""Trekkies"", it shatters any sense of objective journalism that would actually make it interesting.  The filmmakers are obviously ""Ringers"" themselves and made a cheap film to heap praise on the choices they've made in their lives.

The guy doing the street interviews never pressed his subjects about questions normal people might want to know, such as:  ""How did you have 6 weeks free of any obligation to stand in line for Star Wars?""  ""Why are you dressed like a pirate / Klingon at a Lord of the Rings event?""  ""What in your personal life compells you to write sexual fantasy for fictional characters?""

Instead, he just smiles and nods along with their often absurd responses to his softball questions.  That's not to say they shouldn't have these hobbies, but there was no ""every man"" Han Solo character in this absurd movie.  Unlike ""Trekkies"", his questions never pressed these people to consider or reveal their life choices, which is what makes these people so compelling in the first place.  It didn't follow any individuals through any sort of a character arc or revelation, getting only snippets of potentially interesting characters who would disappear from the movie the minute they exited the little video confessional booth.  I wanted to know more!!!

2.  The production value was just all over the map.  The silly time-capsule dorm room transition scenes would have made Tolkien throw up, and were lingered on for far too long.  The Mexican-style song about the product tie-ins was just flat-out weird, annoying, and out of context.  The Monty Python-style animation reaked of low budget rather than quirky characterization.

3.  The filmmakers had nowhere near the access necessary to accomplish what they tried to from a historical perspective.  This is evidenced by the lack of access to anyone in the family (I'm assuming the ""Chris Tolkien"" over-the-shoulder hand shots weren't actually Chris' hands), reuse of the same cut-out photo of J.R.R., dated stock interview footage from LOTR movie publicity events, and the inability to show even one clip or original song from the Rankin and Bass movies.

What they revealed historically was something any casual fan would have picked up years ago, or gotten from a far better PBS historical documentary on Tolkien already made.  What they revealed about the fans was frustratingly limited and gushing with admiration only fellow insiders who ""get it"" could offer.

On top of all that, the title ""Ringers: Lord of the Fans"" doesn't even make grammatical sense, seeing as ""Lord"" is singular and ""Ringers"" are a collective group.

ALLLLLLLL that said, the subject matter was interesting enough to keep the attention of a more casual LOTR fan such as myself.",1195344000,3,2773,5.057268722466961
2411256,5,B000BBOUE0,"i enjoyed this movie very much. it has TONS of interesting LOTRs information. its also very well done. the movie visits fun LOTRs places, a town in the USA named Hobbiton, California, and LOTRs conventions. great cast interviews make this a must have for all ""ringers"".",1182902400,4,269,4.869565217391305

""Wait, chapter it back, I didn't hear that, shut up!"" were heard flowing from the basement consistently--and not a single fight!

Personally, I'd have like a bit more--maybe another 5 minutes, with a couple more interviews--on how Tolkien reacted to his unwashed hippies and their take on his work, but that's really about the only flaw in a wonderful fan to fan love letter.",1180396800,3,748,4.976
2411258,5,B000BBOUE0,"Okay, they've finally done it! On top of the documentaries about Elvis fans, Trek fans, and even Mozart fans, showcasing some of the kookier aspects of those fandoms, ""Ringers"" is an exploration of Tolkien fandom as a whole, with the good sides and silly sides, and manages to do so without the usual tongue-in-cheek ridicule of ""come see the freak show, folks!""  Having been part of all of these fandoms (minus Elvis), I have to admit that there ARE some screwballs, and that just goes with the territory.  I found the history of American Tolkien fandom interesting because I discovered Tolkien in the early 70's, myself, and have never cared for the association many people of my generation have with hippiedom, pot-smoking, rock music and other such counter-culture garbage that in reality has nothing whatsoever to with Tolkien - except in the minds of such people.  Likewise, in more recent times it has become the turf of New Agers who see magic and mysticism in Tolkien that was never there any more than pot-smoking hobbits or genial hippies in the Old Forest.  But perhaps this is because in the end Tolkien is such a terribly personal experience.  To people of the 60's, perhaps they truly did see Tolkien as a counter-cultuer tour de force.  Perhaps today's New Agers truly do see Wiccan mysticism in Hobbitry and Elfdom.  Environmentalists see Treebeard as the ultimate spokesman for protecting the forests (and perhaps they are right).  And likewise, I see it as a superb conveyer of the Christian message, whether it was intentionally so or not.

All that being said, ""Ringers"" shows the history of the fandom in all its splendor, and shows some of the truly clever costuming created by the fans.  The one thing that stands out is a love for Tolkien, however his great writings are perceived.  This is an excellent documentary, and one of the best, most comprehensive of its kind.

My husband, on the other hand, said it was poorly done and left the room before it was over.  He has never read the book, I have more than once!

2411262,3,B000BBOUE0,"Ringers - Lord of the Fans was disappointing.  It's main points can be summarized in ten minutes without having to sit through an hour and a half of twenty-somethings dressed in the clothing of the decades from the 1950's to the 1980's, dancing and pretending to read from The Lord of the Rings.  This is a documentary for young people who can't focus and who need a constant music soundtrack, a puppet show, and a mariachi band singing a song about all the LOTR consumer goods you can buy.

The actors of the Peter Jackson films appear for seconds at a time, saying nothing important.  Unfortunately, much of the interviewed are LOTR fans who are so obsessed with the series that one of them actually sold her home to go to New Zealand for the filming of the Two Towers.  There is a Tolkien confessional at a convention, but the people who come in seem like mostly potheads whose great contribution to this documentary is ""LOTR rocks!

2411265,2,B000BBOUE0,"So let me get this straight:

Mass graves containing hundreds of thousands of people have been unearthed in Iraq. Saddam Hussein also used chemical weapons on his own countrymen--entire villages of men, women and children taken out by poison gas. He also maintained rape rooms and used real torture--like cutting off hands, cutting out tongues, and throwing bound people off of buildings--against his own people. He invaded a peaceful neighbor to the south and, when defeated, violated the conditions of the cease fire, not to mention numerous U.N. resolutions. He shot at U.S. fighter planes repeatedly and evicted U.N. weapons inspectors. Then he apparently moved his WMD to Syria.

In Afghanistan, the Taliban harbored the terrorists who planned the bombing of the U.S. Cole, several American embassies, and the World Trade Center, as well as the worst attack on innocent civilians on U.S. soil in the nation's histroy where 3000 people died. The Taliban don't allow their women to even unveil in public much less vote or hold political power, and indeed the menfolk make a sport of beating their wives in public for the tiniest disobedience. Oh, yeah, and they used to execute people in soccer stadiums. They also destroyed the ancient Buddhist monuments in Bamiyan, because they were ""idols"" of another faith.

Yet somehow the U.S. is the bad guy? George Bush is Saruman? Luckily, Aragorn knew Evil when he saw it and wasn't afraid to act when confronted with it. We need a lot more Aragorns and a lot fewer Viggos.

This DVD was utterly ruined for me by the uninformed rantings of this soft-talking moron. Even if one ignores such misguided and damaging propaganda, this ""documentary"" is surprisingly lame--even for a die-hard fan of the books and movies like myself. Not nearly as good as ""Trekkies"", for example, which is as hilarious as it is frightening.

I honestly wish someone had warned me about Mortensen's ""Charlie Rose"" redux. I could've saved myself $20. Be warned if you find Viggo's ill-considered ramblings offensive, steer clear.

FWIW, I thought VM did a great job as Aragorn (even as a decidedly un-Tolkienesque reluctant Aragorn) in the movies. But now I have to make a conscious effort to block out the actor's unwanted ""activist"" messages whenever I watch the DVDs. Instead of seeing one of the most inspiring figures in all of fiction, I see another clueless celebrity who wouldn't know how to stand and fight if his freedom (and life) depended on it.

It is also a history of Tolkein and his book starting from 1954.  That part is ok but overblown and boring.  I was going into this thinking it would be more along the like of Trekkies or Star Wait.

It's an interesting concise coverage of the books, the films, and the fans. The film is wonderfully narrated by Dominic Monaghan.

One of the more interesting segments for me was the Lord of the Rings confessional. People were able to enter a booth and speak to a photo of Frodo behind which there was a camera and tell the 'world' why they loved the book/film. There was the usual effusive praise but also some touching moments. One boy comments on how Lord of the Rings turned him into a reader. Most talked about the hope that the world could come together irregardless of race, religion, and culture and work together for the betterment of all.

In the middle of the film is a sing-along about merchandising for  the books and films. There's a quick view of Hobbiton, USA and the Middle-Earth tours of New Zealand. Interviews with the actors and director of the recent film version, rock stars, other creative people who have been effected by the books. There a hilarious segment on fanfic where small figures of the main characters of the books read from their secret diaries. The special features are also more of the same and worth the time to view.

After seeing the abomination that resulted from Rankin/Bass that I experienced at her age, she finally understood my initial reluctance to see my beloved books in film when Peter Jackson did them. The interviews with the fans and the introduction to the internet sites helped me understand her better (and reminded me of an age when I slept on the sidewalk for the openings of the 2nd and 3rd movies in a trilogy).

I do wish they had been able to put in the quote from the Sunday Times about the English speaking world being divided into those who have read Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit and those who will read it.  Ringers provided an opportunity to discuss Monty Python's artwork, who are David Carradine and Geddy Lee, and why there are emus on Mom's copies of the Hobbit.

I consider myself a fan of the Lord of the Rings, both in movie and book forms.  I have read the trilogy several times and seen the theatrical and extended DVD versions many times.  This DVD must suffer in comparison.  It features some interesting but brief interviews with Jackson, Bowens, some Tolkien experts, Monaghan (the narrator), Boyd, Wood, Astin, Mortensen, Serkis, McKellin and other actors (Liv Tyler is shown briefly in profile but not heard).  There are also interviews with numerous fans.  The photography is fine and the transitions aren't abrupt.  Yet, the overall effect is just a bit above mediocre.  I was particularly disappointed in the 4 deleted scenes element.  These are merely 4 interviews that did not make the cut for this fan movie.

The parts about Tolkien fans are somewhat entertaining and informative, but the bulk of the time is padded with irrelevant historical notes, most of which are taken from the pop liberal media's wishful thinking about how culture was in the United States in the 1960's and 1970's.  For sure Tolkien was popular among the extreme fringes of local cultures; because at the time, Tolkien enjoyed a huge increase in popularity among *all* facets of our culture.  The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings paperbacks were in every college bookstore in every town in the entire country, and I would presume, in the entire world.  (This is an eyewitness account, not some silly spin-doctor's sensationalism.  Those were my college years.)  Everyone, of all ages, had at least heard of Tolkien and hobbits.  Most had copies of the books on their own personal bookshelves.

What was missing was information about Ringers, the Tolkien fans who actively embrace the story of the Lord of the Rings and increase its role in their lives beyond being a very entertaining story.  Who are they?  Where are they?  What do they do besides standing in line to watch movies?  How did they meet?  Are they active now?  What activities keep them together?

So Ringers: Lord of the Fans was an independent project started around the time of the high from the movie releases (when the fandom revived into the public sphere).

Starting off with a brief over look into the history of the creator and the journey of the books themselves, we venture into the growth of the popularity of a fantasy novel in a time when fantasy was reserved for classic mythology literature. Through the eras we progress, following the growth of the series from books, to animation, to films, and how the fans kept it alive for decades behind the scenes.

Silly animations done for a humorous effect and a way to save costs, help drive the narration in between fan and cast interviews (with cameos of some legendary figures who were fans when the works peaked in popularity first in the 60s and then in different eras).
