8181716,1,B000NVIXLY,A waste of money and time don't buy this. There's only one somewhat descent girl on girl scene.,1440547200,,95,4.333333333333333
8181717,1,B000NVIXLY,"It sucked big time, looking for xxx porn and this is what I got ? Seriously? Bring back all your hard core xxx porn dvd's. I could have watched that crap on playboy tv",1439856000,,167,3.9411764705882355
8181718,5,B000NVIXLY,"Secret Revealed was as close to a story as I seen Peach get, it's not the greatest but they tried and it was ok. The scenes were great the girls were hot and a somewhat story not a bad deal.",1410825600,2,190,3.775
8181719,3,B000NVIXLY,I'm still not sure what the secret was that was supposed to be revealed.  I expected some sort of story line.,1382486400,,109,4.190476190476191
8181720,3,B000NVIXLY,it was a different kind of movie then i thought it was but the ladies were pretty and showed more then i thought they would,1368662400,4,123,3.96
8181721,3,B000NVIXLY,"The good:

-Jaime Hammer.

-Possibly the best soundtrack of any Peach release.

The bad:

-It's especially good if you want to take a nap, because that's what I did, right in the middle of watching this.

It's the pacing. It's horrendous. This thing plods along like a snail, and that zoned-out soundtrack just makes it that much more obvious. Plus it was shot with what looks like one 75-watt incandescent light bulb overhead--moody and annoying, not typical for Peach. I almost got an eye-strain headache. On top of all of that, with the exception of Jaime Hammer these aren't A-listers, so they aren't really enough to keep your attention.

The final vignette is indeed pretty hot (lesbian scene) and much more explicit than what you'd expect from Peach, but that's just too little, too late.",1359936000,4,795,4.851851851851852
