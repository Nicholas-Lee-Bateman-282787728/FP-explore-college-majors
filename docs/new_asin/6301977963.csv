Neil Sedaka song is a real winner that really sets the tone & pace of the movie & for its castmates  to fall in love in this movie.  I love it & George Hamilton drawing a heart with his finger in the sand is a classic, one of a kind, never to be duplicated show of real honest to goodness emotion.

401467,4,6301977963,"It is Spring break and a group of four innocent young ladies are going head long into a wild and woolly Ft. Lauderdale where just about anything can happen and does.

Made on location at Ft. Lauderdale, many people can relate. This is called a comedy; however there are stressful moments and lots of good songs with words by Howard Greenfield and Music by Neil Sedaka
Performed by Connie Francis. I keep it as part of the George Hamilton collection.

Other George Hamilton films include:

""Zorro, the Gay Blade""

introduces Connie Francis in a supporting roll.  But that's ok.  I considered her the best alto singer of her generation. Perfect pitch. And cute as

401472,5,6301977963,"A trip down memory lane.  I first saw this movie in my sophomore year of high school, never having the expectation that I would ever be able to go to Ft. Lauderdale. However in 1967 in my senior year of college I did make it to Ft. Lauderdale, the elbow room and all. It was sun burn, too much beer, and the police shutting down the city because of drunken rioting. There were no high rises and the scenes in the movie made in 1960 were the same in 1967.  Fast forward to 2017 and I got back to Ft. Lauderdale. the beach is still across the road from the street, the elbow room is still there, but high rises are all over the place, so it was with great joy to see the opening scene of the plane flying over the 1960s landscape. The rest of the movie is pure nostalgia, with Connie Francis acting and singing the theme song.  If you're past 70 take a trip down memory lane.

I was extremely young when this came out but I just really like it. Dolores Hart, who dated Elvis Presley and became a nun, George Hamilton who I thought was so handsome, Jim Hutton, because of his son Timothy, and just typical things make me love this movie.

401528,4,6301977963,"Where the Boys Are definitely runs in the same vein as the Beach Party films, in that like those films, this one deals with young people enjoying the sand and surf over Spring Break. However unlike the Beach Party films, this one actually makes attempts to tackle issues facing the youth of the day - such as gender roles and sexual liberation - head on. While it doesn't do as thorough a job as it could have, it does offer some interesting, subdued commentary, and if nothing else, is very interesting as a time capsule from it's day. Plus, it has some great comedic lines and has a nice cast of characters.",1470614400,,609,4.446428571428571

401557,5,6301977963,"Ah Camelot. The year was 1960, John F. Kennedy had been elected president, the youth revolution was blooming, feminism was rising, films were glorious CinemaScope and ""Where the Boys Are,"" a beloved cult classic, would represent all of these distinct touchstones of the era. I originally watched this many years ago and was amazed how much I enjoyed it. It is truly epic in scope and feels much longer than its 99-minute running time.

Spring Break, the annual collegiate pilgrimage to every coast in the U.S. by inflamed youth, may have evolved somewhat through the increasingly decadent decades, but in ""Where the Boys Are"" viewers will see things have not changed much. Hordes of scantily clad men and women elbow for room on the beach, at the bar, in adult restaurants and for a spot to crash on a motel room floor.

What sets ""Where the Boys Are"" apart from other beach epics is its focus, in this case, a likable clique of four women (Delores Hart, Paula Prentiss, Yvette Mimieux, Connie Francis) leaving the campus snows of the Midwest and taking a road trip to Florida. Based on Glendon Swarthout's 1959 novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-The-Boys-Are/dp/B004E114L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where The Boys Are</a>), the film is told entirely from their viewpoint. And the conversations, taboo at the time, begin early in the film. Should women, akin to men, have the right to enjoy sex before marriage? Each character will have a chance to prove their point.

The potential of date rape is dramatically detailed in this film and, if anything, ""Where the Boys Are"" should be applauded for providing an honest warning to its hovering dangers. Each character in their own way must deal with the undercurrent of casual sex, prominent, oftentimes expected amidst the drinking and parties.

I loved the cast, to include George Hamilton, Jim Hutton and a hilarious Frank Gorshin as men who take a liking to our female heroes. Gorshin's character, a semi-beatnik in an improvisational jazz band, makes me laugh to this day. The on-location footage at what must have been an actual Spring Break in Ft. Lauderdale provides an immensely enjoyable time capsule.

""Where the Boys Are"" is funny, sad, romantic and most importantly, authentic. It is an enormously respectful document of youth, identifiable to this very day. The title song, sung by Francis and a huge hit, is somewhat dated. But otherwise, this film captures an essential stage of youth. When the film ends on a desolate beach, as Hamilton and Hart profess their love, you immediately want to watch it again, if only to return to those crowded, chaotic days of hot sun, afternoon beer and cold sandwiches. The week has just begun, life stretching out before you unlimited and never to end. One of the greatest films about youth ever made.",1461974400,2,2848,5.089935760171306

They also wouldn't understand the music or know why a superstar singer was in the film...they would wonder how she became a superstar.  Things are much different today.  I still love it and feel for the various young women, especially to pretend in college to know it all, but to really know nothing.

401742,5,6301977963,"The first and very best of the teen and young adult ""Beach"" films ever to come out of Hollywood and one of the best ""coming of age"" films to ever be produced.  This movie put the term  ""Spring Break"" on the map insofar as the annual migration from the bleakness of winter of northern climes to the fun, sun & surf of Florida.  Ft. Lauderdale suddenly became a teenage mecca for two weeks every year for students seeking more than a break from the weather. The cast is actually stellar for this type of film and includes:  Dolores Hart as Merritt Andrews, Paula Prentiss as Tuggle Carpenter, Yvette Mimieux as Melanie Tolman, Connie Francis as Angie,  George Hamilton as Ryder Smith,  Jim Hutton as TV Thompson
Rory Harrity as Franklin,  Frank Gorshin as Basil, Chill Wills as the Police Captain and the voluptuous  Barbara Nichols as Lola Fandango!  It simply doesn't get any better than that for this genre of film and everyone connected with this movie did a great, great job in their respective roles.  Connie Francis, of course, sings the title track which has become her signature song through the years, but more than a songbird, she actually had a few very funny scenes in the film, one of which steals from Dolores Hart!  People really love this movie and with good reason...it is totally believable and harkens back to the last time innocence was still a virtue but teenage sex was just over the next hill and definitely knocking at the door!  The scene where TV asks Tuggle if she's a ""Good Girl"" is absolutely priceless and the film makes no bones about and no excuses for the overwhelming truths of its day!

I actually chose to watch it because I had heard in a documentary that the star of this film, Dolores Hart,  later became a nun, and I was intrigued.  I was expecting some light, funny entertainment, and though that sort of fare was to be found in this movie, I discovered it was much more.  It explores gender roles in society; how ""far to go"" in dating situations, including the extreme of date rape; and making the right choices for onesself while transitioning into adulthood.  I would highly recommend that teenagers watch this film with their parents, because there is so much to talk about.  Sure, some of it is just silly, and of course the music, clothing, etc. seems dated -- it is a period piece, after all -- but if you've never seen it, I would suggest that you do.",1400457600,4,898,4.347305389221557

The film was based on a Michigan State professor's story and was for its time quite deeper than one might expect.  (Glendon Swarthout was the author.)  Some humor but underneath some substaance.

With many humorous lines she acts very well as Angie, the captain of the girl's hockey team. She is so petite and feminine it is unreal to think of her being a hockey player. She is feisty enough to be one though. Her line about 20,000 kids on the beach, and 80 percent are boys, always makes me laugh.  In the DVD release Connie is interviewed in tthe special feature called Where The Boys Were. It is so nice to see and hear her looking fantastic. Barbara Nichols is hilarious as always playing a flashy blonde. Character actor Percy Helton has a funny bit as the motel manager. Connie's next film is Follow The Boys.

401972,4,6301977963,"Today's college students will get a big laugh out of this film, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining and worth the time.

For those who don't know, Dolores Hart, the love-interest of George Hamilton here, gave up her fledgling acting career to become a nun.  She now heads a convent in the Northeastern part of the USA.  Recently, there was a fundraiser film-showing for her order -- as they were rapidly going broke -- where she appeared.

If nothing else, this film shows one of the reasons why ""women's lib movement"" was so necessary.  The men -- college ""boys,""  are allowed to sow their wild oats with impugnity, while the women/girls are supposed to remain chaste and stay in college until they hook husbands.  Dolores Hart's character almost gets kicked out of college for saying in one of her classes that premarital sex is okay.

Besides Yvette Mimieux, Paula Prentiss, Jim Hutton, Frank Gorshin, Connie Stevens, lots of modest bikinis and one-piece suits, Stevens sings, the ""girls"" wear girdles, the gang ends up in a cocktail lounge's glass-walled mermaid pool -- even Barbara Bain has a very small part.

Lots of fun and a reason to be glad things aren't ""quite"" as hypocritical today.

What a difference between the actions and even beach wear depicted in the movie, which was made several years before I graduated, versus my senior trip time, versus today's highschool senior trippers.  Believe it or not young people then (and still even in my time) had a sense of morality, decency and respect something almost totally non-existent in today's world.  The movie does suggest that a tryst sexual in nature did occur with almost tragic results.  The young stars were all in their youthful prime and had already either reached or achieved celebrity status as a result of being in this movie.

This is one of those fluffy teen movies of yesteryear that you can just watch and enjoy even though it is dated.  The soundtrack with several songs, including the title song, sung by Connie Francis is in itsself a gem.  Oldies rock!",1325808000,2,955,4.786585365853658

401977,4,6301977963,"Four New England co-eds swap the winter chill for the warm sands of Fort Lauderdale in the landmark 1960 spring break favourite, WHERE THE BOYS ARE. Petite brunette pop singer Connie Francis makes her film debut, with a surprising, literate screenplay crafted from the novel by Glendon Swarthout.

With her grades falling by the wayside and the winter seriously affecting her morale, Merritt Andrews (Dolores Hart) decides the perfect mid-term escape is a holiday in Fort Lauderdale with her three best gal-pals: Melanie (Yvette Mimieux), Tuggle (Paula Prentiss) and Angie (Connie Francis). The boys are beckoning, the water is warm and the ""dialectic jazz"" is hot! It's going to be a spring break to remember...

What sets this film apart from the sunny antics of the ""Gidget""'s and ""Beach Party""'s is the way it candidly deals with the subject of girls having sexual relationships outside of marriage. Dolores Hart's Merritt is torn over falling in love with handsome college stud Ryder (George Hamilton--long before he became a walking caricature) or remaining a ""good girl"". Yvette Mimieux's Melanie, on the other hand, falls into a dangerous mixture of rowdy college boys and alcohol. Comedy relief comes in Tuggle's hilarious pairing with TV (Jim Hutton), a lanky wisecracker who is ""queer for hats"".

Connie Francis sings ""Where the Boys Are"" and ""Turn on the Sunshine"". The supporting cast includes Frank Gorshin, Barbara Nichols and Chill Wills.

This reissue of WHERE THE BOYS ARE comes as part of Warner's ""manufacture-on-demand"" Warner Archive programme, and print-wise is essentially the same as the older pressed DVD edition (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Boys-Are/dp/B0000EYUDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Boys Are</a>).

402010,4,6301977963,"This film is not one of those silly and insipid movies about young college kids getting drunk, and getting involved in stupid slapstick situations.

It's about four girls who go on a spring break to Fort Lauderdale, expecting to find boys (which they do), but what happens is they end up becoming women. Delores Hart shines in the leading role as Meredith, a mid-western pharmacist's daughter who is already on her way to  becoming a woman. Paula Prentiss and Connie Francis provide the comedy with their boyfriend's antics. Yvette Mimieux is the young gullible and overly-romantic girl who gets seriously involved, and then abused by a bunch of seemingly good handsome boys (who are nothing but thugs).

Some parts of the movie are silly and stupid: the story involving Barbara Nichols, and Jim Hutton's infatuation with her. But that storyline isn't long enough to ruin the movie.

The ending is not that predictable, but you end up feeling that these girls have grown into womanhood.",1300233600,,986,4.957575757575758

Delores Hart is another Grace Kelly who ended up chosing the convent over the prince as an alternative to a movie star's life.  Jim Hutton is goofy but believable. And Yvette Mimieux! -- the perfect (and perfectly beautiful) ingenue.

Most of all, though, it's the nostalgia that makes the movie work:  Ft. Lauderdale when it was still possible, before it became way too gentrified and uptight about itself; the feedom to take off, hit the road with little money and manage to find a good time on the beach and in the bars; a more innocent time.

402062,5,6301977963,"Unlike it's remake ""Where The Boys Are '84"", which starred over-the-hill actors as college kids, ""Where The Boys Are"" cast young, college-aged stars. One interesting thing about this film is that it could have spawned a big, money-making blockbuster soundtrack album, but it didn't. Aside from the theme song, plus 2 others sung during the film, music is not a big part of this movie, story is. Another interesting thing about this movie is the outdoor location shots. Unlike Elvis' ""Girl Happy"", five years later, which was very obviously shot on a studio backlot. Most movies of this time & especially this genre were not shot on location, that's why this movie had a larger budget for it's time ($4 million). It's refreshing to see the stars on Las Olas Blvd. headed for the beach, & at the famous Elbo Room bar in 1960. Location shooting became common & taken for granted years later. The story revolves around four college girls on their way to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break. The movie is ahead of it's time because it shows young woman, on their own, furthering their education. It's also very dated because getting married seems to be the main thing on their minds. Connie Francis is fun to watch, but I feel she was miscast as someone who was supposed to be unattractive. No one pays attention to her & it's not very believable (she's not a big fan of this movie & I can understand why!) Dolores Hart had a Grace Kelly vibe going. She later left acting to become a cloistered nun. This was Paula Prentiss' film debut & she has an endearing, goofy persona/quality. Yvette Mimieux is cast as the dimbulb who sleeps around hoping each guy who beds her will fall in love with her (ugh!!). George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, & Frank Gorshin portray the ""boys."" Unfortunately, there isn't a really good looking dude among the main males (but there are some hot ""extras"" in the background scenes).

Has it really been 45 years since ""WTBA"" was first released?  Just hearing the opening notes of the gorgeous theme song brings back 1960 in all its glory, when girls went to college to find a husband, college men were still called ""boys,"" and there wasn't a Girl Gone Wild on the whole beach.  Compared to today's teen flicks, this is quite innocent, although some of the dialogue was considered racy at the time.  It's all about what good girls would and wouldn't do, with (pre-tan) George Hamilton dropping some pretty corny lines on the ethereal Dolores Hart.

If you have fond memories of one-piece bathing suits and shirt-waist dresses, join Connie in singing the theme song and relive those wonderful days. Highly recommended.",1133136000,57,1071,4.889502762430939
402097,3,6301977963,"Forty-five years have elapsed since its original release, but it is amazing how this 1960 film introduced a particular genre that continues to be produced today granted in a far more explicit manner - the spring-break, beach-party movie where attractive teens go through a sun-drenched mating ritual and somehow love triumphs over carnal knowledge. Back then, the concept didn't seem quite as jaded as it does now, and consequently there is an entertaining naivet about the timeworn story of four co-eds from a snowy Midwestern college who journey to Ft. Lauderdale for spring break to meet boys.

The plot is based on the then-accepted notion that girls in college are only marking time waiting for husbands to come along, but the journey to that goal depends on the girl. The four in question are Merritt, a smart blonde who is not living up to her academic potential as she questions the moral code around premarital sex; Melanie, so deeply insecure she mistakes sex for love with a less-than-honorable Ivy Leaguer; Tuggle, a tall brunette who zeroes in on an even taller, eccentric hitchhiker; and Angie, the supposedly plain one who gets used to being ignored by men.

Directed in a perfunctory fashion by Henry Levin, this is not the type of movie where you are terribly impressed with the performances, but I have to say the acting is certainly miles above subsequent beach-party movies. Elvis' former leading lady Dolores Hart plays Merritt credibly even as she is being seduced by a youthful George Hamilton wanly playing Ryder, a well-to-do Ivy Leaguer with a conveniently located yacht. As the most troubled of the girls, Yvette Mimieux (always loved her name) accurately captures the constantly forlorn, little-girl-lost state of Melanie, a teenaged Blanche du Bois in the making.

So pert and charming as Angie, Connie Francis actually seems miscast as a plain-Jane, especially when she sings ""Turn on the Sunshine"" with a stage polish completely out of character. The standout is Paula Prentiss who portrays Tuggle with her unique personality in full bloom and partnered the first of several times with Jim Hutton as the comically obnoxious TV. She is an underappreciated comedienne with a loopy charm and vibrantly twangy voice all her own - it's a shame her career never really took off the way it deserved to.

I think the film does make a valid, sometimes even perceptive attempt to address the confusion that Eisenhower-era girls had over sex and love. Girls were expected to function under a double-standard where the only way to attract boys was to have something to offer but at the price of their reputations. This point is hammered home when the tone shifts in the last portion to melodrama. At the same time, the film is filled with predictable comic scenes, including a contrived melee in an underwater tank with the zaftig and nasal Barbara Nichols as Esther Williams-wannabe Lola Fandango.

Prentiss offers her services and remembrances to the alternate audio commentary track on the DVD, which also comes with a looking-back featurette which includes interviews with Prentiss and Francis. Who knew this film would launch a hundred imitations? The minute you hear Francis sing the title tune, it is hard for a baby boomer not to get nostalgic. If you have an interest in understanding the mid-century moral code enforced upon the youth of America, especially girls, I can think of worse films to see.",1125705600,9,3428,4.996497373029772
402118,4,6301977963,"""Where the Boys Are"" is an interesting exploration of the mores of the college set circa 1960.  The film has the task of juggling it's intention of entertaining but also making a statement about the mating rituals of young adults and I think it succeeds on both fronts.  What I also found interesting was how the film approached the topic of date rape without trivializing it.  All seriousness aside, though, this is a fun and engaging film that holds up remarkably well.  This is made possible by an able young cast(Dolores Hart, Paula Prentiss, Yvette Mimieux, Connie Francis, George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, Frank Gorshin) who inject the film with vibrancy.  Prentiss and Hutton probably come off best with their comic rapport but Hart anchors the film well as it's moral center. Mimieux is moving as the most vulnerable of the group.  Francis comes off equally well as a songstress and comedienne.  This may sound trivial but the film should interest fans of the ""Batman"" TV series because it features two villains in it's cast, Gorshin(the Riddler) and Barbara Nichols(Maid Marilyn).",1107043200,7,1085,4.9944444444444445

So they cast her as sort of a Nancy Walker type comedienne, supposedly not attractive enough to be taken seriously but just perfect for comic relief.  But watching the film that makes no sense.  First, Francis steals every scene she's in.  Second, she is absolutely darling.  Third, as Paula Prentiss herself has said, it's hard to swallow Connie as someone who couldn't get a date, or a handsome date, since what guy could resist such a cute, right-there, sparkling, personable girl.  This odd casting aside, the film has stood the test of time, is still fresh, fun, beguiling, tuneful and without one wasted moment.  All the leading ladies are wonderful and went onto interesting careers (one as a nun).  The leading guys did all right too.

I was pleased with how well this  almost 45-year-old movie has held up (for the most part). It has some of the big-studio hallmarks (like the way women's wardrobes happen to coordinate nicely with the colors of the rooms they just happen to be in at the moment). But the lead actresses--Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, Paula Prentiss, and Connie Francis--are very appealing. This was Paula Prentiss's first picture (she provides a commentary track that is more gushy and nostalgic than informative), and her star quality is evident. Their male counterparts--George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, and Frank Gorshen--are less magnetic, but at least they don't wreck the movie. While you might want to pass on the commentary track, don't skip the featurette with Prentiss and Francis sharing their memories.

402124,2,6301977963,"In ""Where The Boys Are"", Hollywood Babylon strikes at the core of everlasting, unchanging values in a sleazy cornucopia of lust, lies, covetousness, sex and other sins.
Back in '60 when this flimsy film first played in a theatre near you, the Hollywood elite just as before, and just as now, corrupted the moral atmosphere by pushing abnormal, immoral themes as somehow ""normal"". Catch the original preview reel if you can, notice the blatantly trumped-up excitement, the false drama and so on. By putting Connie Francis in the lineup with that syrupy serenade title song, Hollywood knew they'd get extra bang for their buck from the pop music crowd as a result of ""free"" advertising every time the song was played on radios, jukeboxes and so on.
With one-dimensional characters and an equally thin story line, Where The Boys Are ostensibly displays four ""girls"" looking for ""boys"" while on Easter Break, vacationing in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. (Remember Easter, the day to commemorate the resurrection of Christ, cf. First Corinthians 15:1-4? In politically-correct, morally-incorrect times, the name was changed to ""Spring Break"" and other variations; ever wonder why ""powers and principalities"" have always tried to force God out of the picture since the Garden of Eden?)
I say ostensibly because the behind-the-scenes premise to the whole story seems to be an under-riding theme of abandoning the true standards of the day (and of eternity) and bringing out the worst in people in terms of their inner fears and desires apart from sound ethics. For the girls, the theme seems to be ""Get married at any cost!"" Lie, cheat, whatever. Play up to the guy, coo, flutter your eyelashes, fall all over him, beg for compliments. Look at every male within visual range and consider him a prospect for matrimony. Do whatever it takes to get a proposal within the first millisecond of meeting him, to paraphrase.
For the boys, the theme seems to be: ""Get drunk, lie, have sex without commitment"". It's interesting to note with 20/20 hindsight how these themes played themselves out on the larger screen of our U.S. culture throughout the 1960s, especially in view of the so-called sexual revolution, the abandonment of traditional values, the ever-increasing divorce rate, broken homes, abandoned latch-key children, forty-million abortions, the radical feminist movement of the early '70s, and on to today where we have almost complete chaos in our society, high crime, higher racism, and male/female role reversal. Now, women are out looking for ""hotties"" to have sex with, complete with AIDs and all the other STDs.
Ah, I digress. Back to the story. What we have here are four love stories, four little vignettes parlayed into a movie with Easter Break in Florida as a backdrop. In addition to physically being on vacation, the morals of the characters are evidently on vacation as well, a convenience brought about through the craft of script writing. What's the point of this film? Girl Number One is a Princess Grace of Monaco look alike, prim and proper, hailing from a ""metropolis of 11,000"" with her intelligence quotient for the movie (138), adamant about holding on to whatever chastity she has by playing along with a rich playboy, portrayed by George Hamilton. His character of course has a slight edge from a secular humanist viewpoint: he's got the yacht, the wealthy family background, and, oh, what the heck, let's throw in an I.Q. of 140 just to make the cherchez le femme interesting. Girl Number One decides to keep his sexual advances at bay but realizes this is a good catch because he's rich. How's that for shoddy values, ladies, marry the alcoholic womanizer for his money! This guy has Ted Kennedy written all over him, with lines like, ""I usually tell women that I love them, but I've never told them that I like them, except for you, you're the first one I've ever really liked."" Of course, since the focus is not on spiritual matters of truth and propriety but only on materialism, go for all the gusto you can and marry the millionaire, right!?! Girl Number One decides to pursue her boy later, after vacation ends and they return to the cold and snowy northland.
Girl Number Two is our dear Miss Francis. The script has her talking and acting like she's a ""dog"", some ugly mutt (who let the dogs out, woof, woof-woof-woof!). But folks, I have to tell you, Connie Francis has always been one of the most attractive females on the planet, so you just have to play along in your mind with this idea that she's ugly and therefore, no boys look at her, much less ask her out or propose to her. As luck would have it, she spies a goofy jazz bandleader, played by the much older Frank Gorshin (yes, that's right, The Riddler from the old Batman t.v. series). She engages in a pursuit of the musician who never praises her (like that night when she put on her green dress and green shoes) and somehow ingratiates herself to him when his coke-bottle thick glasses are broken and she is useful as his seeing-eye ""dog"", woof-woof. Somehow, she even sings a number with the band, I wonder how that happened.
Girl Number Three is Paula Prentiss, who went on to acting fame in other movies and of course in t.v. Her modus operandi is that she is a tall, geeky girl who would be even more hard-pressed to get a date/husband than Francis, except that Prentiss has ""landed"" the drunken Jim Hutton as her beau. So, while Prentiss counts herself lucky, Hutton consistently stays falling-down drunk. Gee, girls, every woman's dream, right. The movie builds to a climax when the main characters are all in a nightclub and Hutton goes lusting after an underwater dancer that the clubbers see through the glass sides of her tank. Of course, they all ""somehow"" end up in the tank, and then are taken to jail. Luckily, the high-pitched, squeaky-voiced Marilyn Monroe-based underwater dancer helps convince the local gendarmes that it was all a mistake, and the next thing you know she's out of her swimming suit and wearing a tight-fitting purple dress, singing and dancing on the beach while Hutton lusts on and Prentiss tries to hang on to him.
Girl Number Four is the tragedy. She evidently is fast and easy and drinks a lot of alcohol. She even told her parents some lie about where she is, just so she could go down to Florida for sleaze and sin in the sand. She hooks up with another drunk staying in a hotel room downstairs from where the four girls have their quarters. She eventually gets raped ""or something"" and wanders around in a suicidal haze, almost getting struck out in traffic. Notice how her dress is ripped in the close-shot scenes, but when she's wandering across the street, the dress is somehow not ripped.
The slap to traditional values ends as vacation ends and everyone has to pack up and go back where they came from, with or without marriage plans.
I rate this movie a two out of a possible five; it's interesting to view if you want to start pinpointing how Hollywood undermines true, unchanging values (see my review of ""Sabrina"" with Audrey Hepburn on DVD). After watching ""Where The Boys Are"" through the view of an eternal perspective, you can't help but wonder Where The Men and Women Are.",1071532800,11,7221,4.7914995990376905
402125,3,6301977963,"The best beach flick of the 60's. Since watching this movie all of the starring women - Paula Prentiss, Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux - have come on my underrated actors list, all before I realize the connection. I also became a fan of Connie Francis, something I thought would never happen. A year later I admitted to owning over 10 records of her to my older sister. She told me to keep that to myself. It more or less is Connie's movie but Paula almost steals it. (This was her debut too! She already had a presence.) Jim Hutton (Paula's boy in the movie) and her have great chemistry together. Apparently they went on to make other movies together which I shall see. The plot, what there is, four girls go to the beach where they all meet boys, but Yvette's ends in disaster. The movie also has the most sexist quote ever. It's on imdb but I won't quote it here because I don't want to give it away. Connie also did another movie with some of the cast here called Looking for Love. Someone please put it on video.",1071360000,5,1016,4.324607329842932
402126,5,6301977963,"It's funny how some movies can take hold of you for a good part of your life.  I was 12 when i saw this movie and i fell in love with it, the music, the cast and the location.  Many years later i ended up living in Fort Lauderdale and before they torn the street apart where much of the movie was filmed i'd walk along that same streatch of sand, go into the same bar and the same hotel which later became a gay hotel and unfortunately now torn down also.  But all this was such a romantic and simplier time. This is a great motion picture of a more trusting and honest time, a era that will never be seen again except thru the flickering of the motion picture projector hearing Connie Francis singing, seeing beautiful romantic Deloras Hart who is now a nun, and just a wonderful walk down memory lane.

They all meet some boys, but their experiences are all very different.  This movie is a prime example of showing how easily girls fall in love, and how often boys expect girls to be ""easy"".
This is classified as a comedy, but I think there's more drama in it than comedy--although there are some funny parts!
A great movie that shows the pros and cons of casual dating.",1003276800,5,460,4.476190476190476

I thought it would be some silly teenage romp, but found it to be much more. While is is great to see the fashion, slang and ideas of the era, ""Where the Boys Are"" shows us four different college girls who experence spring break very differently.
As each girl meets and tries to snag her dream-boy, we're taken along on the courtship and fun. The brooding George Hamilton and the kooky Bill Hutton keep the girls om their toes.
The sad story line of Yvette Mimeux as the pretty girl who doesn't know her worth and suffers because of it is a surprising and touching addition.
All in all, I give it a 4-star rating amd suggest it for slumber parties, sick days and rainy days when this glimpse into the sunny 60s Ft. Lauderdale. A lot of fun!",991008000,2,872,4.355828220858895

A group of teen-aged girls go on a road trip to Ft. Lauderdale to spend Spring Break.  On the way, they join some guys who are doing the same thing.  As each of them finds peace with his or her own personal dilemma, they emerge as adults ready to face adult obligations.  They will have problems, even big ones, but you can see that because they know more about themselves and each other, they will be able to face their futures with wisdom and courage.  Everyone, and I mean, everyone in the cast performs beautifully.  The film is funny, moving, insightful, and entertaining and I haven't changed my opinion since I first saw it when I was a lost teen. Maybe I'm getting more out of it than the author intended, but this film will make you care about the characters and feel good about the future, your own and everyone else's.",980812800,133,981,4.508474576271187
402154,5,6301977963,"Where The Boys Are is really the grandaddy of all Beach Flicks. Being made in 1960 it was totally different from the later Beach Movies the early 60's. For one thing it had a message about drinking, sex etc. which I find really incredible for the Genre, but again this movie made its own rules. I did not notice until a few years ago that this movie uses Jazz from the fifties instead of the Surf music from the later Gidget, Frankie and Annette  movies of the 60's which is what this makes it a totally different beast from the Surf flicks of a few years later that were  lightweight teen angst. This flick turned me on to the romance of Spring break as a teen but when you watch it later you pick up the romantic fable of post WW2 America. It may be a forerunner of 60's beach flicks but it is way above them. A final note on the fine- fine cast that went on to other movie and music roles except for the actress who fell for George Hamilton who I have read went out and became a Nun.",973382400,16,986,4.103626943005182
