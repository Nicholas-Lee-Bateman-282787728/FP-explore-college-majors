7938389,5,B00005ICGZ,"Troy Ashford makes his acting film debut as Justin Sharpe, a noble yet out of luck martial arts actor just looking for his big break. When he's fired from a major production for being too good (aka, risking possible injury to the other actors and crew by improvising what can only be rigorously choreographed fight scenes), he lands a gig on a low-budget indie show - so low budget they don't use cameras, except for the ones they used to actually film the actual movie with, since those scenes show up later as blackmail footage because - SPOILER ALERT! - the indie flick isn't a real movie! It's all an insidiously clever ruse to get Justin to be a patsy for a robbery! The rest is sweet revenge baby!

I have seen this several times and each time I'm left speechless with pants full of s#!t. This movie has it all - Ridiculous acting: The villians are laughably over the top and/or wooden or inexplicably Irish or Welsh or something. I think the female lead was kidnapped and drugged and forced to be in this movie. Troy Ashford's uneven performance can be forgiven since he's pulling multiple duties as writer, director, editor, film score, fight choreographer, kraft services, janitor, animal stunt double, taxi service, continuity and best key dolly script boy grip. Speaking of the script, it's pure golden crap if the synopsis above didn't clue you in. It does make a riveting cameo in the movie though, laying on the floor during a scene in Justin's apt with his room mate. Speaking of continuity, if you like costume changes as characters enter leave rooms and cars, you're gonna love Razor Sharpe!  Also play the Razor Sharpe drinking game! Every time there's a costume continuity error, take a shot. Chug for the duration of boom mics in the shot. Shoot yourself in the face each time another camera man is in the shot. For what it's worth, Troy Ashford does have a nice physique and some pretty decent martial arts skills. But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of this poop storm.

I can't recommend this movie enough! It's up there with Samurai Cop, Troll 2, The Room, Barbarians, Birdemic and Transformers 2. Troy Ashford is a true auteur - America's answer to Transylvania's Tommy Wiseau. I just wish there was a commentary by Ashford on the dvd. This is truly deserving of cult status. As of the writing of this, it's available from several sellers here on Amazon for a penny. I kid you not! I just bought this classic of modern cinema for a penny! The shipping was $4! Don't be dull and miss out - stay Sharpe and buy this now!",1427241600,,2551,4.61453744493392

7938391,5,B00005ICGZ,"Well this fine little production hooked me from the beginning.  The first fight scene set the stage for the entire movie.  Swinging punches, high flying kicks, and heads turning in pain, trouble is the only way I knew a punch landed was the horrible sound F\X.  I think the only fellow who could actually act was the evil villain guy who was just plain terrible.  I could select a cast randomly out of a phone book and get better actors than this film had.  This movie actually looks like a producer went to a shopping center where a cheap Kung-Fu shop and a Gold's Gym were side by side and started signing actors for their picture.  I think the producer selected the worst actors on purpose thinking it would make the Kung Fu look better by comparison.  Of course I must give applause to 'Troy Ashford' who gives an Oscar like performance, not the award but the fish.  The first gun fight was so realistic I had to make sure I was not watching news footage.  I mean these guys must be so strong, I never saw a gun recoil once,  I especially liked the use of smokeless fireless blanks, no one wants to see those fake looking muzzle blasts anymore like in the big budget films.  Apparently the production came into some money later in the film since they added them later in the film.  This movie is a tragedy and its only appealing quality is the fact that I could barley stop laughing throughout this film.  I highly recommend this film but not for action or drama, rather it's comedic appeal.",1003190400,,1495,4.4322344322344325
7938392,5,B00005ICGZ,"The movie is to long  in between the scenes with the Rik Cooper character.
The two cops are quite good, but let's face it...
Rik Cooper is ""da bomb!""",984528000,,149,4.137931034482759
7938393,1,B00005ICGZ,"This is the worst martial arts feature ever made! As a martial arts instructor, I applaude Mr. Ashford's martial arts technique, however his film making leaves much to be desired. This film was apparently filmed with home movie equipment and with a script in dire need of editing. Don't waste money or time with this ""production.""",971568000,2,330,4.910714285714286
