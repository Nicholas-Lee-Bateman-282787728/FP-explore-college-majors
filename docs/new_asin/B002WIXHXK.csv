8383148,3,B002WIXHXK,"VCI Entertainment has released a very strange hodge podge of rare Euro and US action movies from the late sixties/early seventies in a two disc DVD set. Disc One starts off with a French Bank heist movie Directed by Jean Delannoy titled 'ACTION MAN'- 1967 on the box but the French credits have it as 'LE SOLEIL DES VOYOUS'.  No matter how its titled, its pretty lame and dull with venerable French actor Jean Gabin just standing around looking crabby and a very out of place Robert Stack trying to get one more bank job done before the great retirement.  Not even the always welcome beauty of Margaret Lee can help this movie which clocks in at 101 minutes but seems like 301 minutes.  The print is a watchable 2.35 transfer but is atrociously dubbed in English having the actors mouthing words before the dubbing comes in.  The mono sound is raspy on the treble causing the words to muffle into one big muddy pool.  Second on the disc is one man show auteur Ferde Grofe Jr. writing, producing ,and directing many actors long in the tooth such as Richard Egan, Rick Jason, Jan Murray, and a totally wasted Martha Hyer in 'THE DAY OF THE WOLVES'- 1973 which was shot in Arizona.  It has to be seen to be believed and should only be watched after an excrutiating dentist appointment waiting for the novacaine to wear off. It should be fair to note that the transfer is 1.85 with good color obviously because no one wanted to watch it or remember it. Disc two fairs a bit better but not by much with an interesting mixture of Sci/Fi brainwashing and espionage 'THE BIG GAME'- 1972 lensed by excellent British Director Robert Day and a stellar cast consisting of Ray Milland, Stephen Boyd, Cameron Mitchell, the beautiful France Nuyen and cameos by Anthony Dawson and John Van Dreelen, its the best of the bunch.  The transfer is also nice and in 1.85.  The production looks like it was a British/Italian co-production with a nice music score by Francesco Di Massi.  Finally to round out the disc is the strange entry by Director Nicholas Gessner. 'THE PEKING BLONDE'- 1967 is an undistinguishable affair wasting the talents of Hollywood legend Edward G. Robinson who could have phoned in his performance and beautiful Mireille Darc in a trance most of the time and who is the blonde of the title. Unfortunately, not even her surprising nude scene can make the film memorable.  It was a surprise seeing Italian actress Georgia Moll in a nice part in a quaint departure from her sword and sandal films. The transfer is in 1.85 with nice color but still is extremely squashed making it seem like they should have presented it in full screen. The English dubbing fairs a little better this time around but still suffers the same fate as 'ACTION MAN', the lips are moving before the dubbed words come out making it look cheaper than it is. 2 trailers to some rare black and white film noirs 'BURY ME DEAD' and 'THE LIMPING MAN' are the only extras.  For the person who thought they had collected all the action films they thought they knew, this set is for completists only.",1346025600,4,3067,4.5989010989010985

ACTION MAN (aka: Le soleil des voyous) (1967) (101 min/Color) -- Jean Delannoy (Director) - Jean Gabin, Robert Stack & Margaret Lee
With actor Jean Gabin, the greatest french actor ever and Robert Stack (aka: Elliot Ness) well known around the world, this was not as good as it gets.

THE DAY OF THE WOLVES (1973) (92 min/Color) -- Ferde Grof Jr.-- (Director/Screenwriter) - Richard Egan, Martha Hyer, Rick Jason & Jan Murray
So, if you're a fan of caper and heist films, this is the one for you.

THE BIG GAME (aka: Control Factor) (1972) (95 min/Color) -- Robert Day (Director/Screenwriter) - Stephen Boyd, France Nuyen, Ray Milland, Cameron Mitchell, Brendon Boone & Michael Kirner
Cast members Michael Kirner and Cameron Mitchell have a great chemistry in this film, and that alone is enough reason to check it out!

PEKING BLONDE (aka: La blonde de Pkin) (1967) (82 min/Color) -- Nicolas Gessner (Director) - Mireille Darc, Giorgia Moll, Claudio Brook & Edward G. Robinson
A spoof on some of the Bond films and others, although the film was meant to be on the serious side.
