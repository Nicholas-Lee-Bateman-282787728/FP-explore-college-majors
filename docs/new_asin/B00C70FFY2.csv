5692249,1,B00C70FFY2,"I was disappointed by the print quality of the DVD collection. Poor value for any price. Watch ""The Golden Girls"" for a far better performance by Rue M.",1375142400,,152,4.464285714285714

5692253,5,B00C70FFY2,own the entire series.,1457136000,,22,4.75
5692254,5,B00C70FFY2,I fell in love with this series years ago and had not been able to find it until recently. I think all the discs are hilarous and one does not have to be Catholic to enjoy. If you want some good family laughs I highly recommend all these discs,1448928000,,243,3.979591836734694
5692255,5,B00C70FFY2,I love a good laugh and the play on words. You can bring the play home.,1448236800,,71,3.5
5692256,5,B00C70FFY2,Thanks for putting together this great set at a affordable price!  Once it came in my family and I watched all but the Nuncracker that's for Christmas day!,1440892800,,155,4.535714285714286

5692260,4,B00C70FFY2,"OMG!  I have loved ""Nunsence"" for years, ever since I saw it on PBS years ago.  3 out of 4 were good.  I like Vicky Lawrence but I prefer the usual cast.  That's why I dropped the ratting.  I love Rue McClelahan but my favorite Nun was Sister Abnesia.",1429228800,,251,4.040816326530612
5692261,5,B00C70FFY2,Love it.,1425513600,,8,3.5
5692262,3,B00C70FFY2,"Love the original show, not the sequels as much. Don't care for Rue McClanahan as the Rev. Mother....",1423526400,,101,4.666666666666667
5692263,5,B00C70FFY2,THIS IS THE BEST COLLECTION EVERY PRODUCED. I HAVE SEEN 3 OF THESE ON STAGE IN A LITTLE DINNER THEATRE SETTING IN MINNESOTA AND LAUGH JUST A HARD AS THE FIRST TIME I SAW THEM ON VIDEO (vhs). NOW I HAVE THE DVD'S TO ENJOY FOREVER. THANK YOY!,1421625600,,240,4.020833333333333
5692264,5,B00C70FFY2,"Have not watched the entire collection yet but did watch the first DVD, which was very entertaining.  When viewing the credits I noticed that it was filmed at the Frauenthal Theater in Muskegon, Michigan - which is about thirty minutes from where I live.  Dan Goggins (creator of Nunsense) is from West Michigan, and has done a great job capturing the essence of the nuns as we remember from way back. I did have the opportunity to see this same one on Broadway a few years ago, and absolutely loved it.  I highly recommend this for anyone who was raised Catholic as we can definitely relate.  Especially for those of us who attended Catholic schools when the nuns dressed in full habits.",1418688000,,688,4.614754098360656
5692265,5,B00C70FFY2,This is fantastic!!! So enjoyable!!!,1417478400,,36,6.4
5692266,5,B00C70FFY2,Awesome!!,1417305600,,9,9.0
5692267,3,B00C70FFY2,Quality DVD set and if were Catholic it would have been funnier and would have rated it higher,1414800000,,94,4.277777777777778
5692268,4,B00C70FFY2,"Good, clean fun. Rue McClanahan is a hoot. The 3rd in the series - ""Nunsense Jamboree"" - isn't all that great, but the humor & fun of the others makes this series worth the price.",1412294400,,179,4.142857142857143
5692269,1,B00C70FFY2,"Purchased this as a gift for a friend.  Personally, this was not my cup of tea at all.  Stupid plots, and cartoonish acting.  Dumb and dumber as the movies went from bad to worse.  It would not be anything I would watch on television either.  Again, it was a gift so it is not fair for me to review except that I had to sit through this drivel out of respect for my friend.  Only my opinion, if you like this kind of comedy,  then go for it.  Just leave me out of it.",1408060800,,467,3.893617021276596
5692270,5,B00C70FFY2,"I have not opened these videos yet as I had taped them years ago on VHS tapes which don't work on HD tv's now.  We have also seen a couple of them on stage several times and I can laugh now thinking about them.  I think that Rue McClanahan is absolutely hysterical as is Sister Mary Amnesia - actually everybody.  When I saw I could get the whole set in a format we could use, we jumped at it.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys musical comedies.",1406851200,,465,4.133333333333334
5692271,5,B00C70FFY2,"Nonsense was wonderful when we saw it off Broadway 25+ years ago.  These 4 shows were as good as the live performance was for us.  If you want to have a few wonderful, laugh filled, evenings buy this collection and enjoy it!",1403481600,,224,4.309523809523809
5692272,5,B00C70FFY2,"I bought Nunsense 1 and 2 several years ago on vhs and the color was beginning to fade, was happy to get the set of four discs. The music and humor on the 3rd disk was great and Vicki Lawrence appearance as mama made it my favorite.",1401235200,,232,3.9574468085106385
5692273,5,B00C70FFY2,"I love this collection. Some wonderfully talented singers in this collection.  I really don't think Rue is a great singer, but the other ""sisters"" are.  Fun for the whole family.",1395792000,,178,4.9
5692274,5,B00C70FFY2,Really enjoyed the story line and the cast.  Can watch several times and still laugh.  Great enjoyment on a cold evening.,1390608000,,121,4.714285714285714
5692275,5,B00C70FFY2,"I love this with the one liners it is Christmas every year tradition for us to watch, it's fun and entertaining and you laugh and then the next time you see something new you missed!",1387152000,,182,4.228571428571429
5692276,5,B00C70FFY2,"This has never been released on DVD here in Australia, so i found out how to modify my player to play all regions .
NUNSENSE was number 1 on my wish list. All of the cast are brilliant actors and great comediennes.  Sheer fun!",1383955200,,226,4.136363636363637
5692277,3,B00C70FFY2,"I really liked the original, but the sequels were not as good as I hoped. I watched and passed it on.",1383091200,,101,3.857142857142857
5692278,5,B00C70FFY2,Family Night HAS NEVER BEEN SO MUCH FUN!! Even the younger children 13 and up loved it. Bring on all the rest Nunsense. Every Catholic family should have a copy of Nunsense.,1378080000,,173,4.4375
5692279,5,B00C70FFY2,"These women are having so much fun it's hard not to smile throughout the entire thing!! Rue Mclanahan and Vicki Lawrence are hilarious, and the supporting characters all add to the joy of this collection. A great price for 8 hours of nuns behaving badly :-)",1375228800,,257,4.608695652173913

8577858,5,B00C70FFY2,I already Nunsense 1&2 and bought as a present and already knew how funny it is. I have watched Nunsense 3 and not to keen on that one.,1502496000,,135,3.857142857142857

8577860,4,B00C70FFY2,"Classic comedy, even Catholics will find this funny",1484611200,,51,5.5
8577861,5,B00C70FFY2,"For those who want some clean comedy and good musical productions as well as audience interaction, this collection is a must, especially the 3rd one (Nunsense:  The Jamboree).  Follow the escapades of Sister Amnesia with her fellow sisters and naturally Mother Superior from the Little Sisters of Hoboken (New Jersey) as they meet with everyday trials and tribulations that most of us at one time may have experienced but also learn life's little things that make us respect others but also ourselves.",1482796800,,501,5.097560975609756
8577862,4,B00C70FFY2,I like having the follow up for the original show (which couldn't have been more fun).,1475971200,,86,4.4375
8577863,5,B00C70FFY2,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!,1475452800,,23,11.0
