8652684,4,B00JP32N94,"Killervision has a GREAT twist at the end!  I love that twist so much that I'm willing to forgive the moments that drag.  It's about a young man played by Dean Kirkright who's involved in a car accident and suffers a brain injury.  6 months later he seems to recover and everything's fine... except for one thing.  Whenever he watches a movie the content suddenly changes to him seeing people he knows including friends and family being murdered viciously!  For example in the beginning he watches TV and sees a woman being stabbed to death in bed.  Dean's character tries to contact one of his mates when he sees his mate being attacked by rats on TV, but he thinks the guy's crazy and doesn't have time for such silliness.  In another segment he sees his mom's stepdad being murdered... and then it happens.

I guess the twist at the end can be explained like this- one big twist leads into an even bigger one.  SPOILERS!  Dean's character is actually the one doing the killings, and the reason he's going around killing is because his girlfriend was killed in that car accident and he's out for revenge.  Yes the same girl he's communicating with throughout the movie.  She's not actually there!  He's imagining her presence.  He even proposes to her which is odd.  Proposing to a ghost.  I should have suspected as much.

In one scene when the boy's arguing with his mother (and they argue a LOT since they don't get along- he blames his mother for the father sleeping with another woman) the boy's girlfriend is standing by the doorway and the mother walks right by.  It's a little odd the mother doesn't say anything to the girlfriend.  It's also odd after a fight with his stepdad, he hears the boy having a conversation in the bedroom which, from the stepdad's perspective, is a conversation with himself even though Dean is having a conversation with his girlfriend.  Wow, what a twist!  To add more to the mystery they don't even acknowledge the girlfriend, but then again maybe that's why his mom was so tolerant of his attitude.  She understood he lost his girlfriend.

Throughout the movie Dean's mates often give him a hard time about these images he sees on TV, and often want to beat him up when they come true and people actually die like he predicts.  For a while it appears some kind of grim reaper is the one doing the killings since we see something resembling as such on TV, but it's soon realized that yeah, it's Dean's character behind it all.

Maybe the message isn't quite clear enough at times.  After all the way we see the deaths happen on TV don't play out the way they really do.  Perhaps the movie writers shouldn't have shown the way Dean's character went around killing his mates at the end to help add more believability to the story.  And when the dark figure on TV says Dean's character is next to die, I guess this meant he was going to kill himself.  Oh and WOW!  I just realized something.  When he says he knows who the next death is going to be, the girlfriend automatically assumes it's him and not her.  *That* should have been the ultimate red flag that his girlfriend isn't alive anymore.  And reading into the story a bit more, perhaps the grim reaper-like dark figure on TV was actually Dean's character himself!

The writing does drag at times.  The conversations Dean's character has with his girlfriend are part of the moments that drag.  Lots of relationship talk with hugging and kissing.  But then again given what we know now about the ending I can forgive these scenes!  The times he argues with his mother and stepdad are good too.  The stepdad tolerates his behavior for a while, then mans up and takes control.  The stepdad says he always gets what he wants in the end.  The guy who comes in at the end to talk about his college aspirations feels somewhat of a waste of time more than anything.  College is the last thing on his mind.

I recommend this movie.",1500595200,,3918,4.537142857142857
8652685,4,B00JP32N94,"Wow, what a great little movie! First off let me say that it was obviously shot on shoestring budget, and the Australian accents are a little hard to understand sometimes, but let me tell you this movie is definitely worth seeing. It really keeps you hooked from to start to finish.

Jared and his girlfriend Shelby leave a party and get into a car driven by Shelbys drunken brother, Preston. The writings on the wall and the obvious does occur  the car crashes. Jared is left with a devastating head injury, and his promising future is ruined.

Six months later, Jared has recovered from his injury but hes not the same person he was before the accident. While watching B grade movies on TV, he starts seeing visions of people being murdered by a masked man. Not just any people, people he knows, people who were involved in his accident.

Even though I guessed the answer to the mystery, I was still totally engaged by the journey. I was sympathetic to the characters and fully engaged by the drama. Yes, this film is low budget, and yes, there are a few problems because of that. But Im telling you, don't be put off by that. Things actually happen, and there are lots of great plot points. The plot has movement, flow, cohesion, and a clear beginning, middle and wholly satisfying end. The characters are emotionally engaging. There is drama and there is subtext. All in all, this is a great little movie with a solid plot that will keep you engaged right until the end credits roll.",1445126400,,1487,4.558052434456929
8652686,4,B00JP32N94,"Killervison is a strong, creative story that pulls you into the casual, yet effective, drama. The characters are well developed and relatable. The story arch flows smoothly with very little flaw. Trott creates a dark, mature situation that is both emotional and chilling. I found the dialog to be strong, often the intensity of the scenes are histrionic and captivating. The actors do a good job of bringing believable characters to the screen with a natural tactility.

The special effects used in Killervision stay with a limited practical concept. A lot of the brutality is off camera, giving quick flashes of the killing sequence. Most of the deaths are tastefully done without gore, some kill sequences give the blood and gore, but for the most part Killervision takes a stripped down, minimalist approach to the horror elements. The cool aspects of effect comes from the visual gimmicks used. The cinematography and vision is surreal, with a blend of experimental art-house style. There is a haunting, destitution that lingers in the atmospheric effect in Killervision that is brought to life with chilling instrumental effects. Classic sounds, and music carry an ominous tone that is hypnotic.

Overall Killervision manages to create a plausible, twisted story that embraces the classic elements of horror while maintaining an original, modern concept. The film is entertaining and heartfelt, thanks to committed actors who make these characters believable. Trotts story is a strong, thought out nightmare that is disturbing and entertaining. There is some moments that fall a little flat and don't create the thrilling effect that the scene shoots for, but the momentum that builds steadily through Killervision is constant. I found this film entertaining, smart, and mature. The story is original, creative and comes with a twist that you only recognize as a possibility during the last act.",1431129600,,1900,5.267326732673268
8652687,5,B00JP32N94,"I would like to start by saying  this isn't a paramount picture release. That being said Brain Damage Films has come a LONG WAY in making horror films. After sitting down and watching this movie straight few (which took a couple days due to lack of time) I change my four stars to five! This is a great horror flick and has a great cast of actors. If it doesn't win over the total horror community IT WILL DEFINITELY GO DOWN AS A CULT CLASSIC IN MY OPINION!  I like it when a movie has character,an interesting plot and good actors and all three are present in this film. This movie has all elements that need be present in a good horror movie. I own over 2000 dvds and this movie has made a great  adition to my collection. WAY TO GO BRAIN DAMAGE FILMS !!!!!!!!!",1412035200,,763,4.212328767123288
