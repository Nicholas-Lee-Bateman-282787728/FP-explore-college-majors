2002775,4,B0001I1J7O,"Masala Bangra 2 is a lot fun and easy for beginners. There is not a lot of detailed instruction on this, but I think that would take away from the work out. If you need to slow down the steps you can try Bhangra Work out Vol. 1 by Sat Pavan Kaur Khalsa.",1243209600,,253,3.792452830188679
2002776,2,B0001I1J7O,"I've had this DVD about a year and a half now, but have never been able to get into it because of the issue I have reconciling the instructions and music with my steps. I never had a problem with coordination, but this workout gives me such a complex that I usually end up marching to the beat. Would not be my first choice.",1211846400,,324,4.078125
2002777,4,B0001I1J7O,"Ever since the first time I did the Masala Bhangra workout I was hooked.  It's so different than anything else, and it's so much fun.  This video is good for beginners.  My mother-in-law has a bad back and knees and she could do all the moves without pain.  Jain is very energetic, but she doesn't give you much time to learn the moves.  Don't give up - you'll catch on after doing the video a couple of times.  The reason I only gave this video 4 stars is because her timing is off for most of the video.  The moves don't go with the beat, and it made me a little crazy when I was first starting to learn it.  I never dred doing this video.",1205971200,2,641,4.031746031746032
2002778,5,B0001I1J7O,I enjoyed this workout.  You are moving continually and the moves aren't too hard.  Can't wait to try some of Sarina Jain's other workouts.,1193788800,,139,4.75
2002779,3,B0001I1J7O,"I agree with the other reviews of this product that a) it is a great cardio workout (it is very reasonable in length) and b) that the music doesn't necessarily match the moves, and it is very frustrating when she says something like ""feel the music!""  I am a decent dancer in general and know how to do bhangra actually, but this workout dvd/video makes me feel inept!!!",1185321600,7,370,4.4411764705882355
2002780,3,B0001I1J7O,"As a workout, I found that this video provided plenty of cardio.  However, if you're actually looking to learn bhangra, this may be a poor introduction.  The instructor doesn't really teach or break down any of the moves so it's pretty hard to learn for those of us who are not familiar with bhangra or aren't naturally endowed with dancing talents.  Oh, and one thing that really annoyed me was that the moves didn't move with the music (if it could be called that, since it was the same background track going the entire video).",1176768000,3,530,4.557894736842106
2002781,5,B0001I1J7O,"I am a dance instructor and recently had a very basic introduction to Bhangra. It is a dynamic, high energy dance and I wanted to learn more moves and how to put them together. This video, while billed as a workout DVD, also gives you some great bhangra moves so that after a few practices, you're really dancing the Bhangra! Good quality filming and high energy instructor. I really enjoyed it.",1169078400,8,395,4.577464788732394
2002782,4,B0001I1J7O,"I borrowed this DVD from a neighbor.  I enjoyed it so much I ordered my own copy.  I was not familiar with bhangra but found the steps quite similiar to hip hop or african dance moves.  It was pretty easy to follow.  Although its a bit repetitive, this DVD is a nice change of pace from the traditional cardio workouts. It gets the blood pumping and you'll definitely work up a sweat.  I was drenched by the end of the workout.  The only complaint I have is that the dance steps aren't truly in sync with the music.  Its a little annoying for those of us with rhythm.",1156377600,16,567,4.194444444444445
8012823,5,B0001I1J7O,Give us a great variety for folks that have plateaued out and need some other type of workout to keep us interested!  Very authentic and very energetic!,1364515200,,152,4.62962962962963
8012824,2,B0001I1J7O,"I expected to have a great ""hip hop"" style workout from this DVD, but I don't get that.  Plus the quality of the DVD was so bad that in the middle of the session, it went back to ""warm up"" session again.  And the picture will not stop shaking during the whole 45 minutes.  Very disappointed!",1356048000,,291,4.160714285714286
8012825,2,B0001I1J7O,"I did not like this one nearly as much as I liked Volume 1. Some of the moves in this video were already covered in the first one and in her All-Star Workouts routine (which I wish was also available on DVD). Additionally, the production quality was not as good as it should have been. I will be getting Volume 3 eventually, however, because I am interested in learning as much Bhangra as I can.",1336348800,2,395,4.28
8012826,3,B0001I1J7O,"When I get bored with my routine, I like to do a little bhangra.  This dvd is not bad at all, but not great like I thought it would be.  It did seem more repetitive than most dance/exercise routines.  It will make you sweat and she is exhuberant.  I worked up a good sweat.  I just was hoping there was a ""little more to it.""  Amazon delivery and any interaction was terrific.  I always trust orders from Amazon.",1324857600,,412,4.205128205128205
8012827,4,B0001I1J7O,"I bought #2, Hip Hop style based on earlier Amazon reviews.  Its great! I didn't find it too fast at all, I have purchased two Hip Hop DVDs before this and Jain's instructions were so much easier to learn and follow than classical Hip Hop. She almost always return to her ""Basic"" move, which allows you to catch up if you fall behind.

The moves are not complicated (although the head wiggle isn't as easy as it looks!) so by the 3rd time through most people should be able to do basic Bhangra smoothly. And her sequences make for easy transitions.

Lastly, I have bad knees - had a meniscus repair a few years ago from over aggressive skiing. So I had to give away a DVD by a ""celebrity"" hip hop dance person because I couldn't do any of the low moves or squats. This DVD does not make my knees hurt. So its a keeper, especially if you aren't as limber as you used to be.",1311206400,,872,4.178571428571429
8012828,5,B0001I1J7O,I'm really enjoying this exercise DVD.  It does give you a workout but allows you to pace yourself.  It's fun!,1303603200,,110,4.45
8012829,4,B0001I1J7O,"really fun, dance workout if you like this type of music.  the instructor shows you the basic moves then puts it all together for routines that move quickly but are still good for a beginner.  somewhat mid-DVD, she walks through the steps so that is one thing to look for.  it is a an ok workout but a lot of fun and gets you moving and who knows maybe you will learn a dance step or two!  enjoy!",1294790400,,396,4.038461538461538
8012830,5,B0001I1J7O,"This video is so awesome. I HATE work out videos, they are always boring and stupid...
But this one is great! I worked up a good sweat and didn't even realise it! I have always been fond of the indian style of dancing and the instructor makes it easy to follow along. This is the best work out video ever,I completely suggest buying it! (even though it isn't the most economically priced) This video would be really fun to do with a friend too!",1270166400,,444,4.2976190476190474
8012831,5,B0001I1J7O,"Overall I like this DVD as a workout.  I would only recommend it for people with some dance experience because she does each move VERY FAST without slowly demonstrating it first.  For those who can keep up with her, it makes for a great energetic/tiring workout.  There are a variety of fun moves...except in between each move she often does a boring ""Basic Step""(but this step does serve the purpose of having the ""students"" catch up with her if we're out of sync and also serves the purpose of keeping body moving and heart rate up while waiting to do the next step).
This Vol 2 is good in that the camera angles show her feet/legs (unlike the Vol 3 DVD which focuses the camera on her face/torso).",1262995200,,700,4.453125
8012832,4,B0001I1J7O,"I tried the first Masala Bhangra Workout w/Sarina Jain & loved it, so I also tried this one after seeing a youtube clip.
Sarina Jain is a great teacher & her love of dance really motivates you. She also has great fluidity & having her teach w/a mic as she dances is a great change of place. Compared to the first one, the students here aren't professional or aspiring professionals, but they are pretty good.
The moves are introduced by text display, and Sarina DOES breakdown the moves, first starting with the lower body, then upper. She will even break down so you learn it in 4 layers. I had no trouble following & I have never taken a dance class nor am I a natural dancer. The moves are very simple & I did not think it needed that much breakdown.
The only con other then the backup dancers not having as much energy as the professionals in the first one is one I agree with that other reviewers mentioned. The beat, that really isn't as much a motivator. But Sarina's love & excitement of dance & to share it makes up for it in my opinion.
