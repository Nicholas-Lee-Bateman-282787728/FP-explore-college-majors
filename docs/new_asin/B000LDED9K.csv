8161599,5,B000LDED9K,"Who doesn't remember ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" I remember growing up, looking forward to this ever Saturday night on Snick. It was a ""horror"" show for kids that always had some kind of message to leave. It was one of the great kids' shows, before Television would pretty much play anything. It's about a group of friends (the Midnight Society) who met in the woods, every Saturday night, & told scary stories. TV was in a differnt place back then & I'm glad that they released this on DVD, because I kids of today have a chance to experience a great show.",1215302400,,559,4.384615384615385
8161600,5,B000LDED9K,"When I was growing up this was one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I always loved scary movies. This is very good for young adults. It is scary but not so much that it would terrify you, and not so gruesome you would have nightmares. I decided to purchase this for my 2 kids, because they also love horror movies. So I wanted a way they could enjoy without all the gore. They love it and can't get enough of it.",1211068800,,416,3.9642857142857144
