7936093,2,B00005ATFD,"Unfortunately, one of the DVDs offered is a DVD-R format. (Ive also reported the inaccurate product information). DVD-R is notoriously finicky with compatibility issues and less dependable than pressed discs. Even my expensive player still had playback problems with the disc as well freezing, stuttering, and dropping out completely at different points. Its sad such a classic, popular film as Spring in Park Lane, the biggest at the British box office in 1948 and one of the most memorable British films is limited like this in certain regions instead of a proper release.",1522454400,,574,5.182795698924731

7936097,5,B00005ATFD,"This is one of the most popular movies in British history.  It has class, style, beauty, and a tasty blend of comedy.  The story is about an aristocrat posing as a footman, for a complex reason, and falling in love with the young lady of the house, the owner's niece.  Michael Wilding is the footman and Anna Neagle is the young woman.  The direction is faultless, the script is good, and the acting is first rate.  Here's something special, especially for fans of postwar English movies.",1171238400,7,488,4.627906976744186
