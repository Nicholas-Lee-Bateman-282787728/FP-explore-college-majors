5963212,5,B00F1RTVWA,"This movie is a gem in Bollywood. I loved the director since watching Udaan so I decided to check this one out too. It's wonderful. I was never fan of Sonakshi but she really blew me away in this film. Ranveer is good as well and almost unrecognizable in his role. The songs are beautiful, the story is well written and the movie was well directed. I loved the Bengali setting too. But that was just a double plus for me. Sometimes I really wish Bollywood would produce more movies like Lootera and Udaan.",1403913600,,505,4.382978723404255

I could have misunderstood something that led to my dislike of the story. And, I would like to go on record to say that my criticism is isolated to the storyline. I thought the acting, cinematography, etc. was great. )
***Spoilers!!! Be forewarned!!

Rats!! I was so mad when I finished this film! Nowhere did I read that this was a tragedy!! Otherwise, I wouldn't have watched it! I read that there was a ""uplifting ending"" so I assumed that if I trudged through the bog of misery along with our heroes that eventually something good would happen to bring meaning to their suffering.(""David Copperfield"", ""Gone With The Wind"", ""War and Peace"" style.) Now, I like a good bittersweet and life-is-a-struggle story; however, this ending felt pointless!! I still don't get it.
***Spoiler!!! At the end, the guy is dead and the girl is dying of T.B. (was the paper leaf supposed to keep her alive?) And he died to save her and atone for his evil ways. But Umm...HE CAUSED her problems to begin with!! So, basically everyone is happiest in the beginning... and it goes downhill from there.",1402358400,6,1188,4.766990291262136
5963214,5,B00F1RTVWA,"This is a wonderful story which was incredibly written, acted and filmed. I totally recommend it. Beautiful to watch. See it.
Not all dvd players will play this. I can show it on my player at home but when I take it to someones house to show it, it stops about 45 minutes into the movie and won't go further. I was going to buy another copy but have read on others' reviews that they could only play this on a computer and some not even there. What a shame. It is a wonderful story.",1392595200,,482,4.08421052631579
5963215,4,B00F1RTVWA,"This movie starts with a very gentle love story, but everything is not as it seems. Everything aspect of this movie is incredible from the plot to the scenery. The use of silence in this film was brilliant. The actors did an excellent job of conveying their emotions without a lot of dialogue. Overall, this is an excellent movie that is extremely underrated.",1390694400,,359,4.714285714285714
5963216,5,B00F1RTVWA,"In viewing Lootera, it's suggested you have a hankie or three within snatching distance. Lootera is an Indian period film and, in how it presents its pace and its visual palette and its background scoring, exudes a certain old world charm. The two leads are challenged with the most dramatic roles in their young careers, and I think they rise to the occasion - Sonakshi Sinha, more so than Ranveer Singh. If you've a scale and you're balancing the merits of Bollywood cinema, Lootera weighs to what's good about the industry. This is a very polished production. It'll crack your heart to bits.

The film transports us to the year 1953 as young archaeologist Varun Shrivastav (Singh) of Delhi arrives at the village of Manikpur in West Bengal. Varun hopes to excavate the temple grounds of the local Zamindar (or ""landlord""). He believes the ruins of an ancient civilization lie buried beneath. The Zamindar (Barun Chanda) is so taken with Varun that he invites him to reside at his mansion. There, Varun renews acquaintance wih the Zamindar's only daughter, the spirited Pakhi Ray Chowdhury (Sonakshi Sinha). See, they'd met earlier when Pakhi, fledgling car driver, sort of careened into his motorbike.

Lootera has bits of it inspired by O. Henry's 1907 short story, ""The Last Leaf,"" although the nod doesn't pay off until near the end. But maybe there's a frisson of foreshadowing when Varun breaks out that blank canvas.

It's gradually made apparent that Varun is hiding something. He exhibits a reserved demeanor; he's closed in. But his wit and quiet charm are appreciated by the Zamindar and intrigue the sheltered Pakhi.

As in the best romances of Indian cinema, deepest tragedy rips thru the narrative. The film's second movement finds our principals relocated from the dusty warmth of Manikpur to the desolate, snow-capped moodiness of Dalhousie. I guess it's here that I'll sneak in my propers to the cinematographer. If you were to take stills from this film and present them in some art exhibition, you may get some ooh-and-aahers. This is such a beautiful film to look at.

The supporting cast is terrific, notably Barun Chanda as the regal Zamindar and doting father and Vikrant Massey as Varun's lively best friend and archaeological assistant. But it's the scorching chemistry between Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha that glues our eyeballs to the screen, our butts to our seats. Singh does well in a restrained performance. But Sonakshi is the eye-opener. There's a tonal shift from the first and second halves of the film, and Sonakshi's temperament shifts accordingly. What stays constant is her level of professional acting, which to me is remarkable. Wait, I take that back. In the second half, a devastated Sonakshi Sinha becomes luminous to me. She braves the deeper waters of her craft, and in so doing she's deservedly become the critics' darling.

Vikramaditya Motwane directs Lootera, and you may be asking who is he and why is he hogging all the letters in the alphabet? You wouldn't be asking who he is if you'd seen his acclaimed earlier work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Udaan/dp/B0041ETK0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Udaan</a>&nbsp;(2010). Mr. Motwane is a very promising director in world cinema. I love the choices he makes in Lootera. I love the quiet lyricism he evokes. I love that, time and again, he uses silence to punctuate those emotional beats. Leisurely passages elapse in which no dialogue is traded and the background score is relied on to either subtly accentuate a moment or take over in lush paroxysms. Lootera is a technical triumph. But that's a plaudit that seems so clinical. It doesn't touch on the grace and sensitivity that went into the storytelling or the thoughtfulness of the actors' approach or the bone-deep emotions dredged up. The Kleenex Co. should sponsor Lootera. This movie's gonna make it heaps of money.",1390176000,4,3925,5.134585289514867
5963217,5,B00F1RTVWA,this is a very well done movie. A bit slow at times but other than that Ranbir Singh is very good in this one.,1388448000,,110,3.625
5963218,5,B00F1RTVWA,"I had great expectations of this film, and for me, it did not disappoint.  Leading man Ranveer Singh shows that he's up to the task of more than the exuberant comic hero roles that have made him a star in mainstream Hindi cinema.  Cast here as a conflicted loner, he gives the best performance of his career to date.  No dancing, no muscles, and few smiles here; just a spot-on characterization that draws us in and makes us constantly wonder what Varun's truth is.  Sonakshi Sinna is also impressive as Pakhi, the spirited and beautiful but asthmatic daughter of a nobleman who crosses paths with Varun when he arrives at their estate as part of an archaeological dig.  She plays Pakhi with a wonderful quiet dignity, but with beautifully nuanced moments of humor, emotional depth and physical distress.  The slow-burn chemistry between the leads is utterly believable; we cheer for them in spite of poor odds for a happy-ever-after here.

The wonderful art direction and music also add to the overall effectiveness of the film.  The winter scenes created for 1950's Dalhousie in a muted, almost black & white palette heightened the sense of isolation & desperation of the pre-climactic setting.  The music score throughout was lovely and a perfect support to each and every scene, with music director Amit Trivedi taking the vocals himself on one of his compositions. Director Vikramaditya Motwane has constructed a wonderful film that left me with a tear in my eye, but a smile on my face, and won't soon be forgotten.",1386201600,6,1521,4.864341085271318

8611579,5,B00F1RTVWA,"Spoiler alert:

Someone wrote a review saying they were angry about the ending. Apparently, they either didn't read any reviews telling them that the movie is loosely based on O.Henrys The Last Leaf or didn't bother to read or find out the plot line of the short story itself.

Whats sad is that the completely missed the imagery and, thus, missed the beauty and poignant message about the transformative power of love.

They didn't realize that Ranveers character was rebelling against all hed been groomed to know and believe about himself from his boyhood solely because of his love for Sonakshis character. Here he had committed this atrocious act that arguably brought about her fathers death, ruined her financially and left her abandoned when she herself was struggling for her own life.

He has the opportunity to inflict further pain on her, but chooses instead to remain with her in an attempt to will her back to life. He knows this will bring about his own death, but chooses self-sacrifice rather than escape and further abandonment.

The symbolism at the end is gorgeous. By staying and by creating and affixing the leaf to the tree that can never fall, HE trades himself for the last falling leaf. And, indeed, he does fall: first from the tree and then from law enforcement who shoot him down.

It is a story of redemption and transcendence. We don't know if the leaf he affixes actually keeps her alive, but she certainly understands what he has done and is overwhelmed by his love. That he chooses to die just so he can be with her during those last days is a tremendously healing force for her and she is also transformed and transcended by it.

It is simply beautiful. I love this movie and its message.",1515024000,,1723,4.685430463576159
