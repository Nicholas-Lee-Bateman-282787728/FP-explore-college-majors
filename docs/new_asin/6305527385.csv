7891959,4,6305527385,"This is a really nice, clean, family movie. They don't make many like that anymore. It is now on the favorites list of my youngest grandchild. This purchase was of a used VHS version and it did not disappoint. Plays perfectly and promises many repeat performances. It joins a library of similar VHS movies, some of which I have had and played many times for years, which is more than I can say for the easily-scratched DVD versions.",1385596800,2,432,4.551282051282051

7891963,5,6305527385,"Loved the movie as a family film.  It is meant to be a comedy-clean romance, but I thought it had real meaning as the children learn that rumors started are not always the truth.  Once on learning the truth; they found the meaning of loving people as they are and are willing to help.  I loved seeing the antique cars, as back then I think they made cars with more character than what is made today.  I rate this film a feel good.",1330560000,5,430,4.144578313253012
