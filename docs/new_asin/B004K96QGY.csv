8432615,5,B004K96QGY,"This was a great documentary about the Shroud of Turin shown in 3D. It contained a lot of new and important information that I was unaware of. It was a very fascinating and technically informative documentary. If you are a believer in God, as I am, it bolsters ones belief in God, in particular, Jesus being who He said He was. A must see for both believers and non-believers. If this doesn't change your mind about Jesus nothing will, including a personal appearance.",1317254400,4,468,4.650602409638554

As you open the box and look at the disc, the graphic side also looks professional... but when you flip it over it looks ""strange"". Instead of it being shiny and silver it looks shiny and black. The reason I mention this is because as I watched the disc it managed to ""stall"" at three different times (from three to five seconds) and skip/jump twice during the first half of the show. As for the show itself, I can remember seeing it in younger days on analog TV. I looked forward to seeing it in 3D. The 3D did not disappoint. All ""new"" footage had been done in a good 3D format with 3D titles and 2D footage placed in ""floating"" 3D frames/boxes. Now for the material. This show has a hard time getting started. At the beginning they go on and on about science that we just don't understand... things that are impossible to explain and so on and so on. The part where they actually do talk about the shroud is interesting but by that time you are pretty beaten-up by the can't be explained part. Over all I felt like I was watching some kind of cult movie where ""You Better Join In... Or Else"". The 3D was great but I didn't care for the complete experience of this ""The Fabric Of Time"".",1301961600,9,1310,4.351020408163265
