Film as poetry, experimental uses of film. these films especially menilmontant and les mysteres du chateau du de are imaginative and mysterious art works. they are beautifully photographed, Non narrative cinema the films are hypnotic and powerful. some more than others. Beautiful  black and white photography done by the likes of Man Ray, Kirsonov etc.

I cannot recommend these films high enough to the lover of great  photography, painting and film.",1127779200,14,661,5.378640776699029
2311343,4,B0009PW450,"This features a number of directors better known as painters (Fernand Leger, Marcel Duchamp) or photographers (Man Ray).  For the curious, there is a short Orson Welles film from 1934, fully seven years before Citizen Kane. ""The Life and Death of 9413, A Hollywood Extra"" is on the Library of Congress's National Film Registry of significant American films, as is ""HO"". Mnilmontant, at 37 minutes the longest film in this collection, is considered a masterpiece by some.

Worth exploring, if you like this sort of stuff. You know who you are.

2311344,2,B0009PW450,"Anyone looking for more films along the line of Bunuel or Dali MIGHT enjoy this collection. I am sure that a few film studies teachers will relish this one. The rest of us will be impressed with the sheer banality, pretentiousness, low production values, and tedium of these films. If you are still stuck in a post World War one, ""lost generation"" mindset, these grade B surrealistic, erratically cut, non-linear, anti-clerical (in one case) films may seem cutting edge to you. They now seem dated - both because of their sensibility (who gives a darn about Dada's rebellion against bourgious living when most of us in this post 9/11 world now crave security, comfort, reassurance, civility, and stability? You want Dada? Try sitting in a coffee shop and read the morning paper about suicide bombers blowing up a crowd of children while being forced to listen to a dozen cell phone conversations of varying emotional intensities and volumes going on around you. When public life has become a sea of random and nihilistic violence, disconnection, and rudeness, it is the bourgeois life that we crave, not more people selfishly following their primal instincts (as the Dadaists and Surrealists wanted)). Most of these films were justly forgotten and could have been easily lost to history without any sense of loss on my part. I have seen freshman film students produce better films than the ones here. The subject matter and style is dated. The quality of the films are often faded with soundtracks that sound like they were recorded on old Edison foil cylinders. Get this if you absolutely must but don't expect Un Chien Andalou (at least that one was memorable. These will vanish from your memory quicker than the latest pop music tart's tape loop hit). Mostly for flaky film students who don't have the ability to connect with a large audience because of their own personal autism.",1124928000,14,1883,4.905956112852665
2311345,4,B0009PW450,"As the title suggests, this is a collection of 24 short films of the artistic and experimental genre, ranging from about 10 to 35 minutes in length, and each one quite different from the other.  Some of them have a story that you can follow, while others are meant to be visual expressions of moods and feelings, but all of them are of a high standard and quality, and there is bound to be something to suit most tastes in this eclectic collection.  My first impression was that these short films - most of them silent - have a powerful effect on the senses, not in the least due to the exceptionally good musical accompaniment by the best composers in the business.  Overall, watching these films had a calming and almost hypnotic effect on me, which no doubt was often intended.  Some of the highlights for me were the longer, more complex films such as ""The Life and Death of 9413 - a Hollywood Extra"", ""Lot in Sodom"" (which has been previously released by Image Entertainment with Oscar Wilde's ""Salome"") and ""La Glace a Trois Faces"" (The three-sided mirror) which contain a definite message as well as being poignantly expressive visually.  Then there are themes and subjects focussing on nature, weather, architecture, and a few experiments with tricks and animation.  In other words; never a dull moment - unless you are looking for the usual story film with customary action and editing, in which case this collection might not be your cup of tea.  But for anyone interested in artistic expression in films, the history and development of film, or just for something entirely different, this is an excellent set.  There are good notes on each film on the discs themselves so that you can easily read them first before viewing each film (which will help to understand and appreciate the film and its message) or whichever way you like.  In any case, this is surely an important contribution to film history, and thanks to Kino Video for providing such a fascinating ride through the bizarre and compelling art movements of the 20s and 30s.",1123459200,109,2046,4.740845070422536
2311346,4,B0009PW450,"Pardon the references to 1960's psychedelic rock (Cream and Grateful Dead for those of you who don't know) but they seem perfectly appropriate for this mixed bag of short avant-garde films from the Raymond Rohauer Collection. As befits the title of the collection the vast majority of films offered here are French with a few American and German titles mixed in and even a film from the Netherlands. While these movies reflect Rohauer's personal taste they are also a good representation of what was going on in certain artistic circles at the time.

Of the 24 films offered my personal favorite is the 1926 LA COQUILLE ET LE CLERGYMAN (The Seashell and The Clergyman) from the set's only woman director, Germaine Dulac, which exhibits all the avant-garde tendencies and surreal imagery within a basic storyline that is as relevant today as it was back then. Many of the films are explorations in technique while a couple (Orson Welles' HEARTS OF AGE, EVEN-AS YOU AND I) poke fun at the genre.

Another favorite is the celebrated THE LIFE AND DEATH OF 9413 A HOLLYWOOD EXTRA which has cutting edge technique (though mostly shot on a kitchen table), loads of imagination, and a scathing look at the Hollywood system. I also enjoyed L'ETOILE DE MER (The Starfish) as the best of the 4 Man Ray offerings. Two German offerings stood out as well. They are UBERFALL (Assault) with it's haunted looking protagonist and VORMITTAGSSPUK (Ghosts Before Breakfast) for its imaginative effects and the rare opportunity to see composers Darius Milhaud and Paul Hindemith playing parts in a film.

Speaking of composers, the highest praise goes to the many musicians involved in scoring and performing the background music for this set. The music greatly enhances the viewing experience and in a few instances is better than the film it accompanies. This is a one-of-a-kind offering that all serious lovers of cinema (silent and sound) should obtain and decide for themselves which of the 24 titles they like best. There is much to be learned here and thanks to Kino Video and the Douris Corporation for giving us the opportunity to pursue that knowledge.",1123286400,9,2140,4.938888888888889
2311355,5,B0009PW450,"I was really pleased to buy this collection at a reasonable price.  I am a cinema buff so I love to take a look at the Avant Garde.  It was a real pleasure to find Menilmontant.  I saw this film as a freshman in college and always remembered it.  It was amazing, beautiful and unlike any film I'd ever seen before.  After seeing it there, I never heard of it and never saw it again.  I was thrilled to see it in this collection and it is a great film.  The musical accompaniment is usually very good though a bit too somber in parts.  It is true that the films have a calming effect on a person and the music was meant to portray that feeling.  I highly recommend this collection.  It is best in small bites and I wouldn't try to watch it as you would watch a feature film.  The shorts require a lot of attention and it can wane after awhile.  Better to appreciate them in short viewings.",1184457600,4,888,4.128654970760234

2311357,5,B0009PW450,"This is one of the best film collection ever put together. All the films are extremely interesting and most of them excellent. Mnilmontant alone justifies buying this collection, one of the best films ever made.

The New scores are great and the notes on the films are fairly good. The picture quality varies (from bad to good) and it would have been nice to have a little more extra material. But still, this collection is a must have for anyone interested in film. One of my favorite DVDs.",1157328000,7,491,4.579545454545454
2311358,5,B0009PW450,"If no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of avant-garde films from the 20s and 30s, one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature: this one-of-a-kind-combilation, indeed, is ""indespensable""!

For anyone interested in or in some way connected to film and film studies this box set is a true gem as well as an overwhelming visceral experience. One dare even call it ""edenic"".

Packed with cinematic treats - ranging from early classics as Joris Ivens' ""Regen"", through film historical curiosities as Marcel Duchamps' ""Cinema Anmic"" and Richter's ""Rhytmus 21"" to absolute rarities such as Kirsanoff's ""Mnilmontant"" - this impressive collection of short experimental films guides you through all main avant-garde genres of the 1920s and 1930s. From impressionist masterpieces (""Mnilmontant"", ""La glace a trois faces"" [Epstein]), through dadaist art-films (Duchamps), French and German cinma pur/Absolut Film (""Symphonie Diagonale"" [Eggeling], ""Rhytmus 21"" [Richter]), futuristic statements (""Ballt mecanique"" [Leger]), dazzling city symphonies (""Regen"") to such seminal early sound experiments as ""Romance Sentimentale"" (Eisenstein & Alexandrov) and ""Le tempestaire"" (Epstein).

While some films may, indeed, only be labled ""curiosities"" others are sheer strokes of genius - my personal favorites being Kirsanoff's rare impressionistic gem ""Mnilmontant"" (with its impressive - in every sense of the word - use of constant P.O.V.-shots, concealing the first person) and Jean Epsteins masterpiece ""Le tempestaire"" whose use of suspense-generating musique concrte (or ""Slow-Motion Sound"", as it were) and vividly, picturesque imagery make for a unique cinematic experience. - As visceral as it is beautiful to behold.

If only for its lack of a few early classics (notably, Ren Clair's ""Entr'act"" [1924] and Luis Buuel's ""Un chien andalou"" [1929] and ""L'ge d'or"" [1930]) this combilation of early experimental films may not be labeled ""perfect"".

However, I am still to experience any other collection of its kind. For anyone studying film (whether by themselves or in University,) this box set may, indeed, only be ascribed the adjective ""indespensible"", as done also by a previous reviewer.",1152576000,17,2206,5.775384615384615
2311359,5,B0009PW450,"Let it be said that if your interests somehow brought you to seek out more information about this release, it's probably for you.  Things happen for a reason, and your instincts have led you to the right place.

Other reviewers are correct in saying there is something in this collection to suit just about anyone's tastes, but that said, some films will inevitably be of less interest to some.  To my taste, most of the American films (excluding one by Orson Welles and one entitled ""Lot in Sodom"") seem far less innovative and interesting, as they often lack the progressive (and somewhat abstract) artistic sensibilities more common throughout Europe at the time.

Personal favourites are films by artists not entirely devoted to the filmic medium:  Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp come to mind, as well as the excellent German expressionist and Dadaist films (Ghosts Before Breakfast and Uberfall).  To me, it is refreshing to see films which don't rely on predictable plots and linear storylines, and which are often photographically stunning and emotively striking.  It's also nice to have a collection that allows you to watch three films in fifteen minutes, or an hour and a half.  This is a set I keep coming back to, and is one of my most prized sets of early film.",1147910400,8,1270,4.820276497695852

2311361,5,B0009PW450,"For those who are interested, this DVD will not disappoint.  Featuring some of the more noteworthy works from the Raymond Rohauer collection, this is an experience into cinema which is rather profound... and rapidly disappearing.

Movies have long gotten into their stride of being straight-forward narratives, with the likes of Quentin Tarantino coming across as ""avant-garde"" because he happens to edit his movies into a different chronology.  Don't get me wrong, I love QT's work, but there's stuff like this and other works out there (Sam Brakhage, e.g.) that don't really get viewership because there's not much of an audience looking for really experimental and creative stuff.

Not everything on this collection should pre-emptively be considered wonderful or brilliant.  It is, afterall, experimental cinema, and experiments do tend to fail.  But for those looking for things outside the norm, imagery that just doesn't exist in contemporary works, non-narrative explorations of shape, form, patterns, or meta-narrative documentaries full of science fictiony conceits, or more, this is a good starting place.

2311362,5,B0009PW450,"First, I recommend the majority of these films wholeheartedly.  While the present-day soundtracks may in some cases be inappropriate, I find this is often the case with releases of silent films, & we are of course free to mute it & enjoy the visual elements on their own.  The picture quality is good, & in purchasing a collection of silent films that's really the best one would hope for.

With regards to the review of Jmark2001, I think it's worth pointing out how important these films - & the avant-garde in general - really are in these times.  Overlooking the inherent limitations of technology during that era, & the superficial stylistic idiosyncrasies that mark the films as a product of their time, the films of the Dadaists, Surrealists, & Constructivists have a great deal to offer anyone less than satisfied with the status quo.  Far from the high art pretentiousness Jmark2001 accuses them of, these filmmakers were essentially concerned with rebellion, with creating a valid alternative to the decadent, insular consciousness of the middle class.  This manifested itself in experiments with the physical material of film (thus the ""erratic cuts"" & ""non-linear"" style), as well as in the subject matter (including the - Dear God! - ""anti-clerical"" approach).  While certain techniques have been overused since then by uninspired academic followers, here they are largely employed intelligently & - particularly in the films of Eisenstein, Man Ray, & Duchamp - with the utmost care toward their effects on the overall film.  Few of these have been deemed ""classics,"" but few have been easily available for viewing until fairly recently, so I certainly don't see that as any judge of quality.

Jmark2001 also displays the most basic misunderstanding of Dadaism & its revolt on bourgeois values.  The ""sea of random and nihilistic violence, disconnection, and rudeness (!)"" Jmark2001 cites as characterising modern public life is in fact the direct result of craving the trappings of ""bourgious living"" [sic].  Jmark seems to equate Dada (& presumably any experimental, avant-garde art) with terrorism, & suggests that passive consumption of daily horrors in the comforts of a coffee shop is just as effective as Dada's shocks to consciousness.  Well, do I really need to state that the 9/11 terrorists weren't Dadaists?  There is nothing avant-garde about the methods or beliefs of the terrorists; & by the same token, anyone who is satisfied with the ""security, comfort, reassurance, civility, and stability"" our modern society has provided us with, post-9/11, is simply kidding himself.

We require more than ever a vision of life which neither insulates us from the world nor forces us to comply with an imposed set of ideals; which encourages active participation rather than passive consumption; & which gives the viewer's intelligence the benefit of the doubt by working in turn towards radical innovation.  Without experiment, cinema is not worth watching.

& for the record, if, like Jmark2001, all you could derive from Un Chien Andalou was that it was ""memorable,"" I would strongly recommend watching it again, WITH EYES WIDE OPEN.",1135468800,24,3154,5.179133858267717
2311363,3,B0009PW450,"The musical accompaniment for most of these seminal avant-garde films is very bad. A previous reviewer mentioned that it was done by ""the best in the business."" Well, I am of the opinion that, unfortunately, there are not enough interesting minds in that business (silent film scoring), or at least not enough employed by Kino Video, to make for a competent collection.

There is electric guitar (Creed-style riffing!!!). There is arbitrary ""Frenchy"" sounding music. And yes, there is even some dreaded Casio keyboard ""vox"" effect.

Who could possibly think that keyboard ""vox"" was a good idea? Not me.

These films, like all those Kino releases, are rare and under-appreciated, and worth owning on DVD because this is the only way you'll get them. I only wish Kino appreciated them enough to pair the films with either a) historically accurate or b) competent scores.",1130976000,90,868,5.055944055944056

This is a ""must own"" for fans of the heroic first period of experimental filmmaking. The technical quality of the transfers is excellent- a rarity among titles in this genre. The music mixed with the silent films mostly works. The one exception is the track for Ballet Mecanique- the original score by Anthiel exists and is much more appropriate. One can only hope there is an audience for these poetic and wonderfully innovative films.",1129334400,4,551,4.872340425531915
8065097,1,B0009PW450,"Film is an audio-visual medium. While the films in this collection are excellent and in acceptable quality, the choice of musical scores to accompany them is horrible. I can hardly believe that the curators of the collection thought it would be a good idea to have scores that use cheap MIDI samples, etc. Then there are the miserable historical errors: One of the the selections, Ballet mcanique, actually has a famous original score by George Antheil (an extremely interesting composer and historical figure), which the curators idiotically replaced with some recent hippy-dippy garbage. Same goes for Ivers' Regen which historically has a score by Eisler (and is a subject of Adorno & Eisler's Composing for the Films) -- again replaced by more bewilderingly bad amateur music. These ridiculous errors also make this DVD completely unacceptable for teaching use. It's so pathetic that a collection which goes so far to introduce audiences to the incredibly innovative and compelling film work from the early 20th century is so clueless about the musical selections (as if they didn't matter!!).",1470700800,,1097,5.238636363636363
8065098,3,B0009PW450,"Ive gotten curious about experimental films and have been watching a lot of short examples lately. When working through Flicker Alleys Masterworks of American Avant-Garde Experimental Film 1920-1970, I found quite a few films that I liked but wished that more of them told stories rather than being slice-of-life or completely abstract. (I know that some post-modernists feel that a fondness for narrative is old-fashioned, but Too Bad.) Well, in this collection I got my wishand found that stories don't necessarily help. Most of these early silent films do have stories of sorts, but on the whole I didn't find them nearly as appealing as the best of the ones in the Flicker Alley collection.

Most of these films are about 15 minutes long. All are silent, with music added later. They have few, if any, title cards, so one must guess the story from the actionbut that usually is not hard. All are in black-and-white, as one would expect of early films. Most of them did not seem to do much in the way of film technique that was unusual, but I am no expert, so there may have been subtleties that I missed.

Oddly enough, given my quest for stories, most of the films I liked best in this collection were the more abstract ones. My favorite was Hans Richters Vormittagspuk (Ghosts Before Breakfast), a humorous little piece that should delight any fan of Surrealism; Richters puckish troupe of flying bowler hats recalls Magrittes paintings, for one. Symphonie Diagonale, H2O (a collection of water images), and Ballet Mecanique (which is also in the Flicker Alley collection) were enjoyable examples of completely abstract films. The longer Le Coquille et le Clergyman (The Seashell and the Clergyman) had an unclear story but a dreamlike atmosphere and some haunting images; it, too, was very Surrealist.

One area in which this collection excels is the use of nature images to mirror the moods of human characters. This technique is a central feature of Brumes dAutomne (Autumn Mists), the very similar Romance Sentimentale, and Le Tempestaire (The Tempest-Master), and it plays a major part in a number of the other films as well. If that style appeals to you, you will particularly enjoy this collection. On the whole, though, I think you will find a wider variety of approaches in the Flicker Alley collection.",1467676800,,2318,4.923273657289003

8065100,5,B0009PW450,"Are you into films that are a little on the wild side? Alright! What about films that are just downright ludicrous? Well, if you are, then Avante-Garde cinema is right for you!

I have selected a few of my favorites as recommendations. If you are well versed on the finer points of Avante-Garde and Surrealism in cinema, then my recommendations should provide some interesting insight. If you are a beginner, this can maybe point you in the right direction.

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF 9413, A HOLLYWOOD EXTRA:

Robert Florey and Slavko Vorkapich are responsible for this little ditty. If you are new to the Avante-Garde style, I would highly recommend that you watch this film first seeing as how the narrative is relatively easy to follow. Yes. This is one of those rare Avante-Garde films that actually follows a semi-coherent and surprisingly straight-forward story. Not only is 9413 moderately accessible, but it is really a brilliant piece of work.

9413 is an incredibly well done film, and a deeply personal experience on behalf of the spectator. The imagery and symbolism used in the film are not very hard concepts to grasp, making it a wonderful entry-point for those who are new to the cinematic style. It is a wonderful gateway into the world of the Avante-Garde.

Did you enjoy 9413? Ready for the next one? Well. Try Man Ray's 1929 wonderful little film titled THE MYSTERIES OF THE CHATEAU OF DICE:

The Mysteries Of The Chateau Of Dice is simply an incredible experience from beginning to end. The film opens with a title card that reads: 'A Roll Of The Dice Will Never Abolish Chance', a sentiment that is repeated both visually and lyrically throughout the entirety of Man Ray's twenty minute expedition into the heart of phantoms.

The Chateau Of Dice opens on a mannequin hand wielding a pair of dice. As if to symbolize humanity's wooden-hollow grasp on chance and assumes that fate considers all living things to be inanimate objects. We cannot stop fate. It is revealed that a faceless couple is rolling the dice in order to decide first if they will leave the house that day and secondly where. The dice answers the duo and they leave, driving out into the open and vast world. The camera work may seem to become less and less consistent on their lengthy drive, but this is all part of the point. The camera gets shakier and shakier the further the duo descend into the unkown. Meaning, our vision loses sight of itself once we alter our own path and seek out the unexpected. In fact the spectator is moving faster than the characters are seeing as how we arrive at the Chateau at least fifteen minutes before the characters ever do.

Since the audience got there early, we look around at all the strange sculptures and the remarkably twisted architecture that make up the Chateau. We are reminded of a strange destiny that brought us here. One thing is wrong. After a while the spectator realizes he is all alone, and there is nothing he or she can do about it. We begin to ask ourselves questions like ""Where Are We""? as our equilibrium descends into a spinning blur of confusion, occasionally fixing itself, but ultimately losing sight of the question. Day and night become interchangeable, the sun sets, the night leaves in an instant, we are still very much alone, and that's when we start to ask the right questions.

We finally start to wonder whether or not phantoms exist. If a physical action done in the physical world, does it leave a trace of itself?

It's morning and the spectator has found a small group of people to latch onto. They are playing with large and seemingly fuzzy dice. These are people of the more playful variety. Playing with chance. It is also very important to note that unlike the earlier duo's faces which were completley void of personality and depth, this current group's faces are not completely souless. It is still hard to make out the finer points of their facial features, they are still faceless in a sense, but not nearly as much as the earlier duo were. We are reminded by a title card about using dice to abolish chance. It never happens.

The small group of people, two women and two men, go for a swim. The women keep their faces underwater so as not to reveal their true selves. A title card flashes that reads: 'Swim Cinema'. We are shown reflections of the pool on the wall overlooking it, the shadows of the characters are swimming, and the shadow-play demonstrates quite effortlessly the truth about what Man Ray was telling to tell us about phantoms. They do exist, all you have to do is look for them. This is one of the stand-out scenes for me, I think it looks remarkable.

Once the group have finished with their dip in the pool they proceed to pose for the camera doing a handful of ridiculous things and wearing some ludicrous appartus that reminds us of a beauty salon. The character's faces progressively become more well-defined. What we can gather from this slow reveal of their faces is that the more physical traces we leave on this earth, the more our identities become clearer to the public eye. The more we do, the more the world knows about us, the more fate and chance knows about us, and the more the spectators know about us.

The group gets understandably tired from having an exhausting day of leaving their mark on the intrinsic universe and go to sleep. All together they literally fade away into oblivion. Were they phantoms? Was this scenario a phantasm? The Chateau Of Dice holds many mysteries.

Finally, the duo from the beginning of the film catches up with their audience and arrives at the Chateau. They find a pair of dice in the grass, and give it a roll to see whether or not they shall remain there or not. The dice answers them, they shall remain. They scale the roof and inexplicably freeze like living statues. Or how Man Ray would like us to see them, they freeze in place like physical prints of themselves. Their essence remains. And that is all the world sees of us. It is also a clever observation on movie-going. When an audience sees a film, they are forced to believe that the scenario in which they are watching play out is happening in real time right there in front of them, when in actuality it is a the documentation of the physical remains of a group of creative people participating in an activity. Well, aren't films real? Do they not have life? Are there not living and breathing emotions trapped inside each and every frame? I'm sure there are. With The Mysteries Of The Chateau Of Dice, Man Ray asked us, 'Do Phantoms Exist'? And he taught me that not only do they exist, but everything I do in this world adds to the ongoing haunt that is human activity. A wonderful film, and one of my favorite pieces of Avante-Garde cinema.

Next we have the lovely 1928 splash by Hans Richter: GHOSTS BEFORE BREAKFAST

Ghosts Before Breakfast opens with a title card that reads: The Nazis Destroyed The Sound Version Of This Film as 'Degenerate Art'. It Shows That Even Objects Revolt Against Regimentation'. After that the films spits us out into 9 whole minutes of twisted symbolism, dazzling photography, and startling ideas. One of the very first images we see is that of young man putting on a bow tie. The bow tie rebels against him, refusing to be tied down. So much so, that the necktie actually unties itself and flies away from the young man, in a beautifully flowing sequence of stop-motion trick photography.

If Ghosts Before Breakfast is constant in one basic idea, its the idea of breaking free and splitting apart. Which is something all of the objects do, except for the objects that symbolize something violent. Violence is the only real thing that sticks with its own kind and never splits apart from its destined route. The imagery is downright overwhelming at times, but slows down for moments at a time to show us the same four hats avoiding capture from fervent young men aching to catch them. The hats, at this point, represent the idea of rebellion. You can never trap it, catch it, or stop it. Rebellion, like Violence, is an unstoppable force of nature.

The actions in the world of Ghosts Before Breakfast seems to be orchestrated by an omnipotent clock. You can't stop time. Time is the ruler of all. We shown a bulls eye being split apart, not by a bullet, but by the very lines that define it. When a  man's goal is blurred, his aim becomes twisted.

Then Breakfast is served, and those rebellious little bowler hats fly up to the table. A quartet of ghosts appear, the hats belong to them. The hats latch on to their masters, and their masters enjoy their breakfast.

I recommend Ghosts before Breakfast to all fans of the Avante-Garde, and at 9 minutes, it really isn't asking all that much of you, granted you are interested.

And the last film I have selected is a little known Surrealist gem from Orson Welles and William Vance called THE HEARTS OF AGE.

The Hearts Of age is an altogether wholly entertaining experience. As a viewer you're not sure whether what you are being shown are pf the visionary variety or if its all just a meaningless exercise on behalf of Orson Welles. The Hearts Of Age was made in 1934 when Welles was only nineteen years old, which makes The Hearts Of Age the debut film from the legendary Orson Welles. And it is quite a sight to behold.

The Hearts Of Age is a film I like to revisit every so often as it is truly an entertaining film. The images are loosely tied together, but are still set up in an otherwise coherent pattern. I find The Hearts Of Age to be a very important film in Welles' stunning catalog of directorial efforts. It is very interesting to see the man, the myth, the legend do something that is so far removed from what you would normally associate yourself. If nothing else, The Hearts Of Age is a refreshing and joyful experience, and another notable film from the cinema of the Avante-Garde.

Well then.

I hope you enjoy some of the films I have selected. Avante-Garde is an acquired taste, it is a whole new language of film, and at first it can be very difficult to decipher and communicate with. But once you do, you will be granted access to some of the most interesting and enduring films ever made. Once again, I hope you enjoy these films and thanks for reading.",1369267200,,10281,4.595199127114021
8065101,5,B0009PW450,"Let's face it - movie buffs are an eccentric lot, and I'm no exception. I believe that a true lover of cinema doesn't limit his or her appreciation to the conventions of plot and performance. After all, you get that sort of thing in a theatrical production. Movies, by their very nature, have the capacity to go beyond mere convention which, surprisingly, they haven't done often enough in their more than a century of existence.

 The point behind surrealist, experimental cinema is all about the photographed, moving image and the intimate, dreamlike feelings it has the power to evoke when taken out of the confining context of a logical, coherent plotline. Light and shadow, composition, juxtaposition, and shapes, take on precedence exactly as in a painting with the additional, all important element of movement. This isn't to say that some semblance of story can't be present; it can, but it's always subservient to the imagery which acts as narrative in place of title cards and/or spoken dialog. This is cinema in its absolute, purest form. These films also explored subject matter, themes, photographic techniques, and structural and editing styles that broke a lot of so-called ""rules"".

Some of the best experimental filmmakers of the 1920's and 30's are represented in Kino's fascinating AVANT GARDE Deluxe Two-Disc Edition. These works are all from that brief heyday of surrealist cinema, and have been compiled from the Raymond Rohauer Collection's excellent quality prints. In watching these short masterpieces, which went largely unseen by the general public of the day, one sees how they influenced independent and even some mainstream directors -  especially those of the 1950's and 60's - who studied their visual aesthetic and incorporated it to varying degrees in their own work. It's fair to say that the avant-garde films of the 20's and 30's helped propel creativity and imagination in cinematic art in general, although they may not have been credited enough for doing so.

Most highly recommended.",1361664000,,2024,5.158536585365853

(I once read that Chaplin had acting classes at the Coronet in the thirties.)  I was used to the usual Hollywood formula films. However, when I started watching these experimental films, it opened up a new world of imagination for me. I'm so happy that this DVD was created showing these most original films which I find still fresh and original over fifty years later.",1343779200,,490,4.568181818181818
8065103,5,B0009PW450,"Unlike the first movies made in America (made by commercial showmen) early cinema in Europe was the domain of the great artists of the time. With clever, innovative experimentation these Dada-ists and Surrealists rapidly took the new medium to a sophisticated level. When Orson Welles stunned American audiences with his ""innovations"" in CITIZEN KANE, he was simply copying the techniques of artful Europeans like Lang and Murnau. This collection takes us back to the very earliest European film work and you are frequently seeing something done for the very first time on Earth. In particular we see the obscure work of the hugely talented Dimitri Kirsanov, who died young and never fulfilled his great potential. In MENILMONTANT, he was the first to master the art of visual story telling without the irritating interruption of the full-screen title cards so prevalent in the silent era. While Dimitri's motion picture poem, BRUMES D'AUTOMNE, includes its original musical accompaniment, many of these silent films have newly composed and added music tracks. Most of them are appropriately conceived and really do add something. I do, however, think the music track for MENILMONTANT is too modern and overpowers this sensitive, delicate photoplay. I recommend viewing that film in its originally intended silence! All in all this disc is a wonderful accomplishment by Kino.",1310774400,3,1375,5.3119266055045875
8065104,2,B0009PW450,"Back in the early 1990s, I stumbled upon a Kino VHS version of Metropolis, and decided to watch it with a couple of friends.  Even as a teenager with a penchant for radical/experimental music, the soundtrack was so abysmal that we ended up watching the entire movie on mute.  In 2003, my girlfriend at the time purchased a Kino DVD edition of Lang's ""Spies"" for me for my birthday; again, the audio was so bad that we promptly returned the film and put the money towards a nice dinner.  The fundamental failures of Kino can be readily comprehended in comparing their version of Metropolis to the recent release by Criterion - Criterion is meticulous in its restoration of movie classics and in its supporting documentation; the quality of their product is throughout superior - from the packaging to the accompanying literature, to the supplemental material.  In fact, Criterion, discovering that a score had been produced specifically for Metropolis, went so far as to both reconstruct and use this score in their re-issue of the film.  If I understand correctly, they are now putting out another version of Metropolis, using recently found and restored footage, bringing it closer to its original form.

By comparison, there is something simply cheep and shoddy about Kino's products.  How they come upon the rights to so many great films, or access to great movie collections, I don't know.  What I do know is that they seem to have absolutely no respect for the films that they distribute.  From the quality of the video, to the canned, electronic and mind-numbingly bad audio, to the packaging; everything in the Kino releases of classical film bespeaks quick profits for poor quality products.  Given my now nearly 20 year history with this company, I must be a dupe for believing that they will ever respect the content of the materials that they are producing.

Needless to say, I gave Kino one more shot when I saw this collection of Avant-Garde Cinema, which I hoped to use specifically in addressing avant-garde film techniques in a class I'm teaching next semester.  The collection does contain some hard-to-come-by classics, and the three-disk collection is relatively comprehensive, considering the source.  I cannot express how disheartened I was (fingers crossed, hoping that this once, Kino would get it right), when I received the same poorly packaged product (the DVDs were already bouncing around inside the sealed, plastic-wrapped containers), and started playing the first disc.  As usual, the video quality was relatively poor, and my ears were once more assaulted by some of the worst, low-budget racket I've ever heard.  In certain instances, the scoring is entirely mysterious (especially in experimental silent FILM, where it is precisely the visual nature of the work that was intended to be the subject), in other instances, it is entirely inappropriate.

So passes another great disappointment at the hands of Kino, who might do better simply pumping out the kind of low-budget classic kitsch camp films that they seem to be fitted for producing, instead of staining truly great works of cinema with their incompetence.  This said, for people interested in this kind of cinema, I say, do not let the low price point of Kino's products sway you - you get what you pay for.  So much is online that the decision to purchase a physical copy of these films should be driven by a desire to own an artifact that preserves and respects the content in high-resolution and with appropriate documentation and sensitivity to the original works.  In other words, save up and invest in a higher quality edition, possibly by Criterion, if offered, or some other distributor who is invested in film, in the history of film and in digitally preserving, restoring and presenting great film in an appropriate format.",1278288000,5,3827,5.007886435331231
8065105,2,B0009PW450,"The music is bad - real bad. I had to run at 2X speed without sound to get through most of them. As a film student I wanted to explore early film and try to see the roots of development and experimentation.

I was disappointed in most of the movies as I was looking for early innovations in film making. I only saw them in Manhatta and H2O. These two made the disk purchase acceptable.

Manhatta has some innivative shots and lighting study. It was able to tell a story of greatness without words in spite of the terrible music. Interesting early camera placement and angles.

H2O had some fascinating play with light and water reflections. I was mesmerized.",1213228800,2,658,4.512605042016807
8065106,5,B0009PW450,"This collection of avant-garde films shows what the medium of film is still capable of yet today. What astonishes is how surprising some of the results here can be from the cameras of such noted surrealist artists as Marcel Duchamp and Ferdinard Lger: the former's ""L'toile du Mer"" seems as new and exciting as it did seventy-five years ago, and the latter's ""ballet Mchanique"" is still very funny. Some of the work by later famous filmmakers is not as impressive as you might hope (an early film by Orson Welles is the style of ""Caligari"" tells us very little about the great works he would later produce), but the collection is worth owning if only for its rare presentation of Dimitri Kirsanov's astonishing 1926 work ""Mnilmontant,"" which Pauline Kael rated as one of the greatest films ever made (and which she late in life was her personal favorite of all movies). Kirsanov shows here how the kind of sophisticated style associated with the Russians such as Eisenstein (though ""Mnilmontant"" was made, almost impossible to believe, before he could possibly have seen ""Potemkin"") might be wedded to the kind of sentimental work more closely associated with D.W. Griffith (the two idealized innocent sisters seem especially in their early scenes reminiscent of the Gish sisters in ORPHANS OF THE STORM). The beginning sequence of the double ax murder in the rural home is one of the most disturbing murders ever captured on film; it stays with you for years later, as does Kirsanov's stunning use of montage to evoke mood, fantasy, or memory as well as strictly diegetic occurrences.",1194134400,2,1585,4.940074906367041
