James Garner's performance as Wyatt Earp is convincing as a lawman caught between revenge for the murder of his brother and the enforcing of the law.  Lots of action. Jason Robards as Doc Holliday is excellent, showing Doc  with a sense of humor but deadly on the draw.

499898,5,6302718961,"You can say that Hour of the Gun is director John Sturges' finest movie, and you won't get a lot of ""Aw, hell, no!"" I think Hour of the Gun is the second-best movie about U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, best being Tombstone. I wouldn't be at all surprised were someone to tell me that Tombstone (1993) took a strong cue from Hour of the Gun (1967).

It's a movie what's ahead of its time. It didn't make bank at the box office during its theater run. People back then just weren't down with Wyatt Earp's ambiguous turn. And I'm pussyfooting when I say ""ambiguous."" James Garner, who plays Earp, stored away his affable side to make this film. There's nothing ambiguous about his motivation. That hombre was seeing red, brother.

If you'd rather, consider Hour of the Gun as the loose sequel to Sturges' earlier take, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). That movie climaxes with that infamous gunfight. This movie opens with it and goes on to chronicle subsequent events. Robert Ryan is cold-blooded as Ike Clanton whose ambitions are thwarted by the Earps, and so he sets out to eliminate them. It's sort of funny that one of his earlier efforts has him staging events so that the Earps could be tried in a court of law. Only when that fails does he resort to the ambush of Wyatt's brothers. Cue Wyatt's embarking on a relentless pursuit of them bushwhackers who shot down his brothers good.

Hour of the Gun is an unflinching scrutiny of a man's descent into corruption, and, no, sir, I ain't talking about Ike Clanton. Garner is at his most flinty-eyed portraying a lawman driven by revenge, his sense of morality now all muddled-up. And I'm amazed all over again at the versatility of this actor, his effortless knack to switch gears and play it dark, play it light, play it gritty, play it smooth. Two years later, Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969) would present a Garner of a different mood, his affable self in full flush.

To repeat, Hour of the Gun was ahead of it time and it did pinkie-swear, at the start, that ""This picture is based on fact. This is the way it happened."" There's more to it than your pedestrian western. There's real grit to this one, and a hard edge. And I guess folks back then just didn't take to Garner's bringing harsh, perhaps apocryphal ""truths"" to such an exalted western hero. But folks today would rather not have the wool pulled over their eyes. Today, we're more apt to accept Garner's compromised version of Wyatt Earp because he seems the realer version. The most sympathetic cat here is Doc Holliday as done by the always awesome Jason Robards. You want an actor who always comes across as real - that's Robards. I still insist that Val Kilmer was the superior Doc Holliday. But you can't at all hate on Robards' interpretation, world-weary and wise and wistful and unrepentant and accepting of his doom. His Doc, himself a scoundrel of the first order, tried so hard to be Earp's conscience, but maybe he should've just stuck with his practice in dentistry or his poker-playing or his gun-shooting. Gripped with consumption, his wasting body wracked with mighty coughs, Doc stayed loyal to the end, even as he nipped at his friend's fallen conscience. He accuses Earp: ""Those aren't warrants you got there. Those are hunting licenses."" And give credit to Earp, he realizes the hypocrisy of his going thru the motions of due process. He acknowledges his manipulating the law in order to serve his own needs, to feed his thirst for personal revenge. And he finally admits, ""I don't care about the rules anymore. I'm not that much of a hypocrite."" Still, when the showdown goes down between him and Clanton, you're left wondering, just like in The Searchers with John Wayne, whether he'll do the right thing or succumb to temptation and duel with Clanton - and by ""duel with,"" I mean ""execute in cold blood"" because in this movie no one's more dead-eye or viperish-fast on the draw than Wyatt Earp.

And if you're not down with the morality play of this movie, then there's always the smartly-staged shoot-'em-ups to perk you up. Stone-faced and implacable, Wyatt Earp does come across as an avenging angel as he chases down them nogoodniks. Doc, too, gets moments to show off his wicked gunplay.

Trivia-heads should note Jon Voight in one of his earliest roles as that dirty skunk, Curly Bill Brocius.

Just as I like think of Hour of the Gun as a loose sequel to Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, I consider Sunset (1988) a loose follow-up to Hour of the Gun. In Sunset, Garner reprises his role of Wyatt Earp and teams up with Tom Mix (Bruce Willis) in 1929 Hollywood to solve a murder.",1469404800,,4638,4.635036496350365

499926,5,6302718961,"The great John Sturgis directed this now classic western.

James Garner is really believable as Earp, not simply playing him as a good guy or hero, but with all the realism and also the ambiguity of the historical Wyatt Earp. A darker role for Garner, who as Maverick and in the  Rockford Files was always so tongue in cheek, fun and likeable. In this role, Garner plays Wyatt with Earp's dark side intact, and one is left with the accurate impression that Wyatt Earp had both a good side and a darker side, ( as we all do), and had an ongoing struggle with this seeming inconsistency in his persona.

Jason Robards is terrific as Doc Holliday, with the sardonic pathos of the historic Holliday, but without overacting the part. He's understated yet a bit bellicose in the role, accomplishing  his portayal of Holliday with a menacing presence at times, with humor at others. His character's loyalty to Earp is obvious, yet their clashes and criticisms of one another seem genuine and heartfelt. Their relationship is not idealized but realistic.

Robert Ryan is at his villainous best as Ike Clanton. Yet again, not overacted at all, but very real. This is a hallmark of the movie; it is written and directed with a realism which embodies all the conflicting aspects of real humans in difficult situations. I give it 5 stars, and from time to time I will always watch it again. It's that well done.",1442361600,2,1399,4.670731707317073

499965,3,6302718961,"Released in 1967, ""Hour of the Gun"" is John Sturges' sequel to his 1957 film ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" Although he used the same production team he had to use different actors due to the length of time between the movies. Unlike other films covering the Earp/Clanton conflict, ""Hour"" starts with the famous gunfight and details the aftermath, focusing on Wyatt's avenging the Clanton's cowardly attacks on Virgil and Morgan.

""Hour"" has so much going for it that I expected a better film. For one thing, how can you go wrong with James Garner as Wyatt? Unfortunately, his performance is decidedly one-note stoical, but it's not James' fault as he was just following the script (I suggest catching him in a Western from a year earlier, the excellent ""Duel at Diablo""). The opening is great with the notable score by Jerry Goldsmith and the well-done gunfight at the OK Corral which, true to history, lasts only 30 seconds, unlike the elongated version of the previous film. But the story immediately bogs down with the complexities of the Earp/Clanton feud. As such, the rest of the film is essentially talk, talk, someone gets shot, talk, talk, someone gets shot, more talk, someone else gets shot, all combined with a lot of traveling across the Arizona countryside in one way or another (horse, train, carriage). I don't mind talk if it's interesting in one way or another, but this talk all centers around the complex conflict at hand.

Jason Robards is quite good as Holliday, but he's too old for the part; in real life Holliday was 30 years-old at the time of the gunfight and died six years later. The Mexican locations are magnificent, but the story is rather convoluted and is only engaging if you're up on the two factions and the characters thereof. Another problem is that there are NO WOMEN, except for a brief flash of the Earp's wives. Nevertheless, ""Hour of the Gun"" is certainly worth catching if you're interested in the Tombstone story and favor the quality cast. Speaking of which, Garner is laconically stalwart while Robert Ryan almost steals the show as the main heavy, Ike Clanton. But the film bombed at the box office and understandably so since the previous film with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas was a long fading memory; people were naturally lost concerning the complicated Earp/Clanton conflict. So I suggest viewing ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" or, better yet, ""Tombstone"" (1993) or ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) before viewing this one. That's what I just did and it helped me savor this version more than on my previous viewing.

On a side note, look closely and you'll spot Jon Voight as Curly Bill in one of his first feature films.

The film runs 100 minutes.

499995,2,6302718961,"I didn't come here as a fan of John Sturges, who had a wonderful career directing genre films, notably westerns such as the well remembered 'Magnificent Seven'.  The historical value, which is emphasized by an early screen claim that 'this is the way it happened' would also be a neutral attraction at best.  Although I've been well entertained by James Garner, especially his humorous portrayal of the title character in the  long running television western 'Maverick', that would be insufficient in itself to watch this; there's little or no humor in Wyatt here.  Wyatt is seen by Doc Holiday as transforming from lawman to personal avenger.  If so, it seems to happen with little or no feeling displayed.  In view of this missing feeling quality, the bond between Doc and Wyatt seems somewhat strange.
'Hour of the Gun' is a good title for this, inasmuch as what is portrayed here is a period during which gunplay was a feature of life in many aspects, not least for ambitious men striving to establish their fortunes in the West and law was being called in by some to counter that.
But despite the opportunity to reflect on that, the movie's real pleasures are few.  One exception: the horses, beautiful and well ridden.",1392681600,3,1224,4.8
499996,2,6302718961,"This film opens with the gunfight at the OK Corral and then tells the story of the assassinations and legal maneuvering that followed. The second half of the picture recreates the infamous ""Earp Vendetta Ride"". where Wyatt Earp tracks down the gang members who murdered one of his brothers and crippled the other. Although the climax is entirely fictional, Director John Sturges stays closer to the known facts than his earlier film, ""The Gunfight at Ok Corral"". Nevertheless, he reduces a political tale of rival factions to a simplistic one of white hats vs. black hats, with only throwaway references to the complexities of the real life story. All this would be fine and good if the movie were better. ""Hour"" never recovers from the limp, boring, and overlong courtroom sequence that follows the opening gunfight. The movie is flat and poorly paced. Basically it is ""talk, talk, shoot someone, talk, talk, someone gets shot"" etc. A grim, one note performance by James Garner as Wyatt Earp doesn't help. Garner shines in roles that exploit his good humor, none of which is on display here. While not as Shakespearean as Burt Lancaster's similar ""straight arrow"" interpretation, Garner's Earp lacks Lancaster's passion and comes across as just a guy with a stick up his ass who can shoot well. The rest of the cast is nearly as boring. Character Actor William Windom adds some brief interest in his introductory scene, but then becomes just another flat character standing behind Garner. It is left to Jason Robards as Doc Holliday to try to give the film any humor or heart, but even he seems a bit too tired to give it his all.

499997,5,6302718961,"Picking up where `Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' left off, `Hour of the Gun' finds Wyatt Earp in the heat of a battle with the Clanton clan.  With Ike Clanton viciously vindictive towards Earp's slaying of his brothers, he exacts revenge in the murder and maiming of Earp's brothers.  This leaves Earp in a precarious position.  A man of the law, he's always done his best to abide by it, but now he is forced to question his conscious as he debates taking the law into his own hands, when the law can't help him any longer.

Directed by John Sturges (who directed `Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' ten years earlier), `Hour of the Gun' is a faster paced film that cuts out the unnecessary and gets right to the meat.  What I really liked about this film is that is fleshed out Earp better than I think most other films on the man have.  In all the films that I've seen on the man, he's always felt like the less interesting character, which Clanton and Holliday being the more intriguing aspects of the film.  Here, it appears that way on the outset (especially since Garner is so stiff in the lead) and yet as the film progresses and Earp's moral compass is questioned, the man (and the actor) start to become more colorful and rich.

`Hour of the Gun' is a great film, one that makes a solid impact and keeps the audience's attention from frame to frame.  It touches upon weighty themes without making them feel too heavy, keeping the focus right where it needs to be and proves that you don't have to be three hours to tell a deep story if you know how to tell it right!",1380499200,,1568,4.342465753424658

499999,4,6302718961,"1967's ""Hour of the Gun"" is a different take on the iconic gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.  In fact, the gunfight is over in the opening minutes of the movie.  Instead, the focus is what happened afterward.  When the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday are absolved in court of any blame over the gunfight, cattle rustler Ike Clanton vows a private revenge.  In the end, it will be left to U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and a small group of deputies to put a rough end to a bloody rivalry, while dodging a posse led by a corrupt sheriff.

Director John Sturgis delivers an austere, minimalist Western, wrapped around the moral dilemma of Wyatt Earp, a sworn officer of the law who finds the law can't deliver justice.  Somehow, the suspects from Clanton's gang keep ending up dead rather than arrested.  As Wyatt Earp heads into Mexico for a final and dramatic showdown with Ike Clanton, it is unclear just how far he might be willing to go on his own vengeance ride...

James Garner plays a conflicted Wyatt Earp, a moral man forced to fight on Ike Clanton's terms.  Jason Robards is surprisingly effective as the cynical, hard-drinking gambler and gunfighter Doc Holliday, in the unfamiliar position of being Wyatt's conscience.  Robert Ryan is equally effective as the hard-eyed Ike Clanton, willing to do anything to avenge his friends.

Hour of the Gun, released in 1967, is John Sturges' telling of the years after the OK Corral shoot-out.  In fact, Hour of the Gun begins with the gunfight overlayed by the opening credits.  James Garner is an excellent Wyatt Earp.  While Earp had a bigger moustache, Garner looks much more like Earp than Lancaster.  The movie tells a story of triumph, revenge, and friendship.  It is a very moving story and one that follows closely, although not completely, what actually happened after the Gunfight.  The inquest courtroom scenes are to me one of the highlights of the movie.  Robert Ryan, one of America's greatest character actors, is without peers in his portrayal of Ike Clanton.  And to me, the one thing that continues to bring me back to this movie over and over again is Jerry Goldsmith's score.  Goldsmith's score to Hour of the Gun is one of his best.  In Goldsmith's long career he probably only scored about twelve westerns, but this one would be at the very top of the list.

500026,4,6302718961,"Oh we do love our westerns, do we not? So many fine, articulate reviews posted for this installment of the Wyatt Earp legend. As it happens I am currently accumulating a collection of two great -almost mythological- stories that are told again and again on celluloid; the saga of Wyatt Earp, and Alice in Wonderland.

Although Wyatt and Alice may seem to occupy disparate niches in the archives of story telling, I propose that they are similar in that each tale acts as something of a template -an archetype- from which various interpretations of the core story can be rendered. It seems somehow ok that liberties have been taken with the exact way the events, either in reality or in the mind of the author, originally occurred in either story. The concepts of good, evil, morality, the impetus to do the right thing (The Wyatt Earp story), as well as the need to make sense of our dreams where the logic and proportion so often fall away (Alice)... are foundational to the human experience. To tell the story of Wyatt Earp or Alice in Wonderland with the characters and events reimagined by the current story teller allows us to examine these same core concepts through the fresh perspective of an individual's own interpretation.

In this terse, eerie rendition of the Wyatt Earp myth it seems that director John Sturges is asking us to compare the morality of the two key players; Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton. Such a comparison is of course done with regularity, but in this case we have the events as they are laid out by Sturges to judge. For example, in this telling of the story Earp kills Clanton. We know it did not actually go down this way, but let's take this version at face value and see where it leads us.

We are being asked whether Wyatt and Ike are in essence the same man (the fact that Sturgis dresses Wyatt in all black lends credence to this assertion). This question is actually fundamental to the Earp myth. In this particular telling, Ike Clanton is described not as a mindless killer but rather a man with a goal --rule the world he is creating on his own terms, free of the interference of the Easterners. Clanton would prefer to work within the law (""if this were back east I could make law the way they do""), but in the end Clanton is willing to use death and violence to reach his goal.

Is it the same with Wyatt Earp? Wyatt generally works within the law. He's even willing to 'make law', such as prohibiting the carrying of firearms within city limits. But once the blood of his kin is in play Wyatt's need for revenge becomes more important than the moral code he has been living by. Still, he attempts to work within the framework of the law. He stretches his morality to the very brink though when he goads his adversaries into drawing down on him. Yet even near the end of the tale when he and Doc track down Ike Clanton in Mexico, Wyatt at first tries to work with the local authorities to apprehend Clanton. Only when the witnesses are killed and there's no chance of a trial to bring justice does Earp -for the first time really- step completely outside the law.

So, is Mr. Sturges telling us that when push came to shove, Wyatt and Ike were exactly alike? And perhaps by inference, that all humans, under the right circumstances, will sacrifice their core beliefs... a juxtaposition of the old adage ""Every man has his price""? No. I don't think so. Hour of the Gun leaves intact a key difference between Clanton's actions and the actions of Earp. Ike was willing to sacrifice the lives of innocent people to reach his goal. He appears to care nothing of either the loss of his own brother or the deaths he sponsored of the innocents who would testify against him. Sturges's Wyatt does not go that far. Even when Earp tricks his adversaries into gun-play over arrest, the argument can be made he did so because they were guilty of a crime and there was no hope of a fair trial. To support that idea we have Doc Holliday's line; ""You couldn't get a conviction in a Federal court or a local one..."".  And Wyatt never killed an innocent man to get to the men guilty of assaulting his brothers. For Wyatt Earp, blood was thicker than law, but even then he did not place himself above the law out of pure self-interest. Vengeance carried out in the name of another rises a few clicks above that.

Therein lies the difference; root motivation, and I would insert that when asked how this tale of the Old West applies in modern life, the reply may be that sometimes men, standing in judgment of one another, don't always take this further step of looking beyond a person's actions and view their core motives. At the end of the day every film that tells the Wyatt Earp saga, from Frontier Marshall in 1934 to Wyatt Earp's Revenge in 2012, begs the question; What would be the right thing to do in such circumstances? What would YOU do?",1343952000,2,4870,4.508493771234428

My primary motivation for buying it was seeing a very young,moustachioed James Garner in a different,more dramatic role. As the movie unfolded I became aware that I was not watching the usual interpretations of the Wyatt Earp legend,where he has been portrayed in film & TV as being whiter than white & the pillar of virtue. It is a much more dramatic movie than the run-of-the-mill movies,up to then,of the Wyatt Earp legend,and much more satisfying from the perspective of the viewer,for being so. It raises questions in the viewer's mind about the truth of what we have been led to believe about Wyatt Earp & his family. James Garner's portrayal of Earp is very grim & humourless;very driven & relentless. Also look for a very young Jon Voigt in a supporting role. A movie well worth seeing.

500029,5,6302718961,"With a stellar cast and John Sturges at the helm, you have a fine Western with great Jerry Goldsmith's music and the beautiful Mexico scenery with photography by Lucien Ballard.  The well crafted script by Edward Anhalt is superb.

James Gardner brings a serious, sardonic and humorless portrayal of Wyatt Earp. His Wyatt Earp is a totally different person than in previous films. Gunfight At The OK Corral (1957-Burt Lancaster); Wichita (1955- Joel McCrea); My Darling Clementine (1946-Henry Fonda); Tombstone: The Town Too Tough To Die (1942-Richard Dix); and Frontier Marshall (1939-Randolph Scott) presented a true American hero without faults, except for a few moments of grief and anger.

Was this bad to present Wyatt Earp as a man struggling with grief and his conscience?  Definitely no!  It works wonderfully in the script because he had to be as he was in Tombstone and Wyatt Earp which used elements of this film.

Jason Robards does Doc Holiday justice.  He stands with Wyatt Earp be it hell or high water.  However, his Doc Holiday grows greatly concern as he sees the man that he admires becoming a merciless killer like himself.

Ike Clanton, ruthless killer and businessman, is brought to life by the great Robert Ryan.  Ryan's Ike Clanton is a clean-cut, well dressed businessman with no conscience and a soul lost in the darkness of cattle rustling and greed.

There are a number of great scenes in this film.  One which stands out is the conversation between Wyatt Earp and Andy Warshaw, played brilliantly by the Steve Ihnat, at the horse corral.  The scene builds to the ultimate climax with a twist.  What follows is pure artistry as Doc Holiday confronts Wyatt Earp over his behavior and reminds him of who he is and what he is becoming. This is pure brilliance in direction, writing and acting.

The story begins at the OK Corral and ends in Denver as Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp says their final good-byes.  It is a poignant farewell as the dying Doc hands Wyatt his US Marshall badge which Wyatt had given to Doc in Mexico.  They know this is the finale of a friendship which few people understood even to this day.

Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp were like oil and water or night and day, but they stood beside each other in thick and thin. Perhaps, it was a friendship born out of necessity and the violent times of the West.  We all could use such friends in our daily struggles on this planet.

This is one of the great films about Wyatt Earp.  Historically, it is closer to the actual events as they happened than the previous films, but certain liberties were taken as well.",1299974400,3,2602,4.699779249448124
500030,4,6302718961,"James Garner, best known for lighter roles, here plays a grim Wyatt Earp in a movie that focuses not on the notorious and still controversial O.K. Corral fight, but on what came afterward.  Hauled into court by prosecutor Octavius Roy (Albert Salmi), Wyatt and his friend Doc Holliday (Jason Robards) and brothers Morga and Virgil (Sam Melville, Frank Converse) are cleared of all charges by a practical-minded judge (William Schallert).  But Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) isn't done with them--not so much because his brother Billy was killed at the Corral, as because he's resolved to gather unto himself enough power so that when ""the East comes West"" he'll be able to face its power brokers on their own terms.  Calling on Curly Bill Brocius (Jon Voigt, then 29 and a relative unknown), Andy Warshaw (Steve Ihnat), and Pete Spence (Michael Tolan), he has one of Wyatt's brothers assassinated and the other crippled for life.  Now Wyatt sets out to even the score, with Doc at his side.

Although probably much closer to the reality than many of its predecessors (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Darling-Clementine/dp/B00005JLUH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Darling Clementine</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunfight-at-the-O-K-Corral/dp/B00008CMR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunfight at the O.K.

(It also ignores the existence of two other Clanton brothers, Phin and Sam; their father died the same year as the battle took place.)  What's most intriguing is the relationship of Wyatt and Doc: the latter seems to serve as the former's conscience, determined that he not be allowed to kill needlessly.  (Among the best parts of the movie is the sequence during which Doc rounds up a couple of reluctant but very useful ""deputies,"" Texas Jack Vermillion and Turkey Creek Johnson (William Windom, Lonny Chapman).)  Monte Markham has a small but very well-done part as Sherman McMasters, the Sheriff of Tucson, who makes up the fifth member of Wyatt's posse, and there's a lot of good focus on the leading citizens of Tombstone, who want to help Wyatt but are sometimes balked by the law and sometimes refused by Wyatt himself.  (Caveat: though the Tombstone sheriff (Bill Fletcher) is here called Jimmy Bryan, his rela name was John ""Johnny"" Behan.)",1288396800,4,2529,5.545454545454546

First the story plodded along and seemed disconnected. It lacked a flow and did not build up to the final showdown. In Gunfight at the OK Corral, the story built to the big battle with minor incidents that feed the build up. Here everything seemed like separate events.

James Garner (who I really like) did portray a much different Wyatt Earp but I think he was much too stoic. I think he over did the emotionless aspect of the character.

Jason Robards was not very good a Doc Holiday. I think he did not bring out any real character attributes for us to understand Holiday's motivation.

The story said it followed the real life events, but it deviated in signficant ways. Earp never shot Ike in Mexico.

500047,5,6302718961,"After watching carefully the other two most acclaimed versions about the legend of Wyatt Earp and his inseparable Doc Holiday (Gunfight in the Ok Corral and Tombstone), I am certain to state this is the closest approach about the truth about this incident.

Jason Robards Jr. steals the show all the way through as the cynical and unworried Doc Holiday (mirror's image) of his admired hero. Earp has always acted inside the boundaries of the law. But when his two brothers are murdered by Clanton's gang, his attitude before the law will experience a sudden twist of fate.

The initial sequences in the Court show how the justice favors him and then ignores (due lack of evidence). And so, when the honest Sheriff is legally elected is murdered immediately after the result is known and that fact determines in his behavior a point of no return.

Earp claims for vengeance, an embarrassing way to apply the law but into his mind and honor there`s no escape. He must become himself judge and executioner at the same time.

James Garner is absolutely convincing like Wyatt and Robert Ryan - a true veteran in these roles- (remember him in The naked spur or the implacable prosecutor in the Wild Bunch) is absolutely outstanding like the ruthless and straightforward gangster, who acts like a true Ambassador of the Italian Mafia (making an exercise of imagination for those times).

The script is agile with plenty of action all the way through. The dialogues are fresh and concise. You won't find any single scene. Everything fits piece over piece.

After you watch this film, I think you (like me) will have to include this Western among the top twenty westerns ever made.

Jason Robards is the best Doc Holiday you will ever see. His sadness when he sees the decline of his friend is understated but powerful.

500050,3,6302718961,"For Sturges, the West was a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorsed the point...

Sturges believed there were three essentials to every Western: 1. Isolation - a man standing alone with no hope of help from outside (e.g. Spencer Tracy's predicament in ""Bad Day at Black Rock when the telegraph lines are cut). 2. A man, or group of men compulsively take law and justice, rightly or wrongly, into their own hands (e.g. ""The Magnificent Seven""). 3. The issues are resolved by violence in the form of gunplay (e.g. ""Gunfight at the OK Corral,"" ""Hour of the Gun""). He followed this up by saying: 'A Western is a controlled, disciplined, formal kind of entertainment. There's good and bad; clearly defined issues; there's chase; there's a gunfight.'

""Hour of the Gun"" covers the period just after the famous gun battle... The film is well done but there are some downfalls: It shows only one face of Wyatt-- his ""official"" law abiding side, with no women in his life... And also no Johnny Ringo--the main bad guy and rival of Doc Holliday...

There are solid performances all around, beginning with James Garner who plays a hero with a badge, and is powerful in his intensity... Wyatt's vengeance for the murder of his brother show the primal potency of violence...

Robards plays John Holliday--an ordinary man dying of tuberculosis who becomes one of Wyatt's most loyal allies with an insatiable greed for drinking, gambling and fighting... Robards is quite good in his character, and does deliver a couple of colorful lines to Earp... The relationship and chemistry between the two men is unique... It's difficult to outline, but it's like these two were old souls who would go through hell with/for each other and never need to wonder or to argue it...

Ryan, as a Westerner, has played straight as well as crooked - his hunted killer in ""The Naked Spur"" and his ageing lawman (losing his vision at crucial moments) in ""The Proud Ones"" being equally memorable... In more recent roles he has been basically sympathetic - as the horse-handler in ""The Professionals,"" as William Holden's weary, reluctant pursuer in ""The Wild Bunch,"" as the pacifist sheriff in ""Lawman"" - the exception being ""Hour of the Gun,"" in which once again he was the outlaw on the run, this time with a relentless Wyatt Earp in pursuit...

500051,4,6302718961,"""Hour of the Gun"" was one of the first attempts to accurately portray Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and the bloody aftermath which followed. The movie begins with an exciting and fairly-accurate reenactment of the historic gunfight. The rest of the film itself is fine, but a tad bit uneven in its storytelling and characters. The story drags a bit, but picks up when the guns are drawn. It's also a tad historically inaccurate, though films of the time never tried too hard to be correct to the events like they do nowadays.
The performances in this film are hit-and-miss. James Garner's performance is, sadly, one of the film's weaknesses. Now, Garner is a terrific actor, but his Wyatt Earp is never brought to full life, as was done by Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner in later films. Robert Ryan plays Ike Clanton, but should have been given the character of Pa Clanton, as he is too old to play Ike, who was 34 at the time of the O.K. Corral. Ryan does the best he can, but his villain never becomes fully believable or menacing.
The best performance belongs to Jason Robards, who gives a terrific performance as Dr. John ""Doc"" Holliday. He is both funny and at times dark and menacing. His performance should go side-by-side with Dennis Quaid and Val Kilmer, other men who gave fantastic performances as Holliday. The rest of the supporting cast is fine, though they are given little to do in a film that focuses on Earp, Holliday and Clanton.
Overall, this is a fine filmed depiction of the events that took place in the aftermath of the O.K. Corral. Despite its flaws, its definitely worth a look, if not much else.

Wallis production of ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" Although Sturges' ""Hour of the Gun"" boasts greater visual and historic realism than ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" this sequel of sorts veers off course toward the end and two-time Oscar-winning scenarist Edward Anhalt of ""Becket"" contrives scenes that are not historically accurate principally for the sake of dramatic license to provide audiences with closure. Unlike the Paramount release that featured Rhonda Fleming as Wyatt Earp's love interest, Sturges dispenses with women altogether in this United Artists release and confines himself to the feud. The practically all male cast features lean, rugged Robert Ryan as Earp's chief real-life nemesis Ike Clanton and in his second motion picture lanky Jon Voight of ""Midnight Cowboy"" fame. Indeed, as much as possible Anhalt and Sturges have tried to stick with history. For example, the dialogue in the courtroom sequences came verbatim from the actual transcripts. Moreover, unlike previous Wyatt Earps, James Garner is allowed to play the legendary lawman without a halo. This Earp wants to kill out of brotherly vengeance than take the villains in to stand trial. After all, the tagline for the film reads: Wyatt Earp - hero with a badge or cold-blooded killer? Known for the affable screen characters that he played over the years, Garner makes a great change of pace as a vengeful Earp in a taut, grim-faced performance unlike anything that he had done before and not again until he starred in Vic Morrow's spaghetti western ""A Man Called Sledge."" The action opens on the main street of Tombstone as our black-clad in business suited heroes: Wyatt Earp (a mustached James Garner), Doc Holiday (two-time Oscar-winner Jason Robards of ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), Morgan Earp (Sam Melville of ""Big Wednesday""), and Virgil Earp (Frank Converse of the TV show ""Movin' On"") march down to the O.K. Corral after Ike Clanton's gunmen have assembled for the fateful showdown. The shoot-out is over in a mere matter of minutes. During the shooting, Ike Clanton ducks into a photography shop and sits out the gun battle. Morgan takes a slug in the shoulder while Virgil receives bullet in the leg. After the gunfight, County Sheriff Jimmy Ryan (Bill Fletcher of ""5-Card Stud"") and his deputy Frank Stilwell (Robert Phillips of ""The Dirty Dozen"") confront the Earps and Holiday. Ryan tries to arrest them. ""Not today, tomorrow, or ever,"" growls Wyatt. ""You don't have jurisdiction in the city of Tombstone. If you did, you couldn't make it stick if you did."" Clanton parades the bodies of his dead through Tombstone and charges that the Earps murdered them. In court, however, Judge Herman Spicer (William Schallert of ""Will Penny"") concludes otherwise based on factual evidence, and the Earps and Holiday are exonerated. Clanton's gunmen, principally Curly Bill Brocius (Jon Voight), Andy Warshaw (Steve Inhat of ""Madigan""), and Stilwell ambush Virgil Earp at night while he is checking doors. Virgil is crippled for life and cannot run for city marshal so Morgan replaces him. Morgan wins the election, but before he can serve, the same three Clanton gunmen blast him in the back with a shotgun while he is playing billiards. Wyatt accuses Clanton's men of homicide but he cannot furnish a witness and the killers go free. Meantime, the honest citizens of Tombstone get Wyatt an appointment as Deputy U.S. Marshal and warrants to serve on those Clanton men alleged to have participated in the shootings of Wyatt's brothers. Wyatt hires Tucson lawman Sherman McMasters (Monte Markham of ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"") to help him out while Doc decides to observe the letter of the law and join Earp's posse. Doc recruits a couple of gunmen, Turkey Creek Johnson (Lonny Chapman of ""Baby Doll"") and Texas Jack Vermillion (William Windom of ""Cattle King"") and they pursue Clanton's killers.

The joy of watching any John Sturges western lies in the choreography. Sturges is one of the few directors who can make the simple act of men crossing a dusty frontier street look like very cool. Mind you, he knows how to block a scene so that everybody is shown moving around for a purpose. Sturges' movies are full of these cinematic maneuvers. Sturges stages all of the shoot-outs with his customary aplomb. ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" differs drastically from ""Hour of the Gun."" ""Gunfight"" qualified as a more bombastic western than the subdued ""Hour of the Gun."" Sturges has eliminated any love interest for Earp in ""Hour of the Gun"" so this biographical western is all about business. The photography, the settings, and the atmospheric help make this western outstanding. Sturges generates suspense with Wyatt Earp's moral decline; his willingness to let his personal feelings overwhelm his judgment. Jerry Goldsmith's evocative music seems inseparable from the gritty action. Jason Robards is both brilliant but ironic as the morally unscrupulous gambler who provides commentary on his friend's moral lapses.

Unfortunately, the MGM-UA DVD lacks anything in the way of a commentary track, but the print of the film looks very good and the sound quality is excellent.",1225497600,6,5388,5.0732807215332585

Interesting to compare this film with the much later TOMBSTONE.  Both are very good, yet still play alittle fast and loose with history.  In reality Earp -- in the aftermath of his brothers being crippled and killed -- only killed four guys: Frank Stillwell the train station in Tuscon, Indian Charlie, Pete Spence and Curly Bill Brocious.  It's never been proven one way or another if Earp or Holliday killed Johnny Ringo.  Garner's Earp is cold and grim.  Robards is a change from Kirk Douglas' version though, personally, I don't think anyone -- even Dennis Quaid who looked  sick & wizened for WYATT EARP -- top Val Kilmer in TOMBSTONE.  Still a worthwhile movie and never a waste of time.  Look for a very young Jon Voight as Brocious, also Frank Converse and the late Sam Melville as the Earp bros Morgan and Virgil.

Following the gunfight at the OK Corral, the three Earp brothers and Holliday are acquitted for the murder of three Clanton gang members.  But in the weeks to come, Wyatt's brother Morgan is murdered and Virgil is crippled by Clanton gunmen.  Wyatt and Doc form a posse and go after the men.  But during the hunt, Wyatt is the one who will stop at nothing for getting revenge for what happened to his brothers, and Doc becomes the voice of reason.  Like a lot of late 1960s westerns, this is not your typical angelic good guys vs. evil bad guys.  All the characters, especially Wyatt Earp, have a dark side that the movie tries to explore, and explores well.  It's more of a character study than an action movie so don't expect a lot of gunfights, but those there are good.  Director John Sturges also directed Gunfight at the OK Corral ten years earlier as well as Hour of the Gun.  Give both a try if for nothing else than to see how different the two films are.

  In a solid performance, James Garner stars as Wyatt Earp.  Garner is cool and calm when he needs to be, but he's also capable of exploding with rage/anger as he tracks down his brother's assassins.  Jason Robards is excellent as Doc Holliday, the dentist turned gunfighter dying of tuberculosis.  But even as he becomes sicker, Holliday sticks by his friend Wyatt Earp.  Garner and Robards work very well together and carry much of the movie.  Robert Ryan plays Ike Clanton differently than you've probably seen in other movies, but Ryan was one of the best and doesn't disappoint here.  His Ike Clanton is equally smooth as he is evil.  Hour of the Gun has a very strong supporting cast overall.  William Windom, Lonny Chapman, and Monte Markham play Texas Jack Vermillion, Turkey Creek Johnson and Sherm McMasters, the other members of Wyatt's posse.  Some other notable names include Albert Salmi, Steve Ihnat, Michael Tolan, Bill Fletcher, Jon Voight, and Robert Phillips.  All in all, an excellent cast led by Garner, Robards and Ryan.

  The Hour of the Gun DVD is not a great one, but it's worth a purchase for fans of the story or the movie.  It offers widescreen and fullscreen presentations and a theatrical trailer.  Not a ton offered here, but it's a strong movie on its own.  Give it a try if you haven't seen it.  Hour of the Gun tries to take a deeper look at a western story that everyone seems to know something about.  Great cast, very good score by Jerry Goldsmith, and beautiful photography from Lucien Ballard.  Check out Hour of the Gun!",1189468800,3,2698,4.558333333333334
500059,4,6302718961,"HOUR OF THE GUN (1967) takes off where director John Sturges' earlier ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" (1957) left off.  The movie opens with Wyatt Earp (James Garner) and Doc Holliday (Jason Robards) trading hot lead with the Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) gang in the Tombstone corral, follows with an extended courtroom scenes in which Earp has to defend himself against charges of wrongful homicide, and concludes with the meat of the movie - the death and serious wounding of Earp's brothers by members of the Clanton gang, and Earp's extended chase of everyone involved.

 Revenge almost always works in westerns, and HOUR OF THE GUN is a revenge western.  Garner, whose greatest assets are warm charm and an embracing smile, has to play it frosty and focused.  The main pull in this movie is constantly brought up by Earp's unlikely friend, the ever loyal Doc Holliday - is Earp an upholder of the law, or someone who uses the law as a means by which he can cold-bloodedly track down and kill the men who murdered and maimed his brothers?  I don't normally judge a movie by its historical accuracy (at least as far as I understand the history,) but HOUR OF THE GUN begs it when it inserts a title card after the opening credits proclaiming `this is how it really happened,' or words to that effect.  The movie gets Earp's post-O.K. Corral vendetta right and his complex relationship with Holliday is believable.  On the other hand, the movie paints Earp as a do-gooder who's driven to the Dark Side by Clanton and his evil machinations - the corral gunfight, even, seems a set-up job by the crafty `Cowboy' (old slang for livestock rustler.)  The biggest historical inaccuracy has to do with Clanton's death - I won't throw a spoiler in here, but the movie's penultimate showdown between its protagonist and antagonist works better as a symbolic, rather than factual, capstone.

 All in all this is a pleasant enough depiction of Earp's vendetta ride against the Clanton gang.  As far as I'm concerned Garner is one of the great under-rated actors of his time, and if he puts a dimmer on his magnetic smile he's makes a convincing Earp - his scenes with Robards, always good, are worth the rental or purchase price.  Robards' Doc Holliday is a plum of a part - dissolute gambler, chronic alcoholic, suffering from late-stage tuberculosis.  Ryan may play a Clanton a little more smooth and calculating than his real-life model, but he's so good in these kind of roles it doesn't matter.  Strong recommendation.",1164499200,2,2508,4.773148148148148

500064,5,6302718961,"I don't know the real history of the gunfight at the OK Corral. I saw the recent movie TOMBSTONE with Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer and found it thoroughly enjoyable but I never considered it to be ""historical"". It was just hysterical.

HOUR OF THE GUN is another, older version of the story. It too is excellent and more believable as a historical drama but I have no conception that it is historical other than the recognition that Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and Ike Clanton were real people; Tombstone, Arizona, Colorado, Mexico and the OK Corral are real places; and a gunfight really did take place at the corral. That doesn't matter to me because this too is a fine film and thoroughly entertaining. It has none of the comic element that TOMBSTONE had but it is a high quality western drama.

This story begins at the famous gunfight and then continues on to examine what happened afterward as Earp and Holliday track down the Clanton gang. James Garner plays the famous marshal and does so without the humor he often brings to the screen. He portrays a relatively silent and brooding figure but he does so well. Jason Robards plays Doc Holliday. His characterization is not as memorable for its outrageousness as Val Kilmer's but it is still well done and the loyalty to a friend comes through strong.

This is a western of a style seldom seen anymore. It is a gem.",1131580800,10,1368,4.598360655737705
500065,5,6302718961,"Hour of the Gun is easily my favorite take on the Wyatt Earp legend, with John Sturges making amends for the strangely rather unsatisfying Gunfight at the O.K. Corral with this dark, revisionist take of the aftermath that seeps with post-Kennedy cynicism. People aren't killed, they're assassinated by riflemen hiding in shadows, trials fail to see justice done, the good townspeople buy off bad guys and the motives for the Clanton-Earp feud are more political and economic than personal (Robert Ryan's Clanton is more of a calculating businessman trying to fend off encroaching Eastern conglomerates and willing to sacrifice his family to do it than the usual crooked pater familias). Throughout, James Garner's Wyatt Earp moves further away from the law as an increasingly cold-blooded desire for vengeance takes over from his principles while Jason Robards bitter Doc Holliday can do little but watch and stand dying by his side.

With a terrific script by Edward Anhalt (who gives himself good cameo as Doc's doc) there's a neat symmetry running through the film - Clanton slinks away from the O.K Corral before the lead starts flying only to find his gang deserting him the same way at the end - enhanced by Sturges' strong visual sense, with locations always sparsely populated or streets often completely empty to emphasise the narrow focus of the conflict. Sturges' usually effortless mastery of Scope frame seems a bit forced in a couple of set-ups where you can see him lining up his actors as if blocking them onstage, but you can forgive him when he throws in an opening sequence that Sam Peckinpah borrowed for The Wild Bunch - the unscripted moment Peckinpah referred to as `the Walk thing' when the Bunch go to their final fate (Peckinpah was a great admirer of Sturges, and as even used Hour's cinematographer Lucien Ballard on Bunch). Throw in a terrific score from Jerry Goldsmith just as he entered his prime, and it's a winner.

The 2.35:1 transfer is mostly good with a little occasional edge-enhancement. The only extra - unless you count  fulscreen version of the film - is the trailer.",1126137600,16,2110,4.938028169014085
500066,4,6302718961,"Many films have been made about legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, many of them focusing on his time in Tombstone, Arizona, and the infamous gunfight at that town's O.K. Corral between him, his brothers, and Doc Holliday on one side and the Clanton and McLowery clans on the other.  In fact, despite plenty of historical inaccuracies, director John Sturges came up with one of the best-known films of that incident, 1957's GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL.  Ten years later, in 1967, he showed us the aftermath of that gunfight in HOUR OF THE GUN.

Whereas the gunfight was the climax of GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, and was placed in the middle later in 1993's TOMBSTONE, HOUR OF THE GUN begins with the gunfight itself, and then goes into the various legal entanglements that followed, as well as the revenge that Wyatt (James Garner) seeks against Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) and his hired help.  Jason Robards, though he was already too old to accurately do the role, does a good turn as Doc Holliday, who becomes Wyatt's moral conscience when it appears that Wyatt has become a vengeance seeker and stopped being a lawman.

As has been pointed out by other reviewers here, HOUR OF THE GUN still doesn't quite stick to all the facts of the gunfight (for one thing, in reality the Cochise County sheriff's name was Behan, not Bryan, as mentioned in the film) or what happened to Ike Clanton (he wasn't killed in Mexico, nor at Wyatt's hand, but in an attempted robbery a few years after the O.K Corral incident).  To add to all that, whereas GUNFIGHT was filmed in Arizona, where the events depicted took place, HOUR OF THE GUN was filmed entirely in Mexico; and even a cursory glance by a viewer can tell it's Mexico, and not the real Arizona.

Still, as advertised, Garner and Robards deliver extremely effective performances, and Robards does deliver some sardonic one-liners courtesy of screenwriter Edward Anhalt.  Although Ike Clanton's role is enlarged in this film beyond accuracy, the benefit is a solid performance of that role by Ryan, whose low-key villainy is matchless.  Jon Voight also appears here (in his first major film) as Curly Bill Brocius.  The flavorful score by Jerry Goldsmith, emphasizing minor keys and some Mexican rhythms, enhances the stature of this rather underrated western.  It makes a perfect companion piece to other Wyatt Earp films in spite of its historical fudgings, and with this great acting on hand it is well worth viewing.",1124496000,7,2458,4.828571428571428
500077,5,6302718961,"I really liked this account of the Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday stories. This is the best out of all the Wyatt Earp movies then Tombstone on my list. James Garner is a legendary actor and it was really good seeing him play a semi-bad character in my opinion, but you can make your own opinion as to whether he's a bad man or is his actions justified. Garner played Wyatt Earp again in the movie Sunset with Bruce Willis. Jason Robards was also very good in his role of Doc Holiday. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is great. We also see a young Jon Voight in one of his first roles. The movie does have some errors though. Wyatt and Doc were about the same age at this time and in the movie Doc seems a lot older than Wyatt. Also, Wyatt Earp did not kill Ike Calnton. But, overall this is a very good movie directed by John Sturges. I highly recommend it for people who enjoy westerns and those who are interested in Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday.",1121385600,7,946,4.2032967032967035
500078,5,6302718961,"I saw this movie when it was released back in 1967 and it has always stayed with me. Whenever TNT would show it on their 4pm western theatre I would catch it, too, having several VHS recordings of it. So when the DVD became available I had to have a copy. My wife and I watched it last evening, she for the first time, and it got a good thumbs up all 'round.

It is far from a perfect picture though, but it is probably the best single production on this subject we will ever get. While I have on DVD 'My Darling Clementine', 'Tombstone', and 'Gunfight At OK Corral' I believe this movie to be better than all of those. 'My Darling Clementine' is a great movie, with black & white adding to the dramatic effect, but it certainly is not anywhere historically correct; while 'Tombstone', a favorite of mine, is in certain scenes filled with too much non-historical baseless humor; and finally 'Gunfight At OK Corral', while excellent, is terribly marred at the end by its being historically incorrect. Johnny Ringo was not killed by Doc at OK Corral, he very well may have been later, but not at OK Corral.

One thing missing in the 'Hour of the Gun' is women; all the other movies of the Earp vs. Clanton/cowboy element involve women on both sides, yet women are totally excluded from 'Hour of the Gun'. To me again that points up the serious historical viewpoint of this movie.  As another reviewer here correctly points out:  though Wyatt did not shoot it out with Ike, Ike was killed a few years later while still stealing cattle. And Ike was never at the brain level of Old Man Clanton, and Ike was never in as much control of events as Robert Ryan portrays.

And Jason Robards is much too old as Doc, since Doc died at the early age of 36 or so. Also in 'The Hour of the Gun' John Ringo is neither mentioned nor does he make an appearance. A strange omission.

Too, the killing of Frank Stillwell in Tucson did not happen as shown here, for he was not killed by Wyatt's handgun, he was pretty much cut in two by shotgun blasts. As a journal entry of the time states ""Frank Stilwell was shot all over, the worst shot-up man that I ever saw. He was found a few hundred yards from the hotel on the railroad tracks."" (source: True West, May, 2005, page 61)

None of the above paragraphs are meant to detract from this movie, because as screen outings go, this is the best of the Earp movies.  And I don't expect a better one during my lifetime.

If you study this episode of the 1880s Tombstone area, this movie helps bring to life what you have read. As far as we know this movie will pretty much substantiate John Sturges' opening claim, ""this is the way it happened.""

And if you would like a look at Wyatt teamed-up with Tom Mix, try watching the movie SUNSET starring James Garner as Wyatt and Bruce Willis as Tom Mix. This Blake Edwards movie is different but interesting.

I highly recommend HOUR OF THE GUN to one and all western fans.",1117756800,25,2943,4.361974405850091
500079,4,6302718961,"I like this film for its somber mood, striking photography and flavorful score by Jerry Goldsmith. It's not the kind of simple-minded Western that John Wayne did to death, and lacks the climatic punch that most of the genre try for, but instead is a demystifying of the folk-hero Wyatt Earp.

I'm a little disappointed with the DVD.  A restoration of the film elements doesn't appear to have been attempted.  The print is clean and has fine color, but the image is a little soft and ""contrasty"" and therefore looks very dated.  A fresh film element from sources as close as possible to the original negatives would have helped.  The sound also has way too much hiss.

This time, James Garner takes over from Lancaster playing Wyatt Earp, while Jason Robards replaces Douglas as Doc Holliday.

Hour of The Gun follows as both of Earp's brother are ambushed after the OK Corral, and shows how a seemingly law-abiding, upright law official can be twisted into a vengeful killing machine. This theme was touched on in the first film, but takes center stage in this film. Robards watches as a man who he admires and respect for his convictions throws them all away to settle a blood feud. Garner's and Robards's performance are outstanding, with first-rate support by Robert Ryan as Ike Clanton, Steve Ihnat as Lattigo, one of the Clanton gang, and a young unknown Jon Voight as Curly Bill Brocious.

In a surprising turn, James Garner turns in a dynamic performance as the stiff-laced Wyatt, who won't rest until justice for the death of his brother has been avenged.
This film serves as a companion piece to THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL (wildly inaccurate in most of its depictions), and it succeeds admirably in attempting to set the record straight.

500084,5,6302718961,"Hour of the Gun is director John Sturges' own revisionist follow-on to his earlier Gunfight At the OK Corral made in 1957 with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas.  Whereas the older film was a traditional stereotypical western which ended with a long, heavily fictionalised re-creation of the famous gunfight this one starts with the gunfight and focuses on its aftermath.  This time Sturges and his screenwriter have made a conscious effort for historical accuracy and the first hour or so of this film is probably about 80% true (Gunfight at the OK Corral was about 80% fiction right down to a climatic fight that included several people, particularly John Ireland's Johnny Ringo, who were never present).  The film was also influenced by a book called The Earp Brothers of Tombstone by Frank Waters, which appeared in 1966 (one year previously) and was the first major work to try and debunk the Earp legend.  More recent historians have discredited Waters for making his book as fictionised as Stuart Lake's Frontier Marshall the tome that set up the Wyatt Earp myth back in 1931.  Hour of the Gun falls between the two camps - it depicts Earp as an embittered, vengeful man but also softens the extent of his revenge killings and creates a greater initial myth about the man's character in order to cut him down to size than he deserved at the time.  For a Hollywood of its time the film is refreshing in its historical accuracy although it distorts the role of Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) who is here the leader of the outlaws and creates an entirely fictional ending in which Earp and Doc Holliday track him down to a hideout in Mexico.  The names of Clanton's henchmen whom Earp hunts down have also been altered and the character played by Steve Inhart who is killed by Earp in a scene taken from Stuart Lake's book was actually called Indian Charlie (but presumably Sturges didn't want to make Earp seem like a racist by shooting an Indian).
The film works very well as a cynical, disenhartened look at a mythical hero (the audience's viewpoint is that of Doc Holliday, played with world weary resignation by Jason Robards, who sees his idol disintergrate but can't bear to leave him).  James Garner as Earp is suitably unsympathetic and far removed from his easy Rockford Files personna.  There is an excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith and you should go out and buy the CD.  Sturges makes splendid use of the widescreen ratio and this film should get a w/s DVD release as soon as possible.

7829910,4,6302718961,"Westerns were still in vogue in the sixties and many classics of the genre were made during this decade. One of the driving forces in the genre was director John Sturges who made films like THE LAW AND JAKE WADE, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL and GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL. Ten years after that last film he returned to the subject matter with this film.

The movie opens with the classic showdown between lawmen Wyatt Earp (James Garner) with Doc Holliday (Jason Robards) and brothers Morgan (Sam Melville) and Virgil (Frank Converse) by his side against the Clanton gang. The film presents a different story than most in that we see a town where some are fearful of Earp and his way of doing things rather than offering full support. Previously films depicting the gunfight always portrayed him as flawless.

What follows is a trial where lies are spoken but the truth comes out as Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) attempts to thwart the efforts of Earp to prevent him from taking over everything. When he offers money to the man that takes out the Earps things begin to go worse for Clanton. With both Virgil and Morgan shot, one dying, Wyatt and Doc recruit a few men to help and set out to track down and either kill or bring back the last members of Clantons gang to face justice. By this time even Clanton has left town for safer spaces.

The movie wraps itself around the discussion of trying to figure out if Earp was a man seeking justice and upholding the law or if hed become a self-proclaimed vigilante by this time. At times he seems to be one or the other but for the most part I found the character to be a little bit of both. With the way things were in the west during this period in history it would be hard to determine how to separate the two.

The movie is an entertaining western that provides plenty of action as well as scenic views of the wide open spaces. Both Garner and Robards take relish in their roles and give them life that some actors might simply walk through. The supporting actors are great as well with Ryan taking to the heel role with ease. Among the other cast members both Monte Markham and William Windom as fellow trackers aiding Wyatt and a then unknown named Jon Voight as one of the bad guys stand out. In the end this is how westerns were back then and it is a treat to watch as a fan of the genre.

Twilight Time offers the movie in a clean and beautiful presentation but with few extras. Sometimes there just aren't many to offer which is understandable. Here we have an isolated music & effect track and the theatrical trailer.

This film starts with that famous gunfight with Earp (Garner) and Holiday (Robards) taking on the Clantons. From there we get a chase/hunting film filled with shootouts & gunfights that I find as gritty and satisfying as the first time I saw this picture as a boy. Garner & Robards are excellent showing the complicated relationship between Earp & Holiday. This is not a ""politically correct"" biography of Wyatt Earp--its much better than that. Earp is a violent, tenacious, law man out to get revenge for the murder & crippling of his Brothers by Ike Clanton and his gang, and by the end of the film its difficult to see how he's any different than the murderers he's been chasing.

7829915,4,6302718961,"Ever since I was a kid watching Hugh OBrien play Wyatt Earp on TV, Ive been fascinated by the character.  By all accounts he would seem to be emblematic of the historical changes coming to America in the 19th Century.  His early life was spent aimlessly trying to find a future.  He spent time with scallywags and prostitutes before turning to lawing as he called it.

This 67 film by John Sturges is a follow-up to his Gunfight at the O.K. Corral from 10 years earlier.  Some call this a sequel but a closer look suggest otherwise.  For one thing all of the actors are different.  James Garner replaces Burt Lancaster as Wyatt, Jason Robards replaces Kirk Douglas as Doc Holliday and Robert Ryan replaces Lyle Bettger as Ike Clanton.  Gone also are all of the women involved in Wyatt and Docs lives in the earlier film.

The historic gunfight itself lasted all of 30 seconds, but in Sturgess 57 version it lasts over 10 minutes with the Earps and Doc wounded and all of Clantons cowboys dead.  In reality only Ikes younger brother and the 2 McLaury brothers were killed.  Ike and the rest of the gang ran away.  Based on my review of history, Sturges gets it mostly right with Hour.  Well, except for the ending, which Ill get to.  Sturges restages the gunfight to open the movie.  The Earps and Doc, deputized by Marshal Virgil (Frank Converse) and special policemen, Morgan (Sam Melville) and Wyatt, are set to disarm the Clanton gang, much to the consternation of the county sheriff, Pete Spence (Michael Tolan) who was in the pocket of Clanton.

After the shootout, the Earps and Doc are brought to trial for murder, but the charges are dismissed.  Clanton and his gunslingers, including Curly Bill Brocius (Jon Voight) want to get rid of the Earps as they are getting in the way of their cattle rustling and other nefarious activities.  After a near fatal attack on Virgil, Morgan is killed in a pool hall.  Wyatt promises revenge and the rest of the film focuses on his vengeful assault on the rest of the gang.

Some critics exalted Garners performance as the mean spirited, highly focused Wyatt.  It may be me, but he just seemed to be TVs Brett Maverick without the smile.  I never bought it.  Robardss Doc gets most of the good lines and surprisingly seems to be the one who tries to restrain Wyatt.  Still the real Doc Holliday was only 34 at the gunfight (dying 2 years later in Denver).  Robards was 57 at the time.  Sturges does a good job with the sets and the photography and the film has an excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.  Some of the events match up well with history, except for Wyatt eventually finding Ike Clanton in Mexico and out-drawing him in a gunfight.  Clanton was actually killed years later by Det. Jonas Brighton in Springerville, Arizona.  The film is a no non-sense accounting and is an entertaining film.",1478217600,,2852,4.603174603174603

7829917,4,6302718961,"The arid, harsh countryside is unappealing and realistic. There are two ways to handle the story: a build-up culminating in the OK corral shootout or beginning with the gunfight and continuing with the aftermath. The second story line was chosen for this film. Thus, after the shootout and the shooting of two Earps, Wyatt Earp and associates go on the extralegal vengeance ride. Earp's murderous ride is only mildly toned down. It should be noted that Wyatt did not shoot Ike Clanton, who in reality was more of a thug than the criminal master mind depicted here. The portrayal of the inquest into the OK corral shooting is reasonably accurate, although, the ""Earp faction"" was never as popular in Tombstone as suggested here. In all, this is an exciting, well acted drama with at least a nod to historical accuracy.",1474416000,,817,4.8428571428571425
