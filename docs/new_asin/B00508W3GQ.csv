I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

Rather scary. Great Movie !!",1491696000,,399,4.72463768115942

8450936,5,B00508W3GQ,"Just caught this flick on TCM. If you love great acting put Kongo (1932) at the top of your list. Walter Huston gets much deserved attention in reviews of Kongo, but Virginia Bruce (just 21 at the time) also shines with what I can only describe as moments of truly modern acting, sometimes almost method-like - a performance which stands the test of time. Conrad Nagel's mannerisms as a drug-addicted physician are equally fun to watch, and Lupe Velez is at her lascivious best.

I would not classify Kongo as a ""horror"" movie (though I'm sure that's how it was sold back then), but instead a ""forgotten horror"" (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forgotten-Horrors-The-Definitive-Edition/dp/1887664203/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forgotten Horrors: The Definitive Edition</a>. The name of the game here, as in many forgotten horrors, is atmosphere. Kongo is steeped in swampy, steamy mist and darkness; I don't think there is one sliver of daylight in this film. If you love classical Hollywood cinema, then between these two elements - the acting and the atmosphere - this film is well worth 90 minutes of your time.",1440460800,2,1161,5.522471910112359

8450939,5,B00508W3GQ,"This movie is absolutely horrible.  If you loved ""Freaks"", you'll like ""Kongo"".  It's rather depraved - no one bathes.  You have to see it to believe that it came out of Hollywood.",1409788800,4,180,4.5625
8450940,4,B00508W3GQ,"it's a very sordid tale. Bought as a horror movie. Not really that type of movie. It's good for what it is, which is sort of a revenge, psychology study of  a man brought low by his need for revenge and the despicable things he does to others in his search for vengeance especially to one young lady. Dialogue stilted at times.",1387238400,2,327,4.274193548387097
8450941,5,B00508W3GQ,"Attention Horror Fans!! Warner Archive has released a rare obscure gem from the early thirties , Director William Cowen's 'KONGO'-1932, an unclassifiable tale of revenge, sadism and jungle thrills boasting awesome performances and incredibly atmospheric images packed into its 86 minute running time.  Basically a remake of Director Tod Browning and star Lon Chaney Sr.'s silent film 'WEST OF ZANZIBAR'-1927, this reboot outshines it by having the main character this time played by Walter Huston taking back stage to the other characters in the film thereby increasing the tragedy and maudlin atmosphere of the jungle surroundings.  Huston plays 'Dead Legs' Flint, a depraved, revenge ridden megalomaniac who lives to fulfill a two decade grudge against Grant played by C. Henry Gordon who was responsible for stealing away his wife and causing his wheel chair bound paralysis.  Ruling his jungle terrain by performing voodoo rituals and magic tricks, he keeps the surrounding cannibalistic native tribes one spear away at every turn.  It would not be fair to continue a synopsis of the film, it should be experienced in all of its humid, torrid glory.  Huston gives a blistering performance right up there with his characters of Old Scratch in Director William Dieterle's classic 'THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER'-1941 and his Oscar winning performance of Howard in his son Director John Huston's masterpiece 'THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE'-1948.  Joining him are actress Lupe Velez as Flint's girl Friday Tula dripping eroticism and sultriness in every frame of the film that she encapsulates; an early performance by actress Virginia Bruce and one of her best roles steering away from the fainting flower hysterics that were embellished by many actresses at that time; and Conrad Nagel who gives his leading man a cutting edge rare for this early sound excursion. The film is beautifully photographed by Harold Rossen actually capturing the heat and humidity of the environment.  Rossen would go on to lens such classics as Director Victor Fleming's 'THE WIZARD OF OZ'-1939 and Director King Vidor's 'DUEL IN THE SUN'- 1946 among others. Rarely screened save for sporadic appearances on Turner Classic Movies,  Warner Archive releases it as a DVD-R with a grainy feel showing that the negative is in need of a digital restoration.  The only extra is a 56 minute documentary entitled 'UNTAMED AFRICA'-1933,  a you-are-there excursion predating the 'MONDO' films which emerged from Italy in the Sixties and centering around the Hubbard family who are showcased by rare jungle footage(not staged) surrounding their safari.  It is inconceivable that a prestigious studio such as MGM would produce a film like 'KONGO' for it resembles its pre-code distant cousin releases from Paramount Pictures: Director Erle C. Kenton's 'ISLAND OF LOST SOULS'-1932 and Director A. Edward Sutherland's 'MURDERS IN THE ZOO'-1933.  Never would MGM ever stoop to such depravity as in this film, even Director W.S. Van Dyke's 'TARZAN, THE APE MAN' and Director Charles Brabin's 'THE MASK OF FU MANCHU' pull in the reins although Director Tod Browning's 'FREAKS' comes awfully close and they were all made the same year -1932.  Rarely seen and never appearing in any film encyclopedias , 'KONGO' deserves a resurrection and hopefully with this important release, it will get the audience it deserves.  The film emerges as a masterpiece from the early sound era and I love every sultry frame of it.",1376006400,14,3476,5.2284172661870505
