436496,5,6302206294,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was my first DVD experience on my home PC and brought cinema to a new level for me.  The video and sound quality were unbelievable.  The only annoying aspect of this DVD is that the user needs  to flip over the DVD during the middle of the movie.  The movie itself was  great!,911692800,,306,4.206896551724138

The movie is really worth watching if you never seen it before, you will not be disappointed. The movie was a huge blockbuster when it released it 1991. It made $390 Million on a Budget of $48 Million with including video rentals, also this was in 1991. The film was a big thing back then. I recommend",1513296000,3,612,4.675925925925926

436794,2,6302206294,"Review of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Alright, Ill come right out and say it: You need to watch Robin Hood: Men in Tights before you watch Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Its the only way youll enjoy it. If you watch Prince of Thieves first, you will hate it. As Cary Elwes mimics in his Mel Brooks spoof, Kevin Costner doesnt even try for a British accent as Robin Hood. Come on, its Robin Hood! I guess Costner figured he was too cool for school and his All-American charm would convincingly coast him through a famously English character. It didn't work.

Maid Marian is utterly unappealing in this version, and during the entire two and a half hour running time, I found myself rooting for Alan Rickmans Sheriff of Nottingham rather than the actual good guy. You will, too, trust me. Robin Hood is boring and far too lengthy, and the only good thing that came out of it was Mel Brookss spoof. Well, thats not fair. There are two very good-looking men in the two leading roles, so at least the girls out there get some eye candy while they're being bored to tears.

You will absolutely howl when you watch Men in Tights; its obvious that while it spoofs other Robin Hood portrayals, this 1991 version was the main inspiration. Literally, theres a hilarious connection during every scene. If you take my advice and watch this movie after its spoof, you won't just howlyoull snort and guffaw, and probably wet your trousers. And thats the only way to go.",1497744000,,1487,4.541044776119403
436795,3,6302206294,I love the movie the two sides is annoying in a way but I still watch it.,1497657600,,73,3.3529411764705883

436887,5,6302206294,"This is perhaps the best Robin Hood film ever made and that is saying a lot.  The combination of the musical score by Michael Kamen and the ensemble cast make this movie a classic.  This is one of the first modern day films that had an overture.

437086,2,6302206294,"How many times do people have to mention this?  Most of us want to see the movie we remember!  It would be nice to see the ""Theatrical Version"" of this movie released on DVD and/or Blu-Ray in full 1080p HD video with either Dolby Digital 5.1 Sound, DTS 5.1 (or 7.1), or TrueHD.  Also, just clean up up the picture until it looks like it once did the day it was released without any color correction, enhancement, or tricks with the contrast, brightness, and darkness.  The technology exists.  It has for a while.  It's not a hard thing for the industry to do!

The ""Extended Cut"" and/or the ""Director's Cut"" can always be included as a separate viewing option.  So many other movies have been released in this manner such as ""Blade Runner"" and the 40th Anniversary Edition of ""The Exorcist"".  When is everyone else going to get on the bandwagon?

I own the ""Theatrical Version"" of this movie on DVD, but you have to eject the disc half way through the movie and turn it over.  It's like watching a laserdisc again!",1471651200,,1014,4.4863387978142075

However, the late Alan Richman is deliciously evil in the movie. And the rest of the cast, especially Morgan Freeman, is admirable.

I was literally shaking my head after each added scene, wondering why it was added back in.  This year marks the 25th anniversary of the film and with Alan Rickman's recent and unfortunate death, I'm hoping they'll release a new commemorative blu-ray that either removes the extended scenes or makes them optional to view.

Love the ending, with Sean Connery as the King...great actor and great choice for a Kingly persona! This is, hands down, the best version of Robin Hood. There is quite a bit of action from the get go, lots of fight scenes, and other action. However, I would suggest parental guidance, as there are some graphic scenes that may not be appropriate for young eyes; along with some sexually suggestive moments and nudity (Kevin Costner's butt, lol). So, parents, if you're looking for an action packed romantic drama; put the kids to bed, or send them off to grandma's, and enjoy Robin Hood.",1459209600,,792,4.506944444444445

437329,5,6302206294,"Caveat: I'm no trendy outre film critic, just another everyday housefrouze. This is my go-to flick when my day has gone from lousy to wretched. As many years as it's been out, you'd think it might be a bit dated, but this is simply not the case -- not with these performances! If you've never seen it, Get It. Besides the acting from Kevin Costner, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Rickman, which is consistently human, real and full of grace, the beautiful score, the lovely scenery, and the creative costuming transport the viewer to the proverbial Another Place/Time. You wouldn't care to live there, but it's a great change of pace from the confines of our own uglyocracy. Sure and it's not Downton Abbey, but then a steady diet of posh British accents can't be good for you -- unless you happen to be a posh Brit.

Inspire is what it does for me, reminding me to be a bit more courageous. The Blue-Ray edition is beautifully clear, the audio acceptable. The only glitch is in the ""Features"" section where pounding down on the button to see first and second cast interviews is futile. Still, within that same section, the lush musical score's best moments are preserved without requiring purchase of another CD. Best part: the producers have added some originally-deleted scenes to the movie to flesh out the story, humanizing a bit more Alan Rickman's villainous character, which I've always thought needed less caricature. It's a great movie -- even has explosions! What more could you want? I even loved the stunt chickens in the trebuchet touchdown scene.",1456876800,,1584,4.845018450184502

Kevin Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio have a sparkling chemistry as Robin and Marian and give us a wonderful love story in addition to the action/adventure.  Kevin Costner is dynamic, yet all to human as the hero of Sherwood, seeking to free his people from the tyranny of the Sheriff, so well-played by Alan Rickman.  Rickman has a grasp for playing the evil tyrant to the hilt, while adding a hint of comedy.  The supporting characters are well-played, especially Morgan Freeman as the Moor who saves Robin.

437679,5,6302206294,"Robin of the Hood, Prince Of Thieves, friend to the poor, on the run from the law. This film has it all. Lots of swashbuckling adventure, heroes, villains, romance, comedy, terrific cinematography ,wonderful actors, great costumes and a truly memorable musical score. It's a great story: Robin Hood(Kevin Costner) escapes from a foreign prison during the 12th century wars, comes home to find his father(Brian Blessed), a nobleman, murdered and the people of his beautiful countryside are starving. The person responsible for all this suffering - well you know - it's the Sheriff of Nottingham(Alan Rickman).

With King Richard also away at the wars, it is up to Robin to save the starving people, thwart the efforts of the Sheriff to take over the country, and save Maid Marion(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) from the clutches of this madman. He has lots of help though; he hides out in Sherwood Forest with Littlejohn, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett(Christian Slater)and the rest of the outlaws, and also is befriended by Azim(Morgan Freeman), a Moor that escaped the prison with Robin.
There's lots of great action and romance to follow. The sword fights, arrows blazing with fire in slo-mo and explosions, all look great in the widescreen, along with the tender moments between Robin and Marion with the great musical score in the background. There's even a surprise cameo(I won't say who just in case you havn't seen it yet).

As I already mentioned there is some great acting in the film. Kevin Costner is a terrific Robin. Alan Rickman is so good at being so loathesome(Die Hard/Quigley Down Under), and Morgan Freeman as usual thrills us with his performance. You'll love hearing Brian Adams' ""I Do It For You"", and the scenery of the English countryside is breathtaking.

I also wanted to mention for those that have not seen it and are thinking about watching it with the family, the PG-13 rating does push the envelope a little. There's some language, and some scenes that may be to sexual(nothing explicit though) for younger viewers. And of course there is all the fighting.

437860,4,6302206294,"Released in 1991, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" stars Kevin Costner in the title role. While some argue that Costner was too humorless and brooding for the part, there are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than that and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative, etc. To be honest with you, Costner was in his prime at the time and towers in the role; whether or not you like him is a matter of opinion. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marian is memorable with her unique facial features and odd hairstyle even though she doesn't trip my trigger. Morgan Freeman as the Moor Azeem is an excellent partner for Robin Hood while Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott are effective villains as the Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisborne respectively. Christian Slater, Nick Brimble and Michael McShane are also on hand as Robin's sometimes merry men, the latter two being Little John and Friar Tuck.

I've always had mixed feelings about this movie due to its mixed tone. As far as medieval films of the British Isles go, I prefer the more serious and consistent tone of 2010's ""Robin Hood,"" 2006's ""Tristan + Isolde"" and 1995's ""First Knight."" While ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is often serious and brutal, it's also sometimes cartoonish and over-the-top. Rickman particularly hams it up, entertaining though he is. Another good example is Geraldine McEwan as the ee-vil witch Mortianna. Her portrayal is spooky and gothic in a comic book horror kind of way, but it detracts from many parts that establish the story as believable quasi-history. Still, she's excellent as the hideous witch. One last example is the semi-goofy or overly epic/heroic action scenes like Robin Hood & Azeem being catapulted over the castle wall. Why sure! Another negative is that the movie's overlong by at least fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining Robin Hood adventure and iconic of early 90's cinema. The entire first act is the best followed by the many Sherwood Forest sequences; and the climatic cameo by a certain famous actor is a great touch. I enjoy seeing it every five years or so.

The film runs 143 minutes and was shot mostly in England, but also France.

437912,3,6302206294,"""Robin Hood: Prince of Thebes"" isn't supposed to be an outright comedy, but thanks to Alan Rickman's over-the-top turn as the dastardly villainous Sheriff of Nottingham, the film's humor becomes its saving grace.  I'm not sure it's what director Kevin Reynolds or star Kevin Costner had in mind, but it's what they got:  plenty of spectacle and a cartload of funny scenes.

Indeed, the filmmakers so broadly characterized this 1991 film with melodramatics and overacting, it made ripe pickings for Mel Brooks two years later with his parody, ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights.""  This is not to say that ""Robin Hood: Prince of Whales"" is a bad film, not by any means, not a Costner disaster of the magnitude of ""Waterworld"" or ""The Postman.""  But it's not the swashbuckling masterpiece they could have made it, either, given the grand old legend the writers had to work with and the stars involved.

Anyway, Warner Brothers had confidence enough in the film to issue it in Blu-ray, with an extra twelve minutes of material added to its already lengthy duration.  At 155 minutes, the movie now seems positively interminable, but for its dedicated fans the additional information should prove worthwhile.  I still don't recognize the new content, though, except to note that the film appears never to end.  If WB had really wanted to do us a favor, they would have clipped it by an hour instead of lengthening it.

The story line of ""Robin Hood: Prince of Peeves"" is familiar to most audiences thanks to countless variations on the theme.  The year is 1194, and England's King Richard the Lion Hearted is away from the country after fighting in the Third Crusade.  In his absence George, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Rickman), has been taxing the people of his county to death in the hope of reaping profits enough to bribe the country's noblemen into helping him usurp control of the government.  What's more, because the Sheriff is not of royal blood, he plans to force himself in wedlock upon the comely (and feisty) Maid Marian Dubois (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), a cousin to the King, thereby enabling him legally to become monarch of the realm.

Meanwhile, in a nod to the sensibilities and political correctness of the late twentieth century, the filmmakers took a few liberties with the rest of the tale.  Robin of Locksley is no mere rich boy who has stayed in his castle during the Crusades but has gone off himself to fight, and when the movie opens we find him escaping a Turkish prison and heading back to his family.  With him is a newly made friend, Azeem (Morgan Freeman), a Moor whom Robin has saved from execution.  Azeem swears to repay the debt and returns with Robin to England.

Upon his arrival home, the first thing Robin finds is that the evil Sheriff has murdered his father (Brian Blessed) and stolen his estate.  From here, the plot follows its familiar course, with Robin joining and eventually leading a band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest, fighting against the Sheriff's tyranny, and protecting the virtue of the fair Marian.

Like so many other films that aren't quite sure of their aim, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Tides"" is a mishmash of disparate elements:  adventure, history, comedy, drama, romance, epic, and legend.  Most of it works only in short spurts, and the whole doesn't hang together very well.  Part of the reason we can attribute to its stars.  Costner is hardly the dashing Robin Hood of Errol Flynn memory.  He's more the sweet, Midwestern, ""Ah, shucks"" type of fellow whose demeanor works perfectly in a film like ""Dances With Wolves"" but who seems lost at sea as one of England's most gallant heroes.  If you're an old-movie buff and have seen the 1938 ""Adventures of Robin Hood,"" think of Gary Cooper in the Flynn role.  Doesn't work, huh?

Because Costner is performing opposite Morgan Freeman, who is never at a loss for forceful, fluent expressiveness, Freeman upstages Costner at every turn.  Again, Freeman is the loyal sidekick, whether it be to Costner, Eastwood, Robbins, Nicholson, or Bale.  He's good at it.  Then, with Rickman playing the heavy in so comically exaggerated a style (""Cancel Christmas!"") that he would not be out of place in Brooks's satire, the three principals seem engaged in entirely different movies.  Figure in an impudent young Englishman, Will Scarlett, played by that noted young Englishman-via-New York Christian Slater, and you get one bizarre set of characters.

Furthermore, there are the script's embroideries, some of which are hardly less than corny.  Nottingham, for instance, keeps an old soothsayer witch, Mortianna (Geraldine McEwan), in the basement of his castle; she's a crone who guides his every move with her fortune-telling charms and spells.  Or take the sequence where Robin returns to England after his long absence and goes to see Marian.  She is wearing, for reasons unknown, full armor and attacks him viciously, apparently not recognizing him and thinking him an intruder.  Surely, she didn't have time to put on a complete suit of armor in the minutes it took Robin to knock on her door and enter.  Besides those peculiarities, there are several contrived, soap-opera turns of events concerning Will Scarlett and Mortianna to contend with, in addition to Michael Kamen's bold but largely overblown musical score underpinning every scene in a grandiose manner, no matter how inconsequential the goings on.  It's all more than a tad much.

It also disappointed me not to find the celebrated archery contest included in the story, the one where Robin splits his opponent's arrow.  But never mind; almost everything and everyone else is here, including the bellicose Little John (Nick Brimble), the jolly Friar Tuck (Michael McShane), the shifty Guy of Gisborne (Michael Wincott), the old family retainer, Duncan (Walter Sparrow), an uncredited cameo visit by Sean Connery, and a whole lot of Costner swinging from the trees and rafters.

Although ""Robin's Hood Is Full of Thieves"" provides more pomp and show than it does characterization, logic, or common sense, it's enough to keep one occupied for most of the film's duration.  It plods along through the first hour but picks up a little more energy in its later stages.  The battle with the Celts is a high point of the action, as is the finale, and the film's location shots in France and England are quite lovely.  If one has the patience, ""Robin Hood: Prints of Thieves"" has its rewards, few as they may be.

Video:
Like its standard-definition counterpart, the picture quality in this 1.85:1 ratio, BD50, VC-1 encoded Blu-ray transfer is curiously soft and murky most of the time, indoors and out.  Since the movie begins in the relative gloom of a dungeon cell, we can understand the dim, shadowy images.  Yet when things open up into broad daylight and objects are still a little fuzzy and veiled, it's rather disappointing.  However, since things are pretty much as I remember them from a movie theater, I'm going to assume the softness is a condition of the original print.  In any case, Warner Brothers' BD transfer captures most of the hues realistically enough, never too bright, though a touch glossy, with a fair amount of detail in some but not all of the close-ups.  You'll notice some oddities in facial colorations, though, which is not particularly good; and a fair amount of natural film grain, which is good.

Audio:
The available audio options in English are Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1.  More important from my perspective, Warner Bros. have finally made TrueHD the default; maybe they've been reading what many others and I have been saying for a long time.  In TrueHD one gets the expected results, only firmer and smoother, with a wide left-to-right stereo spread and a decent, if not spectacular, amount of rear-channel activity.  There is particularly good musical ambience reinforcement in the surrounds, plus the usual variety of bird and forest noises, wind, dripping water, crackling fires, and explosions.  The frequency range and dynamics are only about average for a big-budget movie, though, meaning they are adequate but may not impress one as anything special.

Extras:
This Blu-ray edition contains many but not all of the extras found on WB's two-disc DVD release.  Things begin with the extended, widescreen presentation of the movie, along with two audio commentaries, the first with star Kevin Costner and director Kevin Reynolds and the second with co-stars Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater and co-writers and producers Pen Desham and John Watson.

Next, we get the usual assortment of behind-the-scenes featurettes and movie music.  The bonuses start with a thirty-one minute featurette, ""Robin Hood: The Man, The Myth, The Legend,"" narrated by Pierce Brosnan and made mostly at the time of the film's production as a promotional item.  But it does contain some good bits of information on the origins of the Robin Hood tradition, and it reminds us how much better Brosnan would have been in the starring role.  Then, there are vintage interviews with the film's stars, ""One on One,"" with Costner, Freeman, Mastrantonio, Rickman, and Slater.  Following those, there is a music video, ""Bryan Adams Live at Slane Castle, Ireland,"" the singer performing the movie's closing-credits tune, ""(Everything I Do) I Do For You.""  And a segment I liked a lot was Michael Kamen's soundtrack score that you can play all at once or in separate movements.

In addition, there are a number of TV spots and a widescreen theatrical trailer; a generous forty-six scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian spoken languages; French, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
""Robin Hood: The Movie Formerly Known as Prince"" is not a terrible film, mind you, but it's not the poetic, idyllic, world-beating adventure epic it could have been.  The Wife-O-Meter gave it a 5/10 rating, leaving at the halfway mark, which seems fair enough.

I suspect that too many people involved in the film's creation were going in too many different directions wanting too many different things for them to produce a cohesive result.  Individually, Morgan Freeman stands out, as usual, for his dramatic eloquence; Alan Rickman for his sympathetically amusing villain; and Costner for his down-home, good ol' boy.  Together, however, you take your chances.",1434672000,,10472,5.023740590619571

The writers did a great job and gave Richman some fantastic funny lines and actions. Highest recommendation.",1434153600,,389,4.6521739130434785
437916,5,6302206294,"There have been several adaptations of the Robin Hood legend but Prince of Thieves offers the most. The cinematography in the United Kingdom and France provided greater authenticity of the era than previous works shot in studios, and this was complemented by forest scenes with crunching leaves beneath the feet of actors.

The playful violence of previous versions was replaced with grittier battle scenes, which ensured a realer representation of rebellion against the tyrant Sheriff of Nottingham.

Apart from a notable historical inaccuracy regarding King Richard the Lionheart, and some misplaced foreign accents, the film secured its place as a major box office hit with a full story and a fantastic cast. Also, the film score and the soundtrack song (Everything I Do) I Do It for You by Bryan Adams solidified the movie as an early 90s classic.

The actors in the movie are absolutely amazing, so there wasn't any terrible acting present in the movie whatsoever. If anyone says otherwise regarding the acting abilities of the performers in the film, they're lying.

438131,5,6302206294,"Very good action adventure depiction of the ""Robin Hood"" legend and the medieval Crusades period of merry old England.

  I saw this back in 91 when I was very young and really enjoyed this version or Robin Hood, and still too this very day I have not seen anything top this portrayal of the legendary English hero.  Co-star Morgan Freeman is excellent, playing an African Muslim warrior who Robin runs into & saves during the Crusades in the Holy land.

  Little John is a well portrayed character, Maid Marion is lovely, and Alan Rickman (Die Hard) is also very good as the villainous Sheriff.

 For what ever reason there seems to be a real hatred and dislike of this movie out there among ""Robin Hood"" enthusiasts, and for the life of me I cannot understand why???  Even the late Gene Siskel & late Roger Ebert both hated this movie.  The old Earl Flynn movie was campy, hokey, and totally lame compared to this realistic and darker classic depicting what life was like in Europe in those days.  And Russell Crowe's version of ""Robin Hood""?  Forget it, Crowe's performance was excellent and he is a great actor but the movie around him sucked terribly in comparison to this movie.

 I also did not care if Costner lacked an ""English"" accent, his portrayal was powerful and very believable as the leader of a group of regular people just wanting to live in freedom, turning Sherwood forest into their own ""Camelot"" until the evil Sheriff infiltrates and finds them.

 Costner is Robin of Lockesly, sent as a soldier on King Richard the Lionheart's Crusade in Jerusalem, where he is captured by these ruthless Arabian dungeon masters who torture and kill with ease.  He escapes and frees Morgan Freeman, on a quest to return to his home in England.  But when he returns he finds the country is in trouble, when a corrupt group takes power and abuses the peasantry class.  When his father is brutally murdered and falsely labeled as a ""Devil Worshiper"", he swings into action becoming the outlaw archer of legend stealing from the rich and giving to the poor and innocent.

  This film is filled with very realistic medieval combat action, lots of stunts, romance, and a lot of fine scenery.  I enjoyed this movie very much as a fine action adventure flick very worthy of the name, ""Robin Hood"".  Two thumbs up and A for Costner in ""RH Prince of Thieves"".",1426291200,,2356,4.660194174757281

The exception to this is Alan Rickman  who executes the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham in a manner that is both dastardly and comedic at the same time.

438202,5,6302206294,"I thought Robin Hood Prince of Thieves was a wonderful film.  I liked the dark medieval atmosphere and epic music for the film.  The Overture music in the opening of the movie is one of the best I have ever heard.  I know this film took a lot of heat for not being warm and fluffy like other Robin Hood movies.  But the film is geared towards adults and mature audiences this is not for little kids.  If you want to watch a happy go lucky Robin Hood movie go watch the Disney's ""Robin Hood"" or ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"" with Cary Elwes.

That being said this is one of Kevin Costner's best films.  Kevin had a string of really good films going in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  ""Bull Durham"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""JFK"" before the wheels fell off into mediocrity of the late 90's and early 2000. Kevin does a good job portraying Robin Hood and I liked the fact that you don't get to see that he was spoiled brat of a youth but the film gives you that idea.  When he comes back from the crusades he has a much deeper appreciation for his home and everyone he knew. Kind of a rebellious youth makes good, once becoming a man carrying out justice to those he sees oppressed.  That story has been told before but I liked how the director shot the movie.

The film is much better paced and has a better overall story than the recent Russell Crowe ""Robin Hood"" that came out recently.  That film mainly focused on the origins of Robin Hoods past, which was interesting and should be given credit for originality, but not much else. It was also a darker film but did not have the heart that Prince of Thieves has.

The casting of Prince of Thieves was great on down the line.  I especially loved Allen Rickman's portrayal of sheriff Nottingham.  He has such a great presence as a villain he can't help but admire his acting.  Morgan Freeman was sensational as always and his career really began to take off after this film.  I liked that fact that his character portrayed a smart Muslim journeyman honor bound to repay the debt of life given to him, I thought that really enhanced the story. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio played a very convincing Maid Marion and there did seem to be some chemistry between Kevin Costner and Mary.  The romantic parts were kind of sappy but I thought they worked overall.  The film is long and has an epic feel to it.  If you have not seen it before you don't want to miss any parts because the movie covers a lot of ground.

I feel like this is the best representation of Robin Hood I have ever seen on film.  It may be an adventure ride but it is a fun ride to be on.  Whenever it comes on TV I am always hooked into watching the film no matter what part of the movie is on.  I think that is what really makes a great movie, when you can sit down at any part of the film and enjoy watching the rest of it.

If you like a good story with a lot of action I would recommend Robin Hood Prince of Thieves for sure.",1424390400,,2977,4.226548672566372

438383,4,6302206294,"It's unfair the way this film is overly criticized. Enough about Costner's accent already. He is just the kind of charismatic guy to play Robin Hood in this flight of fancy. Even though it is based on factual evidence, the film comes across as a very entertaining (albeit inferior) re-telling of The Princess Bride. It aspires to higher achievements and though it may not reach them, this is still an enchanting and exciting romp, with even some real pathos.

Some say that Alan Rickman's manic portrayal of the sherrif of Nottingham is the real centerpiece of the film. I'm not sure I agree with that necessarily, but his performance is probably the primary reason that this movie has a ""Princess Bride"" kind of feel to it. As for the added material, I don't think it does a heck of a lot to improve the movie. There is more of Rickman's wackiness, but mainly you get to learn a little more about the politics of the time and how It motivates the characters.

Mostly you just want to root for Robin and his crew. Do so, and you'll be rewarded with rich entertainment that has been very well constructed. This is a successful movie despite Rickman's efforts to turn it into a farce. It has a strain of light danger attributable to Rickman's goofy psychosis but it also has the feel of a light romp that will please fans of that genre. The film does have a more serious side, too, however, in the way it juxtaposes Robin's participation in the crusades and his fight against the oppressive rule the sheriff. If you, as a viewer, want to include that in your experience, you'll probably be rewarded as well. For those looking for a more serious take on the Robin Hood story, I recommend Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. It may be ponderous and otherwise flawed but it is definitely worth a viewing. For a less serious (but wonderful) take, I also recommend the Disney animated version.",1413936000,2,1877,4.6

438441,1,6302206294,"Although sharp the video has clearly gone through some analog phase at Warner Bros (at or after the telecine process) & been subject to cable interference. A nearby power source perhaps?

Horizontal rolling bands are present throughout the entire transfer (looks like the very first DVD player I bought in 1998, connected via S-Video & receiving interference from a nearby desk light). It is most noticeable in dark scenes (1h39m15s is of clear note).

I thought perhaps my TV was playing up (even though the problem is all but impossible with a digital HDMI connection which I'm using). But, after testing on two other display devices & BD players the problem was confirmed.

How did this make it past quality control?

Warner Bros: how about about re-mastering this from the negatives (instead of a late 90's HDCAM analog component transfer which this clearly is)? And while you're at it please give us the original theatrical cut, not some working print otherwise known as an 'Extended Edition'.",1408406400,2,998,4.993975903614458

Even if circumstances were such that the movie schedule didn't allow him to learn his English dialect. His humor, passionate acting skills, and just plain looks make him Robin Hood through and through for me. And combined with the all-star cast; Morgan Freeman, Alan Richtman, not to mention the cameo by a legendary actor, and of course everyone else combines to make this movie work!

The beautiful scenery, costumes, that's a whole other story.

It worked at the box office, and it works today! In my humble opinion.

And I  really enjoyed all the extras, behind the scenes, etc., as well. Oh, and the cast commentary brings it to a new level, too.

Bottom line, love it! Feel-good movie, with action, adventure, humor, romance and imagination. Not to mention the deeper messages laced throughout.",1407196800,,958,4.781818181818182

Its one of the cheesiest things I've ever seen. In my personal opinion, if not for cast members like Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman, not to mention some of the British cast members most American viewers had never seen before or since, the whole thing would've been a flop.

Someone thought that Maid Marion should be a modern woman and that a black character was needed to show, by his good moral character and wise sayings, just how dumb Robin Hood is.  BAD ideas.

438676,2,6302206294,"The extended version features a lot of additional scenes of Alan Rickman (Sherriff of Nottingham) dancing around like a babling fool trying to come up with a plot to take over England. In the original version he still was trying to take over, but he was edited in a way to make him look really dark and sinister. With the cut scenes put back in he looks like an idiot and he's not even remotely a scary villian.

This is no fault of Alan Rickman. The scenes just stunk. It's more of a credit to the original editor who cut those scenes and left only Rickman's very well done scenes in the original film. In that version Rickman's character is a super scary Sheriff of Nottingham who is not to be triffled with. In this version it is more like the Sherriff of Rottingham from Robin Hood Men In Tights.

Great job, first editor. You stink, second editor.

The changes really alter the flow of the film by making the Sherriff comic relief. It ended up being more like the Disney version of Robin Hood with the incompetent goofball sheriff.

On the plus side the high definition print looks fantastic. This film was beautifully shot with elaborate set designs and vivid Earth tones as the color look. That all pops brilliantly on the DVD. The audio is fantastic as well, as this film includes a great audio score.

438711,3,6302206294,"This movie contains every Hollywood cliche' you could imagine!  First of all, some of the dialogue and acting were shallow and poorly scripted.  Second, I'm sick of watching movies that portray Westerners as backwater hicks and everyone else in the world as enlightened!  Move ahead a little in history and you have the inventions of calculus, physics, chemistry, etc., all thanks to the West!!!  Thirdly, the villain is being portrayed as a Satanist rather than a Pagan, which would have made him the outlaw during the middle ages and not Robin Hood!  Such things were completely shunned, although they did happen back then in the shadows and still do happen in pockets of Europe.

The movie is OK only because it paces the story along fairly well.  After seeing Robin Hood: Men in Tights on TV and the music video with Bryan Adams, I just had to find out about this one.  I hated the parody mainly cuz I can't stand Cary Elwes - he's a douche bag in case you didn't know.

In summary, it's OK if you like sappy Hollywood garbage and like it wrapped a Hallmark Card, cuz that's all this Piece of S*** has to offer.  Typically, Morgan Freeman plays somewhat of a wise old man offering wisdom, but his character falls flat.  That goes for all the characters in this.  There's more charm in a turd than in this, well...., turd.",1383350400,,1325,4.567796610169491

Half the movie is on one side of the disc, then you eject it, turn it over, and watch the other half of the movie. As poorly as the video quality is, surely they could have put it all on one side of the DVD...

This Blu-Ray isn't much of an improvement from the 2-disc special extended edition DVD. The additional 12 minutes of footage extended after the theatrical release remains incorporated into the film. It offers great audio but only average picture quality. It was a 5 star DVD release but without a good remastering and new supplements it seems light now (there is roughly 1 hour of bonus content and 2 audio commentaries). Some fans don't like the deleted scenes inserted into the main feature but if you haven't seen the extended edition yet it is worth a look. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe share some dialogue and delivery problems in the lead role (in completely different versions of Robin Hood) but Costner's charm helps in this edition. The music, score and performances are otherwise excellent.

Special Features:
12 Added Never-Before-Available Minutes of Footage Incorporated Into The Film (12 Min)
Network making-of documentary ""Robin Hood: The Myth, The Man, The Movie"" (1991; 32 Min) hosted by Pierce Brosnan

Score-only audio track with all-new Dolby Digital 5.1 Remix
""Weapons of the Time"" 3-D gallery

438754,4,6302206294,"If I had to come up with a list of some of the best action movies I had ever seen then certainly ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"" would be somewhere on that list. Almost throughout the movie from beginning to end the action is almost non-stop with a little comedy and some romance here and there to help keep the movie interesting. Kevin Costner is the star of the film and ""Robin Hood"" rates as one of his finest performances. For some reason a lot of people who want to complain about this movie like to pick on the accent, or I guess I should say the lack of an English accent, being spoken by Costner. Really?!?! With all that non-stop action taking place on the screen with fights and flaming arrows flying and battle scenes you have time to notice how Kevin Costner is speaking in the movie? Ok I will give you that the movie takes place in England and all but I really don't think the entertainment in this film is lessen by Kevin Costner not speaking with an accent. I find despite the lack of the accent Costner really gets into the roll and I find him quite believable as Robin Hood. Certainly I would rate Costner's performance as one of the best if not the best Robin Hood ever to appear on the silver screen.

However to me the real star of this movie is Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Rickman plays a delightfully evil Sheriff and provides the definite portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham. What makes the performance so good is the enjoyment that Rickman gets from playing such a dastardly character. A lot of actors like to play the bad guy in a movie because the bad guy usually has the best and most interesting roll in the movie. With Rickman that is certainly the case here. There have been other actors to play the part of the Sheriff of Nottingham in other versions of Robin Hood up on the screen but none took over the roll and made it his like Rickman did in ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"". His portrayal is so good that I can't think of Alan Rickman without thinking of the Sheriff of Nottingham and visa versa.

All in all this is I think one great action movie that you will enjoy if you like that genre of movie. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and I promise you will get so caught up in the story line of the film you will very quickly forget the absence of any accent on Kevin's part. I would recommend this anyone to watch.",1377043200,,2378,4.282222222222222

I love the way they got the medieval theme perfect, the nature is absolutely beautiful and the people they cast couldn't have been better. They should have seriously stopped with creating any more versions of Robin Hood. They got it perfect with this version. I especially love the extended version because it shows more scenes that make the movie that much more better.
Overall, this is the best movie ever.
One thing I wish they would have kept on this copy is the Original Bryan Adams video of Everything I Do, I Do It For You, where he's in the forest with a piano, singing and clips of the movie are going perfectly with the song.",1365292800,,693,4.464566929133858

The movie cuts off halfway through, and you have to flip the disc over to see the 2nd half.  There's no menu on the 2nd side, which leads me to believe this might not even be an official transfer.  No quality copy shuts off halfway through a conversation.  The cases are all stamped ""disc made in Mexico"" in small blue print on the plastic.  I didn't get around to watching it until it was too late to return it, otherwise I'd be clamoring for my $5 back.  If you like this movie, don't go for the cheapo copy of it.

If you're looking for more of the movie, please don't bother with this dvd.  The few scenes that were added should (and was) cut from the theatrical version.  Not only that, but the description on the dvd should have read that this was the full screen version (if you're thinking it's blue ray so it should automatically be the widescreen version you'd be mistaken).  I loved the original movie a lot and was looking forward to a bit more of it. Unfortunately, this version was below expectations.

So why did I buy this movie? I bought it because I love the story, and I bought it because the rest of the cast was superb.  From Little John to Maid Marian to Friar Tuck - they were all perfect.  I'm a huge fan of both Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman, and they were both brilliant, so much so that I am able to tolerate Kevin Costner as he muddles through an otherwise perfect movie.",1361145600,,603,4.076271186440678

Also, the volume between the speaking parts and the musical score have been leveled quite sufficiently!  Take the ""extended"" scenes for what they are, they do add some context to a few scenes that were a bit of a mystery to me in the theatrical version.  The relationship between Mortiana and the Sherriff is FAR more clear.  A few of the other extended scenes showed why they were cut though.  All-in-all I'm very happy with it.

That said, the DVD is a low res 480p and therefore grainy when played on a digital TV, but still quite watchable (unlike a VHS tape which isn't worth watching on a digital TV). The extended version is delightful in the additional footage and includes a surprising critical revelation of relationships that was unknown previously. There is much more to watch of Alan Rickman in his delicious portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham. This story version of the classic tale is ever a delight, no matter how many times one sees it. The special features with the ""vintage"" cast interviews are nothing special as they are more or less without energy or enthusiasm and conducted as promotional appearances with typical 'silly' reporter questions. No revelations here and once you have seen them you won't likely be tempted to watch again.

When you click on it, you get redirected to the 1997 DVD release version.  Now I am a fan of the movie so this not a review of the movie rather the overall product.  Nowhere does it say that this movie is a split DVD ie during the movie you will play it on one side for half of the movie and then you need to flip it over to get the rest of the movie.  So overall DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.  Buy the special 2 disc Edition or if you want to get blu ray do that.  However, my personal opinion about blu-ray movies that were not originally shot in blu-ray quality cameras will never match the quality of blu-ray material.  Save your money and stay cheap on older movies with standard dvds.  So hopefully you read this and save yourself the frustration of finding out that this particular DVD is not what you will want in your collection.

I received my copy of the extended edition on Blu-ray, today. I played it right away.  The whole movie was there. No problems whatsoever.  The sound and picture quality were excellent, with no glitches at all.  The entire movie was on one side of the disc, which I was very pleased with. The first copy I bought back when it first came out on regular DVD, was a two-sided disc, which I had no problem with flipping it to watch the rest.  Although,I am glad I no longer have to deal with that anymore.  The additional scenes gave the movie a more dark side to it.  The only scene that should have been left out, was when the sheriff cut out the Scribe's tongue.  Later on in the movie, the Scribe had to write on a chalkboard in order to talk. However, when the Moor and Robin Hood stormed the palace, Robin asked the Scribe where Lady Marian was, he was able to tell him where she was.  Generally, a person can't talk without a tongue.  Apparently, the editors didn't think about that particular detail.  I am willing to overlook that technicality, because overall, this is an excellent movie. :)",1356912000,,1218,4.441441441441442

439158,5,6302206294,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" starring Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Neat movie. I enjoyed it very much. Well, who doesn't know the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men living in Sherwood Forest and robbing the rich and giving the proceeds to the poor. It's a classic. I guess I first read it in grade school and who knows how many different versions I've seen on TV and in the movies. That's okay, for a movie like this I just sit back, relax and enjoy. Most of the actors, except for the bad guys, look like they're having a really good time. The movie is even funny in places, but it never drifts into being a comedy. The horses are magnificent. The low-tech battle scenes are spectacularly done using high-tech techniques. The settings are superb. There's lots of action. death and destruction. The costumes of the robbers are so grubby that they look like they would smell bad if you got close enough to them. And, the leading lady remarked to Robin Hood that he might bathe more often. It was a funny remark that fit.

The movie was very well done. Surely it got a bunch of awards. The DVD really surprised me in splitting the movie into two halves, one on each side. And my transition through this unusual operation was rather awkward. No big deal, though. It's a good movie and Kevin Costner makes a very likable robber.

439208,3,6302206294,"I found an old VHS tape in a donation box on a sidewalk and found the Robin Hood Prince of Thieves within.  Perhaps I should have left it there!

Panned at the time of its 1991 release, American-sounding Kevin Costner's emotional range is not all that great.  He escapes from a Moslem prison, a participant in the Crusades, run by King Richard (whom we don't see until the end, quick cameo by Sean Connery).  This aspect was pretty good - friend dies in sacrifice, great photography and intensity of story.

Morgan Freeman stands out as the Moslem who has a life debt with Robin and so he comes to England with his ""Christian"" friend.

The story of Robin Hood is quite compelling, gives to the poor by robbing the rich, but Costner seems to be phoning in his lines and has none of the swashbuckling, adventuresome self-confidence of Errol Flynn's 1938 ""Adventures of Robin Hood.""

Alan Rickman chews the scenery with his campy over-acting.  Hard to believe this was the same actor who played it straight in ""Die Hard"" or evoked evil imagery in the Harry Potter films.  The occasional 20th century phraseology (""bring a friend"") was pretty bad.

Alan could have played it better as John.  His relationship with the old crone was unclear.  His thirst for women and relentless killing was a bit much - no one would oppose this type of tyranny?  Hard to swallow.

Despite these problems, some scenes stand out - the invasion of the Celt-like band as they invade the forest and burn out Robin (these crazed warriors had really bad make-up!) and the rescue of Little John's family did elicit interest and was played seriously.

Bottom Line:  The serious parts play well.  The attempts at comedy, not so much.  Rickman's campy acting ruined it for me, as well as Costner's lack of real emotion.  Decent photography and scenery as well as its famous theme-song (Bryan Adams', Everything I Do, I Do For You, was quite well-done. ) helped it along - worth a watch but not more than once!",1341187200,,1977,4.661849710982659

439213,2,6302206294,"When I was but a wee lad (six, actually) this film was released.  I actually didn't see it till I was a bit older, but in my young adolescence, pre-teen years, this was a favorite of mine.  I've always had a thing for the story of Robin Hood and its many variations.  It's a valiant story with such available depth and it really does run the gamut of checkmarks to make a great adventure film.

Having sat down recently for a rewatching, something I haven't done in years, I was prepared to completely fall in love all over again.  In my head I was about to see something grand and epic and, well, wonderful.  Sadly, my recollection of this film is far grander than what I was actually presented with and I began to question my hazy memory.  Did I really love this film so much in my youth?  I've tried to make it a point to revisit some of my fonder cinematic memories of my childhood, and mostly I've remained happy with them.  In fact, with some films (`The Neverending Story' for instance) I walked away even more enamored by a recent viewing.  In this case, I was left somewhat stumped by my initial adoration of the film.

`Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' is just not that good.

First of all, I have grown to hate Kevin Costner.  In my youth I didn't know any better.  I didn't really care about acting until I was in my early teens.  But, in my adulthood I have found Kevin Costner to be one of those actors who does NOTHING for me.  He's barely a notch above Keanu Reeves in my book, for the man is so wooden and can't emote for anything (but I will admit that he was pretty effective in `Dances With Wolves' and downright Oscar worthy in `The Upside of Anger').  I just find him so dull.  Here, he is basically a prop.  He doesn't serve any real justice to the character, doesn't layer him with any true development, and that accent is horrific.  The biggest problem with this film though, is that it basically takes on the persona of its star.  The film is boring.  It just drags out and doesn't infuse itself with anything arresting, outside of Alan Rickman who is borderline ham but the kind of ham I want to lather with honey and devour (and no, that is not a sexual reference but more a figurative way of saying that I totally dug what he did with the character despite the fact that it was completely out of tone with the actual film).

The theme song is beautifully remembered, albeit completely sappy and not right for this film, and the technical achievements (sets, costumes, makeup, action sequences) are actually pretty great, but overall I found the film surprisingly sleep inducing, ridiculously unauthentic (like, at least try to make this seem logical or historical) and the acting outside of Rickman was just a total waste.

Just a little suggestion; try watching the Scott/Crowe collaboration for a more engrossed retelling of the story.  It isn't perfect, but it is leagues above this mess.",1339113600,,2918,4.49146110056926
439224,5,6302206294,"So, yeah, the movie is good.  Kevin Costner nails the spirit of the Robin Hood character, if not the accent (but enough has been said about that already). Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman make the movie, of course. Every generation seems to have its own preferred version of Robin Hood, from Errol Flynn in the '30s and '40s, to the TV version of the '50s and '60s, even to the Disney animated version of the '70s (and I'm sure the next generation will probably hold some regard for the Russell Crowe version); as someone who was around 8 or 9 when ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" debuted theatrically, this is my personal favorite.  Everything--from the sumptuous set design and costumes, to the unique character actors, to the refreshingly earthy romance between Robin and Marian, to the slightly darker take on the legend--just plain works.

Picture quality on the Blu Ray is about average for a twenty-year-old catalog release; not bad, but not exactly the best Blu has to offer, either. The film could definitely use a new HD master, but public demand is most likely not large enough to justify the costs in Warner Bros.' view, so this'll have to do.  Sound quality is excellent: the film's soundtrack was recorded using a Dolby process which was experimental at the time. It was rendered on the previous two-disc special edition as DTS, and appears here on Blu Ray as a Dolby TrueHD track.  Special features are adequate, but are definitely showing their age at this point: two documentaries are presented, one of which is hosted by a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan decked out in some very '90s attire.

And now comes the vitriol:

1) I really wish they would include the superior theatrical version in whatever ends up being the next release. The extended version of this film completely throws the pacing off and ultimately robs its most interesting character, Nottingham, of some of his compelling, unexplained weirdness. Normally, I'd be of the opinion that ""more Alan Rickman = better"" in a film; however, revealing the Sheriff's backstory doesn't add much to the character or the film overall.  Unfortunately, consumers who prefer the theatrical cut only have the option of purchasing the original non-anamorphic two-sided DVD, one of the earliest (and worst) releases from Warner Bros. on DVD.  Which brings me to:

2) I've noticed this issue for years but haven't addressed it until now.  Saying this will probably bring unhelpful votes my way, but I can't figure out what is wrong with some of these reviewers here.  Is it head trauma?  Some kind of cognitive disorder?  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, because it can't be that they're too stupid to navigate a 15-year-old technology.  (And I'm not leaving aside any senior citizens on this, either; if you can figure out how to post a review on the internet, you can figure out how to flip a damn DVD.)  These folks have dragged the rating of a good film down because they've been outsmarted by a piece of plastic which, by the way, clearly states that the ""additional content""--i.e., the second half of the movie--is on the reverse side of the disc. I know this because A) I own this version of the movie, B) I can read, and C) I'm not a moron.  This phenomenon has also affected the ratings of otherwise films that were originally released on ""flippers"", like Goodfellas or Sleepers, for example.  Now obviously, Amazon bears some responsibility on this issue because much of their movie ratings are aggregated from several different releases of the same film.  But what's REALLY hilarious is that flippers have been around since the very earliest days of DVD, and 15 years later I'm still seeing reviews basically saying, ""derp, I am outraged, this only has half the movie on it, whatever shall I do, derp derp !!""  Please stop.",1338422400,12,3804,4.814132104454685
439225,5,6302206294,"Kevin Costner plays Robin of Locksley, Morgan Freeman plays his Moorish friend Azem, Alan Rickman is very Snape-like as the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Sean Connery makes a cameo appearance as Richard the Lion-Hearted. Marian is both beautiful and brave and played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (someone I'd never heard of before). I have to say this is the best version of Robin Hood I have ever seen.

Of course, many people have told this tale over the years, and added or subtracted elements as they chose. But the bulk of the story as I remember from my childhood is here. Little John and Friar Tuck, and the merry men. Adding the Moor was easy: Robin saved his life during the crusades, and so he followed Robin until he could pay back the debt. Actually, I only know about four versions of the story, and one of those was Disney done with animated animals, so I can't be sure whether any given element is original with this particular film.

Scenes are lavish, the costumes are amazing, the stunts wonderful, the action bold and yet possible to follow (mostly), the characters flesh and blood people (except perhaps for Nottingham's witch), a lot of amusement along with the serious story, what more could anyone want?

Morgan Freeman plays a roll as Robin's guardian angel, not Freeman's usual repertoire but he excells, Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio brings most to the movie as Marion, but both Robin, Marion and the Children they eventially set forward to protect as they strive to survive and keep a rightfull king on his throne would be little to nothing without Nottingham's lenendary sherrif, who lives on in infamy. Alan Rickman, later Harry Potter's Snape, brings the role to life with what can only be looked at as toungue in cheek devilry. He seems at his most effective when threatening to wield a spoon.

The storyboard is well written, the dialogues excellent, the backdrops and sets are the only area the movie fails in, and that's infrequent. If one knows the areas it was filmed you can see how camera angles were not always successfull in keeping the fact ""castles"" and ""manors"" were ruins, but its a minor issue.

The scenery and special effects are otherwise excellent, even after a decade they show little age.

There isn't really anything in the movie I'd say was inappropriate for kids, and as inexpensive as it now is it might be a shame not to own it.",1330041600,,1498,4.786821705426356

439257,4,6302206294,"Great enjoyable film, just be careful which disk you order.

I bought this film on DVD a year ago through an Amazon third party, for around $5.99.  As noted by others here, half the movie was missing, and there was no title sticker at the top of the case, which sometimes means you have a bootleg copy or a repackaged disk.  The good news: Amazon stood behind the product and gave me a full refund.

I ordered it again this month, almost 12 months later, but this time offered directly from Amazon, and received yet another disk that had only half the movie: it stops at the beginning of Scene 17 and even the index shows this.  Called Amazon, they apologized and are sending another copy to me overnight.  I hold out hope that I get a real full copy this time.  My advice: read these reviews and order the two set DVD that everyone is raving about.  It seems to be the real deal.

All logistics aside, this is a fun and entertaining movie that features a hilarious over the top performance by the fabulous (pre-Harry Potter) Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Costner is good in the title role and the chemistry between him and Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (as Maid Marion)seems genuine, and you have the pure delight of Morgan Freeman's magnificent presence. And as a (small) bonus,a semi-decent, scowling performance from Christian Slater.

Blasphemy I know but I like this film much better than the iconic 1938 Errol Flynn Robin Hood.  This film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, has a cohesive storyline, and characters, you actually care about.

What bothers me is this blu ray includes the extended version only. The extended version of a movie is not always the best as demonstrated by this blu-ray. I'll explain why. In this extended version the scribe character gets his tongue cut out. Later on in the extended cut you see him using chalk and slate to write messages to the sheriff rather than talking (cause he has no tongue you know.)  But later in the movie in a scene that was in both versions of the film he is talking as if he still had a tongue when Robin asks him where Marian is.  Maybe I'm getting nit-picky but it just really bothers me that they not only would not attempt to fix such a blatant error but also make this the only version available.  Its like the Director could care less.

439302,4,6302206294,"I adore medieval history and own a number of movies set in this time period. I have a special love for the Robin Hood story. I own every movie version as well as several TV versions including the full set of the BBC ""pagan"" series. The Costner version is definitely a ""Hollywood"" version, with a focus on the humor. That being said, and I enjoy it a lot.

In Prince of Thieves, we have a deliberately multi-color version of the story, and I don't mind that at all. I enjoy the new twist on things. Morgan Freeman joins in as the ""wiser"" infidel who introduces the backwards English to the wonders of telescopes. In the beginning Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, playing Marian, is a kick-butt independent woman. By the end she's shrieking for help and Robin has to save the day. Alan Rickman, the Sheriff, is absolutely brilliant with some fantastic lines.

Is it entirely authentic? No, and again, that's fine. It's a modern retelling for a modern audience, bringing the important meaning to life in a new way. It's like retelling Romeo and Juliet in the streets of New York City. We get heroes that more of the audience can relate to, and villains we can all root against. Geraldine McEwan's witch character is delightful, and a perfect foil for the Sheriff.

If I have complaints, they're not about the Costner accent, which I understand was scrapped due to their frantic pace to get out before the Bergen version did. I adore the Bergen / Thurman version, so there was definitely a stiff competitor being presented there. Instead, my complaints are more with Costner's acting. There are several scenes where he attempts to give a sense of ""realism"" by running or jumping - and he ends up panting like he's about to collapse and barely able to get his lines out. That doesn't give me the sense that he's the athletic Robin Hood - just that he's a not-in-great-shape actor. I wish he would have just cut the scene so he could do the running, recover, and then do the speaking. His desire to be ""in the moment"" inflicts more issues than it could possibly solve.

They're a mite heavy handed about the whole ""infidels are brilliant"" angle. I realize that people from the Middle East were denigrated for centuries and deserve a fair shake, but Costner went a bit overboard.

It always bugs me that Marian has such a strong, powerful start, and then falls fairly quickly in the ""I need a man to help me"" role that women so often get stuck into in movies.

Still, this all balances against some scenes that are simply priceless. The spiraling of the couple down from their treetop town. The Sheriff scrubbing away at the scar painted on his statue. The spoon! There are so many little touches here that are pure delight.

Well recommended - just treat it as a fun take on the Robin Hood legend, and don't get too obsessed about medieval accuracy.",1322265600,,2839,4.6099009900990096

439376,2,6302206294,"I had very fond memories of this movie as an early teen, and truly for the time it was made, it was a decent piece of entertainment. This movie, unfortunately, hasn't aged very well. I find, as an adult, that I have a much harder time getting past Kevin Costner's wooden acting, possibly because since this movie we've had the ""opportunity"" to see Kevin Costner fill more roles he is similarly ill suited for.

However, the Prince of Thieves film is still entertaining, worth owning if you can find it at a decent price. It was a milestone in creating historical films that looked more ""lived in"" and reasonably authentic to what we'd seen previously, and PoT has a solid cast overall.

I can't, however, recommend this extended version. Director's cuts and extended editions tend to not work out too well, generally speaking. They're generally cut a certain way for a reason and watching it cut differently, even if the scenes are passable, can ruin the pacing or atmosphere of a particular piece. (Ridely Scott films tend to be the exception as I have yet to see any of his director's cuts that were not a stark improvement over the original, including, by the way, his rendition of the Robin Hood story.)

The extended scenes do very little to add to the film, and in fact, make it feel even cheesier than it did previously. The scene in particular where the Sherrif (along with his new Celtic ally) has a confrontation of sorts with the barons certainly did not need to be in any cut of the film. This is the sort of garbage that belongs in the special features under deleted scenes not cut back into the film. This would be forgiveable if it were possible to watch the original cut of the film, but you do not get this option.

As far as I know, at this time, this is the only bluray edition of the film, but frankly, as the bluray doesn't look any better than a upscaled DVD, you're really better off getting the DVD of the original version of this film. I got this for $5, and frankly, I got robbed. I'd rather not own the movie at all then to have this garbage extended edition. Yes, it's that bad.

 When I bought this version of Robin Hood- Prince of Thieves, I first thought that I was only getting special bonus material, not realising that they added scenes to the movie. I would have accepted the extra scenes, maybe even been pleasantly surprised by them, has they added anything to the movie. Instead, I found that sometimes, those who edit the film for theaters know better than those who direct them.

 The film, in its theatrical version, is not perfect, but it is not weighed down by odd, and sometimes contrary bits of story. The extended version made both the characters of Azeem and Friar Tuck seem rather perverted, and the character of the Sheriff of Nottingham seem more whiny than menacing. They also added a small bit where one minor character's tongue is cut out, then they have him speaking in the very last part of the movie. The only addition at truely added to the story is the one of the witch telling the Sheriff of his birth, and even that seemed to bog the the movie down.

439420,2,6302206294,"Where to begin?  Hmm, the positive, as there's so little: there are some amusing action sequences and one-liners.  Sean Connery.  Marian's servant. And... not too much else.
  Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner and talks in the most monotone voice that you just are begging for him to die already.  (It's not good when you're cheering for Robin Hood to die.)  He has a completely unnecessary (and supposedly body-doubled) nude scene which makes the romance between him and Marian that much more unappealing.
  Maid Marian almost deserves Kevin, though.  Her character is horribly uneven.  Why does she give up all Ninja skills when she meets Robin Hood?  They should have had someone (the priest, the witch, the sheriff) knock her out to spare us her uselessness in the last fight.
  Speaking of uselessness: Azeem- a pointless character.  I like Morgan Freeman, but his character was written with an agenda, to show the Christians are infidels and he is godly.  I get the point, but it was very heavy-handed (and one-sided) and out of place in this movie.  How many times does he have to say that he doesn't drink?  Did we really need the rivalry between him and the friar?  No.  Did we need him at all?  No- because the witch, who gives him purpose (as he has to kill her) is unnecessary.  On a side-note, why does he have to kill the witch twice?  How does she suddenly appear (un-stabbed) in the room?  How is Azeem magically healed at the wedding?  But let's not get bogged down with these trivialities.
The script suffers from so many convolutions and complications, none of which add anything to the story.  How many Darth Vaderesque scenes are we supposed to endure?  ""George, I am your mother!"" ""NOOOOOOOO!""  ""Robin, I am your half-brother!"" ""I have a brother."" <--Actual line, delivered in that same monotone voice; I had to laugh and cringe.  Yes, you have a brother, but it's Christian Slater, sorry!
Alan Rickman's sheriff is so over-the-top and adds yet another tone to this cacophony.  The directors (there must have been more than one, right?) have conflicting ideas about what this movie's supposed to be and where it's going.  It ends up being Braveheart (but without the brave and without the heart) and going nowhere.  [Just tell me Kevin Costner doesn't look like William Wallace in this movie.  Especially when he's giving all these speeches about freedom.]

-Buy The Adventures of Robin Hood (Errol Flynn).

439426,5,6302206294,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

I don't know why ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" so often gets a cold shoulder from critics.  Kevin Costner does not really attempt an English accent, and the movie dares to be grittier than the somewhat sanitized famous Errol Flynn starrer ""The Adventures of Robin Hood.""  Yet, this movie, also starring Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth MasterAntonio, remains a modern classic.

A sharp screenplay highlights a unique telling of the English legend.  Mr. Costner's Robin of Locksley is a soldier in the Crusades under the leadership of Richard the Lionheart.  Upon arriving home in England, he discovers a ghoulish, heartbreaking murder and together with his traveling companion Azeem(a brilliant Morgan Freeman) he determines to avenge his father's death.  A nasty and cold yet darkly humorous Alan Rickman is the Sheriff of Nottingham and is priceless in the role.  Mary Elizabeth MasterAntonio is perfect as Maid Marian.

Also featuring Christian Slater, Sean Connery, and Nick Brimble as an expertly realized John Little ('Little John') ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" remains greatly entertaining.",1298937600,,1135,5.44
439427,1,6302206294,"This DVD does indeed include new scenes, as the description says.  And these scenes are indeed incorporated into the film.  My MAJOR problem is that there is no way to turn this feature off.  There is no way to view the movie as it originally presented when I saw it as a kid.  I don't mind having new scenes incorporated into films, but the option should be just that: an option.  There should be a way to view both the 'new version' and the old.  Most films now have a 'directors cut' option for viewing and will allow to view choose between it or the original theatrical release.  The newest Robin Hood with Russell Crowe springs to mind as an example, as does James Cameron's 'The Abyss' which includes quite a bit of extra footage.

It really is a shame that on both releases of this film to DVD the big wigs just couldn't seem to get it together and give fans the DVDs they deserved.  On both DVD releases there are issues with sound and picture quality.  The major gripe with the first release is that it is a 'flipper', which means it must be flipped over part of the way through in order to finish viewing the film.  The newer release took care of this problem, but inability to view as it was originally released, combined with the still poor sound and picture quality make for a great deal of disappointment in viewing.

This is a great movie, it should not be receiving such sub standard handling when being offered on DVD.",1297382400,4,1435,4.393939393939394

However, although the packaging for this theatrical edition is new and advertises a new DVD, the DVD is clearly from the awful earlier release. The problems with the old release is that you are inexplicably forced to eject and flip the disc halfway through the film, which is also presented in the horrible non-anamorphic widescreen format- both of these limitations are almost unheard of. The new packaging in this release claims that it is an anamorphic format, and this is the first DVD out of thousands I've purchased that has ever brazenly lied about that. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.

439463,5,6302206294,"Robin Hood prince of Thieves is actually one of the least Hollywoodized version of a Robin Hood movie. The action seems real enough (apart the catapult one which is just) and the actors are living the part. Kevin Costner hasn't got an English accent but then,what was the accent then? At least he is a believable Robin and of course Alan Rickman is for sure,the Sheriff. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is believable also. The newest Robin Hood (2010) is too raw and it should not have copied Gladiator in the mood. Robin Hood is a legend but with a purpose: the brave action of one to help many,for a more just lifestyle. be it a legend or not,the story is uplifting and hat is positive. It has been known that such a story inspire some to protect the weaker (I did and am known for it). So,just take it for what it is: A great flick for action and some humor with uplifting music and an inspiring message that injustice must be fought against.

439482,1,6302206294,"If it's not King Arthur corrupting the use of Hadrian's Wall, then it must be....Robin Hood! Most of the reviews talk about the quality of the transfer or the cinematography.  This movie is nothing but incredible nonsense historically.  The first problem is that the movie leaves out the chief antagonist, King Richard's despotic and younger brother Prince John and focuses its entire attention on the Sheriff of Nottingham [John and the Sheriff represent reactionary Norman exclusivity and materialism, unlimited domination and unrestrained taxation while Richard and Robin stand for the rule of law, religious tolerance and the unity of all of peoples inhabiting England].  The city of Nottingham is nowhere near Hadrian's Wall as it is in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, yet here we have Robin Hood strolling over Hadrian's Wall in extreme northern England as he returns from the Crusades!  Of course, the screenwriters need Hadrian's Wall in order to introduce the cataclysmic ""Star Wars""-like battle-scene-in-the-trees between the bloodthirsty and inappropriately-named ""Celts"" and the outlaws (Saxons), because no self-respecting Celt lived near Sherwood Forest at this time in reality, having been purged from this area by the Romans ten centuries earlier!

No ones knows if the tautologically-described ""Celts"" are Britons, Scots or Picts and, truth is, no one really cares--it is just the fiery action that matters!  There is an apparent but nonsensical trichotomy between the Saxons (now the outlaws hiding out in Sherwood Forest but once the original English), the ""Celts"" (even earlier native romanized Welsh or non-romanized Picts or Scots) and the new rulers, the Norman French.  How the Sheriff gets the Celts to fight for him when they hated Norman French control, were once allied with the Saxons and, after he lost his accumulated taxes of gold to Robin Hood, is never explained. Another uncomfortable plot error? Perhaps he just offered them a pig roast and some beer, after all, we are supposed to believe that all these folks care about is fighting, right?  Never mind, it's just a movie, the plot is not supposed to make sense!  Note to Hollywood:  at least find a different location to shoot at, this viewer is tired of seeing Hadrian's Wall misused in every motion picture!",1285804800,2,2306,5.208108108108108
439483,4,6302206294,Loved watching again with some extra added scenes that give a little more depth to this storyline of Robin Hood.,1285372800,,112,4.65
439484,5,6302206294,"For those of you who are unfamiliar with the history of the British Isles, a little background information might be helpful. The original settlers were the Celts, who arrived from central Europe, principally Austria. Several centuries later a group of settlers from Saxony in Eastern Germany arrived and eventually took control of the islands. They brought the English language with them and suppressed the Gaelic languages of the Irish, Welsh and Scots.
This conflict between the two groups can be seen in the legends of the Celts, beginning with King Arthur and continuing with Robin Hood. Thus,in the film Robin Hood the Sheriff of Nottingham represents the Saxons and Robin Hood represents the earlier Celtic settlers.
Finally, to liven things a bit, we have Kevin Costner as the surfer dude from California who hit a big wave and ended up in Sherwood Forest. He represents the third wave of settlers from the new world who are buying castles all over the British Isles and corrupting the English language. If this trend continues, all of the British Isles will become states in the USA.",1285027200,,1091,4.967213114754099

Sometimes these movies are edited well from the start and that has been the case with this movie. It wears a little long and has some pacing issues that the original did not. Some of the edited scenes drastically effect the movie and I felt in a very negative way. I have the original version on DVD and will continue to watch it rather than this one. On top of that their is very little in extras on the bluray. Just some different commentaries. So its a lose lose for me. Its a shame too.

439514,5,6302206294,"This was the Robin Hood movie when I was growing up.  Allong with the Disney animated version, this movie is what I judge all other things Robin Hood by.  I remember when I first knew about this film coming out, when the toys first hit the toy store.  I wasn't old enough to corolate the toys to a new film, but i remember that they had real strings with plastic arrows you could shoot, and cloth robes detachable wristbands.  The summer it came out, it was everywhere.  In the cereal, at burgerking.  As a kid I was enthralled the whole film from beginning to end.  The movie never slows down, because even during the dialogue scenes, the characters are always in movement, and being firey.  Maid Marrion sticks up for herself, as I have seen her portraid in each subsequent version of the film.  The sherriff of this version is thee sherriff and one of the best hollywood villains of all time.  I remember everyone loved this movie, and when it came out on VHS, everyone owned a copy and everyone played it at family functions and the like.  Until the mid nineties you just couldn't escape this film.  I remember by the end of its run I was starting to really get tired of it, but it still holds a special place for me.  It was very current when it came out.  Strong female lead, making sure to put a likable ethnic character, though what the Moors where doing in Arabia during that time I may never know, but I guess a black actor was more accepted at the time than an Arab, who spouts wisdom about god being color blind.  They make sure that he makes a fool of robin so that he is not just the side kick.  Considering that at the time there was a contenent wide war with muslims at the time, it wasn't just an issue of race as alluded to in the film, but a general hatred and fear of foreign ideology, I don't see the reactions being as light as introverted as portrayed in the film, but more reflective of 90's post ""Do the Right Thing"" Culture.  At the time this movie was cutting edge, which of course dates it now, and there is enough there to make the more PC of us cringe, but as a children's adventure story, I don't think a more fun adaptation exists.  One more thing, people complain about the accents, and though I understand the complaints, this is not a historical piece.  This is a fantasy for children and the young at heart for a legend.  When I would play Robin Hood in the back yard there were no accents, nor did I expect there to be.  We don't expect period pieces to be in King's English, because they wouldn't be as accessable.  this movie is very accessable and fun.",1280880000,5,2592,4.31198347107438

Special extended disk has a featurette, the Bryan Adams music video for the theme song, and interviews with main cast members.  If you are into this type of thing it's ok.  The featurette appears to be made around the time that the movie itself was made.  Contains a few interesting facts but nothing super special.  A young Pierce Brosnan narrates it, and is kind of cheesey and entertaining in itself.  There is also a behind the scenes section, which is disappointing.  It contains four topics of subjects for you to READ about.  In the whole special features part they never address why Kevin Costner never used an English accent, which to me did not at all affect my enjoyment of the film but none the less should have been explained (I suspect he just couldn't pull it off convincingly).

439588,3,6302206294,"...is what a commercial advertising the 1938 version of Robin Hood had to say in the summer of 1991 regarding the advertisement for this film claiming ""This summer Kevin Costner is Robin Hood"". The voice of the pronouncement was from the actor that defined the role of Robin Hood and the role of the swashbuckler in general - Errol Flynn.

Not only does Kevin Costner not sound like Robin Hood, he doesn't act like him either. His performance doesn't even come close to that of Flynn. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is good enough in her performance as Marian, but still you can't compare the chemistry between Errol Flynn and Olivia De Haviland to whatever is there between 1991's Marian and Robin. Do note that this version does show more of the tragedy that befalls the peasants than was present in the 1938 version. This emphasis on tragedy and drama is probably there to offset the fact that since Kevin Costner can't even begin to swash Errol Flynn's buckle, and comes across more like a social worker who is good at archery, the film had to take the emphasis off of the great fun and energy of Robin Hood himself.

The one saving grace of this film is Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. His use of the black arts is shown openly as was not possible in the 1938 version, demonstrating the true evil measure of the man, and at the same time he gets off some great comic one liners and manages to steal the picture. Claude Raines, who played Prince John in the 1938 version, would have been proud of this performance.

If you want to see an intentionally comic rendition of Robin Hood, see Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"". That movie succeeded at least partially by playing off some of the ludicrous aspects of this one. As for Warner Bros., if you want to update some of your old DVD's how about a new standard DVD release of ""Stand and Deliver"". The original is now twelve years old.",1258243200,,1901,4.536443148688047
439589,5,6302206294,"I remember when this movie came out.  I went to watch it three times and that is really saying something coming from me.  Well when I found this, I was like ""Yea!!!!!!!!""  Bought it and watched and LOVED all the new scenes that were originally deleted.  It is the best Robin Hood even if several actors do not have English accents ;)",1256256000,,333,4.32258064516129
439590,3,6302206294,"Were Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Sean Connery not in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, I would have passed on both the original and extended DVDs. Despite the fine production design, great location cinematography and some now-classic lines, the film is at best a fun but forgettable two-star effort.

An uneven screenplay with jerrymandered plot devices (was 13th century England really that PC?), inconsistent direction, careless editing, and an American actor who plays Robin Hood like a Huntington Beach surfer visiting a medieval theme park, are the reasons I downgraded this version of the outlaw legend. IMO Errol Flynn's 1938 vigorous swashbuckler is superior to Kevin Costner's 1991 reluctant-hero epic in every way.

With one notable exception.

The third star is for Alan Rickman (better known nowadays as Hogwarts teacher Professor Snape). I understand the English actor was given carte-blanche to do what he wanted with his villain's role. Thank God, for he saved this picture by stealing it outright. His performance as the demented, manic and lecherous Sheriff of Nottingham is a comedic tour de force. Rickman schemes, roars, slithers and hisses -- and delivers some of the best lines in the script like a vulture picking over entrails to devour. To wit:

Sheriff of Nottingham: Wait a minute. Robin Hood steals money from my pocket, forcing me to hurt the public, and they love him for it?
[Scribe nods]
Sheriff of Nottingham: That's it then. Cancel the kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans, no more merciful beheadings. And call off Christmas.

Sheriff of Nottingham: [to a wench] You. My room. 10:30 tonight.
Sheriff of Nottingham: [to another wench] You. 10:45... And bring a friend.

I can guess why many of Rickman's scenes were cut from the theatrical release. It wasn't just for time or relevance; when he's on screen you don't see anyone else. He's that good.

Other actors deserve praise for breathing life into their stock characters. Morgan Freeman as Robin's loyal Islamic friend Azeem, the fierce yet dignified ""painted man"", is wonderful to watch and listen to -- but when isn't he? IMO Freeman is incapable of giving a bad performance. The same is true of several veteran British actors in the cast: Brian Blessed (Lord Locksley), Nick Brimble (Little John), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck) and Geraldine McEwan (the twisted Mortianna). I also bend my knee to the always majestic Sean Connery for an uncredited cameo.

I like Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio's acting, but IMO her Lady Marian was undermined by the director's lack of focus. She is introduced as a knife-wielding Norman maid in men's clothing who is running her family's estate, but in the climactic fight scene she's running around and screaming like a helpless twit. Wha'? I also feel that Christian Slater was miscast as Will Scarlett. He comes off as a charmless whiner whose act you never quite buy. And while Slater vaguely resembles Costner, the two actors lack the requisite chemistry to be familial colleagues.

The bottom line: Pass on this one unless you're a hardcore Kevin Costner fan. (I like KC but not in this film.) Choose Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood instead as the gem of this genre. But consider RHPOF for Alan Rickman's over-the-top performance as the evil sheriff. He will not disappoint.",1254787200,3,3317,5.06043956043956

439613,2,6302206294,"I have heard this movie bantered around so much that I finally broke down and decided to watch it.
Robin Hood (Kevin Costner) returns to England from the Crusades with Azeem (Morgan Freeman), a Moor whom he saved in his escape from prison.  Upon their arrival, they learn that the Sherriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) has killed Robin's father and keeper of the lands (Brian Blessed) in the absence of King Richard (Sean Connery!).  Now, Robin wishes vengeance for his father's death, to rid the lands of the horrid Sherriff, and to woo the lovely Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).
I know very little about the Robin Hood legend or myth (other than multiple childhood viewings of the Disney version of Robin Hood, which I am sure is less than accurate), so I can't really say much on the accuracy of the movie from a historical standpoint.  What I can say is how terrible it was from a viewer's standpoint.
But, first the good.  Then the bad.
The two highlights of this film were hands-down Morgan Freeman as the Moor, Azeem, and Alan Rickman as the Sherriff of Nottingham.  Both lit up the screen whenever they appeared and were a pure joy to watch.  Morgan Freeman, I felt, really captured his character (though, as others have said, the likelihood that a Moor would be so ""welcomed"" in England in this era is rather suspect).  I love his independence, yet devotion to Robin Hood.  In some ways, I feel he was a better sidekick than Little John (which is kinda sad, as I thought Little John was Robin Hood's sidekick, but alas, Hollywood changes history as it sees fit).  Too bad he wasn't in Moor of it (har har).  Alan Rickman seemed to be having marvelous fun and was positively delicious in this film.  He, hands down, gets the best lines from the riotous ""I'll cut your heart out with a spoon"" to his wonderful pickup lines ""You. My room. 10:30 tonight. You. 10:45... And bring a friend"".  Somehow, he is able to balance being wicked and laugh out loud funny and most definitely makes the other characters look like they are taking themselves WAY too seriously.
However, for the rest of the movie, I can't be so kind.  Kevin Costner as Robin Hood was cringe-worthy.  He was overdramatic, had no English accent (yeah, yeah, so there was a fight with the director, I get it), and was all around a pain to watch (and yes, I found him rather unattractive, which doesn't usually matter, but when all you're doing is staring at him and listening to him overact, it would be nice to have something nice to look at).  I found myself talking with my sister, my viewer in crime, during his scenes (aka most of the movie).
Speaking of Marian, Maid Marian was terribly done (Probably not all Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's fault, though I wasn't much fond of the actor).  As per Hollywood standards, we HAVE to have her introduced as a kick butt girl (in disguise as a man no less!), but then, in the end, she must be rescued from attempted rape by Robin??  Where is the ninja from the first part?  Why must the action girl always disappear so her ""True Love"" must rescue her?  Get a grip girlfriend!
And that was just the two man characters!  We haven't gotten to the plot yet!
I felt the story started way too early.  We have to watch Robin escape jail in the Holy Lands (agonizing), roll around in the sand on England (ridiculous), and parade across the land, saving the requisite child who gets chased into the tree by the Bad GuysTM (I am beginning to think I could write a script!).
But there is hope!  A shred of excitement begins, watching Robin take charge of the Merry Men (a little odd that he just usurps power from Little John, and I would LOVE to find out how they can melt iron and steel in the open air without blowers), his men ambushing caravans, and in general robbing from the rich to save the poor.  Great, perhaps this will make the movie worth it!  But then it is destroyed miserably when two ""Merry Men"" (actually the two stupidest of the bunch) attempt to ambush Marian and her requisite unattractive maid.  Of COURSE the two are escorted to the camp, of COURSE, they are blindfolded (so they can leave), and of COURSE, they get to see Robin Hood (Costner's body double) in the buff.  And why, must I ask, does he have a nude scene?  It makes absolutely zero sense and reduces what relationship he and Marian have to pure lust.  Gross.  As if that wasn't disgusting enough, Robin has to give Marian a tour (yawn), coo over her (wince), snuggle next to a campfire (groan), and leap to the aid of Little John's wife as she delivers a baby via Caesarean, thanks to the sudden midwife, Azeem.  What the heck is a childbirth scene doing in an action/adventure movie like Robin Hood?  Are we trying to draw the ER crowds or something?  Not to mention, Caesarean?  In this age (okay, so maybe I have a better feel for historical accuracy than I thought), I can't believe it would be doable and that the woman would survive!  At this point, I was completely outraged and screaming at the TV.
So besides two great, under-used actors (oh, the Friar was a kick, but unfortunately, he was underused too as was the maaaaaaaaaahvelous Sean Connery), the movie is drivel.  It reeks so bad of Hollywoodization, if you watch, you may want to bring a clothespin.  Easily over-powered women, predictable plot, horrid romance, and overdone acting.  I would suggest watching Freeman's and Rickman's performances only and skipping through the rest.  2 stars I feel is being more than generous.

Oh, it was awful, and even Alan couldn't justify a purchase for me.  Kevin Costner has the emotional range of a hot dog vendor at a baseball game in all his films, and sadly has the lion's share of screen time in them as well.

Then I heard about this version through some fan sites and took a chance.  No, the added Rickman footage doesn't make much difference ultimately to the story line, but who cares?  His scenery chewing is positively gleeful in the deleted material, and twice as much fun to watch.  It's easy to see why Costner demanded his scenes be cut out, because he steals even more of the movie (as he always does) with them in.

Thoughtfully, the DVD has bookmarks at most of Rickman's parts, so it's fairly easy to skim over all the boring Robin Hood stuff.

Robin of Loxley ralleys the merry men of Sherwood Forest and this band of brothers proceeds to wreak havok on the Sheriff's plans.  There is the classic sequence were clumsy bowmen become accurate archers, and raw recruits make home-made swords and become deft at handling them.  The drama builds to its final crescendo, where Robin and the Sherrif meet to play their version of final combat.

It's all a lot of fun with the required bantering, teasing and flirting between Robin Hood and his beloved.  The film has a good number of scenes where values like courage and others are taught, as Robin tries to convince the townspeople of the moral strength of their position.  On the downside, there are the typical incredulous happenings - last minute getaways and such - but all approprioate for the ultimate goal of the plot.

The big issue is that its a flipper and that you had to flip the disc to watch the second half of the movie which is retarded, but mind you that the DVD did come out in 1997 and that the film's time limit was near 2 1/2 hours. Thankfully Warner Bros. came back and remastered this film in a brand new edition. The great news is that the whole movie is on one disc and that YOU DON'T NEED TO FLIP IT! THANK GOD! You can sit and watch a 2 1/2 hour flick all the way through with no changing or flipping discs! YES! What's new is extra footage put into the film which is not all enlightening but who cares? The second disc does not offer a whole lot but at least there is behind the scenes look and the Bryan Adams music video and the entire film's music score by the late Michael Kamen. Overall the movie is worth the watch and is probably Kevin Costner's last great film before his downside in movies. It is a long movie (the extended version is about 155 minutes) but I enjoy long movies. Think about it. It's worth the price in theaters nowadays. You pay 9 bucks just to see a 90-minute picture? Give me a break!!! I would rather pay 9 bucks just to see a 2 1/2 to 3 hour picture so it will be worth it. Not including the snacks and drinks I probably would be forced to buy as well.

439748,3,6302206294,"The final verdict on ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is that Kevin Costner is no Errol Flynn.  True, it is often unfair to compare a remake to a hugely successful original, especially since the goals of each are sometimes divergent.  In this case, however much I tried to see Costner's thoughful and intellectual Robin Hood as the driving force, I still harkened back to the sheer exuberance that Flynn invested his part.  Further, I could have lived with and even enjoyed on its own merits Costner's low key performance had it not been for the over the top campy performance of Alan Rickman as the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham.  With each time Rickman mugged for the camera, he became the focus of that scene.  Even when Costner and Rickman met several times, Costner's Robin Hood took a decided back seat to Rickman's Sheriff. As I compared Costner to Flynn, so did I compare Rickman to Claude Rains in THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST.  Rains's Sheriff was as equally oily as Rickman's, but Rains had the good sense to let Basil Rathbone do the sword play.  In PRINCE OF THIEVES, Rickman tries to do too much and to the extent that he succeeds the film reduces Costner to little more than a talky bystander.

Still, PRINCE OF THIEVES is enjoyable as spectacle even if Rickman steals the show on too many occasions.",1222560000,,1312,4.64935064935065

439784,1,6302206294,"The legend of Robin Hood is a myth but its based on a number of real political and historical issues. This awful mean spirited movie substitutes modern political notions for ancient ones.

The first modern agenda is the exaltation of blacks and moslems and the denigration of European whites. Simply put this is a racist movie. Morgan Freeman - an African American - is shown to be wise and civilized and the red headed Irish are portrayed as mindless savages. Not only is this offensive but it is bizarre. Islam to this day embraces the slavery of black Africans. Islam at the time of the crusades was not a place of racial harmony and enlightenment. Millions of blacks were marched across the Sahara for centuries. Most died. Those that didn't were given the most menial tasks. In Islam blacks were the least valued of slaves.

During the crusades, this movie would have you believe that an African who is also a Muslim could wander around England and be well accepted. He is shown giving a Caesarian operation to peasant's wife with his dagger. Really?

The second agenda is anti-clericism. The religious figures are depicted as impossibly evil. The medieval church had a lot of faults but these churchmen are laughably villianous. They seem modeled on Snidely Whiplash. Everything we know about the high middle ages tells us of the extreme devotion of the people to the Church. This ugly caracature of a history is agressively anti-Christian and pro-Islam.

It has been said that the all the inventions of Islam were by either Jews, Christians or Persians. The Arabs served to transport ideas from India and China toward the West, but like those other conquering people, the Mongols, they themselves made few contributions to civilization.

This propoganda movie turns all that on its head. Morgan Freeman is portrayed like a visitor from another planet with miraculous products of their advanced culture. This is just an anti-Western agenda. The creators of this film want to spread the notion that the roots of civilization were not European but Islamic.

There was of course a real political context to the Robin Hood legend. It revolved around the Norman - Saxon rift. It involved language - Germanic Saxon versus Norman French. It involved the very bad English King John and his conflict with the nobles leading to Magna Carta. It involved Richard Coeur de Lion.(This goofy movie has Richard who couldn't speak English at all speak with a Scottish accent. Ha!).

You would think that these real historical issues would provide enough material for a screenplay but instead we get a lecture on modern American race relations and the evils of Christanity. The plot seems to have been devised as an exhibit for Black History Month.",1215734400,5,2736,4.921908893709327

Robin, accompanied by a Moorish bodyguard (Morgan Freeman), flees into the forest, there to find the gang of outlaws of which he quickly becomes leader.

Robin Hood won't be left alone in the forest.  When the Sheriff captures some of Robin's merry men, and kidnaps Maid Marion, Robin and his remaining men will have to storm the Sheriff's castle.  The action is good to the last sword thrust, and there is a nice surprise cameo at the end of the movie by Sean Connerly, perfectly cast.  This isn't quite the standard telling of the Robin Hood, but there is enough acting to make it solidly entertaining and recommended.",1204416000,,907,4.825806451612904
439791,3,6302206294,"PLEASE NOTE: My review is for the Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood. For some reason, Amazon is currently grouping all the reviews from *both* the Costner and Bergin version of Robin Hoods.

Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves had a lot of potential. It had going for it a stellar cast including Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater & Alan Rickman. It had an epic storyline, handed down generation after generation, about one of the all-time classic heroes. It had a big production budget, and a memorable score. And yet... all that it managed was a decent action film.

Perhaps the biggest problem is Kevin Costner. His Robin Hood not only doesn't have an English accent (which is something easily forgiven), but also has a wooden, monotone personality (which is not). The others of Sherwood seem to find Robin inspiring, but I find him very dull -- he can't even muster real passion for Marian. Costner has a long history of derailing movies, and he almost ruins this one, too.

Another problem that this movie suffers from is a needlessly bloated cast. For some reason, the makers of the film weren't content with the Robin Hood legend, as-is. They thought that it needed more characters. And so, they invent a witch, and a young boy, and an blind servant, and a snarky moor, etc. Some of these characters wind up becoming more central than even Robin Hood staples, like Little John and Friar Tuck (wonderfully played by Who's Line Is It Anyway regular, Mike McShane). It makes a person wonder why. Why did we need to make up these new characters, when all it really served to do was to take away from the others? No one, other than Costner and Rickman as the villain, winds up getting a lot of screentime.

This movie would be a lot worse than it is, if anyone other than Alan Rickman had played the Sheriff of Nottingham (who also assumes Prince John's usual role of usuper). Rickman is superb in just about everything he does, and he is perfectly cast here. ""At least I didn't use a spoon,"" is a line my friends and I still quote to each other, all these years later. Alan Rickman is the one true spark in this otherwise tepid film.

Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves had a lot of potential. Ultimately, it turned out an action flick that was fun enough to watch on the big screen, but doesn't really hold up in the living room, years later. It suffers from a pointlessly changed storyline, bloated cast, and a stone-faced, one-tone delivery from Kevin Costner. It is relieved by some of the strong performers in its cast, most notably Alan Rickman, who is a perfect Nottingham/John villain.

ETC: interviews with the cast pre and post produciton of the film, making of, documentaries, a history of Robin Hood, and live performances from Ireland with Bryan Adams performing the hit single from the movie.

However, I really really don't want a remake, because Alan most likely will not be in it, and hence, its utterly pointless. Still, even with Costner, the movie is quite enjoyable.

439824,2,6302206294,"This is a really, really dull, boring, ultimately pointless film.  As many here have said, it's a revisionist Robin Hood, and it's a revisionist bore.  Here Kevin Costner portrays Robin Hood as a ""good guy trying to do the right thing"", not as a flamboyant, larger than life character, like he was in the Errol Flynn version.  Costner is particularly lifeless here, with an accent (as many have noted) that comes and goes.  It's either his real voice or a really bad English accent, and both are in the film, which is a textbook example of sloppy filmmaking.  The only character full of life is Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham.  He's so over the top you end up liking him more than Costner's stiff Robin Hood.  The film is directed rather stodgily by Kevin Reyonlds, director of the infamous Waterworld (which is a little more interesting than this film).

The point of Robin Hood was that he is larger than life, he's not a ""good guy"".  You're supposed to cheer and adore him (like many did with Errol Flynn), not say ""he's nice, and he's doing his best"".  Robin Hood is not a regular sort of bloke, he's a flamboyant, cascading man.  I know I sound corny, but I would take a flamboyant Errol Flynn over Costner's deliberately dulled down portrayal here.  Even PC friendly additions of women to the merry men and a stronger, more decisive Marian don't make the film any better or worse.  It's almost like they said ""let's make it as bland as oatmeal"", except someone forgot to tell Alan Rickman, but that's OK.  I'm giving the film 2 stars because of him.

439827,3,6302206294,"NB: Since Amazon are posting reviews for this under both the rival Costner and Patrick Bergin versions, this review is for the Costner version.

It's Hollywood, not Sherwood, with Kevin Costner fighting injustice in his quest to make England free for those who can't actually speak the language, armed only with his trusty longbow, a dubious accent (""This is English courage"" gets a big laugh every time), a fluctuating waistline and an unerringly bad sense of direction. ""Come, by nightfall we will dine at my father's castle,"" he says to his Muslim sidekick Azem (Morgan Freeman). Not when you land in Dover you won't. And Hadrian's Wall is NOT ""but five miles"" from Nottingham. Sorry, Kev.

You have to look a long way down the credits to find an English actor, unless you count the villains, with Alan Rickman's Sheriff so far over the top that he's back again, leaving you with the impression that Costner's controversial decision to cut many of his scenes had more to do with restraint than pique. With Christian I-Want-to-be-Jack-Nicholson-when-I-grow-up Slater in the cast, you can forgiven for fearing the film will turn into Surf Saxons Must Die, and British writers Pen Densham and John Watson do display a healthy contempt for their heritage and history. No-one actually says it, but you know they're thinking ""screw history, let's blow something up,"" and, indeed, the script manages to pull of the twin feat of giving a logical reason for Robin having a black sidekick and getting lots of explosions into a medieval adventure, although they don't quite manage to convince you that their Robin truly is modelled after the Tim Holt character in The Magnificent Ambersons.

Neither Errol Flynn's definitive adventure nor Sean Connery and Richard Lester's brilliantly melancholy interpretation have anything to worry about, with the film falling between the two stools and offering political correctness instead of revisionism and opting for pure adventure with the trimmings of gritty historical realism brushed aside whenever it threatens to get in the way.

The biggest problem is that the scars of a messy and acrimonious production (seven credited producers, no less) are all too visible. Kevin Reynolds' direction lacks the punch of his earlier and unfairly overlooked The Beast of War or even his bonkers Rapa Nui, with some uncomfortable medium shots and the unsteadiest Steadicam work in cinema history, while subplots such as the black magic element are thrown away after the early scenes. On the plus side, Michael Kamen's score is his most enjoyable and exciting, John Bloomfield's costumes are terrific, Doug Milsome's photography almost camouflages the bad weather and some of the action scenes are well handled, although it's hard to imagine anyone here giving Basil Rathbone or even Robert Shaw too much trouble in a swordfight.",1197763200,,2853,5.155507559395248

I think building on the backstory of the main character, giving the villains and supporting characters their own interesting connections, twists, and intrigues, and the reflection on the crusades just gives the story that much more weight and, in my opinion, realism. Otherwise it would be just a classic everyday fairy tale, a la Disney's version of the legend.

And I agree with the editorial that Costner's lack of accent is a small distraction. Personally I think he fit the role just fine; I think that lightweight nonchalance about his acting serves well to keep the movie from bogging down and taking itself too seriously.

Mary Elizabeth Masterantonio was an excellent choice. She performs with a forceful confidence that really gives her character the strength to just light up the screen.

And if anything I would give the movie 5 stars for Alan Rickman's performance alone. He brings that wit and touch of goofiness to his role that creates a villain that's just a blast to watch.

It has some of the same characters and some of the same plot, but it parts company with the Robin Hood legend early on and doesn't look back.

I'm sure you're familiar with the basic plot. Robin Hood gets pissed off at the Norman nobility and goes on a rampage, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. He thwarts the wiles of the evil Prince John and his minion, the Sheriff of Notingham, whil at the same time winning the heart of the lovely Maid Marion.

Some of that is even in this movie!

Of course, Prince John is left out, as is the famous archery competition. Added in is a completely useless Moorish character who had no place in the film and does not appear at all in the Robin Hood legends. Clearly he was added in some pointless attempt to make the movie more, shall we say, colorful (the same reason we have a sub-Saharan African character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator-Extended-Edition-Three-Disc-Extended-Edition/dp/B0009QTS1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator - Extended Edition (Three-Disc Extended Edition)</a>, though at least in that case we aren't butchering a legendary story to add him in.

The movie actually stops half way through and instructs you to flip it over so you can finish watching it!!  This is definitely a major downside.  It's a great movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, I would strongly suggest watching it at some point.

Then they make this 2 disc special edition with a whole lot of new scenes that totally didn't need to be in the movie. Plus, they don't even include the original version on the 2 disc special edition. Jesus christ, what does a person have to do to get a great movie decently put on dvd?

Unfortunately, while the extended footage was a welcome addition (much of it deals with the Sheriff's past and his relationship with Mortiana, the witch) I found several key pieces of dialogue from the theatrical version missing from the extended version of the film.  One such missing exchange takes place when Sir Guy returns after being bested by Robin for the first time, in the theatrical version he explains to his cousin, the Sheriff, that Robin is traveling with a man who carries a Sarisan sword; this important piece of information is never presented to the Sheriff in the extended version so its a bit jarring when, in the next scene, he deduces that the painted man the witch is referring to in her vision is Robin's companion.  Another important scene missing is the Sheriff's first confrontation with Robin in the Bishop's quarters.  Its ridiculous that this film cuts the part where Robin gives the Sheriff a cut on his cheek, and I can't figure out if it was cut due to some sort of censorship or the editor fell asleep in the cutting room.  There are several more instances of missing dialogue I found, but since its been years since I last saw this film and not having the theatrical version to compare it to I can't be sure how much was altered for this special edition.

In my opinion there is no reason to buy this version of the movie, unless you really want to see the extended scenes or the special features. The audio is sub-par for a 2nd print, special edition DVD release, the picture quality is noticeably in need of touch ups and the special features, while a pleasant addition, really don't warrant the extra cost over the theatrical release.

439920,5,6302206294,"`Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves' released in '91 is a terrific re-visioning of the Robin Hood mythos and by far my favorite Kevin Costner film.

Costner delivers a strong and likeable performance as Robin and Alan Rickman does what he does best in the role of his adversary, the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham. The film also contains a solid performance by Morgan Freeman as Moorish warrior and Robin's companion Azeem. His inclusion was a wonderful addition to the usual storyline.

The films excellent production values; beautiful cinematography, wonderful period costumes, romantic and uplifting music, inventive storyline and superior cast make for an exciting adventure all around. One of the major complaints most reviewers have with this movie seem to center on Kevin Costner portrayal of Robin of Locksley.

439932,4,6302206294,"Eight hundred years ago, Richard the Lionheart led the third Great Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land from the Turks... Most of the young English noblemen who flocked to his banner never returned home... The film opens near Jerusalem in a terrible dungeon where Robin of Locksley is about to show the 'English' courage...

Locksley manages to escape with a fellow prisoner, a Moor called Azeem, and flees home to England...

On his arrival to Britain, the prodigal son finds dark forces plotting against his absent king... His father has been slain and his lands confiscated by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham...

To evade Gisborn's soldiers, Locksley heads off to the supposedly haunted Sherwood Forest, where he takes his chance with ghosts, and where he is accosted by a band of outlaws...

Like Burt Lancaster in 'The Flame and the Arrow,' Costner tries to lead the woodsmen in a revolt against injustice and tyranny, but misses the youthful exuberance and passion of Dardo...

Costner looks handsome as the legendary Prince of Thieves who must use his mastery of archery, siege warfare, and combat strategy to rescue his beloved damsel...

Morgan Freeman looks great as Azeem, the wizard with uncommon clarity of mind, who vows to repay Robin for saving his life... His knowledge of science is a surprising blow...

Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio is Robin's beautiful and clever companion whose love for the arrogant young nobleman led her to see him taking her advice in Sherwood Forest...

Alan Rickman fluctuates between being a comic buffoon and a dangerous madman... He plays the Sheriff of Nottingham who has no limit to his ambitions...

Christian Slater is the hot tempered 'turncoat' with enough reason to hate Robin than any one else...

Geraldine McEwan is the ugly witch who saw the 'painted man' haunting her dreams...

Michael McShane is the natural charisma who would not strike a fellowman of the cloth... In fact he will help him pack for his journey with lots of gold...

Michael Wincott is the Sheriff's nefarious cousin who justifies his intrusion with news of profound value: 'I met a hooded man today who made me warn you not to harm his people.'

Nick Brimble is the best man of the woods who challenges Robin for his sacred gold medallion...

Walter Sparrow is the loyal servant to the Locksleys who has lost his vision by the Sheriff's own cruelty...

Harold Innocent is the corrupt churchman who accuses innocent men of witchcraft and let them die...

There are beautiful, breathtaking, and amusing scenes: Robin's father, dressed in his black battle armor on top his black stallion, preparing to battle the 'men in masks'; sweeping shots of the English countryside as Robin and Azeem escape Sir Guy of Gisborn and his soldiers; the bout with quarterstaves across a stream; plenty of flaming arrows flowing through the greenwood along with some exciting fighting; and like Burt Lancaster in ""The Flame and the Arrow,"" who pauses in the middle of a frantic battle to plant a kiss on a kitchen maid, Alan Rickman plants his kiss on Maid Marian in the middle of his frantic duel with Costner...

The majestic cameo (one of the best in epic movies) at the end of the film by a great, iconic figure, makes the movie just the right mix of adventure, humor, and romance...",1168473600,4,3291,4.879712746858169

I first saw it at around 7 yrs. old i think, and I loved the specific feel to it, the way you can just escape to this period and experience it like you are there. The cast is great.. Morgan Freeman is amazing as always etc.. and Kevin Costner is... well, Kevin Costner. Reading other reviews, especially by historians, critics seem to hate how he doesn't really played the part he should have, for one thing, at least try to have an accent, but I think his American accent and attitude in the movie really made  me like it even more, because it really is one of a kind when looking at other medieval-based movies. It's over-the-top, glaringly inaccurate, and I love it for exactly what it is! Remember like-minded history buffs: don't expect this to be rigidly framed to the actual legend.

439937,4,6302206294,"Review Disclaimer:  Please note, this review is for the original DVD release, not the special edition 2 disc set.

First of all, I know this will get me a few unhelpful votes, but I have to get this off my chest.  This is the first DVD I have ever seen, that requires you to turn the disc over to watch the 2nd half of the movie.  This movie was no longer than 160 minutes (I forget the exact length) and I have watched plenty of 2 hour plus movies, and TV sets, which last up to 3+ hours per disc.  For the life of me, I don't know why the production company decided to split up this movie.

Since this was very unclear on the copy I rented, I inadvertently, started the DVD on the side of the 2nd half of the movie, being completely clueless why the movie started in such an unusual way.  Keep in mind, so very few DVD's are like this. Also, the movie starts up right away, and no menu pops up, so you are clueless.

I can only remember Laser Disc movies doing this, of which I am also a collector, so I would think that my knowledge of this format is what made me realize what the problem was, as quickly as I did.  I'm sure other customers must have had this same issue, I'll check the reviews after I get done writing this one.

Now, the movie:  Phenomenal, understated, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography.  Kevin Costner does the worst British accent I've ever heard (Hello, Madonna!), but that is beside the point.  I think he does a wonderful rendition.

I would love to see the special edition of this movie sometime.  Maybe I'll rent it.

439940,4,6302206294,"I have always loved this movie, and was really excited to see there was an extended edition.  This edition really is extended though. There is an extra 10-15 minutes of scenes that were previously cut from the movie.  Most of the scenes that were added have to do with the Sheriff of Nottingham and the witch sub-plot going more into depth about their relationship.  It was interesting to see the stuff the got cut from the movie, but it did get cut out for a reason.  This DVD has the deleted scenes integrated into the film as you watch it.  There is no feature that allows you to watch the originally edited version.  In my opinion the new scenes totally break the flow of the movie.  The editor knew what he was doing originally.

Besides the issue with the intgrated deleted scenes, I have one other issue: the grapics for the menus are cheesy and poorly done.  But that is just a little innoying.

This DVD does have some other great features though.  Lots of great little tidbits like interviews, commentaries, histories, a live version of Bryan Adams' ""Everything I Do"", and even a soundtrack feature to listen to just the music.

Overall this edition is a world of improvement over the old one. The extended edition has some great stuff on it, but i'm just a little disappointed with how some of it is presented.",1154044800,2,1321,4.5508474576271185

That would be unfair to those who can act and pull off an accent at the same time. Costner doesn't use an accent because the Director told him not to. Notice near the end of the film when he covers himself in horse manure and pretends to be a blind man, he ""runs"" into an English guard and does an accent. So, not necessarily that he can't do it, he wasn't recommended to.

It's a brilliant romantic movie. Many goofs, but it's intended to be a more comical movie rather than many other action based, historical Robin Hoods.",1153872000,,686,4.317829457364341

439965,3,6302206294,"I liked this movie a great deal.  It was a very entertaining movie, with a story more than decent enough for a swashbuckler movie, great production values, and plenty of action.  Of course, it's not without its flaws.  Costner is simply badly miscast.  I say that not because of his American accent, which is really a very minor blemish on the film, but because he plays basically the same character in every film -- a quiet, contemplative, angst-ridden nice guy.  This is really not the ideal characterization for a swashbuckling hero (though it would have been appropriate for a character study movie such as Sean Connery's ""Robin and Marian"" -- however that role was filled to perfection by Connery).  Costner never would have gotten the part had he not been riding high from the success of ""Dances with Wolves"" at the time, and thus been able to write his own ticket.  This is yet another film in movie history where a part was badly miscast because the producers wanted to get the hottest current name on the theater marquees.  I'll also never understand all the acclaim Alan Rickman got for his portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Rickman was brilliant in ""Die Hard"", but his portrayal of the Sheriff is so outrageous that it descends into the realm of caricature.  It makes the Sheriff amusing, which he should never be.  Also marring the film are some historical howlers.  The ""Celts"" that the Sheriff hires to attack Robin and his outlaws are presumably referred to by that name in order to try to make them generic, and thus avoid offending the Irish, Scots, and Welsh by characterizing them explicitly as barking savages.  But not only would any of these Celtic peoples have been referred to as Irish, Scots or Welsh by the English at this time, they would have looked and acted nothing like the stereotypical, fur-clad barbarians seen here.  But the movie was still good, and plenty of fun.

I also feel I must correct a point another reviewer raised about King John.  Not only does the movie not suffer for lack of him as a villain (John was hardly the only brutal, villainous man in England, so other noblemen can fill that role more than adequately), but John, while far from a good king, has gotten a worse rap than he really deserves in some respects -- especially in comparison to his older brother Richard the Lionhearted.  In fact Richard was at least as bad as John was for squeezing the people for tax money.  He bled England white in order to pay for his military adventures in the Holy Land and in France, and spent only six months of a ten year reign in England.  John, though undeniably treacherous, vengeful, and suspicious to the point of near paranoia, at least stayed in England and tried to govern it.  His efforts, while not all that successful, were not entirely incompetent either.  Where Richard cared not a whit for England except for how much money he could wring out of it, John took a personal interest in the judicial and financial administration of the country, and he  can claim some responsibility for advances at the Exchequer, in the administration of justice, in methods of taxation and military organization, and in the grant of chartered privileges to towns.  His political judgement was actually not at all bad; it was his hot-tempered, treacherous, and vindictive character that led him to tread on the rights of his barons, and  overreach his authority on occasion, thus earning him his bad name.  And his conspicuous lack of military success throughout most of his reign (in an era when the warrior king was the ideal, and battlefield successes could trump many other faults) led his contemporaries and successors not to overlook these flaws, as they did sometimes in other, more militarily successful bad rulers.",1145577600,2,3770,4.780864197530864

She was Robin's EQUAL). Then there were the villians. Man, was Alan Rickman just DISGUSTING as the Sheriff? The only one worse was Geraldine McEwan. She was so so creepy and gross, but FUNNY.

I especially liked this version of the DVD. The extended scenes gave us a much better understanding of the Sheriff's motives. I almost felt sorry for him, but not quite! This was much better than your run-of-the-mill Robin Hood story. Yes, I'm taking off one star on this review because of Kevin Costner's accent, but overall, he was pretty good in this movie.

439993,4,6302206294,"I just wanted to begin by making clear that it is the Special Edition that I'm about to describe, as some of the reviews above seem a little incongruous.  But onwards...

The second disk contains the sort of extras you would expect for something labelled Special Edition:  Documentary, Cast Interviews, Production notes, an expo on medieval weopons.  Of particular note would be the inclusion of the video of Everything I do (I do it for You), which will be popular with fans of the Bryan Adams song.

Perhaps of greater significance is the inclusion of 12 extra minutes in the main feature film.  Most of these have extended scenes that were already present (so a good knowledge of the original movie may be required to spot some of the more subtle differences), but there are one or two whole new scenes that take in a sub-plot involving the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Fans of Alan Rickman's performance will be delighted to with this inclusion, as it gives an even greater showcase of his comic abilities.  Splicing the extra scenes into the film rather than giving them their own separate section on the extra DVD is also a nice touch and enhances the continuity of the film.

Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves therefore remains a rip-roaring adventure, but with this Special Edition the film certainly is enhanced, and despite relatively ordinary extras, is worthwhile for the extended sections of the film alone.",1139443200,3,1411,4.845833333333333

It moves along nicely, the heroes are heroic, the bad guy is just plain bad, to the point of losing it, and the final sequence is a riot.

I agree with some of the other reviewers who say Morgan Freeman is a high point for this movie.  I did think Alan Rickman was a little over the top, yet I don't find it unbelievable, as someone who has invested himself that much into taking over would be likely to lose it the further he got buried in his deceit and betrayal, especially when it seems the house of cards might come crashing down.

Kevin, well, in some ways he does a nice job, since to look at him, he looks like a handsome hero with a big heart.  But that awful accent will throw you at first.

Kevin Costner is so hit or miss with his movies, and this was definitely a big miss for him.  Morgan Freeman is truly wasted.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character is tough girl one minute and screaming helpless girl the next. The writer's could not seem to make up their minds regarding what they wanted her to do.

Don't get me wrong. The story still holds up fairly well and is enjoyable as an action movie, but is marred by the stilted acting from Kevin Costner and indeed even from the usually enjoyable Morgan Freeman. The movie was rushed into production and it shows in places. Out of the entire cast, only Rickman, McEwan, and a couple of the Merry Men seem to really be having fun; everyone else is very, very serious and oddly flat. Geraldine McEwan does not get enough credit for her role as the witch, Mortianna. She is clearly having a high old time as is her co-star, Alan Rickman. Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham is totally evil and completely mad and yet comes across as oddly sympathetic. He and McEwan are definitely the best reasons to watch this film. I didn't find the DVD extras that compelling. If you want to watch the commentaries, stick with the one that features the author, Pen Densham, Chris Slater, and Morgan Freeman. Kevin Reynolds (the director) and Kevin Costner also do a separate commentary, but they are so self-congratulatory and full of themselves that I just wanted to reach through the screen and strangle them.",1129507200,2,1320,4.897321428571429

Fans of the great Morgan Freeman or Alan Rickman may be tempted to buy or rent this film, but it is my duty to warn you to resist.  Morgan Freeman plays it straight and can't give a poor performance anyway, but we don't really care much about his character.  Alan Rickman, though, goes way past camp.  He's over the top without being entertaining.  But camp was a logical choice, given the unbelievably bad script. Rickman's associate is a witch, Morgana, and that whole storyline is jaw-droppingly bad. It's not even clear if it's supposed to be scary or funny or campy or what.  The witch seems to be popping in from some high school production of MacBeth and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, which wants to be taken seriously.  Maybe Rickman's performance would have worked if the direction weren't so bad and the director had cut the film differently.  The worst thing about the film is Kevin Costner, who appears to be trying to win the award for worst performance of the 1990s.  He's got my vote.  I had no idea he was such a terrible actor. I had seen trailers of this movie and avoided it for years, but it's much worse than I even thought possible.  Some of the supporting players are appealing--Nick Brimble as Little John is good--but the acting is generally very bad.  The script is abyssmal, and, although the director can shoot arrows flying towards the camera, he manages to make it boring. If you enjoy Freeman's or Rickman's acting, try Amistad or The Shawshank Redemption with Freeman and Something the Lord Made or The Barchester Chronicles with Rickman.",1123372800,12,1634,4.615916955017301

Otherwise, the film is an overblown super-hero comic book adaptation of the Robin Hood lore that is so Americanized (particularly with Costner's guttural accent)that it's inadvertently comical.  The ridiculous inclusion of Morgan Freeman as the Moor sidekick was nothing more than Hollywood PC brownie points to make sure everybody is fairly represented even though a Muslim/Moor in England at that time would not have been very well received with the Third Crusade going on against the Infidel; but never mind all that, this is Hollywood fantasy after all even though they try to pose it as real history.  The screenplay was OK but a good part of the script was nothing but a bunch of Hollywood jingoisms oversaturated with utterances of 'Freedom!; 'Our rights'; 'Liberty!' Unfortunately Hollywood forgets that the Magna Carta was not the Constitution and Saxon nobles were not the founders of the Republic. Hollywood seems to forget the fact that peasants were still serfs at the time bound to serve their Norman/Saxon lords without many rights or much representation as to anything. Robin of Locksley didn't change that status quo nor did he seem to care to: in those days the axe continued to drop quickly to sever the heads of the impertinent without much fanfare about personal rights.",1115251200,15,1488,5.136363636363637

The New Extended Release gets 3 stars.

I have a simple plea to film directors.  PLEASE STOP TURNING OUT DIRECTOR CUTS when you release older films out on DVD.

Case in point Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves.  The original cut was one of my favorite films of all time.  I love this movie but now with the additional deleted scenes put back into the film my love for it has dwindle.  Through out the original cut of the film there were winks and nods to certain elements in the film like the Sherrif being raised by a witch.  The additional scenes that further explains the Sherrif's background turns the movie from an old time action adventure into a campy cartoon.  Also there is a scene where a little girl goes to Morgan Freeman, who plays Robin's Moorish companion from the Crusades, and asks why did God paint him.  In the original cut Freeman explains with some charm and a smile and the scene cuts away but in this extended edition the holier than thou fryar marches in and confronts Freeman.  I do realize the extended scene was to further set up the differences between the two men and religions so to make it more meaningful when the come together to fight tyrany but I have to say in the end the dialogue is forced and it feels a bit like a lecture being acted out.  The editor of the original theatrical version of this film was wise to cut that scene short.

True the clarity of the digital transfer is much better than the previous DVD release (which was the theatrical version)and its nice that I don't have to flip the disc over to watch the second half of the movie but it matters little when dealing with the horrible alterations done to this film.

I'm sure this is part of a Warner Bros marketting ploy; continually ruining their film franchises all to make a few extra dollars.  Milk the buyer for all its worth.  First offer a dvd of the original release that has a lousy video and audio transfer.  Second offer a special edition dvd that offers better quality but also a version of the film that is not what audiences fell in love with and then lastly (hopefully) release a dvd that is the original theatrical release, with superior quality, and extras.  Well I say forget them.  I'm going back to my crappy old dvd.

Despite this and despite the strong American accents, I actually find it hard to completely loathe this movie. Perhaps it's due to watching it as a rather geeky young lad, when Kevin Costner actually seemed quite cool (- as opposed to the self-important, greasy goat turd I now realise he is). Or maybe it's down to the slow-mo arrow shooting scenes, which must have been a precursor to the whole John Woo white dove phenomena prevalent today.

I expect its more likely though that this films success is in a large part down to the performance of Alan Rickman as the Sherrif of Nottingham. A true pantomime villain that, despite Kevin Costners best efforts, prevents the film from taking itself too seriously.

440016,3,6302206294,"""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"" came out during the glory days of the Kevin Costner era. Of course many will say this was the beginning of his twilight years film-wise. After acting in Oliver Stone's masterful ""JFK"" Costner decided to take on a much less controversial role here, the results are half and half. Some have gone as far as to blame the movie's weak points on Costner's lame English accent, but that's not really the main flaw of the movie. ""Robin Hood"" suffers from weak screenwriting, some bad editing, photography choices and yes, there is some bad acting here. The movie is essentially a realistic take on the Robin Hood legend, much like ""First Knight"" would do with King Arthur some three, four years later. Director Kevin Reynolds tries to go for gritty tastes, gross close-ups and violent realism to make a ""different"" kind of movie. Sometimes it plays like a bad version of ""Braveheart."" The writing is thin and rushes forward without giving any characters or plot points space to breath. The best films stand the test of time even in their visual quality. Here the movie is split. There are some wonderful visuals such as the myst-enhanced scene where Robin bids farewell to his beloved or when Celtic riders storm Robin's lair and he saves a woman and her baby from a flaming tree. The arrow-shooting shots are still exciting and fun and the scenes where the forest gang build their fortress and weapons are full of detail. The flip side are sequences that are edited in a choppy, almost uncomfortable style with close-ups of characters that feel either weird or out of sync. Do we really need to be PUSHED INTO the face of the nasty old witch lady? The sequence where the sheriff tries to mary Miriam is badly done again with poor close-ups, dumb action and really poor dialogue. The entire logic of all a lot of sequence involving the villains is lame. However the movie still has some merits. The scenes among Robin and his men are the best, especially when the Arab played by Morgan Freeman helps a woman in labor give birth. Michael Kamen's score is grand and exhilarating and is still widely used. ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"" is a curious little blunder. A movie with good intentions that doesn't quite make the mark but still has some stuff to deliver that helps it pull through.",1103932800,,2313,4.699507389162561

However, I was disappointed with both.  While the added scenes do give some interesting background to the sheriff, they seem forced and in my opinion take away from the main focus of the movie and don't seem necessary.  Also, the sheriff has his scribe's tongue cut out in one of the added scenes, but a scene near the end, which was in the original version, has the same scribe speaking clearly.  I was also extremely disappointed with the picture quality.  It appeared grainy and often had theater pops and crackles. It definitely did not seem like the ""all-new digital transfer"" mentioned on the packaging.  Having not seen the original DVD version, I don't know if its picture quality is any better, but either way I think they could have cleaned this up a little better.

Among the new added scenes are ones where the sheriff cuts out the tongue of his scribe and which show the now mute scribe writing all of his communications since he can no longer speak. However this 'special edition' then leaves in an original scene at the film's end where the scribe verbally tells Robin and Azeem where to find the sheriff (!) And even more frustrating is than NONE of the six commentators on the two commentary tracks bother to mention this.  It's so sloppy and inconsistent, I wish they had just left the film alone. If the filmmakers want audiences to see extra footage, but that footage is no longer consistent with the movie, they should put it in a ""Deleted Scenes"" section. Not incorporate it back into the movie. And the fact that director Kevin Reynolds says nothing about this flaw shows just how little he cared about his film. And as for the commentaries, there are HUGE gaps where nothing is said at all (in fact, at a few points, I thought my commentary track wasn't working it was so bad) and when they DO speak it's to say such pearls of wisdom as ""Nice shot"" ""I still have that sword"" and ""Whoa"" between the long gaps of silence.

Soon they escape but without the loss of one life and the salvation of another. Robin, along with Morgan Freedman, as his companion, find their way back to England where Robin finds that the King, away on the Crusade, is in danger of losing his crown to the Sheriff of Nottingham.

The cinematography of the countryside and castles of England are well worth this DVD as the movie showcases the beauty of the forests and landscape of England. The costumes and sword fighting are also highlights that should not be overlooked.

This DVD is special in that it is the extended version of the theatrical released movie so there are a couple of added scenes. One to note is the scene when the witch Mortania explains to the Sheriff about his real mother.

Every aspect of the movie has to be given top marks, and on this special edition of the movie, you get 12 minutes of extra footage that wasn't shown originally in cinemas.
However, the rest of the extras are not very good. I don't see the point in bringing out films that did great business when they originally came out, but don't give much extra on the DVD! The only decent extra on this is Bryan Adam's live performance at Slane Castle in Dublin of ""Everything I Do (I Do It For You)"". You've got a ""behind the scenes"" feature - presented strangely enough by Pierce Brosnan (why?) playing Jeff Goldblum. (The resemblance is uncanny). And then there are ""vintage"" cast interviews, which I can't stand on DVD extras - they are so dull & tedious! And a photo gallery, you can't forget that.
The 12 minutes not shown in cinemas is quite cool. But you have to watch closely, because sometimes, it's little more than extra shots of people in the crowd or whatever. What is quite good, is the longer sections of cut film is to do with the Sheriff of Nottingham, and these scenes give an insight into his relationship with the witch. Very interesting, and so stupid that it was cut from the original version of the film.
There's a great cameo from Sean Connery towards the end (why did I think Patrick Stewart was going to walk out?), which he reportedly got paid $250,000 for, for TWO DAYS work (alright for some) which he donated to charity.
For all the ladies out there - the scene where Kevin Costner is naked under the waterfall, is actually a body double!!! Which is kinda weird, have you seen the tan lines?!

Azeem (Morgan Freeman) is a constructive element of expansion of the tale to a broader world-wide perspective (albeit anachronistically trite at times).  Strong and spunky Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a more real and believable character than in her traditional damsel-in-distress function.  The real gem here, though, is Alan Rickman's and the screenwriter's interpretation of the Sheriff of Nottingham as a tragic-comic villain.  It is worth purchasing the movie just for that.

They are not that good; they break up the narrative almost to detrimental effects and often times lead to confusion. For example; a man, mid-way through the movie has his tongue cut out, the next few times we see him he cannot talk, in one of the last scenes he speaks (the scene where he speaks at the end is in the original and the other scenes were added). This made the experience kind of sour for me. Also with an expanded edition I was hoping for letter-box, but alas, I was disappointed again (yet, I admit this is my own fault for not checking first).
The added features are all right, but not spectacular-- two separate feature length commentaries which aren't very interesting and a network behind-the-scenes program hosted by Pierce Brosnon; nice but I was expecting more.

Saddled with the task of watching over his kingdom while the King is at war, he defends the land from impetulant son of a Satan-worshiper. This thief is named Robin and slimes his way into forming alliances with several peasants and a noblewoman.
A few spoilers follow
Unless you were really, really concentrating on the movie or had no foreknowledge of the tale of Robin Hood, this could pass as a servicable summary. Let me get something straight, right off the bat: I love Robin Hood. I've probably read every version from the Great Illustrated Classics to the original. So, I'm probably being more biased than necessary.
So, first, what's wrong? I'll give you a hint. It begins with a ""K"" and ends with ""evin Costner"". Don't get me wrong I like-- okay, ""Dances with Wolves"" was good. Everything else of his was rot (except maybe ""Field of Dreams"", which I keep meaning to see). Like Tom Cruise, he plays the same character in every movie. Some scenes -- like the ones with Will Scarlett -- he handles adequately. Other, he botches. And let's not discuss his ""accent"".
Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Sadly, while he gives his character a great presence, the writers don't give him much to do except make a point of not fighting and drinking.
Plot-wise, this film is lacking. Some parts make little sense (Robin's conversation with the evil priest, etc.). Others are too drawn out (the attack on the Nottingham fort). Some parts don't segue. As for the ending... ah, I'll get to that after I review:
What's GOOD
Alan. Rickman. Seething malice, practically spitting every word, maniacal and deliciously unpredictable, Rickman is the perfect villain (as proved in many of his other films). His character is (insanely) more likable than Robin! Robin is portrayed as being a whining little rich bully who has an awakening and tries to set things right. In the process, he upsets most fo the villagers' lives. The Sherriff is witty (""Locksley! I'll cut your heart out with a spoon!!), smart, and dangerous. I was rooting for him!
The biggest injustice in the film happens at the climax of the film, where Robin and the Sherriff face off. I will warn you, this is a spoiler, but not really if you have any sense of drama.
*SPOILER BEGINS*
ROBIN CHEATS! In no way would Locksley have won, were it not for Marion's interference. He was an incapable swordsman who got thoroughly owned and would've died twice if Marion hadn't kicked Nottingham and thrown the couch at him. And he used a hidden weapon, something no hero would do.
*SPOILER ENDS*
Now, I enjoyed the cameos. Everyone knows Sean Connery plays Richard the Lionhearted in a small scene and yes, it's nice to see, but my favorite was Robin's father, played by Brian Blessed. Who's Brian Blessed? Why, he played Richard the IV (this movie's Richard's successor) in Rowan Atkinson's ""Black Adder"". A very nice surprise, even if he only had a short scene.
Overall, this movie is average, typical Hoolywood fare. Rickman's performance is worth sitting through Costner's tepid acting five times over. A few decent action scenes, some humor, some tripe. If you're looking for a decent Robin Hood, try any of the other ones. The 1938 version is great, the Disney version ais more than acceptable ... I even prefered Mel Brooks's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" to this. You have Cary Elwes who, despite being in a parody, is the perfect choice for Robin, and Dave Chapelle who is always hilarious. And heck, even the TV Movie ""Princess of Thieves"" has the succulent Keira Knightley (Rrrrreeaaaaagle! *a la Wayne Campbell*).",1073001600,2,3640,4.807017543859649
440070,5,6302206294,"Granted this movie wasn't the best keystone in the Robin Hood mythos, but it has style and class.  For those people out there who have a problem with the costumes... are y'all forgetting the movie is set back in MEDIEVAL times?  The costumes reflect the depravity of that era and are pretty realistic in my opinion, would you rather a modern medieval tale with cross-dressing weirdos in tights and elf shoes? How homoerotic.
  As for the acting, I find it pretty accurate for the roles portrayed --poor, ignorent farmers-- they aren't supposed to sound like they've just graduated magna cum laude from Oxford. Costner does wonderfully as the hero as does the rest of the cast, and Alan Rickman is marvelous as the Sheriff of Nottingham.
  And the stuff about Costner's accent (or lack thereof), come on, if that detracted too much from the movie, you watch movies too seriously!  The lack of any good authentic accents doesn't add to the continuity or the mythos as a whole, but for this movie, accents don't detract horribly from it.
  For those who compare this to the Earl Flynn version (think coloful Peter Pan) reffer to the paragraph about ""homoeroticism.""
  Overall, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves isn't the most Oscar Worthy movie of the 90's but it certainly isn't the worst either, and in fact is more fun than most; it definitely is worth your attention and ffits well in the modern day too. I personally love this movie, however, it deservers 4.5 stars instead of the full 5 just based on the fact that Kevin Costner appears naked briefly.",1069200000,,1550,4.746268656716418
440071,2,6302206294,"I recently saw this on DVD for the first time since in the theatre in '91. I thought it was mostly OK then, and that the brouhaha about Costner's accent was dumb -- it's not that important (the rest of the cast has varying degrees of English, fake English and American accents).
However, seeing again confirms that it hasn't aged very well. It's a pretty lame effort by the standards of other action/adventure type films based on classics (Three Musketeers '73 or '93, Conan the Barbarian, Scarlett Pimpernel, Count of Monte Crisco etc.). Kevin Costner is a capable enough actor in contemporary roles but he's really weak at this kind of period part. It's not his accent, it's that he behaves in too modern a way. The script, which is not respectful of either the 12th century OR the classic story, adds insult to injury.
The character of Azeem seems to have been added purely for urban audiences -- he's woefully out of place and time and has no real function in the Robin Hood tale. Morgan Freeman is a fine actor and one can easily imagine a good original film built around the appealing character of Azeem, but it was very poor writing to put him in this movie. It muddles thingsmore than they already are.
A lot of people seem tolike Alan Rickman's performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham, but to me this was classic overacting and scene chewing. Mr. Rickman is capable of vastly better work than this, so I guess I have to blame the script and director for making the ""bad guy"" so cartoony. If there is no good villain, a story with a hero becomes unbalanced -- how can you fight evil, when evil is jokey and non-threatening? Michael Wincott does better as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, treating the part more seriously and with real menace, but he exists in the plotline here only to be repeatedly humiliated by Robin Hood and is killed off so early his character never is full developed.
Mary Ellen Mastrantonio wasn't a very good choice for Maid Marian -- beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course, but I found her gaunt and plain looking, and she had no chemistry with Kevin Costner at all. (Neither was the concept of her as a plucky swordswoman developed.) She actually seems to have more chemistry with Rickman, (even if it is the ""I hate you"" kind) so you don't have any kind of romantic flow at the end when Robin Hood and Maid Marian finally marry.
Costumes and sets seem both drab and inaccurate, a remarkable (under) achievement. Since Robin Hood is more a myth and fantasy/parable, rather than a history lesson, I think it would have been more enjoyable if the costumes were colorful and romantic, rather than drab and ragged. At any rate, it's not a movie that one gets a lot of visceral enjoyment just from watching the sets and costumes.
Since almost 15 years have gone by, I think someone could seriously think about remaking another version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with better actors, script, etc. There have been lots of versions over the years -- good, bad and indifferent -- but this is DEFINITELY not the definitive version.",1067990400,5,3060,4.595978062157221
440072,1,6302206294,"I remember when ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES came out, I had extremely high hopes for it. The promotional stills and interviews looked promising, and I was expecting a high-spirited romp on par with Errol Flynn's celebrated film. Boy, was I in for a letdown.
The movie started off thrillingly, with Michael Kamen's spectacular score playing over medieval illustrations. But as soon as the opening credits ended, the film showed its true colors...a dark, dank, gore-laden bore. Seriously, what Robin Hood movie worth its salt starts with a dismemberment scene? I couldn't even look at the screen for this sequence. Alas, it was only the beginning. We're later treated to a close-up of Robin slitting his hand open (and blood seeping thru his fingers) to swear revenge for his father, we see Will Scarlett take an arrow thru the hand, we see the Sheriff of Nottingham's witch slice her arm open and spit into her blood to make a prediction, we see a blood-filled egg cracked open in another scene, we see the Sheriff's face getting stitched up...really, how's a guy supposed to keep his popcorn down? How did this movie get away with a PG-13 rating? This is R-level stuff all the way. Of course, the movie's lack of color and light doesn't help much. I don't mind them foregoing the tights for this go-round, but why isn't Robin Hood wearing his signature Lincoln green? Why isn't Will Scarlett at least wearing SOMETHING red? Everybody's wearing browns and blacks, which makes the film monochromatic and dull. Sherwood Forest looks dirty and gloomy instead of inviting and exciting. The sets are so dark and shadowy that it's a miracle anyone can see where they're going. I'm sure John Graysmark and John Bloomfield did their best with the sets and costumes, but they would have been better served had they been colorful and well-lit. And the plot takes too much of the spirit out of the legend. Robin's such a sullen gloomy Gus that it's impossible to imagine the Merry Men taking him in, much less letting him lead them. Friar Tuck's reduced to a potbellied wimp (what happened to the swordsman who was more lethal than he looked?). Azeem, while a good character in his own right, really doesn't belong in the Robin Hood mythos. (He would have made a fine stand-alone character, though.) The witch has no business being in this film at all. And what purpose does it serve to make Will Scarlett Robin's traitorous half-brother? Director Kevin Reynolds tries to guide the movie with a swift and steady hand, but the film is such a dismal mess that he ultimately can't hold it together. It's so ponderous and serious that there's no sense of fun to be had. And hearing Kamen's glorious score accompanying the film makes the experience even worse. That music deserved to be in a much better movie, and it possesses the fun, exciting spirit that the movie itself utterly lacks.
And then there's the acting. You couldn't find a better Sheriff of Nottingham than Alan Rickman, and he literally steals the show. But that's not too hard when everyone else stinks. Morgan Freeman does his best with Azeem, but again, this character doesn't belong in the saga. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio doesn't have any spark as Marian, nor is she really beautiful enough to play the part. (Olivia DeHavilland she ain't.) Christian Slater can't make heads or tails of the tarnished Will. Brian Blessed is wasted as Robin's doomed dad, as is Michael Wincott as Guy of Gisbourne. Sean Connery's cameo as King Richard is fun, but pointless. The supporting players are so dull they aren't even worth mentioning. And Kevin Costner...great actor, but a LOUSY Robin Hood. He has neither the presence or the attitude this character requires, and he's always talking in a droning monotone. In no way does he come off as an inspiring leader; he's more apt to put you to sleep. Nor does he have the physicality the role demands. I haven't seen a Robin Hood this inept since Barrie Ingham in A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD. Yeah, Costner gets in a few good shots with an arrow, but when Robin thoroughly sucks at swordplay and can't even take the Sheriff without help from Azeem, you know the filmmakers have screwed up. Robin Hood's supposed to be the last dude on the planet you want to mess with, not a graceless klutz. Errol Flynn would have trashed the Sheriff and his witch with both hands tied behind his back. Heck, even Cary Elwes' MEN IN TIGHTS incarnation and Disney's cartoon fox Robin would have made short work of them. This Robin...well, had he been killed at the end of the movie, I doubt anyone would have really cared. He's hardly the sort of guy you want to root for.
Call me old-fashioned, but I don't like my swashbuckler epics to be gory, dark, and dismal exercises in tedium. I like them bright, colorful, exuberant, and fun...with a minimum of bloodletting. THE MASK OF ZORRO is a case in point, as are THE PRINCESS BRIDE, LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Compared to those films, PRINCE OF THIEVES falls horribly short. Compared to the Errol Flynn classic it so wants to topple, it's an even bigger failure. Maybe some day there'll be a good, modern Robin Hood movie that measures up to the Flynn version and truly revives the legend for a new generation. But for now, this film ain't it. Stick with the Flynn version.",1066608000,7,5319,4.726587728740581

440074,4,6302206294,"This film is a `90s version of the classic Robin Hood story, with Kevin Costner starring as the good-guy thief. Costner is joined in his efforts against the murdering Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Richman) who once again proves why he makes an excellent villain. Richman  won best supporting actor in the British Academy Awards for his excellent roll.
Along with Morgan Freeman who plays a philosophizing side kick Azeem, and by Nick Brimble, who plays Little John (anything but little). After Robin barely survives a watery skirmish with Little John, the two become allies and Robin joins forces with Little John's band of robber thieves to overcome the evils of the Nottingham sheriff.

440076,4,6302206294,"Some movies are intended as entertainment only, and ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" certainly fills that bill. It's a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-style adventure movie, which means it has an old-school attitude toward physical stunts and special effects. It was made back before digital effects started replacing actors and sets, and today, in its wonderful new DVD incarnation, feels like a breath of fresh air. This isn't ""Godfather II,"" but man, I love this movie.
People gripe about Costner's accent, or lack thereof. Get over it. He's a movie star here, coming off ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Field of Dreams."" Robert De Niro might have done a wonderful British accent; he also probably would have wrecked the movie far worse than Costner is accused of doing. What this movie needed was a likable, positive, magnetic star in the lead role. Costner had the goods then, and I think he still does.
In addition to Morgan Freeman and the luminous Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (whatever happened to her?), this version of ""Robin Hood"" has Alan Rickman, who's just a hoot as the Sheriff of Nottingham. I am willing to forgive his anachronistic behavior because he elevates the movie to another level of escapism, providing great fun and humor just when things might be getting a little too uppity with Costner's Robin of Locksley. Together, Costner and Rickman provide a contrast in showmanship that's just plain enjoyable to watch.
The action sequences are well-staged, energetic, quick, brutal, and (again) fun. And the production design is excellent -- grubby without looking cheap. A great-looking movie on the big screen that holds up well after all these years.
I'm pleased with the new 2-disc DVD. I bought it essentially for the commentary with Costner and director Reynolds; their remarks are almost as entertaining as the film itself. (I've listened to Costner on quite a few commentary tracks, and he's loose and candid, not just about his own work, but the Hollywood system in general. Wish he'd lay down one for a new ""Waterworld"" disc.)
My only complaint about the DVD is that the sound quality is sorely lacking; the dialogue tracks are muted and muddled, while the music drowns out everything else.
Is ""Robin Hood"" perfect? Nope. But you gotta accept each movie on its own terms, and for what it is, ""Robin Hood"" still rocks.",1064707200,2,2334,4.956632653061225
440077,4,6302206294,"Robin Hood has been filmed many times and this is a very ambitious attempt to give the story new dimensions, coupled with wonderful sceneries and lots of eye candy for everyone. Handsome men, beautiful Marian (Mastrantonio), huge, impressive castles, deep woods, fighting, loving, humour... And poor Kevin Costner, who is very cute and sympathetic - but uncomfortable with his part.
The story is familiar to us all, in this film it has an interesting addition with Robin as a prisoner during the crusades and his return to England with Azeem, the Great one, who must save his life to pay a debt. Although he likes to choose his moment... Morgan Freeman is very impressive as Azeem and gets some of the best lines, like when talking about mistletoe: ""In my country we don't drug women with plants. We talk to them."" The manuscript has in fact many good lines - but Costner seems to drop all the opportunities of making himself memorable, when the sidekicks are having the time of their lives. Even fat friar Tuck seems to have more presence than the star of the movie.
This really isn't a bad movie, that's why I've given it four stars, although the third star goes to Freeman and the fourth to Rickman (the Sheriff on Nottingham). It's entertaining and has comedy and suspense and it's a feast for the eyes, but still it is a bit of a disappointment. Anyone who's done any acting or plans to act some day: this is how you let others steal the scenes even though they don't mean to. The film has two opposite examples of the use of energy and presence. Costner slouches through the film with so little energy that he actually lets everyone else shine at his own expense. Only with Mastrantonio or with the bow and arrow there is some charisma. On the other end there's Rickman's sheriff, bursting with energy right down to his fingers, every movement and raising of the eyebrows full of meaning. It's no wonder much of his work was cut off. Even in this version, he completely throws off the balance of the movie so that the audience waits for the sheriff's scenes, not Robin's. And which are the lines everyone remembers after the movie? ""And call of Christmas!"" ""I'll cut your heart out with a spoon!"" All sheriff's work, of course. Somewhere it was said, that Rickman has a conspiracy with the audience, as if saying: ""Let's have fun with this, so we can move on to doing something worth while after that."" I thought it was very well put - and he certainly has a lot of fun. If you miss seeing more of him, get the new DVD, it's supposed to have some of scenes that were cut out, when the producers saw, what was happening to Costner - getting seriously shadowed by the villain.
Mastrantonio is a very beautiful Marian and works well with Costner, but doesn't seem to know, whether to fear or hate or loath the sheriff, so she does neither very convincingly. Although it must be difficult with sheriff's purring voice in one's ear...
It is a real pity, that much of good work done by other actors in smaller parts suffers from Costner's lack of interest in the movie, as it seems. But if you don't mind it, there's a lot of entertaining things to see and good performances - and several good lines, which make you think the writers had fun.",1062979200,,3242,4.543589743589743
440078,3,6302206294,"There is an old saying that ""crime does not pay "" but I suggest that actors can be excluded from this, since a great many have made a good living by playing the bad guy .One such is Alan Rickman and his extra - ordinary performance  as the Sheriff of Nottingham is by far the best thing in this retread of the Robin Hood legend. His camp ,flambouyant and arch performance owes much to the English pantomime tradition of the hissable villain ,and he seems to be playing to the gallery and enjoying himself enormously without quite descending to parody.  He rules the roost in  dank and dingy Nottingham castle with the aid of his pet sorceress ,nicely played by Geraldine McEwan.
Set alongside Rickman ,Kevin Costner comes over as  bland and anodyne and is no match for past luminaries like Flynn ,Connery and Fairbanks who have tackled the role with elan and distinction. The interpretation is too heroic , clean cut and  self righteousness ,to ever really impose itself on the movie.
The familiar story is given a new airing  with Robin returning from the Crusades to discover his lands appropriated ;his father dead at the hands of the sheriffs men and the poor groaning under the weight of taxes. And to top all this his beloved Maid Marion is about to tie the knot with the sheriff. Robin -with Saracen friend Azeem in tow -joins up with a band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest to challenge the  ruling tyranny. New ingredients for the early nineties audience include sorcery ,flip dialogue and some psychological perspectives but essentially its the old tale retold
The action set pieces are well done and there are enough scenes of swordplay and archery to satisfy most
 viewers but it needs tighter  editing and better pacing to grip consistently.
Freeman is excellent as Azeem and Mastrantonio make a spirited early feminist Marion
Its an enjoyable movie but I mark it down for the colourless performance of Costner -who is not a bad actor but is simply miscast-and the excessive running time",1061510400,,1997,4.7485549132947975

440110,4,6302206294,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has long been one of my favorite movies.  As a child there was something about the story and the movie that just sucked me right in.  Watching it ten years later, it still holds up and I still love the movie.  This is yet another retelling of the Robin Hood legend, and in many ways, it stays true to the legend of an outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, fights the evil sheriff of Nottingham and tries to save the Maid Marian.  This version feels more realistic.  There is no prancing and the men do not wear tights (naturally, this spawned a wonderful spoof by Mel Brooks, but that is another point all together).
The movie opens in a Jerusalem prison.  Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) is a prisoner, along with his friend Peter DuBois.  To protect Peter, Robin tries to take Peter's place at being punished.  Robin also uses this as an opportunity for escape.  He is able to overpower the guards and escape with Peter.  Robin attempts to free other countrymen but is only able to free a moor, Azeem (Morgan Freeman).  They make it out, but Peter is killed during the escape.  Peter makes Robin promise to protect his sister, Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).
Arriving in England, Robin meets Guy of Gisborne (Michael Wincott), the Sheriff's cousin.  Robin defends a young boy who is being assaulted for poaching deer.  It is because of his actions here that Robin will come to the attention of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman).  Robin returns home to find that his father has been murdered and his home destroyed.  He vows to avenge his father.  Robin and Azeem now travel to the house of DuBois to meet Marian.  After Robin proves his identity and talks with Marian he is chased to Sherwood Forest by Guy and his men.
It is when Robin arrives in Sherwood and joins up with John Little (Nick Brimble) and the other outlaws that the heart of the movie begins.  Seeing the conditions that the outlaws were living in, Robin decides to start fighting back.  He steals some food (and the sheriff's horse) as well as cutting the Sheriff across the cheek with his knife.  This begins the mini-war between Robin and the Sheriff.  He organizes the woodsmen into a community and trains them.  The sheriff is continuing to raise the reward for Robin's capture, but the peasants love Robin more and more for all that he does for them.  Robin is also robbing the rich noblemen who are passing through Sherwood.  These noblemen are carrying bribes from the Sheriff to lead a revolt against the absent King Richard (he is off fighting the crusades).
The movie eventually ends with a showdown between Robin and the Sheriff and finally ends with one of the greatest cameos of all time when King Richard returns.  Mixed into this movie is quite a bit of action, and a well done love story between Robin and Marian.  The acting of Costner is not the best you'll ever see, but the movie rises above this (and Costner's lack of an English accent).  Kevin Costner is a serviceable Robin Hood and he comes across as believable and likable.  The rest of the cast is probably what makes the movie work, though.  Everyone is spot on.  Alan Rickman plays a perfectly evil Sheriff and he is the highlight of the movie, stealing every scene he is in.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful and warm as Marian and it is easy to see why Robin would have fallen in love with her.  The only reason this movie did not propel her into being a huge movie star was simply that she didn't want to be one.  The rest of the cast is perfect (Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater being the other two ""name"" actors) and really help to set the mood and feel of the movie.  This may have been a summertime epic fantasy, but the movie is a lot of fun and holds up surprisingly well over the years and it remains one of my favorite movies.
I should also mention the spectacular soundtrack/score for this movie.  The Robin Hood theme is one of the most memorable themes i've heard and it remains one of my favorites.  The music helps to make the movie.
This review was of the special edition DVD.  There are additional and extended scenes that were put back into the movie.  Most of the scenes expand the relationship of the Sheriff and his witch Mortianna.

440111,5,6302206294,"Over the years, it seems that the Robin Hood saga has been a favorite of sorts for film makers to re-invent, manipulate, and showcase again and again.  No doubt due to global appeal and the premise of a hero taking from the rich, giving to the poor, and fighting the good fight.
Of all the Robin Hood films ever produced, it's readily apparent that Prince of Thieves relies less on genuine historical accuracy and leans more toward Hollywood flair which still makes for an entertaining film.  Despite using no English accent (which appears to grate on some reviewers for some reason), Kevin Costner presents himself well in the role of Robin Hood.  Coupled with fine performances from Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, Christian Slater, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, (to name just a few), the story moves at an exciting pace and hits the mark as a stand up adventure movie that doesn't disappoint.
As for the new 2 disc special edition release of this movie, it just got a whole lot better.  Not having to flip the disc over any more to see the entire feature like in the first release, you now have a new digital transfer and a remastered DTS 5.1 soundtrack and both are outstanding.  On disc 2 you have great bonus material enhancing the value and enjoyment even further.  Included is a decent documentary on the making of Prince of Thieves, Bryan Adams performing his music video of '(Everything I do) I do it for you', an interactive mediaeval weapons gallery, cast and crew bios, production notes, interviews with cast and crew, and trailers and t.v. spots.
You don't really have to be a die-hard Robin Hood fan to enjoy this movie.

I've heard people make fun of Kevin Costner's accent but hey, nobody's perfect. Besides that doesn't even have an affect on the movie. The charaters are great and well performed. Everyone did a very convincing job on their roles. I really liked Marion, because she not only portrayed a damsel in distress but she also was a very strong willed woman who didn't scare too easily. I loved Azeem, I don't think the movie would have been the same without him. Morgan Freeman is just great in whatever movie he acts in and of course this is no exception. I forgot to mention, Christian Slater has a part in this movie that itself is a good reason to watch the movie. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Will Scarlett (Christian Slater) is sent to [do away with] Robin and then he tells Robin why he hates him so much. I at least thought that was a very impacting part in the movie not only for the viewer but also for Robin.
Compared to the movies that are coming out now with the same rating I would say the sexual content in this movie is minor. If anything, the violence is a little extreme, lots of blood and arrows going through people's heads so parents should watch this movie before they allow thier kids to watch it. I remember the first time I watched this movie I was in seventh grade and we watched it during history class. Nobody fast forwarded through any of the movie so I guess it depends on how strict parents are on letting their kids watch violent movies. I've loved this movie ever since the first time I watched it and now own the dvd which is just as good. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is like me and like watching movies that are full of action and adventure. Oh and of course good looking talented actors!",1052352000,5,1898,4.349295774647888
440114,3,6302206294,"*SYNOPSIS* - After being captured by Turks during the Crusades, Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) escapes and returns to England. Traveling with Robin is Azeem (Morgan Freeman), a Moor who vows to repay a life debt to Robin. But as soon as he returns home, Robin discovers that a lot can change during four long years. The Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) has murdered Robin's father and now has a tyrannical rule over the people during King Richard's absence. The Sheriff also has the evil witch Mortianna (Geraldine McEwan) on his side as he launches a campaign to put himself on the throne. Robin unites a band of exiled villagers to lead them against the Sheriff and his evil cousin, Guy of Gisborne (Michael Wincott). But with only a band of thieves and their families, can Robin be able to rid the land of evil and protect his true love, Marion Dubois (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)?
*ACTING* - Kevin Costner as Robin Hood is my favorite character in the whole movie (despite complaints about his accent ;). His character was charming, funny, and was overall a great hero to root for. In the beginning he is obviously still a young man, a bit wild and not that serious. This part of Kevin Costner's acting has a lot to wish for (especially the scene where he arrives back in England). But later on as Robin begins to mature more with his responsibilities of being a leader, we see the glimpses of Costner's terrific dramatic acting abilities. Morgan Freeman gives a lot of dignity to his character of Azeem as throughout the movie he gives pieces of advise and wisdom to Robin. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marion Dubois is well acted and she puts a good balance of strength and womanly characteristics in her acting. And then we have the Sheriff of Nottingham played by Alan Rickman. Though as an actor he is excellent, I absolutely did not like the characterization of the Sheriff! I can understand that they wanted to make the Sheriff as terrible and evil as possible, but I think in this movie they went a bit too far. Making him constantly shift between comical to serious resulted in only giving the movie an uneven feel. And there's one scene between the Sheriff and Marion that was highly unnecessary. Also look for Sean Connery as the good King Richard at the end of the movie. Nobody can play royalty the way Sean Connery can; he just has this way of making his characters come alive! I wish he had a bigger part in the movie.

*PLOT* - The story of Robin Hood is generally well-known and as all movies go with famous legendary heroes, some changes are made to make the movie as interesting as possible. Overall I had only a few complaints with the plot: 1) I am extremely puzzled about where Prince John is throughout the movie! 2) As I said before, I was disgusted with the character of the Sheriff. 3) The character of Will Scarlet is very different and I missed the original character (my favorite in the book). The humor in the movie is distributed frequently and as often as possible. In one sense this reason is why I like the movie. But some of the humor doesn't seem to fit in with surrounding events or seriousness of the scenes, making the movie at times uneven.
*ACTION & SUSPENSE* - I must say that the action is one of the best points about this movie! I can almost guarantee that after watching this movie, everyone will have a favorite 'action scene'. There's the scene where Robin Hood and his men are attacked in the forest, Robin Hood's fight with Little John at the river, and ultimately, the last 20 or so minutes is extremely exciting and suspenseful! And most of all, Kevin Costner is very, very cool whenever he wields his bow and shoots off his arrows! The sword fighting of course is pretty spectacular.
*PG-13 RATING* - ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is rated PG-13 for some sexual content, action/violence, and some language. The profanity is pretty tame compared to recent films but it's still there. The action and violence in the movie is not that graphic or gory but still not recommended watching with younger kids. But what really put me off was the sexual content. Some of the innuendo might have been tolerable but as I have already mentioned, the Sheriff is very weird and strange. I recommend parents watch the movie before watching with younger children.
*PUT-IT-ALL-TOGETHER* - Overall, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is an enjoyable film which has its flaws. This movie goes under my list of ""Movies which had potential"". ""Robin Hood"" would have been a much better film for me if lots of the sexual content would have been taken out. If you're a Kevin Costner film you shouldn't pass by this movie. If not a Costner fan... well, it's up to you if you want to watch this movie. But if you're looking for a good action and adventure film, check this out!

One thing that folks around here have neglected to mention is that Costner starts out the film with a light British accent, which he loses about 5 minutes into the film.  Costner probably refused to have a dialect coach.  Robin Hood is an English character, and it might have done Costner some good to actually challenge himself for a change.
In my opinion, Errol Flynn is still the definitive film Robin Hood.  Also, the British series 'Robin of Sherwood' is a marvellous version of the Robin Hood story, with much better acting than in this film.",1042329600,8,684,4.714285714285714

I bought Robin Hood, on DVD, about a month ago, and it was definately worth the money I paid for it. In my eyes, at least, Robin Hood will remain a classic.",1030752000,,686,4.051470588235294
440151,3,6302206294,"If one were rating the movie itself, this would probably be a ""4"". It's not a bad retelling of the myth, though it does drive the historian in me insane with its inaccuracies. It has heart and it has cool treehouses and the neatest archery effects this side of ""Lord of the Rings"" (though impossible ones at times). It starts with Robin in a Jerusalem jail and adds in a black Muslim with a warped sense of humor. It has a blind man in it who has more courage than most sighted folks. It has Maid Marian dressed like a ninja trying to kill Robin (where DOES all that courage and martial skill go when the Sheriff's trying to rape her?). Unfortunately, it has a medieval birthing scene, and I just can't forgive the producer this -- it didn't add anything to the movie, and just squicked me royally. And then there's the acting.. or one actor's acting, anyway. Kevin Costner's worse at showing emotion than Keanu Reeves. Everybody around him is showing sadness, joy, hate, and the best he can come up with is a totally monotonous, non-emotional, deadpan delivery of stilted lines like ""Did I offend you in a past life, Will Scarlett? What did I do to inspire such hatred?"", in the face of Christian Slater's overwhelming, beautifully portrayed anger and grief. I don't know who convinced Costner that this would be a great way to portray Robin, but whoever did it needs to be reprimanded.
It's still a decent movie. But the DVD edition of it is clearly a rushed affair. There are very few goodies on it, and it is two-sided for no particular reason that I could discern. It's widescreen, which is nice, but that two-sided thing is irritating as all get-out. At least on VHS it doesn't make me get up and switch tapes!

440155,5,6302206294,"Where this film succeeds is in the characters. The actors are all well-chosen for the leading and supporting roles. Nick Brimble is a gentle giant Little John, but is less thigh-slapping than earlier versions, and seems at times quite menacing. Micheal McShane is delightful as Friar Tuck and a variety of British and American character actors in lesser roles.
There are a couple of historical errors. The Merry men are seen to use the crossbow, the weapon of the French, whereas the English would have used the longbow. I cannot see why the film-makers could have got this wrong since almost every cinematic and televisual representation of the Outlaws shows longbows being used. The other big clanger is the location shooting, which has Robin and his chum (Morgan Freeman's inscrutable Azeem) walking the length of England in a couple of hours (from the White Cliffs of Dover to Hadrian's Wall). Again, this is baffling, when you see the care put into other areas of the film.
History aside, this is a great adventure, with Kevin Costner applying himself well in a difficult role, and the story of how Robin assembles his band being told with aplomb. There are well-choreographed fight sequences, superb villains in Alan Rickman and Geraldine McEwen, and a climactic ending. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the longest running U.K. Number One single, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) by Bryan Adams is taken from the soundtrack.",1013385600,,1438,4.921810699588478
440156,4,6302206294,"Robin of Locksley, imprisoned during the Crusades, returns home to find his father murdered, his family home destroyed, and his homeland in the grip of the ambitious and ruthless Sheriff of Nottingham. Teamed with Azeem the Moor, and a rough and tumble band of outcasts, Robin seeks to avenge his father and preserve the land for the return of King Richard.
Critics largely lambasted this film, but it's not bad, once you get past its flaws: Costner's non-existent accent; some historical and cultural inaccuracies; less than kind representations of  religious figures; and a certain disregard for both the original legend and the classic Errol Flynn film. One could quibble a bit about those things, but why? The producers of this film wanted to make a rough and rousing adventure, and they succeeded. Directed with verve and gusto by Kevin Reynolds, with solid supporting performances from many of Britain's finest (the always welcome Brian Blessed and Geraldine McEwan, for instance), the film overcomes its drawbacks with great action, a good sense of humor, and fun, old-fashioned romance.
The lead performances are all solid. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Marian is shrewd, tough, and vulnerable; a good heroine for the film, although her character becomes a bit too whiny during the climactic segments. Morgan Freeman is a real asset to the film, perfectly cast as Azeem, the Moor; he commands every scene he's in. There's also have a wild, wickedly funny performance by Alan Rickman as the Sheriff, who, when angered, demands that there be no more ""merciful beheadings"" and to ""call off Christmas!"" (Rumor has it that it was this performance that got him cast as Snape in the Harry Potter movie.) Costner's performance isn't going to win any awards, but he's good enough, giving the character of Robin both a certain cockiness and  winsome vulnerability.
There's humor to spare; some of the funniest moments come from Azeem's droll observations of English life and customs; at other times it's people's reactions to him. Reynolds isn't the world's greatest director, but he knows action, has a good sense of timing, and makes fine use of the scenic beauty of the English countryside. If--and this may be a big if for some--you can look past the film's flaws, it's a fun and entertaining two and a half hours.

The DVD has a poor mistake since the first side contains only 74 minutes of the movie and you have to flip the DVD to the other side to continue watching the film!

With such a big budget and excellence, I wonder why would the director make a mistake in presenting a wrong Muslim prayer! If you notice, when Morgan Freeman reaches England with Kevin Costner he starts praying after he asks about the East direction. But he prays not as how Muslims pray, which I find a big mistake!

440186,4,6302206294,"There's always a risk in filming historical persona and events.  For a variety of reasons,  Americans are particularly clumsy at this process.  The lack of long-term national traditions is  a major factor.  Another is the desire to be innovative.  Introducing new elements to a story is  mind-expanding, but almost forces historical flaws.  What we don't know we can fabricate.  If  it's done with the right actors and visual appeal, the accuracy can be overlooked.  This film is  a perfect example of a production that shreds historical accuracy and tradition, but gives us a  superb adventure story delivered within an excellent visual environment.
""Men in Tights"" was right - Costner doesn't sound British.  His effort in this film is certainly a  prime example of how Americans see the Middle Ages - stilted language, stiff delivery and  an exaggerated idealism.  Morgan Freeman doesn't sound terribly Arabic, nor are we given a  hint as to where his English language capabilities were obtained. Yet he adds so much to this production James Robinson must be congratulated for including him.  Alan Rickman, who nearly  walks away with this film, is perhaps the most convincing character.  With the possible  exception of Michael McShane, whose Friar Tuck is certainly a departure from traditional  portrayals, but which likely is the most accurate.
Given all this carping, Robin Hood is a fine film in its own right.  With the American  penchant for simplicity, the story becomes a contest between good and evil, period.  We're  able to overlook the issue of how the crusades nearly bankrupted England.  Tax collectors  don't win popularity contests anywhere.  Rickman is just the worst of a bad lot, and gives  Nottingham's character an aura of evil rarely encountered.  One can't help but wonder what  this film would have been like if he'd played Nottingham's boss, King John.  Certainly, it  might have made the surprise ending with Big Tam's [Sean Connery] cameo as Richard more  interesting.  In all events, this film is well worth the investment so long as you don't take it as  history.  It was a lucky investment for me, since i bought it in VHS.

The supporting roles, especially by Freeman, are superb and make up for Coster's sub par performance.
Now for why I gave this DVD 2 stars.  Everything about this DVD is atrocious.  First it is recorded on both sides with no identifiable marks to tell which side is A or B (there is in really TINY print on the center part of the disk an A and a B on the other side but you have to put it to your nose to see them)and there is no 5:1 surround or DTS to take advantage of the terrific sound effects in the movie.  Then there really isn't any good add ons for the movie except a somewhat shoddy but interesting historical background on Robin Hood.

440221,1,6302206294,"Kevin Costner is a thought actor. He works best alone, in close up, with his inner thoughts casting shapes and shadows on his face. This is why ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Field of Dreams"" were such successful films. Interacting with other actors he becomes at best mediocre. Put him in green stockings and get him to gallivant around Sherwood Forest speaking with a stupid English accent he hasn't broken in yet, and he looks like a complete dork. This film is also spoiled by its countless anachronisms. For example Moors were Arabs or Berbers, not so different from Southern Europeans. They definitely weren't African Americans.",975196800,7,629,5.0

My  rating of 4 however needs a little explanation.  I would give the film  itself a 5!, however the DVD deserves only a 3.  The film could not  possibly be any better, but perhaps becuase it was one of the first few  DVDs encoded - the art was not down to a science yet.  My biggest complaint  is that the DVD has to be flipped over halfway through the 2 hour movie.  However, some of the extra features are nice.  There is some background  information about the places and time of the film and some information  about the legend that it is based on.  But, these added features are just  glimpses into what they could have been had the DVD been released at a  later date when the technology.

It always seems to work. It is interesting. The  characters played their parts well. Except for Morgan Freeman. But he  couldn't help it because his role was innaccurate. Over all a really good  movie. I'm not a fan of rock and roll but I really like the theme  song,""Everything I do, I do It for you.""",966297600,,481,4.288888888888889
440224,5,6302206294,"""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is a rolicking adventure ride  that will please most people.  If ya can't get past the accents, then miss  out on a good movie.
Let me clear a few things up:
1.  ""Robin  Hood: Prince of Thieves"" was on a tight production schedule.  There  were three (count 'em, three) Robin Hood movies being produced at the same  time, and the one to come out finished first would be the one released in  theatres.  One production gave up and backed out.  That left two Robin Hood  movies - one with Kevin Costner, and one with Patrick Bergen.
2.  Because  of the tight schedule, Kevin Costner's accent was dropped to be  ""dubbed over"" in post production.  They simply didn't have the  time to worry about accents if they wanted to get the movie finished.
3.  Filming complete, the dubbing was dropped because of lack of time and the  movie was finished.  ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" was released  theatre-wide, whereas the Patrick Bergen version was slated for TV.
Now  that I have the little niggling thing about accents straightened up, get  passed it and watch the movie for what it was intended:  pure  entertainment.
There is plenty of humor - from Little John's river  fighting antics and his wife's bantering, to the Sheriff of Nottingham's  humorous frustrations (""why a spoon, cousin, why not an ax"" -  ""Because it's dull, you twit, it will hurt more!""), the viewer is  not disappointed.  The entire cast was enjoyable to watch, and the  costuming was superb.  The lush green of the forests (the movie was filmed  in the forests of Nottingham - which proved to be a problem - the airport  is nearby) is captured wonderfully on film, as well as the forest  ""homes"" Robin Hood and his Merry Men have taken refuge in.
I  rather enjoyed this movie because Kevin Costner's Robin Hood was a Robin  Hood for the 90's.  He was intelligent, witty, and funny, the way we  picture him to be.  Go ahead: rent the movie and lose yourself in a great  adventure flick.",965260800,108,1984,4.618497109826589
440225,5,6302206294,"In my opinion this movie was absolutly captivating.  When I first saw this movie Kevin Costner became my hero.  Ok, so his accent was a little off but, to a seven year old that never mattered.  I don't think they could  have found anyone else to fit the part because Costner became the perfect  hero and put in an astounding performance.  Alan Rickman also put in a  great performance with his accent.  He looked very much the part of the  Sherriff of Nottingham.  There have been many versions of Robin Hood but  this one seems like it could be the only one with any real comparison to  the real Robin Hood.  I say you simply must see this movie.  OUTSTANDING!",962582400,,661,4.4
440246,3,6302206294,"Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves is a good adventure film. Don't even tell me this is the definitive version;Errol Flynn's Robin Hood leaps leagues of flaming arrows better in almost every category. Robin held in prison for  five years and is still in perfect health! You've got to be kidding! Too  many scenes fall flat. Kostner is woefully upstaged by the British actors  with real accents;Kostner doen't even try so he seems not only wrong for  the role but set down by a time machine in the wrong age. The British  actors are excellent save Alan Rickman, who gets away with one of the  looniess performances in a major action film-he is a cartoon character  placed in the middle of realistic characters and his performance is so  hammy it is hard to root against him, for he is the biggest comedian in the  film. The action scenes are good, with Tarzan-like treehouses and swinging  vines and mercenary Celts (""They drink the blood of their dead,""  the Sherif complains to his witch soothsayer, who belongs in  ""Macbeth"" not in Nottingham Castle) The allure of adventure, the  pagentry, the romance is missing, all the admirable things toned down or  missing. Morgan Freeman is good but why in this movie-in a Sinbad movie  maybe but again the writers and director have mixed everything up like the  crazy stews the witch mixes up. And the wasted talent! Christian Slater  talks like a modern MTV hipster, Brain Blessed , a great English actor(What  I would have given had he been cast in the role of the Sherif of  Nottingham) is killed off for some unclear reason. Sean Connery, showing up  in comeo as the exiled King Richard, in a few spare minutes , has more male  magnetism than Kostner has in the entire film. Of course Connery played an  excellent Robin Hood in the excellent ""Robin and Marian."" I saw  this movie expecting so much and came away with so little. It is  fair  adventure film to add to your collection but it has torn the heart out of  the wonderful folk legend of Robin Hood and leaves a bad after taste. Buy  the Errol Flynn version, still the top version. Even the Walt Disney  version was not bad and a newer version with Patrick Bergin is also good. I  do like Michael Kamen's inspired film score. If only the rest of this mess  matched his lush music score and love theme.",960422400,3,2300,4.593596059113301
440247,5,6302206294,Kevin Costner IS Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves in the best adventure movie of 1991. I loved this movie. Sean Connery's cameo appearance as King Richard came as a terrific suprise to my mom and I. Rated PG in my mind.  Perfect for the entire family. Sean Connery and Kevin Costner  do it again.,959126400,,292,4.388888888888889
440248,1,6302206294,"Prince of Thieves -- hmmm, they borrow the Muslim Merry Man from Robin of Sherwood, and some of the magic and plot details. And they borrowed from some other sources. Of course ""borrowing"" is a long-standing  Hollywood tradition, and it would have been forgivable if Costner's Robin  Hood had even an ounce of charisma, or if the dialogue wasn't wincingly bad  (""Have I wronged you in a past life, Will Scarlet?"") or if the  direction of the film had been even. Big spectacle with little or no brains  behind it. I do like Little John (Nick Brimble) and his wife Fanny though.  However, for a really good Robin Hood film of 1991, I recommend ""Robin  Hood"" starring Patrick Bergin. And of course, you can always buy the  Errol Flynn  classic.",957916800,7,741,4.638461538461539
440249,3,6302206294,"This is a costume drama, plain and simple.  If you park your brain, this movie is a lot of fun.  Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, the movie abounds with historical inaccuracies--gunpowder?  Moors in England?--but  it's gorgeously filmed.  Kevin Costner is his usual deadpan self (and after  a while just abandons any attempts at a British accent), but it's Alan  Rickman's hilarious performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham that makes  this movie watchable.  Rickman was robbed of an Oscar nomination that  year--yes, he's that good.  A nice vegging-out-with-the-Haagen-Dazs movie,  and Costner looks pretty decent in tights as well . . .",957657600,2,643,5.32

440252,3,6302206294,"Kevin Costner is a fine actor but he should've never played Robin Hood. For starters he doesn't have an English Accent. It takes place in England not America! Also he put no real feeling behind the character of Robin  Hood. Robin Hood's motivation is trying to avenge his father's death. And  he does this by leading a bunch of Englishmen who lost their pride. How  convient for him as he entered Sherwood Forest. Also there's no  aspect of  time. How long did the Sherif and Robin Hood battle? Was it months, years,  days?  Also what's the story with the moor, cut that character out  completely, Morgan Freeman is also a great actor and did a fine job as the  moor. But the character was not needed for this film. Also on a historical  view, The Chinese invented gunpowder! I like Alan Rickman as the Sherif, he  really brought the character to a new level of being really evil and witty.  Also, get rid of the Witch Character, I would've been fine without her.  Anyway the movie was entertaining but I wouldn't buy it unless I saw it at  a great value.",951264000,,1055,4.455497382198953
440253,4,6302206294,"This movie was not exactly, what I was expecting, but on the whole I enjoyed it. There is just one little problem: It would have been a lot better without Costner. Now it is something like: The world's most boring  hero meets the world's most entertaining villain. Still, the support cast  (good acting by Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,  Christian Slater and a lot of others) saves the day, by producing a nice  movie around Costner's Robin Hood. I had expected a bit more of a  swashbuckler and a little less political commentary and Robin Hood from the  legend appears a rather more unconcerned fellow then Costner's stand alone  hero with deep socio-political involvement, but never mind. It looks great,  the action is up to standard and it even has a decent plot. As long as you  ignore little anachronisms (a telescope in the twelth century, Scots  dresses up like third century Picts) and forget about the ridiculous idea  of a witch in a Robin Hood legend (There is nothing else supernatural, just  a witch) it makes for an enjoyable evening in front of the TV.

Great a strong female  character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic  character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater?

Having the Moor sidekick is a bit much if you really think  about it, but insofar as the Christian world being portrayed as  anti-science, ignorant, backwards, etc., I have to disagree with the  reviewer from Chicago a few reviews back -- those were the *exact*  characteristics of the Christian church at that time, based on what I've  read. Hell, those are *still* the characteristics of many divisions of  Christianity. But in any case, I don't think Christianity is beign sh*t on  here -- the Friar Tuck only first appears as a ""worthless  drunkard,"" but eventually shows through as a very noble character.  Anyhow, this is a fine film, and pure escapism, so it's silly to nit-pick  details that don't gel with ""delicate sensibilities"" ... it's  just a fun, epic medieval adventure.",939427200,3,949,5.058064516129032

In the great process of the new DVD format for enjoying films that not only appear clearer and give you extra features  on which to choose, I am puzzled over Warner Brothers choice of doing  something that they have apparently not done on any of their other film  releases on DVD.  In ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES, the film has been split  to be included on BOTH sides of the disc.  This makes absolutely no sense  since it has been clear from the beginning, since DVD was first released,  that you could easily contain over 2 1/2 hours of content on a single side  including the extra features.
