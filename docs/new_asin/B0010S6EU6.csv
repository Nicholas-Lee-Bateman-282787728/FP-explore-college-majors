3049665,5,B0010S6EU6,I'm writing a review of this even before it comes out. Want to know why? Because it has to be amazing. There is no way on earth a product dedictaed to my favorite stooge could be bad. SHEMP SHEMP SHEMP!!!!!  pre - order it now. These are going to sell out. I predict 2008 is going to be the year of SHEMP,1199491200,14,304,3.903225806451613
3049666,5,B0010S6EU6,I had no idea he was as funny without the other Stooges untill I watched this dvd. What a performer!,1213315200,3,100,4.05
3049667,5,B0010S6EU6,"I LOVE the Stooges. They never fail to make me laugh, ever. This special salute to Shemp is amazing. The old films are something to be studied, if only for their historic film value. I have NEVER seen these earliest works of Shemps, and am thrilled to have them in my collection now.

Shemps was such a natural. He never seemed to be in character, so much as he WAS the character. He had a smooth approach to his roles that made him seem to glide through his scenes.

The bonus clips, with his family members, is worth it alone. The old photo's, and home movies are fantastic. And the stories are really sweet. Shemp seemed like he was one of the nicest guys in the world.

I love Curly, Moe and Larry too, but a tribute to Shemp is long overdue, and he is most deserving of it. Hopefully there will be more to come.

Any Stooge fan should own this, PERIOD!!",1208649600,3,858,4.245398773006135

BUT - and I rarely bother to write reviews here - I was greatly disappointed with the over-all quality of the films on this disc.  Granted, the first two selections on disc 1 are rare, Radio Pictures shorts, and they're choppy and not restored.  That I could forgive due the rarity of their availability, but the rest of the material was given no attention at all to clarity of picture- it was as bad in quality as they come.  Since most of it is available elsewhere in better condition, I expected that  Passport would have restored and refined the prints.  Alas, not to be.

3049669,1,B0010S6EU6,"A shame on you.  Another company out to make a quick buck on the popularity of THE THREE STOOGES.  The quality of this set is awful.  AFRICA SCREAMS, an Abbott and Costello comedy has been released over and over again since it is public domain as are the three STOOGES comedies that are part of this set.  They have been released and much better quality.  To add insult to injury this company thought it would be cute to add a horrible brownish tint to give the shows an ancient look.  All it does it make it even harder to watch.  Come on....colorized movies are bad or good depending on the individual.  But no need to give it a phony brownish look to make it look like an old tin type photo.  Other episodes are soft focus, poor sound and just an insult to a great comic who has so often been considered the ""forgotten Stooge"".  It ain't worth the money fans.",1206489600,40,862,4.298136645962733

Each brings a different spin to the Three Stooges but Shemp works, in his way, just as well. Both Curly and Shemp evoke laughs. Even Joe Besser had the chemistry, but came along too late. By his time, the series was a shadow of what it once was, so he was never shown to good advantage. Joe DeRita, in my opinion, just didn't have it in any way.",1206403200,5,455,4.181818181818182

Cartoons, old movies, The Stooges Collection Volume 1...I mean, most of the stuff coming out today has been restored and cleaned up and just looks and sounds amazing. Popping this DVD in over the weekend, I realized just how spoiled I have become. The quality of most of the video and sound transfers on this DVD look like they came off some bad reception UHF station from the 1980's via a rabbit ear antenna. Yes, I love Shemp. Yes, I love the Stooges. Is it great to have some of these movies and clips that I have never seen before? Absolutely. But, the 1980's style of poor video transfers made this kind of tough to watch. 5 stars if you are a completest and must have some of this rare hard to find Shemp material. But don't buy this DVD If you are not prepared to watch clips and shorts that look like they come off of an old VHS tape from the 1980's. I'll give it 4 stars just because I love Shemp so much.

3049672,4,B0010S6EU6,"Shemp Howard (Samuel Horowitz) was an original member of the comedic  vaudeville troupe known as (among other names) ""Ted Healy & his Southern Gentlemen,"" along with his brother Moe (Moses) and later Larry Fine (Louis Fienberg). In this early incarnation, Healy was the leader who slapped the others around. Eventually the trio split with Healy, Shemp went to Hollywood and his brother Curly (Jerome) joined with Moe and Larry to continue touring vaudeville as a trio.

Throughout the 1930s, Shemp had a considerable solo film career at Warner's, RKO, MGM, and Monogram. During this time he co-starred as Knobby Walsh in the Joe Palooka series. Later, at Universal, Shemp appeared in the comedy classics ""Buck Privates"" (Abbott & Costello) and ""The Bank Dick"" (WC Fields).

SHEMP COCKTAIL is comprised of features (""Africa Screams"" and ""Private Buckaroo"") and Three Stooges shorts that are all widely circulated public domain material. ""Henry the Ache,"" ""Knife of the Party"" and the excerpts of ""Convention Girl"" are much rarer and  thus of especial interest to collectors.

This twin-DVD set's manufacturer, PASSPORT VIDEO, has in the past superimposed a faint watermark on-screen at all times. Also, they've heavily filtered audio, much to the detriment of clarity. Whether these failings have been positively addressed in their new product remains to be seen.

When I first heard this was coming out, I was excited. I can't understand why it took me so long to order, though. The two-disc package is well-designed and was a terrific idea in theory, but in practice, the results were not entirely successful. Shemp's early work in several shorts are presented here, and much of it is of very dubious quality (poor audio, odd cropping, faded prints, etc.) While his earliest, solo work is notable, some of it here is so fleeting that he appears onscreen for only a few moments and is barely visible. The THREE Stooge shorts available here are entertaining and a good example of Shemp's work, but are pretty widely available in other STOOGE packages. The TWO BEST items though are a fair copy of the 1949 Abbott and Costello feature AFRICA SCREAMS - which features Shemp in several funny scenes - one with JOE BESSER! (Maybe we'll get a BESSER package some day too!) There is also an excellent full-length documentary on SHEMP that includes rare photos (of ALL THE STOOGE BROTHERS TOGETHER - what a TREAT!) plus family home movies, etc. Although Shemp's earlier works here can only be rated as decent in terms of quality and content, this package is worth owning for the A&C feature and the wonderful documentary REMEMBERING SHEMP, By the end, I felt that Shemp Howard was a man I would've not only like to have known, but had as a neighbor!

Nothing more, nothing less.

TRUE: Coulda/Woulda/Shoulda been restored, but this was a work of LOVE f-o-r Shemp-fans.
THAT said, the market-share would be the factor deciding HOW much money was available

Released in 2008, I paid coniderably MORE than what YOU will pay for it today (2013).

It's WORTH the price.

Just skip over the stuff you've got BETTER copies of, and watch the RARE stuff: enjoy!

Africa Screams with Abbott and Costello was outstanding as were the Three Stooges shorts, but the other content was greatly lacking in entertainment value. In my opinion it is a great addition to my Stooge collection because it highlights the accomplishments of Shemp, who is too often cast into Curly's shadow. The more I watch Shemp, the better I appreciate his genius. This is a good collection, but it needs to be approached with a proper focus, frame of mind.",1233187200,,626,5.147058823529412

The one original feature is the 45-minute documentary 'Remembering Shemp'.  It's interesting, but not very creative. It's composed almost entirely of three talking heads (Shemp's granddaughter, his daughter-in-law, and her sister), nothing too provocative.  Since it's not well edited, they end up talking about their own lives as much as Shemp's, so don't be fooled by the running time.

As a Shemp fan, I'd recommend this as a rental, tops, the only reason you might want to own it is to have all this stuff in one collecion.",1231286400,2,639,4.94392523364486
