8678372,4,B00NI4DQ6A,My 4-1/2 year old grandson loved this because it wasn't a cartoon and it challenged him to think what he would do. Also the kids in it are not actors so it was almost a children's game show. I would like to get more of these episodes.,1430524800,,234,4.0

8678377,2,B00NI4DQ6A,"***NOTE: I AM RATING THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM AND NOT THE FACT IT'S FOR A YOUNGER AGE GROUP (WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE DISSAPOINTED SOME)

This program, which began airing around 2010 in the UK, features 3 new non-actor children each episode (I am pretty sure they are not actors) who are guided by a sort of ghost of a 1920's type female character in the British Museum.  The goal is to complete three puzzles, each of which have a vision (clue), and find the Relic.  All this is done while defeating the Dark Lord and his forces who may grab the children or chase Agatha the guide.  If they complete all the challenges and gain the Relic, they are proclaimed Guardians of the Museum and awarded the Golden Scarab.  If they do not, they become relics themselves and are part of the exhibit.

HALF GAME SHOW, HALF THEATER:  This show has a sort of after school special, or program kind of feel and is fairly unpolished and modestly filmed.  The kids appear to be real contestants, but there is so much theater and staging around that it's hard to take seriously.  Obviously they are not going to be imprisoned in the British Museum if they actually fail in real life.  Anyway, the challenges are extremely simplistic and probably not worthy of the age of children involved.  This program won a Bafta ifs first year and continued its run through at least 2013 or 2014, so apparently it had some success.  Because it's centered in the museum, there is some cultural and historical exposure.  Nevertheless, I have a hard time seeing American children embracing this one.  It feels very amateur compared to contest shows for children airing on U.S. TV.  I bought it relatively cheep and I am still regretting it.",1417046400,7,1704,4.614617940199335
