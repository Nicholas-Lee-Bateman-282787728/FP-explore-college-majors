3977857,4,B002S0OB8W,This is a pretty enjoyable film I had pretty low ecpectations based on what some of the other reviews were saying about this movie. Sure its no oscar winner but if your looking for a fun slasher movie with a supernatural twist definitely check this one out.,1294012800,,257,4.48936170212766
3977858,1,B002S0OB8W,"Where to begin?  Right off:  This movie was awful.  I wanted it to be good as I am a major Wes Craven fan.  I especially like his early films from the late seventies and eighties.  However, this new outing from a true master of the horror genre is a familiar re-tread that even manages to cannibalize Craven's own earlier films.  There's another slasher with a ho-hum knife (Scream), there's the requisite teen-who-done-it element that's been boring and worn-out since the slew of Scream rip-offs that came out in the decade that followed its original release (yawn).  There's virtually no gore or effective violence (the kind of thing that Craven did incredibly earlier in his career).  There's also the body-possession element (Shocker).  Come on, man, give us something different.  All the negativity aside, I did think the film had some good atmosphere and it moved at a pretty quick pace.  I'm not saying this was the worst horror movie in the world -- you could do a lot worse just by turning on some of those SyFy movies.  But, as a new work from a renowned auteur of horror, it was definitely disappointing and, in no way, original.  I'm astonished that some of the reviews I've read on Amazon are actually heralding this thing as an original idea.  If you're a seasoned horror fan, you will definitely see the influences of other horror films that utilized their ideas much more effectively.  I love Craven, but, I honestly can't recommend this one.  And, as a side-note:  the theatrical 3D gimmick was extremely weak.  When I saw this in the theater, I had forgotten I was watching a 3D movie!  Check it out, if you must, but be warned: there's really nothing here to keep you watching.",1292889600,2,1696,4.707482993197279

3977860,1,B002S0OB8W,"Not even the likes of Wes Craven
Could save this film from bad movie haven
""Cursed"" and ""Shocker""- those were awful
But this one's so bad, it should be unlawful

It amazes me how people could be suckered in
By a movie that should be in the bargain bin
Even the 3D, with picture so flat
Will make you say ""enough of THAT""

The mystery surrounding a small town killer
is what is the plot of this cringe-worthy thriller
And especially the characters, which we've seen before
Add to this movie being a flat out bore

The dialogue is awful, the acting just sucks
You'll await the end of this waste of hard-earned bucks
And even the twist, which is just a guessing game
Is predictable as hell, and flat out lame

Boring, depressing, unworthy and dull
You'd be better off staring at the nearest wall
Let's hope Wes can improve with Scream 4
Which hopefully will be good and not such a bore",1287619200,9,882,4.359756097560975
3977861,4,B002S0OB8W,"Few horror directors would have the nerve to experiment with the conventions of a teen slasher film, to go beyond the reliable hallmarks of knife-wielding maniacs, bloody corpses, and paper-thin revenge plots. Perhaps that's exactly why Wes Craven wanted to write and direct ""My Soul to Take,"" which is unlike any slasher I've ever seen. In terms of atmosphere, it exists in a gray zone between dreariness and absurdity. In terms of structure, it's a bizarre, meandering dreamscape of grisly murders, horrific visions, and dread secrets. In terms of theme, it could be anything from teenage social circles to heredity to reincarnation to insanity to the California condor, an eater of the dead revered for its ability to clear away the old and usher in the new. I can't pretend that I understood this movie, but at the very least, I never once found it boring.

Set in the fictional town of Riverton, Massachusetts, ""My Soul to Take"" is the story of seven teenagers, who were all born the night a serial killer known as the Riverton Ripper supposedly died. It's now sixteen years later, and members of the community are once again disappearing, just as local legend foretold. Did the Ripper survive his car accident, or does his soul now reside within one of the seven kids? In either case, who has the power to stop him? Is there any way that he can be stopped?

Craven develops his characters to the point of oddness, and yet there's something irresistibly fascinating about them. The main character, Adam Hellerman, a.k.a. Bug (Max Thieroit), freely shifts back and forth between timidity and instability, apparently as the result of his lifelong battle with mental disorders and migraine headaches. At times, he's plagued by dark premonitions and/or revelations. At other times, he can alter his voice and repeat verbatim brief passages of dialogue spoken by his peers, almost as if they were temporarily in possession of his body. Or perhaps he's temporarily in possession of them - the details are more than a little sketchy. I distinctly remember an early scene in which Bug stands in front of his best friend and mimics every single movement he makes, like a reflection in a mirror.

His best friend, named Alex (John Magaro), has strange ideas about acting like a man, most likely as a result of being raised by an abusive stepfather. Whenever he gets hit, he'll calmly say, ""Thank you. That felt good."" He'll then beef up his statements with a swear word or two. He and Bug collaborate on a class presentation on the California condor; as Bug snaps into a trance and rambles in a voice not quite like his own, Alex parades around in an elaborate bird costume equipped with two fluid-filled bottles, one green like vomit, the other brown like feces. This incurs the wrath of the school bully, Brandon (Nick Lashaway), known for chauvinism and other indiscretions. He wants to have sex with Brittany (Paulina Olszynski), who's involved with Bug's sister, nicknamed Fang (Emily Meade), who knows something about Bug's past and hates him for his innocence and for ruining her life. He isn't sure how innocent he actually is.

Is this making any sense at all? It seems that the more I try to describe Craven's twisted logic, the less I understand. What message is he trying to send? That new generations are deeply affected by old generations? That not having a father in your life prevents you from understanding what it is to be a man? ""My Soul to Take"" is a cerebral horror film, the kind that continuously hints at meaning but never gets around to providing us with any. Or maybe it's provided in such a way that an audience wouldn't recognize it. In spite of this, I found the experience oddly absorbing. It may in part have to do with Craven's dialogue, a strange mesh of potty-mouthed teenage talk and deep metaphor, especially in relation to the condor. It may also have to do with the blurring of reality and fantasy; let's just say that Bug's mental state leaves the reliability of the plot in question.

I liken the experience of watching this film to watching Richard Kelly's ""The Box,"" a nonsensical and preposterous but somehow engaging psychological thriller that integrated science fiction with a number of impenetrable themes. ""My Soul to Take"" toys with the audience and toys with it well, but there will always be a part of me that wished I could have figured out was Craven was trying to say. I suspect the vast majority of horror fans will not respond to this movie, given the confusing nature of the plot, the strangeness of the characters, and its unconventional approach to the genre. That's certainly understandable. But for those who have long since grown tired of the average teen slasher film - and I definitely count myself as one of them - this movie may be a welcome change of pace, a chance to see what happens when the genre is turned on its head.",1286668800,26,4885,4.7695035460992905

3977897,5,B002S0OB8W,"i loved this movie. in ways, it was pretty derivative of nightmare on elm street, scream, and most interestingly, shocker, but, for me, it totally worked.

i liked the notions of collective souls acting on things, and i liked the the riverton seven, found them engaging, did not want them to die. and once again, as wes hacks em up, he allows the survivors to linger on and feel what they have lost. i especially liked bug, who was well-played by max thieriot. he was the perfect manic mix of being crazy enough to kill, or is he crazy, eccentric, to keep the viewer guessing about the identity of the riverton ripper.

i also thought the movie was just filmed beautifully. the woods, the river, the amount of action that took place in the daylight, it just really worked for me. bug and alex's California condor presentation was wonderful and inspired, along the lines of nancy's dreamy hamlet moment in elm street. wes tied the california condor's place and plight--to indigenous people they are the keeper of souls; nature's cleanser that makes way for more life; and an animal that tenaciously fought back from the brink of extinction (with a little help from decent, compassionate people)--directly into the movie. i found the condor vibe inseparable from the story, and an appropriate symbol (totem) to represent bug. the way the souls of some of the deceased visited bug to assist and guide him was cool, and reminiscent of other craven movies, like shocker, that allow the living and dead to interface.

another sumptuous, gothic slasher from wes craven and, despite the fashionable criticism against craven and many of his contemporary efforts, he gives us a lush, entertaining movie that allows us to see the power of young people, of love, and of magic.  don't believe the hate: this is a GOOD movie.

*edit*

upon second viewing, i loved my soul to take even more. i just don't understand the negativity towards it. literally, there isn't a second of wasted time in this movie. it unfolds patiently and then, like the projectile vomiting of a condor, just comes spewing at you as we reach the climax. i know that i have extremely elastic and biased tastes--i appreciate all gradations of quality and i'm inclined to look favorably on the work of those that i have a connection with; wes craven obviously fits that bill--but this movie is visually arresting and narratively engaging.

my soul to take is gorgeous, just gorgeous. craven's camera just glides. it really is amazing to see how much he's evolved visually since last house on the left. so much of my soul to take is outside, and craven makes the most of it. and even though he's far removed from his last house exploitation days, craven still retains a strong streak of meanness, unafraid to show us the taboo, especially when young leia sees her father stabbing himself to death in a pool of his own blood on the bathroom floor. there are troubling images in my soul to take; they are simply wrapped in a more comfortable, mature lens.

but what makes my soul to take special are the relationships. the riverton seven--the seven children born on the the night that the riverton ripper was supposedly killed--have each grown up to be their own, unique people, whose relationships cut across high school caste systems. the performers are all excellent, and max therriot as bug is one of craven's finest creations. odd and uncomfortable, bug lives in the shadow of his past, and also has to deal with a steadily accumulating reserve of displaced souls, as the ripper works his way through the riverton seven. these souls help to guide bug as he navigates the impending approach of the ripper, and, again, like in shocker, craven explores the inter-dimensional relationships between the living and the dead. theriot brings a quirky confidence to bug, and i found him easy to root for. emily meade is great as fang, the nineteen year-old senior who runs the social classes of the school, and she is snide, ruthless, and impossible to ignore. she and bug share a delightful secret that isn't officially unveiled until a patient hour has elapsed.

i hope wes continues to direct, but if he's really done, this is a fine movie to go out on, and one worthy of consideration as the director's finest. i also liked all the bird stuff wes slipped in, beyond even the condor totem. i think one has to be a master of their craft and at the top of their game to work ornithology meaningfully into a slasher film. bravo, wes, bravo.",1402272000,,4489,4.744871794871795

3977914,4,B002S0OB8W,"Though not without its faults, Wes Craven's newest teen slasher My Soul To Take has a very interesting premises; think Identity meets Scream meets A Nightmare On Elm Street 4.

The story goes is that 16 years ago the town of Riverton was terrorized by a serial killer known by the media as the Riverton Ripper.  The trouble is is that the Ripper is a latent personality of Abel Plaincoft who is barely aware that he's the killer.  But one night, the Ripper attacked and killed Abel's pregnant wife and tried to kill his daughter Lea before he was brought down by both Abel and the police.  However, fate intervenes when the ambulance carrying him to the hospital crashes and his body is never recovered.  At the moment of his death, seven local children are born including Abel's premature baby.

Fast forward to the present and these seven lucky kids have grown up with a kind of local celebrity but fully aware that every year their birthday rolls around, the ghost of the Ripper may come back for revenge.  Unfortunately, their sweet sixteen is about to be permanently interrupted.

I really enjoyed this movie.  The movie itself was a box office bomb but don't let that dissuade you from giving it a chance.  The three main stars Max Theriot (Chloe, The House At the End of the Street), Emily Meade, and John Magaro deliver strong performances and definitely prove they will go far in their careers, particularly Theriot for, at one point, all seven personalities come out and each one he gives are mirror images to his co-stars that its unreal.

However,  there are a few loose ends that are never fully explained.  Why does the school seems to be in mortal fear of Fang (Meade)?  What exactly do these numbers of her's mean (""Give Hellerman a 3 and Dunkleman an 8."")?  And why does the Ripper sound a lot like Jackie Earl Hayley (Watchmen, A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010)?  Still, I highly recommend this over the latest Paranormal Activity snorefest or Saw part Infinity.",1354665600,,1978,4.673410404624278

3977921,3,B002S0OB8W,"Wes Craven returns with his latest film since 2005's Red Eye, and many horror fans will surely be wondering whether or not the man still has it. I personally enjoyed Red Eye, heck I even had fun with his other 2005 work Cursed, so fortunately I did not feel the need evaluate the man's abilities.

My Soul to Take marks Craven's return to the slasher genre by following a psychopathic killer dubbed as The Riverton Ripper. In the opening scene, the Ripper murders his wife along with many others, and ""allegedly"" dies during a wreck while in ambulance transport. That same night seven babies are born. The film then fast-forwards to sixteen years later.

The kids, dubbed as The Riverton Seven, feel a special bond regarding their shared births, though that doesn't mean they are friends. Bug (Thieriot) and his best friend Alex (Magaro), both part of the Seven, constantly get picked on. Bug is a bird loving nerd, and truthfully he's the only character we really get to know well. The rest of the crew are fairly cliche and somewhat odd teen characters from the standard douche jock and pretty preppy girl to a Jesus obsessed redhead. Needless to say, the seven are linked to the killer's legacy and on the anniversary of his ""death,"" people will die.

The beginning of the film took me some getting used to. I am reminded by Jennifer's Body in that the dialog and characters did not reflect much of reality. In fact, it's as if they didn't attempt to do so. Same goes in this movie, the dialog and situations regarding the characters were fairly bizarre. For example, the character Fang (Meade) seemingly controls the social and scholastic lives of the seven (such as in taking over the girls bathroom, dishing out orders to abuse certain kids by assigning levels of power in which to punch them...yeah, it gets that weird).

After I adjusted to Craven's imagined high school nightmare, I became quite entangled in the story. I found myself wondering what the deal was. Did the killer come back for some sort of revenge or unfinished business? Was he reincarnated in one of the seven? There were small references to Voodoo and Native American mythologies which lead me to believe more towards a supernatural explanation. I really did enjoy everything that was going on.

Aside from the odd dialog and scenarios, the acting was fairly good all around. Like I mentioned though I didn't learn much about the other characters except Bug and Alex, but really they ended up being enough to make the film fun. I also still had a few questions in my head after the movie ended, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Overall it was a fun and after the second half, an engaging and exciting film.

In regards to the 3D presentation of this film, of which I had no other choice, I was let down. I didn't see the need for 3D in this movie aside from maybe 3 scenes. But with that aside, like I said I had a fun time watching this latest installment from a horror master. Is Wes Craven transforming genres the way he's done in the past with several of his films? Not with this one, but sure I think he is capable of doing so again. Either way, he's created a decent modern slasher with an interesting story.

3977923,3,B002S0OB8W,"With MY SOUL TO TAKE Wes Craven plonks you right in the middle of things. The story's opening sequence regales the viewer with the harrowing capture of Abel Plenkov a.k.a the notorious Riverton Ripper. What starts out as a straight-up psychological thriller takes a supernatural bend when a policewoman descended from Haiti mentions guff about a person sometimes having multiple souls. Abel Plenkov proves to be a slippery collar and manages one final stab at freedom. He vanishes by the river in the woods where it's presumed that he died. And, in the same town, on the same evening that the Riverton Ripper draws his last breath, seven babies are born.

Sixteen years later and the children of the town of Riverton gather to celebrate Ripper Day to commemorate the anniversary of the Ripper's death and to celebrate the births of the Riverton Seven. It's all for shucks and giggles, of course. There's some goofy annual ceremony centering around one of the Seven being chosen to ward off the ""returning"" Riverton Ripper (in the form of a dressed-up dummy). This time Adam (a.k.a. ""Bug"") is elected, except that Bug can't play the game. Bug (Max Thieriot) is one of them sensitive kids. He has issues. Rumor has it that he may've been institutionalized in the past. He may've killed people. In Riverton's high school circles, he's regarded as prey. He's best friends with Alex Dunkelman (John Magaro), another of the Seven and a misfit like Bug.

Even years after the Ripper's passing, the town hasn't been restored to normalcy, not when it boasts groups called the Citizens for a Saner Riverton, not when the kids are rallying for a sleazy event like Ripper Day. One would think that the Riverton Seven may form a clique, but that's not the way it goes, not when the Seven comprise of losers and quarterbacks and a popular girl and a religious girl. There's really no BREAKFAST CLUB moment here. Even when, on Ripper Day, the Seven begin to get picked off, one by one, there's no banding together. Abel Plenkov, back from the river (or beyond), doesn't give them enough time.

It dawns on the remaining Seven that maybe the urban legend is true, that Abel Plenkov's soul may have gone into one of them. But which one? The spiritual Penelope? The popular Brittany? The token black guy Jerome? The token Asian guy Jay? The bullying quarterback Brandon? Alex Dunkelman, who frequently gets beat up by his dad? Or Bug, the damaged goods? Some of these kids begin to anticipate each other's words and mimic each other's gestures. It's perhaps a cause for concern when one of these kids begins to mirror Plenkov's personality.

Every now and then, Wes Craven has a habit of half-steppin'. For each delectable horror picture he trots out (DRAG ME TO HELL, SHOCKER, SCREAM), you get lesser efforts like CURSED, VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN, and this one, MY SOUL TO TAKE. This one's middle of the pack stuff, an average horror thriller. Excepting the pretty suspenseful opening sequence, there aren't any solid ""boo"" moments to make you twitch. The kills are all done too quickly, they seem perfunctory somehow. The script is so leaden it drags down the narrative. It's hard to care for the characters when they seem to come straight from central casting. The most interesting person on film is the hot goth girl Leah a.k.a. ""Fang"" (Emily Meade). Fang is three years older than the Riverton Seven. She runs the school by virtue of being the meanest kid on the block. She rolls off some very choice dialogue.

Wes Craven does pull a fast one or two. Characters whom you assume just may make it thru alive, don't, and, in the third act, there is an unexpected character turn and an enlightening character reveal. But that third act also gives us the big showdown in Bug's home. This sequence, in which the Ripper stalks his few remaining victims, is done by the numbers. It's disappointing. It's a scene that SCREAM typically makes fun of, has in fact done better. The film's highlight moment may've been Bug and Alex Dunkelman's side-splitting class tutorial on the California Condor. What does it say when an occult serial killer is upstaged by a bird? 2.5 out of 5 stars for this one. As I said, MY SOUL TO TAKE is strictly middle of the pack.

- 2 Alternate (and Ghostly) Endings

3977924,3,B002S0OB8W,"My Soul to Take certainly had a ton of potential.  A Jack the Ripper-type bad guy comes back after 16 years to kill a group of teenagers.  However, I actually think there's two major problems that prevent the movie from reaching greatness.

One of them is that much of the storytelling is incredibly sloppy and unorganized.  At least the first half is.  You can pretty much guess that most of these teens are going to die eventually, however the beginning segment where the teens are shown outside at night by a lake and attempting an annual ritual that involves summoning the Jack the Ripper monster is pretty confusing because we aren't sure whether to take it seriously or not.  In other words, we aren't initially sure whether this is a joke on the part of the teens or whether Jack the Ripper really IS coming back to continue his killing spree.  Plus there's the fact it just wasn't a professionally written way to introduce the main characters.

The pacing of the entire first half of the film went over my head completely, and it wasn't until a scene that takes place in the woods that some consistency pertaining to suspense actually occurs.  Before this segment, we were basically treated to teens acting fairly normal while attending high school and getting into typical fights and arguments that happen between kids among this age group.  Oh, and that entire show and tell segment involving a vomit-spraying costume that takes place in the front of the classroom is the very definition of confusion.  I had NO idea what was going on.  Perhaps the bad acting contributed to the confusion, who knows?

Another problem is that, for a horror or a suspense, a good portion of the storyline dragged.  The movie is around 100 minutes long, but I swear it should have been shortened by a good 30 minutes or so.  Too much needless talking between the characters and nothing compelling occurring to warrant many of these overlong conversational segments.

I guess another obvious flaw is that the entire movie feels like it's intended more for kids and young teens as opposed to adults.  Alright to be fair, basically ALL horror films are intended for teens, but this one in particular feels like its main target is between the ages of 12-16.

Overall, I'm pretty disappointed, however when the actual killings occur, this is when My Soul to Take is actually fairly decent so I won't write it off completely.",1323302400,,2410,4.752403846153846
3977925,1,B002S0OB8W,"This is supposed to be a film by one of the top directors in Hollywood...but what a mess!

My first problem was with the dialogue. Some of the delivery was mumbled and difficult to hear. Then, the one character tends to make something an opposite, and that got confusing. For example, he gets punched in the gut, and instead of saying it hurt, he would say it felt good. I realize this was his way of getting through tough times, but sometimes this logic was applied to out of the ordinary situations and it became confusing.

The next issue was continuity. This film had NONE. All characters suffered this. Watch their hair. In one scene, a hair style can change shape, color, and styles, and no one notices. It can go from flat to fluffy in seconds!  Another boo-boo is one character sneaks back into the house after curfew. he dives into his bed fully dressed, his arm above the covers...in the next second, his arm is completely covered!

3977928,2,B002S0OB8W,"We learned two things while viewing this movie.

1.) Never ever harm one feather on the American Condor and 2.) we won't watch another Wes Craven film.

We enjoyed most of Wes Craven's work.  We enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, Last House on the Left, Nightmare on Elm Street films (most of them anyhoo - a few were stinkers), Shocker (we got a giggle from the villian), People Under the Stairs, Cursed (we think it is suppose to be a comedy), the Scream movies (very funny) among others....so we are indeed fans of his work.

However, this was not up to par.  It took a while to get started and quite frankly I don't understand the whole school rating system and life story subplot???  The witty banter amongst highschool students was rather lame and gave no substance to the movie.  Characters: boy with abusive father, girl obsessed with religion, boy who may have multiple personality disorder who has a sister who hates him, blind boy who can climb on roofs and get around without any assistsnce, the main guy's love interest, the jock and the boring character who is there for cannon fodder.  Why the father is abusive is not ever explained, the sister's dislike of her brother is a lame excuse, how does a blind boy climb trees and roofs with the stealth of a cat?  Those are only a few questions unanswered...and those don't have any bearing why the killings happen???

A killer dies only to come back and possess one of the children born on the day he died...sounds like an interesting idea but being bogged down with the teenage life subplot took away from the serial killings.  Also, the pacing was a bit slow and all the ""visions"" that point to ""multiple personality disorder"" are rather pointless since that angle is never pursued.  Plus, what is the point of having a presentation of the American Condor?  Other viewers have asked this but aside from the guy's voice being more pronounced nothing really changed.  The costume was rather interesting and it was funny to have the jock spewed upon from both directions...but didn't add anything.

Also, the ending does a quick wrap up explaination and mentions an agreement made with Bug's father...however, the agreement is never explained so we never know what the agreement states.

On a side note, one viewer said the film lacked originality and I do agree.  A group of kids are stalked by a masked killer carrying a knife who likes calling them and asking them questions....much like Scream but without the comedy.",1319155200,2,2476,4.72093023255814

Later our main character ""Bug"" is in school getting beat up and is angsting about girls for about 30 minutes.  What does this have to do with the killer?  I don't care, get back to people being killed!  Okay so every kid born on the day that the killer died is being murdered exactly 16 years later.  Why?  Why are they being killed?  What does this ""evil soul"" gain from it?  What did it wait 16 years?  What's so magical about the number 16?  We never find out and it's never explained.

Later we find out that the ""evil soul,"" made a deal with Bug's father.  Why?  What was the deal?  What was each side getting out of the deal?  It's never explained, we're just expected to accept it.

Also, why is Bug obsessed with the California Condor?  It's never explained and it never had any impact on the story other than the fact that he makes a costume of one and goofs around in school with it.  The mother does say that it's a bird of ""Spiritual rejuvenation that cleanses the earth of the dead so that new life can begin.""  Okay...and???  Seriously, that's the only explanation we're ever given about this character trait.

At the end of the movie when Bug kills his friend who was possessed by the killer, the cops show up.  Explain this to me, why do the police believe a 19 year old punk girl with a criminal record when she says that her retarded 16 year old brother who is in a house full of dead bodies, is covered in blood, AND holding the murder weapon is innocent.  No questions asked, he's just instantly applauded as a hero who killed the killer in self defense.  Seriously, he's not even held for questioning or taking into custody, not ONE question do the police ask about what happened.  They just show up, nod their heads at him and clean up the bodies and the blood.

3977935,1,B002S0OB8W,"Buried in this mostly-mess of a slasher movie are some interesting bits about the condor in Native American mythology and the idea of multiple souls being housed in one body. Unfortunately, neither of these concepts get developed satisfactorily by old warhorse Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream), as by-the-book teenager slashing occupies way, way too much screentime.

One of the oddly jarring things about this movie is that it confuses schizophrenia and multiple-personality disorder in its tale of a schizophrenic serial killer with multiple personalities, one of which is a serial killer. Frankly, it's sorta dumb. Seven teenagers born the night the serial killer -- blandly named the Ripper! -- died in the small town of Riverton are now 16. Apparently, that means they're of legal age to get slaughtered.

But is the serial killer dead? Is one of the teenagers possessed by the evil spirit of the serial killer's serial-killing personality? And why is there an entire subplot about the evils of high school that plays like a bush-league version of Heathers?

Yes, there are many mysteries here, including how a slasher film ended up with a jaunty cartoon for its end credits.

3977939,2,B002S0OB8W,"From ""The Hills Have Eyes"" to ""Scream"" Craven has reenergized the genre with many of his films helping to reinvent a genre that had run out of steam several times. He's also directed his fair share of bad movies and ""My Soul to Take"" falls into that category as it is predictable and almost amateurish compared to many of his other films.

The premise itself wouldn't be so bad except even for a horror film it has too many coincidences and implausible plot points. It's as if Craventook a mental vacation while directing this film forgetting everything he learned from ALL the films he's directed and many of the missteps here are what I would expect from a first time writer/director. Many of the shots are clumsy in both set up and execution and the exposition isn't handled very well either with most plot points telegraphed as if the audience had an I.Q. of 50.

The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a solid looking presentation. The problem for many people will be the fact that this is a flipper disc. Didn't Universal learn from their past mistake using dual layered, flipper discs? They weren't popular, prone to problems that occurred due to the pressing process, easier to damage and, in general, a bad format idea. I hope tha this horrible format bites the dust and soon.

I also have to wonder WHY this was shown in 3D? None of the shots take advantage of the format and it clearly was just a move to capitalize on the popularity of the format at the time.

Audio sounds fine throughout.

The special features are underwhelming as well with stars Max Thieriot, John Magaro, Emily Meade and director Wes Craven discussing the making of the film and oblivious to how bad it is. We also get about 20 minutes of deleted scenes, two alternate endings and an alternate opening for the film. None of these would have improved the film which has the premise for a solid TV episode (if not for the implausible elements which continue to build throughout the film)and a predictable whodunnit element.

""My Soul to Take"" is an awful horror film lacking any thrills and, at times, it looks like it was written and directed by someone who doesn't understand the genre at all.

Skip it.

A serial killer suffering from dissocative personality disorder (misidentified as schizophrenia in the film which is a DIFFERENT condition)ends up killing his wife before being shot by police. He disappears after being rushed to the hospital after making a vow tha the would return to kill any children born on that night. His daughter survives.

It is suggested that, perhaps, his soul would inhabit one of the seven babies born the night he died.

 Evidently it is not a question of the better thing of Craven but, My Soul To take possesses sufficient interesting elements as for to consider it to be a minimum as a good attempt of ""update"" of the classic slasher, in the movie we find interesting readings to near the human condition where important mas is not in the resolution of the conflict in if,If not in the learning and the way that we have to take to come ultimately, if we could classify to every movie since to a human being of different age it would dare to say that soul My to take is a 16-year-old teenager .. with his fears and insecurities and his personality still for developing completely.

3977945,3,B002S0OB8W,"Wes Craven has had a rough decade since the Scream franchise finished(though the fourth film is now out and doing well).  Scream 3 felt rushed, and tired. It lacked a lot of the wit and true twisted surprises or the previous films.  Cursed was a total and well publicized disaster that barely worked as a horror movie or a spoof. Now outside the horror genre Craven has been very successful(not counting his producing credits on two remakes, Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, of his classics) with the very underrated and suspenseful high concept thriller Red Eye and the drama Music of the Heart.  Being a huge Craven fan I've been waiting with baited breath for his triumphant return to kick-butt horror.  I thought I would get it when the first trailers for My Soul to Take appeared.  Well, I was only half right....

Firstly, when the trailer heavily advertised that the film was in 3D I knew I was in for a film that the studio wasn't 100 percent behind.  Does horror, real horror, really need to be in 3D?  Does it really add anything to the scare factor?  Yeah,I don't think so either.  Then when you see scenes in the trailer that are not in the film but on the deleted scenes section you get the sneaking suspicion that there were other big-wig hands in the kitchen outside of the director.  Despite having made more than three hugely successful films in the horror genre there are still folks who don't give him final cut and tamper with this films.  My Sould to Take is sooooo loaded with long-winded scenes of characters expousing long lines of dialogue about the plot that it becomes exposition overload.  Weirdly enough, the more the plot and concept is explained the more muddled it seems to get.

I love the concept of this film.  It's the usual high concept type of horror that Craven usually writes, whether he succedes or not.  It revolves around seven teens all born the night that the Riverton Ripper was supposedly caught and killed.  The seven teens are all different but know each other one way or another.  Riverton Ripper style killings start to crop up and the question arises: is the Ripper alive and back at his old trick or has his twisted, and apparently schisophrenic soul jumped into one of the seven teens born the night he died.  The film answers these questions with great zest, but over explains them to the point of drowsiness.  It's unfortunate to see a film sink by the weight of its own concept.

The acting is all fine.  The kids all seem real and off-kilter in some cases. The final act chase suspense scene is well done and in the Craven Scream/Nightmare on Elm. Street tradition. It all goes down quite satisfyingly until the villain is revealed and his endless dialogue regarding why he is the villain is produced.  The only real creepy moment happens early on, on the celebration of Ripper day.  A teen walks alone down a bridge to find a masked figure just charge at him and unforgivingly slash him to death.  It's simple, to the point, and felt very real.  The opening moments in the past where we meet our schizoid original Ripper are great too.  The opening just builds on itself with one surprise after another.

The blu ray looks great, as all Craven films do, even the older lower budget films.  The special features are lackluster I must say.  The deleted scenes, more importantly the alternate opening and alternate ending, should have been included in the film's final cut.  The alternate opening has a visual reference to Craven's Nightmare Elm Street, plus it reveals why the film is even called My Sould to Take.  Maybe it was deleted because the remake of Nightmare on Elm Street has a similar scene which is a direct riff on Craven's scene in the original Nightmare.  Don't know, but wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.  Finally, there is one alternate ending where it is revealed VISUALLY, without tons of expositional dialogue, what our main character, named Bug, is and his purpose regarding souls.  It's great, kind of touching, and a little chilling.  Why were these things removed?  They make the film stand out of the usual slasher stuff.  The commentary track is okay.  I really loved Craven's tracks for Hills Have Eyes, Nightmare, and his shared commentary with Kevin Williamson on Scream.  The actors and Craven go into detail on how things were done but not much in the way of what they mean.  And there is a ton of visual metaphors floating in this film involving condors and such.  It's more technical and jovial than I would've preferred.

The movie is not as bad as you've heard but it isn't that good either.  I didn't hate it but I have no real reasons to gush over it either.  The concept is good and there but seems buried.  The film feels like someone with the money got cold feet once the film was completed and started asking for reshoots and padding.  I think horror should be more abstract.  There doesn't always need to be an explanation that fits neatly in a box.  I've always contended that the unknown is far scarier.  To quote Billy Loomis, ""Did they ever really explain why Hannibal Lector liked to eat people?  NO, don't think so!""  Hardcore horror fans will most likely be disappointed, as well as Craven fans.  I put this film in the same catergory as Scream 3, Vampire in Brooklyn or Shocker as far as the Craven cannon goes: is not quite awful,b ut it's not memorable and you know it could've been so much more.",1303171200,,5431,4.597294484911551
3977946,1,B002S0OB8W,"This movie is about a serial killer with multiple personalities who gets caught. Wait...No, it's about a group of friends who include a weirdo, his best buddy, a blind black kid who gets around everywhere in the town without a seeing eye dog and who is really Forest Whittaker's son, and several other teenagers who were born on the same day as the killer who may all be killers themselves (??). Darn...that's not right either...OK. This movie is really about a boy who is mentally disturbed and has a weird penchant for dressing up like a condor bird and freaking other people out for no reason.

Actually, I give up...I went to see this at the movie theatre. The film was shown in the smallest room at the darkest end of the emptiest theatre hallway. The movie itself was so incredibly insignificant that the theatre people didn't bother to put the sign up at the door to even let us know that we were in the right room. After that, the movie started and people began to get up and leave, one by one until it was just me and my best friend. My friend and I suspected that we were fools for staying, yet once we realized the movie was never going to make any sense it was too late....One week later the movie was no longer featured at any movie cinema in the U.S., but the worst thing is this: I still have no clue what it was about!",1303084800,5,1334,4.314741035856573

When I got home after seeing Scream 4 I decided to keep to the Craven theme and chucked My Soul To Take in. I watched the whole thing and wished I didn't even bother. Especially after watching Scream 4 it doesnt even come close in comparison and I cannot believe it is even a Wes Craven movie. Go see Scream - it is brilliant. My Soul To Take is NOT!!,1302998400,7,493,3.98989898989899

3977949,4,B002S0OB8W,"""My Soul to Take"" is a different kind of Wes Craven teen slasher/horror movie - instead of mindless carnage, we have a character development along with a rather complicated plot that includes many twists and turns. The setup is 15 years early in an series of scene that take about a quarter of the movie. Here, a serial killer may or may not have been killed by the police, after murdering his very pregnant wife, and 7 kids are mysteriously born prematurely. Fast forward 15 yrs and we have the 7 high school age teens, who bizarrely ""celebrate"" the killer deathday along with their birthdays. We kinda get to know the teens (the character development part) as, of course, they start to mysteriously get slashed. Questions appear. Is the serial killer still alive and well doing the dirty work? Or has the malevolent soul transmogrified to one of the teens? Is the lead character Bug (the cutie Max Theriot) crazy, or just appear that way? Why does Alex (John Magaro) stick to Bug like glue? What is the all powerful (at school that is) character Fang (Emily Meade) relationship to Bug, what is her agenda? Who's going to be the last teen standing? The script is pretty good, and the story keeps bring up new twists every minute. Of course you have the creepy music, and lots of action in semi-darkness - hallmarks of horror films. Overall I'd say ""My Soul To Take"" brings a unique look at the horror/slasher genre and is worth viewing",1302825600,,1436,4.635294117647059

3977951,5,B002S0OB8W,"Okay so I read the reviews and thought at it's worst, it would be just okay. I didn't expect it to exceed my best expectations either though. The reason it works so well is because all movies of this genre usually have some predictability to it when trying to figure out who's who and what's what. In 'My Soul to Take' you honestly will have no idea until the moment it's revealed. Everytime you think you have things figured out, you will second guess yourself over and over and over again.

Nothing is as it seems and nothing is predictable until the movie itself decides to let you know who's who and what's what. This was done in a very clever and brilliant way that's rarely seen anymore.

  The premise of the movie itself surrounds the Riverton seven. The Riverton 7 are 7 kids born on the same date that a killer known as the Ripper is finally caught and killed.. or was he? The kids are now teens and it's their 16th b-day. Every year the kids have this creepy, but all in good fun ceremony at the site of where the Ripper supposedly died. They also have this ceremony out of the connection between the Ripper and their births.. as they refer to theselves as the Riverton Seven.

  Every one of the seven kids has their own personalities, while also each being very stereotypical. You have the jock, the popular girl, the geeks, the bible thumper, etc.. but as different as they all are, they seem to be very much connected due to having the same birthday. The relationship between 2 of the Riverton Seven who are also best friends is perfect. They're so different, but just enough alike to make you really understand why they're so close.

  As killings begin, so does the puzzle. Did the Ripper ever really die? Is this a prank gone horribly wrong in an attempt to scare everyone? Is one or all of the Riverton seven responsible? Or is it none of the above? You will think you know all these answers many times throughout the movie. But everytime you think you have it pinpointed, you'll be wrong again and again.

  You will literally be kept guessing until it's finally revealed FOR you. I highly recommend this movie for ppl of all movie genres.. not just horror, or paranormal, or a thrasher film. It's very well done with just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat until the final scene.",1301875200,11,2339,4.4496487119437935

The special effects are laughable.  The only character development comes at the end of the movie.  The ending is a giant jumbled mess.

Another shockingly bad plot ""twist"" was an entire TOWN gets together to celebrate the grisly murders of seven people.  What happened to the Fourth of July?

The first ten minutes or so are tense and exciting fooling the viewer into thinking they are in for a fun thrill ride-it doesn't happen, even so within that ten minutes is one of the dumbest sequences I've seen in a long time.

Would a policeman fire multiple shots into a knife-weilding maniacs back when that policeman knows that standing in front of and facing the madman is a 6 year old girl?

The bulk of the movie is badly paced, all fits and starts-kinda like an arthritic chipmunk on crutches. 7 children are born the same night the serial killer ""dies"" and 16 years later his spirit returns to off the birthday teens, even his spirit moves between them so one or more of the kids is murdering the others. But which one? Maybe it's the one who has a fascination with American condors-maybe it's the oddball-maybe it's, who cares?

The climax of the movie is ok but ruins itself by slowing down and going on too long making one think something is going to make you jump but just like that arthritic chipmunk it just limps off.

So I was semi-excited to view it for first time. Well that enjoyment lasted for about 25 minutes. Opening scene was great IMO, but the movie went downhill from there, attempted to get confusing, became cheesy with CGI killings and one liners, as well as being predictable. I won't add any spoilers so you can see for yourself, I don't like ruining anyone's viewing as I don't like mine ruined. This movie seemed rushed, and should not have been. There was definite potential here, just poorly executed. I'm not big into cheesy horror, and this was one of em. I enjoy all the screams, the original nightmare, original hills have eyes, even original last house on the left, but this one seemed like an outlier, being something completely different from Craven. Sometimes different can be good, with this movie, different was not best choice.

If you really want to watch it, just rent it so you don't dish out 20 or 25 bucks. It's not something you'll want to watch over and over like Craven's others. I hope that I've been helpful..

The effects were good and there were some very scary moments throughout the film.

It wasn't heavy on the gore but it supplied just enough to satisfy my lust for carnage.
There are of course a couple of surprises throughout and just when I thought I had it figured out I was wrong. There was a bit of ambiguity thrown in so one could form there own opinion if the most obvious answer wasn't to their liking.

The Character of Bug was played to perfection by 'Max Thieriot'.
I liked that it was a sophisticated slasher in a high school setting,so it gave you a bit of the old school slasher feel but was fresh at the same time.

The acting was completely off and many of the times the lines just felt forced from the actors' mouths. More often then not, the actors were never really scared, a little weird in and of themselves, but not afraid. They said they were, but they didn't convey they were. I don't want alot of screaming from the actors when they see a dead body of their friend, but for a couple of them, they weren't even shocked.

Much of it just ended up feeling cheesy and disconnected from the rest of the story.

I don't recommend buying this, which I did. Its worth about five dollars or less.

I couldn't believe something like this came from Wes Craven. I was prepared for a great movie, and left feeling extremely disatisfied.

As for the actual product: the alternate endings actually weren't so bad, the disc gives two different ones. Along with deleted scenes and the feature commentary with Wes Craven (and some of the other actors).",1297382400,,1102,4.545454545454546
3977974,1,B002S0OB8W,"My Soul to Take marks legendary horror helmer Wes Craven's first foray as a writer/director since 1994's awesome New Nightmare, but sadly enough, the film lacks any of the inventiveness, personality, or plain guts that made Craven such a force to be reckoned with in the first place.  The plot revolves around a group of teens, all of whom were born the night that a schizophrenic serial killer known as The Ripper was killed.  Now one of them (Max Thieriot) appears to be exhibiting similar behavior, and those around him are dropping like flies.  Drawing heavily on his own A Nightmare on Elm Street, My Soul to Take instead finds Craven injecting the film with some atrocious dialogue, horrible acting, bland and boring pacing, and some unbelievably sloppy editing as well.  It really strikes me hard to see Craven behind something so bad as this film.  I was never a fan of his much loved Scream series, but I'd take any of those films over this piece of crud.  Do yourself a favor, no matter how much of a fan you may be of Wes Craven's classic horror films, avoid My Soul to Take at any and all costs.",1297382400,,1107,4.5376884422110555
3977975,4,B002S0OB8W,"This movie was really good for the first 20 minutes and it had us completely hooked in and scared.  After that it started to go a little down hill and got kind of silly in parts, but overall it was still a good movie.  I think what kept it from being great is they didn't keep up the momentum created in the first 20 minutes and also the acting wasn't top notch by a few of the characters.  This had the potential to be a truly scary movie and I wish it would have kept that feeling from the first 20 minutes up.  I still enjoyed the movie rental.",1297296000,,547,3.9908256880733943
3977976,4,B002S0OB8W,"I had wanted to see this movie ever since the trailer came about, as I am a big fan of craven's movies. But with doing research, I was leery of buying this due to the amount of negative reviews. Well let me just say, you cannot judge a book by its cover. I was surprised to find that this craven slasher was a breath of fresh air to the genre. Of course its not as good as scream, but then again its hard to top a movie that redefined the franchise. The whole storyline of soul possession was brilliant, and something different for a change. Never once did I find this movie confusing, or boring for that fact. If you have followed the ""SAW"" movies for the past years, then you'll have no problem piecing this one together. Not that those two movies are anything alike, but some of the saw's were confusing at times. Anyhow, there is blood throughout the film, nothing extreme, but enough to satisfy you gore lovers, like myself. There are some jump scares here and there, especially if you have surround sound.  The film itself has the weirdest premise I have ever seen before, guess that's really what drew me to it. That and the creepy settings, were very atmospherical. The bridge in the first fifteen minutes or so was a standout piece, and very ominous. The design of the ripper himself is one of the creepiest looking villains since jeepers creepers, I think. One of my favorite, and most laughable scenes in the film is where ""Bug"" (Max Thieriot) has a class presentation and chooses the California condor as the subject. Wes definitely added his touch of humor to that scene, and what about that bird costume? Very cool, if I do say so myself. All in all people who have an open mind, and will appreciate this film for what it is for will enjoy it.  This is definitely not the worst horror film of 2010, SAW: The Final Chapter takes that title. Wtf were they thinking? Pink blood, seriously? Good concept, but the realism of the movie was laughable due to this effects guys...holly wood is getting lazy. :p  (MY SOUL TO TAKE) **** OUT OF FIVE STARS.",1297209600,21,2058,4.468085106382978
3977977,4,B002S0OB8W,"Ok, so yes, this movie uses a lot of elements that have been done before. So what? It uses them well. Max Thieriot does a fantastic job as Bug, and the movie's more a story of growing up and the loss of innocence then anything else It's interesting, and it moves pretty well. Unlike the other reviewers, I am not a fan of Wes Craven movies, but I like this one. If you love horror and slasher films, this probably isn't for you. But if you, like me, love thrillers nd psychological films, then you should definitely watch this.",1297123200,,527,4.333333333333333
3977978,4,B002S0OB8W,"A killer is loose - sort of. In the past, a man known as The Ripper killed with impunity in a town no bigger than my thumbnail. The problem was that this person had different ""souls"" and those souls, multiple personalities if it makes it easier to see - were creepy. They also allowed him to disappear and to never be seen again (despite shots and despite knife injuries). The day this happened was also a milestone for babies to come early - seven happened to come on that day. Afterward, alegend was tailored about The Ripper and the teen that had to slay him. thus Ripper Night was concieved. This year, a teen called Bug had to slay it in a ceremonial fight and things went wrong, real wrong. That's when the oddities started and the dying came a'calling.

honestly, hearing about this Wes Craven movie made me think Shocker at first - the movie, not a snide comment. The whole soul thing and the traversing bodies idea in the preview made me see Horace Pinker again, and i'm not sure that was great. I liked shocker back then, but I was really little, too. When it started up My Soul to Take threw the comparison aside, showing me something right away. Creepy people, creepy killers - something Wes can really do.

As far as the movie design, it has elements that are truly Wes Craven's format. The way the teeens are and the way the town is, not to mention the baddies design - it all says Scream and more. That's not bad, either, but it does take time to see past. Accordingly, the first time has to be done with a clear mind or you might see the wrong things. I know - I have problems doing that even though I say not to.

Bloody, yes, and nice on the kills. It also had some decent acting and a nice set, making it seem like The Ripper could be anywhere. Couple that with the knife, the beginning, and a person at the start that should get a lot of awards for his Ripper portrayal but won't and you have something nice. Just don't expect it to be groundbreaking.

I liked it - a lot. I know it was not new or promising in a lot of ways BUt it had some good stuff. also, it transfers well from 3-D and that is HARd to say. Too often movies are just filmed for that setting and it hurts. Still, if you think this won't be good it won't be. Expectation is a beast and then some.
4/5 for the movie - it is not without flaw but so are most movies.",1297123200,5,2351,4.183222958057395
3977979,2,B002S0OB8W,"Every year on ""Ripper Day"" (the day where a serial killer known as the Ripper died) seven friends who share a birthday get together to ""ward off his spirit"".  This year something different happens.  During the annual ""Ripper day"" festivities Bug (Thieriot) is chosen to ""fight off the ripper"", after he fails his friends say its all a joke anyway and not to worry.  But then things go wrong.  This movie had a very neat idea : the ripper had seven multiple personalities and seven kids were born the day he died, supposedely with each of his personalities.  After the initial build up, the movie never really gets going.  I found it to be very boring and not scary at all.  I think it was trying to be a ""Friday the 13th"" type movie but never got there.  This is a movie where after you watch it you feel nothing.  I give it a C-.

3977980,1,B002S0OB8W,"Ugh.  Total waste of time.  A basic mashup of Craven's older (and better) films cause he clearly he has no imagination left but had to spew something out to cover rent.

The first 5 minutes were actually good.  The remaining hour and a half is a confusing mess of poor acting, poor script writing, poor cinematography, poor gore (or lack there of).

Do yourself the favour and check out the new film Chain Letter.  While not ground breaking either, it makes the most of what a fun slasher should be like.",1296777600,5,504,4.483516483516484

8378989,3,B002S0OB8W,"RELEASED IN 2010 and directed/written by Wes Craven, My Soul to Take is a slasher movie about the high schoolers of Riverton, Connecticut, and the legend that a schizophrenic serial killer will return to murder the teens born the day he died 16 years earlier. Its not clear if the killer actually died (his body was never found, dun, dun, dun) or if his soul will possess one or more of the kids in order to conduct his wicked deeds.

I wasn't aware that this was a Wes Craven production while watching (I mustve missed it in the opening credits), but the unrealistic tone and general dramatics reminded me of Cravens Scream (1996), albeit without the humor. So I wasn't surprised when the end credits revealed this was Wes baby.

I liked how Wes used actors who actually looked like teens and, in some cases, were teens during filming, like Paulina Olszynski, who was not quite 18 playing 16 year-old Brittany, and Emily Meade, who was 20 playing 19 year-old Fang.

Zena Grey is on hand as a fundamentalist Christian, Penelope. Unfortunately, as is typical for Craven, Penelopes religiosity is so overdone I busted out laughing at a couple of her melodramatic statements. Memo to Craven: Actual staunch believers rarely talk in that heavy-handed manner to other people, particularly high schoolers, who simply aren't that overt & bold about their Christianity.

In any case, the condor-charade-in-the-classroom sequence perked my attention because it was so quirky and compelling. There are some interesting ideas in the script (e.g. the soul of someone who dies passing into someone being born) and I appreciated that this isn't just a slasher flick, but also a coming-of-age high school movie. Max Thieriot  & John Magaro emerge as the protagonists (or maybe antagonists), Bug and Alex, and they're competent, but I had trouble getting into the dramatics of the characters. Nothing seemed real; it felt like the Twilight Zone. I suppose it didn't help that some of the story elements are a bit convoluted. It also didn't help that the females, while more than serviceable, lacked sex appeal IMHO.

Craven is renowned in horror circles, but hes had his share of clunkers (e.g. 1988s The Serpent and the Rainbow). My Soul to Take falls somewhere in the middle.

THE MOVIE RUNS 108 minutes and was shot in Connecticut (New Milford, Danbury & Tolland).
