6120016,5,B00GVFJ5PE,I love the Red Soxs and this video truly captures the spirit of the 2013 season and the Team that were impacted very directly by the tragedy and trauma of the Boston Marathon bombings. The DVD is not about the series itself but about how the team came together with the people of Boston and the USA to lift everyone up. Very moving at times and Big David Ortiz was amazing. All the players were amazing! Gotta have this video! It's really great! It's inspiring!,1466035200,2,461,4.435294117647059

6120040,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"This is a must-have for Red Sox fans and a better choice than the official MLB video. Not that the MLB disc is bad, but this NESN production is a more localized look at the Sox unexpected championship season. While nothing can match the drama and emotion of the DVD documenting the 2004 curse-breaking post-season, this video is an excellent memento of the 2013 team.",1415664000,3,367,4.661538461538462

6120047,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"After the 2004, 2007 and 2013 World Series wins NESN put out a video to highlight the season and playoffs.  The 2013 edition is by far the best.  Great content and very high production quality.  Highly recommended for any Red Sox fan.",1407283200,,234,4.523809523809524

6120056,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"As a Boston Red Sox fan the 2013 season of the Red Sox from the start i knew that the season that year was going to be different. This dvd tells the story of how a group of bearded brothers played as the great team myself and many Red Sox fans knew them as playing as.

6120060,5,B00GVFJ5PE,As should be expected this film deals mostly with the feeling and less with the facts. This is for us of the Red Sox Nation. Very well done.,1397001600,,140,4.035714285714286
6120061,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"I enjoyed the MLB take on the World Series, but NESN always does such a fabulous job with making local, while still appealing to the general audience.  The best thing is that the cover the whole season, unlike the MLB version, which only covers the World Series itself.  Great review of the season, and they always pick the best plays and sequences to show.",1395273600,,357,4.5625
6120062,5,B00GVFJ5PE,Great review of the 2013 for the Sox. Enjoyed watching it and like a fine wine it will only get better with age.,1394323200,2,112,3.9130434782608696

6120065,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"A great have-to for all redsox fans. It sums things up from last to first and there is a lot of great clips and storytelling by the players. Great to hear Kevin Millar. Of course one can do much more but you have to cut somewhere. I wish NESN Make a DVD with all the highlights of the year with full broadcasts of important innings in the seaon (for example the comebacks vs the Indians and Mariners, 8th inn Papi's GS etc.). Also a full ALCS 6 game DVD. It was crazier than the WS.",1393804800,,482,4.08421052631579

6120067,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"You can even hear what BIG PAPI said during the so commented dugout reunion that delivered the goods.  You get very close to the BOSOX, so close I felt I was right there along with the prophet (Don't let us win tonight) Kevin Millar who did an outstanding narration.  This is the extra stuff, the behind the scenes, from the World Series that we've been waiting for.  You'll get immersed in the drama and the suspense once again.  SUPERB!!!",1393372800,,440,4.531645569620253

6120071,5,B00GVFJ5PE,It was better than we expected.  More inside stories and facts and nice portrayal of individuals.  We are native Bostonians and BOSTON STRONG and to win the series just put a sweet spot on the end of a bitter year.,1391990400,4,214,4.325
6120072,5,B00GVFJ5PE,A must for any Red Sox fan!  For those of us who were long suffering fans in the years leading up to 2004 it takes multiple viewings of the championship season to believe they are truly happening. A great gift.,1391817600,,210,4.25
6120073,5,B00GVFJ5PE,"Narrated by beloved former Sox Kevin Millar. The best part about this DVD is the behind the scenes shots, the miked up players, the sound bites, the views from inside the clubhouse that you would never see otherwise. A must have for any Sox fan trying to get through the winter!",1391299200,8,278,4.470588235294118
