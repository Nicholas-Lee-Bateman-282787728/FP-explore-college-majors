1623723,4,B00005M1ZZ,"great .I was there also and if you were, this brought back some wonderful memories.  So much good music at such a wonderful event.  One DVD can't do it justice.  Hope there is a follow up.",1004313600,4,188,4.166666666666667
1623724,4,B00005M1ZZ,I was at this event and this dvd captures the video and sound perfectly. Shot with HD cameras this is a perfect looking concert. Only regret is that many of the stellar acts such as Paul Rodgers and Sammy Hagar were omitted. Maybe more to come in futre dvd's.,999561600,4,259,4.3061224489795915
7944603,1,B00005M1ZZ,Poor and unrecognizable performances.,1519430400,,37,8.5
7944604,5,B00005M1ZZ,These artists are at their peak in this Legendary concert. Man! Mickey Thomas and Grand Funk Railroad steal the show. Excellent quality digital dvd despite the fact it's 14 years old.,1399334400,,183,4.935483870967742
7944605,1,B00005M1ZZ,the editing was very bad and the preformaces where subpar not the best from some of rocks greatest i am surprised they have allowed the sale of this dvd.,1368489600,,153,4.310344827586207
7944606,4,B00005M1ZZ,"It's a great snippet of what the entire concert was, however, there was SO much great music there. I think it's a real shame no one released the ENTIRE concert or at least MORE of what was a great 4 days in Tennessee!",1127347200,4,217,4.069767441860465
7944607,5,B00005M1ZZ,"For those of you who grew up in the late 60's thru the 70s, this nice concert video might just hit the spot. Call me sentimental, but when Rare Earth finished their classic 70s megahit ""Get Ready"" and Firefall began performing ""You Are The Woman"", I couldn't help fighting back a tear. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but it was really nice to see these ""legends"" reach back and perform their hits. I mean, Mark Farner (Grand Funk Railroad) doing ""I'm Your Captain/Closer To My Home""...! 'nuff said.",1103068800,5,503,4.662921348314606
7944608,5,B00005M1ZZ,"ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE, ESPECIALMENTE PARA LOS CUARENTONES.
LA VERDAD ES DE QUE RECORDAR ES VIVIR.
NO SE LAMENTERAN SI LO VEN, ESTA MUY BUENO.
ADEMAS ES DIFICIL PODER JUNTAR TANTOS IDOLOS DEL ROCK CLASICO
EN UN LUGAR. DEBERIAN SEGUIR HACIENDOLO TAMBIEN CON OTROS GRUPOS
LEGENDARIOS. SIEMPRE HABRA MUCHA CLIENTELA DISPUESTA A COMPRARLOS.",1051401600,6,336,5.607843137254902
7944609,3,B00005M1ZZ,"I purchased this DVD, waiting for it for about a month, and expecting a big show of those 70's legends. Big names and excepcional songs. But when I watch the show, I feel that those great bands performed lightly with certain exceptions like John Kay & Steppewolf, and Rare Earth. The singer of Iron Butterfly was surely out of tune when singing their hit In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. I think Christopher Cross becomes too old to perform on public, except for those beautiful girls on Drums and Keyboard.
This DVD could be better produced.",1033689600,7,529,4.824175824175824
7944610,4,B00005M1ZZ,"THERE ARE VARIOUS ARTISTS FEATURED ON THIS DVD. HOWEVER, THESE PERFORMERS ARE VERY GOOD.
I'VE DEFINETELY SEEN BETTER, BUT THIS IS PRETTY GOOD STUFF. IT FEATURES A LOT OF GOOD MUSIC FROM THE 60'S AND 70'S.
ALL IN ALL, A PRETTY GOOD DVD!! SOUND IS GOOD IN 5.1 AND PICTURE IS OKAY TOO!!
YOU DECIDE.",1030406400,5,295,4.381818181818182
7944611,4,B00005M1ZZ,This is a high quality DVD;Performance wise and technically. It's about time that these acts were released on DVD. I hope that the producers get on the stick and release several DVDs showing much more of this Classic Rock.,1026604800,8,222,4.717948717948718
7944612,3,B00005M1ZZ,"This DVD could have been good, but the bands are great but the sound is so so. Its simply not mixed right and it makes the music sound somewhat week. There are a few high spots on the DVD Iron Butterfly, John Key, Rear Earth and Firefall all give good performances. But its all two short, this DVD could have been at least 60 minutes longer and it may have salvaged it, especially if they included more from the artists I mentioned. Also why are there Nelsons on this DVD, there not classic rock, Another highlight is Mark Farner (formerly of the Grand Funk Railroad) He is one of the best singers in rock and roll history and an excellent musician on lead guitar and keys. We get a fine rendition of the great Grand Funk Song I'm Your Captian/Closer To Home.  Styx is good hear as well, Chris Cross not rock n roll but cool, and starship is fine. On the plus side the DVD is beautifully shot, so it looks wonderful and I just wish they mixed it better. Its still worth getting of you are a fan!!!",1010534400,5,997,4.247368421052632
