1920485,4,B0000D0YX8,"While Dracula's Great Love has a few problems, I'm quite taken with this movie.  This Spanish vampire film from 1972 actually gives you blood flowing from open veins, a pretty Gothic atmosphere, lovely women running around in rather revealing clothing - sometimes licking blood off of one another, gratuitous nudity, and even one good virgin-whipping.  What's not to like?  Admittedly, the film is a little bit on the weird side, sort of coming unraveled a little bit during the final fifteen minutes, but the ending is nothing if not unpredictable.  I'm used to seeing Paul Naschy playing a werewolf, so it was nice to see him shed all that hair and try his hand at channeling Dracula; I imagine he enjoyed himself, as well, since vampires - not werewolves - get all the women.  As strange as it sounds, Dracula's Great Love is actually a rather tragic love story.

That story seems to take place somewhere around Borgo Pass, near the spot where Dracula was supposedly killed by Van Helsing.  We hear the whole story from a fellow who is traveling through the region, via stagecoach, with a bevy of lovely ladies wearing low-cut Victorian dresses.  Just about the time they pass by the creepy sanitorium on the hill (which one must assume is Dr. Seward's old stomping grounds), they lose a wheel, a horse kills the driver, and they have no choice but to seek refuge in the sanitorium.  They are greeted there by Dr. Wendell Marlow (Naschy), who seems rather charming to the ladies (except for the one scaredy-cat of the group).  Marlow, as it turns out, is actually Dracula, whose evil has survived his apparent death at the hands of Van Helsing.  In order to fully regain his great power, though, Dracula must win the human love of a virgin.  Gradually, our list of four candidates is wheedled down to one (but only after Dracula miscalculates and has a one-night stand with a woman who had obviously not been a virgin for a very long time - resulting in a rather awkward moment for our vampire).  Once the designated virgin falls in love with him, Dracula can not only restore his powers but also bring his daughter Rodna back to life.  (Please don't ask me where Rodna came from or what she is doing here, as I have no idea; we wouldn't have a virgin-whipping without her, though, so I vote we keep her.)  I thought I knew where this movie was heading, but the whole substance of the story took a rather dramatic turn toward the end - it's hard to explain exactly why, but it does make this movie a memorable one.

Paul Naschy isn't bad at all as a vampire, and the women are great, always eager to lick the blood off of half-naked female victims.  Their revealing wardrobes don't make much sense for the time period of the story, but they definitely add a little something to the film - it's called cleavage, to be exact.  Haydee Politoff is particularly easy on the eyes.  It's sort of a weird story, but Dracula's Great Love offers a most unusual take on the Dracula legend - I only wish I could talk about it without giving anything away.  In terms of the technical quality, there's no mistaking the fact that this movie, shot on 35mm film, hasn't been restored; the print is rather dark for the most part, the night scenes sometimes look as if they were shot during the day, and there seems to be something of a cropping issue with the opening credits.  Still, though, the look and feel of Dracula's Great Love really isn't all that bad.  The dubbing could be better, but it could also be a lot worse.

Naschy is something of a horror icon in his native Spain, and I have to say this is the best of the few Naschy movies I have seen thus far.  The story is grounded in the original Dracula of Stoker's creation but goes off in a most unusual direction, and that makes it a very interesting vampire film well worth watching.",1114214400,11,3832,4.528301886792453
1920486,2,B0000D0YX8,"In this 1972 film from Spanish director Javier Aguirre, four women and a man wreck their stagecoach and must take refuge in a nearby castle.  Unfortunately for the travelers, the castle's owner, Dr. Wendell Marlow (Paul Naschy), turns out to be none other than Count Dracula.  After Dracula falls in love with one of the women, she must decide whether to live eternally as Dracula's bride or reject him and continue to live as a mortal.  Her not-so-surprising choice leads to a strange and surprising ending.  Like a lot of '70s European horror movies, the film suffers from slow pacing and a somewhat muddled plot.  But there's lots of gothic atmosphere and a few creepy moments here and there to keep things interesting.
If there's anything to complain about, it's Sinema Diable's cheapo packaging.  For a mid-priced DVD like this, you'd expect to see a reasonably sharp video transfer and decent audio, but both are very marginal here.  In fact, the picture and sound quality are comparable to what you typically see in bargain-bin DVDs costing a third as much.  There are no extras, either, like a trailer or talent bios, which are almost always included in DVDs in this price range.  So I've deducted one full star for the low overall quality of the release.  Hopefully, we'll see a little more bang for the buck in Sinema Diable's future products.

Of course, if you're a Naschy fan, or just can't get enough of these low-budget Euro-horror films, these faults probably won't bother you too much.  Besides, until Anchor Bay or another company comes along with a better release, this may be your only chance to see this lesser-known, but worthwhile, entry in the Naschy catalog.
Two out of five stars.",1073779200,21,1706,4.824742268041237
1920487,3,B0000D0YX8,"I've been waiting a long time for a DVD release of this quintessential Naschy potboiler. Available in various truncated versions on VHS I waited with bated breath as I opened the package and popped it into the DVD player. The film is taken from a rather grainy print but it's not bad. The widescreen treatment clips some of the top and bottom of the film itself.  Surprisingly it is the most complete version of the film I have seen-lots of nudity (PG) and all gore intact. The main problem is the dubbing. The  entire soundtrack sync is off just enough to be noticeable and the English speaking actors sound like  the cast of a small town community theater group. There was no attempt to remotely sync up the dialogue with what is happening on the screen. Add to this a threadbare plot and you've got 83 minutes of pure Euro trash. I didn't say it's not enjoyable but beware. The quality and care of the DVD  prep work done on the recent Naschy ""Werewolf Daninsky"" series is miles above this release.",1069459200,7,1001,4.513812154696133
1920488,5,B0000D0YX8,The new blu-ray and dvd are of great quality. This print is amazing as well as the refreshed soundtrack. The extras are great and the insert booklet is very imformative and well put together. Vinegar Syndrome knocked this one out of the park.,1475798400,,242,4.651162790697675
1920489,3,B0000D0YX8,"An unfortunate carriage accident leaves four vulnerable young women stranded in the woods, but luckily for them, they are not but a stone's throw away from an old abandoned sanitarium that now serves as the home of Dr. Wendell Marlow, who continues to conduct his experiments within its walls. As night falls, however, the ladies each fall prey to the vampire who also stalks its grounds, but which of them will become COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE? In keeping with the Spanish traditions of the time, COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE is a sexy graveyard romp that is overflowing with misty corridors, moody slow-motion shots, and bursting bodices. Paul Naschy stars as the lovelorn Count who must sink his teeth in to virgin flesh in order to free himself of his ancient curse, but virgins can be so hard to come by... COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE is more enjoyable for its dark Gothic aesthetic and dreary sets than for its uninspired storytelling, but there are little bits that make this worth watching. As Dracula's brides beset the neighboring village, we are privy to more than a mouthful of blood and spirited feasting as they prey upon the locals. The blood rites of Dracula's daughter also set the mood nicely. Naschy is slightly subdued in his performance of Dracula, which is a considerable change of pace from the snarling beast he has often portrayed as ""El Hombre Lobo."" Other than that, this is standard Gothic fare from the 1970's Spanish cycle.

1920490,2,B0000D0YX8,"For those unfamiliar with Paul Naschy, he was a Spanish filmmaker who in the 70's and 80's made a goodly number of horror films that brought a European senisibility to the standard Univerisal and Hammer fare.
 In Dracula's Great Love he portrays a vampire-and not just any vampire, but the Big D himself. The film concerns three women and one man who are stranded in the wilderness after an accident. They seek refuge in a strangly deserteed hospital,which is headed by a mysterious doctor(naschy)
 And thus begins the plot, what there is of it. Mostly it consists of the ladies wandering the corodors at night where one by one they are turned into vampires. That's about it until the end where Nasch revels himself as the head vampire. This movie has a by the numbers feel to it, completely lacking in anything that would lift it above any other such run of the mill efforts. The women get bare breasted fom time to time, but it's hardly enough to compensate for the film's slow pace.
 Any one who wishes to sample the best of Nasch should try Werewolf Vs. the Vampire Woman. While not a great film. it's at least livley. with competent script, acting and direction. Nasch's own acting in Dracula's Great Love is about as wooden as the stake which eventually pierces his heart.",1357516800,,1278,4.646017699115045
1920491,3,B0000D0YX8,The movie was just barely OK.  It was hard to pay attention to it.  Elvira's antics were more enjoyable than the movie.,1350777600,,119,4.363636363636363
1920492,3,B0000D0YX8,"Paul Naschy stars as the eeevil title character in COUNT DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE. He lives high in the mountains, in his crumbling, castle of solitude. Uh-oh, Drac's serenity is interrupted when a carriage full of young lasses arrives. Of course, it's not long before the gals have a nice, naked dip in the castle pool. Then, one of the Count's vampire buddies bites the lone male of the group, and a blood-sucking plague begins! Much nudity ensues, as The Prince of Darkness attempts to resurrect his daughter (he keeps her in the basement). The rest is a muddled mess that makes little sense. Still, there's something about this movie that I like...",1308528000,,648,4.794642857142857
1920493,1,B0000D0YX8,"I am amazed anyone could say this is a good movie. The plot is completely ridiculous and all over the place. Dracula spends half the movie trying to bring his daughter back to life, then in the space of two seconds he inexplicably changes his mind and dumps her in the canal. The first forty minutes seemed like a good setup, but the rest is just ridiculous. Elvira is usually good for a laugh, but this is one movie even she can't make worth suffering through.

The dubbing is indeed as bad as everyone says--a fight scene in which no one even remotely connects fist to flesh is particularly hilarious. The guys swing at the air while one moans for no reason. It's like an Ed Wood film in Spanish. In fact, this Drac bears some resemblance to the Lugosi stand-in in PLAN 9.

Not even cheesy fun. Just boring. But yeah, for the guys, there are some topless women. And the single creative touch is what the mirror shows when Karen hits the sheets with Drac.",1269734400,,956,4.395480225988701
1920494,1,B0000D0YX8,"The movie is Ok, I'm not writing this to review the actual film but the DVD itself. The quality is terrible, especially for the price. You get a very, very bad transfer with awful colors and great loss of detail, but the biggest problem is that the thing seems to have been taken from a bootleg, filmed in an actual movie theater, as the screen is not complete! No matter what you do, you will never see the whole screen, and never is it more evident than in the credits where some words are cut. In the movie, some scenes just lack coherence because of this. For example, when Naschy first appears after opening the door of his Sanatorium to his visitors, we CAN'T SEE HIM because the screen is cut!!!

Terrible DVD. Wait for a decent release to buy this movie, which deserves the kind of treatment DEIMOS has given to Naschy's Werewolf films....",1215561600,3,847,4.464516129032258
1920495,5,B0000D0YX8,"I haven't seen Elvira since I was a teenager back in the early '80s, anxiously awaiting her cleavage...er, her appearance each weekend as she poked fun at some schlocky movie.  I really got a kick out of seeing her again.  I forgot how cool the opening and closing sequences were for her show.  I also forgot how extremely corny and cheesy some of her segments were.  She's got a ""Cooking with Elvira"" segment on here that takes corniness to new levels.

The movie itself wasn't too bad actually.  It's a Spanish film from the early '70s about four women and a man who are riding a horse-drawn carriage through the Transylvanian Alps in the summer.  A wheel falls off the carriage and wouldn't you know it, the only place that they can go for help is Count Dracula's castle.  Of course they don't know he's Count Dracula, they think he's a doctor.  So they spend a few nights there (help is a long way off).  Of course their numbers start dwindling rather quickly.  Unfortunately the second half of the movie seems to lose its way;  it just gets rather boring.  The ending comes as a bit of a surprise though - it's the first time I've ever seen a vampire do that!  Overall it has some nice Gothic atmosphere and I think just about every babe in here gets topless at one point or another.  They also wear these low-cut dresses throughout the whole movie that show off plenty of cleavage.

As far as the technical aspects, it's an old, unrestored print, but it's exactly what you would expect for a 30+ year old Spanish film being shown on Elvira's Movie Macabre.  It's perfectly watchable, and I was actually impressed that it looked as good as it did.  It was originally widescreen, but here we get it in fullscreen.  The opening credits now display the title as ""unt Dracula Great Love"".  The dubbing job is pretty bad, I've seen dialogue that was in better sync with the actors mouths during a Godzilla movie.  However, I didn't find it distracting at all.  The voice acting is sort of a mixed bag, Count Dracula comes off as about the most un-threatening vampire I've ever seen, but most of the other characters (save for one of the girls) is done quite well.  And this is the complete, unedited print of the movie, with all the nudity still intact.  Way to go Elvira!  You really do know how to show a guy a good time!

Overall, I really enjoyed this.  You have the option of watching the movie with or without Elvira, so not only are you getting the full cheesy show with ""The girl with the curves that'll rattle your nerves"", you're also getting a fairly descent print of a fairly enjoyable movie as well.",1159056000,24,2612,4.478813559322034
1920496,1,B0000D0YX8,"This is terrific Paul Naschy film, but my comments address the presentation of this DVD only.

This is a bootleg.  They ripped off Sinister Cinema's transfer and matted the opening minutes of the movie to cover up the Sinister watermark that is present for the opening sequences.

But....the only thing worse than the print itself was the sound. I had to keep turning the sound up then down as needed to either hear the movie or be blasted out of my chair, and at times the sound vanished altogether. The print itself was pretty good considering very few of these more ""obscure"" films are pristine but it too has some problems. I would have loved to give this one 4 stars but with the afore mentioned problems i cannot do so. On the other hand if you like Naschy and want a print of this movie you might want to buy one of these as the chances of another being released anytime soon is doublful.",1126051200,3,736,4.190140845070423

7999786,4,B0000D0YX8,"While watching this film I kept thinking how familiar it seemed. The further into it I got I finally realized that I had seen this movie years ago in a terrible format from a video vendor of public domain titles I won't name. Thats because it wasn't their fault, they were offering the best they could with the quality of the film they had on hand. Needless to say the quality of that film didn't help my enjoyment of it. So while watching it this time Im pleased to say the quality of this blu-ray release from Vinegar Syndrome made it a much better time.

The story follows 5 companions, one man and four women, traveling through the Carpathian Mountains when their carriage breaks down and loses a wheel. Imre (the man) and Marlene are secretly lovers and while they go in search of the wheel, the driver is killed by the horse. The group walks along in hopes of reaching a nearby castle now owned by Wendell Marlow (Paul Naschy) who in reality is Count Dracula. He makes the travelers welcome, feeds them and offers them shelter until someone can come and take them on their way.

Legend has it that Dracula can return to human form when a virgin offers her love to him willingly, an offering that will include making a blood sacrifice to bring back his deceased daughter as well. Of course this means that at least one of these women must be the love of his life and willing to do so. Unfortunately there are other vampires among the household and they begin picking off the guests who in turn set out to transform their friends as well. Along the way plenty of flesh is exposed, the typical Euro-horror inclusion of lesbian attraction between the female vampires, gore enough to satisfy those seeking it as long as they keep in mind the film was made in Spain and in 1973 and a lack of concern from the characters over the disappearance of their friends. And yetit works.

Part and parcel of the reason it works is the performances on display. Each of the actors here presents their character with enough conviction that they are believable as opposed to caricatures weve seen in other films. They do seem like friends, they do seem to care for one another (even if they don't question each others disappearances) and they offer performances that don't come across as low budget at all. Ive only come across Naschy in recent years (I know, forgive me) but each time I watch one of his films I see a passion for the genre that many tend to want to deviate from. Instead he embraces it. His performance here is one of the most subtle from him Ive seen.

All of this being said the true test of this release is how it looks. With all previous efforts to present this film have been severely lacking, offering washed out prints, visible scratches and a version from Elvira that included her performance as that character, I wondered what this version would look like. It was the first thing Ive seen from Vinegar Syndrome so I had no idea what to expect.

What I found was that this is a company that gets what fans want. Unlike those previous incarnations of this film this one was given star treatment with a transfer that is stunning to view. Gone are the washed out colors and scratches replaced by a crisp and clean print that fans will clamor for. Without those distractions the cinematography can now be appreciated and for the most part the film is well shot. If that wasn't enough, the disc comes with the inclusion of several extras including a commentary track with director Javier Aguirre and actor Paul Naschy, a video interview with actress Mirta Miller, both an English dub and Spanish language soundtracks, a still gallery, an 8 page booklet and reversible cover artwork.

Horror fans and Naschy fans will want to toss aside any of those previous releases of this film and add this one to their collection immediately. With any luck Vinegar Syndrome will find access to more films Naschy has done and release them in the quality format that they have here.",1477008000,,3974,4.566619915848527
