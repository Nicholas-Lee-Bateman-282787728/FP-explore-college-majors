5931839,5,B00EOUQMDQ,I used to watch this on television many times and hadn't seen it for a long time.  I've been looking for it but it did not exist on DVD.  I'm very glad 20th Century Fox made this available at last.,1399507200,2,197,3.9
5931840,3,B00EOUQMDQ,"The Sweet Ride is sort of like a Frankie and Annette beach movie, if you sucked all the fun out and inserted needless drama into the proceedings. It's an overly long, overly dramatic, and overly tepid movie that reeks of 1960s stink. Sometimes that's a good thing (most early James Bond movies have this same issue, but not to their detriment), and sometimes it's not. Case in point is The Sweet Ride, a movie so boring I fell asleep twice while watching it.

I was monumentally bored by The Sweet Ride. It has many problems, not the least of which is that director Harvey Hart (Dark Intruder) makes the entire concoction feel like a chintzy low-budget drama that was churned out rather quickly. I didn't connect to any of the characters' plights (even poor beaten Vickie) and just had little interest in how the movie would finally resolve all the drama between the characters. The whole endeavor feels like a rather tepid made-for-TV movie that never goes anywhere, with a screenplay (by Diamonds are Forever writer Tom Mankiewicz adapting William Murray's novel) that is DOA. There's a rape by a motorcycle gang, a woman being beaten by a Hollywood producer, and surfing. If I made any of that sound interesting, it's really, really not. The movie seemingly goes on forever, running almost two hours, which ends up being two hours too much.

The acting is rather bland throughout. The three main leadsMichael Sarrazin, Bob Denver, and Tony Francoisaall give only so-so performances. After having seen Paul Newman's Sometimes a Great Notion not too long ago, I can safely inform you that Sarrazin has done far better work than The Sweet Ride. Francisa just comes off as too smug and privileged, which may have been the point (but it makes his character nonetheless drastically unlikable). As for Bob Denverwell, the guy is just far too wed to the title character from Gilligan's Island for me to see much else. As for the female lead in Jacqueline Bisset, the woman's acting skills are questionable but good gravy she sure does she look good in a bathing suit.

The Sweet Ride is presented in 1.33:1 full frame (even though it starts out as a deceptively non-anamorphic widescreen picture). The image quality is decent for a film this old; there are moments of imperfection or wear, but they're not terrible. Overall it's a decent transfer to a movie that doesn't really deserve it. The soundtrack is presented in Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono in English. This is a very front heavy mix that doesn't have much in the way of dynamic range or fidelity. The biggest boost is during singer Dusty Springfield's opening song ""Sweet Ride."" No alternate soundtracks or subtitles are included on this disc. There are no bonus features.

5931841,2,B00EOUQMDQ,"This film, ""The Sweet Ride"" from 1967, as written by Tom Mankiewicz based on a novel by William Murray and directed by Harvey Hart (who made the superior ""Bus Riley's Back in Town"" in 1965) asks you to think of the dirtiest possibilities in presenting its story content.  That is not why I chose to watch this film and none of it was titillating to think about and like the film asks you to choose, I do not care about the negligence the film advocates, and therefore I give the film a low score.  The cast is very good: Michael Sarrazin, Jacqueline Biset, even Tony Franciosa (well past the age to act this way) Bob Denver, Michael Wilding and Michelle Carey among others.  Dusty Springfield sings the title song which I'd never heard before.  Produced by Joe Pasternak, responsible for some of Elvis's leering comedies.  Filmed in Panavision and Color by Deluxe, but this 20th Century Fox Cinema Archives edition is presented in pan & scan.",1386720000,9,942,4.650602409638554
8607621,3,B00EOUQMDQ,"This film had such potential, but ultimately goes nowhere! I looked forward to seeing footage of Moby Grape in its original incarnation. Also Bob Denver in a very non-Gilligan type role (as the womanizing Jazz musician!) but ultimately this film which coulda been a comedy, or a beach/biker film, or a drama with social overtones, ends up as a bummer. It is still a great document for the year 1967/68 LA/Sunset Strip culture (which was part of the reason I bought it!). The DVD(R) from Fox Cinema Archives, has no extras (except for a preview) and is pretty much ""plug & play"" when you watch it. I found this review from Vincent Canby in the New York Times from 1968;

""Sweet Ride' Begins Run
VINCENT CANBY
Published: June 13, 1968

TOWARD the end of 'The Sweet Ride', Jacqueline Bisset is raped by a psychotic cyclist and beaten by a television producer, and goes home to her family in Santa Barbara. Her fellow, Michael Sarrazin, abandons his life as a Malibu surfer to take a job in a hardware store. And Tony Franciosa, in whose beach pad the kids have been shacking up, suddenly sees the emptiness in his life as an aging tennis bum and feels fleeting remorse. Tears appear in his eyes, which, on the New Amsterdam Theater's screen, are about eight feet wide.""",1515283200,,1266,4.622222222222222
8607622,5,B00EOUQMDQ,I'm so surprised that Michael Sarrazin's career never really took off. A once in a generation actor. Perfect acting.,1509926400,,116,5.157894736842105
8607623,5,B00EOUQMDQ,"I had seen ""The Sweet Ride"" many years ago, and really loved it at the time. For some time, it wasn't available on DVD, so I was really pleased when it was. It holds up very well after all these years, which of course is not always the case. It has the bittersweet quality that I remember, and and the depiction of the hipster subculture feels authentic.",1506470400,,354,4.298507462686567
8607624,4,B00EOUQMDQ,"I saw this movie as a teen-ager and adored it!  I have a much different perspective on it so many years later, but it WAS nostalgic!",1501372800,,132,4.076923076923077
8607625,4,B00EOUQMDQ,Glad I found this long lost gem. Great movie about the carefree west coast beach bum life. Good acting all around. Bob Denver and Tony Franciosa are a scream. A live performance of Moby Grape and Skip Spence's guitar pyrotechnics add to a an already fine flick.,1490918400,,261,4.574468085106383
8607626,5,B00EOUQMDQ,Anything Michael Sarrazin did was fine by me.  So Michael & my fav sport(surfing)was WOW.  Wish I knew if he actually did the surf scenes though.,1473811200,,145,4.538461538461538

8607629,1,B00EOUQMDQ,"This isn't going to be a dime-store Ebert review--you can get enough of those all over the web--rather a warning and a condemnation of 20th Century Fox's Cinema Archive collection which once again PERSISTS in releasing their widescreen films in pan-and-scan fullscreen editions.  If you're comfortable paying top dollar for a dvd with no extras and in the wrong aspect ratio, then so be it, purchase away.  From me, this insult of a disc release gets just 1 star.",1423008000,18,463,4.848101265822785
