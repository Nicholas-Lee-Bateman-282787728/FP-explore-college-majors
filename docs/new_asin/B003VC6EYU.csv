8406650,1,B003VC6EYU,Was not what I expected. What was written as included was really not what this was all about. Confusing marketing but yet still a good cd.,1397260800,,138,4.346153846153846
8406651,2,B003VC6EYU,"Bought this DVD for my Mahalia Jackson collection. And much to my dismay, there were only 2 very brief segments devoted to the Greatest MJ (not the KOP). To add insult to injury, both segments showed the identical performance; NOT the performance on the cover at all. Very misleading cover. Other gospel artists were great but I purchased this b/c of Mahalia. Beware.",1305763200,,367,4.841269841269841
