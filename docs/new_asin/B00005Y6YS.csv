1675632,4,B00005Y6YS,"Here's an Italian horror flick that's a cut above the rest.  It's not as corny as most of the films in the genre(though it is still a bit corny), but the actors pull it off nicely.  Of course we've got Giovanni Radice, who once again is great in his offbeat performance.  As you probably know already, John Saxon(a fantastic actor not given his due) was lured into this one, and it's very amusing to see him in this kind of film.  I think this film is hyped up to be alot gorier than it actually is(the notorious ""sewer shootout"", while cool and all, just isn't as gruesome as you're led to believe), though the violence is executed nicely here.  As opposed to Fulci, who's violence is very slow and drawn out, this film's violence is quick, realistic and frantic.  Also, the film's star isn't the gore or violence, but the strength of the performances and story, which is rare for this kind of thing.  There are long stretches without any violence at all, and in my eyes, wasn't at all boring.  Usually in this kind of flick, you couldn't care less about the characters and their problems.....you just want to get on with the gore man!  You want the impalements and the cannibal feasts and the moldy, cruddy zombies blown to smithereens!  Well, Cannibal Apocalypse is a truly standout flick that combines the best of both worlds.",1050796800,7,1330,4.5738396624472575
1675633,4,B00005Y6YS,"When I first got Cannibal Apocalypse on DVD, I did not know what to expect because I only saw reviews about it.  But when I saw it for the first time, I thought it was a good movie, but why name it Cannibal Apocalypse?  There were a few scenes that showed the infected soldiers bite people, but they mostly used their hands or weapons to kill people.  Other than that, it was a good movie.  Also, it is worth it checking the extras that come along with the movie, especially Cannibal Apocalypse Redux.  It interviews two of the stars and the director about how the movie was handled and so forth, especially the part that Quentin Tarantino thinks of this as one of his favorite movies ever.  Also, it shows an alternate version of the movie that was edited on video here in the US.  However, if you want the check out the Butchering of Cannibal Apocalypse option, you might want to come closer to read the text because of its small print.

Like Bukowski's demise... I've had this DVD for five days and I already watched it three times, from beginning to end!
I definetly reccomend this for splatter/action fans and horror completists.

Or you can keep it for nostalgia's sake. Whatever the case may be, Cannibal Apocalypse is a definite must-buy. Starring B-movie legend John Saxon and Italian horror boy Giovani Radice aka John Morghen, C.A. tells the tale of a Vietvet (Saxon) who during his stint killing is bitten by ol' Johnny who is trapped in a tiger trap gnawing on some poor fool. Flash foward to Atlanta, Saxon returns to his normal life after the war and just as luck would have it, Morghen shows up and the two embark on a cannabalistic murder spree.

1675668,5,B00005Y6YS,"I'm a huge fan of Italian director Antonio Margheriti, aka Anthony M. Dawson, even though I haven't seen very many of his films. How can this be? Because the ones I have seen revel in low budget schlocky glory. Margheriti is responsible for such classics as ""Alien From the Deep,"" ""Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye,"" and ""Killer Fish."" He's also the man who brought us several highly entertaining shoot 'em up action/war films, films like ""Indio,"" ""Indio 2,"" ""Tiger Joe,"" ""The Last Hunter,"" ""The Hunters of the Golden Cobra,"" and ""Ark of the Sun God."" If you need any additional evidence pointing to Dawson's relevancy in the realm of low budget cult classics, he directed the catastrophic ""Yor, the Hunter from the Future."" If you've seen this disaster, you know how important Margheriti is to lovers of cheese cinema! I'm dying to see all of these films--and a few others--arrive on DVD. Until then, I'm contenting myself with the precious few of this director's earlier movies that have come out, or are soon to come out, on disc: ""Castle of Blood,"" ""The Virgin of Nuremberg,"" and ""Cannibal Apocalypse"" among them. Now it's time to review that last film. Woo Hoo!

Margheriti's contribution to the Italian cannibal craze stars veteran actor John Saxon as Norman Hopper, a Vietnam War veteran currently doing his best to forget the atrocities he took part in as a soldier. He lives a pretty simple life with his wife Jane (Elizabeth Turner) in Atlanta, Georgia. His biggest problem in a post-war existence revolves around dealing with a flirty neighbor, Mary (Cinzia De Carolis), until his past comes calling in the form of two fellow soldiers carrying a horrible secret. As the opening sequences of the film show us, Hopper conducted a raid into enemy territory in order to save two prisoners of war. These men, Charlie Bukowski (John Morghen) and Tom Thompson (Tony King), are just now earning their release papers from a mental institution. Why were they locked up after the war? Oh, just your usual run of the mill combat induced cannibalism! The two men consumed a few villagers during that raid back in the day, and one of them even took a hunk out of Norman Hopper. Now Charlie's calling up Norm for a few drinks and some serious reminiscing about good old times. Hopper wants none of it. Yeah, like he's going to get off that easy!

Bukowski and Thompson, as becomes obviously clear in a matter of minutes, failed to receive the necessary treatment at the VA hospital. They're soon racing around Atlanta doing what cannibals do best--tearing chunks out of people. The film mostly focuses on Charlie as he runs amok. He attacks a woman in a movie theater, goes on a very public rampage immediately thereafter, and finally heads back to the laughing academy after a public shootout with the police. Hopper, who arrived on the scene to try and talk Charlie into surrendering, also heads for the asylum. Why? Because he's suddenly coming down with a serious desire to eat human flesh! You can't make this stuff up, folks. Well, actually they did, but you get the idea. The ridiculousness ramps up to obscene levels when Hopper succumbs to his deadly urges and joins up with his former comrades for a gory rampage through the city. Pursued by the police, the three men--along with a few recent recruits--head into the city's sewer system in an effort to evade capture. The authorities must stop these guys at all costs. If they fail, millions of people could fall prey to whatever force is causing the cannibalism.

The movie explains that the cannibalism we see on display comes from a virus, which is an extraordinarily goofy explanation but one that Margheriti milks for all its worth. The director, along with scriptwriter Dardano Sacchetti, seem to be saying that violence is a contagious disease that we can cure if only we have the right tools. Sure. Whatever. I, and my fellow gore fans, could care less about theories on the nature of violence. We're watching ""Cannibal Apocalypse"" in order to witness bloody carnage, and thankfully the movie delivers in spades. It's not as cringe worthy as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or the other man eats man flicks that came out at the same time, but it comes close with several scenes sure to leave a greasy residue on the viewer's mind. A trio of examples includes a devastating shotgun killing, a scene where the principals convert some dolt's leg into beef jerky, and a nice flamethrower sequence. Nice! That's not all we get here, though. Expect to see plenty of flesh tearing fun as the cannibals cruise the streets and alleys of Atlanta. Less impressive is pretty much everything else, although Saxon and Morghen do good work in their respective roles. Cinzia De Carolis is nice looking, too.

""Cannibal Apocalypse"" comes to DVD with a boatload of supplements sure to keep the discerning gorehound/exploitation fan happy. The primary feature is a documentary boasting interviews with the late Margheriti, John Morghen, and John Saxon. They bring up all sorts of pertinent information concerning this sleaze classic. Another featurette takes us on a tour of the Atlanta locations used in the film shoot. Several trailers for the film, a stills gallery, an alternate opening sequence, poster art, an article on the film's battles with censorship, liner notes, and cast and crew filmographies round out the disc. If you look closely, you'll also discover some easter eggs that provide a few more trailers. Image did a great job restoring the film for DVD. The picture quality is excellent. I'm sitting there watching the film and it looks like someone shot it last year instead of in the early 1980s. It looks that good. The sleazy aspects of the film coupled with the stellar DVD presentation richly deserve the five stars I'm giving it. Highly recommended.",1179878400,,5804,4.8655207280080885
1675669,3,B00005Y6YS,"i had very high hopes when i bought cannibal apocalypses. after watching it i have to say that i am kinda dissapointed. the movie is about a group of vietnam vets infected with some disease that makes them act out violently and crave human flesh. the virus is spread by a scratch or a bite. two of the 3 vets were forced to eat human flesh to survive and thats how the whole mess gets started. the other vet who was the captian got bitten in nam, so now hes a cannibal to. the group infects a female doctor and then flee from the police for the remainder of the film. the biggest dissapointment was the lack of gore. there are only 2 real gory scenes and by the time they occur, your minds already shifted from expecting gore to expecting action. i have to say that the film is resonably enjoyable if you don't go into it expecting a gory horror film. the action scenes and shootouts are pretty intense. the acting is pretty well done. im not saying that john saxon is a magnificent actor, but he is pretty good in this movie. giovanni lombardo radices performance is excelent though. he is one of my favorite actors. he has a pathetic, innocent yet evil look to him that i absolutly love to see when acting. overall, cannibal apocalypse is kinda enjoyable, but the lack of gore an also some dull moments keep it from truly shining. worth being in your dvd collection.",1165795200,,1368,4.389763779527559
1675670,4,B00005Y6YS,"To be honest I really wasn't expecting much from Cannibal Apocalypse, while I was expecting at least a fairly decent movie it came out much better than I thought.

I liked the fact this is set in a city rather than the jungle like most cannibal flicks it was a nice change of pace. The one thing about this movie that really stands out is it plays out more in the style of a zombie flick.

If one of the cannibals bites someone and they survive that person in turn becomes a cannibal. They aren't just mindless people walking around killing people, but they suddenly have this urge for human flesh.

The cast is solid led by cult actors John Saxon and Giovanni Lombardo Radice (under the name John Morghen).

While there are some silly moments there weren't as many as I thought there would be.

For those into these movies you should know what to expect and odds are you will like what you see.

Cult director Antonio Margheriti directed cannibal Apocalypse and also co-wrote the script. He used the alias Anthony M. Dawson for both; even though I have heard of him up until this point I don't believe I have seen his work. But I do know whom Dardano Sacchetti is who co-wrote the screenplay under the name Jimmy Gould.

Besides being a fan of Italian horror the main reason I wanted to see this was because of John Saxon, Giovanni Lombardo Radice and of course with Dardano Sacchetti writing that peaked my interest as well.

Like a lot of these movies not everything is explained. In the opening in a dream/flashback scene of the Vietnam War what made Radice and Tony King cannibals?

Why if you are bitten by a cannibal do you become one? We never really find out, but I suppose it really doesn't matter.

The gore scenes are pretty good, but there really aren't that many. While there are a few it's rather tame to a lot of cannibal flicks and what was coming out of Italy at this time.

That's not to say Cannibal Apocalypse isn't gory, but don't go in expecting City of the Living Dead.

A lot of the movie deals with John Saxon fighting the urge to become a cannibal after he was bit in Nam. Funny thing is though Nam has been over for sometime and if he was able to fight the urge that whole time why would he suddenly give in?

Again it really doesn't matter, but I had to bring it up. For those not really into Italian horror or cannibal flicks odds are you won't enjoy this, but if you are reading this you are probably a fan and I think you will enjoy this.

Cannibal Apocalypse may not be a great movie, but it gets the job done and entertains the viewer.

Also despite Amazon listing this as R, it is the Unrated version.",1164758400,,2636,4.340122199592668
1675671,5,B00005Y6YS,"It's about time an uncut version of this flick was made available. I first saw this movie on the big screen in the early 80s when I was stationed in the Phillipines. Over there they had cut out the nude scenes but left the gore, violence, and the foul language intact. A few years later I bought a VHS copy of this movie under the title 'Invasion of the Flesh Hunters'and couldn't wait to get home to watch it. But boy was I disappointed. The nude scenes were there, but they cut out the gore! Holy censorship, Batman!

A few months ago, I got this edition, and this is definitely the one to get! I totally recommend this to all the blood'n'guts fans out there. Anyone who still has a copy of 'Ivasion' sould chuck it and get this. TODAY!",1163203200,,738,4.271428571428571
1675672,2,B00005Y6YS,"This movie was kinda boring. I was looking for cannibal holocaust, but wasn't sure of the name. This movie had a couple of OK parts, but get cannibal holocaust it's much better than this film.",1163030400,,192,4.514285714285714
1675673,3,B00005Y6YS,"The Italian cannibal film can be divided into two categories: zombies (Zombie, Night of the Zombies -- the latter not to be confused with the Nazi zombie film of the same title), and non-zombies (Make Them Die Slowly, Grim Reaper). Invasion of the Flesh Hunters features non-zombie cannibals. Mortals compelled to eat human flesh by a virus that's contracted when one is bitten by an infected cannibal. Much like spreading lycanthropy, vampirism, or the murderous nymphomania in Cronenberg's They Came From Within (aka Shivers, Frissons, The Parasite Murders).

Invasion of the Flesh Hunters (aka Cannibal Apocalypse) opens in Vietnam with the prolific John Saxon leading an assault on the enemy (NVA or VC, I'm not sure). A cheesy battle scene with extras running about aimlessly, flinging their guns while dying theatrically amidst fiery explosions. One enemy woman is set aflame in her cleanly pressed pajamas. All enemy pajamas look cleanly pressed and many things are set aflame, but mostly leaves. I don't think grenades can set tropical leaves aflame, but they seem to here, although there's also a flamethrower. Some of Saxon's troops carry M-16s, but Saxon holds what looks like an Israeli Uzi. The Vietnamese jungle looks like a Temperate Zone forest, and there's even a cave. The battle culminates when Saxon discovers two American POWs trapped in a pit -- eating an enemy woman.

Saxon wakes up, nightmare over. It's been many years since the war ended. So why his persistent hunger for human flesh?

Saxon's nightmare turns real when one of the POWs in his dream (and his former subordinate) phones with a request that they meet. Seems some vets contracted a cannibal virus in Nam, they're beginning to devour civilians, and soon the body count mounts.

The simple storyline follows Saxon's struggle to resist succumbing to his disease while aiding his infected comrades, all amidst the spreading rampage of flesh- hungry vets and civilians. Plot holes abound. Why does the cannibal nurse unstrap the cannibal vets rather than eat them in their state of helplessness? They're not zombies, after all, their flesh is still fresh albeit infected. And as in so many zombie films, one wonders why the cannibals only appear nibbled upon -- why weren't they consumed more thoroughly when previously attacked? Nor is it ever clear where Saxon intends to lead his men, or why they're traversing the sewers. They certainly never get anywhere.

The film ends with a familiar scene. The veteran calmly dons his old but pristine uniform before a mirror. His chest covered with medals. Finally, he polishes and loads his gun, preparing either for suicide or carnage.

Invasion of the Flesh Hunters is another horror film about the men ruined by Nam, returning home to inflict their pathologies on the civilians who sent them abroad, then discarded them. In Spaghetti Nightmares, director Margheriti expresses his own personal distaste for screen violence, and explains, ""My initial intention was to make a film which carried a sociological, anti-war message. I wasn't aiming at making a 'splatter' at all, but, in the end the producers, who wanted to copy the popular trend launched by Romero's Dawn of the Dead, had the last word.""

Magheriti works an old but reliable metaphor. The first explicit entry in this Vietnam horror subgenre, and a superior film, was 1972's Deathdream (aka, The Night Walk, Dead of Night, The Night Andy Came Home, The Veteran). Romero's Night of the Living Dead has also been interpreted as such, but its message was implicit. And in Jacob's Ladder the vets alone suffered the war's aftereffects, they themselves inflicting no harm on the civilian population.

It's always curious to see foreigners portray Americans in foreign films. The 1982 Italian futurist film, 1990: Bronx Warriors, is laughably entertaining for its incongruous juxtapositions, featuring white South Bronx gangstas mouthing lengthy Euro-existentialist speeches. Likewise, while Invasion of the Flesh Hunters is set in the US (it was filmed in Georgia and Italy), its biker gang dresses like trendy Euro-trash.

This being a European film, there is an illicit affair subplot and some trashy but bland music. John Saxon performs well, as do the supporting cannibals and shapely actresses. The jungle battle was cheesy, but the crazed-vet-in-a-stripmall- shootout (shades of Dawn of the Dead) and cannibal feasts should please gorehounds.

A respectable entry in Italy's cannibal cinema oeuvre.",1154736000,,4493,5.201936376210235
1675674,5,B00005Y6YS,"If you're looking for non-stop cannibalism gore munching, I don't think this will satisfy your appetite. There were only a few actual eating human parts and as for gore in general the two stand outs were a ridiculously huge shotgun blast right through a guy (yep, you see a bloody hole in him in all its gory detail, haha) and the other being a limb of a guy at a gas station getting sawed up into lots of meaty red pieces. Overall, the fantastic story about a disease from Vietnam compelling people to bite others, which infects others and results in an epidemic in the city, is cheese galore for guys that know how to appreciate b-movie madness. The acting is surprisingly good too, one of the dudes in the movie did an equally excellent job in House of the Edge of the Park a year later. He actually got a big gig this year too in the Omean re-make. Don't let all the negative reviews for this movie get to you if you're a b-movie fan, it's usually by someone expecting every movie to be as gory as Dead Alive.

Giovanni Lombardo Radice from ""City of the Living Dead"" and "" Cannibal Ferox"")has been in the mental hospital for long and has been released. Charlie does have some kind of curse or virus in him still from Vietnam for a taste of human flesh as he unexpectedly takes a bite of flesh out of a person, now he is running from the authorities but suddenly the cannibalistic curse or virus also hits Hopper and another former vietnam vet named Tom are now on a campaign for cannibalism in the city to spread their disease.

Interesting and disgusting mix of horror and action from the director of Castle of Blood Antonio Margheriti. What makes it work is that there is some nasty gore scenes like the infamous shotgun wound scene and eating chunks out of human flesh, a cool if cheesy funk soundtrack with a war theme that almost sounds like the theme to ""G.I. Joe"", a grisly twist in the end and the film is also a metaphore on how the horrors of vietnam can affect a soldier and this is one of Quentin Taratino's personal faves.

The DVD has some very good extras like a documentary with the cast and director discussing about the film, two trailers, a video tour on the locations in Atlanta where the movie was filmed, cast and crew filmographies, a booklet, poster and still gallery and a text essay on the censorship of this movie when it came out here in the U.S. plus there is a hidden easter egg in the extras menu if you hit left on the word menu to see a trailer to the notorious cannibal epic ""Cannibal Holocaust"" which should come on R1 DVD sometime this year.

1675677,2,B00005Y6YS,"Cannibal Apocalypse (Antonio Margheriti, 1980)

Folks, I finally have the proof you need. Charles Bukowski may have been a drunk poet, but he was also... a flesh-eater!

Any film with a script by Dardano Sacchetti (Zombi 2) and directed by Antonio Margheriti (Andy Warhol's Dracula) is going to be either brilliant or brilliantly bad. While Cannibal Apocalypse does fall into the latter category, it's eminently watchable for the stupidity factor alone.

Poor John Saxon. He's made a lot of very, very bad movies over the years, but perhaps none have been so unmitigatedly awful as this. He plays an army sergeant who rescues two of his men from a Vietnamese POW camp, only to find they've turned into cannibals. Skip forward a few years. Saxon's character, Norman Hopper, is making horrible films like Atomic Cyborg and Hellmaster. No, wait; that was Saxon himself. Hopper is living in the suburbs with a trophy wife, Jane (Beyond the Door's Elizabeth Turner, in her final screen role), an even trophier girl next door, Mary, who wants to jump his bones (the stunning Cinzia de Carolis, of Virgin, Thy Name is Mary and Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails), and a whole boxful of bad memories of Vietnam. One of the guys he rescued, Charlie Bukowski (Giovanni Radice, recently in Gangs of New York), has gotten out of the VA hospital on furlough and gives Hopper a ring to see if he wants to grab a beer. Hopper is in the midst of fending off Mary's advances, he goes into a flashback, interesting things happen that end up with Bukowski in a shootout with the cops and a biker gang in an auction house of the storefront variety. (No, folks, you can't make stuff like this up. You have to see it to believe it.)

Originally released in the US heavily cut under the title Invasion of the Flesh Hunters, Cannibal Apocalypse has finally made it to DVD in its original, uncut state. Okay, so in 1980 some of this may have been a little out there, but (still, as of 2004) banned in England? Sometimes I really have to wonder. It's not that extreme, certainly not in the same league as Cannibal Ferox. And I don't think being silly and stupid is considered a reason to ban movies yet.

And silly and stupid this thing is, but in the most fun way possible. Definitely worth it to watch John Saxon's wildly veering between overacting and underacting, and the predictable but pulled-off-with-aplomb minor plot twist in the final scene. Lots of fun, and probably a movie around which one could build a creditable drinking game. **",1100131200,8,2516,4.683257918552036

This film does have some action and decent gore scenes.

I have always liked John Saxon ever since I was a kid because of Enter the Dragon.
He seems out of it in this movie, and the interview in the extras tells you exactly why.
He was going through a divorce and had 2 mortgages so he needed the money at the time.
Saxon had no idea what he was getting into, and after finding out what this film was, he regretted agreeing to it.
He has never seen the film to this day might I add LOL.
He asked not to be present during one of the main cannibal scenes too.
I think this film is pretty decent, and had a few nice gore scenes IE the shotgun wound.
For some reason ""John Morghen""s acting really annoyed me in this film. It was just plain bad.
Maybe it was cuz he was getting stoned with the young girl that wanted to get it on with Saxons character.
Morghen talks about her pulling out a joint and them getting ripped lol.

A mysterious plague is spreading that is causing people turn into cannibals. I highly recommend this movie. You won't be disappointed.",1379808000,,293,5.0
7956817,5,B00005Y6YS,"I saw this movie years ago unfortunately in a cut version, but now in this DVD release, the movie finally gets the publication he deserves. It's like a completly different movie with all scenes intact. If you like the old horror movies from the 70s and 80s, this is a must have! It's a typical italian movie shot in the USA sadly not so well known like the Fulci Zombie-Flicks but with the same actor who had his head drilled in ""Gates of Hell"". More like an insider's tip.",1374710400,,473,4.325842696629214
7956818,5,B00005Y6YS,"i love this film. i own a copy of it. anytime i get in the mood for a cannibal film ""lite-on-it's-feet"" i watch this one.there are others which go xxx over-the- top for those with iron stomaches (like mine). this is the only decent one i know of. (FOR YOUR SAFTY,or MOST IMPORTANTLY MINE,this site seems to think i can be way too outspoken at times)i won't tell you the titles of the other films. last i heard this film has recently been put out of print, what?!...not again!!! if this is true then i say HOW DARE YOU IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT! somebody bring it back!",1269648000,,562,4.3619047619047615
7956819,4,B00005Y6YS,"Key lime pie.  Spinach.  Tofu.  Goat cheese.  Caviar.  My mom's meatloaf.  Human flesh.
Some things are acquired tastes.  A few soldiers develop an appetite for cannibalism while fighting in Vietnam.  Not sure how, they just contracted the urge to eat people.  A war disease, of sorts.  War changes a man, but this metamorphosis was quite unexpected.

Tarantino fave Antonio Margheriti jumps on the cannibal bandwagon of the late 70's-early 80's.  He steers it a different direction though, instead of bloody bedlam in the jungle, these vampiresque savage chompers wreck havoc back in the city.  This stars some great horror regulars, most notably John Saxon(Black Christmas, Elm Street)

This has some nice stylized murders, plus a great gory scene with a circular saw.  But the death rate never gets to apocalyptic levels, I'm a little sad to say.  As far as cannibal films go, this is pretty tame.  Still, it's a worthy addition to a cannibal lovers film library.",1216080000,3,966,5.012658227848101
7956820,5,B00005Y6YS,"A former vietnam vet named Hopper (Played by John Saxton) has reoccuring nightmares about his times in vietnam as for now he's a married man and living a normal life like any other person. Two of his former soldier friends become infected by some strange virus that makes them hunger for flesh and go berserk in the city causing some mayhem even at a movie theater, Hopper even finds himself infected with the virus joining up with the cannibalistic soldiers to go on a spree of eating people..

Gory and violent Italian/Spanish  action horror thriller that also co-stars John Morghen whom is best known for roles in movies like ""House on The Edge of the Park"", ""City of the Living Dead"" and ""Cannibal Ferox"". The film came here to the United States in a cut version called ""Invasion of the Flesh-Hunters"" but now on DVD it's fully uncut and uncensored with the gore restored, sure there's not much in the plot but there is some good action sequences and some nasty gore effects like the buzz-saw slicing of someone's leg. Considered to be a personal favorite of Quentin Tarantino, the movie has grown to become a cult fave and is one of the better European horror flicks of the early 80's.

Most recommended.",1199664000,2,1209,4.666666666666667
7956821,4,B00005Y6YS,"Ok, I must admit that I was a bit let down by this movie. I mean, with a title like CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, I was expecting an all-out war between the flesh-eating hordes and their prey. Instead, we get a few hungry folks chomping on a few necks. John Saxon (A Nightmare On Elm Street, Black Christmas) is good enough as the Vietnam vet, plagued by flashbacks / nightmares about his anthropophagic military cohorts. The idea of a viral cannibalism, spreading like rabies (sort of like in Cronenberg's movie, Rabid) is creepy. I just wanted the promised apocalypse! Oh well, I did like the story, and will watch it again, now that I know what to expect...",1181692800,,651,4.620689655172414
