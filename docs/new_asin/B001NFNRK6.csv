8326655,1,B001NFNRK6,"This is a very poor disk.  First of all, the runtime is not 73 minutes as given, but 9 minutes, 34 seconds. That's right - you are paying $12.95 for about 9 and a half minutes of video.  And according to imdb, the runtime for ""Mabel's Busy Day"" should be around 16 minutes, so you may not even be getting all of the film. In addition, the quality of the picture is very poor. It is blurry, grainy, and distorted to the extent that it is almost unwatchable. If interested in this film, I would recommend you try to find it on a higher quality disk. I'm returning mine for a refund.",1248480000,2,580,4.169642857142857
