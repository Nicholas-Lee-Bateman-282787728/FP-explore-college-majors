8690516,1,B00Q5Q9LCQ,"Forty long years ago, I saw the lurid artwork for ""Crash!"" in a Phoenix newspaper.  Not since collecting ""Mars Attacks"" bubblegum cards had I beheld such a gleefully wanton artistic nightmare.  As you can see for yourself, there is a ""Car-mageddon"" exploding in almost 3D perspective with the fun details of a sexy woman hurtling through the windshield of an upside-down sedan while her guy friend ejects through an open driver's window  (a thrill which the cash-strapped movie never delivers).  Now that I lived through four decades recalling the exploitive artwork, I finally got the chance to see the movie which inspired it.  Believe me, it is more fun to look at the cover for ""Crash!"" than to sit through the movie.

Jose Ferrer, proving that owning an Oscar doesn't guarantee a career of only prestige films, plays a rich old guy with a big hacienda in St. Cecilia who is embittered at his pretty young wife (Sue Lyon) because he was crippled in a car accident in which she was the driver.  For somebody who is wheelchair-bound, he gets out of it plenty of times to stand and haul stuff around.  Sue stops at a flea market and buys a goofy-looking amulet from Reggie Nalder, the villainous-looking actor who is wasted in a bit part.  It develops that it's a representation of ""Akasa, a Hittite god of revenge and destruction.""  More like, a god of bargain-basement car-crash movies.  Jose has trained a Rottweiler to leap into Sue's Camaro and maul her into crashing her car.  Again, quite an accomplishment for a guy in a wheelchair.  Sue, her head all bandaged in a hospital bed, her eyes fire-engine red, clutches Akasa and makes her car crash and burn about 25 other cars, vans, and police cruisers, many of them flying and smashing like toys.  The purpose of all this mayhem is not made clear, but it takes the Camaro until the end of the movie to reckon with No Way Jose.

It's pretty easy to bash ""Crash!""  It seems like it was filmed on Super-8 stock, recorded on a kid's cassette recorder, and written with the logic of that person walking down the street arguing with themselves.  The plentiful car crashes look like what they are, gaudy stunts suited for a carnival.  Only with Sue Lyon's crash does it illustrate the pain and horror of the aftermath.  Mainly you just get a big mushrooming  fireball accompanied by the embarrassingly dated 1970's funky music score.  ""Crash!"" is probably best appreciated in a rowdy setting with friends, a case of beer, and a pizza.",1469145600,,2485,4.706018518518518
8690517,4,B00Q5Q9LCQ,"It's interesting to compare director/producer Charles Band's earlier films (this is his second effort; his first being LAST FOXTROT IN BURBANK [1973]) with his later ones (like THE GINGERDEAD MAN - 2005) to see how much he has progressed. The funny thing is that Band has done just the opposite, he has regressed, as his earlier films, such as this one, are much more entertaining and fun to watch. CRASH! is actually two films in one. It's partly about a possessed car that runs other cars off the road (causing fiery crashes) and partly a supernatural murder drama about a husband trying to knock-off his wife. The wife in question is Kim Denne (Sue Lyon; END OF THE WORLD - 1977), who we see walking around a flea market (in the parking area of a drive-in theater). She spots a weird one-eyed stone idol and buys it from a strange man (played by Reggie Nalder; MARK OF THE DEVIL - 1969), after talking him down in price. Kim's husband, Marc (Jose Ferrer; DRACULA'S DOG - 1978; BLOOD TIDE - 1982), is a bitter, jealous old man that keeps tabs on Kim's every move. He's never forgiven Kim for confining him to a wheelchair, the result of a car accident where Kim was behind the wheel. After their latest fight, Kim storms out of the house, attaches her newly-bought idol to her keychain and takes off in her car (a Hemi Cuda convertible), only to be attacked by Marc's vicious dog (who he trained just for this purpose) and getting into a terrible car accident. Confined to a hospital bed and in a coma (and still grasping the idol keychain in her hand), Marc must figure out a way to kill Kim before she wakes up and spills the beans. He sneaks into her hospital room undetected (!) and pulls out all her tubes and wires, which lets a stream of her blood trickle down on the idol in her hand. The idol, we will later find out, is the image of Akaza, the God of Vengeance. Oh, no. Luckily, Kim's life is saved by nurse Kathy (Leslie Parrish; THE GIANT SPIDER INVASION - 1975) and Dr. Greg Martin (John Ericson; FINAL MISSION - 1984). Kim (whose entire face is bandaged) makes a full recovery, but suffers from a bad case of amnesia. While all this drama is taking place, Kim's driverless car goes on a murder spree, killing innocent (?) motorists and destroying dozens of police cars, the possessed car always coming away without a scratch. Dr. Martin borrows Kim's idol and brings it to an expert on the subject, which just happens to be Marc Denne. This is not going to turn out well at all, is it? Marc finally gets his hands on Kim, locks her in the sauna and works out a foolproof alibi. Too bad that alibi left no room for a possessed car, as it chases the wheelchair-bound Marc outside and pushes him off a cliff, the car exploding on top of him.  This is a weird mixture of car chase/crash exploitation (which was very popular during the 70's) and supernatural possession genres (Director Elliott Silverstein would mine the same premise the following year with THE CAR). There's something spooky about a driverless car speeding down the highway, causing death and destruction, and director Charles Band spends much of the film showing the possessed car causing accident after accident, usually culminating in a car flying in slow-motion through the air, crashing through objects (like signs, buildings or other cars) and then exploding in a fireball. When the final edit was turned in, the running time must have come up a little short, because Band repeats every car crash a second time when Marc locks a possessed Kim in the sauna during the film's closing minutes. The film is a stunt-filled extravaganza, but there are a few creepy moments, too, such as when a possessed Kim (her eyes get all big and red) forces her husband's wheelchair to run over his attack dog over-and-over until it is dead. Though very little blood is spilled, CRASH! (also known as DEATH RIDE and AKAZA, THE GOD OF VENGEANCE) is an entertaining quickie that should please both action and horror fans. If Band spent more time making films like this and less time on killer dolls and puppets, his resume wouldn't be half as bad as it actually is. Also starring John Carradine (in his usual five minute cameo), Jerome Guardino, Paul Dubby and cult director John Hayes (MAMA'S DIRTY GIRLS - 1974). I don't think that this ever received a U.S. home video release, although it was released on British VHS label VCL (the print I viewed) and on German DVD under the title DRACULAS TODESRENNEN (""Dracula's Deathrace""). Now available on widescreen DVD from Full Moon Direct. Rated PG.",1418947200,5,4561,4.6239210850801475
8690518,4,B00Q5Q9LCQ,"4 stars is not for the movie itself (which is one star, but entertaining because of its ridiculous premise / execution) but because this rare film was A) finally released to DVD and B) the presentation of it is very good, which surprised me.  If you love crazy odd WTF movies from the 70s, then take CRASH! for a spin.",1418256000,3,318,4.3
