7877458,4,6304605536,"Although I can't help but love any Jeeves and Wooster episode, this one is  too strange not to be a disappointment. Sadly, the directors of this series  strayed far from the style of Ferdinand Fairfax and other early directors.  These ones are zany, contain too much physical comedy, and stray too far  from Wodehouse's writing. One interesting aspect of this episode is the  chance for Americans to see how the English percieve America - this episode  is based on the New York stories. Included in this episode are the noted  nerve specialist Sir Roderick Glossop and his overly sporty daughter  Honoria Glossop, Bingo Little, his uncle Lord Bittlesham, and some others.  In the episode Bertie tries to ward off Sir Roderick's attempts to set up a  marriage between Bertie and Honoria. Basically, this is the worst episode  of a wonderful series, so it's not too bad. Buy it!",968025600,,876,4.851351351351352
7877459,5,6304605536,"Although each Jeeves and Wooster episode is a real gem, ""Jeeves the  Matchmaker"" stands out as a masterpiece. The memorable Wodehouse  characters included in this episode are Bobbie Wickham (who is, as Bertie  says, ""chock-ful of both fizz and ginger""), Bingo Little (who is  in love AGAIN), Tuppy Glossop (who is single again after telling his fiance  - Bertie's cousin Angela - that she looked like a racoon in her new hat),  and Bingo's uncle, Lord Bittlesham -- plus a newcomer, a Irish Wolfhound  named Patrick. Although Bertie usually abhors the thought of marriage, in  this episode he decides that he is lonely and wants to marry Bobby Wickham.  However, Bertie changes his mind after a horrible experience he has at a  girl's school. While convincing his master that marriage is not a good idea  and that young girls are ""absolute fiends,"" Jeeves also finds  time to un-attach Tuppy from the clutches of a ""corn-fed"" country  girl while re-attaching him to Bertie's cousin Angela, while at the dame  time finding a way to break up Bingo's engagement to a tea shop waitress  named Mabel whom Jeeves wants to marry himself. If you want some good,  clean, hilarious fun that perfectly blends wit with physical comedy, I  highly recommend this, or any other, Jeeves and Wooster episode.",967939200,,1291,4.902777777777778
7877460,4,6304605536,"In this episode of Jeeves and Wooster, Jeeves steps out of his usual detached role and volunteers to live the nightlife to the full. This is not by choice, but because a friend of Bertie's is in trouble.
Rocky is a  reclusive poet living off his monthly allowance from his aunt, but auntie  wants the boy to write her letters telling of all the wonderful activities  that go on after dark in the Big Apple. Desperate to stay out of sight, he  begs Jeeves to go on the town for him and write a report which will be  forwarded on to his aunt. This backfires (of course) with hilarious results  in the usual Wodehouse tradition.
My favorite scene in this episode is  when Jeeves joins Bertie for a duet on the piano.",962496000,6,713,4.356060606060606
7877461,5,6304605536,"As with all the Jeeves and Wooster films this one is hilarious.  Bingo Little is back and has of course fallen in love...again.  This time the apple of his eye is the daughter of a Marxist communist working in Britain  to free the masses from the yoke of the evil aristocracy.  Bertie is  recruited to provide dinner and companionship and good references for the  always-penniless Bingo's latest cause.  Dinner means Jeeves must take the  role of equal with his master to convince the ""Party members"" of  the ruse.  It also means Bertie must cook and serve.  As with all PG  Wodehouse's ""Jeeves"" stories the plot thickens and thickens with  laughs and slapstick until your sides split.",943315200,7,685,4.801724137931035

To Bertie's indignation his aunt has led him there to meet a potential wife and her charming curet brother.... More is at foot and  this particular story has an excellent sub plot tieing in Jeeves niece and  Berties good friend ""Biffy"". As ever Jeeves provides the super  dry wit and a 'satisfactory conclusion to the proceedings'! BUY IT",931564800,,422,4.739726027397261
