8358233,3,B0029T6A22,It was a long and tedious movie. The acting was so-so and i couldn't believe the central characters hardly aged. They just could not face the moment of truth. Communal living never  worked.,1497657600,,189,4.7272727272727275
8358234,1,B0029T6A22,"A two hour and forty-six minute soap opera about dozens of people I didn't care about for even ONE minute. Not even for one SECOND.

A heavy, plodding, totally humorless and lifeless look at the most exciting and eventful 40 years in the history of the world. I refuse to believe it was as boring in France during those decades as this movie makes it seem.

I love France, the French language, French movies, and the charming, cranky, creatively self-centered French people who love their country so much that they sincerely believe it's the center of the world. They deserve better than this dead, stupid, catatonically boring, navel-gazing, leaden record of their recent history. They've made some fantastic movies, but this is not one of them.",1375574400,3,746,4.912698412698413
