4530926,3,B0052T1EFY,"This movie has nothing to do with any of the legends or stories about Sinbad.  Why, when movie makes produce such things, they can't give the main characters other names - Clyde and the Minotaur - for example, I've never figured out.  That said, for a cheesy movie with indifferent special effects and indifferent acting, it wasn't bad.  Not a great movie, true, but I can't say I regretted watching it.",1374019200,,403,4.647887323943662
4530927,1,B0052T1EFY,"I thought it would be different, but except for Sinbad, the rest of the actors, especially the Princess...and the girl with the horns who played the witch were terrible!",1373414400,,169,4.862068965517241
4530928,1,B0052T1EFY,"It was beyond lame, to the level of Howard the Duck, not worth seeing, and if you do Manu is always cool, and the lead girl is amazingly beautiful, but that is all that is good about this movie!",1372550400,,194,4.0
4530929,3,B0052T1EFY,"Apparently, people love to denounce ""Sinbad and Minotaur"" (2011) because it's clear that the actors learned their lines the same day their scenes were shot and the production was done at lightning speed. On top of this is a we're-not-taking-this-too-seriously air akin to the Indiana Jones sequels. The criticizers can't seem to get past these limitations to see what is, actually, a fun, rollicking Sinbad adventure in the manner of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Voyage-of-Sinbad/dp/0767847431/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sinbad-and-the-Eye-of-the-Tiger/dp/B001NK54VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger</a>,"" only much faster-paced.

Muscleman Manu Bennett would've made a better Sinbad if they had done something with his hair and maybe given him a goatee. As it is, he looks too much like a Jersey Shore hunk. Despite this, he nails the part and conveys the joie de vivre of Sinbad. In fact, one of the highlights of the film is the great joy of living portrayed by all the protagonists.

Another highlight is the great locations, shot in Queensland, Australia. There's a good variety of settings, like forests, rock outcroppings, deserts, the sea, and caves. Speaking of caves, some of the cave sets are pretty unconvincing, sort of like the original Star Trek TV series, but not so bad that it spoils the film. It's just part of the charm.

There's a nice smorgasbord of women as well, including a gorgeous belly dancer near the beginning and fleeing damsel with see-through attire, lol.

The villain (Steven Grives) is also strong with his gruesome cannibal/vampire sidekick.

The film runs 88 minutes.

BOTTOM LINE: If you can look past the fact that the actors essentially learned their lines the same day of shooting, this is a fun, thrilling Sinbad yarn filled with high adventure, swashbuckling, magic and beautiful women. Yeah, it's a throw-away flick, but aren't all Sinbad films, really? Besides, ""Sinbad and the Minotaur"" is the definition of joie de vivre; it's a good film for when you just want to turn off your brain and have a good time.

If it weren't for the overt negatives noted above I wouldn't hesitate to give it 4 Stars.

8454385,1,B0052T1EFY,This is not the original which is so much better. What the Fk?  I just got ripped off thinking this was the original.  This movie is a made for kiddie TV and the acting is like your church pageant play.  OMG- I'm really pissed.  Looks like more time was spent on the jacket for this rip off flick. Caves looked like garbage bags taped to walls...so unbelievable!,1448582400,,362,4.358208955223881

8454392,4,B0052T1EFY,"Good fun . I would have giving this an easy 5 star rating if the star Manu Bennett had been made to look Persian in any way , like long hair & charcoal around the eye's & maybe the classic Sinbad Goatee or even a turban. His acting is fine & I could tolerate a Persian adventurer battling a Greek monster. But They missed a golden opportunity to add a great Sinbad adventure to the list by adding more monsters for Sinbad to battle & making him look more Persian. Think of the time it took for Ray Harryhausen to make the monsters come to life in his three Sinbad movie's & even then he always had at least 5 creatures in each of his three Sinbad offerings!  With todays special effects & the same actors in this movie it could have easily been a 5 star rating had they just mimicked the Ray Harryhausen Charles Schneer formula!",1404950400,,828,4.2405063291139244
