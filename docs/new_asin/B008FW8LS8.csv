8527369,5,B008FW8LS8,"This DVD is a must for people to see!  There are so many chemicals in all of the cleaning products most people use, and they don't realize it.  It is an eye-opener!
Look under your kitchen sink, get out your household cleaners and read their ingredients.  This DVD points out extremely well what people are doing to keep themselves and their homes ""clean"" these days.  An excellent DVD!",1370563200,,386,4.632352941176471
