2692505,3,B000KJU1GY,"This was a great series!! However, buyer beware. My copy is missing Episode 3 on disk three(episode - WW2: Storming france). Although it is listed on the CD package, it is not on the CD itself, or the menu. I've encountered this type of thing before (not necessarily on ""History Channel"" items). We should expect the same problem will occur on other sets in the same run. Be sure to check your CDs immediately after purchase (I do as a general rule). I intend to return mine and wait a while for this problem to be worked out of the system. Highly recommended series apart from this ""technical glitch"". UPDATE JUNE 15, 2007. I PURCHASED A SECOND COPY OF THIS SET AND THE SAMR ISSUE WAS MISSING. DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG HERE!!!",1180742400,45,729,4.572519083969466

2692507,5,B000KJU1GY,"This series by the History Channel takes modern combat to a whole new level. From the bloody invasion of Iwo Jima to the house to house combat of Fallujah, Shootout brings the viewer into the center of battle. CGI animation begins each segment explaining the tactical situation before the combat begins. Live action shots portray the chaos of battle which is then punctuated with commentary from the actual soldiers who fought the engagement.

This collection is a must for any United States military enthusiast or for those wanting to glimpse what actual combat is like.",1171929600,13,571,5.010526315789473
2692508,4,B000KJU1GY,"A&E is releasing movies by the same name but I don't think it is the Gregory Peck Movie. Stay tuned till February and don't sign up to buy until you are sure it is the movie listed here.

Unfortunately, computers can't make decisions and I think Amazon has made a mistake here. Hope it is being reissued but I don't believe you will see it issued by A&E !",1168041600,2,355,4.144927536231884

It.",1365552000,,97,3.9
8157577,5,B000KJU1GY,"I didn't actually watch this show, since it was actually a gift. But my brother really enjoyed them, since he loves this show. Also, since I bought it from Amazon, it was a lot cheaper than if I had bought it in a store. Amazon usually has great prices on television series sets like these, so I always come to Amazon first. It arrived completely sealed and in record time like usual. Very pleased with my purchase!",1318377600,,415,4.402597402597403
8157578,4,B000KJU1GY,"If you are into guns, this DVD set has them for you.  Lots of reinactments, but interesting how different gunfights over the years played out.",1311033600,,142,4.68
8157579,5,B000KJU1GY,"Great History Channel series of shootouts ranging from WWII to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the incredible shootout in Los Angeles between police and 2 heavily armed bank robbers. Almost a steal at the price from Amazon!  If you enjoy documentaries about firearms and confrontations, I would highly recommend this DVD.",1302998400,,322,5.1923076923076925
8157580,5,B000KJU1GY,I got my videos quickly and they were factory sealed. They all played fine and I really enjoy watching REANACTMENTS of battles... you really get a feel for what soldiers do.,1240617600,,173,4.612903225806452
8157581,4,B000KJU1GY,"The Shootout box contains of 6 DVD disks each covering 3-4 different shootout events, from the Wild West to the present day events in Afghanistan and Iraq (the Wild West episode contains of many different gunfights). The movies are overall well made and contain reenactments mixed with simulations and live footage (when it's avaliable). You could argue that the military events especially those from Iraque and Afganistan events are overrepresented on the behalf of Law enforcement events, but I found the all programs interesting and I learned something I didn't already know from most of the different events.

One event that ought to be in the box and one that I missed is the FBI / Miami Dade County shootout and the impact it had on law enforcement protocol procedures and equipment.

The only thing that irritated me with the show was the fact that you get more then a little bit tired of all the repeating due to the program format with regard to commercial breaks. But if you're interested in current history och just in shootouts in general, buy this box!",1239062400,4,1065,4.814207650273224
8157582,5,B000KJU1GY,This was a great buy.  I got it for someone as a gift and they loved it!  Thanks for shipping it so quick!,1229904000,,106,3.5652173913043477
8157583,3,B000KJU1GY,"Overall, I like this series and I don't feel ripped off. At least, not entirely. Why? Because I apparently know far more about weapons than I'd like to admit, and this series added nothing to my gun acumen. The cover of the series shows a guy aiming a combat ready M4 carbine, and sure enough, you'll see all sorts of weapons, but that's about it. So, if you're a bit geeky about weapons, then this series might leave you empty. That said, the video has good coverage of engagements, big and small. Much like a 6 O'clock sports anchor, they have the advantage of hindsight and only need to call the shots based on records, history, and interviews. Use of 3D animation, and reenactments mixed with live footage are their tools. Live interviews really builds drama, some of which are gripping, and all are heartfelt. Maybe they should have focused on the interviews. Either way, war is a senseless way to prove your point, but when fights happen, this describes the devastation at a personal level.",1200614400,7,996,4.6647727272727275
