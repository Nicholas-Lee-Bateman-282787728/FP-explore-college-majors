4492381,3,B004X63S2E,"[...]  This adequate melodramatic film noir was originally released March 21, 1956 and starred hunky John Bromfield and the gorgeous Julie London in an amiable but not stellar performance. But for Julie London fans who have been looking to expand their collection of Julie's movies this is a must.

Covering similar territory to the classics ""Phantom Lady"" and ""The Big Clock,"" ""Crime Against Joe"" is a short little thriller involving a man accused of a murder that took place while he was sloshed, and has foggy memories of where he was and who he was with. The twist here is that he has a solid alibi who, for selfish reasons, won't come forward, and a false alibi from the woman who loves him (Julie's character) , which gets him off the hook long enough to investigate the crime himself. There's a lot of pseudo-psychological character motivation thrown in for good measure: the suspect is something of a mama's boy who suffers ""shell shock"" from the war; his alibi--a sleepwalker!--is at the mercy of her domineering father; and the climax  involves the hero and his girl breaking into high school files to look for evidence of handful of counter suspects. John Bromfield is a little too lightweight to be convincing as the railroaded drunken hero (and overacts the drunk scenes), while Julie London brings way  too much elegant aloofness and dignity for her role as a drive-in waitress named ""Slacks."" Henry Calvin--Seargeant Garcia in the old ""Zorro"" TV show--is surprisingly good in a rare dramatic role, and the rest of the cast operates pretty much on the level of any ""Perry Mason"" television episode. The film was shot in Tucson, Arizona, giving it a different noir feel. While anyone who cannot predict the identity of the real killer should stick to comedies, this is a not bad quickie crime drama.

But I liked it! I can't imagine wanting to buy the DVD, but it's certainly a worthwhile way to spend 70 minutes if you like old movies and can rent or stream it. Decent story that keeps you guessing.",1383004800,,269,4.294117647058823

8446303,4,B004X63S2E,"Struggling artist, Joe Manning (John Bromfield- REVENGE OF THE CREATURE, MANFISH, HOT CARS), goes out on a drinking binge, after a disappointing night of painting. His evening takes a bizarre turn when a sleepwalking woman (Patricia Blair- CAGE OF EVIL) crosses his path. From that point on, Joe's luck changes, and he gets mixed up in a murder. With the cops gathering evidence against him,  Joe sets out to prove his innocence, while tracking down the real killer. CRIME AGAINST JOE is an enjoyable crime drama / mystery from 1956. It has a nice twist at the end, and Bromfield is convincing as the title character. Co-stars the VERY beautiful Julie London, who would go on to be best known for her role as Dixie McCall on TV's EMERGENCY in the 70s...",1435622400,2,753,4.704545454545454
