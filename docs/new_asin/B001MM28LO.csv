8321511,3,B001MM28LO,"Awful movie, yet interesting to watch.  Perhapes it's because it not only has the great Shelly Winters in it, but it also contradicts it's self. The over all story is about hicks in the woods, and an african american singer, who breaks down in front of their motel. In the motel the yonger male (who wants to be a singer) is romantically involved with an older female (shelly winters). To make a very long story short the ""want to be singer"" rapes and holds captive the black singer. He wants her to help him in launching his career. At the same time Shelly Winters realizes she is loosing her man, and fights to get him back.

The movie is racist on varying levels for todays standards.

As I had stated earlier, the movie contradicts it's self (doesn't always make sense). For example, most of the men act prejeduice, yet they want to mary, and or screw the black woman. What?????
Also, the male (""want to be singer"") holds the lady captive. He keeps her locked up out of fear she'll escape, yet he takes her to a public place... and in his gaudy styled Elvis suit no less ??????? In ths scenario she has the chance to scream ""help me"", and run, yet she doesn't??????? What makes this scene even funnier is that you can hear people in the background talking/laughing, yet it's suppose to be a suspensful moment???????

The only reason I had bought this film was to see Shelly Winters. But even she can not save this film. Yet, there is something so irritating and interesting at the same time about this stupid movie. I can't fully explain it. I would recommend this movie for those who want to sit and watch a ""what the?"" kind of film. At times it will make you laugh (how dumb it can be), you'll feel embarassed for the cast for featuring in such a film, yet at the same time you realize that most of the actors are doing their best to create a perfomance.

This movie had a blended feel of other films such as: whatever happened to baby jane, and fight for your life...but a very low B rated sort of blend.

I gave it 3 stars because I haven't seen a good ""what the"" kind of film in a long time.",1295654400,,2100,4.330788804071247
