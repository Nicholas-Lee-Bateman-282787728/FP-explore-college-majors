1623293,5,B00005LWKP,"This made for German television epic story of several people attempting to help their friends, families, and loved ones escape from East Berlin to free West Berlin.  It is based on a true story, and in the DVD extras, you actually get to meet the real man responsible for the story in this film, whose name was slightly changed for the movie.

Popular German actor Heino Ferch gives a superb performance as the leader of a group of tunnel diggers, determined to get their loved ones out of the Communist side of Berlin, just after the Berlin Wall was built.  For Ferch's character, Harry, it's his beloved sister, for Harry's friend Matthis, it's his spouse, and for the young girl Fritzi, who the group are quite suspisious of, it's her fiance' who is currently building the wall, but desperately wants out.  There are many others helping, who don't necessarily have loved ones to help escape, including the American, Vic, who despite his leg injury, is just as determined as the rest, and even takes some of the biggest risks in the film.

The performances throughout the entire cast are top notch, and while there isn't a ton of action until the end, the tense atmosphere of the film really keeps you glued to the set.  The emotions in the film are high, and the bonds between  Harry and his sister, Lotte, and Matthis and his wife Carola, are so realistically portrayed, that it's easy to see why they are going through months and months of digging to get these people out.

The 167 minutes seem like they flew on by, and I could have gone on watching more of these intriguing characters.  It's better than any other spy or war thrillers released in any country over the last several years.  Hard to believe it was made for German TV, as it blows away several big screen productions.  The direction, cinematography, script, and choice of actors cannot be faulted, and the only fault would be if you miss this gripping film.",1140566400,48,1927,4.6382352941176475
1623294,5,B00005LWKP,"For all you fans of cold war movies and spy thrillers....look no further. This is the movie we've been waiting for. Set in Berlin in 1961-62 this film is intense and thrilling. The viewer doesn't know what's going to happen right up until the end. This ranks to me, as one of the top spy/espionage/thriller movies of all time, side by side with ""Day of the Jackal"". All Star performances all around by the cast....especially the three female leads. This is a MUST purchase.",1132185600,29,473,4.642857142857143
1623295,5,B00005LWKP,"It seems so long ago that there was actually a wall erected to prevent people from enjoying prosperity and democracy (and yet it wasn't) and that people were shot by guards who tried to cross this wall. Although the film focuses on a wide group of people who are attempting to cross to the West via an underground tunnel, there are several snippets from other instances of attempted and successful crosses. Aside from the central theme there is a secondary theme, which is of redemption. One of the ways that East Germany kept its rigid rule was by forcing (what seems like) every other citizen to spy on one another; it was very effective,yet sickening. In the film two individuals are forced to spy and betray their friends and relatives, yet at the last moment, redeem themselves and in this you definitely get the feeling that their acts of betrayal were not acts of evil but something that they were forced to do and loathed themselves for doing it.

I have two minor complaints about the film. One is that, aside from the fact that the government is disliked by the people trying to escape, the viewer does not get a feeling why leaving in East Germany was such a nightmare. The other is that the Stasi is not portrayed in its full fury; as far as the Stasi, think of the Gestapo to the 4th power.",1306281600,,1303,4.4978902953586495
1623296,5,B00005LWKP,"Germany has produced many excellent post-1989 movies and this 2001 movie is one example. Based on a true story from August 1961, this 2:45 hour movie is both suspenseful, thrilling and character-building.  Could it have been a little shorter?  Perhaps, but the long running time allows for the viewer to not only learn of the motives of each escapee for leaving East Berlin, but also to show the audience to what extremes the East German Stasi (state police)went to spy on its own citizens.

East German guards were ordered to shoot to kill anyone attempting to escape, and that is exactly what the guards did.  Even if it the sign of brutal death momentarily sickened some of the younger German guards.  At least 171 people lost their lives trying to escape East Berlin from 1961 to 1989.  The Wall separated families, destroyed dreams and created an entire generations whose lives were completely dictated and controlled by the state while West Berliners were able to live lives of wealth and pleasure.

The ""Making of the Tunnel"" scenes on the second disk are worthy a watch.  Directors and actors talk about their extensive research into their respective characters.  Costumes and props are as real as they can become to resemble a still very much bombed-up East Berlin.  Even the Berlin dialect is quite believable.

There is one short sex scene at around 1:30 hours.  Language can get heated in parts due to the frustration of digging a tunnel to West Berlin that the guards only too slowly discover.  The film is not too graphic, though, but viewer discretion is advised.

Viewers who enjoy this movie would also enjoy the following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-of-Others/dp/B000OVLBGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives of Others</a>",1283299200,,1799,5.288732394366197
1623297,5,B00005LWKP,"This is an excellent movie based on truth. The Soviets & East Germans built a wall in Berlin to ""keep the East Berliners safe from decadent capitalist ways"". Hundreds of East Germans died trying to escape East Berlin from 1961 to 1992. This is a story of a group of Germans living in West Berlin who helped others escape by tunnelling deep under the city streets to rescue fellow citizens & family from communist rule.

Yes, it has subtitles. There is very little ""action"" as you find in some Hollywood blockbusters. What it does have is drama, suspense, human dignity, betrayal, sacrifice, in short - all of the elements of human nature that are compelling and make good story telling.

I was lucky enough to visit East Berlin when there was a Wall, Check Point Charlie. Even being in the Soviet sector for a few hours created paranoia. Imagine living under a closed society. These brave people could not, nor would they and some paid with their lives to escape.

Highly recommended, very riviting movie that really captures the life during the Cold War, the evil and the good, the triumph and the losses. The bonus features are also intersting in that they show orginal footage of the rescue & tells of the efforts to create a realistic & suspensful film that relies on the story rather than explosions.",1263254400,,1305,4.689956331877729
1623298,5,B00005LWKP,"Recently watched by this reviewer for the first time following the movie ""As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me"" (see my review), the setting of which predates the true events of this movie by a dozen years or so, ""Der Tunnel"" looks at life during the Cold War from the perspective of families caught behind the newly-built Berlin Wall. Main character Harry Melchior (whose last name is interestingly enough the same as one of the three wise men of Christmas tradition), based on the real tunneler Hasso Herschel, the 1961 German swimming champ, flees East Berlin with the help of friends soon after the preliminary version of the Berlin Wall is set into place. Throughout the film (which is almost 3-hours in length), the building of the Berlin Wall serves as a backdrop, and this reviewer lamented as Harry is convinced that the wall is just a rumor upon hearing that it is going to be built, just a day before its initial construction. On a promise to his sister that he will return to free her, Harry spends the rest of the movie's duration to build a tunnel with the aid of a team led by an engineer friend from the basement of an abandoned building on the west side of the wall to another building on the east. Especially moving are the subplots in this film, which include the following of those who attempt but fail to escape to the West, those who unwillingly serve as informants to the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany, those led astray by the false promises of the newly established governing powers, and those willing to risk their lives freeing their loved ones from the clutches of Socialism. Extremely fast-paced with never a dull moment, the need to read the English subtitles was hardly noticed after the initial scenes of this German film.",1257033600,3,1759,4.623003194888179
1623299,5,B00005LWKP,"The Cold War history of Germany continues to rise through the political smoke screens and fears of two generations.  Films like this celebrate the normal people who won those small but important victories that sapped the Communist state.  After all, it was not just Western military determination and the Communist economic stupidity that doomed the East but the determination of normal people to escape or go around the rules of that society.

This film is one of those must sees for anyone wanting to learn of anguish of Germany from 1945 to the 1989.  A German man tries to reunite his family who are trapped on the other side of the Wall after he escapes.  He finally decides to dig a tunnel from the French sector hundreds of yards into East Germany and bring her and others out.  The movie follows the months of digging, planning,the parallel hunt by the Stasi, financial & engineering problems to the edge of the seat ending.

One thing I found truly amazing was the US media involvement.  A US network found out and offered to help finance the digging while keeping it secret from all but a handful of their own.  It's hard to believe sometimes that the media once used to have that capability of honor.

A good movie and one that had us looking for the site when in Berlin.  We had no luck but it was still fun hunting!",1254009600,,1328,4.53781512605042
1623300,4,B00005LWKP,Good product. Online didn't see it was a library copy.  Invoice indicated library copy had been listed among the comments.  Library copy should be first comment listed.,1252713600,,168,5.185185185185185
1623301,5,B00005LWKP,"As others have pointed out, this is one of a number of excellent German films. I won't recount the plot as a number have covered it in the reviews. In addition to the suspense of the story itself, I think the really interesting part of this movie are some of the other little details and trivia that you get to see such as the Stasi and their techniques, all of the little human dramas surrounding the division of Berlin, some facts about daily life in the GDR and life for people who had family on both sides and many other things that add to the film. I've read some books on this topic, and it seems as though this movie is based on a real story but also combines elements of other well-known stories that happened around the same same time. A lot of people with memory of the wall or an acquaintence with the history of it probably have a picture of the wall as it was in the 1980s in their minds, but the situation in 1961 when the wall first went up was different in some ways. In any case, even though this movie is long, it is very enjoyable and makes you want to know what will happen next. I would recommend seeing this movie first and then watching The Lives of Others to get a taste of the other end of the wall's history. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. You won't regret it.",1239753600,,1295,4.163346613545817
1623302,4,B00005LWKP,"The Bottom Line:

A solidly-made story of tunnels to freedom under the Berlin Wall, The Tunnel is probably a bit too long but it has good production values and some of Germany's top actors in a consistently-interesting, if not always engaging story.",1234051200,,249,4.928571428571429
1623303,5,B00005LWKP,"Film is based on a true story.  It is set in 1961-1962 after the GDR (German Democratic Republic) erected the Berlin Wall and closed the border between the communist and democratic parts of East and West Berlin.  Residents of East Berlin were barred from entering the west.  Harry Melchior, a German swimming champion, who fled to West Berlin, was determined to help his sister Lotte and her family escape.  Melchior and other passionate Germans on a similar mission of trying to get family or loved ones across -  plot and begin to execute on their action plan.

The movie's principal character, Heino Ferch, who plays Harry Melchior, is superb in his performance as the leader of the group of tunnel diggers - as are the other main characters who are well-casted and believable.  (Perhaps all just a bit too good looking to be believable but we'll give the director a pass on this one...)

The movie features terrific visual cinema in the digging of the tunnel and the enormity of the task - the dirt, the claustrophobia, the backsliding, the huge undertaking over months - which could all come apart with informant leaks or capture by the ongoing surveillance by the Secret Police.

Meanwhile, the Stasi (State Security) anticipates that the family members in East Berlin will look to join their family in the West so they are on constant surveillance and they work in their evil ways to turn family member on family member resulting in acts of betrayal, as well as heartbreak and courage.

The movie is long.  Almost 3 hours.  But the pace, plot, suspense and tension keep you fully engaged - - cheering on the main characters at the finish.  If you like films with griping suspense and ""good vs. evil"" story lines - you'll like this film.",1230336000,8,1743,4.731788079470198
1623304,5,B00005LWKP,"In August 13, 1961, the German Democratic Republic erected the Berlin Wall, closing the border between the communist and democratic parts, and demarcating East Berlin from West Berlin.  In barely ten days, residents of East Berlin were barred from entering West Berlin and every escape route had been blocked.  The film ""The Tunnel (Der Tunnel)"" depicts the story of Harry Melchior (played by an outstanding Heino Ferch), a swimming champ of the GDR, who fled to the West side and heroically came back through a tunnel to help his sister escape.  It is loosely based on the experiences of Hasso Herschel who, for many years, helped over a thousand people escape East Berlin.

One day before the wall's construction and aided by a disguise and a fake tourist passport, Harry enters West Berlin and hooks up with his best friend, Matthis, an engineer.  Together with several other men and later, a young woman, they dig a tunnel five meters deep and 145 meters long from the West to the East that will serve as an escape route for their families who were left behind.  Harry's goal is to get his sister, Lotte, and her daughter out.  Using picks, shovels and a jackhammer, their progress is slow and delayed by lack of funds.  By a stroke of luck, one of the crew strikes a deal with NBC, which at that time was filming in West Berlin.  In exchange for rights to film a documentary of the tunnel building and the eventual escape, NBC would fund the crew's operations.  I'll stop right here for to go further would be grossly unfair.

This is an intense and suspense-filled story that moves at rapid-fire pace, underscoring the urgency of the crew's task.  This is like ""Mission: Impossible"" without the gadgetry (or ""The Great Escape""), where one mistake could undo months of digging and timing the escape down to seconds could mean the difference between life or death.  There are many threats that could foil their plans--the danger of discovery by the Stasi (State Security), betrayals, logistics of tunneling with rudimentary tools, and orchestrating the escape of their families under the watchful eye of the East.  The film has its moments of grief and frustration, but also small triumphs along the way.  **(Possible Spoiler)** There's a particularly riveting and heartbreaking scene where their female crew member, Friederike, is on one side of the wall and her fiance, who was attempting to climb the wall, on another.  He's shot by the Stasi and bleeding to death, she talks to him from the other side.  This scene is shot from high up, emphasizing the helplessness of the German people amidst a political tragedy foisted on them.  **(End of Spoiler)**  There are also moments of brief joys such as when Harry and Friederike are dancing to 1960s German rock-and-roll, or when the crew celebrates their first Christmas together, hopeful that the Christmases to come will be with their families.

At 2 hours and 47 minutes, ""The Tunnel"" is a longer film than most, but there are no pointless fillers or tricks here.  Every scene contributed to a better understanding of the political and personal ramifications of the Berlin Wall.  The Wall, described as ""the most potent symbol of European division,"" and ""the defining achievement of socialism"" stood for twenty-eight years.  It's worth remembering how ordinary people, caught in a political maelstrom not of their making and beyond their control, can find in themselves the heroism and guts to save others.  This is a superbly-acted and powerful film with high production values that's well worth the viewing time.

1623305,4,B00005LWKP,"This was as though I had taken a time machine back to when the Berlin Wall was just being built in 1961. Now if you have a problem with subtitles be advised this is how you find out what they are talking about if you don't know German. I found it interesting as I have seen other films in black & white like ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" back around the time the wall first went up and a few years after. This is wonderfully created new color film about a championship swimmer from East German Republic or GDR, getting out on forged papers and then planning an escape for his sister and others and enlisting his friends help to dig a tunnel from West Berlin to East Berlin. Quite an immense job, especially with the highly suspicious police in East Berlin. A must see for anyone that enjoys a good drama or wants to know what it was like before Germany tore down the Berlin Wall. I highly recommend it. Good quality DVD and replayability. - C.

1623307,5,B00005LWKP,"This is a wonderful film about a true story. The production is excellent, the drama unrelenting, and the characters believable. The good and the bad in humanity is demonstrated by the heroic determination of Harry and friends, as well as by the flawed, compromised, but ultimately redeemed Carola and Theo. Highly recommended.

1623308,3,B00005LWKP,"In the 1960s there were dozens of tunnels dug underneath the Berlin Wall that was erected in August of 1961. This docu-drama tells the story of one of the first and more famous tunnels. Hasso Herschel (renamed Harry Melchior in the film) was a famous swimmer in East Germany who walked across Checkpoint Charlie in disguise and with a fake passport on August 26, 1961, just two weeks after the wall was built and he had become a national sports hero. Having spent four years in prison already, he had had enough. That much is made clear in the first fifteen minutes of the film. The next two hours-plus recount how he and his companions dug a tunnel 15-20 feet deep and 500 feet long back into East Germany, and then helped more than a thousand people escape to freedom in the next twenty years. Each person has their own story of fear, compromise, accommodation, regret, and bravery, including the ominous Stasi agent Herr Kruger. At 167 minutes this film is way too long, but it's a grim reminder of political oppression and the human will for freedom and family that it provokes.

1623309,5,B00005LWKP,"This terrific suspense-thriller is set in the early 1960s during the erection of the Berlin Wall and in simplest terms, it's about the building of a tunnel under that wall to make an escape route for East Germans wanting to cross over to the West. Beginning with a handful of men, digging under an abandoned building, they are eventually joined by others in a months-long project. Meanwhile, security forces on the Eastern side are doing all they can to find and put a stop to such efforts, and the result is a cat-and-mouse game that keeps you on the edge of your seat for over two hours. Along the way, there are betrayals, acts of courage, scenes of heartbreak and heroism. And if you have a hint of claustrophobia and a fear of being buried alive or drowned, the many scenes underground will have you squirming and taking deep breaths.

There are excellent performances all around, not the least of which is Heino Ferch as Harry, a champion swimmer who leads and inspires the group with a fierce determination. Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") as Mattich, the engineer, provides the brains of the operation. Among other key members of the group is a young woman, Fritzi, played by Nicolette Krebitz, who is trying to rescue her fiance from behind the wall. Crisis falls on the heels of crisis, and we watch to the end, never sure that the project will be a success. Without giving anything away, it can be said that the final half hour will have you breathless. A very well-made film, with a strong script and fine ensemble acting.",1197072000,5,1541,4.644688644688645

""The Tunnel"" ranks among the best of these.  Lots of familiar faces here to German film lovers - Sebastian Koch was playwright Georg Dreyman in Lives of Others; Heino Ferch was Albert Speer in Downfall (IMDB points out that Koch has also played Speer on-screen); Germany's most beautiful woman Alexandra Maria Lara (IMDB says she was ""ranked #1 in a list by tabloid 'Bild' searching the '50 most beautiful Germans of today' (28 April 2005)"") was Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge (she of the 'blind spot' -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blind-Spot-Hitler-s-Secretary/dp/B0000CABBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary</a>&nbsp;- in Downfall.  I'd never seen Nicolette Krebitz before, but she's the standout here, even amongst that stellar group.

Though I was reading sub-titles (which at times isolates you from truly connecting with a film) the actors were so passionate in the movie and so moving; giving their characters such realism, depth and life, I became completely emotionally involved in the movie from start to finish.

7944431,4,B00005LWKP,"I adore foreign films and especially adore films based upon historical fact and that have political undertones, such as this one. I think of a German films such as Goodbye Lenin, Other Peoples Lives or Downfall as being as near to perfection as I could want. This film is a story that is based upon historical fact and its central theme, escape from political tyranny. It should tick all the boxes, but somehow it just didn't. The overall acting was good, but could have been just that bit better. The main leads are played by Heino Ferch (Albert Speer in Downfall) and Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl Junge in Downfall). Watching these two act, all I could think of was Downfall and how they acted in much the same way in that film. I am sorry but for me, they just were not believable in this film.

The story itself is a fascinating one, escape to freedom, the effects of psychological torture and blackmail upon a populous that feels lost and trapped behind a wall. My main criticism of this film is that it is over long and I was getting very bored in places. It could just do with speeding up in places, especially the actual building of the tunnel. I am not saying this is a bad film, as it is not, but in certain places I feel the editor could have cut a bit of the detail and the two main actors performance could have been a bit more dynamic.

This is an interesting, historical, made for TV film, that is in parts, enthralling, sad and nerve racking. It is worth watching, but needs a bit of editing to speed it up.

However, I did not realise I had bought the German version and at first I thought to send it back, but my husband wishes to watch it again with the original language so he can brush up his German. So now I have to buy a third copy!

7944434,5,B00005LWKP,"It is August 1961, Berlin is divided and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) has decided that Western Imperialism and military aggression means that they have to protect East Berlin from the Capitalist wooing of the West. So they start to build a wall.

This is the story of Harry Melchior (Heino Ferch) who is a champion swimmer for the GDR but is one of the escapees who got out early when the wall was in its infancy. He has been imprisoned after the 1952 rising and has no love for the methods of East Germany. He has a sister and her family on the other side and once he gets to freedom, he joins a group of like minded Germans to get their friends and families out. They decide to go for the tunnel option as one of their number is an engineer and knows exactly how to do it.

This is quite an old film (2000) but I have only just got around to seeing it and it is one of those I should have seen yonks ago. The tension is palpable through out which is some achievement for a film that lasts 160 minutes. The acting is all superb and the claustrophobia of the tunnel is extraordinary.

There is also great attention to period detail from the cars to the music and I liked the queues for food that were typical of the Warsaw pact countries at this time, we also get references to the luxury of Trabant ownership!. With love interests, double crosses, action and bags of emotion this film has all points covered.  So for a great film set in Germany that is not about war (well not a warm one anyhow), you can't get much better than this, I thoroughly recommend.",1346889600,,1566,4.280405405405405

7944436,5,B00005LWKP,"Freiheit is much more than an exciting world. It's an ethic value that doesn't support parallel.

And its achievement is worth a life. Based on real events, this is a masterful chronicle about a bunch of brave and courageous people who decide by themselves to turn the impossible in possible, this is none other than the slogan that encourages the epic spirit.

To dig a tunnel of 5m. deep and 145 m. of underground extension, requires of a conviction iron and untamed attitude against all the odds.

Tense and absorbing drama superbly written, dazzlingly acted and better directed.

One of my top twenty movies of the decade.",1315094400,,626,4.822429906542056
