They are very entertaining and great people. They have come a long way and they have been making a name for themselves. So support them if you would like but the last review was uncalled for.",1240272000,,350,4.2388059701492535
8252891,2,B0013TR4HY,"This video might have been awesome back in '99, however to be released in late 2008 its just too little, too late.  The Jackass and CKY crew have done it all before and what hasn't been done there had been done in skateboarding, BMX and motocross videos years before. The stunts are all comparatively tame and the soundtrack was put together by some generic local metal band.  Some of the stunts performed in this video involve jumping from a ladder (no joke), trying to outrun a large barrel on its side rolling down a hill (a la Indiana Jones) and some guys doing wheelies on streetbikes with not-so-disastrous results since they weren't going too fast.  And to top it all off, all the white kids talking and acting like brought up in the streets hip hoppers is just embarrassing to watch.  The sooner all these suburban kids stop talking like ""they ballin' outta control"" and ""makin' it rain"" at strip clubs every weekend, the better.

The tagline to this video says ""Buy this DVD now and you will not regret it!"" well, I downloaded this video and I regretted it.  I realize I'll probably get voted down by the ""hella 3xtreme crazy kidz crew"" or whatever, but save your money.  This DVD is absolute garbage in every way (stunts, production, music), and by purchasing it you'll only be encouraging them to make more.",1239321600,3,1318,4.630901287553648
