8406100,5,B003UNPNP6,"I love The Nutcracker ballet but as we were unable to go see it this Christmas, I had to make do with a DVD.  I would have preferred the live performance by The Jofftrey Ballet but this is such a great DVD, it still felt like the holiday season.  The Bolshoi put on a superb dance that is more athletic but still incredibly graceful.  The costumes were appropriate to the story, being in the style of the late 1800's when the story takes place.  The dancers are incredibly graceful and the orchestra is outstanding.  My favorite is ""The Waltz of the Flowers"" and the musicians and dancers didn't disappoint.
I recommend this DVD whether you are an experienced ballet goer or a complete novice.  The only persons who might find fault are professionals and that probably would be envy.
On the whole it is a wonderful and magical performance to be enjoyed by the whole family.",1360800000,8,873,4.564102564102564
