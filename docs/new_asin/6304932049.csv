It is in most ways superior to them all. It has everything you could ever want in a film love, hate, little people, warlocks and witches, revenge, redemption, self sacrifice, need I say more! And it's funny too!
Treat yourself to this rare hong kong delight! Jackie who?",1027555200,2,436,4.602564102564102
8508260,3,6304932049,"This film is Part 2 in Kirk Wongs Police Trilogy (1-Police Story, 3-Rock N Roll Cop). For the most part this film was standard action fare, nothing spectacular, untill the end, which pulled out all the stops in a shootout  across a crowded HK shopping district, a pulse pounding soundtrack makes  this scene all the more exciting. Intriguing performances from Danny Lee,  Cecelia Yip and Anthony Wong(unusually restrained). I'll buy this one just  for the climax.",932688000,,463,5.052631578947368
