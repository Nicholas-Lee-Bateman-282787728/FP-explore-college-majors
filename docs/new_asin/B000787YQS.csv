8045758,5,B000787YQS,"""Morons from Outer Space"" is not a great movie but it has some great moments. At this price it's worth owning if you like absurd, sarcastic humor.

I am not much of a fan of ""Alien from LA""  but it's similar in tone and style.",1349481600,,226,4.0
8045759,5,B000787YQS,"Morons from Outer Space is a very funny movie. There are many obvious oversights if you're thinking this is a science fiction, but for those who are looking for a character based comedy, this is a great movie. What would happen if aliens were not the evil conquerers or the lost and lonely depicted in so many other science fiction movies? What if they were just vacationers who accidentally stumbled into another planet much like their own, but without the means of interstellar travel? It's interesting to note that a well-known English comedy duo of Mel Smith and Griffin Rhyss-Jones (Alas, Smith and Jones) are principal stars in this movie, but are never on screen at the same time until the very last scene. The comedy works well for both.

Also, almost completely overlooked in the frantic pace of the movie is the 'ugly American' depiction of almost every American character in this movie. Rednecks in Arizona, lazy workers at the Aerospace tracking station in Alaska (Yet another movie where the employees seem to have taken the job of space monitoring because you never have to do anything), crazed military personnel and entertainment-hungry citizens. Still, unless you're looking for it, (or, like me, until you've watched the movie a few times) you don't even notice that there are no normal Americans.

I suspect that Alien from LA was tacked on simply to give that movie some sales. Virtually no story or acting.",1339286400,,1427,4.892561983471074
