Great to hear this side of eating that many have ignored.",1415836800,,152,3.935483870967742
8250402,3,B0013E35H2,"There is a lot of information and inspiration in this book.  I resonate with a lot of what Gabriel Cousens has to say, and emanate.  I have been a little deterred by what I question as fully being accessible to others and walking the talk in a way that embraces the many who are curious and in need of healing their relationship with food and life as those are intricately connected, if not the same thing.  Lots of potent and insightful suggestions and there is a gentleness that is evident in his books.  If you are drawn to his books, I would recommend them, always making use of your own guidance and intuition to know which suggestions are right for you.",1313625600,,659,4.421487603305785
8250403,5,B0013E35H2,""" I have read many books and seen several DVDs on raw food, but really enjoyed this one. The recipes  were really easy to follow and I learned a lot of new information from the classes.""",1252195200,2,186,4.166666666666667
8250404,5,B0013E35H2,"I was lucky enough to meet a friend who introduced me to this wonderful DVD.
 It's 2 1/2 hours of inspiring information was so riveting I watched it five times. I'm not someone who is
into 'gurus' or believes in rigid lifestyle changes, but somehow suddenly everything made sense about
how I was living my life that was making me unhappy, and how a little insight could change everything.

I hadn't even though about doing yoga in over twenty years, but I'm studying it now with a true determination to make my life better. I'm standing taller, feeling stronger, and sleeping better at night.
 I'm convinced this is the safest way to do a real fast for the first time and am  planning my first supervised fast at the Tree of Life Nutrition Center.  And taking three friends with me!",1225843200,8,782,4.557142857142857
