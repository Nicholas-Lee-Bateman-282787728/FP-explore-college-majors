5185037,5,B008VF0XZ8,"Stella days tells the story of a priest of a small village that pushed to build a new church his town does NOT need, and instead starts work on a movie house he feels will bring the town together.

Martin Sheen, once again, gives a wonderful performance as the priest.  This film is just a sweet well written, well acted work.  Try to see it if you can!",1345507200,6,353,4.161764705882353

5185039,4,B008VF0XZ8,"Martin Sheen has landed a role that shows off his considerable talents in this small scale, sensitive and informed film from Tribeca.  Based on a novel by Michael Doorley adapted for the screen by Antoine O. Flatharta and directed with sensitivity by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, the story takes place in Ireland of 1956, and the film opens with an introduction to bringing electricity into a very small town whose people have done very well without the new-fangled things, thank you very much.

The priest of the town is Fr. Daniel Barry (Martin Sheen), a loving man who hears confessions, makes his rounds offering oils of last rites to please one elderly ill patient and caring for his flock in a very human manner, is a man of the World having the Church both in America and Rome, who has a passion for Cinema , Music and Language is left to languish in a rural community after being replaced in Rome by a younger priest with greater credentials for scholarship.  The Parish Bishop (Tom Hickey) has decided his parish needs a new, modern, concrete church and he burdens the parish priests to raise the funds for the project. There is a politician in the town - Brendan (Stephen Rea) - who vies for power with Fr. Barry, seeking political clout to reign in the filthy temptations of the world from his followers.  Fr. Barry, on the other hand, devises a method for raising funds (and catering to his love for picture shows) by building a cinema. He is supported by a new young schoolteacher Tim (Trystan Gravelle, a young Welsh actor of great potential) - Fr. Barry overrode Brendan, further alienating himself.  Tim finds room and board with a local young mother Elaine (Amy Huberman) whose alcoholic abusive husband is off to London leaving their young son Joey (Joseph O'Sllivan) without the nurturing of a father.  The tale pits the worldly priest against the power hungry fundamentalist politicians and the significant people of the story are at first injured and then find a manner of redemption.  In the end the `bringing of light' to the little town in Tipperary via electricity and modern times merely reveals a path for conscientious folk to escape it all.

The cast is very strong, the musical score by Nicholas Hooper, and the countryside of Ireland is gorgeous.  This is a little film with a big message that flies like a lark in the sky.  Try to catch it!  Grady Harp, June 12",1340668800,8,2385,4.709134615384615
5185040,3,B008VF0XZ8,"This is a nice little movie. Not great or life-changing. A little predictable. A little depressing. But, overall, pleasant enough.  We just wanted something free to watch on St. Patrick's Day until The Quite Man came on... and this filled the bill.",1364083200,,248,4.904761904761905

5185042,3,B008VF0XZ8,This is a very simple story of a priest who opens a cinema to raise money.  Nothing complex or deep here. Martin SHeen is good as usual and the rest of the cast does a good job also. This film is a good choice for a quiet pleasant evening but don't expect an engrossing movie.,1363305600,,276,4.0181818181818185
5185043,2,B008VF0XZ8,No subtitles and  so i could not understand much of the dialog.  Just went on amazon prime and it does not have subtitles available on most titles. No good for the hard of hearing.,1362873600,2,180,4.264705882352941
5185044,5,B008VF0XZ8,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the Dublin Film Festival and was really delighted. It's a lovely, heart warming, character-driven film. A refreshing change from todays big blockbuster films which neglect the personal touches a well written script provides. The perfect film to watch curled up on your sofa on a Sunday night. I'd thoroughly reccomend it!",1361923200,2,360,5.016666666666667
5185045,4,B008VF0XZ8,"I thought that Martin Sheen did a superb job in this movie.  I also liked the story.  I really cannot give you specifics, I just thought it was well done and I had an enjoyable time watching it.",1361836800,2,194,4.078947368421052

5185048,4,B008VF0XZ8,"This is another of what are often called ""small films"" - often by independent production companies but, as in this case, produced under the auspices (and funding) of a national film board (of which there is none in the US). ""Stella Days"" (the title refers to the name of the movie ""venue""  - THE STELLA - I won't call it a ""theater"" - that Martin Sheen , as a priest, wants to open in a small Irish village in 1956.) was produced by the Irish National Film Board (with some participation from Norway, if I remember in the opening credits.) Much of the cast is Irish though the American stars are Martin Sheen and Stephen Rea.). Sheen's accent is not as strong as the others and some of this is excused by giving his character a plot device where he lived in the US for 18 years, thus softening it.

I'll defer to the other reviewers here to give you more of the plot - though I watched this DVD with no advance preparation or knowledge - except to think, from the packaging, that it would be similar to 1988's ""Cinema Paradso"" (it isn't).  I enjoyed the film - as I like ""small films"" but thought it could have used some tighter editing (it still only runs 90 minutes). The ""side story"" of electricity just coming to homes in Ireland as late as 1956 was interesting but only tangential to the plot. What really surprised me was how the filmmakers approached the ""money-tizing"" of the Catholic Church. ""Bigger churches are better"", ""We need to raise building funds for a new church even though the old one is perfectly fine"" and how the church gets involved in politics. I'm not a Catholic and wonder how a religious Catholic would view this angle which is prominent in the film.

I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't put high on my ""must see"" list.

The DVdhas only one bonus: A three-minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette, which spends nearly the first minute with scenes from the film itself.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5185049,5,B008VF0XZ8,"I expected a decent film, given that it starred Martin Sheen, but Stella Days is a period piece with more depth and story than I even imagined! Having a priest wanting to buck the system back in the 1950s is unique, but Sheen pulls it off with a character that will have you rooting for his originality and constant frustration with the religious system. And Stephen Rea, as Sheen's nemesis, is the guy you will love to hate. I highly recommend ""Stella Days"" to all adult audiences.",1354579200,3,482,4.551724137931035

8530863,5,B008VF0XZ8,"The most accurate portrayal I have seen of life in a rural Irish village during the ""Rural Electrification Project"" of the early 1950s, when I was a teenager in north County Tipperary, in which this film is set. Excellent performances by Martin Sheen and Stephen Rea. Martin Sheen's Irish accent was convincing but largely forgotten in the development of his complex character. Not to be missed.",1441065600,,395,5.0
8530864,5,B008VF0XZ8,"Great and understated performance by Martin Sheen in this Irish indie about a priest who starts a movie theater in 1956 Ireland. Based on a memoir of the same name, this short 87-minute film manages to convey a lot of period detail about a rural Ireland that was just discovering electricity. Themes of faith, doubt, the old versus the new, domestic strife, and progress receive mature treatment in the movie. The always-excellent Stephen Rea plays a dour parishioner and local politician who tries to stop the ""Stella"" theater because of his fear that it will show ""American filth.""

At times, the film recalls ""Chocolat"" in its story of a backwater village transformed by innovations. However, this movie is far more subtle and sincere, lacking the cheerful paganism of that earlier picture. Sometimes the narrative is overly cluttered, as it tries to squeeze sub-plots about a young teacher and broken family into the mix. But Sheen's bravura performance as the dedicated priest who does his best to lead the community, for good and for ill, holds the elegiac film together.

Prudish and reactionary Catholics come off in a bad light in this film, but there are no cartoon heroes or villains, as director Thaddeus O'Sullivan (""Churchill"") prefers nuance to rabble-rousing. While Sheen's priest has good intentions, he also suffers from his own flaws, and his ambitious bishop also comes across as a uniquely balanced character. There is nothing here to offend either believers or non-believers, but there is much to ponder in a simple story of change and faith in 1950s Catholic Ireland.",1429228800,,1590,5.064885496183206
