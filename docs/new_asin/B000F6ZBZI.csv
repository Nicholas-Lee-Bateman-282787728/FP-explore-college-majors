8118250,5,B000F6ZBZI,"This is a very thorough documentary about former New York ""godfather"", Joseph Bonanno. I've seen lots of documentaries about mob people like Lucky Luciano, Al Capone etc. but this one is one of the best I've seen. If you've read Joseph Bonanno's autobiography, ""A Man Of Honor"", or his son Bill Bonanno's autobiography, ""Bound By Honor"", then this documentary is a must. It takes us from Bonanno's childhood in Sicily up through his career as a mafia ""godfather"" in New York. It's a very detailed documentary about Bonanno's over thirty years as a ""godfather"" and there's an interview included with Bonanno's son, Bill, who at one point acted as his fathers ""consigliere"" in the ""Family"".
If you're a mafia buff then this documentary is a must!",1204588800,,744,4.912698412698413
