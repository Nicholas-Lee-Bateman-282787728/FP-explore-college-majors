5713249,5,B00CBTOPEA,"I enjoyed the story of the development of the horse Jappeloup and how Pierre had to grow to trust in him as well as trust his own riding skills. The jumping rounds that were shown from the Olympics and other events were quite exciting, It was interesting how they were able to show the footage along with the actors that played the parts of Pierre , Jappeloup's groom, and his teammates. The addition of Pierre's family story made it a very human and believable.",1436400000,3,462,4.511904761904762
