5114941,5,B007Z2DIEQ,"Each disk played perfectly.  Picture and sound were quite good. The movies are all excellent family fare.  The movies did not transition one story line to the next seamlessly, but that was easy to overlook.",1360195200,,206,4.857142857142857

5114943,5,B007Z2DIEQ,"Sorry, but it's a good savings, other wise I wouldn't have posted this. I almost bought this one until my husband found the set at Walmart for 17.99. Same one, for less! LOVE THE MOVIES!!! But I also love saving money. I buy almost everything on Amazon, so maybe someone should look into lowering this price, if possible?!
I gave it a good rating, because the movies are perfect for a family movie night! ;-)",1336694400,2,408,4.453333333333333
5114944,4,B007Z2DIEQ,"This was a great movie that told a wonderful story that the entire family will enjoy! While the tenor of the story speaks to tragedy and struggles, the movie brings out the special relationship between Flicka and the character of Kelly, and it is through this relationship that Kelly is able to come back from the despair and depression that she has fallen into. The story was a strong one and they did a great job at developing the characters within the movie. If you are looking for a movie that is heartfelt and one that shows the strength that lies within, this is definitely the movie to watch!",1335916800,,599,4.504587155963303

8523269,3,B007Z2DIEQ,"My daughter loves horses and fell in love with these movies. As a matter of fact, she listed owning them in her ""bucket list"". I decided to get them for her for Easter. When the package came, the last part of the case which held the last disc was broken so it was not held in place. Also, the 2nd disc Flicka 2 had a part which froze. I am not disappointed only due to the amount we paid for it.",1368230400,,395,3.888888888888889
