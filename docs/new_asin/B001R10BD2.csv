3772480,4,B001R10BD2,"In music, ""canon"" is a piece where a melody is repeated continuously, until additional followers in that piece begin to build on one another, resulting in beautiful harmony. I don't think the creators of this show - or the original visual novel, for that matter - could have possibly chosen a more appropriate title. Though a bit weak in a few places, and lacking some of the emotional ""oomph"" of Air TV, Kanon is still a worthy addition to Kyoto Animation's veritable series based off love sim games.

For those wondering, this review is based off the English language version of the series.

""Kanon"" begins with a very beautiful, snowy town, a very cynical young high school boy with amnesia, and a bevy of young girls either devoted to helping regain his memories, or cause trouble for him along the way. Though you could generally brand this show as pure ""moe"" harem, to do so would be a sad misunderstanding of what the show is trying to build to.

If the show does have one major flaw, it's how easily Yuichi Aizawa - the leading man - flits from one girl's problem to the next. Once one girl's arc is through and thoroughly handled, it's on to the next! Though it's a way for the producers and writers to cover every girl from the game, at the same time it feels rather redundant and not as emotionally exuberant as how the lead from Air seemingly managed to do it. Ah well.

The viewer is forced to sit through some girls with a bit of the same problems we've seen before, ranging from ""I'm going to die"" to ""I'm emotionally stunted."" It can be eye-roll inducing, but the show's saving grace is just how hilariously dead pan Yuichi can be, let alone the clever bits of sarcasm thrown in there. Without that, I don't know if I could've survived the sheer saccharine cuteness of some of the show.

But what is truly the one special thing that makes this show really something to check out? The atmosphere. Kyoto Animation have outdone themselves by creating an absolutely beautiful, ethereal town of falling snow amidst bright colors and saturated hues. It truly does feel like another world, especially some of the scenes at night where the lighting against the barren, white landscape can be truly breathtaking. This is certainly a studio that knows how to make a series that can dazzle with the animation and artistry alone.

The few flaws that grace the show pale compared to how well the dub and scripting is handled, as well as the beautiful animation and slow, methodical pacing. Of the Key/Visual series adapted to anime form, it could very well be the most beautifully drawn, and perhaps even the best story of the three told. Very recommended and worth checking out.",1246665600,2,2682,4.635789473684211
3772481,5,B001R10BD2,"Took a chance buying this series and was worth every penny. I feel it's worth watching and even if it's not your preferred genre there will still be at least one scene you'll never forget. Also, please bring a tissue cause even my eyes got moist....it's very emotionally driven.",1244764800,,278,4.6938775510204085
3772482,5,B001R10BD2,"First off Kanon is a really well done and creative anime.  It's done by Kyoto animations who worked on The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad and other great shows, and you can tell it's by Kyoto because of how beautiful the show looks, how well paced it is, and the way it's told.  It has an amazing cast of characters and is an entertaining (and sometimes depressing) show that all anime fans should see.

It comes in a very small package because it uses the slim cases (like in the Futurama season dvds) which I am not a fan of, but that's just my personal taste.  The artwork on the box and cases is very nice.  All of the 24 episodes are on 4 DVDs but I'm pretty happy with the quality, I was a little surprised with how good it looked.  It has both english and japanese voice acting (the japanese is amazing, and from what I saw the english seemed fine).  My only real gripe is there are absolutely no extras.  But if you enjoy shows like clannad, air  (or other anime drama series') you need to see this show.",1244764800,,1020,4.270833333333333

3772484,5,B001R10BD2,"This anime series is almost as sad as ""Grave of the Fireflies"". It's a very odd series with a very complex story line that, like a musical canon (Kanon) repeats the same theme but adding more detail and texture to create a beautiful and touching story. This is especially odd, because Kanon started out life as a ""ero"" (adult) game in Japan. It then saw life as cleaned-up G rated games on the Saturn and the Playstation game systems and was popular enough that it was made into a 13 episode anime series, followed by an OVA. The art on this original series was barely better than the game graphics, and, fortunately, Kanon was later remade into a 24 episode anime series with nearly state of the art graphics and very nice sound track. Pachabel's Canon in D even is used as background music in a few scenes.

Kanon is a series about relationships, and nearly everybody the hero, Yoichi, meets has a tragic backstory. These sad stories are all interwoven around a mysterious tragedy that occurred when Yoichi was a boy that was so traumatic that he chose to lose his memory of past events. At times the series hovers on the border of becoming a Harem series as the hero meets and befriends one girl after another. There is his pretty, air-headed cousin, Miyuki, who faces a crisis near the end of the story after a tragic traffic accident. There is the foxy Madoka, who has lost her memory and can only remember that she has a grudge against Yoichi. There is the weird Ayu, a tomboyish girl who lost her mother as a child and is fond of swiping food from street vendors. There is Mai, the demon huntress, who has strong supernatural powers. There is Saiyuri, the first year student with a terminal disease. As Yoichi helps each girl come to grips with the tragedy in their own lives, he eventually begins to remember the tragedy in his own past. Overlaying it all are the dreams and memories of one of the girls who cannot wake up from the dreams that have consumed her soul. The identity of the dreamer is kept secret for the first half of the series. Several of the stories choked me up, but poor Madoka's story brought me to tears. There seems to be an odd undercurrent of supernatural events behind the intertwining stories.

The story is complex and holds up to repeated viewing, in fact, repeated viewing is necessary to catch all the subtle hints. On first viewing I didn't understand if the ending was a delusion on the part of the Dreamer, a delusion on the part of Yoichi, or if the whole story was a delusion on Yoichi's part with only the ending being real. I had to watch it a second time before the Dream sequences made sense and explained the story line. The anime is deliciously crafted. Hints to later events are hidden in the earlier episode, hints that may not make sense until the story is viewed a second time: hints like the strange look Saiyuri's doctor gives to Ayu when they meet up in the hospital, or the silhouette of a tree that features prominently in the opening credits. There are also some strange goings on that are so subtle that they can be missed. When the hero encounters the Dreamer in the last episode, she is holding a doll that had vanished in the haunted forest when Yoichi returned it to what appeared to be a ghost of the Dreamer, who Yoichi believed to be dead.

Although the anime is based on an old adult game, the anime series is completely innocent. There is no nudity and only a few sweet kisses. And, at risk of giving too much away, considering how much tragedy the anime series contains, the story actually comes to a happy ending.

The art is beautiful, the story wonderful, leaving me disappointed in only one regard: only Madoka's story - which I thought was the saddest of all the stories - doesn't have a happy ending. This anime series is a great one to use to introduce a loved one to anime. It's also a good anime series if you are sick and tired of spaceships that transform into giant robots or martial arts series that take 52 episodes to resolve a two minute fight. It is a superior series that actually make you think. And cry.",1242864000,6,4094,4.469251336898396
3772485,4,B001R10BD2,"One guy and a bevy of beautiful girls equals a harem comedy right? Wrong, Kanon is a action-drama series that deals with some serious issues yet is very entertaining.",1242000000,,166,4.758620689655173
3772486,4,B001R10BD2,"It's almost impossible to find any reviews of Kanon that refrain from comparing it to the show Air.  Now that Funimation has acquired the rights to bring both of these (already similar) shows out just one week apart will likely do little to differentiate one from the other.  Having just watched the two series literally back to back, I can attest to the fact that Kanon succeeds in many areas where Air comes short.  Yes there are some similarities between the two that will warrant direct comparison throughout my review but in actuality, Kanon is certainly more emotionally taxing in its prose and scope.  Well before I get ahead of myself here, let's start at the beginning, shall we?

Released across 4 discs, Funimation is packaging up TBS Animation's Kanon in a complete series box set.  The packaging is quite appropriate if slightly mysterious in its rear panel summary.  Inside is a pair of beautifully artistic thin packs, each of which contains two discs.  The choice of whites and pale blues is subtly appropriate for the oft-snowy setting of the story itself.  I may even go on record as saying that the thin pack exterior art is the finest Funimation has released to date.  In all the show runs 576 minutes and earns a fairly conservative TV PG rating (no nudity, language, or violence to speak of).

The set, as has been the trend of late, contains virtually no extras to speak of although the language options are thorough (English dub and original Japanese with or without English subtitles).

With stories like this that play out literally as emotionally driven mysteries, I feel it's critical that I don't provide any spoilers while attempting to summarize the plot here.  That said, the story follows a high-school age young man who comes to stay with his aunt and female cousin after a seven-year hiatus.  The viewer is treated to the same laid back pacing that Air relished and Kanon even operates off the sometimes-monotonous rhythm of daily routine.  Where Kanon succeeds over Air is through the use of witty dialog that actually manages to be funny.  The lead character (Yuichi) has many genuine moments of interaction, especially early on when the massive cast is being established.

Interestingly enough, save for one other male, the cast is entirely female.  It sounds suspicious but manages to work surprisingly well.  Much of the story plays off the fact that Yuichi basically comes back to town with amnesia of his previous visit (which was just over summer vacation seven years prior).  The viewer is along for the unveiling of the facts right along side the lead character through frequent flashbacks that shed a bit of light present situations.

I won't sugarcoat the reality that this isn't a show for the overly sensitive as heartbreaks and a near endless succession of tragedies abounds.  However, if I can offer any insight without taking away from the show's charm it would be to hold off on passing judgment until you've followed it all the way through to completion.  Many of the show's mysteries and seeming impossibilities don't start making sense until the final couple episodes.  In fact, the bigger picture isn't fully realized until the last section of the final episode!

Like such classic films as the Sixth Sense, Kanon is setup with clues and hints all along the way that cannot be fully appreciated until the second or third time through.  Just prepare for a few of those ""how could I have not realized this the first time"" moments.

The show's art is simply flawless throughout.  Landscapes, textures, lighting, and ambiance are truly second to none.  Much of the show takes place over the course of a winter but don't for a minute suspect this left the artists with a pallet of drab grays and whites.  Truthfully, the sunsets, snowfalls, crunching sound of boots and steamy clouds of exhalation just dazzle consistently throughout.

Additionally there are many that attempt but few shows that succeed in so charmingly capturing mood.  Acting work, especially in the English dub, is outstanding.  This is especially admirable considering that such a large cast of similarly aged females surely required unique performances for distinction.  I should mention that a few characters do sound a lot alike but in the end the choice was most certainly deliberate.

With each of my reviews I like to attempt to nail down a single attribute that could be the show's greatest strength.  With Kanon I may have to bend my own rule on account of the fact that so many aspects come off so well.  I was initially leaning toward character development as, in this case, it is detrimental in moving the story along.  Here we have a cast of characters that is near impossible not to adore for their sincerity, innocence, sense of humor, and in many cases, realistic interaction with each other.  Coupled to the stunning visuals and solid voice work, it's tough to praise one aspect over the others.

In all, I won't kid you into thinking Kanon won't be difficult to market to the domestic general public.  Upon first impression of the cover art, I feared a tale leaning toward the female-set what with the five glassy-eyed girls and pink lettering and all.  However, and much like Air, this is a show with an abundance of heart and enough intriguing elements along the way to soften up even the hardest viewer.  It's a story that transcends fads, styles, cultures and even defies genres come to think of it.  We simply have nothing like this in the United States for a direct comparison and I'm certain that accounts for a lot of its charm.  It's definitely not for everyone on account of the fact that what it lacks in action sequences is made up for with the viewer's ability to connect with the cast.

Take even the name Kanon for example- it is cleverly explained in one scene to have been inspired by the musical definition (canon) whereby a composition consists of a single melody repeated over and over with the addition of more elements each time.  In a way I cannot think of a more appropriate metaphor for the show itself in its portrayal of life as being essentially the same day lived over and over with the addition of new experiences layered atop the familiarity of our routines.

Shows like this are successful not for their ability to focus on one aspect of the human condition but rather because they manage to grab hold of all of the little things that define humanity then put those elements together across a pace at which nearly anyone can relate.  Kanon is more of an experience, a chance to briefly live among someone else's creative vision than it is simply entertainment.  Kanon is truly timeless storytelling in the strictest sense of the word.",1240704000,60,6706,4.803836094158675

Anyone reading this, believe me; I collected the individual discs while spending over $200. I never expected this to become available. It is a bargain. You get the entire 24 episodes here.

3772503,4,B001R10BD2,"Back in the pre-2010s, the ""Key Visual Trilogy"" consisted of ""Air,"" ""Clannad,"" and ""Kanon."" What I mean by this is that these three anime (all adapted from Visual Novels of the same names) were known for being heart-wrenching tragedies where if you wanted a happy ending, you (or the protagonist) would have to quite literally walk through fire to obtain it. The ""Kanon"" anime was redone in 2006 to be a 24-episode anime rather than only 13 episodes. The visuals and audio were also remastered through the 2006 release. The real question: How good is the story?

The protagonist (Yuichi Aizawa) moved to a large suburb under the care of his aunt (Akiko Minase) and cousin (Nayuki Minase). The last time he was here was ten years ago, when something tragic happened which wiped out most of his childhood memories. As he meets new people around the town and the school, his memories begin to return, prompting not just one trauma but several.

Like the VN, each female heroine has their own story or past trauma which Yuichi is required to fix. As such, it is kind of like watching four or five different anime instead of only one (the same can be said of ""Air,"" ""Clannad,"" and other Key works). Whether or not you like the series will be dependent on how many of the arcs you enjoyed, or whether you enjoyed specific ones or not.

I thoroughly enjoyed the arcs for characters Mai Kawasumi, Shiori Misaka, and any side plots pertaining to the Minase family. However, I did not enjoy the arc for Makoto Sawatari, and hers is most vital to the main storyline's heroine (Ayu Tsukimiya). I do rewatch the series from time to time, but I tend to skip the Makoto arc entirely each time. Your mileage may vary.

All in all, it's a good series if you want something emotional and touching. I would say find somewhere that streams it legally first, and if it hits home for you, consider buying the collection.",1477094400,,1898,4.606508875739645

Loosely based off a visual novel, Kanon the anime does what adaptation need to always do, create a story that keeps the original material but creates a unique ending and an amazing show. Let's look at the story first. Our main character is a second year high school student (in Japan that's essentially the second to last year of high school). He ends up moving to his aunt/cousins house in a small town which he barely remembers being to several years ago. However as he will learn his past greatly affected several people and his re appearance will create ripples in his life and theirs. The story has a plot that once you start be prepared to get lost in a fascinating tale. The ending will make you smile and the various plot developments will make your heart dance, seriously this show is beautiful. The animation is pretty good, at times it shows it's age, this came out 11 years ago mind you, but nonetheless it looks stunning. The voice work dub wise is pretty good, a little weak at times but never does that hinder the story. The music is also stunning, which it should be seeing how the title is Kanon a musical concept. Overall Kanon is a wonderful anime. It hits all the right notes, music pun not intended, and is easily one of the best anime ever made.

There is an earlier version of this show with poor animation- skip that and watch this. Same goes for the Kanon movie- skip that, watch this. The animation and music are stellar, and they have a decent cast of characters with interesting backstories. I will say that if you have seen all of Clannad, then you have seen some of the arcs and plotlines before. Key tends to use some plot devices more often then others, and they often deal with some mix of miracles and mundane life. It's a really good show, and I am so glad that I bought this SAVE pack as it's a great price. Also, it has good packaging with each disc having it's own slot in the dvd pack. Personally, I hate spindle packs so this was a bonus. If you like slice of life with a little intrigue and a dash of miracle, then you'll probably like this show.",1425859200,3,1177,4.330316742081448

It's one of the few series that doesn't feel rushed towards the end which seems to be an epidemic among this genre. It's done really well and the English dub is very good, not Disney good, but close. I've watched it at least 4 times, and probably more than that. And with the S.A.V.E. discount, there's really no reason not to buy it. Renting is fruitless because you will want to watch it again.

My favorite part about this particular visual novel anime adaptation is the different personalities of all the female characters and the impact they have on the main male character. It is common in this genre of anime, that when one character's problem/arc is done they are sideline and don't serve any beneficial purpose to the overall story. However, this anime does not have this problem.

I'm not gonna get into the story but it mainly comprises of 4 arcs each more tragic than the last, but the final arc is the best while I personally think the first arc (Makoto) was the most tragic and made me tear up :( but so did the last arc. Ayu ugh such a cute character uguu! Lol

If you love tragic anime with heartwarming endings or just depressing and tragic anime than I highly recommend this and the Clannad series. Kanon and Clannad will always have a special place in my heart. I just hope America will release a Blu-ray Edition someday soon.

Like Air the animation is amazing. By far some of the best I have ever seen. While the story line was well written, thought out, and flowed well I did not like this the way I hoped I would.

Since Air was so sad I was expecting this anime to radiate the same feelings of sorrow but I at times I was taken by surprise with the turn of events that occurred.

If not for the animation being so stunning I would have given it a three. The story line just did not gab and hold me the way I hoped it would.",1388793600,,646,3.8421052631578947

3772659,4,B001R10BD2,"In a city called Amnesia. Wait, sorry, that's not it. In a city where the main character has terrible amnesia, everyone is prone to sickness and accident, and echoes of better things to come echo resoundingly (namely, Clannad), there's a guy named Yuuichi. He's moved in with his aunt, as he did seven years previously. His memories of that winter break are really hazy, borderline Elfen Lied syndrome. But he met a lot of people and affected a lot of lives in that break, and his return is the culmination of what he started seven years before. This is set off by the perky and cute Ayu, a girl he knows, but doesn't know. This continues with a chance meeting with a mischievous girl named Makoto and continues from there.

Kanon has the same set up as Clannad in that Yuuichi meets a host of girls who have some problems that he attempts to quell. The romantic interest is hard to guess because he seems so close to so many girls, but in the end there is one constant girl who he winds up with. A lot of the same elements as Clannad come up as well, especially prevalent being the supernatural aspect and the coma. Of course, this is the precursor to Clannad and should be treated as such now that we can look back at it. While it has a lot of failings, it is the start.

Kanon's story isn't great, but it's not bad. The problem with the story is how forced the depressing parts seem. I don't  know how many times the series tries to make me feel bad for characters by having their parents or themselves come down with unnameable diseases. The first time it was boring and cheap, the fourth time it was stupid. The series doesn't leave many characters without scarring and while I can commend it for having balls, I can't commend it for continually forcing me to watch scene after scene of shocked and sad characters after finding out their friends or family have been hurt or come down with disease. There are certain points where you will have a shocked expression sitting on your face because a  bad thing comes out of left field. though, and these are the most effective.

Makoto, Mai, and Shiori's sections of the story are all decently done, but none of it really stands out. The gradual progression of the disappearance of Makoto is nicely done and may be the only subtle part of the series. You know what's going to happen, and you feel for Makoto. Mai is different in the fact that none of what she does is really dramatic, I felt like I was watching a supernatural high school action anime instead of a drama. The part about her mother was groan-worthy, especially because it was the second sickness in the series. The drama came more so at the end of this storyline, and was fairly stupid in my opinion. Shiori's section, for me, was pretty archetypical and boring. It made nice progress character development-wise, but was otherwise nothing exciting and brought up the fourth instance of sickness (the third being Aunt Akiko). And then more happens to Aunt Akiko and this was one of the few moments I was left with my jaw dropped. As I said, it came out of nowhere and it hurt pretty bad.

Where the story is good is with the final section, dedicated to Ayu. As I watched it, I felt like I was watching Tomoya and Fuko from Clannad getting together. I was seeing characters I already know. And I was so happy too. I knew what was coming, but it was still emotionally riveting and dramatic to watch this storyline unfold, and an especially happy moment at the end. I felt that the romance between Ayu and Yuuichi was a little rushed, and he didn't seem as into her as he did Shiori or the other girls, but nonetheless it was still heartfelt.

The series as a whole can be considered forced drama, but there are moments that are seriously heartfelt and well done. And a lot of the good drama comes from the excellent cast of characters.

The characters are really moe, but that's okay. The personalities are all different, and while some are archetypical, some are a little different. Each character develops and grows on you, even Yuuichi, which I find commendable. Usually the main male character is someone you could give a ***** less about, a piece of cardboard being thrown around and rejecting any advances while simultaneously being an ***** to everyone he meets. Yuuichi is the opposite. While he is a snarky and sarcastic guy, he is, at heart, good. He does everything he can to help these girls and the fact that he cries over one of them just goes to show how different he is from the rest. He just knows the right way to deal with everything, and while his seeming amnesia is a nuisance (though part of that is explained later on) he's overall the best character in the entire show.

Oh, and Jun is Sunohara.

Why bring all this stuff about Clannad up? Because if you liked Clannad, you'll love Kanon. If you loved Kanon, you'll love Clannad. There are a lot of similarities, especially in the style of how the show progresses, but both provide great drama and great characters.

In Kanon there's only that one problem of forced drama, though; the fact that bad things are prone to happen to everyone. And while the happy ending is nice, you spend the entire show feeling like you're being made to cry or feel bad. As stated, there are points where things work and painful scenes are painful and there are points where it's boring.

Despite all the issues, it's still a thoroughly enjoyable anime. I laughed, I cried, I met new friends and found myself meeting old ones in different bodies. Never is it bad, it just never hits the stride that Clannad eventually will.

If you're looking for drama and characters you'll grow to love, then give Kanon a shot.",1372636800,,5680,4.5136186770428015

3772678,5,B001R10BD2,"I've seen at least a few dozen anime, but this one remains my favorite. The characters are all engaging and likable (except perhaps a few minor ones like the Student Council President), the plot is well-organized and full of genuine surprises, and Kyoto Animation's animation is spectacular and beautiful. It goes a step beyond the typical harem anime in that there is no silly, contrived mechanism binding the girls to be a part of Yuichi's life - they are his friends and hang out with him because he cares about them. It navigates emotional transitions from comedic to dramatic, from adorable to sad, without ever being jarring.

It is primarily an anime about character interactions and feelings that takes place in the real world. There isn't a lot in the way of combat, and there are no fantastic settings. It feels very much like something that could really happen, aside from a touch of magic here and there.

Kanon has a winter theme - expect lots of cold weather and outerwear. The corresponding summer and spring works are Air and Clannad, which are similar in many ways. I recommend all three.",1354924800,2,1105,4.780104712041885

This anime is truly a work of fantasy that delivers a few moments of goofy humor (uu gu!) and plenty of emotional depth to keep you interested. The main character is well developed and the supporting cast catches you in their arms as they move through the story. There are some very sorrowful moments in this one so if tearjerkers aren't you thing, you may wanna skip this.

3772682,5,B001R10BD2,"Kanon was one of the earlier Japanese visual novels (basically a dating sim computer game) by the team that would develop Air and Clannad.  These visual novels were immensely popular and were made into manga, animated movies, and anime series.  The game was released in 1999 and this anime series was released in 2006 to 2007.  The 'Air' visual novel was released after Kanon, but the series 'Air' was developed first (2005).

If you have seen Clannad, then there really isn't much to describe.  It is like Clannad light in a way.  We have the harem style anime, though in a slice of life setting.  Yuichi is a transfer student to a snowy, unnamed town.  Like in Clannad, we have many central female characters, a male sidekick of sorts, and then several supporting cast members.  The story revolves around the central male character and his interactions with the main female cast.  There is some drama, some comedy, romance, and many misunderstandings.

The characters in this series seem a little less developed than those in Clannad.  But what really stands out is that the characters do seem remarkable similar to those in Clannad.  But understanding the genre, it makes sense.  You have the sporty girl, the outgoing leader type girl, the silly girl, the quiet and smart girl; you get it.  They have a 'stereotype' for every young male's ideal female type.  The other funny and notable character is the male companion who seems like he is the long lost twin of Youhei.  And while we're at it, doesn't Yuichi seem like a nearly exact copy of Tomoya?

But similarity of characters aside, the series is good.  Very good.  Despite having seen Clannad and Clannad After Story recently, I was still able to appreciate and enjoy this series.  The setting works well for the mood of the story and characters.  It's not quite as richly developed as Clannad, but it definitely stands out for quality of story telling.

If you haven't seen Clannad, then this might be a good series to start with.  It's much cheaper than Clannad currently.  $18 for 24 episodes is quite the deal.

My personal preference is to view this series in Japanese with English subtitles.  The English dub is good, but the comedy really comes through in the Japanese.  There is just something about the inflections which you can't really put across in English.  Especially Yuichi's character and his wry sense of humor.  The Japanese voice cast is well matched with the character personalities.

Buy it.  Enjoy it.  Then buy Clannad and Clannad After Story if you haven't already.",1352246400,,2548,4.810623556581986

While my friends downplayed it in it's ability to draw emotions as Clannad did, I definitely disagree. This anime was just as powerful on the heartstrings, you just had to get more attached, the details weren't handed to you like they were in Clannad. All the characters are lovable, the OP and ED are fantastic, and the story was excellent. I can't wait to re-watch this again during the wintertime, to make it even more fitting.

All of the characters are wonderful, the music is incredible and the backdrop is breathtakingly beautiful. I was an emotional wreck after watching Kanon, fear not though. Everything will be o.k. After I saw Kanon for the first time I rediscovered emotions that I thought I lost many years ago. I am so happy that I found this series. Of the nearly 200 animes that I own Kanon may be the best. Clannad is the only thing I can think of that may be as good. However, Clannad has a terribly sad ending. Kanon doesn't. Kanon May be the best anime ever!",1348876800,3,826,4.20125786163522

I found myself with eyes not just tearing up, but with those tears streaming down my face and actually crying without stopping.

3772712,5,B001R10BD2,"This is the remake to an older Kanon which was... well... less than spectacular.
This remake is very well done.  Fun quirky characters, good music, over-the-top drama, good Japanese cast, and OK english cast.
The writers of this story stick to a similar idea through all of their stories.  From the original Kanon, to AirTV, to this Kanon, to Clannad we see a progression, and while the original Kanon and AirTV may be a little esoteric and don't exactly make a whole lot of sense if you think about them too long, this version is largely cohesive on plot, and the redemption of each character adds to the overall story.

I am torn between Kanon and Clannad for my favorite anime of this genera.  This has much more of a sleepy winter's day-dream fantasy/drama feel, and while the story is fun and touching, it is a little too fantastic to really take to heart.  On the other hand Clannad (which is extremely similar) is a little more realistic (though still fantasy drama), especially in the 2nd season which hit a little too close to home on a few points.  Both are great, with a similar story, but very different delivery.

Synopsis:
As with the other shows mentioned we see a drama which follows from the perspective of a male lead who is rather level headed moving to a new area where he is surrounded by people who have various dramatic problems which he has the ability to help.  In this particular show he is moving back to an area, and for some reason he cannot remember much from his old life there.  As the story progresses and he helps these interesting people, he learns that the reason for his repressed memories has to do with a deep emotional pain of his own, and a re-finding of passion and love in his life.

It's a great watch, and with the SAVE version you get to watch it in great quality for a great price (just no extras).",1334880000,,1845,4.464285714285714
3772713,5,B001R10BD2,First off let me start by saying that this has to be one of the best shows ive seen. In my opinion this show has great character development in a way that you actually care for the characters. At 24 episodes for roughly $20 this is a bargain. All in all i highly recommend watching this show.,1332460800,3,292,4.140350877192983
3772714,5,B001R10BD2,"Simple, light, exciting and really gives a lot of insight. I really enjoyed it! So worth the price!

Again, its just my own opinion but this one really hits my top 10 list. Simply amazing!",1331078400,,369,4.333333333333333

I was hesitant at first, just because the way the eyes looked on the girls. But when your watching it, all that goes away after a while.. and then they look more cute then creepy. (thats me anyways). The story is a bit slow going, but does make its point as it goes along. As in...the story gets clearer and clearer. It does have a few funny moments or parts. But you have too pay attention in order to catch them.(like mokoto when she gets her leg caught in between the door..or when yuichi drops..what looks like a bar soap or something ...down mokoto's shirt.( SO TRY NOT TO TXT SO MUCH TEENS ;) OR YOU'll Miss IT) And yes it does have it's sad moments as well. So like iv seen in another review....if you do get emotional...have those tissues handy. And as far as the ending....i did like how it ended. The only thing i didn't like...was really..what had happend to one of the characters. She didn't die or nothing, but i would have liked a better outcome of what happend too her. But yea... Five stars no doubt. I recommend this too anyone who likes A tiny bit of romance and comedy, but with a good slow and long mystery type of story...that ends good. :)",1316822400,2,1269,4.313807531380753
3772728,5,B001R10BD2,"It's extremely difficult to review this without nearly copy-pasting sections of my review of Air (especially since I saw them so close together), but I'll do my best.

Key/Visual Arts is here with another masterpiece.  Great characters, great animation, magical story, top-notch musical score, heavy emotional involvement.

This time, in Kanon, they've really outdone themselves as far as dialogue goes.  Pay close attention, or you might miss something important:  There's almost always more than one level of meaning.  Metaphors, aesops, and foreshadowing abound in simple lines you'd never suspect of such.  Even when there isn't anything more to be read into the dialogue, you can still expect it to be magical.  The English VAs are phenomenal--as you may expect--especially Chris Patton (Yuichi) and Brittney Karbowski (Ayu).  Everyone else is great as well; these two just stand out.

The characters are unique, sympathetic, relatable, and each beautiful in their own way.  Great effort was obviously put in to give them such depth.  Many have their own little quirks that make their personality easy to like.  You get attached to the characters easily and care about what happens to them.

The story is a little slow right at the beginning, but once you get sucked in, you get HOOKED.  The supernatural elements are very interesting.  And the way it all comes together...  It's really clean, innocent, nonviolent (mostly; what little there is isn't a big deal and only helps tell the story)--good for the whole family.

The visuals aren't as clear and crisp as other Kyoto Animation works (Air, Clannad, Angel Beats!), but is still well above average.  The night scenes in the city are the best, IMO.  The water fountain is REALLY stunning; the falling snow is pure, reminiscent bliss.  The coloring is great and realistic, but somehow surreal at the same time.  It's hard to describe, really.  Maybe it's the lighting or something...

The music is really good as usual.  There are lots of slow, melodic tunes to fill the course of the series.  Someone else already pointed out the connection between canon (as a musical device), the theme of the series, and the name of the series itself.  I am particularly fond of ""Kaze no Todoritsuko Basho"" (the outro song).  However, I myself feel that the intro and outro songs should've been switched.  Up until the last episode, I felt the moods would've been more appropriate that way.  But maybe this wouldn't have been for the best, because of how the outro song is used at the final curtain call at the end of the series.

On that note, without giving anything away, I can definitively say that the end of this series is the most heartwarming in any series I've seen.  It made me happy in ways words can't begin to describe.  Very satisfying conclusion.  It made me appreciate ""Kaze no Todoritsuko Basho"" much more.

*** SPOILER WARNING:  This paragraph contains a little spoiler.  If you don't want to read a spoiler, skip to the next paragraph ***  The only thing about the ending that was disappointing to many was how Nayuki wasn't shown to be definitively happy at the end.  They felt the need for there to be a little bit more closure on her end.

Any person with half a brain would find it impossible to give this series a 1 star review.  When you read the lonely 1-star here on Amazon, it's obvious that she has no idea what she's talking about.  The writing is beautiful.  It's impossible NOT to care about the characters.  If you don't, the problem isn't the show: it's you.  Saying they're obnoxious couldn't be any farther from the truth.  When Yuichi is mean to these girls, it's usually just to tease, and they take it too seriously.  And besides, if he didn't do that, he'd be perfect.  And we all know perfect people don't exist.  And the dialogue is easily one of the strongest aspects of the series.

If she were as experienced in anime as she claims to be, she'd know that you should ALWAYS expect the unexpected.  It didn't take long for me to figure out that you can't jump into a series with expectations that, if left unfulfilled, leave you disappointed (like it being ""reality-rooted"").  That's simply illogical and unreasonable--you're only setting yourself up for failure.  In fact, whenever I'm considering series to watch, I avoid reading information about it as much as possible JUST so I don't have expectations to be let down.  (Also because I like being surprised.)  The supernatural elements are what really made Kanon the beautiful masterpiece it is.  There wouldn't be a story without them (or maybe there could be, but it would be boring as hell).

ANYWAY, the moral of the story is: buy Kanon.  Unbeatable price for 24 episodes of one of the most beautiful series to grace the world of anime.  I guarantee you'll want to watch it more than once.",1315180800,3,4835,4.811435523114355

If you've watched Clannad then you will recognize some familiar voices in the english dub version.

Overall summary, Great Animation, Good Memorable Characters, Excellent Price. I recommend giving it a try to any fans interested in this genre.",1311292800,,614,4.913461538461538
3772731,3,B001R10BD2,"It's an okay anime. Done in the same artistic and melodic style of Cl'annad. Though for some reason I always feel like these animes were written by M.Night. Shyamalan. They all seem to be done in his odd story telling style. I checked out Kanon after watching Cl'annad. Much to say I think this one would of been better to watch before Cl'annad because it would have seemed ""fresh"". For the most part the works I've seen put out by ""KEY"" always have the same style of story telling. Meet a mysterious person, get to know them, drama happens, and wash rinse and repeat. This series is really no different from that basic format they use. The art and the music score is nice (why do the women in their animes shows have such large eyes?).

Those are bonus points though that keep you interested and as always really helps establish the characters expressions and feelings. I don't think the anime would come across with the same impact if it weren't animated so well. Though a visual novel leaves your mind to paint the picture animation is a bit different. Poor animation makes people not take the story so seriously but they did a great job here.

My biggest problem really was the story. The one thing I think KEY could really work on (and maybe something is lost in translation form the visual novels)is the relationship development. Essentially these animes are about building bonds and relationships. In Clannad the main character falls for a girl and ends up making a commitment to her but you never see them even kiss once. You honestly never get to see a ""romantic"" relationship grow between them. Their conversations and interactions are the same as with the other female characters. So when the main character decides to chose one girl out the bunch to claim as his love interests you're asking yourself ""How?"" and notably she's usually the least attractive looking one(in my opinion).

In Kanon they spend more time explaining the female characters and their stories. This was much better as they didn't do this really in Cl'annad. Outside of 1 story arc that I remember. In Kanon they explain all of the girls and their relationship to the main character (well his cousin gets kind of skimped over). The biggest problem with this series is that the main character seems to be more romantically capable with the other girls like Shiori and Mai because of how close he comes to them in their story arcs but when he chooses his love interests it doesn't make any since since it appears as though he had better chemistry with them than his overall choice. It really feels random and it's hard to connect even though it's explained the romance part is just never there so it feels forced.

I guess the only way I can explain it is like having the main character fall for a side character instead of another main character that has more screen time. His choice seemed more like a better ""friend"" than a romantic interest. That's the biggest flaw I see in the work of these types of animes. It leaves a lot of folks scratching their heads at certain points.

Overall with the lack of ""romantic relationship development"" the story was still interesting. 3/5 because the story just didn't move me like they wanted it to. Too much predictable drama and the usual format. In the end I'm confused still as of to who he chose to be with? His cousin or the his long lost friend? Like I said the relationship development in this one is really off.

P.S. if it was me I would have chosen Akiko. Who could pass up on a woman that wears house shoes half the size of her body.",1308787200,4,3568,4.575899843505478
3772732,4,B001R10BD2,"As a guy, this isn't the kind of stuff I usually watch...this one definitely falls in the chick-flick category.  That said, I somehow had it on my Netflix list, and...wow!  I'm glad I did.  I'll try not to spoil anything here at first at least.  As I said, this is a chick-flick that focuses on the relationships that the main male character, Yuichi, has.  Most of these are of the friendship variety - the only romantic endeavor is innocent and simple like it should be for kids of this age.  Most of the anime I've seen recently either have tons of bad language, questionable themes, lots of nudity, or all of the above.  You don't really have to worry about that with this one.  There's only a hint of nudity (male model posing for an art class seen from a distance), although it gets close several times.  Language - you'll hear much worse within half an hour any given night on tv.  What you get is a well thought out, imaginative, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny story that has some unexpected twists.  I loved the fact that, even though the themes in this story are simple enough for a younger audience to follow, the story is intelligent enough so that adults will be caught up in it.  The only things that keeps this from a 5 star show IMHO is... well at the end, show us - don't tell us that it did happen.  And then there's the thing with Nayuki and Yuichi - it doesn't really come out and say it, but it's implied there towards the end- maybe I'm reading too much into what was said because I've seen it rear it's ugly head in other anime -but, um, he's your cousin...find someone else.
The SAVE edition has no extras beyond some trailers which allowed them to get it on only 4 discs instead of the 6 discs the other edition I've seen has.

*small spoiler*
This show is a lot like 'The 6th Sense' in that they will show you seemingly unimportant things, then when you finally figure out what's really going on you think 'man I should have seen that coming.'  It's even more obvious the 2nd time through...they practically tell you what's coming and you just don't get it until...",1307491200,,2090,4.420365535248042
3772733,1,B001R10BD2,"My husband and I are big anime fans (my husband has seen dozens of series in their entirety), but this anime was honestly kind of painful to watch. The dialogue is very poorly written/translated, the characters are annoying and constantly argue over stupid things, and the fact that this is a supernatural anime was not at all made clear by any reviews or summaries, so it felt utterly out of place to us with an introduction of pure (annoying) character development. (Not to mention Yuichi is kind of an ass to all of these girls who like him.) Both of us absolutely would not recommend this anime. Bad writing, characters that we didn't care about, and a plot that takes way too long to develop and goes in a completely opposite (and absurd) direction from what the introductory episodes suggest.",1305072000,7,798,4.707142857142857
3772734,5,B001R10BD2,"I normally do not go in for this type of series. However ""Rumbling Hearts"" and ""Kanon"" are the exceptions.

 As far as animation goes it is above average as a whole. Watching the snow fall is just outstanding...coloring is great. Voices are very well done and for the price you can not beat it.

 Sometimes we experience things that are to tramatic for us and the mind blocks them out rather than deal with them. Hence the premises of the show. As a boy he spent time there but now returning as a high school student he sees familiar places but can not place them or some of the people.

 Story progresses nicely and as it does things begin to unfold. Yet there is a light hearted feel to it and for me it was the blend of comedy - tragedy and scenic settings that made this really stand out. It has a slight supernatural hint to it so it is not truly real life but the pain that one has to deal with is.

 As far as the box itself goes there is just a sticker on it that says ""SAVE"" so it looks fine when you remove it. Sound quality is good and moves around but could have been better.

3772754,5,B001R10BD2,"I highly recommend this series for anyone who might be interested in anime.  Its production values are high and the English dub is outstanding and I usually hate what English does to the meaning of the underlying Japanese.  The characters are well defined and mostly quite believable.

As several people have already said, the underlying plot is about a high-school boy, Yuichi, returning to a town he used to frequently visit, but now 7 years has passed since his last visit and his memories are vague.  As the series progresses, events occur that jog his memory and gradually things become clear.  The anime is broken into a series of story arcs, each focused on a girl he meets after returning, but with whom he had also a prior history. Yuichi's interactions with the girls, now and in flashbacks moves the story along.  This is a very hard series to describe without spoilers, so I am not going to say much more.  Except that Makoto is my favorite character :-).

I am now a full blown anime otaku (untranslatable, but means something like fanatic), however Kanon was one of the first series I saw and had a lot to do with my further exploration of the anime world.  I probably have watched 50-60 anime series and Kanon has always been rated in my top five, usually in the top two.  A great introduction to the power of animation not aimed at youngsters, but often is attractive to them as well.  I would not show this series to someone under 10 (unless they were exceptionally mature), not because of the content, but because of the complexity of the plot.

I personally would not call this Shojo Anime, i.e. targeted at young girls.  Kyoto Animation is well known for making series that appeal to a broad spectrum of tastes and this series is no exception.  While not an action series, there is action.  By no means is it a tragedy, but there were scenes so sad that they made this fairly cynical old man cry like a baby.  Not a fantasy, but supernatural events happen.  I frequently caught myself at least grinning at some of the antics and laughing out loud at others, but I definitely would not call it a comedy.  It's a genre specific to Japan; the closest US equivalent would be something like Happy Days (not very, but the closest).

For those who have seen this series and might be looking for something similar, I strongly recommend Clannad and Clannad - After Story.  One blogger said that Clannad series was Kanon done right.  I disagree that Kanon was done wrong, but the Clannad Series was certainly done right and Clannad - After Story is arguably the best anime series ever made.",1292716800,4,2600,4.596529284164859
3772755,5,B001R10BD2,"I got this DVD set three days ago, and I finished watching all of it just now. It was my third time watching the series, but I had never watched the dubbed version before now. I'll have to admit: the dubbed rendition evoked more emotions out of me than the subbed one ever did. All of the English voice actors did a fantastic job in my opinion, something that I've found to be uncommon when it comes to anime. However, if you really just don't like hearing it in English for whatever reason, this set provides the original Japanese audio along with English subtitles.

The DVDs are all pretty much bare. There are 4 DVDs total, each DVD containing 6 episodes and a few trailers. No extra features here. They all come packed in a normal-sized DVD box, as you can see from the images, along with a nice reversible cover. Good video and audio quality, but then again, I'm not really picky about that kind of stuff too much.

This rich and supernatural story is full of characters who are all easy to relate to. If you haven't seen the series before, there are places to preview it online, so go check them out already! If you have and you enjoyed it, you should definitely add this to your collection. The complete Kanon series for this price? Totally worth it and more.",1291507200,2,1267,4.4334763948497855
3772756,5,B001R10BD2,"This is a fantastic series.  The original work was a eroge (Japanese-ification of the English ""erotic game"") by Key Visual Arts.  The erotic content was removed for the TV series, making for a clean PG/PG-13 rated piece.  As it was originally a ""harem"" game (where the main character gets to pick one of a few girls to woo, date, and ultimately hook up with), the series goes through several different ""arcs"" for the girls in the game.  Each arc in the TV series is satisfying, fulfilling, and complete.  The main arc of the show ultimately ties the others together in a satisfying, alternately heartbreaking and heartwarming fashion.

The music is fantastic, especially the opening (""Last Regrets"") and ending (""Kazeno tadoritsuku basho""/""Where the Wind Reaches"") themes.  The visuals are great, as is expected from Kyoto Animation.  The character design is great and their stories will have you laughing one episode and sobbing the next.  I have not heard the English dub, so I cannot give any recommendation either way for that.

Also make sure you do not get the series by Toei.  The one by Kyoto Animation (this product) is the one you want.

If you like this, another series I would HIGHLY recommend from Kyoto Animation and Key/VA is ""Clannad"" and ""Clannad ~ After Story"".  It has a similar feel as Kanon, but the emotions are amplified at least by a factor of 10 (both the highs and the lows).",1291161600,5,1401,4.7875
3772757,5,B001R10BD2,"Kanon is Kyoto Animation's second of three adaptations they have done of Key's visual novels. Kanon (2006) is preceded by Air TV (2005) and followed by Clannad (2007). These three series are not connected, but share some character design aesthetics and the formula of ""main male character interacts with various female characters."" That said, of the three, Clannad is the only one that can be classified as a harem show.

As this review's title suggests, Kanon is equal parts mystery and drama, with a good dose of comedy thrown in. There are also elements of the supernatural and romance genres present here, however, it's important to remember that Kanon is, primarily, a mystery drama. The reason it's important to remember that is this: I've seen many fans of the more popular anime Clannad (which substitutes the mystery for more of a focus on romance) come to Kanon expecting a similar experience, only to find Kanon lacking because the romantic relationships aren't as fully explored as those in Clannad. Since these people have seen Clannad first, and Kanon is made by the same company and shares many superficial similarities, they naturally try to watch Kanon as if they were watching a different version of Clannad. This doesn't work, because the real strength of Kanon doesn't lie in the romance area. Don't get me wrong; Kanon has romance, and does it well enough, but if you're watching it with the mindset of ""this is primarily a romance story"" you're going to be disappointed when you compare it to Clannad.

Kanon's strength lies in its mystery. Why can't Yuichi remember his last trip to this snowy town seven years ago? Are the legends of the hill overlooking the town being a magical place true, and if so, to what extent? Is the demon hunter actually fighting demons, or is she just insane? Who is the lonely, mysterious girl Yuichi sees outside his classroom window every day? And how does this all tie into his original problem of memory loss?

So, yeah. Clannad is a romance/drama with comedy and some mystery. Kanon is a mystery/drama with comedy and some romance. In many superficial ways they are quite similar, but if you try to watch them the same way you'll be doing one of these shows a disservice, and will probably end up preferring the first one you watched. I've seen both shows, and I prefer Kanon by far (Kanon is my favorite anime ever), but I recognize that Clannad does its own thing and that some people prefer its more romantic approach.

If you're not familiar with Clannad, forgive me for talking about it this much. You have to understand that many (most, actually) of the impressions I see from new Kanon watchers come from people fresh off Clannad, drawn to Kanon because the two shows are made by the same company. They almost always unfairly criticize Kanon for not being the romance it never tried to be. Part of the reason I'm writing this review is to prevent more people from going into Kanon with the false preconception that it's trying to achieve the same goals as Clannad. Like I said, you can't watch them with the same mindset. An example of that is this: since each of the main girls in Kanon represents a mystery, the girls don't become friends and associate with each other like they do in Clannad. The girls in Clannad all get to know each other because that plays into the function of the romance genre, creating a harem so that the male lead has to choose who will be his girlfriend. In Kanon, however, that same approach would downplay the mysterious nature of the girls. Instead, Yuichi interacts with them more or less alone. The girls do cross paths with each other from time to time, but they pretty much keep to their own separate cliques. Many Clannad fans claim this to be a flaw of Kanon's, when really it was a conscious choice the writers made to focus on the mystery genre. And Kanon pulls this off naturally. Just think about your own high school days - it isn't uncommon for a high school kid to have friends from various cliques, keeping those friends separate from each other. Since Yuichi is the new guy at school, this is even more appropriate, since such social drifters are often the kids who haven't established themselves firmly in one clique or another.

Kanon's visual theme is very pleasing. If you have a soft spot for snowy landscapes, you're going to love the look of Kanon's little winter town. The comedy is laugh-out-loud funny, relying on witty banter and an overload of cuteness. The comedy gives way to the drama in the second half of the series, and be warned: the drama can get pretty intense and depressing. If you don't want to be depressed, this show is not for you. Much of the drama stems from supernatural origins, and some of the supernatural explanations are derived from Japanese folklore. You won't have to know the folklore to understand, since the show explains things, but you may think the explanations are a little out there if you don't know anything about Japanese mythology.

I need to give a special mention to the English dubbing. It's superb. Often times with anime shows, I'll find the English voices grating and switch to Japanese voices with English subtitles. The English dubbing for Kanon is so good that I didn't even think about watching it in Japanese (though I'll probably do it in future viewings, to see how much the dialogue was changed). I love the voices for all the major characters.

Kanon is a series full of wonder, joy and heartache. I'm in my upper 20's, just old enough to have become jaded about my entertainment. Watching Kanon made me feel like a kid again. I can think of no higher praise for a show, anime or otherwise, and I know I'll be watching it again and again in the years to come. It's my favorite anime ever.",1288051200,3,5765,4.673891625615764

3772761,5,B001R10BD2,"Kanon is an excellent Shojo (audience -- young girls) anime.  My wife and 12-year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed this show.

I believe the company that made this anime also made Clannad.  I think if you liked Clannad, you'll like Kanon.  While the look and feel of the series is much like Clannad, the stories are completely different.

The main character is a 17-year old boy named Yuichi who has moved to a much colder part of Japan to live with is aunt and female cousin.  He is a high school junior.  There is no uncle, and we don't ever find out why Yuichi has moved here from his parents, but he has a history in this town.  Yuichi used to regularly visit his aunt and cousin during school breaks.  He stopped 7 years ago and has virtually no memory of any of his past visits.

Yuichi is fairly sharp witted, a very decent guy, and good at making fun of people in a light-hearted way.  We found his banter very entertaining.

The overall story is basically a series of intertwined odd stories concerning female characters whose lives are generally related to Yuichi's past in this town.  As the stories unfold, Yuichi remembers more of his past and the resolutions make more and more sense.  We don't find out why his memories are suppressed until the second-to-last episode.  The final episode is more-or-less a resolution episode.  We found it very satisfying.

There is some paranormal, but it's not creepy or scary stuff.  While there are many female characters and one main male character, this is not a ""harem anime"" and there is absolutely no ""fan service"" (gratuitous female body parts shown).

In my opinion, Kanon was not as emotionally intense as Clannad; however, there are many very touching scenes.  I was never bored and I could hardly wait for the next episode after finishing one.",1286323200,2,1804,4.6847133757961785
3772762,5,B001R10BD2,"Wow, I have never seen anything like this show . The emotions this series evokes roll in like ocean waves varying between highs and lows , its like an emotional roller coaster. Kanon is a masterpiece that everyone should experience ,not just anime fans.
Here's a good example of judging something by its cover. I had seen the reviews , but didn't think this would be 'my cup of tea' so to speak , so when I saw it at a really good price I picked it up. Now I could kick myself for not getting it sooner.
For me Kanon was so emotionally taxing that I was afraid to watch the last 3 episodes, but I've been loaning my anime to my daughter in law who has been getting into anime , and I'm glad I finished it, it's a very fulfilling journey.
One word of warning though. Keep plenty of tissue handy. I ran out of tissue and grabbed some paper towel and well lets just say Bounty works great for wiping up spills but not so much for wiping noses. My nose now looks like like I'm suffering from some strange nose disease.
So to sum it up, if you haven't seen Kanon you are missing one of the best series ever.",1282003200,3,1102,4.130232558139535
3772763,5,B001R10BD2,"I've been watching Anime now for a while. Basically I got started because my daughter wanted something else to watch after Teen Titans stopped making new episodes. I like the idea of having cartoons that aren't brainless or devoid of feeling. I have bought a lot that we watch together, but some of the Anime with more complex storylines I thought might be beyond her (She's 10), but she surprised me with getting a lot more about the stories than I would have thought. We watched Shuffle together and she will frequently sit down with me and ask to watch it again. So I started looking for some similar titles and I happened upon Kanon.

Parents:
There is absolutely no fan service in this Anime. (Fan Service means scantily clad scenes put into the show for no other reason than exciting pubescent boys) This is what's called a Shojo Anime, or an anime that is meant for young to teen aged girls, and it shows. Kanon relies more on imagery, storytelling, and dialog to move the story along. No one gets beat up. There is one scene with a hint of blood, but I assure you it's not unnecessary -- it comes as a vital part of the story. I didn't detect any cursing and the situations are not ludicrous. If you're looking for something more actiony, then this is not the title for you.

There's a reason it's called Kanon. It's fully explained within the series but it's a subtle explanation. It's a play on the musical term of a canon. Think row,row, row your boat --it's a repeating melody that gets more complex as you pass each repetition. This happens in the story as well. It's about Yuichi, who had come back to live with his Aunt Akikko and his Cousin Nayuki after 7 years. Yuichi discovers that he has no memory of his last visit 7 years ago. Through his interaction with the other characters in the story, Yuichi begins to remember what he repressed, and eventually why he repressed it. Most of the girls that he interact with knew him from before in one way or another. Along the way, Yuichi encounters Ayu, a short girl with a winged backpack. She's bubbly and kind, and despite his sarcastic view of things, Yuichi is smitten with her. She remembers him from before and soon Yuichi is set down a path of discovery that will lead him through a lot of personal heartache. As he rediscovers each set of memories, the richness and fullness of his life there becomes apparent.

Unlike a lot of other Anime, this one has an ending that does bring the story to a definite conclusion. It's not a harem comedy --though Yuichi has strong feelings for his friends, he's not conflicted in the slightest about them. So if you're looking for that, you're really going to be disappointed. I bought this one because I wanted to make sure that I had some new ones for my daughter, but I don't know if she'll take to this one. It's basically a slice of life style of anime and there are funny moments but it isn't a comedy. There were definitely a couple of times that I did tear up, and I found the ending to be especially satisfying. I think that there really isn't anything bad that I have to say about this anime. I think parents may find this enjoyable to sit down and watch with their kids.",1275523200,166,3188,4.446153846153846

3772767,5,B001R10BD2,"The same story writer as Air and Clannad, and visuals done by the animators who did Haruhi (the main character seems strikingly similar now that I think about it).  From what I understand of it Kanon was done first, but was a rushed production and everyone hated it, then they did Air which is of a similar genre, and then released this Kanon 2006, which was much better done, followed by Clanned (which I have not seen yet).
Having seen Air it is impossible to seperate the two, and Air should be seen first as it feels like a prototype of Kanon.
The title is based on Canon in D. The idea being that life has themes that largely repeat themselves over and over, but the song gains fullness and complexity as time goes on.  What started as a simple melody becomes an emotive theme full of the many gains and losses throughout the progression.
The basic story is the same as Air, of a young man going around and trying to fill the voids in people's lives around him.  But in this case it quickly becomes clear that something happened 7 years ago that caused the main character much pain, which then tore him from the lives of the people around himself. The voids he has to fill are the pains he caused his childhood friends.
As can be expected this is extremely melancholic (but at the same time has some great moments of comedy), and you will feel the need to find a ""I survived Kanon"" T-shirt after finishing this emotional roller coaster.  But with that said this show was captivating, and I couldn't put it down after the real story got going.  I love anime, but can only usually watch 2-3 episodes at a time (which is perhaps healthy).  This story got me going, and I watched episodes 10-24 all in one sitting.  Definitely worth owning, and also good for a re-watch (Several seemingly random still shots in the series have their meanings revealed in the end).

Only 2 complaints;  1) (and this may be an encoding problem) is that walking characters looked too much like cardboard cutouts on a background.  I realize that is what they are in almost every show, but in this it was a little jarring.  2) While the soundtrack was good, it did not seem to measure up to the rest of the story.  If they ever did a 3rd remake they need to hire Yoko Kanno and let her go to town on it!

Lastly, Koop has a great AMV based on this called Twilight ([...]), which is what got me interested in the show.  It contains a few spoilers, but I still found the show highly engaging because the climax is going to rip your heart out whether you see it coming or not!

Once again, great story, great characters, great animation, and a solid soundtrack all adds up to a great show!  Enjoy.",1266537600,,2673,4.380566801619433

5 stars?  Well that's a good sign.  I heard of this anime after watching and purchasing Sola, (A MUST BUY), after discovering that one of the creative minds behind the Sola anime was involved in this series.  Sola was voted anime of 2007, and many sites voted Kanon to be the anime of 2006.

With the drought of quality anime this day, I was desparate to find something good to follow up Sola, and the reviews here at Amazon.com were enough to convince me to take the plunge.

I have to admit, after reading the plot under various product description sources, it didn't sound as if there could be very much depth to the series, but everyone gushed over it, so I gave it a shot.

I must say that despite my early concerns and pessimism, this series truly lives up to the hype.  It does start off a bit slow, but as the series continues, things progress to a whole other level.  And another, and another...  Truly worth of the series title 'Kanon'.

The storytelling and pacing are truly amazing.  There are so many subtleties that I overlooked initially, that all stood out as events unfolded.

3772773,5,B001R10BD2,"I'm currently viewing this series for the second time. The first time I watched it, I rented it. Afterwards, I bought this edition of the series. If someone had tried to describe this series to me before I viewed it, I probably wouldn't have wanted to watch it. I have a great appreciation for Japanese animation and have watched a lot of it. I would certainly rank this with the very best. What initially piqued my curiosity was reading somewhere that this series was very popular in Japan. When I read that I decided I should check it out. I had no idea what it was about. After watching the episodes on the first disk, I still had no idea where the story could be going. In fact, the story seemed quite weak. But the character development, largely thanks to the superb Japanese voice-acting, was wonderful. The first third of the series is an introduction, an overture, in which we get to know something of the personalities of the various characters. In hindsight, it's also the time when the hook is being masterfully set. Following this, the first ""minor"" theme is developed and concluded, and then there's no going back. If you're intrigued by this vague description, I would recommend that you watch the series without any research beforehand, and with the Japanese language/English subtitle options chosen. Then, you'll experience for yourself the power of this amazing anime.",1253404800,,1385,4.823529411764706
3772774,4,B001R10BD2,"Worth it? Yeah, even after getting caught out by the ADV collapse. I had the individual discs 1 - 4 & 6 from Funimation  but missed #5. Having now watched the Complete Series, there is no way I could have watched what I had and gotten any sense of it or any real enjoyment. Coronation St this isn't in that a chunk of programs can be skipped and you pick up the story ok.

What you don't get in this collection are the 8 episodes of 'A Close Look at an Anime Production House' that cover the steps of making anime.

The story is set during a long northern winter, and this, along with appropriate music (inc Pachelbels' Canon) really suits the tone of the show.
The story is quite engrossing and has an element of mystery about it that stays just out of reach - a dangling carrot so to speak. The character designs have been criticized as being too similar, but not by me! This is anime & they look just fine. Each main character has a back story which gets explored and indeed, none of the characters seem superficial or superfluous. The standard of art is consistently high.

It may help to understand that the show is the second of three (so far) anime that have been based on video games produced by Key (1st being Air TV, then this, next Clannad) and this influences the structure of the story whereby the main male character deals with each main female in turn. I initially felt that once a girls story was done, she was neatly put away, but upon reflection there were references back to each as necessary.
There are some quite emotional moments and some that could make you look away.
I was left feeling that this is a very good show and I must watch it again to pick up on the details and fill in the gaps. Enjoy!",1253059200,,1721,4.302469135802469
3772775,5,B001R10BD2,"Kanon is probably one of the most touching, beautiful animes I've ever seen. The plot is great, the art is amazing, and it has characters you can care about (unlike many animes).

If you are a fan of Air, then Kanon is the anime for you. I wouldn't reccomend it to people who like comedy (although it does have a bit of humor in some episodes), but most anime fans are sure to like it.

I've watched this series 2 times, and I'm ready to watch it a 3rd. It's now my favorite anime (along with Air). =)

So, buy Kanon. You won't be dissapointed.

3772776,5,B001R10BD2,"Kanon the complete series is a romantic drama based of a visual novel by key.  Its very similar to Air(tv)if you've seen it.  The story here is rather simple.  The ultimate nice guy Yuichi Aizawa has returned to the town snowy in which he once lived but he can't remember what happened back then.  in this new town he runs into (or they run into him) several beautiful and troubled girls, so Yuichi as the nice guy he is has to worry about them and try to help them.

The first few episodes introduce you to all the girls.  The begin is probably the best part because of the great humor and its less sad.  Shortly after however you are Slammed with the saddest thing to ever happen in an anime ever. (unless you've seen another Key anime) the anime ""solves"" each of the main girls' problems one at a time as yuichi tries to recover his memory.
This has alot of  super natural quality's as though strong emotion is not bound by reality.  buy this show theres no way you'd regret it",1247616000,4,980,4.311475409836065

8337107,2,B001R10BD2,"As the first Key visual novel and the 2nd to be adapted by Kyoto, this series is expected to have some problems especially since it was meant to be a dating sim/visual novel, focusing on one girl, rather than all 5 unless you replay and make different decisions. With that said, while Kanon 2006 may have its issues...that still makes it far from being perfect...really.

First if all, the character designs. If you are a fan of cutsey, alien faced, huge-eyed, almost no mouthed, moe blobs then you've already found a perk that will draw you in. If not, then steer clear, especially if you are not a fan of drama, comedy, slice-of-life stories with a touch of fantasy.

These are the characters in Kanon:
Yuuichi Aizawa (protagonist)
Nayuki Minase (Decoy Main Girl)
Akiko Minase (Decoy Main Girl's Support Character...and mom)
Ayu Tsukimiya (Main Girl)
Makoto Sawatari (Third Girl)
Amano (Third Girl's Support Character)
Mai Kawasumi (Fourth Girl)
Sayuri Kurata (Fourth Girl's Support Character)
Shiori Misaka (Fifth Girl)
Kaori Misaka (Fifth Girl's Support Character)

As you can see, the roster adds up pretty much like a video game. You have your main fighters and supporting fighters. Most notably, the cast is all female...as expected from an Adult's Visual Novel focusing on the appeal of...well...females. I am not even going to mention Jun Kitagawa, the butt-monkey, classmate because his presence in the show is useless and not worth mentioning.

I mentioned all the character's because it is important I list them all in order to point out the one, overall, over-used problem this show has. That would be the terminal illness plotline for EACH CHARACTER. I am dead serious. Jun Maeda...or Key has a serious fascination for terminal illness because it is present in ALL of the original Key trinity titles: Kanon (1999), AIR (2000) and CLANNAD (2004). Let me list them as the series goes by...

Nayuki Minase...while her story does not have terminal illness happening to her, her mother Akiko gets into a car accident and the chances of her surviving are slim. That's prettt much the same as terminal illness...whether someone will make it out of a sickness/injury alive. I am counting these 2 together because Nayuki's story revolves around this.

Next. Makoto Sawatari. Oh look. A fox who made a wish to become human...but the price of that is her life. She will slowly get more sick until she dies. Terminal illness. Her support character Amano...had a similar fox friend who suffered the same thing! Terminal illness!

Next. Mai Kawasumi. Oh, a girl fighting demons. That's sonething original. Oh wait...her mother was suffering from terminal illness in the past but Mai's tears healed her! Oh look. Her support character Sayuri gets injured by a demon and is hospitalized! Will she survive?? Terminal illness! And look!! Mai stabs herself and is bleeding profusely. Will something save her? Terminal illness!

We're nearly there so bear with me! Just like Nayuki/Akiko sharing the same illness plotline...this stupid girl, Shiori Misaka...HER ENTIRE STORY REVOLVES AROUND HER SUFFERING FROM AN INCURABLE ILLNESS!! So Yuuichi, the nice (jerk) guy that he is decides to make her happy til the end. Sounds like a reused, tired soap opera. But her stupid older sister, Kaori wants to distance herself from her so that she won't be hurt when she dies. Ohhh so sad! Shiori is my least favorite girl in Kanon not because of her tired plotline, but also her boring design, her unhealthy obsession for ice cream in cold weather and for having the stupid catchphrase ""I hate people who do/say things like that."" And she said it WAY more times than it was needed. Seriously. I could not care less whether she lives or not. Bye b***h!

Lastly...Ayu Tsukimiya, our main heroine and Fuko Ibuki clone. You guessed it. She's a ghost! She's an astral projection and her body is in a coma. This happened 7 years ago at the start of Kanon's setting. Will she wake up or not? Terminal illness plot.

So there you have it. Besides Nayuki and Kaori, their stories DO INDEED revolve around a sick characters so they fit in this tired plot device category. And I'm not even going to get into Yuuichi's amnesia problem. That's also...pfff...pretty tiresome. You see, 7 years ago when he visited the town he interacted with 4 of these girls but left. The trauma he experienced caused him to forget everything. Oh wait. There's another reason I don't carw for Shiori. Its because she isn't one of the girl's he met in the past. You might as well call this show ""Terminal Illness: Miracle in the Snow"" or something else similar or lame.

The only great things going for this show are the music and background art. It is absolutely stunning. But what else did you expect from Kyoto? That's my opinion. Steer clear of this one and stick to Clannad After Story or Angel Beats instead. Angel Beats may have been too short and rushed...but it makes you feel for our leads, even without learning about the side characters. Short series' are the better ones anyways. Be well.
