2765046,3,B000NDFHW0,"This video deserves about a C+ ...The title says 'Dance' but the video has very few actual dance moves. It was more of a low/medium impact step class without the step. very very basic. The music was a bit annoying & boring as well, but you can tune that out...This video is certainly not the best dance video I've done, but it was still a good cardio workout, and it is better than not doing one at all!",1183420800,7,403,4.17948717948718
2765047,4,B000NDFHW0,"Self Magazine has been putting out exercise dvds for a little while now and each that I've seen, are really good.  This is another good workout that gets your heart-rate up and burns heaps of calories.

Kimberly Spreen is the instructor (home exercisers will know her work - she's excellent) and is motivating and energetic.  It's dancey and easy to follow along and not too hard to get the moves down.  There are latin style moves like mambos and cha chas and regular cardio moves like jumps, kicks and jogs.  She always stresses that it's more important to have fun rather than try to be absolutely perfect and try too hard.  It's nice to have it filmed outdoors because seeing the sunshine is motivating when Summer is around the corner, or you are in the midst of a gloomy Winter.

This is a fun workout that is probably best for beginners or more intermediate people rather than if you are advanced - you'd be bored.  I like this one and really recommend it if you want a fun workout that you can do in around 50 minutes.",1177459200,28,1026,4.449197860962567
8176946,4,B000NDFHW0,decent dvd-all of the self dvds usually work if you use them!  its a fun way to change up your routine!,1341187200,,103,3.9047619047619047
8176947,5,B000NDFHW0,havent had this much fun in a long time.  takes less time than driving to and from the gym.  no more gyms for me!!!,1328140800,,115,3.75
8176948,4,B000NDFHW0,The instructor has a great personality and keeps you motivated. This dvd is good for beginners to intermediate level. I enjoyed the dance moves and the music is pretty good.,1281830400,,173,4.8
8176949,1,B000NDFHW0,"I thought that this would be a good way to get into shape, but I couldn't be more wrong. It is very slow paced, and when you are trying to follow along, they switch moves before telling you what they're doing, so you can't really follow. I would not recommend this tape to anyone.",1259020800,,280,4.203703703703703
8176950,4,B000NDFHW0,"This video was not quite what I expected it to be.  It's not really a ""dance"" video.  It more of an aerobic workout done a little bit jazzier.  However, it was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed doing it for the full 50 minutes, and that's not something I can say for many videos.

I'm not in great shape and am really uncoordinated, so the first time I tried to do it, I had a bit of a problem following along, but the cuing is pretty good, so after that time it was easier.  There are times when my heart was really pumping, but they didn't really last too long, which was a shame.",1235433600,,580,4.0
8176951,2,B000NDFHW0,"I like Kimberly Spreen and have worked out with her before.  I also enjoy other videos in the Self magazine series.  However, if you're looking for a workout that will get your heart pumpinig and your muscles really working, this one isn't for you.  I felt like the routine spent way too much time with simple hip-rotations and slow step-touches to be an effective workout.  I felt like my time was being wasted more than once during this 49-minute video. On a positive note, this might be a good workout for someone who's looking to get some light activity in their day instead of sitting on the couch.  Kimberly has a great attitude, and the outside setting is pretty.  It's just hard to recommend this to intermediate/advanced exercisers.",1221436800,4,741,4.75
8176952,4,B000NDFHW0,"This is a fun workout with a vetran home fitness leader.  I enjoyed the flow and that there wasn't a ton of taking it from the top and thought tha Kimberly was encouraging and cued well.  HOWEVER, it's not a dance workout at all, more of a lower impact cardio routine with a dance flair.  If you're looking for a dance workout, give this one a pass.  If you like low impact cardio, this may be something you'd enjoy.",1208476800,4,416,4.227848101265823
8176953,2,B000NDFHW0,"SELF's Dance You Way Slim is a 50-minute cardiovascular dance workout (a little less, of coarse, without the warm-up and cool-down).  POSITIVES: The instructor, Kimberly Spreen is fun and encouraging with a great personality (and even her mute back-up dancers have personality!).  If you keep moving, you will sweat a lot and get a decent workout. The outdoor setting (Arizona, I believe) is nice.  NEGATIVES: If you are a high intermediate to advanced exerciser, you will only want to pull this one out on your light days, or for a little variety, as this one is not too intense at all (it is the sheer length of the workout that will make you sweat as opposed to the actual workout itself). In fact, a lot of the moves are so easy that they seem to cause your heart rate to go back down (and I don't think they were intended to).  As there are a good bit of athletic moves such as jogging, jacks, etc., a lot of it is not really dance.  BOTTOM LINE: There are a lot of other, better dance-based exercise DVDs out there.",1204502400,9,1021,4.438502673796791
8176954,3,B000NDFHW0,"I love dance workouts & have a whole collection. I gave this a shot from my library & glad I didn't even waste it on a rental.
It's Kimberly Spreen w/2 women backup in someone's backyard w/an incredible mountain view background. The music is all synthesizer which was annoying & not motivating.
This is mostly a lot of step touches, some ""fancy"" jogging, some jumping jacks w/some easy dance moves thrown in like some mambos, cha-chas, double steps, single-double lung move, chest pops, single hip circles, and kinda arobic hip hop wanna be. All the moves weren't done well in my opinion considering I like dance videos from people who can dance well w/fluidity & body awareness & enthusiasm. Kimberly has none of this..
I felt like I was in a 1980s aerobics class. That's said, this is not a ""no pain, no gain"" pace, but more sedentary. If she gets your heart rate up with a few jumping jacks, she immediately has a rest, so you move fast, slow, fast, slow...
She does cue very well & she goes in 1/2 time several times before going to normal tempo, but she doesn't explain the moves except from an aerobic standpoint.. say for crescent hip circles ""keep that core engaged...""
It has a 5 min warmup & cool-down with 40 min ""workout""

8176955,3,B000NDFHW0,"I am not very coordinated, but for the most part, I was able to follow the tape.  It is not extremely aerobic, but I thought it gave me a pretty good work out.  I felt it the next day.  I currently use free weights and treadmill and got this for variety.",1191542400,2,254,3.9411764705882355
