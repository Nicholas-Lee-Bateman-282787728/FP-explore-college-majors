This beautiful, powerful film offers great insights into the creative mind as applied to science, and it is an important piece of work. I was particularly grateful that it included an interview with Gertrude Elion, a brilliant scientist whose accomplishments won her a Nobel before her death at age 81. I recommend this to anyone interested in innovation and ideas, and I also suggest Apted's documentary on artists and musicians called INSPIRATIONS. Wonderful work!",1078704000,11,643,5.0754716981132075
7933466,4,B000059HE4,"Since documentaries are featured as extras on many DVDs, there's a growing appetite for this cinematic art form. Criterion is feeding that craving with a series of fascinating glimpses into extraordinary real lives.

""ME & ISAAC NEWTON"" is a wonderful companion piece to Ron Howard's critically acclaimed ""A Beautiful Mind,"" answering the question of why science matters.  Award-winning director Michael Apted (""Coal Miner's Daughter""), explores the inner worlds of seven scientists in this captivating documentary that looks at the life and influence of a giant who saw the cosamic riddle as evidence of the hand of God who was at the controls of a mechanistic world.

By the way, Isaac Newton wrote more on the riddles of Biblical prophecy than he did on mathematics!  He was remarkable and so is this great little documentary that is way to short in length and on the facets of this incredib;le man who changed our world views.",1013731200,16,930,5.01948051948052
