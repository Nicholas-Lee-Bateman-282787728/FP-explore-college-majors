8064526,4,B0009OL8US,"One day they may clean up the picture but when you get into the story, the bad copy may just add that 1942 ambience.

A spinster known as Aunt Emma (Zazu Pitts) to her friends missed her chance to marry a prizefighter. However, after his death she takes a chance to help his son to become a great fighter.  She travels form a small Midwest town to the big city. There in her efforts to help him she crosses paths with several criminal types. They spot her umbrella and mistake her for the guntote'n Ma Parker criminal type.  Soon the bad guys are being dispatched like flies. Maybe she is Ma Parker. Let us watch and see who is next.",1275609600,5,633,4.258333333333334
8064527,3,B0009OL8US,"This is a Monogram Studio film from 1942, a strictly second feature lasting 62 minutes.  It's mildly amusing; on the level of a Bowery Boys film from the same studio.  Zasu Pitts, all of 44 years old, is the ""old lady,"" Aunt Emma, and she plays the part well.  This is a 2 1/2 on a scale of one to four: competent and watchable, but wholly forgettable.  Douglas Fowley is in the film, one of his hundreds of ""B"" level movies.",1138579200,2,425,4.209876543209877
