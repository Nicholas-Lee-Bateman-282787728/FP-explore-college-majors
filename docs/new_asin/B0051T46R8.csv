The horse was not even abandoned. Lady in movie ""The family just signed over the horse today for placement."" All in all, the movie is verrrry slow. I would not recommend it even if you love horses.",1334707200,7,359,4.698412698412699
4526240,5,B0051T46R8,"Ashley is a troubled teen who is sent to live with her Aunt Diane after being released from treatment. Ashley adamantly pushes her aunt out of her life. When she discovers a neglected horse, Ashley seeks Diane's assistance in helping the horse (whom she names Winston) to recover. In doing so, Ashley sees that there is more to life than her own problems. She also sees for the first time that Winston isn't the only one who is broken.

One of my favorite parts about this movie is the example Ashley's Aunt Diane sets for her. Diane is a strong Christian who, while not perfect, seeks to live her life for Christ. Diane never preaches at Ashley, but instead shows her what it means to be a Christ follower through her own actions. Diane's patience, kindness, and compassion do not go unnoticed by Ashley. We also see at the beginning of the movie that Diane is praying for Ashley. It's a fair assumption that Diane continues to pray for her young niece throughout the entire movie and never gives up on Ashley, even though Ashley stumbles and, at times, yields to temptation.

There are some great discussion points in this movie. Ashley struggles with drug abuse. While on probation, she is instructed to have no contact with her boyfriend. Yet, she makes the mistake of disobeying that order. It is a good example of why the choices we make are so important. They not only affect us, but also affect others. While there is some deep subject matter, I found this movie to be appropriate for those ages nine and up.

Saving Winston is slow at times, but the end result is worth it. This movie has heart and shows how, no matter how broken we are, Jesus still loves us and yearns for us to find salvation and peace through Him.

I have added Saving Winston to my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.

We watch a lot of faith-based films, many of which are distributed by PureFlix, and we've liked most of them. However, we stopped this movie after only 20 minutes due to extreme boredom. The dialogue is very slow and seems forced. The acting is rigid and many of the actors, even adults, look like they're performing in a high school play. The background noise is distracting--it sounds like it's being filmed on the shore of an ocean with waves crashing in and seagulls playing. It seriously detracts from the quiet country setting of the movie. The soundtrack is nothing but annoying piano music, if I recall correctly.

They are gorgeous, particularly the horse playing Winston. (Really, though, couldn't they come up with a better name for him than Winston?) However, not being a Christian, I could have done without the God stuff.  If you're into that, you'll probably like it better than I did.  The cinematography is good and the acting is decent, but it's obvious from the beginning where this story is going.  I mean, is there really any doubt that the ""bad girl"" is going to find Jesus and turn her life around?  If you don't know the answer to that question, don't let me spoil the movie for you!  I guess you'll just have to watch it and find out.  Bottom line:  If you're a horse nut and/or Christian you'll probably like it.

Ashley (Victoria Emmons), a drug abusing teen, is arrested in a botched robbery attempt and forced into 6 months of institutionalized rehab. Upon her release, she goes to live with her aunt, a horse trainer, and tries to rekindle her memories from her lost youth of becoming a champion rider.

4526304,2,B0051T46R8,"Another reviewer (""That's the best you could do? Really?"" by Karen ""nanny"" of Ypsilanti, MI) covered this very well.

Unfortunately, many other ""Christian film"" reviews can go in two camps.  The anti-Christian reviewer that hates on faith movies for proselytizing, and the Christians who say ""Praise Jayzus! We got another Christian film!""

I am a Christian who bought this DVD because PureFlix usually puts out some decent films, and I like showing them to my church's youth group.  I've gotta say I was very disappointed. It just seemed like someone wanted to do a film and got bankrolled to do just that.  Turns out in the final credits that is exactly what happened.

Dialogue? Lame. Editing? Not so great.  Too many long musical interludes with ""meaningful"" scenes that we are just supposed to feel so good about. Oh, and a magical conversion experience from a character that I wasn't really convinced wasn't somewhat converted in the first place.

I might try to go back and watch minutes 20-45 where I fell asleep, but I'm not promising anything....

Meanwhile, for a great ""troubled girl saved by saving animals"" movie, you'd be better served watching 2008's ""All Roads Lead Home.""",1369094400,2,1189,4.9646464646464645

4526328,5,B0051T46R8,"Liked the story much. think film portrays that listening is just what it is ""Very important."" We need more of that among adults and children.",1362096000,3,141,4.68
4526329,1,B0051T46R8,"I'm going to skip over the dismally low production value, poor sound quality, boring awful score, filming issues, etc. -- because I could have forgiven all of that had there been anything to the story.

There wasn't.

First off, let's deal with the title and how that relates so little to what happens in the movie. Particularly since I'm a horseperson and that's why I bought it, only to be exceedingly disappointed. They totally bungled that part. Winston is this peripheral character who does not factor into the story much at all. When we first meet Winston, he looks quite well fed for a ""starving"" horse. Which I'm glad he is in real life, but please -- they could have let him roll around in some mud or put some dust on him or have a tangled mane or let him look even slightly pathetic. That part of the story is 0% convincing. This ""saving"" moment doesn't even matter after that. We see her get a little attached to him, but it's far too small of an issue to become the title of the movie. And why did they name him Winston? I think of rich people and privilege, not fighting for one's life. The name is pretty much counterproductive. Big fail on the entire Winston element.

I'm not even a Christian, but I could have told them how to write a better Christian movie with the horse element. 1) Caring for God's amazing creatures is good for us all; we also a duty to help them. 2) Learning to nurture is really good for recovering addicts. Also, keeps one occupied and active and therefore recovering. Isn't it great that God put this in her path? 3) There is tons of great stuff happening in the treatment world when it comes to addicts and horses. Horses are fantastic teachers, especially for building trust and developing good relationships. Incorporate even a little of that huge field of research and practice. Involve faith if you wish -- many such programs do. 4) Also, truly connecting with something she used to love (horses, riding and barn time) and that is very healthy should have been a much bigger deal. They present this surficially. Have her ride much earlier. Have her feel that joy again. Have her take some trail rides and feel soothed by nature and start to connect with another creature again. Have her clean stalls and be fully back in that environment. All of that hard work she used to do can help her be a good person again and relearn that well-placed effort is a lot more rewarding. She can reap the good things she sows. God made this available. The rest of use horsepeople live for that feeling, even ones who don't credit God for it.

Now, onto the drug problem. Anyone who has had an addict in their life knows that this movie glosses over about 99% of what real addiction does to a person and everyone around them. And that is potentially irresponsible, because people who don't know this will watch and think, 'If my grandson/daughter/friend/anyone would just snap out of it and do a little praying, they'd be fine.' 0% reality. Lost the chance here to really educate people about how faith does help many people with addictions and how to understand the recovery process and relate to addicts responsibly. Maybe meet an addict or an addiction counselor or even do some research to get a more realistic view before you make a movie about a topic? Huge thumbs-down to that theme's treatment. How does faith help an addict? How can joining a church community aid someone struggling with this? Did she turn her back on her faith when she started walking down the dark, druggy path? How can she use faith to help keep her on a better path? There was room for a lot more depth in the ""Christianity and the Drug Addict"" theme. Had they filled the long, slow, blank parts of the movie with that, way better advertisement for their faith.

Miscellaneous: I agree with other reviewers about the dialogue and action -- just ridiculously unrealistic. And yes, the aunt is clinically depressed. (Seriously, I thought she needed as much help as the niece. I'm still worried her character will commit suicide.) Definitely, more backstory would have helped immensely.

Overall, don't bother. It's that bad.",1361836800,15,4135,4.634379263301501

4526335,2,B0051T46R8,"""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.""  Saving Winston is unfortunately flat.  Dialogues are stiff and stilted.  ""We just don't talk that way!""  Nothing convinced me that Ashley was a drug addict.  Watch a few minutes of ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" for some convincing drug addict footage.  There were no withdrawal symptoms shown. It was unfortunate for Ashley to have a mono-syllabic dialog.  True, a teen often either says nothing or can't be stopped. Too bad for the actors who did their best with not much to feed on.  Diane gave the impression of a depressed person who needed at least as much help as Ashley.
The ""abandoned"" horse should have had a more plausible scenario.  The parallel between Ashley and her sketch book was not well developed even though the idea was good.  The target audience must be very small.  Too bad because there was a potential for a nice family film.
Some people don't like quiet music, but I enjoyed it.  The photography was artistic.  Hats off to the photography department.
The script should have been re-written to address more precisely the issue of drugs, boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, cause and effect, and such after a scenario improvement.
