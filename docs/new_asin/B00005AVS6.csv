1418935,2,B00005AVS6,"The original Card Captor Sakura (available full and uncut on DVD) is a wonderfully sweet bit of mahou shoujo (magical girl) anime. The ""monster of the day"" premise serves as a backdrop to the real drama of the character interactions among Sakura, her family, and friends.
Unfortunately Cardcaptors doesn't preserve the beauty of the original. There are two major classes of cut. First is the ""potentially objectionable"" material, such as the romantic tinges of the relationship between Sakura and Tomoyo, or a number of cross-generational relationships. None of this is truly ""mature subject matter,"" but American standards for children's TV are a lot more stringent than Japanese. Despite the damage which these cuts do to the story, they're at least understandable.
Far less desirable are the ""keep it moving"" snips. This class itself divides into two subclasses: on the one hand, Sakura is diminished and Li is emphasised in order to change Sakura from protagonist. On the other, many of the more moving character moments are compressed or eliminated to hurry on to the ""action"" sequences of capturing the cards. The end result is to change a cute character-focussed show into a mildly frightening or violent action show.
Despite the damage, some of the genius of the original creation still shows through, so I can't entirely condemn this release for very young children. However, if your child is age six or so, I'd highly recommend the uncut subtitled version as an excellent show, a good reason to improve reading skills, and a chance to use the more controversial elements as a jumping-off point for discussion. Watch it with your child--you'll be drawn in yourself.",998524800,5,1674,5.113138686131387
1418936,2,B00005AVS6,"If you like CardCaptors seriously consider getting CardCaptor Sakura. CCS has more character development and better voice acting. Its characters are much more endering and real with their crushes and family life. Als CCS is in the correct episode order not the order Nelvana has (8,12,23,3...). Your child will love it much more,(it isn't the action paced, pokemon clone they made it to be, but a sight to love) So it is within your best intrest to get CCS insted of CC. Plus your chil will learn to read more with subtitles a plus!",993513600,5,532,4.670212765957447

7935979,5,B00005AVS6,"Ah yes, I remember watching Cardcaptors when it was still on Kids WB. It was my favorite show, as well as Pokemon was. This is a great DVD, it has 3 exciting episodes on it:

""Dragon Slayer""
Nikki buys a strange old book at the bookstore that you can write inside. The book is actually a Clow Card!
Meanwhile, Sakura captures the Big card. After capturing it, Sakura, Li, and company start to see weird things. A lady pass over the bridge, animals with swirly eyes and are growing wings. It's the work of the Create card! Everything Nikki writes become real!

""The Switch""
Sakura captures the Change card, but before it was captured, it switched Li and Kero. Now Li is Kero, and Kero is Li, they have switched bodies!
They have to stay like this for 24 hours and meet back at the park to fix the problem, or else they're stuck like this forever. But can either one handle being the other for an entire day?

""Ice Breaker""
Reedington Elementry goes on a field trip to an ice rink. It's been really cold lately. Li and Meilin aren't used to cold weather, so they're really bundled-up. At the ice rink, it just seems to get colder and colder. First, Meilin freezes before Li's eyes, then Madison freezes before Sakura. Suddenly, everyone freezes. Can Li and Sakura capture it, or will they freeze too?

Very exciting episodes. You will not want to miss a second!
I really love ""The Switch"" it is just so funny. And ""Ice Breaker"" is really, really exiting, so is ""Dragon Slayer""
All who remember watching Cardcaptors, I totally recommend this DVD!
Never heard of the show? You should definantly check it out!",1232409600,,1604,4.539792387543253
7935980,3,B00005AVS6,Three stars tells you it's just an average movie. The manga series is better imo.,1067212800,,81,4.466666666666667
7935981,4,B00005AVS6,"This video is pretty cool. (I don't have it but I have seen the shows on Kids WB.) I mean if I got this I would probley be watching it all the time. Even if its in japanese or english.
What does dubbed mean?? Well all I can tell you is this. This contains three videos.
Dragon Slayer: When one of Sakura's friend's named Nikki who found a old book at the bookstore, Nikki writes a story and then...the characters come alive! Now Sakura has to do something to capture the Create Card! When Sakura finnaly figured what to do, she uses the Big Card to defeat a dragon. Then she used other cards to defeat the rest of the characters.
Then she captured the Create Card when Nikki was sleeping. The next morning Nikki couldn't find the book but oh well.
The Switch: When Sakura was at the park trying to capture the Change Card, both Li and Kero grabbed onto the Change Card at the same time. Sakura captured the Change Card but Li and Kero switched bodys! On this episode you have to find out if they will switch back.
Ice Breaker: When Sakura and the rest of Sakura's class went to a ice skating trip, the temp. started to go down to zero as the classmates started to freeze up! Sakura and Li face the Freeze Card. So Sakura trys to find a way to capture the Freeze! What will happen to Sakura and Li? Also, on this episode you have to figure it out to.
Well I am a big fan of Cardcaptor Sakura and Cardcaptors, thats for sure. Well enjoy!",1049932800,,1435,4.202898550724638
7935982,1,B00005AVS6,"I remember that day when Kids WB announced that it would be showing a new anime series. I was so excited, and when it came on, wow! Beautiful animation, fun character, and all around great!
Then I bought a video of Cardcaptor Sakura.
Now I'm filled with rage at Nelvana. How dare they do this to such a wonderful series? First thing, which I could live with alone, is the name changes. How do you get Madison out of Tomoyo? Julian out of Yukito? It makes no sense! At least in Pokemon, some of the name translations made sense (Kasumi, which means ""cloud"" was changed to Misty, for example). Next, the out of order. It makes no sense! One day, Sakura is using a card to capture a different one, the next, she's capturing that very same one she used! Please! Finally, the general edits. When I watched the water card episode after buying the video, I was shrieking at the TV non-stop. For example, they had edited it so much! They took out everything that wasn't directly related to the capture of the card. They made a prearranged meeting of Yukito and Sakura a coincidental meeting of Julian and Sakura.
In conclusion, don't buy this. Buy the unedited version. You'll be so much more satisfied.",998611200,3,1195,4.537037037037037
