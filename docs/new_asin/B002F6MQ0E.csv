3920821,5,B002F6MQ0E,"This DVD is very good. My kids loved it. It shows lot of animals in their natural habitats. I like the playing time options in the menu, a 5 minute segment and a 10 minute segment. It is very easy to restrict the viewing time this way. My kids watched this when they were about 2 yrs old. I didn't see any difference between the Regular and Grow with me option. My kids loved the World animal song also. They sing it even now.",1307664000,,426,4.083333333333333
3920822,3,B002F6MQ0E,"I have a couple of complaints about the quality and effort put into this video. Like another reviewer noted, in some cases you can't see the whole animal. How is a toddler to learn what the animal looks like if they only show a part of it? It confuses them. For instance, they show a part of a chameleon, and my toddler keeps on saying ""crocodile"" or ""frog"" whenever it comes up becomes those animals are more familiar to him and since he can't see the whole animal, he can't tell the difference. On the same vein, they show a manatee, and even though they show the whole animal, my toddler says ""seal"". As yet another reviewer noted, they should have also kept it simple in naming the animals, as in ""monkey"" instead of ""snow monkey"". Also, there is a misidentification: What they call a ""llama"" is really a guanaco. So, on top of the poor editing and choice of nouns, they mislabel the animals. Having said all that, I gave it three stars because my toddler really enjoys this DVD and it keeps him entertained.",1307404800,,1012,4.446236559139785
3920823,5,B002F6MQ0E,"I got the Baby Einstein 26 DVD bundle from another place and that had the 2001 version of this DVD. This one is the latest video version and is highly recommended for kids. My 2yr old loves the video. Product is a bit overpriced (50% compared to price of 26 DVD bundle), but for now will rate only for the product and not for the price.",1305417600,,336,4.106060606060606
3920824,3,B002F6MQ0E,"I like this DVD because it has tons of animals, however one thing I bought it for was because supposedly it has a ""grow with me"" feature, meaning that when the baby is old enough they show and say the name of the animal, however no matter if I choose level 1 or 2, the dvd shows the word and says the animal's name, so there is no level 1! My son is 17 months old so it does not matter because we would not use the level 1 anyway. Another thing I did not like was that they are very specific about saying the name of the animal like: clown fish, I would prefer if they just said: ""fish"" and then they say: ""snow monkeys"" again I would have liked if they just said: monkeys.",1287273600,3,673,3.9558823529411766

3920826,5,B002F6MQ0E,I like this and enjoy quality time with my son as he gets a kick out of it and I like the fact that it is teaching him something at the same time. Thumbs up.,1264896000,,157,3.5142857142857142
3920827,1,B002F6MQ0E,"If all you want is a video full of bright colors then this is a great film. Otherwise the quality's not there anymore! The old Baby Einstein videos were of a different caliber. The wonderful music we all appreciated is gone & the puppets are so boring even my 18 months-old won't watch it!
I believe any T.V for children under 4-5 is harmful. So if I want to make an exception it's with a good quality product & this is far from being one.
The feature song is dull & the people singing it are mumbling.
Technically speaking, the filming is an aberration. Is this amateur filming????? Throughout the video you barely see ONE COMPLETE ANIMAL!!! Most of the time it's parts of animals: A fox without a head, the eye of... a lizard??? I don't know. Feels like someone patched together unused footages from another good movie. How can you introduce animals to toddlers with only parts of their body???? Even worse, they would name one animal & then skip the next three... Nothing in this video makes sense.
& let us not forget the french version: The lady speaking french has a weird accent. Avoid!!!
I truly believe the whole package is harmful & I'm surprised there's Disney's name on this one... It's an embarrassment! If I had the choice I would return it & for the rest of you, stick with the old B.E videos.",1262131200,2,1308,4.476987447698745
3920828,3,B002F6MQ0E,"Our 18-month old has loved the World Music video for most of her life, so we were eager to get this one. However, she just doesn't enjoy this one as much. She doesn't really laugh at the puppet shows on this one--they don't really make sense. It just doesn't seem to display the level of thought and effort that the other video did.

She does watch this video, but it rarely keeps her interest all the way through the way World Music still does.",1259625600,,445,4.2976190476190474
3920829,5,B002F6MQ0E,"My daughter has enjoyed watching all the Baby Einstein DVDs since she was an infant.  I wasn't sure this would do the trick, but I was wrong.  I bought this a few weeks ago.  She's now 20 months, and she watches the video the whole way through and loves to name all the animals.  There's also a setting for older kids to describe what the animals are doing...Sheep running, etc.  She watches this a few times a week and never tires of it.",1258416000,11,438,4.228915662650603

8368812,3,B002F6MQ0E,"I liked the video but I would have liked it to contain more animals. If it contained a little more info on the animals, it would have made it more valuable to the family.",1389571200,,170,4.029411764705882
8368813,3,B002F6MQ0E,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child. I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I am unhappy with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and implying that this will make babies smarter!! These videos may be okay for kids, but tv/videos are generally are NOT good for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%, and 3) consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems. Interestingly, there is even some odds increase for bullying later on, for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2 and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2. Of course, I realize that this is probably not realistic for most people. There are studies that recommend preferably sitting with your child and watching t.v. together rather than just propping them in front of the tv by themselves, to make the experience more enriching and interactive (within reason of course and not longer than the recommended time). But I wanted to put this information out so that other parents and caregivers could make better informed parenting decisions. Maybe it will encourage some to limit television usage for babies and children and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time! Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance. Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1316649600,,2249,5.07027027027027
8368814,5,B002F6MQ0E,"This is a great learning dvd to show more animals, images and videos are amazing too! def recommend to anyone whose child loves animals.",1313798400,,136,4.708333333333333
