5730382,5,B00CMQIE26,"I am really enjoying the Ripcord Series 1 and 2 that I ordered as soon as they were available.  Ripcord was a one of a kind series and still enjoyable for me today.  The picture and sound quality is excellent and the entire episode with opening and closing credits and theme is all there. This program about skydivers for hire has plenty of action, good guest stars, and goes over well even today.",1383091200,3,397,4.424657534246576
5730383,1,B00CMQIE26,"The content of the DVD is great.  I was a professional skydiver for many years, influenced by watching this show in the early 60s.  It's great to see the program again.

Now the bad news, the DVD Is DANGEROUS!  It completely ruined my TV.  The episode selection screen is very dark with the word RIPCORD in big white letters.  I fell asleep watching the disk.  At the end of the episode, the disk reverted to the menu screen.  When I woke of 4 hours later the word RIPCORD was burned permanently into my TV screen.  It is visible in the background of just about every scene displayed by the set.  IF YOU WATCH THIS DISK, STAY AWAKE!",1382486400,4,632,4.3247863247863245
5730384,5,B00CMQIE26,"I grew up with this show and forgot how goot is was not to mention some of the shows were by Ivan Tors who's studio I grew up near here in North Miami... When on adds up the stuff he did like Flipper, Sea Hunt, the water scenes on Thunderball, he had a lot to do with my childhood..;)  It's so nice to see a show with imagination not to mention the cool 60's stuff..lt's funny as sometimes one has to go to the past to find progress... Wish they made more shows like this and less politically corect garbage like they try to force feed us these days....Thanks Amazon for giving us a choice.....",1379721600,,594,4.165217391304348
5730385,5,B00CMQIE26,"Buyers of the ""Ripcord Complete Season 1"" DVD set will also want to pick up Season 2 of the exciting 1961-63 television series that featured the thrilling aerial adventures of skydivers-for-hire Ted McKeever (played by Larry Pennell) and Jim Buckley (played by Ken Curtiss, who gained fame as ""Festus"" on ""Gunsmoke"").

The ""Ripcord Complete Season 2"" DVD set contains 38 episodes on five disks housed in two traditional DVD cases (three disks in one case, two in the other) which are packaged in a nice-but-superfluous cardboard box that features the same front-cover artwork as the individual cases. Unlike the first case of Season 1, in which all of the disks are mounted on a single spindle and from which they tend to fall off and rattle around inside, the Season 2 first case has individual hinged plastic ""pages"" to keep the disks separate. It's a much better packaging technique, with less likelihood of scratching the disks.

Each episode runs about 23 minutes or so, in full-screen format, of course. I didn't see it mentioned in the Product Description, but the Season 2 episodes are in full color, as opposed to the black-and-white ones of Season 1. I actually prefer B&W for old TV shows--early color shows are way too saturated and unnatural to my eye. Anyway, although I've just sampled a few of them to make sure the disks work in my DVD player, they're great fun to see again after so many years. They're definitely corny compared to modern (but not necessarily better) standards. The actors' performances are restrained but competent. Of course, the real stars of the show are the sensational skydiving stunts, which were filmed as they happened without tricks or special effects. As in Season 1, some of the plot twists are a little strained as the writers tried to convincingly feature skydiving as the way to resolve the most unlikely situations. The episodes are fairly sharp and crisp, given the characteristics of early television color processes, and seem a bit too contrasty, but they're definitely up to the standards of the time. The dialog in most cases is clear and comprehensible, a relative rarity these days.

If you're a fan of the good old days of television, you can't go wrong with ""Ripcord."" I recommend both Season 1 and Season 2 DVD sets most enthusiastically.",1378944000,10,2299,4.88974358974359
5730386,5,B00CMQIE26,"Well having purchased season one which unfortunately doubled up on ""Elegy For Hero"" leaving us without ""Sentence Of Death"" I was pleasantly surprised to fInd season two in tact. All full colour episodes and just as good as the first season. An exciting series worth watching time and again. I am so glad that TGG released this great series. I just hope they can find ""Sentence of Death"" to give us all 76 episodes. Larry and Ken make for a likeable duo and the guest stars are always a treat.",1378252800,3,492,4.477777777777778
5730387,5,B00CMQIE26,"Same as my review of season 1.  The quality is great, just like watching the show on TV. Its great to see the show that got me hooked on skydiving.",1377475200,,147,3.9
5730388,5,B00CMQIE26,"I found out about this series while browsing a site that sold bootleg DVDs. My curiosity piqued,I bought a copy and although the quality was horrible I liked what I saw. This may be a rather obscure series, but its an excellent one, and I highly recommend it. its good clean fun the entire family will enjoy. I look forward to getting this series this August (My Birthday Month) The crappy version I have is missing 10 episodes, and I look forward to seeing all the episodes in pristine condition. I'll be more than happy to send the 'boots to the bar i own. it's called ""The Workbench"" and all who go there get HAMMERED!",1368835200,5,621,4.408695652173913
5730389,4,B00CMQIE26,Very nice set with good quality video. The packaging uses the three disc stacked together which can cause the disc's to become loose.,1410566400,,133,4.826086956521739
5730390,3,B00CMQIE26,"Although these videos are from 1962, their stories are still relevant because skydiving is about the same as it was then.",1409097600,,121,4.809523809523809
5730391,5,B00CMQIE26,"Great entertainment. I did not realize that the second season was in color. However, it seems clear that the writers were having to stretch to come up with plotlines.",1407369600,,166,4.758620689655173

Comes in great condition, found a rare episode and fell in love with the idea of skydiving and helpging people out!
You need Season #1 also of course, great fun!",1399939200,,298,4.75
5730394,3,B00CMQIE26,"If you enjoy a lot of the TV series from the TV shows hay days 50s, 60s, and
70s this is a pretty good series.",1396656000,,110,3.44
5730395,5,B00CMQIE26,"What a great blast from the past! Enjoyed watching this series as a kid on Saturday afternoons and now I can do so again! It's dated to be sure, but I actually find it much more enjoyable than much of what is on today. There was actual story lines involved along with acting and production values not interrupted by more commercials than programming.",1393027200,,350,4.571428571428571
5730396,4,B00CMQIE26,"I enjoyed this series when it was originally on.  This DVD set has no subtitles and has NOT been ""digitally"" enhanced, so it looks like an old rerun.  You can see a young Tim Matheson in season 2.",1392768000,,196,4.131578947368421
5730397,4,B00CMQIE26,"This is the second season of ""Ripcord"" and season two is in color!  In case you are not familiar with the show it is centered on two skydivers for hire, fresh from the military who set up business in it is believed to be Southern California.  The shows get rather samey after a while, but it will give you a chance to see Gunsmoke's Festus (Ken Curtis) before he went to Gunsmoke.  Also see a constantly snarling Burt Reynolds in one of his first TV appearances.  Good light entertainment.",1389484800,,489,4.46067415730337

8583504,4,B00CMQIE26,"I can remember watching this syndicated series with my father.  It was shown Thursday nights at 7PM on NBC in New York.
We were both utterly fascinated with the skydiving scenes, something we had not seen before.  This is another one of those series that I never expected to see again.  I have the first season as well but this is superior because it is in color.  I enjoy so many of the old B/W series but with so many shots of the blue skies this series belonged in color.
I have only watched the first episode so far, but the picture quality seems fine.  (The episode is relatively silly with the two heroes having to rescue a smartass and annoying little boy and his dog who just seem to wander in and out of a raging forest fire.)
The series starred Larry Pennell, an actor who did tons of tv work during the '60s and '70s and Ken Curtis a/k/a/ Festus Haggen on Gunsmoke.  It is interesting to see Curtis in a modern role but I'm not sure how he did it since this was just about the time he started appearing on Gunsmoke.
My main complaint is the packaging of this set, three DVDs are stuck on one prong and not stuck well as one of the DVDs was loose when I received it, very poor packaging.
But the show is fun and enjoyable, another relic and pleasant memory from the early 1960s.",1478822400,,1288,4.236734693877551
8583505,5,B00CMQIE26,"""The Hunter"" episode has audio on this set.  Haven't really checked anything else, when you buy the set that includes both season 1 and 2, ""The Hunter"" episode has no audio so if you buy that set you will have to buy this one too so you can have that episode with audio.",1473120000,,270,4.09433962264151
8583506,4,B00CMQIE26,"Season 2 is a lot like season 1, but with a lot of episodes seemingly being repetitive.  I really liked the first season, but the plot lines really start to take their toll about halfway through this season.  The leads actors are very likeable and play their parts well.  One benefit is that this season is in color.  Kids will love the series and parents too, since nothing was ever objectionable in the scripts.",1468281600,,413,4.54054054054054

8583508,3,B00CMQIE26,Typical 60s TV adventure series. Bought it since I hadn't watched it regularly if at all as a kid and it seems to have missed the syndication boat.  Also I skydive so its cool to watch folks jump the old stuff.  I jumped a round chute twice in the 80s but not many follks outside the military have today.,1444348800,,304,4.135593220338983
