2471886,3,B000CRR3MY,"The book is way smaller than I expected it to be, but ok for the low price paid.  However, it will be a great stocking stuffer for kids.  With that sad, I wish I had ordered a few more.",1383955200,,185,3.717948717948718

2471889,4,B000CRR3MY,"My great-grandson loves Clifford, and this video is great for him as he has a new baby sister.  He watches the whole movie. It holds his interest, and could learn a little about having a new baby around.",1313625600,,203,4.342105263157895

2471891,5,B000CRR3MY,"In this DVD we are introduced to Jetta's baby brother Cosmo, (who walks and talks  almost as soon as he's born, but that's beside the point) and kids are shown how to handle jealousy and how it can be fun looking after a baby/ giant red dog/ rambunctious rabbit. The stories are: Baby Makes Four * A Job Well Read * Who Me, Jealous? * A bunny in a Haystack * Babysitter Blues * He's Wonderful - Mr. Bleakman * Getting to Know You * No Baths For Cleo. It's a solid contribution to the Clifford collection.",1262304000,5,504,4.195876288659794
2471892,5,B000CRR3MY,I bought this title particularly for the story about the new baby to help my boys feel prepared for the arrival of their new sibling.  It gently explores a big sister's jealousy of her new little brother and then she discovers that she has a valuable and helpful place in her family as she adopts her role as Big Sister.  Very cute and well done.,1206748800,3,346,4.3076923076923075
8101235,5,B000CRR3MY,"My son is obsessed with ""Doggie"" for the time being. It's tough to find anything Clifford related in the stores. I guess because he's no longer on the air?? Anyway, I bought him tons of things on Amazon for Christmas. However, we had to open this the second we got it. He has watched it about 50 times in a row, but still watches it like it's his first time. More Clifford please.",1480291200,,380,4.219178082191781

8101237,4,B000CRR3MY,"My 2 year old loves Clifford!  We bought this when Clifford went off the air.  The only sad thing is that they don't play the song before each episode,  which is my son's favorite part!",1475107200,,185,4.228571428571429

8101241,5,B000CRR3MY,"Great movie. We saw it in the theater when my daughter was little & she was a big fan of Clifford. Makes me cry at the end as it's dedicated to John Ritter, when passed away shortly after wrapping production of this film. It's a classic children's movie, the characters and lessons are great for very small and on up. Our family still watches with young nieces & nephews. We love Clifford.",1424217600,,389,4.416666666666667
