I had previously watched the film on YouTube and was looking for a better copy with clearer images. Unbelievable and annoying as it may sound, I spent almost 20 euros to get hold of this scam copy which was definitely worse than the one I had already seen. Everybody beware!!",1390780800,,409,4.466666666666667
8246501,1,B0012KLSZS,"While I agree with the previous author regarding the importance of Die Strasse/The Street as an important work of 1920s German cinema, this print is the worst one that I have ever seen.  It looks like a fifth generation video recorded on a DVD-R disc.  Several scenes are incomplete, and the important scene in which a streetwalker turns into a skeleton is missing. That scene is also missing from a previously released video version.  Save your money and wait for a restored version.",1281398400,7,484,4.807228915662651
8246502,4,B0012KLSZS,"Also known by its original German title, ""Die Strasse"", (which means ""The Street"") this German silent film is a good example of the genre and style of movies made in Germany during the 1920s.  The trends in modern art influenced German filmmakers in particular to use artistic styles in films to convey moods and feelings with visual effects, light and shadow, and expressive acting.  While there are many good examples of this style, all varying in degrees of intensity, distortion and expression, ""The Street"" is a film that is easily watched and enjoyed, even though it seeks to convey the dark side of life and human nature.

As is often the case with Expressionist films, the story is quite simple, meaning not many intertitles to explain actions or convey dialogue are necessary, thereby enabling the director, cameraman and actors to focus intently on the visual expression of thoughts, concepts, moods and feelings.  The story of ""The Street"" is about a middle-aged man who finds his comfortable middle-class life excruciatingly dull and boring, and as he looks down on the bustling city street from his window, he imagines the exciting, glamorous and happy life he has been missing.  When he does venture out one night to explore the city's nightlife, his naivety makes him easy prey for the unscrupulous characters who dominate the nighttime street scene.  A prostitute and her pimp take advantage of his gullible nature, and a series of events lead to murder - a crime for which he is framed.  Fortunately, the words of a small child - an exceptionally endearing character in this film - reveal the true culprits and free the poor man, allowing him to walk the long way home and up the stairs to his home, deeply remorseful and no doubt much wiser.

The German actors and director of ""The Street"" all had significant careers in German cinema, some extending into the sound era, and silent film enthusiasts will be interested to know that Nosferatu's Max Schreck plays the old blind man who accompanies the charming small child, although without his vampire make-up he is hardly recognizable!

""The Street"" has much to offer in Expressionist style for the discerning viewer, such as many visual expressions and camera tricks which those familiar with the `language' of expressionist cinema will be able to appreciate.  Even for those who are not well-versed in this cinematic language, the story is good and entertaining, and clearly conveys a certain message.

However, the quality of this DVD leaves something to be desired, since it is only a DVD-R recording from a Video Yesteryear VHS, without menu or chapters, and not even a jacket in the DVD case.  The picture quality is not as sharp as many restored silent films, and often the faces are washed out and completely white.  Apart from this, the film is good and complete, running its full 100 minutes, and the organ accompaniment by Rosa Rio is very good and fitting to the scenes and moods.  Being a visual medium, one hopes for a better, restored version one day, but in the meantime it is good to at least be able to view this movie which is regarded as a landmark in a certain genre of German Expressionist cinema, namely `the street films' highlighting the degradation of certain lifestyles.",1272758400,4,3264,4.878842676311031
