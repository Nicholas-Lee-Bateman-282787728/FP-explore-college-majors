8165981,3,B000M32TP4,It was not the video I had on vhs tape. The tape I had showed Scot Schmidt jumping off cliffs and other crazy things. The video was however entertaining,1462924800,,152,4.275862068965517
8165982,5,B000M32TP4,"Great movie, great recording.  We got it for the part at Grand Targee.  Just lost ""Slim"" to cancer.  We miss him.",1395532800,,113,4.285714285714286
8165983,5,B000M32TP4,"My parents bought this movie when I was about 3 years old and has always been my favorite ski movie. I love the cheesy 80s synth music and all the neon! Warren Miller is hilarious. I'm always crying with laughter during the ski lift bloopers segment. If you're a skier, do your self a favor and buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.",1391040000,,337,4.365079365079365
8165984,5,B000M32TP4,If you are a Warren Miller classic fan who grew up watching his movies this is a must have. One of the last great ones that are available to see.,1292457600,,145,3.8666666666666667
8165985,5,B000M32TP4,"Ever since I was a little girl I had endlessly watched Extreme Winter every ski season. Warren Miller is an amazing director and commentator, and I am so glad he has come as far as he has. This movie is a great blast from the past and to this day, over 20 years later, I still watch the movie before every ski season. Keep bringing on the good times Warren! PS. The 80's retro music is still a favorite!",1203811200,2,403,4.113924050632911
