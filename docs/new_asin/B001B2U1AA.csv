3480183,3,B001B2U1AA,"It was ok, should have saved my money and rented it, even if it cost more than a Redbox. Not as funny as the Holy Grail and can be offensive if you don't have a thick skin.",1509926400,,172,3.675675675675676

3480186,5,B001B2U1AA,"Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" satirizes the first millennium messianic impulse in Roman-occupied Judea. The humor is classic Monty Python and absolutely hilarious. Certain elements of this film make it inappropriate for children under 12 (nudity, language), but those over 15 will enjoy it and it's great fun for dorm parties.",1507852800,,327,5.431372549019608
3480187,5,B001B2U1AA,"A typical topical Python parody.  It's like a long poem, except without the meters and rhyming verses.  Very clever;  excellent writing, acting and staging.

3480216,5,B001B2U1AA,"As a Christian, I love this movie.  As a Monty Python fan, I think they have better stuff.  However, being a Christian, I'm able to relate to this one in a way that I can't with the other movies.  I find it to be a fantastic commentary on the hypocrisy that has been so heavily prevalent for the past 2,000 years in the overall Christian church.  The way Brian's followers react to him reflects how Jesus' followers have been.  They kill one who speaks against him, even though he tells them not to.  They repeat his words and claim to agree, but they behave in a way antithetical to it.  It also has some fun references to different Biblical figures and settings of the time.

Concerning it's entertainment values, it's a fairly decent film.  When I first saw the film before becoming a Christian, the space alien scene was my absolute favorite.  I thought that was the one thing superior to anything else they'd done.  The stoning scene, the final song, the sermon on the mount scene, and a few other scenes are fairly good Monty Python sketches.  However, the film is much more of a drama than any of Monty Python's other films.  Their real strength is with sketches, which this film, when comparing it to their other films, is lacking.  It is their one film that really holds together best as a single whole, has much more developed and complex characters, and a much more developed storyline.  So many might like it for that reason.

When talking about the four Monty Python films, this one was the one that I liked least at first.  However, having gained appreciation for it after becoming a Christian, I'm able to put it on equal par with their other films.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is probably my favorite movie of theirs, as it has an overall story, but it really is a series of comedic sketches.  It also takes standard Monty Python, and places all of it into a medieval setting.  And Now For Something Completely Different is standard Monty Python, where they took some of their best sketches, and redid them with some improvements made.  The Meaning of Life is also a series of sketches, but they structure it thematically to be about the stages of a person's life.

All in all, I recommend it for Christians or Monty Python completists, and I do think it was a well-made film.  However, it is not for everyone.",1492992000,,2331,4.537170263788969

I was skeptical whether or not a film such as this would even benefit from a high resolution transfer, as I'm sure this was not a high budget production to begin with.  Seeing as my expectations were low on the video quality department I was pleasantly suprised at some of the improvements. The color palette was greatly improved (nice, blue skies in the outdoor scenes) and there was a lot of added detail without too much (any?) removal of film grain.  I've only watched the work print outtakes, which I'd seen before, but for the cost (under $7.00), if you're a fan of the film, I'm not sure there's any room to complain or wish for more.",1475971200,,706,4.457364341085271

It is a time of great excitement in the area as a rebellion groups attempt to push the Romans out and later on Brian himself is mistaken for a messiah figure.

The film parodies the Hollywood Biblical epic films and also satirizes stories from the Gospels as it parallels the origins of Christianity. To be sure, this film is hilarious.

The Blu-ray also comes with numerous bonus features including making-of material and two audio commentaries.

My  DVD was not captioned.  This Sunday, my  younger expressed a desire to see the  film and asked to borrow it.  I checked  out Amazon and  found there was a captioned  version. (all the rest of my Python films  are provided with captions}.  I decided to  give her  my DVD and order a new disc with the  captions, after all it was listed at $10.21, so  be a sport.  The description on the Amazon page  only  mentioned a single disc version with no extras  listed.  Imagine my  great surprise and pleasure  when  my movie arrived and I  discovered a dual disc version with loads of extras.  There's nothing I could add to any review of this  film.  It's highly irreverent humor is well nigh perfect,  If you like this  kind of English humor, you'll love the film. if not, you won't  I found that Monty Python was an acquired taste.  You must view any of their  films to fully understand  exactly what is  going on, from  ""Brave Sir  Robin in the Grail  film  to  Brian Cohen who cannot get his latin  verbs quite right in this one,  Monty :Python is as  funny today as when I  first understood it so many years ago",1441152000,,1287,4.258474576271187

3480372,3,B001B2U1AA,"This was bought years ago as a Criterion DVD. Just like the VHS tape from years before that, it did not include the complete film which I remembered watching as a rented VHS tape from years before which had the suicide squad song, and the rebels actually getting to Pilate's wife (played by a burly man who then proceeds to beat them up).

More importantly, just as Meaning of Life was preceded by The Crimson Permanent Assurance in theatres, so Life of Brian is supposed to be preceded with ""Away From It All"", a mock travelogue film by John Cleese which is pretty funny (at present you can find it on Youtube). This too is missing from everything everywhere.

Anyway, the deleted scenes are on the Criterion DVD, but not the original footage; rather there is some B&W amateur filming which was all they could find at the time. I wouldn't buy any subsequent version until I am assured the missing scenes and supporting feature are restored.

All in all, it's a good film even without the missing bits, though the pacing isn't 100%. I don't know why people are calling it the funniest film of all time, but I'm glad others enjoy it that much, and I pity them for having seen so few movies to have reached that verdict.",1434240000,,1218,4.502262443438914

It does, of course, require a particular sense of humor - but if you're a Python fan you already know that.  My 14 year old thought it was brilliant and hysterically funny.  My wife, on the other hand, has no use for it at all. Like father, like son, I suppose.

It seems I never get tired of it! And my son, (a very different generation indeed) finds this British wit hilarious as well, we wholeheartedly agree on this...one of the very rare things, believe that! It's clean fun. If a bit blasphemous, (ha ha). Review time:

A man called Brian...not a very impressive name for, well, the supposed son of God. But Brian is just a young man trying to make the leap from adolescence to manhood and escape his mother's skirts (an ugly, but loving harlot played by Terry Jones) He unwittingly stumbles into circumstance after circumstance, that, - even though he tries to convince everyone he is just an ordinary guy- seems to thoroughly convince everyone that he is the second coming...a hero to save the masses, to brake the yoke of the Roman empire on the oppressed. The side busting antics are still bringing tears of laughter to my eyes and I've probably seen it, like, a hundred times! Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, the core group of MP are all here and in their heyday. This IS comedy at it's best. And no gross outs, no farts,  no F bombs every other word...just plain Ol' brilliance.",1418860800,,1337,4.7094017094017095
3480417,5,B001B2U1AA,"This was Monty Python's most outrageous, iconoclastic, and best film of all.  First things, first: it is very flippant about the religion it is addressing which certainly will offend some.  If you have a sense of humor in this realm, then read on:
The plot, if there are any plots in M.Python films, has 'Brian' in place of Jesus with all other characters re-shaped.  They show, very roughly, the events surrounding Jesus with very liberal interpretations for comedic effect.  For instance, men being processed by the oppressive Roman occupiers are given a choice: crucifixion or going to an exotic tropical island...their choice.  And, many of them, given a choice, choose crucifixion.  They also skewer Roman society, the present Mideast, and Christian and Jewish history.  Again, you have to be amienable to seeing comedy in religious history or this just doesn't work for you.
One final note in its defense: the parodies and spoofing is harmless and well-intended; at no time should you be offended...but everyone has different thresholds in this and their own viewpoint...",1418774400,,1077,5.155172413793103

3480421,5,B001B2U1AA,"One of the greatest parodies ever made in a zany style, with apologies and due respect to all Christians!
On that famous midnight clear, three wise men enter a manger led by the Star of the East to find an infant called Brian...they are obviously in the wrong manger! Brian is played by Graham Chapman and he is destined to become the Messiah. He is always in the shadow of the `other guy' from Galilee. The scene of the Sermon on the Mount' is extremely hilarious. Brian becomes a witness to that sermon along with his mother but gets a place so far away that he cannot hear a word of what Jesus is saying. It is interpreted by people standing close by who are as dumb as him as they hear phrases like `Blessed are the Cheese Makers'!
Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at a crowded execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Instead of uttering the last six words, Brian has  to hear an English cheer-up song ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""
The entire Monty Python troupe (Chapman, Jones, Cleese, Palin, Idle and Gilliam) are there, playing multiple roles - some of them being Loretta, Biggus Dickus, Deadly Dirk, Casts the First Stone and Intensely Dull Youth.

Life of Brian is not only a tongue-in-cheek mockery of religion but a twist on the theist myths as seen through the eyes of Brian who wants to be a hero but finds out that it is all meaningless nonsense that earns him only bunch of imbecile followers  who are seeking to earn a little retribution through his sacrifices. Brian is the unintended messiah, the man who fell in to his aspirtaions for fame while Jesus sought it out.
Life of Brian has a lot to say about religion,martyrs and dictators and the futile living exercise where you are either a sheep or a shepherd. Monty Python's zany sense of comedy shows up when Brian is saved by alien ships from Star Wars' series. This film will also go down as a masterpiece from the Monty Python group.",1417478400,,1986,4.511111111111111

This package (""The Immaculate Edition"" Blu-ray) contains some really fun extras including a list of deleted scenes that I really think most people will agree would have made the whole film better had they been left in ... per the commentary, they were deleted mostly just to speed up the film & reduce the running time, rather than for any artistic / story-telling reason. Seems so funny to me that they were so concerned about our short attention spans back then, whilst in today's ADHD world we regularly receive and watch 3 hour long motion pictures! :-D

The movie is filled with great scenes.  Brian encounters an ex leper:  ""Half a denarii for my bleeding life's story?""
""There's no pleasing some people.""
""That's what Jesus said!""

In one incredible scene Brian is rescued in a most improbable manner after accidentally stumbling off the ledge of a tower, ending up in an increasingly bizarre chain of circumstances.

The best scene has to be the Latin language lesson delivered to Brian by a Roman soldier.  ""Now write that a hundred times or I'll cut your balls off.""  Utterly brilliant.  Even people who do not appreciate the Flying Circus would likely still enjoy this film, but the target audience is recovering Catholics, reformed Christians, and anyone else who spent a good portion of their childhood paying attention in Sunday School.

Same with the ""Peoples Front of Judea"" and ""Who threw that stone"".  What catapults this movie into true greatness, though, is not the comic genius.  The greatness of this movie is how it commends one to consider religion in context. For example, the scene where Brian is chased and loses a shoe. If that is not prescient and illustrative, I do not know what is. This movie can be appreciated on so many different levels for so many different reasons by so many different people, that it almost defies belief.

3480494,5,B001B2U1AA,"In the estimation of this reviewer ""Life of Brian"" is the best of all the Monty Python films. While the Holy Grail movie is popular with many and is what in many ways put the Pythons on the map, at the time of its release they were just coming into their own. ""Life of Brian"" tells a story seamlessly and shows the maturity of a group of individuals who have acted together for years and know
each other's strengths and weaknesses intimately. One of the major issues surrounding this film from the time of its release has been the question of whether or not it is blasphemous. As a Christian, I find nothing offensive about it. Although it is set in first-century Judaea and is about a man (Brian) whose followers began to think of him as a messiah, there is almost nothing about Jesus in the film. While it is true that Brian was born at the same time as Jesus (in the next stable, as a matter of fact), the focus is entirely on Brian and his life. (At one point there is a scene that takes place at the outskirts of the crowd gathered to hear the Sermon on the Mount. By the time Jesus's statements are relayed to those on the periphery, the message comes out, ""Blessed are the cheese maker."" Other than this rather indirect encounter, Jesus is rarely even referenced in the film.)

In some ways its setting in first-century Palestine is tangential to its message. Consider, for example, the scene in which a discussion is taking place related to the various ""liberation fronts"" (e.g., the People's Front of Judaea) of the time. Given the history of 20th century Palestine, it's almost as though the Pythons are drawing a parallel between the Judaea of two millennia ago and the Middle East of today. (Sort of: ""Nothing's changed."")

""Life of Brian"" is a great movie. Perhaps the Pythons could have been a bit less controversial and put it in a different setting than the time of Jesus. But so doing would have been less effective in getting across their message, which is the gullibility of people in their desire to become part of the latest movement (or leader) that promises them liberation from their oppressors.",1386806400,,2119,4.573684210526316
3480495,5,B001B2U1AA,"It's not blasphemous--heretical, maybe--but definitely the highest form of low brow humor next to the Holy Grail. I am a man of strong faith and find this movie not the least bit offensive. It's a satirical view of Biblical times and some of the preposterous thinking wrought forth from religious ""authorities"" that even Jesus made fun of. Read the New Testament closely, and you'll find Jesus could sometimes be sarcastic, facetious, and even down right angry at those who professed to know God better than everyone else. The Monty Python group are in the best form with their dry humor and plain silliness.",1386028800,,608,4.912621359223301

3480508,5,B001B2U1AA,"Brian Cohen is a Jew and, born under a wandering star, it seems he is destined to be mistaken, from the manger to the grave, for The Messiah.

LoB is, without any question, the best thing that the Pythons ever did. Their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-sketch/dp/B008H120CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV sketch</a>&nbsp;series has aged badly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-And-The-Holy-Grail/dp/B0001V01BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python And The Holy Grail</a>&nbsp;was an epic Arthurian comedy-drama badly let down by a lame-duck ending, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Meaning-of-Life/dp/B0001WAGHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Meaning of Life</a>&nbsp;was a silver-screen mish-mash of loosely connected sketches of varying quality - some brilliant, some very wide of the mark. Brian, by contrast, is almost flawless; it looks a million dollars (well, 3m), it's laugh out loud funny, it's crammed to the gunwales with classic scenes, lines and comedy set-pieces, and it has a clear and unequivocal message.

Sadly, but hardly surprisingly, that message is still being missed today as some of the interviews in the Making Of documentary demonstrate. LoB is not an attack on Christ, nor even on the central tenets of any particular religion. It is simply poking fun at blind, unquestioning, dogmatic belief. The best example of how life followed art was the way in which the film was vilified and in many cases banned before anyone had actually seen it. One council member is interviewed about his decision to ban the film from cinemas in his district; ""This is precisely the sort of thing we don't want in this town.""* ""Have you seen it?"" ""No."" ""Do you know what's in it?"" ""No."" ""Do you know anything about the organisation who has told you that you should ban it?"" ""No."" Nuff said really.

Back to the film itself; it is not only the pinnacle of Python, but it is one of the best comedies of the 20th Century and is, as a bonus, a sumptuous biblical epic (the film crew had the set of Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth to work with). But a don't take my word for it, make your own mind up. After all, you're all different.

The Immaculate Edition includes a heavenly host of extras, including an insightful documentary and deleted scenes. The best bits are easily missed, however: the radio ads for the show, done by Michael Palin's Dentist, and the mothers of Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese are hilarious.

The production quality is better than the Holy Grail and I give it the nudge over the Grail in terms of pure laughs.

3480547,1,B001B2U1AA,"I realize I'm going to take a few shots for saying this, but here goes. This movie is over-rated IMO. I'm a Python fan dating to the early '70s. I get them. I laugh out loud at them. I think Graham Chapman is one of the half-dozen funniest performers of the 20th century. I'm not keen on one or two members but big deal, they're a troupe. Somehow I missed this film until last night. I hit ""Play"" with delightful anticipation. Well, it seems to me to be amazingly unfunny. I laughed twice. I love what they're attempting - poking fun at things that need to be poked - organized religion, religious zealotry, the Roman Empire, etc. - but their efforts fall flat IMO. The exemplar of this for me is the endless minutes devoted to ""biggus dickus."" I emphasize ""IMO."" Humor is a really  personal thing, needless to say.",1357257600,,815,4.433333333333334

Only a bit less tears-rolling-down-your-cheeks funny than Monty Python and The Holy Grail (to this reviewer), The Life of Brian is a must-see for history buffs or students of religion with a sense of humor, anyone who appreciates a bit of creative lunacy, and aspiring Python fans everywhere.",1356912000,,694,5.123893805309734

I just finally got around to watching the whole movie, and absolutely loved it. I was laughing out loud watching this. There are plenty of reviews on here singing the movie's praises so I'll give you my two criticisms. The first being the spaceship part. I didn't find it funny and it took away from the plot for me. I wanted it to stick to just satirizing ancient Rome. My second complaint is the nudity. I have no problem with nudity when it is adding aesthetic value (think Titanic). But of course, many people won't have a problem with either of these criticisms.
Besides the above, I found all of the comedy extremely tasteful. Of course, it was somehow at the same time childish but in the best way possible. Contrary to how a few other viewers have felt on here, I did not think the movie was trying to be critical or undermine Christianity. I've noticed there is a tendency for many Christians to be completely okay with satirizing other religions like Hinduism, Islam, and Mormon in literature but forbid anyone touches Christianity. It's just so common most people don't really think about how ingrained the satirizing of religions besides Christianity is. This movie is not a personal attack against Christianity. It is a fun movie on, yes religion, but also Roman customs, bureaucracy, and gender roles, If you can see the humor is not malicious or personal, you'll enjoy it.",1356220800,,1500,4.7072243346007605

Religious freaks please spend a few hours to read Bart Erhman, Richard Dawkins, Chris Hitchens and Sam Harris etc. and you may see the reality of things and save much time being offended.

3480566,1,B001B2U1AA,"I'm a big Python fan. Holy Grail is perhaps, for me, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I can watch it continuously and still get laughs. Its clever, witty, amazingly well performed, and (the Python hallmark,) incorrigibly silly. Perhaps the best comedy every made.

So for this troupe to come out with this movie - well, it certainly tempers my regard for them, (especially Cleese, so insistently irreligious.)

I have seen this movie only once, and that was in its theatre release in 1979. Even though I was extremely high at the time, and I laughed uproariously at the ""funny bits,"" the lingering aftertaste is one of distaste and extreme revulsion.

Holy Grail was about a silly look at the iconic King Arthur and the Round Table knights. Plenty of glorious fodder in that, (and the ""God scenes"" are only marginally offensive.)

Life of Brian was their vehicle to attack their mutually disdained adversary, the Christian Religion, (manifested by the ordained Church of England and other church notables.) Surely there is a lot of humor to be found here, but Python goes for more than laughs. What comes across in this picture is not irreverence and silliness, but a very edgy and harsh commentary on religion and its forms.

Brian is a vehicle to mock Christ. The shallow ""mistaken identity"" device is very thin and ill disguised. Yes, we are supposed to understand that Jesus and Brian are two different people, but the satire is directed firmly at the historical record of these events. (You cannot satirize something previously unknown.) Therefore, the attack is directly on the Bible and its accounts.

The Biblical story of Jesus is a very touching and (dare I say,) HOLY. How He is born into this world, the things He says and does, how He is betrayed and ultimately crucified are exceptionally moving and critical events, the likes of which are not even REMOTELY humorous or even slightly funny. In my opinion, only people utterly detuned to the sincerity of Jesus Christ can accept this movie on its terms.

What exactly is funny about pretending the Virgin Mary was a rotten-tooth whore, ready to fellate a Roman soldier at a moment's notice? Even the notion is of such a thing is scandalous! (And that's saying quite a bit in this day and age.) Is this really something funny to consider?

Brian tells the people specifically they are not to follow him, but to be individuals and think for themselves, (responded to by unison replies by the mass of his unthinking, mindless followers.) And yet Jesus Christ says only by following Him can there be any entrance into heaven. So who is mocking Whom? And for what reason? Because Python thinks all believers in Jesus Christ are mindless robots, another thinly veiled attack.

Finally, the crucifixion is treated in an exceptionally foolish and naive manner. There is nothing even remotely funny about people dying on a cross, even in a comedy. That's why you don't see many comedy sketches treading on this ground. Its NOT FUNNY when people are left to die in the most horrific manner imaginable; all the more so when it is the very atonement for the sins of the whole earth that is in view. And to sing, ""Always look on the bright side of life,"" is not funny, its moronic.

BAD movie. Poor performances. Cluttered and incohesive. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. (I won't even watch the clips on YouTube.) Only watchable if you have a taste for blasphemy.",1327449600,,3419,4.769881556683587

3480571,5,B001B2U1AA,"People who call Life of Brian a ""heretical"" or ""blasphemous"" movie must have been the same people who thought the Martians were really invading Earth when Orson Wells' War of the Worlds was broadcasted. They just weren't paying attention. Not to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, let's just say that if you're paying attention you will know that the movie is not about, nor does it mock, Jesus the person, the moral or religious leader, or the Chritian message.

It DOES mock, though, authoritarian mentalities, political and religious, and organized religion. It DOES mock fractured, narrow-minded political oppositions, more interested in protocol than in political action, which was MP's commentary on the ineffectual British left in the late 70's. It DOES mock fanaticism. The movie shows how the quest for personal fulfillment can often lead to absurd results, MP's commentary no doubt to the human potential movement which was thriving at that time. Anybody who can recall an initiate of EST or who knows a Scientologist will know what I mean. And it DOES mock -- in a commentary more relevant to England than in the United States, but which is increasing becoming relevant here -- the effete nature of the Ruling Class. If you tend to be in favor of or gravitate to any of the above, you're probably going to be offended and not like the movie.

What Life of Brian does NOT mock is the Chritian message. The only character in the movie who is presented in a respectful light is the person of Jesus Christ who is seen giving his sermon on the mount.",1323561600,,1568,4.761029411764706

3480574,5,B001B2U1AA,"The movie lampoons religious devotion in a host of ways, such as the apocolyptic preachers, the statement that 'only the true messiah denies his divinity', the following of absurd signs (such as gourds or shoes), etc.

As John Cleese said, they make it clear very early in the movie that 'This is not Christ'. Yet in many ways, many of the depictions are truer to life that many of the so-called life of Jesus movies (I have yet to see a Jesus movie that was well done. My experience is that the bigger the claims they make about it, the worse they are)

That aside, many aspects of the movie invert the reality of the situation: for example, the crucifixions seem to be regarded by the victims as a minor inconvenience, instead of the horrific torture that it really was. And when that administator is processing the victims for their crosses, he makes it sound so urbane and civilized. (Watch Terry Gilliam's body language when Eric Idle says 'No, freedom for me.'

The sound effects when the soldiers enter the old man's house for searching are hilarious - it sounds like someone's shaking a money tin in mock immitation of the clanking of the soldiers' armour.

Though it might not be as immediately gratifying as its peers, I've come to appreciate ""Brian"" as the Pythons' best-written picture over the years, with a razor-sharp wit playing excellently alongside the requisite amounts of lunacy and brow-furrowing topics of conversation. And, though it's clearly a product of the late '70s in many ways, its not-so-subtle warnings against blind faith in any organization (or the men at the helm) is still very relevant in today's world. It isn't the non-stop jaunt through the funhouse that you might expect from this cast, yet ""Brian"" delivers no less efficiently in different ways, especially during its hilariously bleak song and dance finale.",1315526400,,1007,5.109090909090909

With the wait over I can honestly say I was neither surprised or disappointed, nor particularly amused or insulted. It was in fact pretty much what I had expected. Maybe I just don't get British humor, or maybe it's a problem with the heavy British accents. If I hadn't already been familiar with the religious context on which this satire is based I would have found large portions of the film all but unintelligible. Aside from the translation problem I found the truly funny moments in the story to be few and far between.

Memorable Moments:
1-The stoning bit was hilarious,
2-The singing on the cross was a clever touch and
3-All the re-occurring joisting and one-liners between competing Judean liberation groups was amusing and probably the only thing that keep me watching.

There were a few other good moments here and there but not enough to persuade me to endure a second viewing. I guess the comedy of Monty Python is an acquired taste that I apparently lack.",1310947200,,1082,4.689473684210526

3480582,5,B001B2U1AA,"I first saw this movie ages ago, and through the years completely forgot about its existence. Then I watched the Monty Python documentary ""Almost the Truth"" and they talked about this movie and showed clips from it. That brought back the memories and I realized I must have this film for my collection.

I'm not gonna go into great detail about the film itself. If you haven't seen it by now, I can't help you. Buy the damn Blu-Ray (or DVD if you prefer), and see it. It is absolutely amazing and is some of the finest work the Monty Python crew has ever done. I love absolutely every single second of this film, and if you don't, you are probably a bad person. I strongly believe that the people who don't like this movie are the reason we can't have nice things.

On to the Blu-Ray then. I bought this particular edition because of the stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. The picture and sound quality is great. The only complaint (if you want to call it that) that I have is the menu. The writing on the menu can be a little difficult to make out at first glance, but it's not really that big of a deal.

I haven't checked out the commentary or any of the other special features because honestly I don't really care much about all that stuff. I bought the Blu-Ray for the movie, not for all the extra crap. Well worth the cash for the movie alone, all the special features notwithstanding.

I am surprised, however, that so much has been focused on the supposed ""sacrilege"" of the movie, of which there really isn't any if you take a good look at it. The main thrust, however, is at fanaticism in general and the fanaticism that is ruthlessly skewered in the movie is political fanaticism. Judean Liberation Front: why does that sound familiar? Leftists originally watching the movie must have squirmed in their seats when they first saw it because they are realistically portrayed as being pedantic, hair splitting, dogmatic, endlessly feuding with other groups of fanatics who have the same goals as theirs, constantly engaging the verbal diarrhea, posturing at being holier than thou.

There was one aspect of the movie that I did not like, but others will, and it is one of the trademarks of the Monty Python crew and that was that the same actors were in multiple roles throughout the movie.

It's very incongruous that Monty Python can make so many brilliantly funny skits, but could put together such complete rubbish into a full-length movie. This DVD went into the trash after I saw it once-definitely one of the two or three worst movies I've ever seen. It's utterly beyond me how anyone could be entertained by the idea of innocent people being crucified, to say nothing of the numerous other completely failed attempts at humor that fill this movie.

Be advised that, if you're of the Christian faith, you will find this movie very offensive.

On one level, the movie is a comedy, bordering on slap-stick. It is a smashing success on that surface level.

The multiple commentary tracks and bonus features were great, and the picture was definitely an upgrade from my VHS copy. Several years later, I was disappointed to see that Criterion didn't assume the task of releasing Life of Brian on Blu-ray, leaving it to Sony instead. Well, having finally jumped on the Blu-ray bandwagon, I decided to pick up the new disc. All I can say is wow. This completely blows the Criterion DVD out of the water. This is a crystal clear, spotless transfer whereas the Criterion version had plenty of scratches, specks, and whatnot on the film. I had no idea this movie could look this good. Most of the bonus features have been carried over, and there is a new retrospective featurette with interviews of all the living Pythons, so parting ways with my old DVD was a piece of cake.

3480597,5,B001B2U1AA,"Three wise men wend their way to a small hut in a small town, 2000 years ago. They are in search of the Messiah and they come bearing gifts...but first they make a small mistake and deliver them to He who is not the Savior, Brian, who happens to be born on the same day, just down the alley from that Jesus fella.  Brian grows up a fairly oblivious and apolitical mama's boy, though sadly with less interest in stonings than is proper.  Alas, events lead him to work with the People's Front of Judea, the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife, accidental prophet-hood, and eventual crucifixion to the tune of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""

The conventional wisdom on LIFE OF BRIAN is that it's the Python crew's most ""polished"" or ""competent"" film as a team, and I'd probably agree with that, though I find HOLY GRAIL funnier.  It's still scattershot and somewhat inconsistent of course - I for one found the whole Pilate/Biggus Dickus thing a bit overlong, and the alien abduction while fun doesn't really add anything besides giving Terry Gilliam more to do - but it does actually feel like a moderately cohesive film, and of course it takes the typical Python over-the-top methods on attacking organized religion to a point which all but the most humor-challenged Christians ought to be able to admit to at least chuckling over - it's a bit more pointed and narrow in its humor.  Of course, the film isn't really anti-Christian, or anti-Jewish, but rather anti-stupid. Maybe that was its biggest problem with some audiences....

Early highlights include the stoning scene and the scene with the ex-leper, but where the film really takes off in my mind is when Brian becomes an accidental prophet.  It seems to be channeling or ripping off HOLY GRAIL at first - smart, articulate Brian being completely misunderstood by the idiot peasants, just exactly as Bedevere in the earlier film presiding over the witch's trial - but the brilliance with which Brian quickly goes from being just another hairy crazed prophet (reminiscent naturally of street-corner shouters even today) to being followed all around by a witless mob is startling and hard for me to describe.  I think this may be the apex of the Pythons' wordplay, and the fact that it's foreshadowed in an early scene where Brian and others are listening to the real Messiah but misinterpreting his words wildly only adds an icing to the cake. If there's a message to LIFE OF BRIAN it's that people will hear what they want to hear, and sometimes no matter how clear you think you're being, you're not going to get through to them - especially if God's in the way.

I find comedy harder to describe or critique than just about anything else; perhaps that's a copout but I'm not sure how I can really get at just how clever and funny the film is without quoting a bunch of dialogue, and what's the point in that? You're here on IMDb, you can check it out easily yourselves.  I will close by saying that in one way LIFE OF BRIAN does seem to ""conform"" to the more modern style of religious ""epic"" - the Jerusalem and the Jews here are dirty, disheveled, and poor. Gone pretty much for good by this time is the splendor of the 50s and 60s Cinemascope epics - although I suspect that may have as much do with the small budgets of the Pythons' film, and Scorsese's and Gibson's later, serious efforts at the Christ story, as with any conscious desire to make things grubby.

Note on the disc - the transfer is excellent, and you can't beat this (or most editions of Python films, really) for extras; I've only scratched the surface of the two commentaries, the documentary, etc, and haven't even touched the cast reading.",1258243200,,3681,4.647692307692307
3480598,5,B001B2U1AA,"There are certain movies that stand out on the holidays.  This is not one of them.  It probably should be.  You will find that many of the Python crew plays many different characters in the movie.

Now the truth can be told.  It all starts with three wise men delivering gifts to young Brian.  Oops they correct their mistake.  Later, Judea, 33 A.D., on a Saturday afternoon, once again Brian (Graham Chapman) is a tad far down the mount when they hear what sounds as ""blessed are the cheese makers"" (it's not meant to be taken literally that could mean any manufacturer).  That is where Brian first sees Judith (Sue Jones.)  Later he shall be involved in the People's Front of Judea.  Later still he will be mistaken for the messiah (it is a logical mistake).  Two factions fight over who owns the messiah (the Shoe Followers and Gourd Followers.)

You will recognize many of your favorite vices and verses.  One of the highlights of the story is the speech given by Pilate and Biggus Dickus.

3480599,5,B001B2U1AA,"We fans can rave endlessly about the geniuses behind ""Life of Brian"", but (like most good humor) it is pointless to try to define where that genius lies.  Think of the scene with Pontius Pilate: it was probably funny on paper and even in rehearsal, but it will live as a great comic scene because of Michael Palin's superb delivery.  Not just his lisp, but his facial expressions as he tries new phrases and watches for the audience reaction.  Is this expert direction?  Is it intuitively Palin's doing, because of his experience in sketch humor? Did it evolve, like Topsy, from the critical mass of comedy talent involved?

Another thing that puzzles me as I watched the documentary about the shows, the people, and the movies: I can remember seeing the shows for the first time and feeling threatened by the humor.  Were they attacking me? And values I held? I couldn't relax and go along with the joke until about the third time through, when my kids were roaring at the zaniness.  So: did I change or did my sense of humor adapt to something I knew was acceptedly funny despite being profane and bawdy and just plain silly?

3480606,5,B001B2U1AA,"""Life of Brian"" is probably the greatest comedy ever made. (With the Python-related serial ""Fawlty Towers"" a good second.) It makes excellent fun out of religious and political fanaticism, not to mention sheer stupidity. The negative reactions to the movie from certain quarters somehow prove its point!

Inevitably, most people react and comment on the portrayal of Jesus and his involuntary doppelgnger, Brian. Personally, I always thought other parts of the movie were more humorous. For instance, it criticizes the small and constantly squabbling ""Marxist"" groups that still existed in Britain and elsewhere during this time. That the Judean People's Front (or was it the People's Front of Judea?) turns out to be more interested in talking about revolution rather than in actually making one, is also right on target. Note also that the ""Judean"" groups lampoon the name of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine!

But perhaps I like that part of the show because I happen to know a few things about the ""far left"" in Western Europe?

But what about Jesus, then? Apparently, the Pythons had some disagreements among themselves on whether or not ""The Life of Brian"" is a deliberate attack on Jesus and Christianity. Regardless of what the ""real"" point of this movie might be, it's interesting to note that they couldn't attack Jesus directly. I don't think that's a co-incidence. You can insult or make fun of those who believe in the message of Christianity, but how do you wax ironic over the character of Jesus himself? Say, the Jesus of the Gospel of John? I don't see how *that's* possible. What makes ""Life of Brian"" so entertaining is precisely the contrast between the real Jesus and the perennial looser Brian. The same is true of the fact that the thick-headed people of Judea constantly confuse the real Son of God with his obviously incompetent double. That people follow the wrong leader, or misunderstand the words of great prophets and philosophers, is hardly news. Ironically, it's almost a Biblical theme. In fact, if you absolutely want to criticize this movie for something, it would have to be its unkind portrayal of the common people. Taken at face value, ""Life of Brian"" says that Jesus was a sublime teacher, while you and me are stupid for following the *other* guy!

Never thought of that before, have you? :D

Whatever else Monty Python might have wanted to say with ""Life of Brian"", they certainly made a classical parody of fanaticism, factionalism, abstract intellectuals, crazy terrorists, and thick-headed people in general.

3480612,5,B001B2U1AA,"If you've ever tried to compile a list of pure comedies that are also truly great examples of cinema, you'll know how hard it is. I get stuck at about three.

There are outstandingly brilliant funny films, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B000B5XOWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap/dp/6305922756/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap</a>, that never transcend the string of loosely-themed set pieces that was their genesis and, whilst compulsory viewing, don't pretend to operate as real motion pictures (in fairness some of Christopher Guest's later output, and in particular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Wind/dp/B0000ALFVD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Wind</a>, does). There are wonderful films that happen to be funny, and maybe even wonderful comedies that aren't all that funny.

But Monty Python's Life of Brian, while it pulls you in with its homely premise and, true to Python form, plays out very much like a string of set pieces, effortlessly transcends its genre into timelessness and profundity. That it's still as challenging today as it was on release (for different, but not that different, reasons) is part of it, but that doesn't speak to the pure cinema of it. The closing scene, as classic a sketch as any Monty Python devised, isn't just a magical set piece, but is a bittersweet and timeless commentary on the absurdity of life and, to boot, a genuinely moving swansong for Monty Python itself (leaving aside the somewhat challenging existence, for this theory, of 1983's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Meaning-of-Life/dp/B000A2UBNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Meaning of Life</a>). There are some transcendent moments in the history of cinema, and the cheerily whistling, toe-tapping routine of condemned men on crosses, pulling out to a twilight wide shot, is as superb as any of them.

The sketches are of course brilliantly funny and all eminently, inevitably and annoyingly quotable by males of a certain age, but the underlying absurdities they point up, dearly held sacred cows all - the absurdity of stoning someone for saying Jehovah, the absurdity of political protesting for the principle of it, the wilful absurdity of ""miraculous"" explanations for innocent behaviour (says the hermit who has just accidentally broken a vow of silence,  Brian having trod on his foot: ""I hadn't said a word in eighteen years until he came along"". The crowd: ""a miracle!""), and the sum total of all of this mayhem: the absurdity of life itself - are decisively executed and keenly observed. This is by no means wacky private schoolboy humour of no consequence: this is cutting social satire, and it is to all of our discredit that, nearly thirty years on, the motivated prurience of religious groups has barely abated.

In the accompanying disk there is a terrific documentary charting the reception of this film on general release in 1979, which to us old dogs really doesn't seem that long ago, but on the strength of that documentary may as well have between before the Boer War.

Well, in one sense. But when Terry Gilliam wonders out loud whether that film could get made today, and doubts it, you have to suspect he's right: the absurd objections of the  Mary Whitehouse brigade might not pass muster these days, but equally pernicious (and absurd) ones from other religions have taken their place. When we tolerate religion but don't tolerate free speech you do have to wonder. In any case, it is interesting to see footage in that documentary of the Pythons' famous BBC2 debate with Malcolm Muggeridge and the Bishop of Southwark, if for no other reason because it's rare chance to see the permanently-genial Michael Palin so worked up as to seem visibly to be restraining himself from lamping Malcolm Muggeridge.

This ""immaculate"" pressing of the film didn't seem to be up to much for me - I was disappointed in the surround sound quality on the feature disk (I once owned a long player of the soundtrack, and remember the musical numbers being far crisper) and the bonus disc has little on it apart from the hour long making-of documentary, interesting though that was.

Lastly, kudos to the late George Harrison, who apparently single-handedly financed the film when no-one else would (and, presumably, made a killing!) without whom we may still be living under the dark auspices of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association.

OK, not that likely, but still.

3480613,3,B001B2U1AA,"This one-disc version of Python's historical (note I did not say historically accurate)comedy set at the time of Jesus is rare among comedies in that it's still able to retain most of its humour value over the years and hence ages quite well.  Although not all the scenes remain funny, there were some that left me in stitches such as the ""Biggus Dickus"" scenes with Pontius Pilate while the UFO scene was just stupid and actually in my opinion took away from the comedic value of the film a great deal.  Like ""Ben Hur"" this film is set at the time of the birth of Christianity but other than that the story has really very little to do with Christ or Christianity in general other than as a minor sub-plot.

The story here is about a group of sinners who try to scrape a living by surviving the brutality of the Romans and particularly one of them, Brian, who is mistaken for a prophet and for a while the Messiah.  Historians will tell you that in real life, many people at the time of Jesus were mistaken for the Messiah and even John the Baptist was as well and so there's nothing unusual here.  They will also tell you that crucificion was the norm and not the exception as a form of punishment in those days and so I chose to take this comedy at face value and I never felt insulted in any way as a Christian myself.  In any case, if your faith is founded on strong foundations, comedies like these shouldn't faze you.  In fact, I thought the film was rather respectful of Christ himself and that the only buffoons were the cast who misunderstood his teachings and if you recall even in real life he faced a lot of sinners who misunderstood him and so again, nothing out of the ordinary here.  If any historical figure was made to look like a jackass here it would have to be Pontius Pilate and some of the Roman soldiers and I'm sure not many people would have complaints about that.

It's a good value, saving you $9 over the cost of purchasing both separately. And the packaging for the Holy Grail discs is especially nice (it includes the script of the movie in paperback format, and a few other goodies).

3480628,4,B001B2U1AA,"Monty Python's most coherent film ""Life of Brian"" tells the story of Brian who just happens to be born next door to Christ. The parallel follows him his whole life as he is mistaken for the Messiah throughout his life. A very funny parody of the hypocrisy that often exists within religion, politics with a great interlude that pokes fun at ""Star Wars"", ""Life of Brian"" faced a lot of controversey before it was even released. The Pythons lost their funding from EMI and they faced the Coalition of Light a Christian group in the UK that attacked the film.

Ironically, the Pythons DON'T lampoon JC as when they went back to the Bible to prepare the screenplay they realized he had terrific things to say. It was the follow thorugh that kind of sucked. Luckily, George Harrison stepped in and took out a second on several of his mansions to get the film made.

The Blu-Ray looks extremely good. Does it look as great as a contemporary film? No but the film was shot on a low budget (around $4 million)but looks more expensive because the Pythons took advantage of the standing sets for other biblical epics. Although Terry Jones' direction is more pedestrian looking than Terry Gilliam (who does art direction, animation and appears in multiple roles here)he handles the characters and comedy extremely well.

We get a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film with current interviews from the surviving Pythons (Graham Chapman who played Brian died of cancer over a decade ago), the current leader of th Coalition of Lights, critics and those associated with the production. It's a terrific documentary looking at the film's reception and even has clips from Tom Snyder's show where they appeared defending their work and a UK show where they did a showdown with a pair of religious leaders who attacked the film.

There will always be those who don't ""get"" the film either because it's not to their taste or because they have religious objections (although I've found that usually those that do object for the second reason haven't seen the film or miss the fact that it is a satire of the politics and distortion of religious beliefs and not because it satires Christ--it doesn't--although it does satirize how we can often distort what we hear..as in the line ""blessed are the cheesemakers"" heard by one person because they are standing too far away from Christ when he gives his sermon on the mount to hear him and being razzed). If that's the case, this film truly wasn't made for them.

We also get deleted scenes, an audio read through of the script and other goodies including commentary tracks.",1211673600,,2610,4.752759381898454
3480629,4,B001B2U1AA,"Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" lampoons romanticized interpretations of the Gospels by bringing us the tragicomic story of Brian (Graham Chapman), a man born in the same time and place as Jesus Christ, who lived and died under similar circumstances, though a touch more ironic and a lot funnier. When the wise men come from the East, bearing gifts for their infant Savior, they mistakenly enter the wrong stable, where they are berated by Brian's mother (Terry Jones), before they realize their error. Thus begins the life of Brian, who eventually joins the revolutionary People's Front of Judea to resist Roman rule and accidentally acquires a following who believe he is the Messiah.

Though clearly inspired by stories about the life of Jesus, ""Life of Brian"" is not making fun of Jesus or the words or actions attributed to him. Jesus is only present in one scene in this film and referred to in one other. ""Life of Brian"" pokes fun at those who look to others to determine their values and follow their leaders blindly. The ineffectual People's Front of Judea, with its idle leader Reg (John Cleese) and feminist activist Judith (Sue Jones-Davies), satirizes the leftist revolutionary groups of the 1960s and 1970s. The Romans are mocked as sybarites and bureaucrats, the Jews as primitives, and they are all viewed as barbaric.

Though its chief purpose is to amuse, ""Life of Brian"" is an equal opportunity offender that offhandedly focuses the audience's attention on what the authors consider the important part of the Christian message by persistently knocking everything else off its pedestal. Maybe this film is serious after all. I don't expect orthodox Christians will like it, because it doesn't treat the Gospels reverentially or take them literally. But liberal Christians may appreciate the laughs and even the lesson. I found Brian, himself, too whiney to be likable, but, otherwise, ""Life of Brian"" is a clever parody of human ideologies and idiocies, ancient and modern.",1209945600,,1990,5.064024390243903

3480634,5,B001B2U1AA,"For those of you who don't dig, or simply haven't been exposed to, the Monty Python crew's brand of offbeat british humor, ""The Life of Brian"" may just win you over.  This is by far this ensemble's greatest film, easily surpassing ""The Holy Grail"" in terms of comedic punch and social relevance.

This Blu-ray edition is, hands down, the best presentation of this film to date.  Sony continues it's great track record of releasing pristine transfers of catalog titles.  With the exception of some noisy video in a few dark scenes, particularly the scene where Brian is confronted by a centurion versed in the intricacies of Latin grammar, this film looks flawless.  It's always amazing to me how much detail can be squeezed out of standard def quality film, especially in Brian's case since the movie is nearly 20 years old.  Color reproduction is great, black levels and contrast are deep and stable respectively, and fine detail is unbelievable.  In short, this Blu-ray disc is perfect, and for only 20 bucks at Amazon, you really can't beat the price.

This disc comes packed with special features including; two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, a ""behind the scenes"" type look at Brian, and a host of subtitle options (22 in total if you can believe it).  For fans of the film, this is simply a must-have.

""The Life of Brian"" was controversial upon its release because it allegedly mocked Christian doctrine.  As a result it has never quite enjoyed the mainstream success of other Python flicks.  For me this is by far the Python's most solid film, entertaining and thought provoking, Brian accomplishes everything a great film should.  Only Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"" comes close to matching it in terms of tackling difficult issues, but where ""Dogma"" falls short of greatness due to Smith's sometimes heavy-handed dialogue, Brian truly shines.  If you haven't seen it yet for whatever reason, but particularly if you feel that it may insult your faith, please check it out.  This movie isn't in any way an indictment of Christianity, but instead a thoughtful and hilarious examination of dogma and the zealots who are so quick to cast judgment on their fellow man.  Simply put, this film is perfect, and this is the definitive version of an already superb film.",1208304000,,2265,4.905511811023622

3480639,5,B001B2U1AA,"Nothing is sacred to the Monty Python gang. Proving this point is the hilariously irreverent Life of Brian, about a hapless Judean born on Christmas in the stall next to Jesus. He joins the People's Front of Judea, who hate the Romans (but not quite as much as they hate the splitters in the Judean People's Front!), and tries to fend off the multitudes who insist he's the messiah.

Life of Brian is an extremely funny and quotable satire. It's not so much a parody of Christianity or the Jesus story, though, as a satire poking fun at the universally human tendency to join religious or social movements and miss the point entirely. It's funny precisely because it's so true. In one scene, as Brian flees his zealous followers, he leaves behind a shoe, which becomes the center of a heated argument over whether to revere the shoe or the gourd Brian got rid of earlier. Later in the movie, Brian addresses the multitudes:

Brian: Please, please, please listen! I've got one or two things to say.
The Crowd: Tell us! Tell us both of them!
Brian: Look, you've got it all wrong! You don't NEED to follow ME, You don't NEED to follow ANYBODY! You've got to think for your selves! You're ALL individuals!
The Crowd: Yes! We're all individuals!
Brian: You're all different!
The Crowd: Yes, we ARE all different!

The People's Front of Judea couldn't be a more appropriate parody of the sillier aspects of radical movements, including the factions of the modern-day Middle East. The time they spend squabbling amongst themselves and drafting resolutions, rather than fighting the external foe, quite comically hits the nail on the head.

3480641,5,B001B2U1AA,"This review is for the Blu-ray release of the movie only. For a critical review of the movie itself, there are many others available (although, for the record, I think this is a funny and a recommended film).
Like the other Monty Python movies, I first saw this film when it was released to theaters in the USA many years ago. My memory of it was that the colors were not particularly lush and that the film had that 1970's more-grain-than-it-needs-to-have look. I have not seen the film since, so either my memory is wrong or someone has done something very right with this high definition transfer -- Visually, this is an excellent transfer and release to Blu-ray disc. Do not expect it to be as sharp and detailed as the high def restoration of the large negative Vista-Vision originated film ""The Searchers"", nor is it as fine grain and colorful as a recent film like the Blu-ray disc release of ""Hairspray"", but, for this type of film, this is something close to perfection. The source material must have been in good shape (and the transfer contains no dirt or print marks!). More color than any Python film in my memory. The film is sharp and yet there is no ""objectionable film grain"" (and this is rare, as often when they transfer an old film-to-HD or Video, they use so much ""grain reduction"" and ""dirt fixing"" technology that they turn the image into a soft mush -- That is not the case here.) I could not have predicted a better job.
My only complaint is with the sound mix. While as clear and clean as one might expect, this slight re-mix for 5.1 digital surround has done what so many new movies do today: If you set the level right for the music, the dialogue will be so low as to need subtitles. If you set it right for the dialogue, you will have to cover your ears because the music will blast you out of the room. This seems to be a common arrogance on the part of sound mixers today -- Because we have such dynamic range in audio recording & reproduction today, the sound mixers use it to an extreme that no one concerned with the aesthetics of good sound mixing could or should accept. Fortunately, there are only about 3 or 4 places in the movie that this is a problem (Warning: One is at the start of the movie), and the excessively loud music is over points in the movie that are not inter-mixed with dialogue (so, while it is wrong and one should not have to do such, just keep the sound remote control handy).",1204156800,,2435,4.401330376940133

3480647,5,B001B2U1AA,"This is the 4th iteration of this movie that I have owned.  My first was on VHS, then came the Criterion LaserDisc, which was followed by the Criterion DVD edition.  I really wasn't expecting much of an improvement over the Criterion DVD since this is an older movie.  Regardless of what version you own, if you are a Python fan, you are in for a HUGE surprise with this latest edition on Blu-ray.  The picture is near perfection with only a couple of scenes where I noticed the tiniest bit of film grain.  Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was the remastered sound elements.  After trying the different sound choices, I found the PCM soundtrack to be the best.  I really wasn't expecting the sound to be that great for this movie, but BOY was I surprised.  Sony has truly outdone themselves with this latest high def remastering of Life of Brian.  This is the absolute best I have ever seen or heard of this zany film.  There are details in the picture that I have NEVER seend before, and I have seen this movie MANY MANY times.  If I had to complain about anything, it would be that the special features were not in HD, but that is not that big a deal since everything else about this title is just spot on.

There are many who would say this movie is a sacrilege.  As a Christian, I would disagree with such a statement.  I have heard some say that this movie is making light of Jesus' ministry, and especially his crucifixion.  They are missing the whole point.  I think this movie illustrates how some people will blindly follow religious leaders, or will just go with the crowd without really questioning what they're doing, or why they're doing it.  The scene where Brian is mistaken for Jesus and chased by the crowd is a good example.  When his sandal falls off, some take it as a sign that they should remove their own sandal, while some choose to follow the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem.  How can anyone NOT see the humor in that???  Also, what if there really were some in the far back of the crowd at the Sermon on the Mount who couldn't quite make out what was being said???  I have seen this movie countless times, and at no point is Jesus ever actually made fun of.  Even the crucifixion scene is obviously not a slight on Jesus' own crucifixion.  He is not the only person to ever be crucified, since there were countless others who suffered this horrible form of death.  The crucifixion scene obviously is not about Jesus' crucifixion since there are much more than three men being crucified.  Of course, I'm sure there are those who would disagree with me.  If you do find this movie to be offensive, then simply don't watch it.  After all, this is still a free country.  To those of you who have longed for a pristine version of this classic Python piece, you MUST get this one on Blu-ray.  I will be waiting patiently for Sony to deliver a comparable version of the Holy Grail on Blu-ray soon.",1201737600,,2911,4.429378531073446
3480648,5,B001B2U1AA,"I suspect most fans of this film and Monty Python in general already own a copy on DVD. The bonus features in this new double-disc edition definitely make it worth the repeat buy. Most of the features from the Criterion edition (two commentary tracks, five deleted scenes, radio ads) are here. (The nice 1979 BBC documentary ""The Pythons"" is the only feature from the Criterion version missing from this new set.)

The new hour-long documentary included with this edition is worth the purchase alone. All five surviving Pythons are interviewed and offer a lot of insight into the film, from its conception, to the controversy surrounding its opening (in the US and in the UK), to its lasting standing as the Pythons' greatest work. (Yes, I know, many fans like ""Grail"" even more.) I'm always pleased to see up-to-date interviews with the team, now all in their sixties.

The other significant feature is an audio reading of the original script, recorded with all six members several months before filming began. This is much more enjoyable and watchable than you might expect, illustrated onscreen with storyboard drawings and script pages. The reading is 20 minutes longer than the film, and you hear some bits that never made it past this stage.

3480653,5,B001B2U1AA,"This is Python's most unique film, in that it was enormously controversial when it was released, something most people don't know about.  It was originally to be funded by EMI, but then some pressure groups got to EMI, so they cancelled it.  Luckily, George Harrison's Handmade Films came in and rescued the production.  When it hit here, Catholic groups were up in arms over the film, and they even tried to prosecute on the grounds of ""blasphemy"".  Even the right wing icon William F. Buckley, Jr. (who, despite being a right winger, actually is very articulate and has a small sense of art) got into the fray, wrote an article in the New York Post condemning the film and saying that Monty Python was crucified in the final scene.  Monty Python is not a real person as most people know.  It's more than likely the wanker Buckley didn't see the film.  The BBFC, the censor board in the U.K., was under pressure from religious groups and gave it a 18 rating, limiting its audience to adults.

As for the film itself, it's hilarious, and it lampoons the rather idiotic notions of religion and politics.  There's even a scene where they lampoon the PC left (the term PC hadn't been invented yet) where Idle constantly interrupts his group by insisting that the word woman be added to every sentence that Cleese puts out.  But it's mostly fundie religious types that get lampooned here, along with most sections of humanity.  There are many hilarious scenes, like the stoning scene, the ""blessed are the cheesemakers"" sermon on the mount scene, and, of course, the final scene where the crucified people are all singing ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"".

These former splinter-group ""revolutionaries"" are now in major mainstream organizations where they weald enormous influence.

3480674,5,B001B2U1AA,"Monty Python's Life of Brian is a comedy masterpiece. It is second only to their first production, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", but even then it is great. There are two or three scenes that are hysterically funny, the ""Stoning scene"" and the ""Biggus Dickus"" scene with the centurions. I would buy this film for those reasons right there.

But another thing that struck a cord with me, was the scene where Brian falls off the building and the space ship miraculously saves him by picking him up and taking him for a ride. This scene was so random it was funny. Another scene, where Brian and, I believe, Judith are shown nude. It was pretty much full frontal. I didn't expect this especially when considering Holy Grail was PG, but that's exactly why it was funny. Because it was nasty. There's just something funny about 1970s British folks running around in Judea bare naked that makes me laugh.

The opening scene with the Wise Men and the baby is also pretty funny. They always, in at least one instance, have one of Python's play a woman. And her voice is also very high. Other highlights include, the man in the jail, Pontius Pilate's speech impediment (lol), ""we've got to haggle"", the Stan ""I Want to Be a Woman"" scene, the gladiatorial games,  and ""Look on the Bright Side of Life"" (heck, the entire movie is gold), which is kinda ludicrous when you realize that the guy is about to get crucified.

3480680,5,B001B2U1AA,"John Cleese once said that this film is what he'd most like to be remembered for, which coming from a man who wrote some of the best Python sketches and Fawlty Towers, should tell you something about how good this film is.

Hugely controversial at the time, the subject matter of 'The Life of Brian' was considered strictly taboo in 1979, and even today it can still rattle a few cages, but ultimately the Python team all shared the same conviction that they were not poking fun at religion (or Jesus) per se, but at the people who blindly follow and misunderstand. In this way, 'The Life Of Brian' became not just a comedy classic, but a ground-breaking movie that pushed the barriers of what was previously considered 'off-limits'.

Graham Chapman revels in the lead role of 'Brian of Nazareth', and the rest of the team play multiple rolls, in a very Goon Show-esque type way, with the story always revolving around Brian. The turning point comes when, in an attempt to evade the notice of the Romans, Brian pretends to be a street preacher and gathers the attention of a small crowd. Once the Romans pass by, however, he stops preaching and tries to walk away, only to find that the small crowd want to hear the rest of what he was saying. As more and more people come along to find out what is happening, his followers multiply until they are convinced that he must be some sort of messiah. They follow Brian home only to be told by his mother that ""There's a mess alright, but no messiah.."" (I'm paraphrasing, by the way!)

Each member of the Python team contributes immensely to the film, with Eric Idle supplying a classic Python tune as Brian is being crucified (""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life""), Terry Gilliam with some great visual gags, Terry Jones as the director of the film, Cleese and Palin turning in multiple brilliant performances (like Cleese's Reg, the leader of the PFJ, and the classic ""What have the Roman's ever done for us?"" sketch), not to mention Chapman as the unsuspecting hero. There are also a couple of cameo appearances (notably Spike Milligan and George Harrison) which can be spotted by the eagle-eyed viewer, but are all too brief if you ask me.

If you haven't got this film in your collection, then now is your chance to correct the error of your ways!... and as the ""Not the Nine O'Clock News"" team once pointed out, Britain is still ostensibly a Python-worshipping country, so do your duty and buy a copy of this classic today!",1150675200,,2477,4.597285067873303

3480687,5,B001B2U1AA,"On the same day that Jesus Christ was born, another miracle took place, just next door! The birth of Brian. However, the wise men didn't quite think that he was as extraordinary as his neighbor. From here on in begins THE LIFE OF BRIAN, the third film from the genius' of MONTY PYTHON. I think this movie is just as good as Holy Grail, with countless hillarious gags throughout. ""Why do you want to be a woman Stan?""
If you have never seen a Monty Python movie before, you may be wise to see HOLY GRAIL first, it IS the all time classic. This movie follows more of a straight plot (although straight is probably not the best word) than the other PYTHON movies. Brian is the central character, and he decides to join The PFJ, (The Peolpes Front of Judia) in order to rebel against the Romans. During a raid Brian is almost captured by the Romans but escapes only to become involved with a horde of people who think that he is the Messiah. This of course leads to his getting crucified and eventually a wonderful song sang by Eric Idle and a bunch of crucifees called ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE. A ton of stuff happens along the way, and the Python cast as always plays dozens of zany characters. You will surely have a good time watching this one. ""I don't care... and I want to make this ABSOLUTELY clear.... even if they do say JEHOVAH!""

Oh yeah, just so you can't say I didn't warn you, there is a show all naked scene.  I know I'm usually into that sort of thing but it really isn't that cool here.",1134000000,,1514,4.2717770034843205

3480689,5,B001B2U1AA,"Watching this movie for the first time was a strange experience for me: I was laughing myself silly, with tears of joy running down my cheeks, but then suddenly came a moment that changed it all, a somewhat sad and emotional bit for me. It was the scene when Brian is caught by a Roman centurion while doing an anti-Roman graffiti, and given a Latin grammar lesson, complete with that cruelest entry in the every teacher's bag of tricks, ""write this sentence a hundred times before dawn."" The moment when yawning Brian finishes his job and sets himself up to be the Number One Public Enemy of the Evil Empire, I suddenly knew that the good people that made this movie understood how it feels to get up at dawn and drag your weary self to a 7 am Latin class, and run down a dozen declinations of ""Rosa, rosae, rosae..."" before you even begin to wake up. My heart went out to the Pythons and all I could think of was ""Revenge is sweet! Take that, Caesar, you hack writer!""
However, in a very likely case that you have no emotional issues with and don't really give a toss about Latin grammar, then all you get is only a most brilliant movie: a ruthless expos of the machinery of Roman and British empires at their biggest and baddest stages, a merciless spoof of Bible epics, one biting satire about organized religion and political parties subdividing themselves into absurdity, and possibly the funniest movie ever made.
Watch this movie with your friends and if they don't laugh with you, change your friends; it's a litmus test for bigotry. If they think that the discussion about the line ""And blessed are the cheesemakers..."" is not funny, or worse, if they find it offensive, it's time to upgrade.
And if you know and love this movie something awful, and play ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" when life gets you down, then you have no excuse not to get this edition of our beloved classic, because you get Brian and a host of fabulous extras in one great DVD package.
For starters, try the Radio Ads, featuring heart-wrenching pleas from Michael Pallin's dentist, and mothers of Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese. Then check out the hillarious theatrical trailer, the deleted scenes (the Shephards one is a hoot), run the whole epic with several available enlightening commentaries (where you get to hear John Cleese's story of his struggles with Latin cases) or see the wonderful and bizarre documentary about making of Life of Brian and joys of shooting on location and good hearted trashing of your co-Pythons. And whatever you do, don't click on the menu item called Color Bars! You've been warned...",1131062400,,2624,4.657327586206897
3480690,5,B001B2U1AA,"I'll be honest, I didn't see how ""the boys"" could get any funnier than ""...Search for the Holy Grail"", but THEY HAVE.

Graham Chapman reaches amazing comedic heights as ""Brian"" the mistaken Messiah. The entire fim has a coherent plot (with one 2-minute exception that seems prophetic of some Gilliam films) and completely harpoons every Biblical epic in a way that filmakers today wouldn't dream of trying - but in very good taste.

Except for the full frontal nudity of both sexes.

The other Pythons are also brillant in their own right, swapping out character after character in their classic style. Shockingly, Terry Gilliam is actually present on the screen for a pretty substansial amount of time, showing off his own performing talent long hidden behind the animator's desk. Coincidentally, the film has only one animated scene - the credits.

However, for all fellow Christians out there, compared with many ""South Park"" episodes, the entire religous aspect of Christ and such is given much respect. The first opening scene is one of Jesus preaching to the masses in honest, respective biblical text and chaos ensues from a few ""Pythonites"" in the back who can't hear what He's saying. Also, Brian never tries to ""be"" the Messiah, rather he spends half the movie trying to convince an idiotic, over-zealous horde to leave him the ""bloody hell alone"".

I suppose this film received a bad rap in the seventies and eighties, but it's really all right for adults - just close your eyes when you see a bare-bottomed Graham Chapman heading for a window (if you don't like that sort of thing...) and beware because there is a good bit of cursing througout. So see it once and ""decide for youselves"" and if you like it, great. If you don't, at least you can argue intelligently with those of us who do. Also, the closing scene of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" is worth sitting through the whole movie for.

Finally, as a reference point to all the other Python films,

Magnanimously more storylined than ""And Now For Something...""

Even more historical references than ""...The Holy Grail...""

Nowhere near as disgusting as Mr. Creosote from ""...The Meaning of Life.""

P.S. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is NOT bullocks and this film is NOWHERE near replacement for it...though you'd probably have a more...entertaining evening watching ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"".

No-one should take any offense in the film and call it sacreligious as it is so funny and zany, it goes beyond the level at which you can take offense! I mean, come on. There is one scene in whcih the title role, Brian (played very well by Graham Chapman)is inadvertantly abducted by aliens and taken for a ride around the cloar system.

3480693,5,B001B2U1AA,"I highly recommend this move. I don't think it is anti Christian. I believe that this is the Monty Python groups best work. They are so educated - in the best tradition of English universities, they know their classical history, Greek Roman to the transition to Judeo Christian.

In the Python Movie, Jesus Christ has only a brief appearance and he is presented as a noble, great spiritual speaker of truth. But, he is trying to speak simple, spiritual truths to well, regular people who are mostly morons, idiots, people like the people we know in our age.

I love the scene where Jesus is preaching his sermon on the mount and saying to the crowds:

""blessed are the meek""

Some regular idiots in the cheap seats at the back say:

""Did he say blessed are the GREEKS? Why should the Greeks be blesses"" and the arguing and bickering starts, Christ message is screwed up and politicized from the start.

This movie also has a very, very interesting take on the conflict between Roman rule, the Pax Roman (Roman peace) and Jewish political ambitions with the Judeo Christian split happening.  Jews were upset that they were defeated and occupied by the Romans, non Jewish Gentiles who were arrogant in believing that the Roman way was better than other ways, including Jewish ways. The Jews were plotting secret terrorist rebellions against the Romans with the Jewish religious myth that a Jewish Messiah would appear to restore the glory of Jewish rule in Jerusalem. Christ comes as a prince of peace and this isn't the Messiah that many of the Jewish political leaders, high priests want.

There is a great scene where John Cleese is shouting at his Jewish terrorists to incite them to fight the Romans.

""What have the Romans ever done for us? Name one good thing Roman rule has brought us?""

A small voice in the back says:

""The aqueducts""

Then other voices start adding

""Roman roads, rule of law, modern medicine, schools etc"".

Cleese clearly frustrated says ""Yeah, well outside the aqueducts, the roads, rule of law, schools, modern medicine, civilization, what have the Romans ever done for us""?

The idea being that yeah, the Romans weren't the complete bad guys and terrorists and anti colonial rebellions aren't always noble etc.

3480696,4,B001B2U1AA,"Monty Python, the famous comedy group from Great Britain, is not everybody's taste of humour. You either like them or hate them. ""The Life of Brian"" is a movie though which is able to fill this gap between liking and disliking. ""The Life of Brian"" is a religious satire which is nothing for conservatives. Brian is a young Judean born on the same day as Jesus. During his life he is always confronted with Jesus, religious fanaticism and the Roman occupation. He becomes a part of the PFJ ( People's Front of Judea), a fanatic movement that fights against the Romans. Through a silly coincidence the people of Jerusalem think that Brian is the Messiah and so the admiration for him begins. Finally Brian fulfils the real destiny of Jesus and is crucified. ""The Life of Brian"" is full of nasty and absurd humour which will entertain everybody. It's convincing right from the start. Furthermore, the film is not only about Brian himself, but also about his very ""charming"" mother Mandy.

Before I watched ""The Life of Brian"" I was also one of the sceptic ones. Monty Python was not really my type of humour and I don't think it will ever be, but I have to admit that this movie is really funny and that I enjoyed it.

3480701,5,B001B2U1AA,"Perhaps the greatest comedy film of all time.

From start to finish The Holy Grail is full of classic comedy moments brilliant gags and incredible twists.

There is so many interesting points to write about this film, so here it goes!!!!

What's brilliant too is the fact the script is brilliant to, so to is the realism of the acting, for example the way they modernised the characters to fit into ancient times.

Not to be mixed up with the story of Jesus, it is more a anti terrorist group film, note the People's Front of Judea who are seemingly for the freedom of the Jews hate all other Jewish freedom groups, although they all seem to want the same thing. This is best exemplified in a scene where the PPJ meet another Jewish freedom group who have the same plan to capture the Romans pilots wife but instead of working together they fight each other for the right to have the credit of the capture.

That's weird, that reminds me of all those terrorist groups who say they hate America????

That makes you wonder, are they doing their terror work to free people or is it for their own purposes???????

Indeed just about everything has been taken the piss out of in this film apart from Jesus, and so anyone who claims this to be a ridicule of the story of Jesus probably hasn't seen the film at all or properly.

Another complaint was the way it portrays Jews, well it actually portrays them like normal everyday people,some are normal, and some not so normal. Although there is a funny scene where Brian declares how prowd he is to be Jewish.

It also underlines how people are portrayed as saviours without people knowing about them, brilliant example is Brian who is mistaken for a missiah and when fleeing from a mass group he eventually runs out of steam and hides, though eventually found the people believe he has led them somewhere, where infact as Brian rightly put it... 'You followed me.'

It is also interesting how The Romans are portrayed. The are looked on in the film as a very advanced and sociliased people but who know how to bring law and order to a place, and very expertly so. Although it is the leaders of the Romans (i.e The Emperours) who are portrayed as the real Roman idiots, just ask Bigus Dickus!!!!!!

Also the use of swearing is brilliant, it is used as a use to express emotion, and never overused (a problem that persists in many modern day comedies). It is used to add flavour to the comedy not to become the comedy.

The Life of Brian is best watched, Christmas and Easter times for it's full comedy effect, but you will still laugh your socks off if you watch it any other time of the year.

The oddity of Life of Brian is that it's a tragic film as the innocent Brian ends up being a marter of a cause he didn't create but others around him did. It's weird how the innocent always suffer first???????.

The Life of Brian along with The Holy Grail are definitely two recommended Monty Python films, and certainly two of the best comedy films ever.",1117324800,,2992,4.46605504587156
3480702,4,B001B2U1AA,"Of course not.  Because in this day and age, I would be branded as a heretic or labeled insane and thus thrown out of the way in an insane asylum.  With that out of the way, the Life of Brian is an accurate comedy brought to us by Monty Python that makes a VERY valuable and intelligent point about organized religion.  The Catholic Church (and others) have changed so much that it isn't even the same thing anymore.  People misinterpret things whether it be a gourd or a sandal, and it becomes completely out of hand.  I know that this isn't necessarily the right place to post it, but as an atheist, I feel that God exists to explain the unexplained.  With that out of the way, let's continue with the review.  It's absolutely filled with laughs.  I could hardly stay still when the roman guard had Brian correct the misspellings of his graffiti.  The Bigus Dicus scene is absolutely classic and the even more classic ""always look on the bright side of life"" (curse my lack of ability to whistle).  There are only a few problems with this DVD.  One, this is a poor DVD, there is only one disc, and hardly and extras worth paying attention to.  The far better Criterion collation version has that second disc that Holy Grail and Meaning of life possess yet for some reason for life of Brian is 30 dollars, whereas Meaning of Life and Holy Grail are significantly cheaper then the superior version of Brian.  The second problem which is not quite as irritating is that for me (and this may only have been for me) I find that their accents are a lot thicker in this film.  I enjoy the English accent as much as the next guy, but some times, I find myself going ""what he just say?"" and having to find myself rewinding so I can focus better to see what that last line was.  That still doesn't affect the overall impact and message of the film or its brave humor or its originality.  This movie deserves 5 stars but this DVD is getting 4 for the lack of features and inferiority to the overpriced 2 Criterion collection version.  The Life of Brian may challenge the idea of organized religion, but it is not made to offend anybody.  It makes a valuable point but the only ones who were really shocked or appalled by this film were us Americans.  Fellow reviewer Isala has explained why, so I won't repeat what they said.  If you are unsure of this film still, then rent it.  If you then find yourself offended, then you just have to loosen up and relax a bit.  That's pretty much all I have to say.  Try to get the Criterion collection for a low price if you're a big fan, but if you are a casual fan then this version will do just fine.  Hoped this helped.",1115942400,,2653,4.345528455284553
3480703,4,B001B2U1AA,"I knew I had to see this movie immediately after watching The Meaning of Life, which unleashes three sketches of scathing (and did I mention hilarious?) satire at the expense of Catholicism and Protestantism.  On that note, I would like to point out that the comedy of Monty Python is so brilliantly funny NOT because its punchlines target God or the teachings of Jesus, but rather the innate flaws of the very Human institutions that mandate them.  To this end, anyone with faith who can recognize and identify with the very stupidity that separates humans from God in the first place should be able to laugh along WITH the Pythons.

  Unfortunately, the controversy from some of the more sensitive religious reviewers posted on this site led me to believe that The Life of Brian would contain more of the same spot on satire as contained in The Meaning of Life.  Any religious satire contained in this movie, however, was subtle at best.  Though funny, even brilliant at parts, the humor of this movie is centered more around life in Biblical TIMES rather than actual Biblical EVENTS.  This fact also, strangely enough, leads me to assume that some of the people submitting reviews of this film ... like, i don't know, say the guy who thought he had the moral authority to declare that Graham Chapman's death from cancer was inflicted by God as a direct consequence for making this movie ... have never even seen it.  But I guess that this is the exact brand blind ignorance the movie is ultimately making fun of, isn't it?  So I guess the joke is on you.

At any rate, although the movie gets even funnier with familiarity and offers its share of classic Python scenes (the Biggus Diccus, Haggling, and Stoning scenes all had me in stitches), I preffered both The Meaning of Life and The Holy Grail to The Life of Brian because of the greater variety of humor offered in the hodge-podge of shorter storylines.  But it's definitely worth watching ... and if you're a fan: the extras on the criterion collection make it worth owning. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  And maybe if you're lucky, God won't even smite you if you chuckle here and there.",1112918400,,2158,4.647368421052631

3480705,5,B001B2U1AA,"Their belief in organised religion and political organisations might be shaken though...
Most people have already seen this film probably, but this DVD contains the four scenes deleted the day before the premiere. They are viciously funny, but had to be cut since they broke the rythm of the story.
The main reason to watch this film is that it is very funny. This is Python at their peak. It is not a collection of skits like The Holy Grail, it is a real film with a clever and tight story. Beautifully directed by Jones and Gilliam, and again reaffirming the acting genius of Graham Chapman, who is probably sharing a joke or two with Jesus in heaven as of now.
The Pythons have admitted that they set out to write a parody of Jesus, but when they studied the bible they saw to their surprise that his teachings made sense! Let me state this: THE PYTHONS ADMIT TO ACTUALLY RESPECT AND ADMIRE JESUS. They then wondered what to do; they then understood that the problem with christianity is not Jesus - it's organised religion! Leaders who interpret Jesus's teachings to fit their own beliefs and needs, and then demand that we, the rest, make them our needs and beliefs.
It is mainly in the US the film has caused a controversy: other countries where the competition between churches is less and the need to control the ""flock"" is less urgent the film is not seen as as dangerous.
Not content with attacking organised religion they actually deliver an even more scathing attack on political extremists - something which tends to be forgotten in the hue-and-cry over the alleged heresy of the film.
The essence of the film is that we should just get on with our lives, don't let anyone manipulate us, or get swept up in hysterical mass-movements. Brian learns it the hard way when he in the end becomes a ""symbol"" - not a human anymore - and he is more valuable dead than alive to the movement he, unwillingly, created.
In a funny twist to the film the Roman occupiers come out as quite sympathetic charatcers - after all, they represent an authority governed by reason and law, not by whim and charisma.",1112054400,,2104,4.583554376657825
3480706,5,B001B2U1AA,"'Monty Python's Life of Brian' is quite possibly the best comedy ever made, although it is not the funniest.  It is not even the funniest Python movie; that honor goes to 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.'  Many would agree with this and thus contend that 'Holy Grail' is the better film, but in terms of the depth of its social commentary and the wryness of its satire it pales in comparison to 'Life of Brian.'

  'Life of Brian' brilliantly exposes the absurd and hypocritical side of religious fanatacism, a theme that predictably incited the protests of the right-wing Christian nutbag faction, who are always on hand to declare that anything they disagree with is evil.  What is often overlooked is that the movie doesn't attack Christianity, it attacks the warping and misuse of that religion by its followers.  Christ makes an appearance at the beginning and ends up the only character in the entire film not infused with Monty Python cartoonishness.  It is obvious that he is not the central focus.  Instead we are given fanatics so sheeplike and braindead they've declared Brian a Messiah before they know anything about him, and are prepared to kill before accepting the viewpoint that he might just be a man.  I suppose this will rattle a right wing Christian about as much as an attack on Jesus himself.

  Of course the social insights are far from the only reason to view Life of Brian; it is also extremely funny and an excellent party movie.  The quotable dialogue is constant and the memorable scenes are innumerable.  The sarcastic cellmate, the cheerful crucifee, the taunter of big-nosed people, and Pontius Pilate and his friend Biggus Dickus all recall unforgettable moments.  The final crucifixion scene is an absolute stunner, and one of the most remarkable things you'll ever see in a comedic film.  It's funny, touching, poignant and has more to say about the meaning of life than most films by 'serious' directors.  It will also have you whistling for several days, so beware.",1109548800,,2004,4.8613569321533925

The plot is simple, some high class running gags, parody the early story of Jesus by having a man named Brian accidentally picked as Savior, and then just have a whole good time with what the story gives you (and since they wrote it, they found a lot.)

Whether literal humor, or wit, the Life of Brian is a classic in many people's eyes.  I was worried that I had been built up by other's saying this film was great, including the Criterion Collection.  I did not want my hopes to fall, and thankfully they did not.

This is a classic Monty Python film, and really just a classic comedy.  The Criterion people added tons of good extras too, which will thrill the dedicated fan.  Like I said though, excellent humor like Monty Python does so well.",1105401600,,1011,4.456521739130435
3480710,5,B001B2U1AA,"Firstly I would only recommend The Life Of Brian to either a) die-hard Python fans b) someone with a genuinely warped sense of humour, and of course c) a complete nutter. If none of the above fits your frame I would suggest to stay away, as you will in all probability have your IQ offended. If not, WATCH THIS FILM!!!

The plot is very loosely based on the general hatred towards the romans, despite the fact they brought education, sanitation, roads, wine, pretty much everything in society back then. Brian is born, not far from Jesus causing a brief confusion for the three wise men, he leads a normal life until he falls for a woman. This woman is not just any woman, she's a member of the People's Front Of Judea, not to be mistaken for the [...] Judean People's Front. Brian joins the group and is caught by the romans during a failed mission to capture Pilot's wife. Brian escapes and somehow finds himself being followed by hundreds of people claiming him to be the Messiah. Brian is eventually caught and crucified (there's a very funny running joke about how pathetic crucifixion is) and all of his friends fail to save him, even the dreaded Judean People's Front fail, commiting suicide and claiming ""eh, that showed 'em"".

The film contains so many funny moments, I'll just list a few:

Palin as Caesar is superb, he's got a speech impediment and can't say the letter 'r' without pronouncing it 'w'. He has a friend named Bigus Dicus who also has a speech impediment, this time it's the 's' that's the problem.

One joker who keeps popping up has an argument with another man while Jesus is trying to speak, he keeps saying the man has a big nose - ""Well it is true, you do have a very big nose"" - ""I'm only pointing out the obvious, you've got a very big nose."" - ""shut up big nose"" - ""listen big nose"". It's very funny when you watch it.

The funniest bit in the whole film is when Brian is being chased by the Romans and runs up a spire, only to find there's no stairs down so he jumps to certain death. Luckily for him an alien spaceship swoops down and saves him, goes back up into space, has an engine failure and crashed about five foot away from where it all started. Brian walks out and a man who watched it all says ""You lucky bastard!""

I won't go in to any more detail, you just have to watch the film.",1100131200,,2327,4.350230414746544
3480711,5,B001B2U1AA,"It's a no-brainer to give a rave review to Monty Python's classic ""The Life of Brian""... in fact if you're actually in need of reading a review about this film then I suggest you put away your DVD of the first season of Friends and go pick up some Monty Python before you disintigrate into mocha latte dust.

You'll find great comedy in this movie; comedy that not only makes you laugh but also makes you think back the next day and realize how bloody genius these guys are. For those not familiar with the story, ""Brian"" is a parody of the story of Jesus Christ. Don't worry Ned Flanders, this film is all tongue and cheek and despite having some political commentary on religion it is, nonetheless, a harmless spoof.

If you know anything about Python you know that it is comprised of five Brits (and a lesser known American, Terry Gilliam, whose more the director than anything - he also does all those wild animations). The six of them are above all extremely intelligent individuals who are literally experts on comedy. They play most of if not all of the characters so sometimes you have, say, John Cleese playing both a roman soldier and a Jewish rebel in the same scene.

Their sense of humour is a perfect combination of both dry wit and outrageous slapstick. In one scene, for example, where Brian (played by Graham Chapman) is selling ""wolf nipple chips and leopard foreskins"" to spectators at the gladiator match, you have a dialogue between Brian and The People's Front of Judea that is sheer genius in commenting on the absurdity of the underground movements in Jerusalem. In the exact same scene, as if to contrast, you have a slapstick routine of a slave and gladiator going at it in the arena. Don't quite understand? You really need to see it for yourself.

The DVD is great because the bonus material includes a documentary titled ""The Pythons"". It's basically an in-depth look at the psyche of both the collective and the individual members of the group. It's insightful, interesting and hilarious. You'll love it.

""The Life of Brian"" is a must-have for any self respecting fan of comedy. They influenced such greats as Kids In the Hall, The Simpsons and, my favorite, Christopher Gest of Spinal Tap fame. I don't like ""cannonizing"" things but if you really want to twist my arm then I truly believe that Monty Python are among the few truly genuinely funny people the world will ever know, and if all comedy were this good the world would be a better place.",1099440000,,2479,4.637813211845103

3480713,3,B001B2U1AA,"Coming on the heels of the wildly popular and iconic ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Life of Brian"" was bound to suffer by comparison. Still, even after compensating for inflated expectations, this film is a bit of a disappointment.

Purporting to follow the life of Brian Cohen, born in Bethlehem on the same night as a more illustrious son of Judea, ""Life of Brian"" lampoons human nature mercilessly. And by putting Brian in situations that parallel the life of Christ, the film gets to comment on the absurdities of pious religious practice, all while keeping a respectful distance from Christ himself. Brian is mistaken for a Messiah by credulous crowds and is literally chased out of town by wannabe disciples. There are some funny moments as the believers immediately split into factions based on which of Brian's belongings -- his shoe or his gourd -- they wish to worship. Unfortunately, many of the gags fall somewhat flat. A scene at the Jerusalem coliseum, in which members of a Jewish resistance groups debate their political agenda, goes on much too long, replacing humor with profanity. It's hard to escape the conclusion that after ""Holy Grail"" the Python troupe spent too little time on this film, preferring to rely on absurdist humor that lacked satirical edge. Without incisive insights into human behavior, the jokes tend toward ""Benny Hill"" slapstick rather than Pythonesque exquisiteness.

That said, there are some moments of near-genius that make the film enjoyable. The Centurion's public school style raking of Brian for misspelling Latin graffiti is hilarious. And depicting Pontius Pilate as an effete lisper was inspired. (""Fwoh him to the gwound...and woughwy!""). The opening scene, in which distant listeners misunderstand Christ's Sermon on the Mount (""Blessed are the cheese makers!""), is nearly perfect, and says much about the sorry lot of humanity that Christ came to save. The rest of the film struggles to maintain even a middling standard of hilarity. Sometimes, the jokes completely bomb, such as Terry Gilliam's animated and pointless (Ha! Ha! It has nothing to do with the film!) outer space sequence. Sometimes the movie positively offends, such as the crucifixion sequence in which the victims sing about the meaninglessness of life. If any sentiment is insulting to Christ, it is that one.

The funniest thing to come from England since The Stamp Act, Monty Python's Flying Circus could always be depended upon to provide the world with brilliantly twisted humor. The LIFE OF BRIAN is no less a comic masterpiece than anything else these boys have done. Ostensibly a parody of the life of Jesus, LIFE OF BRIAN is a hilarious attack on liberalism, conservatism, colonialism, individualism, communalism, organized religion, disorganized religion, fanaticism, feminism... take your pick of any of a hundred topics. It doesn't matter, it's still brilliant. And the script and direction holds it perfectly all together, even if there's a space ship chase sequence thrown in for the hell of it.
Once again, the members of MPFC each play several roles and every viewer has his or her favorites, so what the hell, I'll mention mine. Michael Palin, while playing a wonderfully foppy Pontius Pilate, is equally hilarious as a twitchy, hyperactive leper that Jesus had cured. Instead of being grateful, he complains that his rehabilitation has ruined his livelihood as a beggar. (Speaking of rehabilitation, Palin plays the part like a junkie in need of a fix.) John Cleese has several great moments, but his role as a Centurion turned sadistic Latin teacher is nothing short of genius. Everyone who has studied Latin will be beside themselves during this scene. And Terry Jones as Brian's mom still stuns me 25 years later. ""My Brian is not the messiah!

The film parallels the story of Jesus but it takes us in another direction, to see a population who can't seem to think for themselves. They must have a Messiah to follow and they think they have found one in Brian. But Brian isn't interested in being their Messiah.
My favorite line is when a crowd calls for Brian to come to the window and show himself. His mother opens the window and tells the crowd: ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy."" The Monte Python ensemble has a knack for making us laugh at situations that when seen from their satirical point-of-view, are quite ludicrous.
The point of the film is our longing to belong and to follow a leader. Yes, if you look at it from that approach we are all sheep. We must flock and we must follow. We are all constantly searching for that Messiah to lead us. And yes, we see it in the modern world where good leadership is quite deficient. The crowds roar together, ""Yes, we are individuals."" ""Yes, we must think for ourselves."" But do we?
This film will offend some, but it is harmless fun and sometimes you have to trust having fun. After all, isn't this what Jesus' life was about, teaching how to get along and connect with other fellow human beings, as well as spiritual redemption?

Criterion has released an excellent Special Edition with commentaries, a documentary, and deleted scenes; however, the price of it is pretty steep. If you're a Python fan, you'll want to spend the money on the Criterion Collection DVD. If you have a more casual interest in the film, or just don't want to spend so much money, then this DVD will satisfy your needs. Either way, you'll get one of the funniest films ever made.
With Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" ringing up box-officer registers and inflaming controversy, it's never been a better time to re-visit this classic but also controversial film from the Monty Python troupe, which takes on the story of the Messiah in a hysterical, yet sharply satiric, way. It's the best piece of work the Pythons ever produced, exceeding all their other movies and their television programs. Instead of merely stringing together sketches around a common theme, as they usually did, the Pythons here created a wonderful, coherent story with consistent themes and a steady target for their cynical humor. It's not only a wonderful comedy, it's really a wonderful character drama as well!
No big producer would touch the controversial material, so the film was funded with the help of former Beatle George Harrison. Although filmed on a tiny budget, the work of director Terry Jones and designer Terry Gilliam make it look as handsome as a multi-million dollar Cecil B. DeMille epic. (It helped that they had sets available from Zefferelli's recent TV mini-series ""Jesus of Nazareth"" still around for their use.)
The story follows the misadventures of Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who was born just down the street in Bethlehem on the same night as another famous baby. Brian's life parallels Jesus's (glanced occasionally, played by Ken Colley), only in a completely mistaken, unintentional way. He becomes part of the People's Front of Judea, becomes an unwitting rebel, then an unwitting messiah to a group of mindless followers (""Yes, we are all individuals!"" they shout together), and then an unwitting martyr. (Which leads to the classic finale song, ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."")
John Cleese in interviews has tried to distance the film from being a direct attack on Christianity, saying it was really meant to criticize the mentality of people who follow leaders without question. However, ""Life of Brian"" is very cynical about religion in general, there's no mistaking that. But it doesn't have to be viewed as an insult to the Christian religion at all, as many claimed it was. It also makes fun of historical epics, gender roles, ""Star Wars"" (in a very funny special-effects sequence created by Terry Gilliam), and people who would rather fight with those who agree with them than with their common enemy.
There's also no mistaking that this is one of funniest films ever made. Hysterical scene piles up on hysterical scene: John Cleese as a priest trying to control a mob at a stoning; Michael Palin as the world's least inspiring prophet (""And then a friend shall lose his friend's hammer...""); Eric Idle forcing Graham Chapman to haggle when he doesn't want to; Michael Palin's lisping and completely ridiculous Pontius Pilate (""Thwow him to floor, Centoorion!""); John Cleese as the leader of the P.F.J. trying to prove that the Romans have done nothing for Judea, despite his followers many claims to contrary (the aqueduct, the roads, the court systems, education, wine, sanitation...); and Terry Jones as Brian's mother telling his crowd of followers: ""He's not the Messiah! He's a very naughty boy!""  My personal favorite scene has John Cleese's centurion correcting Graham Chapman's Latin in the anti-Roman graffiti he's painting on the palace walls.
I would like to point out what an excellent actor Graham Chapman was. All the Python's were brilliant comedic performers and writers, but Chapman was a very talented, pure actor. He could have played dramatic roles as easily and comic ones, and there's a reason he took the lead role in this film. His sincerity in the role of Brian really holds the film together. It's a tragedy that he died so young.
Grab this DVD for gut-busting comedy and satire - unless you want to lay down the dough for the Criterion Collection (which I think is worth it).",1078185600,,4411,4.993206521739131
3480724,4,B001B2U1AA,Life of Brian as performed by the Monty Python troup is just as nonsensical as all Python movies. But this one is a little too confusing... to where you aren't sure if they are trying to be funny or just rash. There are some very cleaver moments that make this movie one of the funniest compared to modern comedies released in the thearters today. But overall it was a string of sexual inuendo's with a muttled story line.,1077667200,,422,4.423076923076923
3480725,3,B001B2U1AA,"I love Holy Grail and all of the Flying Circuses, and was excited to see this film. I was very disappointed with it. While it did have some funny parts, such as Pontius Pilate and Biggus' speech impediments and the roman graffiti, a lot of it was unnecessary and sacreligious. Was it important to the story to show Graham Chapman fully naked? What about the other woman's nudity, pushing the envelope even for some of today's standards. If that was what I wanted to see in a movie, I would have never turned to Monty Python. I also found the movie to be very sacreligious. While there were no direct attacks on Christ or Christians in general, the different situations in the movie were screaming blasphemy. A lot of religious parodies are aimed at Christianity, and to be honest, I think that if this moive would have referred to Islam or Hinduism, or any other religion, it would be seen as degrading towards that religion. Putting that aside, though, the movie was funny. Eric Idle's song, ""The Bright Side Of Life"" is a classic. The roman graffiti will always be remembered, and the rivalry between the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front was humorous. Overall, the movie was very average in humor, but is pulled down dramatically by the blasphemy in the film. I don't recommend it unless you are a huge Monty Python fan.",1077321600,,1343,4.647058823529412
3480726,5,B001B2U1AA,"....That isn't an early Mel Brooks or Richard Lester movie! This film pretty much made me a fan of the Pythons, leading me to go see a retrospective of theirs including ""And Now For Something Completely Different"", ""Jabberwocky"" and ""Monty Python & The Holy Grail"". By far the most ingenious and well written thing they've done since and maybe SLIGHTLY funnier than ""Grail"", this movie makes fun of zealotry, hypocrisy, decadence, dumb luck and history, all in one fell swoop!

The movie generally involves a case of mistaken identity that affects a Nazarene named Brian, born on the same day as, and right downstream from, you-know-who. This mistake affects Brian's life through the course of the entire movie, even after he joins a fanatic sect of Roman-hating terrorists. Though the Wise Men who mistook him for Jesus early in the film corrected themselves, Brian still has a hard time convincing the sheepish, desperate people who follow him everywhere that he isn't a messiah while trying to escape Roman capture.

Cleese, Idle and Palin especially shine in this film, playing many disparate parts...Cleese as 1) A Roman centurion, 2) Reg, the leader of a terrorist faction Brian happens onto, and 3) A high priest/Pharisee/Sadducee - whatever, holding a zany trial for someone who has said the Lord's name in vain; Idle as: 1) Stan, a terrorist with gender identity problems, 2) A crazy but extremely lucky guy who never gets crucified though he's due for it, 3) A guy who taunts a fellow at the sermon on the mount by repeatedly calling him ""Bignose"", 4) A stuttering gravedigger, 5) A stoning rock, false beard and gourd vendor and 6) The guy who sings ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life"" to Brian while hanging from a cross; Palin plays: 1) Pontius Pilate, 2) a particularly zealous member of the terrorist band Brian joins, 2)A squirrelly beggar complaining about being cured, 3) a VERY mild-mannered head counter at Brian's crucifiction, 4) The guy Idle taunts at the sermon on the mount and 5) A verbose false prophet. Even Chapman, the one playing Brian, also plays the role of Biggus Dickus, the lisping friend of Pontius Pilate as well as the hapless ""Red Sea pedestrian"" himself. Terry Jones plays Brian's mother and an ascetic who has his vow of silence ruined by Brian stepping on his foot.

When I first saw this movie, I didn't remember laughing so much since seeing Richard Lester's ""Help!"" and ""Hard Day's Night"" at the Circle In The Square up in Greenwich Village back in 1967. A true masterpiece of zany comedy as only the British seem able to do it.

Wouldn't it be great to see either Rowan Atkinson's or ""Grant/Naylor's"" take on religion? The possibilities are endless!",1074038400,,2701,4.83982683982684
3480727,5,B001B2U1AA,"Well, the message behind Life Of Brian, to take a line from Bob Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues,"" extols people ""don't follow leaders,"" and blindly at that. This biblical send-up has sight gags, barbed and hilarious lines and situation, funny voices, which all flow like milk and honey here.
The setting is in Judea, AD 33, and Jesus is preaching his Sermon on the Mount, you know ""Blessed are the cheesemakers"" or was that ""Blessed are the Greek""?  But there is quite a bit of disharmony going on in the back row.
My three favourite scenes have to be the stoning, the Roman grammar lesson and the scene where Brian (Graham Chapman) is first brought before Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin).  When one Matthias is sentenced to be stoned for committing blasphemy, saying ""Jehovah,"" the lynch-mob crowd mentality is demonstrated by an automatic launching of a stone at that word.  As the Jewish priest (John Cleese) says, ""Now look, no one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle.  Do you understand?  Even, and I will make this perfectly clear, even if they do say Jehovah.""  Guess what happens?
The second scene:  After falling in with the People's Front of Judea, led by Reg (Cleese), Brian is instructed by them to write ""Romans Go Home.""  He is caught (gasp!), but because this is Monty Python, he gets a grammar lesson from the centurion (Cleese) on duty, so remember, it is not ""ROMANES EUNT DOMUS.E
And the third scene brings me out in giggles the same way as the Roman guards, not only because of Pilate's gay lisp, but because of his friend's name, which has the guards trying hard not to dissolve into laughter.  His friend's name?  First name is Biggus.
Another theme that's brought into light is the way a conquering people brings some benefits to its conquered, and Dr. Davies, my Western Civ. teacher, showed this part of the video to demonstrate it.  Reg (Cleese) rhetorically asks his PFJ cohorts what the Romans have done for the Jews?  To which they list the aqueduct, wine, irrigation, among other things, to which Reg reluctantly concedes.  The punchline is that the Romans to some extent, have brought peace to a previously unstable region.
Palin has the best roles as ""Big Nose"", an ex-leper, a crazed prisoner, and Pontius Pilate, and Cleese does great as a Roman centurion, Reg, and the ill-fated Jewish authority figure.
Eric Idle does best as a stuttering Roman guard, a vendor who teaches Brian how to haggle, and Stan, who wants to be a woman and be called Loretta.  BTW, Jesus is played by Kenneth Colley, who was Admiral Piett in both Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi.
This movie is ingenious, irreverent, cheeky, but not offensive or blasphemous.  The lines and jokes are at their barbed best per usual, but the jokes involving crucifixion are the boldest:
As I said, the main message is told by Brian to the people who blindly see him as the Messiah:  ""You've got to think for yourselves.  You're all individuals.  You're all different."" And you'll enjoy this movie,... even if you do say Jehovah!",1071964800,,3045,4.756653992395437
3480728,5,B001B2U1AA,"No doubt the Monty Python group is one of the funniest tv-shows and movie-makers of all time. Their straight-faced, intelligent kind of humor is so everlasting that today, roughly 25 years after their three main movies were made, they still have a huge legion of worldwide fans, and among them very young people, some of them born after their movies were released.
In ""Life of Brian"", the setting is Judea, around 33 A.D. The movie is about Brian, a jewish man-boy, raised by a tough mother; Brian's life is seemingly meaningless, until he joins a hilarious group whose main task is to go against Roman domination. Suddenly, and unwillingly, Brian has an enormous set of followers that, based on strange omens, think he is the Messiah.
From beginning to end, ""Life of Brian"" is much more than just a bunch of nonsense scenes revolving around a common base-point. Of course, the characters are made and chosen to fit the Python actors, but that doesn't mean the acting is bad. John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones (among many others) are still active and very much well-known today or in recent years - 007 series, ""A fish called Wanda"", etc.
But ""Life of Brian"", more than a simple comedy, is a tremendous criticism of the society we live in. It is not blasphemous in any way. Countries and societies that have banned this movie on religious grounds completely missed the point. This is not about religion, it's about people's relationships. To criticize globalization, lack of individualism and misguided leaderships (if they were able to see the problem then, what can we say about nowadays, when it's even worse?) they took as an example the christian societies and religious movements because, being westerners, and making a movie mainly for western audiences, they thought this would be more simple to achieve their goal. Well, in the end it was proved they were really ahead of their time. Even today ""Life of Brian"" is not completely understood, and mistaken as a religious parody.
Congratulations for the Pythons, on the subject choice and on the intelligence with which the movie was made.

3480730,3,B001B2U1AA,"Ahh, the Pythons. What would life be without them? Certainly for me it would be more dull and boring.
Having brilliantly skewered the Arthurian legends in ""Holy Grail"" the Pythons set their irreverent sights yet higher to target the most sacrosanct: the New Testament.
While this has the classic Python-esque wry humor and satire, there's something a little more timid here. The jokes just aren't as funny, the satire isn't as sharp. And the acting just lacks that full-throttle zaniness that I've adored since ""Flying Circus"".
When this film was made ""Flying Circus"" was long gone and each of them was well along in their solo careers. Bringing them back together for this project has the feeling of a worn-out school reunion.
Maybe they had too much money to play around with, too. Much of the charm in ""Holy Grail"" for instance, is the guerilla filmmaking where they had to get absolutely as many laughs for the dollar as possible.
To put it another way, since I purchased ""Holy Grail"" last year I must've watched it 5-6 times. ""Life of Brian"" on the other hand, I've only played once. Will I watch it again? Sure. It IS funny, but not my favorite.
I would give the film 4 stars but for the DVD: the transfer is quite poor. The picture quality looks like the master was taken from a over-rented VHS tape and the sound is all over the place. I often had to resort to subtitles to understand was was being said -- if I raised the volume instead then all the foley effects and music were way too loud.",1054771200,,1501,4.5424354243542435
3480731,5,B001B2U1AA,"Blessed are the cheesemakers!
This is what one line from the Sermon on the Mount is mis-interpreted as being by one of the distant crowd members (remember, Jesus had no microphones or amplification -- you try talking down a mountain and see who hears you correctly!).
And of course, the instant interpretation (obviously emphasising the 'fun' in fundamental interpretation) -- 'he obviously means that to apply to the makers of any dairy products,' is applied by one of the listeners.
I heard this used (and have since myself used) as an example in a sermon of the difficulty of interpretation. And this entire movie is rife with such examples of twisting the biblical (and extra-biblical) stories -- often with hilarious results, but quite frequently one finds oneself laughing because it is accurate, rather than satire. Wasn't it Will Rogers who said 'I don't have to satirise my enemies: I merely have to quote them.'?
Beginning with the birth in the manger through to a crucifixion, our would-be and reluctant messiah embarks on a mad-cap romp through a thoroughly modern-Britainised Palestine of the null-millenium. Just at the Bible leaves out the childhood of Jesus, so does this movie leave out the childhood of Brian -- and I've often wondered of the split in the believers -- those who followed the shoe and those who followed the gourd, which are catholics and which are protestants?
Perhaps the best scene to any prep-school graduate would be the sight of the Roman guard correcting the Latin grammar of Brian the would-be slogan writer and political propagandist.
'It says, ""Romans go home!"",' Brian insists.
'No it doesn't,' the guard replies.  'It says ""People called the Romans they go the house!"" '

This is probably the Python's best work. They use the backdrop of early christianity to offer some of their best and most absurd comedy. As usual, the chaps play numerous roles throughout the film (except for Graham Chapman, who plays Brian) and are hysterically funny in each one.
This is the film that gave us ""The bright side of life"" and the Judean People's Front and their suicide squad.
As for the DVD, it includes a few deleted scenes and some radio ads, but the true treasure are the two commentaries by the remaining members (Graham Chapman passed away in 1989), one by John Cleese and Michael Palin and the other by Eric Idle and both Terrys, and the documentary.

But if a friend asked me what the tone of this movie was, I would answer honestly: brutally mocking, in-your-face sarcastic, and completely contemptuous of the Christ story. I think Christians who don't see this have missed the point and don't seem to take their own beliefs too seriously.

How can one not see here a reflection of Christian misinterpretation and subsequent divisions through the ages? In truth, I know of no other work that in such a light-hearted manner shows me truly who I am.
Monty Python is always great acting, and even better writing; The consummation of British wit. They take reality around them, and twist it, to show us the reality that lies beneath. Some brief unfortunate gratuitous nudity is easily endured. Watching this movie provides innumerable quotes for future use. (""Splitters!"" ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"")

3480737,4,B001B2U1AA,"MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN isn't as funny as MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, but the film is still pretty funny. The movie examines one Brian who was born on the same day as Jesus in a stable just next door. Brian's life parallels Jesus' in a number of ways right up to Brian's undeserving crucifixion. The film contains several hilarious scenes (the stoning, Latin graffiti) and the film's closing song ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" has become a comedy gem.

With that said, the movie can be and is found offensive by many people who find it ridiculing Christianity. I am a Christian myself, but found much of the film to be funny. There were a couple of times that the movie bordered on the offensive (e.g. when Brian is preaching the words of Jesus in the streets of Jerusalem), but overall I could see and enjoy the humor without taking it too seriously. Still, it does make one wonder, why Monty Python examined the life of Brian on a concurrent course with Jesus. Why couldn't they have had Brian living at the same time as Muhammed or Buddha or Confucius? I think we all know the answer to that. The answer justifies many people's rejection of this film and even though I found most of the movie funny, I don't blame them for being offended.",1044748800,,1262,4.463203463203463
3480738,5,B001B2U1AA,"Okay, so there's been a lot of controversy over this film.
Admittedly, I am a big Python fan, and I think that all of their works are marvellous, but I understand that not everyone can appreciate the Pythonesque humour.
This film is probably the most different from the other works of Python, because this story is about one person, not just a bunch of sketches thrown together. The film has a nice flow to it, and focuses mainly on the one character.
As for the bit about being blasphemous, you probably will have to decide for yourself. In my opinion it isn't. Christ only appears twice in this movie (giving a sermon on the mount, and his birth) and his roles are of a serious nature. The only scene which could possibly offend is when the ex-leper refers to Christ as being a ""Bloody do-gooder"".
A quote from Terry Jones:
""There was nothing funny about what Christ said and what's funny really is the fact that Christ said all these really good things about Love Thy Neighbor and everything, and then for the next two thousand years people are killing each other and torturing each other because they can't quite decide how he said it.""
Think about that before you go calling this film blasphemous. This film has some very important morals that everyone should consider, and it never directly attacks Christ.
As for comparing it to the Holy Grail... you can't. They are both excellent films. They can both be very silly and very hilarious. If you've only seen the Holy Grail, and you liked it, then you should give this movie a try.
Basically there are three types of people:
1) People who love all the works Monty Python.
2) People who only like the Holy Grail.
3) People who think it's stupid (maybe they're the stupid ones??)
If you're #1, then this dvd is great. It's great having the extra scenes, they're a real bonus, and in my opinion, worth getting.
If you're #2, and haven't seen Life of Brian, give it a go. Maybe you'll turn out to be a #1 after all!!
And to the #3's, you have the right to your own opinion.
A very funny film. The best thing about it, is that even though it has been nearly 25 years since it came out (well before I was born), you'll find that people of many different ages can still enjoy this film.

3480741,5,B001B2U1AA,"I rented ""Life of Brian"" because I wanted to see if Python could follow up the phenominal success of ""Holy Grail"". To say the least, ""Brian"" lives up to the hype.
""Life of Brian"" is the story of Brian of Nazareth, a poor peasant born suspiciously close to Jesus who helps the Jews fight the Romans. Though a little weird in places, ""Brian"" is typical Python lunacy. I found myself on the floor laughing at some points.
The DVD version is really nothing to gawk at. It's just a few special features, a menu, and great graphics from a VHS. So I guess that the heart and soul of the DVD is the movie itself and that's enough for me.
I recommend this for any Python fan. ""Life of Brian"" is a fun hour and a half of comedy, religion and course language. ...",1032307200,,752,4.229166666666667
3480742,5,B001B2U1AA,"Like so few others, LoB is a film that only gets better with time and repeated viewing. It is often unsurpassed in wisibility, and is as intelligent as it is funny.
Originally opposed by the church, the film is an excellent look at the stupidity of people in masses - whether within the film or around the time of its initial release. The DVD provides some great insight regarding the latter - including mention of a quote from some newspaper ""columnist"" insisting that ""Monty Python himself was crucified at the end of the film"". Really? From what I know, Monty Python was never an actual person.
The film is fun to watch alone, or with fwiends - call Woger, Wodewick (the wobber and wapist) and the others, and see the film. That is, assuming that you've been living under a wock for the last twenty or so years and haven't seen it already.",1032307200,,842,4.509803921568627
3480743,5,B001B2U1AA,"In my opinion, the Python team's finest film.  Unlike their other efforts, which I have also enjoyed, the film has a continuous story, rather than being a series of sketches.
The film does not make fun of or put down Jesus and Christianity. The film makes a statement about how some people seem to lose the ability to think for themselves and act a bit crazy when they assemble together.  The whole message of the film seems to be 'Think for yourself and don't follow the masses'.  Graham Chapman is fine as the lead part, Brian.  All of the other Pythons are great in their various parts.  I particularly like John Cleese as Reg, the leader of the Judean People's Front. His 'What have the Romans done for us' bit is hysterical. The Front is reminicent of the activists who have to sit in meetings and discuss things for ages before they do anything.
Watch for appearances by Spike Milligan, tbe man who created the great radio comedy program, 'The Goon Show', which the Python's acknowledge as one of their major influences, and also a 'blink and you'll miss him' appearance by ex-Beatle and executive producer George Harrison.
Avoid the Anchor Bay barebones DVD which contains only the film and the trailer.  Buy the one that says 'The Criterion Collection' on the top of the front cover.  This one has a transfer which was supervised and approved by the director, Terry Jones, who also puts in a hilarious performance as Brian's Mother, The Virgin Mandy.
The Criterion release includes two commentaries, one with Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, and Terry Jones and one with John Cleese and Michael Palin. Deleted scenes from a 3/4 inch tape that Terry Jones had.  4 radio ads, which feature mainly Mothers of the Pythons (John Cleese's Mother actually won an award from the British advertising industry for her ad) The final extra is an hour long documentary called 'The Pythons' which was shot in Tunisia while the Python troupe were making 'Life of Brian' there. Oh yes, the theatrical trailer is included, too.
A very good package of extras for a relatively low budget comedy that was filmed in 1979.  As usual, Criterion has put together a fantastic package, which is a must for the Python fan.

The film centers around Brian, a person whom a group of people think is the Messiah(Wish I could spell it right).  He then goes on all sorts of confusing experiences, although I fould little intrest in any of them.  To me, the main problem with life of Brian is that it just isint funny.  If you are looking for a Holy Grailesq comedy film, then I recommend you should look elseware.  All but a few of the jokes fall flat(The ones that survive include the stoning sequence and the spaceship).

Even though the Pythons have defended this film, saying that it is NOT an attack on Christianity, I still find it quite offensive, I am not a religious person, and the whole messiah thing offends me.  Oh, and what was up with the completly unnesicary sequence where one of the pythons show up completely nude?

As for the DVD itself, the video quality is good, the sound is good, but the extras are very weak (the only one is charachter bios)  Overall, if you are easilly offended, and hate anti religious flims, avoid this at all costs.

Um...Let me get back to you on that

The bad:

3480750,4,B001B2U1AA,"Crowd:  ""We want the Messiah""
Brian's Mum: ""There's no messiah in here.  It's just a mess."" [or something similar]
When the Python's first got together (in what was to be provisionally called 'Baron Took's Flying Circus', after the scriptwriter Barry Took who died last month), John Cleese insisted that the humour would not be based on puns.  Ten years later, he must have been disappointed by bits of the 'Brian' script.  By 1978 the Pythons had split totally as a TV formation, but came together for the occasional film.  The humour overall wasn't as brilliant, and nothing like as experimental, but it still had its moments.
'Brian' was conceived, like Grail, as a series of sketches, which meant that the Pythons could use the rules of sketch production to their advantage, particularly when it solved budgetary problems.  (In what other genre could you find a movie where the main actors get reused in different parts again and again and again?)  But many of the sketches don't quite work -- e.g. 'Shekel for an ex-leper' could have been funnier, and 'Crucifixion?  Good.' just isn't long enough to qualify as a true Python sketch, despite the brilliance of the concept and Palin's acting.  To my mind, the truly magnificent Python sketch in this film, which easily ranks in the Python's Top 10, is John Cleese's  'Stoning' piece, in which he plays a Pharisee mixed up with an awful lot of English public schoolmaster.  This same schoolmasterliness also emerges in the almost-as-wonderful 'Romanes Eunt Domus' sketch, but you need to have endured at least a couple of years of Latin teaching to get the best out of that one.
I heard Michael Palin talk about the first Brian draft in the fall of 1977 up at Oxford.  He was visiting Brasenose, his old college, and he spent the Saturday evening in the JCR telling whoever wanted to listen about 'Ripping Yarns' and this wonderful new plot called 'Brian'.  I don't remember much of what he said, but I recall being slightly disappointed by the movie when I eventually saw it two years later.
I'm not a great believer, but I think the christian church have some justification in complaining about one element.  Overall the Pythons do a pretty good job of steering Brian in a parallel path to Jesus.  It's only when Brian gets put against the wall among all the soothsayers and prophets that he comes too close.  If Brian isn't supposed to be the christ, then it's unlikely he'd be telling parables about the talents, or a man with two sons, or the lilies in the field etc.  (Goodness knows what uproar would have occurred if the Pythons had tried to do the life of a prophet from another religion.)
Despite Eric Idle's 'Always look on the bright side' eventually being adopted by many soccer crowds, the movie ends on an anti-climax, sotto voce, rather like Mark's Gospel.  The Pythons don't even allow Gilliam to explore the afterlife via animation.
The Grail is the funnier of the two movies, but that's because it is entirely silly.  Brian has a couple of serious points to make -- that you should work it all out for yourself, and that factions shouldn't devote all their energies to fighting those whose beliefs come closest to their own.  Two serious points in one movie is enough for me.",1017878400,,3246,4.741992882562277
3480751,5,B001B2U1AA,"The Criterion Collection does it again, with the best possible version of Life of Brian.
First of all, the film itself looks and sounds as good as it will get. Many of the original materials on this film were sadly destroyed in a dispute over Handmade films, which is sad, as this also wiped out all the outtakes from the film, at least all the original materials, negatives, soundtracks, and such.
Luckily, Terry Jones had a 3/4"" videotape of a rough edit of the film, and apparantly some film footage survived too. These materials are used as bonus scenes, and are very enjoyable. Sadly, parts of this videotape seem to have decomposed dramatically, but it is still very interesting watching.
The other features are all very enjoyable. The commentaries are interesting and not self-aggrandizing, as so many commentaries end up being. We get a real insight into the creative process.
There is a documentary here, filmed on location, and it is interesting viewing, though a bit choppy as far as editing goes.
The only part of this dvd that might disappoint is the fact that it doesn't have nearly as much wierd add-ons as the Holy Grail dvd. It's an excellent disc, and well worth owning, but if you are expecting the huge amount of bonus stuff that the Holy Grail has, you will be disappointed.

When this movie was released there was a bit of a hue and cry about it being sacreligious.  As a practicing Roman Catholic I catagorically say it is not.  In fact the two spots where Christ is refered to are actually a very good allegory on two gospel messages (eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear) and of gratitude (were not all 10 made whole?  Where are the other nine.)  No where in the movie does the picture insult Christian belief or Christianity.  This is actually a bit odd as Python has always been an equal oppertunity offender.
We see classic lines and commentary from the list produced in answering the question: ""What did the Roman's ever do for us?""  To Elmer Fudd's cousin Pilate.  Terry Gilliam manages to get an unforgetable animation scene that will catch you off guard, not easy in a Python movie.
John Cleese said the theme of the movie is ""Think for yourself.""  This movie delivers the message with plenty of humor and without insulting Christ.

The Criterian Collection has always been a bastian of quality, but this is one of their best. The extras are magnificant. Having been a long time Python fanatic, i thought there wasn't much i hadn't seen. The deleted scenes are fantastic, (particularly the shepards), but i had seen them before. Best on this release are the British radio spots, (very, very funny) and the wonderful 1979 BBC documentary, ""the Pythons"" filmed on location in Tunisia during the making of Brian. The Python's talk candidly about themselves and each other and there is some sharp, witty, banter.
 No good having good extras if the films not up to much, i hear you cry! Well, rest assured, in Brian you have one of, if not the greatest comedies of all time.
 It is not, as many would believe, an attack on Christ. He appears in two scenes (obviously, not the real one) but is merely peripheral. The closest to the bone this gets is with an ex-leper who claims his begging trade has been damaged since Christ cured him. Hardly extreme blasphemy, is it?
 No, this film is an attack on blind faith, the willingness for people to just follow anybody who says they're the messiah and not think for themselves, and the dangers that follow. Brian (Graham Chapman) is an ordinary man who is mistakenly believed to be the messiah and is mobbed by fickle worshippers. If one scene sums up the entire film it is when Brian's followers are arguing over what Brian's ""sign"" is. Some believe he wants them to take off one of their shoes, like he has done, the other thinks that it means they should gather shoes as a form of worship. In reality, Brian has only lost his shoes through running away from them. This demonstrates how uneducated faith can lead to unwise choices, and arguments among society. Religion, though able to be a power for good, can rip people apart if they do not consider carefully.
 It may seem like a deep message, but don't let that put you off. Brian is full of side splitting moments, and as a film is a lot more satisfactory than it's predeccessor ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" The stoning scene, Pilates address to the people of Rome, what have the Romans ever done for us? These scenes are all classics but there are many more. Please, i urge you, buy this.

Without any didactic aims, it pokes fun at the way human beings anoint and follow religious figures.  The script is very strong, as are the performances. It remains their strongest movie.
The charges of blasphemy are misplaced.  The very first scene of the film establishes this: the three wise men make a mistake when they bring their gifts to Brian, catch their mistake, and take their gifts back (rather abruptly) when they discover the true Christ child in the stable next door.

3480771,5,B001B2U1AA,"So...is it Meaning of Life - OR - Life of Brian?  Just go ahead and try to choose.  Most people I ask say MEANING.  Ask why and they mention the ""Sperm Song"" (I think it was Terry Gilliam who once said that Meaning of Life will probably be the only movie in history to have a full production number about sperm).  It really is so hilarous that you have to pause the movie after to catch your breath.  Next they mention the scene with the grim reaper.  ""You didn't use CANNED sammon...did you?""  And the topless roller derby girls chasing the man to his death.  And don't forget ""the machine that goes ping!""
So...how can I argue the fact that I like Life of Brian so much its on my top 2 favorite comedy movie list.  It ain't easy.  I like BRIAN for the same reason I like the OTHER movie in my top 2 list.  That other movie is the Inspector General.  Graham Chapman's Brian character is much like Danny Kaye's Inspector character.  They are each simple men who are thrown into roles of great stature.  Danny Kaye always liked these kinds of roles and he did them well.  Chapman was the perfect Python to play Brian.  I'm exilarated each time I watch these.  With BRIAN on my shelf...I'll wait for Inspector General widescreen DVD next.
NOTE:  This Criterion edition is not lacking.  Read the listing and you'll see why the price is justified.  My favorite extras are the deleted scenes and the Python documentary ""The Pythons"".

So, anyway, here's pretty much what happens...some dude born in bethlehem is mistaken as the messiah, and is pursued relentlessly by his followers, before being captured by the romans...a few of which who have hilariously unforgettable speech disorders.

This movie never makes fun of Jesus but at the silly people who fallow whatever leader comes along.  It's a wonderful mockery of the Roman political system and is just plain silly, and intelligent at the same time.  Again this isn't an offensive movie unless you're a stupid git like my college roommate who couldn't take it.  Always Look On the Bright Side Of Life, has always been one of the funniest songs ever written just to listen to.  Once you see it in its context you'll die of laughter.

Even people who have seen this numerous times like myself, find something we missed the previous times. It's very clever in that way, that some of the funniest gags are the hardest to spot.
  It is also silly, that in real life the church (mainly the Catholic Church) condemned this movie as blasphemous. It reminds me of the Father Ted comedy, where the film ""The Trials of St. Tibulous"" was showing on Craggy Island, although it had been banned everywhere else, and the Pope and Bishop ordered Father Ted and Father Dougall to protest outside the cinema. Well, all the ensuing publicity and news stories caused it to become the hugest selling movie in Craggy Island history. As Bishop Brennan says ""People came from as far away as Gdensk to see it."" This movie was a bit like that. All the hue and cry from the Churches, just made this more popular and a huge box office hit. Kinda ironic and hilarious in its own right.
This is a really funny movie, and not at all blasphemous, I think God and Christ would split their sides laughing .. after all, they do want mankind to be happy. I'm quite sure, too, that they have a great sense of humour, and would give this 5 stars as well.",982022400,,1297,4.422594142259414

I can't think of another Python piece that combines their wonderfully wacky humor with their scathing attacks on the sacred cows of modern life.  As a seminarian and a Classics major in college, I was especially tickled by the scene where Brian's graffiti is parsed and corrected by the Roman soldier.  It was far too much like my Greek classes! I am a Christian, but I was not offended in the least by anything in this movie.  One enjoys LIFE OF BRIAN best if one understands from the beginning that this is a farce, a satirical comment on our own predilections and prejudices, NOT a commentary on the life of Christ itself.  We should take note that when Christ is present, he is never personally attacked: the Python boys use His appearance as a point of departure, nothing more.  This is evident especially in the scene where Christ is giving the Sermon on the Mount and the crowd at the back thinks He says ""Blessed are the Cheesemakers."" (GET ON WITH IT!) Right.  This is probably the most coherent of the Python movies.  MEANING OF LIFE is fragmented and doesn't hold together as well, while THE QUEST FOR THE HOLY GRAIL, a classic in its own right, suffers a bit from an ending that drags just a bit.  Therefore LIFE OF BRIAN is, in my opinion, the best of the Python movies.  and now for something completely different...",981072000,,1469,4.572519083969466

3480781,3,B001B2U1AA,"The Monty Python team were inspired comic geniuses, who basically stumbled on the discovery that much of the fabric of everyday reality does, in fact, contain the seeds of humor, so that almost anything is potentially funny, taken out of its context.
But this is often a messy process. The Python team therefore grounded the more revolutionary aspects of their humour in a traditional comedy base, using elements of slapstick, funny characterizations, and even schoolboy humor to give their cerebral and surrealist comedy a more stable base. In the loose sketch format of the BBC TV shows, these ingredients had enough room to breathe - the result: comedy legendhood.
Although the Python team made several movies, the Life of Brian is their only movie to attempt a coherent story line. ""The Meaning of Life"" had thematic unity but the narrative was divided into separate sketches; while ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was freed from the constraints of a coherent narrative by being set in the magical time of king Arthur. With ""Brian"", the Python team found themselves forced to present a more coherent story, one that didn't quiet accomodate their surrealist flights of fancy. This is why ""Brian"" relied more heavily on traditional elements of comedy.
We get charater comedy: dated stereotypes of working class militants trying to express themselves beyond their vocabulary, and screechy old British women. Although initially amusing, these characterizations are stretched to last the whole film and become a little trying. They are also somewhat diluted so as not to alienate the potential overseas market. We also get the schoolboy humour of Bigus Dickus and plenty of slapstick, as in the stoning scene, the arena, etc.
Having to lug a story around for the whole film stops them following their muse as they did so brilliantly, particularly in some of their longer sketches from the TV series - See the outstanding ""Bicycling Tour of North Cornwall"" where the story ends up in the British Embassy in Minsk strangely taken over by the bingo-crazed Chinese!
Despite such great set pieces as the ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"" scene, the movie often struggles to wring humor from the confused religio-political situation of ancient Judea. And when the humor starts to drag there is no prospect of surprise relieving the boredom as there was in the TV show.",974851200,,2370,5.033078880407125

3480783,5,B001B2U1AA,"...and blessed are the Pythons, the crackerjack British comedy troupe creating one of the most funniest movies I have seen in a long time.
The Life of Brian has long been one of my most favorite comedies, and no matter how many times I watch it, I cannot help but break out into raucous laughter at the insanity of this film. Truly blasphemous, truly hilarous, John Cleese and his troupe of merry men leave no stone unturned poking fun at anything and everything religious. From brainless mobs finding shoes as signs from God, to a lisping Roman emperor, to the classic cruxifiction song, this movie is not for the religious light-hearted.
Even better, this Criterion Collection version has so many extras, the true fan will be preoccupied for many hours enjoying it all. Especially wonderful were the deleted scenes and the running commentary by members of the troupe. Also, I appreciated the subtitles. For once I was able to get more of the jokes due to the British accents hard to understand with this untrained ear. If all DVD's were this rich, I'd be a happy camper.

Instead, I will focus on the extras that the DVD  offers, so you can decide if you want to spend the extra money.
There are  a plethora of extras, including a couple of commentaries (the commentary  with Cleese and Palin is superior to that of Jones, Gilliam, and Idle,  IMHO), some cut scenes, and even the radio ads.  The cut scenes even have  commentaries!  The scenes that were cut in the final edit probably deserve  to be cut, but for different reasons.  There is an opening scene with  shepherds that simply drags on and isn't particularly funny.  A bunch of  stuff cut from the kidnapping of Pilate's wife scene, which is a little  confusing and goes on too long, and the intro scene to the Suicide Squad  that appears at the end of the movie.  This scene is, for me, far more  offensive than anything that finally appeared in the movie (a Jewish-Nazi  resistance group, complete with a speech on the ethnic purity).  It is also  very funny, but you feel uncomfortable laughing at it.
There are also  some British radio ads that are amusing, and a fairly in-depth featurette  on the making of the movie.  Some of the issues raised in the making-of  feature are repeated in the commentary(ies), but it's still  interesting.
Thus, this DVD has it all for the Monty Python fan - the  movie itself, the commentaries and featurette that give the background on  the story and info on how and why scenes were shot, some nifty scenes cut  from the movie, and those radio ads.  Good value for the price.",968803200,,1745,4.583061889250814

Not so with the Life of Brian.  The crew manages to spoof biblical epics (though, contrary to what some  protestors would have one believe then, not the real Christ) brilliantly.  Dialogue is satire at its best, and the final song (given the setting)  could lead one to uncontrollable laughter. A guilty pleasure that I'll  admit is highly enjoyable!",967680000,,539,5.068181818181818
3480787,5,B001B2U1AA,"The Life of Brian was, and continues to be, as very controversial picture.  At the time of its release, it was met with incredible resistance from  Jewish and Christian religious groups.  The Monty Python troupe maintained  that the film was not ""blasphemous"", for it does not make fun of Christ  himself (in the commentaries, several Pythons contend that Christ's  teachings were all in all very sensible, and therefore impossible to  lampoon), but is ""heretical"", as it mocks his followers and organized  churches in general.  Religion has, after all, led to centuries of  bloodshed in the name of God.  There's no doubt that the film IS offensive  to different groups, as it also lampoons leftist political groups, speech  impediments, Roman customs, etc, as well as churches.
As a Christian  myself, I admit to two things (i) There are things that I find offensive  and uncomfortable in this film, and (ii) it is brilliantly funny.  It  should not be strange to discover that many Christians are fans of this  film - after all, who better to appreciate and understand the Biblical  references and the historical setting than ones who have studied it?  Ironically the film's most controversial segment, where Brian's follows  start proclaiming him as Messiah and follow him, is also the weakest,  comedically, after a very funny first half.  Unlike, the Holy Grail, the  Life of Brian is not able to sustain the momentum from beginning to end.  This is in fact characteristic of the Pythons, as even most of their  half-hour shows range from brilliant to rambling incoherency and  repetition.  However, it is the moments of brilliance in Life of Brian (the  People's Front of Judea, Brian's birth, the Centurion and Pontius Pilate,  and the wonderful set dressing) that make it a comedy classic.
The DVD  from Criterion is absolutely first-rate.  This disc is worth the price they  charge, because it takes full advantage of the medium.  The lost scenes are  a gem, as they have not been seen for 20 years - though it's easy to see  why most of them were left on the cutting room floor.  The two audio  commentaries are also excellent.  The Pythons pull no punches -  particularly when talking about each other.  The documentary, filmed during  the making of the film, is also quite good.  All in all, there are more  than 5 solid hours of entertainment on the DVD.  The print itself is  beautiful, and you'll have a new appreciation of the production values that  went into it's making.
All in all, I will maintain my position that Holy  Grail is a better film, but when it comes to DVD releases, until Criterion  produces a Holy Grail version, this DVD is the one to own (or you can be  like me and get both).",966556800,,2714,4.780911062906725

3480789,5,B001B2U1AA,"The finest Monty Python film, and one of the finest comedies ever, 'Brian' was extremely unpopular with people who had not seen it. It's not really  blasphemous, of course - although Jesus appears briefly, he is not the  target of mockery. Rather, the film satirises those who follow religion  blindly, without thinking, as well as poking fun at the attitudes of the  time. More than that, it often just a funny film. Although the Pythons, as  a team, tended to generate sprawling, episodic narratives, 'Brian' is as  tightly-plotted as the average 'Fawlty Towers' episode, with a strong  dramatic thread, and whilst almost everybody is a charicature, Brian  himself comes across as a believable, sympathetic character. As with 'Holy  Grail' a rare attention to detail, conjures a vision of the ancient Middle  East that seems as valid as any 'proper' historical blockbuster. Poor  Brian's eventual fate, abandoned by one and all to die on a cross, is as  emotional as Monty Python ever got. It hasn't dated at all.
The Criterion  people know how to do DVD properly (they started off with laserdiscs, in  particular their acclaimed collector's edition of 'BladeRunner'). Not only  is there amusing commentary from all the surving Pythons, there are  documentaries, trailers, and radio spots. Best of all, there are some of  the extra bits that were cut from the film for time reasons (the original  cut was two and a quarter hours long) - most notably an extended sequence  with the bizarre Jewish / Nazi 'Judean People's Crack Suicide Squad'.

I saw it when it hit theatres, despite picket lines.  The  pope of the time pronounced it ""Blasphemy"".  I'd like to send a  little grateful prayer to his late holiness for helping the film more than  any other advertising could have ever done.  If he had taken the time to  actually WATCH it - he would have seen (as the Pythons say often in the  intoxicating commentaries in the DVD version) that it was HERESY - not  blasphemy.
It lampooned the Church, and hyper-zealous ditto-heads that  equate THEIR own flavor of church with God.  ""I'm NOT the Messiah -  HONESTLY!""...""I say you are, my lord, and I should know!  I've  followed a few!""
THE most believable and respectful portrayal of  Jesus of Nazareth is in this film!  He looks Jewish - for the first time in  a film i ever saw!  And when people at the outside reaches of the Sermon on  the Mount instantly misinterpreted His Beatitudes that just sums up 98% of  the religious grandstanders, coat-tail-riders, and wannabes!  ""Blessed  are the CHEESE makers?""  ""It's not meant to be taken literally,  it refers to all manufacturers of dairy products!""

Besides.  It takes equal oportunity  fatal stabs at politics!  Listen to Reg, the leader of the PFJ!  (or is it  JPF?)  As you do, sure thoughts of devisive religious groups (sorry  Southern Baptists) ARE inevitable... but i counsel that you look at the  political and historical aspect as well!
This is my favorite film.  Of  all.  End o'story.

Monty Python has done a fantastic amount of research into Jewish history and the birth of Christianity to make a total mockery of the hypocrisy found in people who  claim to practice these religions.  As a deeply spiritual man, I found this  film completely unoffensive.  This film doesn't poke fun at those who are a  part of their religion because of an informed, knowledgeable decision, but  rather at those who believe what they believe despite all evidence to the  contrary and can't offer any valid explanation for it.  Most people have  probably been embarassed by people of that sort even in there own religion.  Anybody who thinks that Monty Python's sense of humor is stupid isn't  smart enough to understand the vast amount of research they must have done  to turn verifiable history into such a ridiculous commentary on unchanging  human behaviour.  From the political issue made out of Stan's irrational  desire to be a woman so he could have babys (You haven't got a womb.  Where's the fetus going to gestate?  You gonna put it in a box?) to the  embarrasing meeting where the PFJ finds out that maybe the Romans aren't so  bad (Okay, they did provide the roads, the aqueduct, public sanitation,  education, the wine, etc.) to Pontius Pilate's speech impedement (Who do  you want weleased?  And no more Wudolph the Wed-nosed Weindeer.) followed  by his best friend's linguistic problems (Thampthon of Thithily the  Thaduthee thtrangler wanted for theveral theditious crimeth) to the finale  of optomistics on crosses singing ""Always look on the bright side of  life.""  If you don't get this epic joke and at least appreciate some  of what they deleted to keep the plot tight (DVD--Criterion Edition only) I  feel sorry for you.  But I'm not your judge.  Review this film for  yourself.",958262400,,1842,4.857605177993528
3480798,4,B001B2U1AA,"This movie was really quite funny, but it had some slow spots (maybe because I'm not from England and am not a diehard Monty Python fan). My friends and I rented it and watched it while coloring eggs for a laugh Holy  Saturday. It's not nearly as offensive as I thought it would be, at least  not by today's standards.

3480800,5,B001B2U1AA,"This is the first DVD I purchased for my new DVD player, and I watched it this weekend for the first time.  I'd read all the reviews here and figured I'd like it, since I like humor and have always adored John Cleese.  Before  I got my DVD, I tried to rent it at the video store, but they didn't have  it (they did, however, have a lot of other MP videos).  So that spurred me  to purchase the DVD, and I'm glad it did.  The picture was very clear.  I  know I'll have to watch it again because I missed a lot.  I loved the  ""Biggus Dickus"" scene, and the Roman grammar lesson, and the  stoning scene was hilarious.  I would recommend this film to anyone with a  sense of humor.  The humor is timeless, and now I adore the rest of the  Monty crew (John's still my fave!).",957744000,,770,4.033333333333333
3480801,5,B001B2U1AA,"Haha, had you fooled huh.  Well this is perhaps one of the funniest of the Python series and Eric Idel is always hillarious when he sings.  John Cleese's latin lessons to Brian were a riot.
As always the Python  series looks at some issues and attacks them with their quick wit and  parodys.  In this episode the obvious object of their critisims are those  who blindly follow ""religious leaders"" while placing the  background for the film in Roman occupied Jeruselam.  The story follows the  life of Brian, a young man who at birth was mistaken for the Messiah by the  three wise men to his crucifixtion and Idel's ""Look on the Bright  Side"" song.  This is a must have for any fan of the Python series or  for someone who just wants a funny movie that is a break from the regular  slapstick comedy of today.",957052800,,808,4.445205479452055

3480803,5,B001B2U1AA,"To put it simple, this is one of THE funniest comedies ever made, and following the old Python tradition, it makes fun of everyone and anything. Also, if you didn't know it, this is the Python movie that also contains  Eric Idle's now classic song, ""Always Look on the Bright Side of  Life"".
I recommend you get the Criterion collection if you're going  to purchase this DVD. I got it today, and it has tons of extra features,  plus it is a high-quality-transfer widescreen (I don't think the standard  DVD is widescreen, but I won't bet money on it).
I haven't had time to  hear the TWO, yes two, additional sets of audio tracks, with commentary  from all of the five Pythons (sadly excluding Graham Chapman, for obvious  reasons), but I can only imagine that they alone are worth the extra bucks  you spend on getting the Criterion edition.

3480812,3,B001B2U1AA,"The film is an undeniable classic and the commentaries, deleted scenes and 50 minute documentary on the Criterion version are very good.  However, the negative used to transfer this film to DVD is scratchy and the DVD really  suffers from it.  Lines (some of them really bad) are evident in most  brightly lit scenes and the sky in the opening of the movie is riddled with  imperfections.  This is probably the best print available and Terry Jones,  the Director, has approved the transfer but compared to every other DVD  I've bought this one is a big visual disappointment and is certainly not  'beautiful' as Criterion would have you believe.
Also, the BBC recently  conducted a Monty Python night and there were interviews etc. with the  Python's that could have been licensed for this disc.  This certainly isn't  a 'definitive' version and if you've got it on VHS then buy it for the  extra's alone... a great film, but why use such a bad print?",948844800,,951,4.719512195121951

It is of a higher grade than the cruder ""Holy Grail""  (but that's because George Harrison dumped a ton of money in their laps for this one), and it is a brilliant commentary on the  way people sometimes blindly follow religion. Brian's life is parallel to  that of Jesus, and he is even mistaken for the Messiah, although he keeps  telling people that he is not. There's even a mass crucifixion scene at the  end of the film. Some people may find that offensive, but I find it  incredibly hilarious.  The best part of the film is the stoning scene at  the beginning.  I just keep rewinding it and repeating the dialogue. It is  a very funny watch. If you see the movie and watch everything within the  context of the film, then you will find it funny.  If you are the type to  get offended at anything that mentions ""God"" in it, then you're  better off with ""Holy Grail.""",947116800,,896,4.384146341463414

It will take at least 5 viewings of the  movie to get all the one liners, due to the fact that you will be laughing  so loud that you will miss the next line.

I am basing this on the  standard DVD, I have not seen the Criterion edition.  I read EVERY review  and found they are all given 5 stars based on the movie alone (which  deserves it). But what about presentation?  The Criterion reviews were  obvious as they stated that there is commentary.
