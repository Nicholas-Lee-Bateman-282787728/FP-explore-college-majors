7991566,5,B00009MEGF,I am happy to have this DVD in my collection. Dorothy Dandridge is not given the credit she deserves for her films and acting ability.,1410307200,,134,4.4
7991567,4,B00009MEGF,"This was a good DVD, albeit too short to cover all of the interesting details of Dorothy's short life. It is a good DVD if one seeks an introductory DVD that covers the main points/events. I recently viewed the movie ""Island in the Sun"" and although Dorothy was not billed as a lead star, the DVD contains a feature called ""Little Girl Lost"" dedicated to the life of Dorothy herself. In my opinion, although it was a feature of another movie, it surprisingly had more provocative information that this DVD. It featured interviews with more people in Dorothy's circle (including Harold Nicholas, Dianne Carroll and her sister in law). It went into further details about her relationships and early hardships in Hollywood (it has a segment chronicling and event in which she was attacked in Hedda Hopper's gossip column for dancing with acting classmate/friend Anthony Quinn at a party) and showed more rare footage of her early career. For someone who has an interest, I would suggest purchasing the DVD ""Island in the Sun"" for this feature alone.",1291075200,6,1046,4.882022471910112

7991569,4,B00009MEGF,"I bought this DVD sometime ago, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I became very interested in the life of Dorothy Dandridge after the Halle Berry film, which was a fantastic and well-made film.  Also the well-researched biography by Donald Bogle also influenced me to find whatever media I could to further understand and explore the factors that undermined and ultimately helped to destroy this gifted, talented, tormented and beautiful actress.  This documentary was excellent.  It gave great insight into Ms. Dandridge's life.  Also Obba Babatunde who helped to produe and direct this documentary was also featured in Ms. Berry's film, in which he gave a fantastic performance.  I strongly and heartily recommend to anyone interested in the history of black actors in Hollywood.",1254614400,2,776,5.276422764227642
7991570,5,B00009MEGF,"I love this movie!  Halle Berry was the perfect person to play this role.  Dorothy Dandridge made one too many wrong decisions in her life, but she will always be an icon and a very courageous, talented and sexy black woman for breaking barriers in the world of Hollywood.",1216252800,,272,4.530612244897959
7991571,4,B00009MEGF,"If you can appreciate and love Dorothy Dandridge for the icon she is, you will definitely love this product. It is a well put together biography with many important people featured in it to vouch for my review. Her beauty, pain, and success are all captured in 60 mins. of this pure entertaining saga. ENJOY!",1190937600,4,308,4.618181818181818
7991572,5,B00009MEGF,"This is a wonderful dvd to add to your collection. It's basically a 1 hr documentary on the life and career of the 1st African American woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress. If you have an attention span comprable to a fish, don't buy it, but if you're genuinely interested in learning about an exeptional trailblazer (in her own right), this is the dvd to purchase. Respect is finally being rightfully given to this amazing woman, and she definitely deserved it.",1083283200,31,478,4.635294117647059
