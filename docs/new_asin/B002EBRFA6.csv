8367467,4,B002EBRFA6,"If what you seek in film-watching is something smart, thrilling and different, so beyond the usual fare, this will likely hit the spot. A German movie that, despite a middling budget and unknown actors, provides a fine treatment of an intriguing theme--the impassable horizons of human knowing--through a refreshingly unusual plot.

It involves a couple and their teen daughter trying to remain unnoticed while on the lam, deep in a life of roving criminality. The intrigue is about the bubble they must stay within to avoid detection, and the false picture they must portray to outsiders from Portugal to Germany while keeping their cool when, following one or two contretemps, their situation turns increasingly desperate.

Their 15-year-old (played with quiet brilliance by Julia Hummer) wants a friend, a life, or some love--even of the noisy kind her parents seem to have in adjacent rooms. After all, while she nears despair about having led her whole life in near-seclusion, what goes on there seems to give them pause or maybe delight, or at least relief from the skulking and solitude that weighs so heavily on them all.

It especially weighs on her, now that she's reached pubescence. This is where their problems begin. A boyfriend emerges, it's not quite clear from where, but she can only give him lies about who she is, where she lives, and what she and her parents do. This mirrors, precisely, the only partial grasp we, the viewers, have of why the family lives as they do, what happened to thwart their scheme to flee to new lives in Sao Paulo, why they seem caught without alternatives, where an old ally who shows up fits, and where they may all end up.

Among the puzzles to piece together, we occasionally see snatches of black-and-white CCTV, very likely of police inching closer to them. They never really enter the story-line, so these grainier segments of the movie are intriguing, and add another layer in what ultimately must for everyone remain unclear.

Meantime, the family is scammed by another group of criminals, who rob their apartment and valuables. An effort is made to restore previously obtained loot, and an old outlaw-partner schemes to help them out of their bind. Meantime, informants may be conniving against them, dogged police work hounds them, and perhaps some betrayal is afoot. Still, the multi-layered theme of everyone's incomplete vision, including what transpires in the end, is executed seamlessly and adroitly interwoven into the film.

Directed by Christian Petzold, someone to watch for, this brilliant little movie is well worth catching, and likely to haunt for days afterward.

8367468,4,B002EBRFA6,"""The State I Am In"" (2000 release from Germany; 106 min.; re-released in 2009; original title ""Die innere Sicherheit"", or ""The Inner Certainty"") brings the story of a couple and Jeanne, their 15 yr. old daughter. As the movie opens, we get to know them in Portugal, where as it turns out they are hiding, on the run from the law back in Germany. Jeanne makes the acquaintance of a boy she likes, much to the worry of her parents. Then one day, their apartment is robbed, and in the aftermath, the family goes on the run again, this time back to Germany as they are almost out of money and have nowhere else to go. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is written and directed by Christian Petzold, one of the premier movie directors from Europe in the last 15 years. Just a few years ago, he brought us that other excellent political and psychological drama ""Barbara"". Second, the tension in the movie is palpable from the get-go and it stays that way throughout the movie. Third, while the name is never mentioned in the movie, the director and others comment (n the DVD bonus materials) that the couple's past, never explained in the movie, relates to the Rote Armee Fraction (RAF), the terrorist group which violently fought again the (then West) German state in the 70s and early 80s. Fourth, the main character in the movie is the 15 yr. old girl, who has been tagging along with her parents her entire life, and now she is at the awkward stage where she is interested in boys and in leading a normal, both of which as seemingly impossible to attain. Julia Hummer as Jeanne is a true revelation, just outstanding.

Bottom line, ""The State I Am In"" is a top-notch psychological and family drama with some serious political undercurrents as well. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. If only Hollywood took a clue from this and similar releases that you don't need to blow up the world into smithereens every five minutes to make a compelling, riveting movie. ""The State I Am In"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394409600,12,2138,4.565104166666667
