7864386,5,630407154X,"Well I honestly don't know too much about Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage but it was still enjoyable to watch. A boy named Henry Fleming (played by Wishbone) decides to join the union army during the American Civil War. While in battle Henry is frightened and leaves his fellow soldiers behind. Also in this episode, Joe learns a similar message when three high school kids want Joe to tag along. Joe begins leaving David and Samantha behind to hang out with his new friends.

While yet this episode is not one of my favorites, it's still worth getting.",1251158400,,562,4.62

7864389,5,630407154X,"My kids absolutely loved Wishbone when they were between the ages of 4 and 10 and while this Wishbone ""tale"" did not end up being one of their favorites, they stilled really enjoyed it. It is also interesting to see the two different story lines woven together between the classic stories and ""real life."" Seeing the how it's done at the end is fun too.

In this Wishbone video, Wishbone's boy, Joe, gets caught up hanging out with a group of older friends and neglects his current friends and his dog. Weaving throughout, we see Wishbone in the Red Badge of Courage. As in every Wishbone story, it has a nice moral at the end.

The only disappointment we have now is that we've switched to DVDs now. I guess we'll just have to buy this in a new format!",1125878400,,753,4.371428571428571
7864390,4,630407154X,"In ""The Terrified Terrier"" there is a test of the character of Joe Talbot (Jordan Wall) when he starts hanging out with the high school basketball star and other older, more popular kids.  Will he forget about Samantha (Christie Abbott) and David (Adam Springfield)?  Not if Wishbone (voice of Larry Brantley) has anything to say about it.  This time around the world's most literate Jack Russell Terrier draws his inspiration from Stephen Crane's ""The Red Badge of Courage,"" where Henry Fleming faces a similar test of his character on a battlefield during the American Civil War.  Wishbone gets to play Henry and while the parallel between Henry fleeing run the battlefield and Joe being relegated to a gofer is a bit strained, you have to admire the use of great literature to serve as the moral for the story.  For teachers interested in using this video as a teaching aid in class, there are even lesson plans for ""Terrified Terrier"" in the T-Bone section of the Wishbone web site.  But I think it is possible to take a more direct route with students for them to be interested in reading Crane's novel.  The question of what would YOU do the first time you were on a battlefield is not that much of a stretch for most kids.",1007683200,10,1229,4.635944700460829
