2175144,4,B000683DJQ,"William Shakespeare's tale of the intense and tragic romance of Antony and Cleopatra with its historical, panoramic background would seem ideal for cinema. And indeed, director and star Charlton Heston (who had played Antony two years earlier in an unsuccessful film adaptation of JULIUS CAESAR) has created a rich looking film that belies its modest budget. More importantly, it is not a static ""Old Vic"" reproduction but a vibrant cinematic experience that still manages to retain its Shakespearean authority. Heston concocts all kinds of clever visual conceits, like Proculeius' (Julian Glover) entry into Cleopatra's monument, that were not in Shakespeare's text but add a cinematic touch to the proceedings. The film's modest budget precludes any detailed battle scenes which seem quickly telegraphed but other than that, one doesn't feel cheated. While Heston makes for a commanding and robust Antony, the film suffers somewhat from the anemic Cleopatra of Hildegard Neil (A TOUCH OF CLASS) while the actress who could have made an imposing Cleopatra, Jane Lapotaire, plays the handmaiden Charmian. There's a sumptuous score by John Scott that positively shimmers and the accomplished cinematography by Rafael Pacheco . With Fernando Rey, John Castle, Freddie Jones, Carmen Sevilla and Eric Porter.

The Warners DVD is a nicely rendered anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer. The audio could have been punched up a bit though as John Scott's lovely score often seems muted.",1319673600,3,1480,5.434782608695652
2175145,5,B000683DJQ,"If  you are a Charlton Heston fan, this is a must.  It was released only 1 week in the U.S. Limited VHS and never on DVD until now, thanks to his son's company buying the rights.  Yes, it is Shakespeare, but overall a good film (some weaknesses in performance)",1319241600,2,260,4.26530612244898
2175146,3,B000683DJQ,"This is one of those films that should have been greater that it was. And now happened that Warner Video cut an entire scene out of this edition, specifically the part when Mark Antony has to return to Rome and has to find the words and courage to leave Cleopatra, who tries to get him to stay in Egypt. This is a terrible deed! I cannot believe that they cut a movie secquence just to make space for the documentary feature by Fraser Heston (?) especially since this is a dual layer disc, while the VHS edition featured the complete, uncut movie.
Even Mr. Charlton Heston would have objected to that. I would have appreciated to know this before buying this DVD, but now you know it. Therefore I took one star off the rating.

Besides this, the DVD features no Scene Selection on the menu, and subtittles are limited to English and French. Therefore I took a second star off the rating.

Now the positive points are that the DVD transfer is crisp and trufhful, well made. The movie plays smoothly and beautifully and the audio is definitely better that in the VHS edition.",1310342400,96,1073,4.4974358974358974
2175147,2,B000683DJQ,"First I must set the record straight: this is not the uncut version. On the cover of the DVD it is written 148 minutes, but the original was 2 hours and 42 minutes long - that is what Heston said on television then in 1972 in Japan. So, about 14 minutes short. Missing are as follows as far as I can remember clearly (I saw it 5 times then, being a great Heston fan):

Act I, sc i: Cleopatra's lines from ""Nay, hear them, Antony"" to ""The messengers!"" The perceptive viewers must have noticed that Antony was suddenly wearing a pearl necklace when he says ""Let Rome in Tiber melt, ..."" which was not there seconds earlier. It was wound by Cleopatra while speaking those lines.
Act I, sc iii, the leave-taking scene with Cleopatra (quite a big chunk)
Act I, sc v, Alexas's appearance ""Sovereign of Egypt, hail!"" etc.
Prelude to part 2 (I never heard this, but it is on the soundtrack album: 1 min 31 sec.)
Whoever was responsible for that, one must have thought nobody would notice but there are some still around who saw the film when the it was first released and even remember it well.

14 minutes may not sound much but the cut is devastating for the Cleopatra character, making her utterly uninteresting, particularly at her first appearance, and it makes the first one-thirds of the film so dull. One wonders why Antony didn't stick with Octavia and retain half the Roman world. Poor Hildegarde Neil whose better scenes were so callously cut! Surely it would take a greater actress than Neil to play this part convincingly. Heston himself was not terribly happy with her even while shooting but she was the ""best girl available"" to him (or affordable, perhaps). However, even though ""the critics' wrath"" was ""concentrated on her"", he did not think she was so bad. (From his journals, ""Actor's life"" 1978.)

Of course I've read all the plays of Shakespeare at least two times and some many times over including this one. The problem with me is that I don't much like it  - particularly the portrayal of Cleopatra. I cannot imagine her to be the queen of one of the richest country of the ancient world, but merely a crafty woman in the art of love, and in the end what induced her to die was more the prospect of shame than the bereavement by Antony. Surely one cannot blame her or Shakespeare for that. Besides, the art of love was what she exercised as statecraft since the time with Julius Caesar. However, this is no place to discuss that. To be honest I prefer Mankiewicz's Cleopatra to Shakespeare's!

I thought this film would never come out on DVD, but it did after a long wait: 39 years since when I saw it in the local cinema. What a shame that it came out in such a poor presentation! The cut is unpardonable and but more disappointing is the sound: so much tape noise as one seldom hears on DVDs, certainly never from major studios. My ancient soundtrack album sounds much better, and in stereo as well.
Otherwise the film is better than I remembered. I was rather surprised that those lines could be spoken naturally. I thought then that Heston overplayed a bit, but now I see that he rather underplayed. The problem at least for me is that he is hardly convincing as Antony the Drunkard and Antony the Debauchee, although normally credible as a leader of men; in this case a blundering general finally deserted by his men. I leave the praise for the supporting players like Eric Porter, John Castle, etc. to other reviewers.  It is ironic and sad that this should be released on the same day as the latest edition of The Ten Commandments that has received the maximum treatment. I would have gladly waited more for a better really uncut one in Blu-ray.

I would give 4 stars to this film were it not for the unpardonable cut.",1305936000,45,3742,4.518463810930576
2175148,3,B000683DJQ,"This restoration is Fraser Heston's homage to his father.

In his autobiography, ""In the Arena"", Charlton Heston tells how, at the end of filming ""Ben-Hur"", the director, William Wyler, said: ""Well Chuck, I guess that just about wraps the picture.  Next time I'll try to get you a better part.""  But there was no better part.  From ""El Cid"" to ""Earthquake"" it was downhill all the way.  Interspersed with these subsequent movies the film star returned to the stage for short-run, much less financially rewarding but more personally satisfying, theatre productions.  ""Antony and Cleopatra"" shows Charlton Heston as he imagined himself as a great Shakespearian actor.

Apparently, in order to attract financing, the film had to have something of an ""epic"" quality about it.  This was done by using film clips from ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Cleopatra"".

The sea-battle at Actium intercuts images from ""Ben-Hur"" (where Quintus Arrius attacks the Macedonian pirates); ""Cleopatra"" (for its Battle of Actium); and a studio mock-up (in order to put Charlton Heston in the frame).  The contrast between ""Ben-Hur""'s model ships filmed in a studio tank with a stormy sky and ""Cleopatra""'s lumbering hulks filmed off Ischia under a clear summer sky is most jarring.

The final land battle intercuts images from ""Cleopatra"" and second unit photography by Joe Canutt filmed on the beaches at Almera in Spain.  The second unit extras are costumed in some sort of proto-Saracen gear.  (Perhaps Hollywood's idea of how 30 BC Egyptians might have dressed.)

There are a couple of locational shots with ships at sea in the background which must be some of the worst matte filming ever produced.

The shots of Cleopatra's palace (both exterior and interior) are no match for those seen in ""Cleopatra"" or even those of many a sword and sandal epic.  Cleopatra's tomb is a little cardboard-like pyramid sitting in the desert (of Almera) with its avenue of sphinxes.  (There are no other pyramids in this film.)

The film negative was shot in Todd-AO 35.  The DVD is presented in the film's original 2.35:1 film aspect (with black strips above and below).  The transfer of the studio shots to DVD is excellent (but less so the film clips).  The close-ups are clear enough to show that most of the actors were in need of some orthodontic work.

All of the actors, apparently at Heston's insistence, were Shakespearean trained theatre actors.  In his autobiography Heston recalled a fellow actor commenting that in order to do a great ""Antony and Cleopatra"" you've got to have a really great Cleopatra.  Heston did not heap praises on Hildegarde Neil's performance.

All-in-all the film would have been much better if there had been more Shakespearian dialogue and fewer action scenes.",1302652800,12,2749,5.042128603104213
2175149,4,B000683DJQ,"i've always been curious about this film, not on account of charlton heston, but for john castle, one of those actors who seem unable to give a poor performance and of whom i've been an admirer since the 1970's.  and he's terrific here, really young and with dyed blonde hair, but still and quiet and commanding as always. it's an ambitious film and you must give heston credit for making a very earnest attempt at telling the story, and he's not at all bad as antony, quite imposing really---i recently saw ""the fall of the roman empire"" which was intended for him and sophia loren, but he passed on it, and he is really what's missing from that excellant film, a great big star at it's center. too bad he didn't have it's budget for ""antony and cleopatra"".  and a word too about the great eric porter (who was also in ""fall of the roman empire"", now i come to think about it!)  what a pleasure to be in the hands of so skilled an actor, never a false moment, so commanding even when he isn't speaking, when he's holding heston's helmet and just listening. he and john castle make this film worth owning.",1302307200,5,1105,4.4068627450980395
2175150,5,B000683DJQ,"Barely seen since it opened in 1972, Charlton Heston's Antony and Cleopatra is one of the handsomest and most vividly cinematic Shakespeare adaptations - this is first and foremost a film, and one whose epic scale often belies its surprisingly modest budget with judicious use of leftover sets from 50s and 60s epics, some well chosen Spanish locations, a bit of stock footage from Fox's Cleopatra and an impressive supporting cast. If anything the supporting cast are almost too impressive, often showing up actor-director Heston's weaknesses with the Bard's verse. While his co-stars generally favor a more naturalistic style, at times Heston goes for the kind of declamatory style that values the sound of the words rather than the meaning, a common pitfall with Shakespeare films. In his favor, Heston has the epic stature and presence to convince as a superstar of the ancient world whose fool for love act is revealing feet of clay that at first dismays and then sets his fans against him with fatal consequences, and his performance improves as he uses it against himself to expose the character's increasingly obvious flaws.

A labor of love for Heston (who apparently included use of stock footage from Cleopatra in his deal to make Beneath the Planet of the Apes), there's some real imagination in the staging - he sets Antony and Octavian's first meeting against a gladiatorial combat, while the aftermath of the battle of Actium is played out amid the wreckage on the beach - and great visuals - Heston really understands the scale of the story and the value of real locations as well as the occasional need for the kind of movement and energy that's so often missing from Shakespeare films. Not everything works (there's some flashcut inserts in a couple of scenes that are probably better as ideas than in execution), and it does tend to drag a bit in the last third, but then so does the play, yet there's more than enough here to mark Heston out as a more intelligent and imaginative director than he was ever given credit for.

It's also surprisingly well cast. Despite attracting much critical derision, Hildegard Neil is a convincingly mercurial Cleopatra, John Castle makes his Octavian equally disappointed and ruthless and there's strong support from Julian Glover, Douglas Wilmer, Jane Lapotoire, Peter Arne, Roger Delgado, John Hallam, Joe Melia and Fernando Rey (surprisingly well dubbed by Richard Johnson, who also dubs Aldo Sambrell and Juan Luis Galiardo). Even serial overactor Freddie Jones is kept under control for once as Pompey. But the film's outstanding performance is easily Eric Porter's Enobarbus, easily the finest Shakespeare performance I've ever seen on screen, managing at once to bring the verse to life without ever losing sight of the human being beneath it: his rapturous ode to ""the barge she sat in"" paints a far more spectacular and magical picture in the mind than anything in Joseph Mankiewicz's 1963 epic (though some of the footage from the Battle of Actium does turn up in the battle scenes). Equally worthy of star billing is John Scott's remarkable score, one of the best and most sadly overlooked of the 70s, and a thing of real beauty in its own way too. Given a rough ride by critics in its day and now extremely hard to find (before Warner's uncut release there was only a cut Spanish DVD, an even worse German one and a surprisingly good uncut - minus the overture - widescreen transfer that was given away with a Greek newspaper and which could be found on ebay), it's well worth a look.",1301270400,12,3552,4.879139072847682
2175151,4,B000683DJQ,"Charlton Heston directed and starred in this production of Shakespeare's *Antony and Cleopatra*. Filmed in England in 1972, it seems to have been influenced by Franco Zefferelli's 1968 version of *Romeo and Juliet* in which nudity was introduced into film adaptations of the bard's plays.

English teachers who may wish to show this movie in class should preview the film and make their own decisions about whether to employ the famous ""hold-a-folder-in-front-of-the-screen"" technique as Heston did find a way to introduce a bit of skin, creating a scene on Cleopatra's barge where her ladies-in-waiting go in for some eye-popping sunbathing in front of the eunuch who protects them.

J. Arthur Rank (1888-1972), the British founder of the Rank Group, PLC, which made the movie, got into the filmmaking industry in the 1930s in an effort to bring family-friendly films to the British filmgoing audience to counter-balance what he considered the risque direction American films were taking. Knowing that, one wonders if the sincere Methodist, who would have been 84 and in the last days of his life when this film was in production, would have jumped so blithely onto the Zefferelli bandwagon had he still had a hand in what his company was doing.

Still, the delivery of the Shakespearean dialogue is masterful, which is an important consideration for the literature classroom. My main disappointment was that Heston's Antony seemed wooden and hardly the slobbering fool that ""piece of work,"" Cleopatra, led around by the nose. Thus, Heston lost a key element in Shakespeare's history plays: how human folly can bring down even the greatest of the world's powers.

Since this movie was made in England, it is hard to find in a VHS format that will play in Region 1. It has not yet been released in DVD format, and since Charlton Heston himself considered this film a flop, it may be a long time before someone takes the risk of doing so. Bottom line: snap up a VHS copy and make your own decisions about classroom use.",1278115200,16,2018,4.943952802359882
2175152,5,B000683DJQ,"Charlton Heston's production is an excellent adaptation.  It is not a filmed play, but a movie.  Every character, from the leads to the most minor, is well played.  As director, even working on a shoestring budget, Heston managed to get in the spectacular action that a stage production can only suggest.  As lead actor, he presented an Antony whose strength and weakness made him very human.

  Some of Shakespeare's lines were cut, some moved around, and some ""translated"" into more modern English, i.e. ""wanton"" for ""riggish"".  Offended purists should remember that Shakespeare was a working playwright,turning out scripts that put groundling feet on the ground and aristocratic rears on seats.  Because he was a poetic genius, what he wrote turned out to be great literature, but it is better performed than read.

  Heston's movie never went into general theatrical release in this country because the critics killed it.  They were wrong.",1113091200,56,943,5.1655629139072845

2175168,2,B000683DJQ,"The first time I read ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA I was amazed by its incandescent language, and years of re-reading have not dulled the effect of Shakespeare's achievement. It will never replace ROMEO AND JULIET in the popular imagination, but that's OK. The earlier play is a paen to romantic love and all of its wonder. You willingly surrender to it. This later play is more mature, much less romantic, brutally honest, and one of the greatest expressions  of the art of poetry in any venue. I so wanted to enjoy this version! After seeing Charlton Heston's wonderful cameo as the Player King in Brannagh's HAMLET, I was primed to see this classically trained actor perform brillianty. Well, I'd say it's a 50/50 performance. Some moments are just fine, others are uninspired. And the bloated settings don't help. We don't need real horses, real soldiers, real fires, real mayhem, etc. Shakespeare's genius is THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, the only special effect required and in this play, as I said above, the language was inspired by the Muse of Fire. Both lovers sting our senses and stun our minds with their speeches. Anything that detracts from that focus, any lines dropped to show a battle scene or a gladiator contest is just a loss of magic and wonder.

2175186,4,B000683DJQ,"""Antony and Cleopatra"" is a movie for Shakespeare lovers by Shakespeare lovers.  Let's face it, after 400 years Shakespeare offers little in thrills and suspense.  We seem to know Shakespeare's stories by a sort of cultural osmosis.

This is not to say we can't be surprised and held in suspense by minor Shakespeare works.  I have been held in thrall by ""A Winter's Tale"" and was astounded by its beautiful climax.  The monumental tragedies, however, promise few surprises.  Shakespeare's modern fans watch Shakespeare performed to hear the most beautiful words in the English language enunciated by good speakers.

This, ""Antony and Cleopatra"" has in spades.  The cast is superb.  Julian Glover (""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"");  Freddie Jones;  Eric Porter (Forsyte Saga, Jewel in the Crown); Peter Arne;  and John Castle, who plays Octavius like a more powerful extension of his Geoffrey in ""Lion in the Winter,"" and who is by far preferable to Roddy McDowell in the overblown ""Cleopatra"" of an earlier decade.  These actors know how to do Shakespeare right, inhabiting the roles rather than doing recitation.

Heston is a perfect Antony.  Obsessed with the role all his life, he had recently played a younger Antony in ""Julius Caesar"" -- a movie with a great cast sabotaged by Jason Robards in the worst ever performance by a good actor.

Perhaps learning his lesson from ""Caesar"" Heston made sure he cast no fish-out-of-water types.  The only weak spot in the acting, if any, is Cleopatra herself.  Hildegard Neil is certainly photogenic, and her acting is good.  She reminded me of a kind of English Katherine Hepburn, though slinkier;  able to show for Shakespeare  the facility Hepburn had for Eugene O'Neill.  Her only fault, if it is a fault, is that she lacks the tremendous presence one expects of one of history's most famous women.

For my money, Neil is a lot better than the histrionics of that more infamous English-born Cleopatra, Elizabeth Taylor, who was overrated in both talent and looks.  But Neil does not dominate the screen, so when she acts opposite someone with Charlton Heston's grasp of the screen she tends to get lost.  Whatever one thinks of Taylor and Burton, they did fill a wide screen, especially when it shrinks to home video size.

One problem Heston had with ""Antony and Cleopatra"" was the Taylor/Burton debacle, which would have destroyed 20th Century Fox if not for the surprising success of ""The Sound of Music.""  Elizabeth Taylor made the very word ""Cleopatra"" anathema to movie-makers.  And until the days of Branagh, Shakespeare was always a hard sell.  The chord Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" struck the youth of 1968 might not transfer to the more mature obsessions of Cleo and Antony in 1972.  The combined words ""Cleopatra"" and ""Shakespeare"" scared backers away.

And director Heston (possibly because it was what he knew best) wanted to make an epic.  That's the worst problem with the movie, Heston's efforts to make an epic when he lacked an epic bankroll.  Shooting it in the desert helped greatly, since all he needed was sand.  But this was Heston's entry-level position as director, and to make an epic one has to have a born eye for it.  David Lean and his cinematographer Freddie Young practically made the desert a character in ""Lawrence of Arabia.""  Heston's desert just lies there.

By 1972, the epic was dying out, anyway.  And Heston faced the same problem that nearly ruined Branagh with ""Hamlet.""  HAMLET is principally a family drama, with two families destroyed by one man's obsessions;  nevertheless, the survival of an entire country rested on Hamlet's decisions.  ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA is even more directly concerned with the contention between two mighty kingdoms, boiled down to a story presentable on a Jacobean stage.

Heston did his best, even managing to swipe footage cut from ""Ben Hur"" to flesh out the battle of Actium.  The movie might have played better on a smaller scale rather than a wide-screen epic but who's to say?  Heston isn't a bad director (how could he be, with this cast?).  But some of the editing is sloppy.  And Heston used less than subtle imagery, such as having Antony talk with Octavius (John Castle) and Lepidus (Fernando Rey), being inter-cut with a LONG fight between gladiators.  Way to hammer home the subtext, Chuck!

Both the opening and closing credit sequences are lousy, but at least at the beginning the red lettering shows up against the sea.  The closing credits were hard to read against the desert.

If you love to hear Shakespeare spoken by good actors, this movie is a keeper.  How can anything with both John Castle and Freddie Jones be otherwise?  If, on the other hand, you want an exciting sand-and-sandal epic, but you don't know much about Shakespeare or about Roman or Egyptian history, you'll likely be bored.

The DVD also has a ""Making of Antony and Cleopatra"" which is only an interview with Fraser Heston, Charlton's son and whose greatest claim to fame is being the infant Moses in ""The Ten Commandments.""",1376006400,2,5046,4.924080664294188
2175187,5,B000683DJQ,"I liked very much this excellent and very powerful adaptation of famous Shakespear's play. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Charlton Heston is, except a mistake on my part, the person who played Mark Antony the most in all history of cinema - indeed, he was cast as this famous Roman warlord and politician no less than three times!

The first time he played him it was in 1950, in the largely forgotten today ""Julius Caesar"" by David Bradley. It was Heston's only second role and even if the film itself was not a big hit, his performance as Mark Antony helped him a lot in launching his career, by landing leading roles in ""Dark City"", ""Savage"", ""Ruby Gentry"" and especially the part in the gigantic Cecil B. DeMille production ""The greatest shown on Earth"".

In 1970 he played Mark Antony in another ""Julius Ceaesar"", this time as part of an ensemble cast, which included also John Gielgud, Jason Robards, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain, Diana Rigg, Christopher Lee and Richard Johnson. His performance was considered as most excellent and it inspired him to try to play this character in another Shakespear's play - ""Antony and Cleopatra"". But this time, he decided to also direct it.

Released in 1972, this film received surprisingly poor reviews and bombed at box-office, as most cinemas withdrew it very fast from the screens. It remained almost impossible to see for 30 years and was all but forgotten. This 2011 DVD release is therefore a sort RESURRECTION - long time overdue in my personal opinion...

This film follows very faithfully Shakespear's script and therefore takes unavoidably some liberties with the real history. It begins with the Second Triumvirate formed (in real history in 42BC) and ends with Octavian total victory in 31BC. However you will not see here nine years passing and a great deal of real events will not be shown, such as Antony's disastrous failure in his campaign against Parths and the birth of Antony and Cleopatra's children (they are not even mentioned). But the real strength of this play is not in history lessons, but in a very powerful, very Shakespearian creation of a ""symphony"" about love, war, intrigue, hubris, betrayal, forgiveness, pride - and death...

Charlton Heston is of course the major star and the main pillar of this film and I found his Mark Antony much BETTER than the much more famous portrayal by Richard Burton. Heston was already 49 when playing in this film and therefore close to the age of real Antony during the period described. Especially towards the end this age issue becomes a very great asset to the film, as real Antony was 53 when he died. Also, the imposing size and stature of Heston fits well with the descriptions of real Antony, who was clearly a physically very powerful man. It is also my impression, that Heston portrayed Antony as a much STRONGER, PROUDER and more FORMIDABLE person than the one shown by Burton (who in ""Cleopatra"" made Antony in a kind of sissy, really...) - and that is a mightily good thing.

Stepping in the shoes of Elizabeth Taylor, Vivien Leigh and Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra was a much more difficult task for Hildegard Neil, a rather little known theatre and TV British actress, who, as of July 2013, is still alive, well and busy, as she keeps playing. Well, she TOTALLY succeeded! Her Cleopatra is different from the one portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor, with especially some quasi-comical accents (in full accordance with Shakespear's original script), but nevertheless she is absolutely IMPRESSIVE, in all her aspects: a cunning politician, a venomous vixen, a girl in love, a proud queen carrying on her shoulders the fate of her country - and finally a woman in deep mourning, defeated but not broken, reading herself for the ultimate voyage... Last but not least, as far as my personal taste is concerned, Hildegarde Neil's Cleopatra is the FAIREST OF THEM ALL, as this actress was in the 70s at her hottest and most gorgeous. Some SF amateurs, especially of more geeky/nerdy kind, will instantly recognize her as the actress playing one of the hottest ""Space 1999"" guest stars, playing drop dead gorgeous and terminally venomous Elizia in the episode ""Devil's planet""...

All the other cast performed also splendidly in this film, but some deserve special mentions:

- John Castle portrays an Octavius Caesar (Octavian), as a kind of a jerk, but more human and less wicked than the one played in Mankiewicz's ""Cleopatra"" by Roddy McDowall
- Eric Porter is a particularly good Enobarbus, a character roughly corresponding to Martin Landau's Rufio in ""Cleopatra""
- Jane Lapotaire (at that time married to director Roland Joffe), who still continues today a succesful career in British TV, is excellent as Charmian, Cleopatra's chief handmaiden and confidante
- Monica Peterson, a gorgeous black beauty who plays Iras, the other Cleopatra's faithful handmaiden (sadly, Ms Peterson interrupted her career soon after)
- Emiliano Redondo, a Spanish actor who plays Mardian, a faithful eunuch, completely (and obviously platonically) in love with his queen...

I think this film, so undeservedly ravaged by critics 30 years ago and for so long hidden from public view, is one of the BEST Shakespear's adaptaions I ever saw and it is an impressive show, very much holding its own when compared to - much more expensive to turn - Mankiewicz's ""Cleopatra"". Charlton Heston particularly proved here, that he was not only a GREAT actor but also that he could direct as well as anybody else in this business. It is such a pity that his first, very succesful attempt in this field, was so poorly received... But at least now, we can admire his work and appreciate fully this EXCELLENT film.

2175195,3,B000683DJQ,"This movie is an excellent rendition of Shakespeare's Antony & Cleopatra and the casting is fabulous.  What limits the movie's achievement is Shakespeare's interpretation of the character of Mark Antony.  Mark Antony was Julius Caesar's 'Master of the Horse', cousin and alter ego.  Could it be that Caesar knew that the Senate was against him and his usurpation of Senatorial privileges and actively decided to send Mark Antony, his trusted lieutenant, to defend the position of Cleopatra and her/his son Caesarion in Egypt against anticipated Roman reaction and reactionaries?

If so, Antony's role was not that of a libertine seeking solely Cleopatra's bed, but the defender of the rights of Caesar's son, Caesarion, to hold hereditary office within the Roman imperial family.  In point of fact, under the 'Donations of Alexandria,' Antony proclaimed Cleopatra ""Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt"", to rule with Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of Cleopatra by Julius Caesar), ""King of Kings and King of Egypt"". By this proclamation, Caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of Caesar, as emperor-in-waiting. If this interpretation is correct, it underscores the biases that get interjected into historical accounts by the entertainment world, even those of the 16th/17th century. It is plain that Antony failed in this quest to preserve Caesarion's role within Pax Romana, but the interesting part of history is not necessarily the outcome of historical events but rather the struggle that shows us what was at stake:  a Rome dominated by the Egyptian/Eastern-educated and raised Caesarion (a more Eastern-focused, provincially-centered empire and perhaps representative of Julius Caesar's original intent to incorporate foreign nobility into the high empire system) or, a Rome dominated by the traditional Roman (Western) ruling classes/aristocracy as exemplified by Octavian.",1354060800,,1887,5.557491289198606

A triumph.",1351900800,,492,5.4868421052631575
2175197,3,B000683DJQ,"This movie adaptation of ""Antony and Cleopatra"" from 1972 is an ego-trip for Charlton Heston, who decided to do the Laurence Olivier thing and write, act *and* direct.  The difference is that Olivier's ego-trips are great films, and this is merely... okay.  The acting from the leads is not that impressive.  Charlton Heston does some great !ACTING! but always reminds the viewer that he is !ACTING! (Jon Lovitz motion) instead of simply being the character (his best actual acting job of all time was in ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" as Cardinal Richelieu with the title role of Ben-Hur coming in a distant second).  Hildegard Neil is good at being back-stabbing and petulant but fails to make Cleopatra a deep, interesting character.  No, all of the *good* acting in this movie comes from the supporting cast, including Julian Glover, John Castle and The Master himself, Roger Delgado, who gives the best performance of all of them.  The other big upside is that this is a lavish, epic production so at least you will see impressive sets and costumes while taking in all of the Shakespearian thesperizing (if The Bard could make up words then so can I).

The sound on this DVD is the worst I have ever heard on any video recording in my entire life - and I used to watch some really skuzzy VHS tapes back in the day.  As other Amazon reviewers here have pointed out, there is a loud hiss present in the whole thing which means that someone didn't go back and clean up the original analog sound source before converting it to digital.  While watching this film you may want to turn on the English subtitles, not necessarily to help with the Elizabethan dialogue (although that may be beneficial depending on how familiar with Shakespeare you are) but to be able to MAKE OUT WHAT THE ACTORS ARE SAYING.  On the plus side the picture is pretty good.  There is also a featurette on the making of the movie which is presented in 4:3.

Overall I give the movie itself 3 out of 5 stars: you may watch this once and somewhat enjoy it (or parts of it) but it's not something you'll return to.  The DVD itself also gets 3 out of 5 stars, with good picture but awful sound and only one bonus feature (no trailers).  This averages out to... 3 stars (I can do math!).  In conclusion this DVD is only necessary for Shakespeare or Heston completests.  For everyone else this is a rental at best.",1350432000,2,2401,4.574766355140187
2175198,5,B000683DJQ,"""Anthony And Cleopatra"" is an absolutely fabulous movie with the flawless talents of Charlton Heston as Marc Anthony in the lead role.

The cast is superb; the locales are breathtaking, the story is indeed magnificent.

Charlton Heston actually directed this film, and his son, Fraser C. Heston, was an Assistant Director for this film.

2175199,3,B000683DJQ,"OFFICIALLY 3.5 STARS. This is another one of those titles that I missed the first time around and that I have waited for years to see. Now that I have finally caught up with it, I'm glad I did. There are no other theatrical releases (as opposed to made for TV versions) of ANTONY & CLEOPATRA out there so it's fortunate that this one is as good as it is. It is not the ideal version by any means but until someone else decides to tackle A & C on the big screen, this one will more than suffice. Charlton Heston began his career by making low budget film versions of classic plays (PEER GYNT, JULIUS CAESAR) in his pre-Hollywood days and had played Marc Antony on two previous occasions so it comes as no surprise that he can handle the Shakespearean dialogue. The only problem from my perspective is that while imposing enough, he just looks too old for the role. The same can be said for Hildegard Neil's Cleopatra. Neil is best known for her stage and Brit TV work and for being in the Glenda Jackson-George Segal vehicle A TOUCH OF CLASS. Both actors seem a little jarring at first but you do get used to them and by the end you realize that they have given performances of substance.

The real strength of the production lies in the supporting cast of British actors, many of them members of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Julian Glover, John Castle, Douglas Wilmer, Peter Arne, and Freddie Jones are familiar faces and voices who add interest and lustre to their roles. The absolute standouts are Eric Porter as Enobarbus who speaks as if he was having an intimate conversation with you which allows his words to really sink in and Jane Lapotaire as Cleopatra's maidservant Charmian who brings grace and humor to her role. In addition to the fine supporting performances, the Spanish locations give a sense of granduer to what is obviously a low budget production by Hollywood standards. Heston's direction is hit and miss with the shadows of Cecil B. De Mille and William Wyler looming large but not enough to sabotage the film. There are even excerpts from BEN HUR and the 1963 CLEOPATRA thrown in to lend scope to the battle scenes and they are skillfully incorporated. In the end ANTONY & CLEOPATRA is not as good as it could have been but it remains a worthwhile undertaking that I'll have no trouble revisiting.",1330128000,5,2322,4.568345323741007

Okay, he is no Sir Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh but he played Mark Anthony pretty well and good performances from the rest of the cast all round.

It has solid theater trained actors, a great music score, and wonderful locations. Where it lacks is in some of its sets and in comparison to the more well known Cleopatra from 10 years earlier.

That movie was extremely expensive in its sets and costumes. This film has great sets and costumes, but also some pretty cheap looking ones. There are some great action sequences, with a naval battle and sword fighting. John Castle is very similar to Roddy McDowall, who played Octavian in the Burton/Taylor epic. Julian Glover gives a stand out performance.

Heston keeps most of the original dialogue from the play, but cuts some scenes and combines others.  It's a rather faithful adaptation of the Shakespeare tragedy.

The only special feature is a 32 minute interview with Fraser Heston discussing the movie in glowing terms. He worked on it as a teenager under the 2nd unit director. The film was made in Spain and the younger Heston knew Spanish and helped translate for the extras, most of whom did not speak English.

8040105,2,B000683DJQ,"Without getting too deep into the historical weeds, this film was a long wished for project by its star who is also the director, screenwriter and former NRA lobbyist, Charlton Heston.  Heston had done Shakespeare on stage including the role of Marc Antony in Caesar and Cleopatra.  He wanted to adapt this Shakespearian play for the big screen but had little financial backing.  Using some of his own money and that of friend and producer, Peter Snell they pulled together less than $2 million and went to Spain to shoot the film.  The budget was so slim, they used outtakes from Ben Hur for the battle at sea sequences between the Roman and Egyptian forces.  Using mostly an unknown European cast and a script that uses a combination of Shakespearian dialog supplemented by words added by Hestonand an uncredited Federico De Urrutia, the film is hard to follow.  It is made even more difficult because of the various English-speaking accents interacting.  Hildegard Neil who is primarily a British TV actress gets the meaty role of Cleopatra but her acting seems forced.  The only other actors Im familiar with are Fernando Rey as Lepidus and Freddie Jones as Pompey.

The story opens after Cleos fling with Julius Caesar is over with his murder in Rome.  Marc Antony, sharing power with Octavius (John Castle) goes to Alexandria to bring Cleopatra back to Rome.  But alas falls for her charms.  We know this as Antonys way of showing affection for his women [Cleo and current wife, Octavia (Carmen Sevilla) who is also Octaviuss sister] by placing his hand squarely on her breast.  There are a couple of back and forth journeys by Antony which certainly adds to the films mind boggling 2  hour running time.  The uncut version adds another 14 minutes.

As near as I can determine the film was never released in the U. S.  I read where it was scheduled to appear on TV but never did.  The film on DVD isn't rated but might even be an R cut as it is.  There is one scene on Cleos barge where a fully naked chick dives into the ocean holding a torch in both hands.  With that scene excised it would probably be PG-13 for a couple bare butts including Heston in a G-string.  Unfortunately this film just isn't any good.
