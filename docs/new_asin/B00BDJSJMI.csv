8566683,5,B00BDJSJMI,"I can't praise this bluray enough. You guys from Justplanes really know what Avgeeks want. Well done.

If I had one complaint though, it'd be this: Other justplanes docunentaries showed the preflight process on multiple flight legs. This one really only showed it once.

All in all, its a nust have.",1384128000,2,299,4.8431372549019605
8566684,3,B00BDJSJMI,"I was excited when I found out that Just Planes was releasing their first video of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.  Having a United Boeing 777 DVD and a Swissair Airbus DVD, I knew what kinds of things to expect in the video.  The other DVD's must have set the bar extremely high because I feel Just Planes just phoned in their first Dreamliner release.

There was a good presentation on the Electronic Flight Book (EFB) and an extremely (IMHO) brief presentation about the differences in a 767/777 and the Dreamliner but I would have expected this film to have much more details in the in-flight presentation segments.  I suppose when the other DVDs have practically a menu-tree by menu-tree explanation of statuses and configuraton options of the Flight computer and practically a switch by switch tour of the center console and overhead controls, just having the detail of just the EFB falls short of my expectations for a in-flight presentation of the most advanced Boeing jet to date.

I feel more maps and routes would have been helpful to this video.  Only one leg had good video of the map of africa and the route being taken and another leg or two had it verbally, but I'm not familiar enough with the places in Africa to understand what the route was without having to constantly pull up google maps to find a map in place of what should have been in the video, either added in post or footage edited in from the in-plane flight route map display.

There was some cabin footage but I would have preferred more considering this cabin is supposed to be more advanced and different than in any airplane before it.  It would have been cool to see technical info and views of the LED interior lighting system and especially if the LED color was fixed or if it could have been switched among several different colors depending on the airline preference.  I would have liked to see a demo of the special shading technology of the large windows in the passenger cabin more than just footage of windows in already varying shades or a flight attendant looking like she was trying to adjust the shading but not showing much difference in the shading of the window.

Best parts of the video was the explanation of why Ethiopian airlines ordered dreamliners, their desire for what they want to do for air travel in Africa, and the external walkthrough of the airplane was definitely up to the quality I expect for that kind of segment in a Just Planes video.

This was still a good video to watch but not up to what I've seen from Just Planes videos in the past.  Coming into this video, I had the thought that African airlines were flying North America and Europe's leftover older planes.  After seeing this video, my thought is changed bigtime and such that that if I were traveling around Africa, I would have no problems flying Ethiopian Airlines because you can see that they are flying a lot of current model planes and their  flight crew usually have decades of flight experience usually over many different plane types and are extremely well trained.",1362268800,,3054,4.641929499072356
8566685,5,B00BDJSJMI,"Not just the first 787 video in the Just Planes arsenal, one of the best videos there as well.  Start with being 4:30 in length, with some filler, but not enough to become boring.  Well spoken captains whose explanations are clear and thorough.  Some excellent scenery, though a lot of cloud cover (it being near the equator and all) sometimes blocks the view of Africa.

While I would have been happier with a larger number of takeoffs and landings, we get enough, and from various angles of cockpit and external.  There are fairly long stretches from different views, though Just Planes really needs to stop making a ""movie"" and just give us the video and let us choose the angle.  For example, we do get lengthy external views on landing (not takeoff), but they sometimes jump 10 miles for no apparent reason, and we get African music, and creepy classical music, and no real sound at all, instead of ATC in the backgrounds.  Just once, Just Planes, I'd like a flight with the first and last 15 minutes in cockpit with no interruptions, and the same 15 in the external view with no interruptions, both with the pilot and ATC communication.

That said, Ethiopian cross trains pilots to fly both the 777 and 787, and we see how the 787 cockpit can be configured to essentially mimic the 777 cockpit, but also can he heavily customized if the pilot prefers.  We see many of the physical changes in the aircraft that makes it a new generation.  We also learn a lot about how the aircraft uses electrical systems in place of hydraulic or mechanical systems for many functions, ironic as the aircraft is grounded at the time I write this because of battery issues.

All in all, well worth the time and money, a fine addition to the Blu-Ray library from Just Planes.",1361923200,4,1762,4.597444089456869
