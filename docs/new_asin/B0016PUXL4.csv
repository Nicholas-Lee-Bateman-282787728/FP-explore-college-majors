8264046,5,B0016PUXL4,"My son, age 6, is a huge Sonic fan.  He received this from us as one of his birthday gifts and he loves it!  He has watched it multiple time.  My daughter, age 9, also seems to enjoy it, although not as much as her brother.

As cheep as these little Sonic DVDs are, I will be purchasing more.",1411948800,,292,3.8983050847457625
8264047,4,B0016PUXL4,"Sonic was a childhood favorite of mine and my son is carrying on the tradition.  This movie took me back for a few minutes to a much simpler time, I was glad I could share this moment with him.  Thanks!!",1367280000,,203,4.05
8264048,3,B0016PUXL4,"My son wanted a Sonic the Hedgehog DVD for Christmas & even asked Santa Claus for it when he seen him! I found this one & thought I'd go ahead & buy it since I couldn't find them in store. It's a really, really old story & it is only one episode with a bunch of commercial type interruptions in it, but my son doesn't seem to mind too much. I  wish I would have know this though, maybe I would have shopped around more for something a little more up to date & longer. But, that being said, it is worth the price & everything shipped fast & in good condition.",1350691200,,558,3.982142857142857
8264049,5,B0016PUXL4,"What a great DVD for children!  The protagonist, Sonic, has to fight his way out of yet another dilemma with style and grace.  There is no real violence and great action scenes.  Good for ages 3 and up.",1223856000,6,202,4.2631578947368425
