2754079,3,B000N3AW6G,"Turistas has a lot going for it: gorgeous scenery, generous helpings of gore, a fair amount of T&A, and Caipirinhas!  I do believe this is the first entry into the genre that takes place in Brazil.  Turistas sort of has a Hostel feel in the beginning.  As the partying is taking place in mixed company, it's way tamer and much more directed to the teen crowd.  As the story gets going there are flashes of Final Destination and even one scene that seems to be a nod to the old Italian cannibal films.  The biggest downside to the film is that there are basically no scares.  The setup made me a bit uneasy feeling, but the bad guys really aren't all that bad.  Turistas does not break any new ground, but it does deliver the typical teens in peril scenario in a beautiful and international setting.  Also, this movie features the most swimming in a movie since Open Water.  The end of the film starts to feel a bit like a Jacques Cousteau film.  If you go in with an open mind and just take it for what it is, Turistas won't disappoint too much.  It's definitely better than some of the other films we've had to choose from this year.

2754122,3,B000N3AW6G,"This is a true horror movie, but with wicked humans being the source of the horror. The unrated version has upper body nudity, if that is important to you, but the suspense removed the impact of all the bikini clad women for me because you could tell that something was coming and these people were not exercising any kind of common sense and kept getting in deeper instead of being prudent. It takes place in Brazil. I have lived in South America for several years in troubled and dangerous places, and these tourists missed all the signs until it was too late. The ugly part of the last half of the movie is sufficiently horrible that I fast forwarded through a lot of it. The ending is satisfactory, but overall the movie left a bad taste in my mouth, even though the acting was good and several of the characters were good people, though in a terrible life or death situation. The movie does make a moral statement that is impossible to miss. The really chilling thing is that the villains in this movie made me understand that things like this really probably do occur in parts of the world, not necessarily just in Brasil either (Latin spelling of Brazil uses an s.) In retrospect, I have concluded that the ""Unrated"" rating is more about the horror than the partial nudity. Compare it to ""Apocalypse Now"" but only with tourists in a foreign country. It ought to be required viewing for all 20-somethings planning to go carouse in third world countries. I most definitely wouldn't go without someone who spoke the native language and was proven trustworthy from a trustworthy source (as in like local missionaries). This movie has real horror and expect it to leave a bad taste in your mouth; still, overall, I am glad I bought it because it made me really think about what I would have done in that type of situation. I would definitely have been the teetotaler! And for that I probably would have been the first to be killed.",1386806400,2,1933,4.573487031700288

Horror is horror - but each film has its own characteristics. When you want to watch an edge-of-your-seat, not-to-deep horror flick, this is a good one. I love groups of young people finding themselves in the most unbelievable, yet entertaining, bit of mayhem. That's what you'll find with Turistas.

2754140,4,B000N3AW6G,"This is one from the `Backpacker Beware' genre, that really would put anyone off from going absolutely anywhere without a body guard. It stars Josh Duhamel as Alex, who is backpacking through Brazil with his sister Bea (Olivia Wilde) and their friend Amy (Beau Garret). They are on the worst driven bus in all of South America, when unsurprisingly the driver wrecks the thing. Everyone gets out and are told that the next bus has been booked - yaay! But that it will take ten hours to possibly arrive - boo!

So they decide to check out the local beach which has some exceedingly friendly locals and more narcotics than an Amsterdam Coffee Shop. So they decide that this is Paradise and together with three co travellers and another touring couple they decide to party on down. Two of these are brothers from London and Finn (Desmond Askew) has the strangest accent ever, but very recognisable, that might be why he gets to do so many voice overs for video games; any way I digress.

Once our plucky party animals wake up they realise they have been drugged and robbed, so in good old Western Tourist style they had off to inform the local Constabulary. Only there aint a Cop Shop, so they decide to reclaim their filched property from the locals; and it goes very bad very quickly. Luckily they have made friends with one local who comes to their aid. We also have a sub plot of tourists going missing on a regular basis and a trade in human body parts, but are these events linked - mwaahh etc.

Any way to say any more would be a plot spoiler and the whole point of this film is to be a horror, and it does work, whilst being moody, scary and quite gory all at the same time. There are also some stunning underwater shots and an awful lot of running about the place scantily clad; so a big well done to director John Stockwell for that. There is great tension throughout and yes a couple of plot holes but they are forgivable as this is one of those films that I did not have high hopes for but was really pleasantly surprised, but not that pleasantly surprised at some of the more gruesome scenes, and definitely not one to watch with a TV dinner or even a bag of crisps and you might be risking even with a cup of tea, so do take care.

Well acted, well paced and with the right amount of nice stuff to nasty stuff ratio that gets you to care about the characters and with enough oomph to keep you hooked until the end, and I am pretty sure the Brazilian Tourist Board would want to have a word with Mr Stockwell, but never mind as he has made rather a good little film - recommended.",1337126400,,2589,4.331958762886598
2754141,3,B000N3AW6G,"Worth watching at least one time. Turistas was an ok horror movie that has a similar story as the movie Hostel. Unfortunately Turistas doesn't flow as well as Hostel, the acting is not as good, and the characters are not as memorable.",1336780800,,234,4.595238095238095

Almost, All that they had to do, was add some extra light. But besides that, it was a really good film. I wish that they would have corrected the lighting, so it could have been 5 star. I have seen NO BUDGET movies with better lighting than this. Acting was Great, LOTS of Blood && Gore, And the Characters were very likable.",1330387200,,655,4.046153846153846
2754143,4,B000N3AW6G,"""Turistas"" (2006) is about a mixed group of Americans/Europeans/Australians vacationing in Brazil who redirect after a bus mishap to a small village on the coast. There they run afoul of a group that routinely takes advantage of tourists, in a very diabolical manner.

The reason ""Turistas"" has a mediocre general rating on Amazon (3/5 Stars) is because it's a cross-genre film, mixing adventure, thriller and horror. As a result, the gorehounds didn't find enough gore and the non-gorehounds found too much, turning both groups off.

In fact, one gorehound complained that the first 2/3 of the film - the first hour - is boring because it hardly had any gore. Of course, his favorite part was a bloody operation scene. How one-dimensional and moronic is that? Actually, I found the first hour to be the best part of the film.

The film was shot on location in Brazil and successfully shows that country's natural beauty, as well as its human squalor. It also reveals a somewhat more lawless society than America and Canada. Of course, this risks turning off Latin Americans, but - c'mon - everyone knows these are just the general facts; it certainly doesn't mean that Latin American countries are wholly cesspools of iniquity or that the USA and Canada are bastions of moral superiority.

Olivia Wilde stars as one of the protagonists; I guess she's known for being a babe but, although sorta pretty, I don't find her sexy at all in this movie. As a matter of fact, she's blown out of the water by her two co-stars, Melissa George and Beau Garrett, who are clad in bikinis most of the time. It goes without saying, the film scores high marks on this front.

The villain is a sociopath who justifies his actions in order to live with himself; his accomplices are made up of destitute Brazilians of varying loyalties. As another reviewer noted, I like the way the film addresses the reluctance and moral struggle of some of these accessories.

As pointed out above, amongst the occasional squalor there are numerous scenes of paradisical beaches, jungles, waterfalls and rivers. The waterfall/river sequences with the underwater caverns were an unexpected and creative touch.

Some reviewers complain about how dumb the protagonists are, particularly when they follow a friendly Brazilian they met the day before far into the jungle to find sanctuary at his uncle's remote abode. I guess these grumblers forgot to mention that the group HAD to get out of the village pronto because they almost started a riot after injuring one of the youths; it was clearly stated that the kid's father would be out for blood when he found out.

Someone else complained about the group's swim-respite at the waterfall as unbelievable, but this was after hiking ALL DAY and they were hot, dirty and tired; it would only be natural to want to dive in for a refreshing break.

Other than a slightly obnoxious loudmouthed Londoner, this was a pretty likable and believable group of people, headed well by Josh Duhamel. Their only real dumb move was getting totally sloshed on the beach and therefore setting themselves up for victimization. But isn't that a severe weakness of most 20-somethings on vacation (as well as teen-somethings, 30-somethings and 40-somethings)?

Some complain that ""Turistas"" is a ""Hostel"" knock-off, but both films were in production around the same time (""Turistas"" started filming a mere two months after ""Hostel"" went into production and both films were released in 2006) and, besides, if ""Turistas"" really wanted to rip-off ""Hostel"" wouldn't it have played up the torture angle a lot more? As it is, ""Turistas"" is pretty tame compared to ""Hostel,"" as far as horrific torture scenes go. Not to mention ""Turistas"" has many aspects that ""Hostel"" lacks: Brazil, paradisical settings, jungles, more likable protagonists, better women, etc.

FINAL WORD: ""Turistas"" is horrifying because something like this could happen to you while vacationing in a third world country. But, thankfully, it's more than just a horror flick. There's a lot of fun, adventure and thrills, not to mention the quality locations and Melissa George & Beau Garrett prancing around in bikinis, lol!

I've never been to Brazil, but I have heard that kidnapping is somewhat common in the region. Its starts out with some Tourists who get stranded after their bus breaks down. They eventually make their way to a picture perfect spot on the beach, full of beautiful women, booze and the works. They are soon befriended by a local ""Kiko"" and then things get interesting. After a night of partying (and one lucky guy ;-) they wake up to find their gear and money all gone. A victim of dugs in their drinks, they decide to try and find help in a local village, but wind up getting into trouble with the locals. Chaos ensues and they find themselves being lead to ""safe shelter"" by Kiko their local friend or so they think... Once they arrive in their hidden paradise, things quickly go from care free to scare fest! Overall a decent flick. I just wish they would come out with a Blu Ray version of it!",1282089600,,1036,4.345360824742268

Before I continue I would like to warn any and all readers that there are possible spoilers. Also to the poster of that review...STEPHEN...please have the common sense to say spoiler alert when you're reviewing potential spoilers...

*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*

""Personally, I thought Turistas was scarier and sexier than Hostel, and had more likable protagonists and more interesting villains""
^Uh, if you think this movie is scary, that just shows that you are an amateur horror movie watcher. When was it scary in this movie? You must be already spooked out like crazy to be scared in this movie, it didn't even have any surprises in this movie! It's all straightforward and predictable. Throwing in the word sexier means you're one crooked dude. Who the heck watches a scary movie to get turned on??? How messed up is that?

""Among the better movies from the recent batch of extreme/torture horror""
^If you say so... 2/3rds or MORE of the movie contains no torture or any real horror. In fact there's only like a few mins of ONE person getting tortured. How the heck can you say it's a better of anything?? Seriously, and 24 people agreed with him and only 1 or 2 disagree? Just goes to show you that 90-95% of the population knows squat about anything. Remember, it's not an insult if it is true. Hostel, even though not much of a good movie either, contains multiple torture scenes which by the way has the victims screaming and pleading for their lives unlike this movie in the most part, this movie contains a short few min single torture and she was sedated!! There was no screaming!

""""Turistas"" also brings up the level of its bad guys a bit more than a number of similar movies have done. The ringleader of the group, while certainly not rising to the level of a character like Jigsaw, is well-crafted and believable, a highly intelligent but unflichingly sadistic mastermind""
^Uh, what are you talking about? Most movies show at least this much. Hostel for one reveals an organization that sells people out, in the movie's case, to be tortured by the potential buyer who sometimes buy based on the victim/subject's global origins/residence. I have no clue how you included jigsaw and well-crafted into an obviously plain out lacking movie like this. The only thing the movie revealed was that he was a doctor and towards the end reveals that he wants their organs to sell for a lot of money. And 24 or so people agreed to this review? We should scan these people...

""With the movie developing into some intense battles, it's in ways like an action movie that's presented as a horror movie""
^Uh no it's just a horror movie with action....it's not an action movie that is presented as a horror movie. You see, your misinterpretation of the movie is further proof why this horror movie failed, there wasn't enough horror to the point where you mistakenly thought it was an action type movie instead. Intense battles? You're joking right? You must be watching some Rambo on the side or something or flipping multiple channels while watching this. Intense battles...hahaha cracked me up. There was action but there was nothing intense or original about it. It was entertaining somewhat, I give it that, but intense....man...whatever you had give me some of that.

TO EVERYONE:

This movie is really a lame and disappointing movie in the fact that more than 2/3rds (movie is about an hour and a half and an hour or more of the movie) contains no gore or real horror. It's just the typical bunch of college students acting reckless like countless other movies. Then they're led to a house and there's like a few very short moments where the doctor sedates a young lady and takes out a few organs. Since she's sedated there's no agony to be had, she just looks on in a daze like consciousness. Then there is the escape and a few didn't make it. But seriously, no real torture and the movie builds up all this stuff to have a silly, weak, and very unsatisfying ending. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The plus side however is that it is watchable and entertaining until the hour mark passes because you were actually expecting something.

You will only view this movie to be really horrific is if you're totally not use to these kinds of movies altogether like our little STEPHEN friend there and the 24 people that agreed to his obviously .............. review. The guy knows nothing about what he's talking about, period. Want something to cringe at? Check out snuff films and documentaries. Now THAT is something horrific, this is laughable.",1282003200,,4660,4.730295566502463

2754150,3,B000N3AW6G,"Turistas (2006) is a tropical variation of the backwoods killer thriller, with a group of tourists running into horrific circumstances while vacationing in Brazil.  The film has a very organic, and realistic look and feel, as much of the movie was actually shot on location in Brazil, providing a variety of looks, from beautiful beaches, waterfalls, and underwater caverns, to the mostly dank, damp, and muddy conditions in the jungle.

Passengers aboard a bus travelling along a rural road, are unexpectedly stranded, when the driver loses control, and the bus tumbles down the side of hill.  Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) is Alex, travelling with his sister Bea (Olivia Wilde, House), and her best friend Amy (Beau Garrett).  After the crash they form a group with Pru (Melissa George, Alias, Grey's Anatomy), an Australian, and friends Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown) who hail from London.  Finding a beach with a bar nearby, the group decide hang out and party, instead of leaving on the next bus out.  It is all great fun, until after a night of heavy drinking, the group is robbed with left with nothing but the clothes on their backs.

Seeking help in a nearby village, the group nearly cause a riot, when Liam injures a boy.  A local boy name Kiko (Agles Steib) who they met earlier at the beach, comes to their rescue, and leads them on a trek into the jungle to escape the agitated villagers.  On the way to his uncle's house, Kiko shows the tourists his 'secret place', a waterfall with water filled caverns behind, and a large pool beyond.  Some of the group venture into the caverns, but their fun is interrupted when Kiko injures his head taking a plunge.  The group manages to find the uncle's house.  They are safe for the moment, but the group is uneasy.

Later that night, Kiko's uncle Zamora (Miguel Lunardi), and men with weapons arrive via helicopter, and things suddenly take a deadly turn.  Zamora is a doctor, but one with a twisted view of humanitarianism.  He begins operating on his captives, intending to harvest their vital organs.  Zamora explains that the 'contribution', will be a way for the gringo to give back to his people.  Tied up in animal pens, some of the group manage to escape with Kiko's help.  An attempt to save their friends, has disastrous results.  Strangely, the survivors head back into the underwater caverns.  It is not a good idea, as Zamora is waiting with a gun, at the large pool.  The survivors are forced back into the caverns.  Eventually they find a way out, and again Zamora is there.  Unfortunately for him, his bad management skills finally catch up with him.

The entire cast does a good job, under difficult conditions.  The authentic locations, and the casting of many locals, helps create an atmosphere of realism, and Turistas hangs together pretty well, up until near the end.  The caves are a cool location, and the underwater scenes were no doubt challenging to shoot, but perhaps a bit too much time is spent there.  The logic and geography of the caverns is something of a mystery.  Why Kiko leads the survivors into the underwater caverns, when there is apparently a faster way to the large open pool travelling by foot, is a mystery.  Being under falls, the caverns should be close to pitch black, and indeed when the swimmers pop up for air in the caves, it is dark, with the only light coming from a flashlight.  This makes sense, but what does not is that instead of being pitch black, the underwater environment is lighted well enough so the action can be filmed.  This is understandable from a practical standpoint, but it subtracts from the realism.

The DVD contains both the rated and unrated, widescreen versions of the film.  Two of the movie's most shocking scenes, involve Dr. Zamora.  In one, he kills a man by casually shoving a wooden skewer through his eye.  The second is an operation, where he cuts open the abdomen, and removes the liver and kidneys from one of the tourists.  These scenes may be too much for some to sit through, and they appear in both versions of the film.  The featurette, The Bloody Truth, shows how some of the film's more graphic scenes were accomplished.  Another bonus is an informative commentary track, by director John Stockwell, and producer Ken Kubena.  There was some controversy regarding the film, because of the negative aspects related to tourists.  However according to Stockwell and Kubena, they received a great deal of cooperation while in Brazil, and employed many locals in the making of the film.",1263254400,3,4540,4.763124199743918
2754151,2,B000N3AW6G,"Remember when horror movies, I mean cheap, drive-in knock-offs, used to be fun?

I don't know where they went to shoot this one.  It's supposed to be Brazil.  Maybe it is.  They usually go to Canada for dreck like this.  Or Romania.

This is a professional-enough looking film.  Nice photography, especially in the underwater cave sequences.

But it's just so...the usual.  Slasher/Torture Porn.  And not a lot of that, really.  The bloodthirsty generation of psychos who eat this kind of sadism up will be disappointed.  The kind of gore they crave is pretty much limited to one scene.  And that scene provides the only real nudity too (except for a couple of flashes during the beach scenes), so that part of the audience--the kind that used to like these movies for its cheap thrills and titillations--will be put off that the only real exposed beauty is having her organs removed while she's revealed.  I know that's Joe Bob Briggs bottom line reviewing...but what else is there?

Characters aren't that interesting.  Moments of uniqueness are quickly discarded for the torture porn formula.

2754152,3,B000N3AW6G,"This movie is rather typical of its genre, college age kids go to an exotic locale with the intent of drinking and debauchery, but then find themselves in a struggle for survival.  In this instance a group is lured to a secret hideaway of a mad doctor who is in the black market organ donation business.  He bills himself as a patriotic sort who wishes to make available to locals the organs that otherwise would go to big city American hospitals for wealthy clients.

So the scenes unfold in the Amazonian jungles.  There is suspense and the usual cast of attractive yet stupid characters.  As you watch this there is the dual question of which girl will undress and which of the group will be killed next.  But there is a fair amount of suspense as the chase moves through the jungle and into a river with underwater caves.  The problem here is these kids seem to know which direction to swim even though they have never been here before.  But it does have its entertainment value as the scenes are well acted and well filmed.

In the end there is really nothing remarkable about this film.  There are some survivors of the group, and it can pretty well be predicted which individuals do survive, but the film has somewhat of a pleasant ending.  However, we really don't know how they were able to fly without their passports and money, which had been stolen earlier.

2754153,3,B000N3AW6G,"3.5 stars.  This movie was much better than I expected it to be.  Most of what needs to be said has already been said but I felt that I should write up a my own review considering that I did not care for the movie Hostel as most people here have yet still enjoyed Turistas quite a bit.  It has taken me about 3 years to finally get around to seeing this movie, when I originally saw previews for it I wrote it off as just another ""me too"" torture porn which would be forever concealed in the shadow of 'Saw', 'The Hills have Eyes' and 'Hostel'.  I've been burned by plenty of other movies which took gore and torture to the extreme and once the shock value wore off I found myself in agonizing boredom.  'Wolf Creek' immediately comes to mind but Hostel is probably the personal letdown with the highest profile, other than every Saw sequel after the second installment.

Hostel bombards you with raw sexuality from the start then slaps that smile off your face with some of the most cringe worthy torture scenes I've ever seen in a movie.  It is no wonder the term ""Torture Porn"" was coined by a reviewer after having seen Hostel because that is essentially what it is; I wouldn't be surprised if some sicko actually got his jollies off watching the torture over the sex.  Hostel went from sex comedy to snuff film in the blink of an eye and though it was moderately entertaining, the movie loses it's steam pretty quickly once the shock value is gone.  Like 'The Devil's Rejects', it just became boring and gross once I got used to it.  It is hard for me to enjoy movies like this when superior horror flicks such as '28 Days Later' are being released at the same time and with plenty of gore of their own.  The first two Saw movies have clever plot twists underneath all the bloodshed but other than those two flicks the genre is incredibly shallow and relies on spilled guts as much as the abysmal 'Star Wars' prequels relied on CGI; all style and no substance.  I still have yet to see the sequel to Hostel, I'll get around to it at some point.

Now you know my background and my wariness when it comes to Saw/Hostel copycats.  Too many of these flicks were just plain boring for me to watch because I had seen it all before.  Turistas is a pleasant surprise!  It is just as shallow in terms of character development, acting and plot as other flicks in the genre but it relies more on suspense than actual gore.  For starters there is an awesome bus accident right in the beginning of the movie to get things going and the movie moves along pretty smoothly from there.  You know something is going to happen and that it won't be pretty but the movie teases you and plays with you until whatever blood lust you may have had is forgotten and you stop looking forward to the inevitable carnage and start to dread it.  Instead of gasping in horror, I found myself holding my breath.  Those familiar with the genre may be disappointed it isn't nearly as bloody as one might expect but I personally welcomed the reliance on suspense and uncertainty as if it were an old Slasher flick from the '70s and '80s.

*** possible but very minor spoilers below ***

There is a very well done underwater chase scene as well which only added to the suspenseful nature of the film.

I seriously considered giving the movie 4 stars but stopped short because of an anticlimactic ending.  I felt the movie just gave up on me instead of ending properly but this is my personal opinion.  I also don't feel a great urge to watch the movie again while a true 4 star movie would have me going back to certain scenes just to catch them one more time.  The girls and setting are gorgeous (it's Brazil - look out for Dark Skinned Brazillian beauty Lucy Ramos and Australian cutie Melissa George) while the sex and gore are somewhat muted in favor of suspense.  I also felt that the director could have done a better job juxtaposing the violence on screen with the beautiful Brazillian scenery.  One thing I definitely felt was missing from the film was a real intense one on one fight scene.

*** Spoilers done ***

I would definitely recommend this to friends and would love to watch it with a girl, it won't gross her out and might actually hold her interest as she clasps on to my arm.",1255996800,2,4264,4.401785714285714
2754154,4,B000N3AW6G,"A lot of people have compared this to Hostel, but this is a much better movie than Hostel.  First of all, this movie has more of a plausible plot.  Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors.  Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America.  Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie.  Very scary.

2754157,4,B000N3AW6G,"""Turistas"" is a shocking, gory little gem.  Don't watch it before you go on vacation to a South American country.  You may change your plans.

  The film begins with a heart pounding bus accident on the cliffs of Brazil, which leaves a group of American and European tourists stranded.  After their brush with death, they all become friends and decide to party at a nearby bar on the beach.  Their drinks are drugged and they awaken the next morning to discover all their possessions have been stolen.  There are no police and the locals have conspired not to help them.  One young man deceives them into following him to a remote house where a ghoulish nightmare ensues.

  Rife with suspense and gore, this film has a high body count.  Chase scenes abound, taking place in rain forests and flooded caverns.  The later scenes were very claustrophobic; I felt myself suffocating.  The acting from the young leads was very good and the photography was excellent.  It was hard to imagine that such gruesome horror could take place in the tropical beauty of this primitive paradise.  But the environment, as well as its people, are extremely deceptive.

  ""Turistas"" is highly recommended for those who prefer their horror taking place in the beautiful outdoors.  It should be watched as a double feature with ""The Ruins,"" which I have also reviewed.  Both movies involve innocent tourists fighting for their lives.",1241481600,,1412,4.8940677966101696

2754159,4,B000N3AW6G,"There are a few things every person traveling abroad must know.  One, don't drink the water.  Two, have your passport on you at all times.  Three, airport baggage handlers will either lose your baggage or destroy it.  Four, don't accept a drink from a stranger.  Five, update all vaccinations.  And, six, the most important rule, that's NOT a woman.  In Turistas, one unfortunate group of aimless pleasure-seekers definitely learns all but the most important lesson (maybe even them all).

When a group of likeable, sexy American tourists make their way to Brazil, they quickly see how enticing the country can be.  The beaches, the drinks, the women: all beautiful and exciting.  When their bus rolls down a hill leaving them stranded, they choose to stay for a while, partying it up with the amiable locals.  Bad news; a few of their new friends are psychotic murderers complicit in an extravagant organ-harvesting scheme.  Nothing scary yet - who really needs BOTH kidneys?

Well acted, well directed, a good amount of creative gore, tense thrills, and a few good boob shots...what else is a horror movie supposed to deliver?  For a fairly convincing and effective albeit fairly unoriginal horror movie, it's quite a terrifying concept and delivery.  However, there are two infuriating aspects to Turistas.

First, the message of American ignorance and disrespect is rendered completely pointless when considering the fact that those portrayed as open-minded about traveling are evidently meat-sacks with organs to be snagged whenever someone rich requires a transplant.  The other frustrating part is that cinematography is brilliant.  It's gorgeous, showing amazing shots of overflowing jungles, exquisite waterfalls, and the underwater caving scenes' translucent blues are simply unparalleled.  Meanwhile, it's almost a PSA for American xenophobia.  Why travel if the American tourist is considered a ripe for the picking organ grab bag?

Many will simply write-off Turistas as an unoriginal Hostel clone, but I enjoyed the cross-blending of sadistic, exploitation horror and visceral torture-porn.",1234310400,3,2104,5.412307692307692

First, this is my ninth horror film in nine days having just gone through the 8 files 2 die 4 that made up the 2007 edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/After-Dark-Horrorfest/dp/B0012RCNDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">After Dark Horrorfest</a>, and having not been overly impressed by any of those films I am not surprised that this one looks great in comparision.  Second, when I took Health in high school they showed us an educational film to convince us that smoking was a bad think which consisted of not just the traditional film of doctors cutting out a cancer ravaged lung but the beginning of the operation where they make the initial incision and then crack the chest open.  Believe me when I tell you that it was all the stuff before they got to ripping out that guy's rotten lung that had us ready to lose our breakfast (gym class was before lunch).  Third, my daughter headed off to Costa Rica last month to serve in the Peace Corps for the next couple of years, so the fact that I keep reading books (Kathy Reichs' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-Secrets/dp/0099307308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave Secrets</a>"") or seeing movies (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borderland/dp/B00127RAJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borderland</a>"") in which horrible things happen to young women in one of our Latin American neighbors is really starting to creep me out.

A bunch of turistas are on a bus going too fast on a roadway somewhere in Brazil.  When they find themselves suddenly off of the bus, a group of them decide to see if they can find a party instead of another bus.  We have Alex (Josh Duhamel), who is vacationing with his sister, Bea (Olivia Wilde), and her free-spirited friend, Amy (Beau Garrett).  Then there is Pru (Melissa George), visiting from Australia, and a couple of English blokes, Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown), who help make Alex look like the good guy that he is.  Along with some others the group indeed finds themselves a party, but this turns out to be bad news rather than good news by the time the sun comes up the next morning.  Then things good from pretty bad to infinitely worse.

The scene that first caught my attention in this 2006 film was the one with the first deaths, mainly because they were so quick and simple.  Horror movies tend to wallow on the death scenes these days, and certainly ""Turistas"" has one of the more protracted killings as its centerpiece,  Besides, there is an implicit lessons in those initial deaths, because killing is not the goal here, just a natural (so to speak) byproduct of the goal.  As for the scene that is supposed to get you, well, it really got me because to my way of thinking it was something that could really happen (plus I think regardless of the context what we are seeing taps into a basic human fear or two).  My main complaint with the film is a constant one as a fan of horror films, which is that I did not find the end game to be as strong as the set up.  Granted, very few horror films have endings as good as their set ups, but we would still like to hold out hope that things will work out that way.

As for the ""Turistas"" vs. ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>"" debate, it seems to be to be apples and oranges.  Although they are both are young people traveling in foreign lands and having horrible things happen to them, ""Hostel"" is quintessential torture porn and I do not see ""Turistas"" as being in that contemporary sub-genre of horror films.  Besides, I thought the element that worked best in ""Hostel"" was not the graphic violence and dismemberment but the whole ""what the hell is going on here?"" bit.  In the traditional splatter flick (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B00009UW0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>"") the audience is usually aware of the backstory that explains the killer's motivation, while the victims are usually left in the dark.  In ""Hostel"" we do not have a clue (which is why the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequel/dp/B000UJ48P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequel</a>&nbsp;had to go in a different direction given that the audience cannot be surprised twice).  Both stories are sort of predicated on urban legends (if something happening in a Brazillian jungle can be said to fall into that category), so each may be equally ludicrous judged in the light of day, but what happens in ""Turistas"" strikes me as something that human beings have really done to each other much more so than anything that happens in the factory in ""Hostel.""

Final Note (contains what is technically a minor spoiler):  I am getting really tired of the naked girl always having to die in horror films as a punishment for her sexuality, even when this commonplace practice is given a sick twist like it is in ""Turistas.""  I know that ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>"" provided a twist on the virgin always being the one to survive in a horror film, but I am ready for somebody to make a film where the naked girl is the sole survivor at the end (no, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Terror/dp/B000UAE7O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Terror</a>"" does not count, and, yes, I know that such a film with inevitably show the naked girl totally covered in blood and gore).",1206662400,5,5781,5.475815523059618
2754171,4,B000N3AW6G,"Among the better movies from the recent batch of extreme/torture horror, it's a shame that Turistas is probably destined forever to live in the shadows of the ""Hostel"" series, because it's significantly better than either installment that Hostel has yet produced.  Following an unmistakably similar plot as the first ""Hostel"" - although I think both movies started production at about the same time and this one just took longer to finish - ""Turistas"" finds (as does its better-known peer) a group of vacationers travelling to an exotic hot spot (in this case Brazil) for a fun-filled getaway, only to run afoul of a local group of brutal, torture-minded psychopaths.  The main differences are, I guess, rather subjective.  Personally, I thought Turistas was scarier and sexier than Hostel, and had more likable protagonists and more interesting villains.  In the first half, there's little overtly horror movie-ish about the film: the main group is prevented from going to their upper-scale tourist destination because of a bus mishap, and ends up at a more off-the-main-path destination, a small village by the beach without the big hotels from tourist brochures, but with festive, smaller-scale, attractions - open air beach bars, big evening bonfire parties, all that kind of thing.  They end up making friends with some fellow travellers and with the locals, but some of those locals have a keen interest in the newcomers that doesn't seem to be on the up and up.  Come the next day, the vacationers find they've been robbed and the village starts to seem less than friendly, so, with the help of a local they've befriended, head off towards less threatening envirorns, travelling through a swath of rainforest on what turns out to be a very ill-fated trek.  The sexy, fun-natured and sometimes humorous angles of the early parts end up meshing very well (and better than what might be expected) with the dark, deeply intense nature of the movie's second half.

  Having established its tourist characters as actually likable and interesting, ""Turistas"" also brings up the level of its bad guys a bit more than a number of similar movies have done.  The ringleader of the group, while certainly not rising to the level of a character like Jigsaw, is well-crafted and believable, a highly intelligent but unflichingly sadistic mastermind.  For his accomplices, he's surrounded himself not only with like-minded psychopaths, but a few less obvious choices: desperate, confused and often embittered characters, who he's recruited by not only presenting to them the only feasible means out of their own destitution, but by being a smooth, manipulative talker who can paint even horrible acts (such as his 'organ-harvesting' operation) as being somehow justified.  The prescence of these 'reluctant villains', and of the element of the evil charmer who's skilled enough to make people act in ways they'd normally never even consider, are both welcome angles.

  With the movie developing into some intense battles, it's in ways like an action movie that's presented as a horror movie.  It manages some genuine scares, and hits psychological horror notes as well as gory, visceral horror notes.  Well acted and well directed, with impressive camerwork, especially in the underwater sequences.  The movie utilizes a kind of unique use of lighting, and sometimes color, to create an effect that really captures the atmosphere and heat, making certain daytime scenes feel like they're drenched in hot sunlight.

  ""Turistas"" is a fine addition to the pantheon of horror movies, and shouldn't be overlooked just because of its similarities to other movies, although the torturous nature of the organ-harvesters means that it's not for everybody.  It is a reminder though, that just because a movie isn't exactly reinventing the wheel in terms of storyline, it can still be a great movie.",1201392000,35,3882,5.166134185303514
2754172,4,B000N3AW6G,Turistas is in my opinion a movie with a lot of spice and drama.  The scenery is not bad either.

The tourists are welcomed to a nearby small town while waiting for another bus that seems to be perfect for parties on the surface, but holds a dark secret underneath.

**Potential Spoilers**
Featuring stock characters and stock gore, this film struggles to find its way.  At one point it is a gore film, but when compared to other recent splatter flicks like ""Hostel"" and ""Wolf Creek,"" it comes up short in the blood and guts department.  Next we find it trying to be a suspense yarn with underwater cavern chases.  Unfortunately, these chases become boring to watch and difficult to keep up with.  Lastly, the movie takes a light shot at social commentary, but organ stealing is hardly a new topic, and I honestly don't think that most tourists are as dense as this gaggle of goof-offs.

Now I do understand that the characters had to be somewhat dumbed down in order to move the tale along, but I found myself not really pulling for any of them.  I could care less who lost their kidneys or if they were conscious when their livers were removed.  We are expected to cheer on Duhamel and his on-screen sister, Bea (Olivia Wilde), but I really saw no reason to.  The rest of the group serves no great purpose other than to be victims, excepting the supposed ""smart"" member of the party, Pru (Melissa George).

The primary villain in this film, Zamora (Miguel Lunardi), comes off as an arrogant dictator who isn't as tough as you'd expect a primary villain to be.  I honestly don't see how any of his lackeys could fear him.  In fact, he wasn't scary at all.

Light gore, dull suspense, a disjointed plot, and modest acting adds up to a clunker in my book.  I'd consider ""Turistas"" a rental at best.  If you prefer more gore (though not necessarily a better story) check out the ""Hostel"" flicks.  For an actual good gory story, ""Wolf Creek"" is your best bet.  For suspense in a cave, I highly recommend ""The Descent.""",1197417600,3,2445,4.611111111111111

They end up in the Brazilian jungle and entangled in an overly complicated yet ultimately simplistic plot involving bandits and other nefarious types.

As others have mentioned, ""Turistas"" comes across as a rip-off of ""Hostel.""  Apparently these two movies were made at about the same time, so it's a bit unfair to dismiss ""Turistas"" thusly.  However, the rather mediocre ""Hostel"" at least had some interesting twists and chases - can't say the same thing for ""Turistas.""  Unfortunately, every move in this movie is blatantly telegraphed ahead of time, so there are no surprises.  The gore factor is about all ""Turistas"" has going for it, and even that is brief and so poorly shot as to be inconsequential.

While waiting for a new bus to arrive, the travelers find a small beach that has a bar and decide to stay there and party. In the morning they find they've been drugged and all their belongings stolen. One of the natives from a nearby village that they met the night before leads them to a house in the jungle where they can stay until they figure out how to get home. It turns out the house is owned by a doctor who harvests organs from white people in some misguided revenge for his country being exploited by rich tourists.

Turistas was better than I thought it would be, but I wasn't really expecting much. It takes too long to get going and you can predict what's going to happen at every turn. There are some tense moments during an underwater sequence near the end, but it's not scary. For me the scariest part was wondering what I would do if I was stranded in a foreign country with no money, no passport and couldn't speak the language. I wouldn't do what these kids did which was to trust someone who helped rob them the night before and follow him deep into the jungle. Basically Turistas is dumb people doing dumb things and the organ harvesting was a flimsy plot device to throw in some gore.",1196812800,2,1375,4.288461538461538
2754178,5,B000N3AW6G,"I love how this movie shows the two extremes of Brazil; the beauty and the beast so to speak of touring a country that has extremely lovely beach and jungle areas, but also bleak areas of poverty where corruption and crime ruin lives.  Great concept for a movie, and very well written and filmed in my humble opinion.  I really appreciated the cave/water scenes, since they are often so difficult to do.  The action gets intense, and some scenes are pretty gruesome (don't eat your dinner in front of this film if you have a weak stomach), but I really loved the story and acting.  This is a tale that makes you 'think' about some of the horrid things going on in the world and the chain reaction of greed.

2754180,2,B000N3AW6G,"Filmmakers have tried to touch rock bottom in horror and disgust in the last few years, each one vying to be the most original and shocking.  Just when Hostel made you think you couldn't go any lower, along comes Turistas.  I know what vivisection is but never saw it portrayed on film before.  It was admittedly shocking, and well-done (within a very narrow definition of that term). We even get the treat of listening to the evil doctor expounding a Marxist analysis of core and periphery states while pulling the vital organs out of the gasping, pleading victim.

But a good horror movie is more than one scene, or even a couple of other adequate ones.  Overall, the movie just doesn't cut it.  You've got the problems other reviewers have noted, such as the one-dimensional characters, and the script problem of ""We were drugged and robbed last night, and left without money or ID.  After walking for hours though the jungle, being led by someone we don't know, why don't we stop and go swimming at a waterfall!""  I also note that a philanthropic doctor who cuts out vital organs to help the poor is not the kind of person who would stab a person in the eye with a palito de churrasquinho.

Also, I think I just don't have patience for these types of movies anymore.  They're so formulaic: a group of adolescents goes to a remote location, where they get picked off one by one until the ending counter-attack.  Throw in some nice naked female flesh to keep the interest up.  Been there, done that.

These movies also take too long to get going.  Maybe if it's your first horror movie, the windup is worth something.  But after your first horror movie, the delivery takes precedence.",1193097600,,1686,4.610738255033557

2754182,2,B000N3AW6G,"This is a bad bad movie.  It doesn't even make sense.  For one thing, after the bus flips over a mountain in the beginning of the film and all the passengers barely escape, they stand around watching the bus roll off the cliff.  Five minutes later they seem to forget that incident took place.  Now I don't know about you, but if that happened to me, I'd be spending the rest of my day (and life) feeling extremely fortunate I escaped from the bus in time.

After that scene is over, the next 30 minutes of film is a waste of time.  It's nothing but a big party scene on a beach where a bunch of young adults are standing around talking and playing typical beach games.  No effort at all was involved to bring any kind of tension to this supposed ""horror"" movie.  It was just one big party scene.

After a while, a crazy guy decides he wants to cut open the bodies of the people he trapped and tied up, and steal their organs while they are awake.  Okay, that's pretty uncomfortable, but it wasn't enough to save the movie, because these scary moments only happen a couple times.  The action scenes at the end involving the people trying to run away from the guy and his friends WOULD have been cool had it not taken place at night, when we can't see what's going on.  Yeah, lots of action is taking place, but it was too dark to see.  You were basically staring at a dark screen guessing who was getting attacked.  I was actually wrong at first when I thought the main bad guy was being killed off, only for a lookalike to appear a few moments later.  Obviously it wasn't the same guy.

The underwater swimming moments were horrible as well.  Couldn't see anything.  The joke at the end about choosing either a bus or airplane to travel was out of place and unnecessary.  Bad movie.",1192838400,,1783,4.316265060240964

2754185,4,B000N3AW6G,"SHORT REVIEW, for those with limited BS-tolerance or ADD: ""Turistas"" puts a new spin the old slogan ""Yankee go Home"". This time, it's ""Yankee go home, but leave your brains, guts, Liver, & Pancreas behind, por favor."" Great flick, lots of blood & goop, ample tension, + bikinis. What's not to love?

LONG REVIEW, for those with too much TIME ON THEIR HANDS: Once upon a time Karl Marx, bearded great-granddaddy of really soaking the Rich, commented that the good society was one in which scarce resources were allocated ""from each according to his Ability, to each according to his need"".

Now, old-time Marxists---mostly your college professors and 30-something video-store clerks with English degrees, if you're wondering where they are---think that Marx was just groovy. Just right on, man. Everyone being equal, which is a great idea, you know, so that no matter how hard you work and slave & toil, you can rest in peace & comfort knowing that your slacker buddy who spends his days frying the hash (if you know what I mean) & watching reruns of ""Full House""---well, you two will always be making the same amount of jingle jangle.

Now, when you point out the obvious to these guys---you know, that Communism didn't work, resulted in the deaths of tens of millions and the economic derangement & impoverishment of Eastern Europe and Soviet Russia---these guys say ""well that's because true Marxism has never been tried"".

I've got news for those guys: it *has* been tried! And it works, baby, as ""Turistas"" cleverly demonstrates.

Unlike 'Hostel', which got down in the gutter with a bunch of filthy capitalist pig-dogs who wanted to go hunting humans, ""Turistas"" offers more uplifting fare: a Brazilian Dr. Zamora (played to fine ""get them thar gringos"" aplomb by Miguel Lunardi), who, outraged over seeing poor young Brazilians get chopped up for body parts which heal rich Anglos (I should know, man: I'm waiting for some Brazilian's brain!), decides to take the Power back! Or if not taking the Power, at least taking the aforementioned guts, liver, pancreas, brain, & so forth.

Hey, at least the organs will do *somebody* some good: all these kids are gonna do with 'em otherwise is drink 'em up on Spring Break. Dr. Zamora *has* seen ""The Real Cancun"", you know.

Best thing about ""Turistas"", other than the string bikinis and guttage: the villains. You've got to be able to boast some nasties, and ""Turistas"" does: Dr. Zamora is a real baddy. You know that, because not only does he lecture some kid about seizing the day over his afternoon frappucino, he also whacks some talky underling. Over Frappucino. Now *that* is a bad dude.

Anyway, flip over to the kids: their bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and faster than you can say ""I'd have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling kids"", Dr. Zamora is on the scene. Or something like that.

It's all good. Director John Stockwell has a handle on sand, sun, surf, & little nubile hardbodies in thongkinis: he has helmed up chick surfer flicks ""Blue Crush"" & ""Into the Blue"".  Evidently he wanted to get a little more beneat the tan line, and here he succeeds in spades. The dissection sequence in the hut is one of the more barf-inducing in recent memory, and brought to mind the old song ""I've got a lovely pair of Coconuts"". Good times!

Plus you've got all sorts of assorted coolness: killer villagers, nasty kids, rainswept jungle, helicopters swooping down CHOPPA-CHOPPA-CHOPPA in inky black darkness seconds after a particularly disturbing revelation, chop suey with guts in the operating room, involuntary organ donors, big ol' blood spatters, and a little manhunt with a crossbow. I don't know about you, but throw in some flashy camera-work and you've made a beachbum with a penchant for body parts outta me.

Pass the tanning oil.

2754186,4,B000N3AW6G,"Surely, Hostel pushes gore into new level. But to be honest I think Turistas is slightly more realistic than Hostel. A group of 20s something were picked up one by one and slaughtered for their internal organs while vacationing in Brazil (wonder whether this movie is banned in Brazil for bad publicity of its tourism).

Lead charactered is a brother and a sister (a rarity as flicks like this usually they are lovers - also check out Jeepers Creepers 1 as the main heroes are also brother and sister)

Overall, the movie is well-paced, well-balanced between action, gore, humour and yes, SEX. The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes. There is also a good commentary by director John Stockwell.

2754188,3,B000N3AW6G,"I really wanted to love this film. I thought it would have everything that could possibly appeal to me - a beautiful setting, gore, humor, suspense, Brazilian music.

Nope. Fell flat, right on its face. Now, anyone could tell by the trailers and some of the movie posters that it would be a Hostel rip-off. I'll give it credit in saying yes, it is much more believable than Hostel in that organ donation participation could certainly stand to be increased (not only in smaller countries, but everywhere). And yes, I imagine a well-cared-for American organ would most likely be a very, very good thing to a villager in another country in dire need. So that's the upside - that this could quite conceivably happen, I suppose.

I just really wish the matter was approached differently. Again, we have foolish characters far from home. A rickety bus ride through a winding mountainside? SURE! Walking through this jungle in the middle of nowhere to have a freakin' drink? I'll lead the way! Following this young boy who barely speaks English deeper into the jungle and putting my life in his hands? WHY NOT?! It just exasperates me, the level of sheer stupidity that these characters display.

Parts of the movie were entirely too dark - I had to temporarily up the contrast on my TV just so I could see what happened once they reached Kiko's uncle's house. Other parts of the movie were absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes were beautiful to watch. The movie isn't completely a waste, but I'm very glad I didn't spend money to watch it.

For those who enjoy lengthy underwater swimming scenes, this is right up your alley. It seemed that the film prided itself on the underwater scenes above anything else.

The problem with this film is that it is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. You know what is going to happen from the opening scene. You know who's in on it and what is going to happen. It's nothing like the first Hostel with the shocking ending, you know something is up as soon as the senorita behind the bar starts making phone calls. You knew something bad was going to happen the next morning after all the drinking on the beach.

And what's up with just one medical victim?? It was almost disappointing to see the doctor only work on one patient. But I guess we do get some gunshot victims, a large toothpick to the eye, and a stabbing in the cage. And it was nice to see the doctor get his instead of letting him live and having Turistas II unleashed on us next year.

What happened to actually trying to scare people instead of making them want to vomit while watching? I admittedly haven't seen the other films of this type--Saw, Hostel, etc--but if they are anything like this movie, I don't want to.

A group of kids arrive in Brazil planning a get away. When the bus they are traveling plunges off a cliff (man, I hate when that happens...) they find themselves stuck in Brazil for some time. They meet some people and decide to stay with some of the locals. They drink themselves silly, and decide that Brazil is better than sliced bread. Little do they know that the drinks are spiked with a little more than vodka. After their raging first night, they wake up to realize they've been drugged and that their possessions are gone.  One piece of advice: beware the organ doctors here; they are a rough group, especially Zamora. It gets worse. From here, it is a struggle to find out how to get home, and where they are going, and what is going on. Will they escape the madman doctor? One only knows....

The movie tends to drag on and on with each endless and seemingly absurd scene. It seems to be a movie that wants to scream out: ""Hey, look at these hot people on this island with a mad doctor! Kind of cool, crazy and scary all at the same time, huh!"" Too much fluff, not enough substance.

2754197,4,B000N3AW6G,"Turistas (John Stockwell, 2007)

I think Turistas may hold the record for speed of a theatrical release making it to DVD; I was watching it at home less than three months after it came out in the theaters. And while I have to say I understand why it redefined the term ""box-office disaster,"" it's not nearly as bad a film as I was expecting it to be. Much of the problem, both with my expectations and (I suspect) the turnout at the cinema, had to do with the press' endless comparisons between this film and Hostel, comparisons which are about as warranted as those between, say, My Fair Lady and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Yes, there's the same mix of sex and violence, but in nowhere near the same ratio (nor amount) to be found in the wonderful world of Eli Roth. I'd have a hard time believing that Stockwell had to do anywhere near as much cutting to get his R as Roth did.

Stockwell (Nixon) opens his film with three characters on a Brazilian vacation--Alex (Las Vegas' Josh Duhamel), his sister Bea (Alpha Dog's Olivia Wilde), and her friend Amy (Guess model Beau Garrett). A combination of inattention and aggression in the bus driver causes an accident, and the three of them, along with some newfound friends--Pru (Melissa George, recently of The Amityville Horror), an Australian, and London brothers Finn (The Hills Have Eyes' Desmond Askew) and Liam (TV actor Max Brown)--find what seems to be paradise just down the hill, a white sandy beach with a bar run by beautiful, mysterious Camila (Brazilian actress Andrea Leal, in her first major American appearance). The six of them hook up with Svend (Gustav Roth) and his girlfriend Annika (Olga Diegues), who have been staying there for the past three days, and the group is set. Oh, except for the token native, Kiko (Agles Steib), a Brazilian who's been studying English, but hasn't had any native speakers on which to test his skills. As with all paradises, you know things are about to go bad quickly. They do.

Where Hostel seemed to me to be far less about plot and more about how much Roth could get away with within the Hollywood machine (rather like Wes Craven's Last House on the Left thirty-plus years previous), Turistas imposes a plot, interesting characters, etc. on the formula (continuing the parallel, think, say, Men Behind the Sun). For the most part, I think, Stockwell quite succeeds, but the trade-off is that the gorehound crowd get not nearly as much of what they're looking for, while the plot-and-character crowd will find their stomachs turned by what little gore there is (there's really not enough nudity to cause anyone to squirm, and what there is is, with the exception of one comedic scene, presented in the least sexy way possible; Stockwell was not out to titillate here). Thus, like so many neglected movies, the main problem with Turistas is not really a problem at all: it's just a movie that no one knows how to categorize, and thus how to market, and the audience who would've found it enjoyable were too busy dismissing it as either too gory or not gory enough.

If you didn't catch it the first time round, and you almost certainly didn't, it's worth a rental, if you're into that sort of thing. *** ",1180137600,3,3208,4.680851063829787

Harvesting precious organs from tourists, you say?  Oh, that explains why as soon as they run, you hack them up or shoot them.

A beautiful location, as well as a fair amount of money were squandered on this pointless film.  The cheesy special effects they tried to pass off as gore made the film even worse.

I love the horror/thriller genre.  I love a truly bad, low budget gore flick.  This picture was simply meaningless.  Not even so bad it's good.

On a lighter note, some may find the special effects featurette quite entertaining and bring a silver lining to the experience.

2754208,3,B000N3AW6G,"`Turistas', written by Michael Arlen Ross and directed by John Stockwell promises to be one of the `new style' horror flicks, in the same league as `Hostel' or maybe `Descent'. I find that while the venue, the horror, and the escape may offer fresh twists, this does tend to be new wine in old skins, with all the Biblical dangers that involves.

In its simplest terms, it is another telling of the story of seemingly bright teenagers doing something colossally stupid, thereby landing them in a life-threatening situation. None of that should really give much away. Unlike the `Saw' and `Ring' franchaises, the attraction is less in what happens than in how it happens, and I will endeavor to say nothing more about this than what you may have seen in the trailer.

One thing which reduced the impact for me of the movie's better scenes is the fact that they were done in semi-darkness. Unfortunately director Stockwell is no Ridley Scott, the master of the dark ambiance (See `Alien' and `Blade Runner'). I would offer that horrific scenes in such great flicks as `Marathon Man' and `Silence of the Lambs' work just as well or even better for taking place in full light. An even better case for good lighting may be some of Stanley Kubrick's best scenes from `The Shining', where he had all the excuses in the world for doing things in the dark. While the dark may have been necessary in `The Descent', it was not necessary in `Turistas' except in two excellent series of scenes on which I will say no more.

While it is never a major requirement in B horror movies (unless your director happens to be Quentin Tarantino), the acting in this movie seems to be just a bit better than average.

My last criticism is that the movie did not milk its novel situation as well as it could have, in order to distinguish it from other movies which used the same premise, but not in the `horror' genre.

The director's commentary is always a welcome addition to any DVD. I did not, however, consider this one notably better than any other commentary; certainly not on the level of my favorites from indie director, Kevin Smith.

2754212,1,B000N3AW6G,"This could have been a good film.  The concept of a sinister network of body farmers capturing and using backroads tourists has a lot of consideration to it.  The idea of paradise lost, the idea of Americans finding themselves way over their head, not a new concept, but still, could have worked here.  I think we've all heard the many urban legends about tourists living and dying in South America.  Makes you definitely want to stick to the Frommer's guides!  But for me it did not work well at all as I watched this film.  Mind you, I watched this film then I balanced it with Hostel.  I'll explain why.  First off, yes we know that if not for Hostel, who would be considering this movie.  The problem is that Hostel, and I'm not the biggest fan of the movie but I do give a nod of respect toward it, had characters that developed and had characters you could relate to.  The characters in Hostel were cliche, yes, but at least you knew you could comprehend them and you were chilled by all that happened to the main characters...one by one.  This movie I think tried too hard to be like Hostel, which I'm willing to bet the second Hostel film couldn't be like the first one.  Second off, the ""torture"" movie genre that is being played for all its worth...i.e. Saw I through a billion, Wolfs Creek, Hostel...is either a hit or miss.  You are either enraptured by the suspense and the pay off for the suspense, or you are downright bored.  For Turistas, you are truly (and this is my opinion) bored because you (going back to the first point) can't really care about the characters.  The characters are almost idiots as they go in a zombieque mannerism from one scene to the next.  All you can do is sit back and watch the screen and say to yourself ""It is only ninety minutes...it is only ninety minutes..."" but man, how 90 minutes can drag out for an eternity.  Cardboard has more texture then the characters of Turistas.  And when the ""horror"" (really isn't that bad, I've seen worse on Court TV) happens, all you can do is shrug and fight off the horrific temptation of using the fast forward button.  And mind you, that's the same reason that out of the entire genre of ""torture"" movies, I've only been able to respect Hostel.  Again, it isn't my favorite film, but at least it gives the ""torture"" horror movie audience what they want...a growing development and then a horrific pay off.  Turistas really doesn't have that.  We see one operation scene.  That's it.  We see a lot of dark chases.  Gun shots.  That's it.  There is no tightness of horror.  There's only time wasted.  That's my take on it.  Do with it as you wish.  I would, at the very most, say this was a renter and not a buyer kind of movie.",1175385600,4,2715,4.424242424242424

2754215,3,B000N3AW6G,"I think it's important to acknowledge that ""Turistas"" is a viscerally graphic film--not nearly as graphic as the infamous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guinea-Pig/dp/B000679MJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guinea Pig</a>&nbsp;films but certainly more so than, say, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;films. As such, this film falls into a rapidly growing group of films in which graphic gore is central to the film, often, it seems, the primary reason for the film. Criticizing the film on that ground is, I think, misguided, almost as criticizing musicals for the fact that they have singing is misguided. The relevant question is: Does the movie work given its genre and aims? The answer is mixed.

The plot is fairly thin. A group of young adults survives a bus accident on a winding Brazilian road, happens upon a beach with a well-stocked bar, ends up drugged and robbed, and, for reasons the movie does explain, flees to an isolated, albeit luxurious, cabin in the Brazilian mountains. The cabin is owned by the uncle of a local, and the uncle turns out to be the brains and surgical skill behind a string of organ thefts.

There are, it must be noted, holes galore in the plot, and the characters are, as so often happens in movies like this, paper-thin. Still, the film is well acted, extraordinarily well shot, and generally suspenseful. It is not, however, frightening. Instead, the graphic nature ends up being more like a filmed autopsy. One may want to look away, but only because the gore is convincing, not because it is frightening. Even so, when one does look, the effects are extremely well done.

Where ""Turistas"" falls flat is precisely where the ""Friday the 13th"" films fall flat. The characters are so thin and the villain so preposterous that it is difficult to empathize with anyone or think that this really could happen. Maybe, just maybe, we can accept that there are organ thefts. We might also accept the film's premise that there are people who believe Americans (or Westerners in general) are so smug and selfish that they deserve to give up a kidney (or two) and a liver to help the less fortunate. But to have the nefarious doctor engage in a tendentious and pompous explanation of the good his deeds do is downright silly, especially when he is so sadistic as to keep the patient conscious during the organ removal--or at least part of it.

But here we return to the gore and the apparent raison d'etre of the film--to showcase extremely well-done effects. And here, ""Turistas"" succeeds. So we end up with a film in which it is difficult to empathize with the characters or care especially when they die, in which the villain is so absurd that the ""it could happen"" angle is all but absent, in which there is no particular depth or originality to the plot, but in which the pace (in the second half) and the effects do make the movie passable if not great.",1175299200,,3059,5.1737373737373735

Alex (Fergie's boyfriend, Josh Duhumel) is the uptight older brother of typical teenage sister Bea. Not much serious acting is required of anyone here. The best character/actress would have to be Pru, who is able to convey a lot of things in both English and Portuguese. There is a great under water chase scene that left me a little breathless. I don't know that I need to buy this for my permanent collection, but was a good rental. Don't be afraid to watch it because of the comparisons to Hostel, they are really nothing alike. My husband HATED Hostel and couldn't sit through the whole thing, but he was able to really get into this movie and watched all of it. He did say he's not visiting South America any time soon though...",1175212800,,998,4.638418079096045
2754218,1,B000N3AW6G,"Those of you who are curious about Turistas won't miss anything earth shattering if you pass it by. As other reviewers have correctly pointed out, this movie is another lame attempt at extreme horror in the recent  subgenre of torture films, a la SAW, HOSTEL, etc. However, Turistas is really bad, and is simply a movie where the violence and gore exist for the sake of the movie. Without these elements, you have no movie. Unlike decent horror films that actually stand on their own without gratuitous blood and guts (but include them for extra effect), Turistas is boring and filled with more holes than swiss cheese.

Every scene of blood and gore is unnecessary; when a girl falls off a cliff, do we need to see her splat on the ground to know she died in the fall? When a guy gets his head split open, do we need to constantly see his gaping head wound? And when some dude staples it shut with a staple gun, do we need to see this done in loving detail? To demonstrate how evil the Brazilian surgeon is, did he really have to plunge a skewer through the eye of his henchman and stir it around until he died? (All done at an outdoor cafe, and no one bats an eye)

Perhaps most gratuitous and outrageous is the surgery scene where the evil doctor cuts open and extracts the internal organs from a female victim while she is still alive, then plops them on her chest. While the special effects are very good and realistic, did we REALLY have to see all of this in exacting detail to get the idea that this poor girl is having her organs removed without her consent, and is then thrown away like a sack of garbage?

My favorite useless and idiotic scenes are when the stranded tourists agree to follow an english speaking Brazilian through miles of jungle only to reach a picturesque waterfall and pool...and go swimming. These are the same people who have had their tour bus go over a cliff, have recently been drugged and robbed of all their possessions, and are desperate, supposedly, to find the police and a way to get back to civilization. Yep, if I were them, in their situation, I would stray from the main roads, hike deep into unchartered jungle with a guy I don't even know, and go swimming. Brilliant.

Second in my favorite idiotic plot sequences is the chase at the end through the underwater caves. Now put yourself into the shoes of the bad guys: you're kidnapping Western tourists and illegally removing their organs, killing them at the same time. Four of them escape from your clutches and run into the jungle. Okay, I might chase them a while, but once they start swimming around in underwater caves, what are the chances you're going to be able to recapture them? If they escape, do you really think they'll be able to find your secret liar again if they alert the authorities? Why not let them go and find new victims? Isn't following them into the underwater caves a bit foolhardy? Is it worth the effort?

As a brilliant villian, I know how you would answer these questions. Seeing how almost everyone in this movie is pretty stupid, you can guess what happens when the bad guys enter the caves.

As you can probably guess, Turistas is only a gore for the sake of gore movie. If all you want to do is watch a few scenes of excessive violence and grue, then please rent or buy Turistas. You can either fast forward the rest of the turgid movie or suffer through it, like I did. You've been warned.",1175212800,2,3421,4.464
2754219,2,B000N3AW6G,"This movie had basically the same storyline as Hostel, except more gore, possibly a tribute to the lines of Cannibal holocaust and such.  I'm not a gore fan, but I enjoyed hostel.  This movie was a complete ripoff of that one, and with no suspense or scares.  This was just anotyher generic exploitation flick.  The characters were 2 dimensional, only exisiting to be slaughtered, and let out the occasional yell, the story was trite, and the villain not believable.  I'm sorry I wasted my time.",1175126400,,495,4.776470588235294
2754220,1,B000N3AW6G,"Like almost every recent ""horror"" film that has lazily tried to ""update"" (read: just make more of the same only flashier and gorier) the ""teen slasher"" genre, this is another film that is just gore for gore's sake.  Of course, if you have heard any press for this film, or just take one look at the DVD box, you will realize this right off the bat.  I gave it a chance because I heard a few things about it being somewhat picturesque and exotic, both in its photography, locations, and scantily clad female cast members.  But there is not more of any of that than you find in most movies of this type (maybe even less, though, admittedly, the cast are a bunch of lookers), instead ""Turistas"" ratchets up the gore for the same group of indiscriminating movie-goers who seem to associate horror and scares with blood and shock value.  The more of this stuff I see, the less effective it is.

""Turistas"" is especially over the top, but not in a good, cool, or entertaining way.  Sometimes excessive violence can be done in either a stylish, entertaining way (""Kill Bill"") or in a disturbingly realistic, insiders-view way (pick a great war or mob film, or a hard-boiled cop drama).  Truly good horror movies are almost always considered such, and scarier, because psychological thrills are placed ahead of blood and guts (what's scarier, ""The Shining"" or ""Friday the 13th""?).  Here a chick falls off a cliff, cracks her head on the way down and goes splat right in front of the camera, a bad guy is stabbed in the eye with a shish kabob stick by an even badder guy who keeps pushing and grinding until the bad guy dies, some dude has a gaping wound in his head stapled shut (we are treated to viewing all 4 staples go in) and that is all before we get to the slice and dice surgeries that are the actual plot of this film.

Needless to say, none of this is scary, its all unpleasant, but not because it is disturbing, and it sure isn't cool or fun in a stylish, over the top sort of way; you just sortta shrug as if to say, ""What else did I expect?""  Every time I think one of these movies might be different, offer something original, or actually try to be scary and compelling rather than just go for gore, I am let down.  And I say that as someone who is a fan of horror movies.  Good horror movies.  Inventive, original ones.  At least something that is distinguishable from the last one like it.

Five years from now when someone mentions ""Turistas"" in the same breath as ""Wolf Creek,"" ""Hostel,"" ""Wrong Turn"" etc (far too many to list, but you get the idea), how many of us will remember which one is which?  I would include the recent ""Texas Chainsaw"" prequel/remake, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake and sequel, and the ""House of Wax"" remake from two years back in that list, but since they are remakes - and in the case of ""Wax,"" famous for killing off Paris Hilton - that alone will set them apart; but all these films are the same: a bunch of kids far away from home make bad decisions after finding themselves stranded in remote area where marauding killers just happen to be - falling down while being chased and running upstairs instead of out the door ensues.

Like all these misguided attempts, ""Turistas"" just wants to shock, as if we are going to give it points for trying to one up the disgusting quotient from the last film of its type.  If that is what you consider ""scary,"" then this movie is for you.

Oh, as if you couldn't guess, this movie is also amazingly dumb and predictable.  The plot not only is absurd, but you can see all the signs of where it is going right from the get go.  The script is constructed in such a fashion that all the dialog in the early going clues you in to what will happen in the rest of the movie.  If you've seen enough of these things, you'll know just what I'm talking about.  When I saw the tourist bus break down, I just couldn't believe that that even on a bus in Brazil the writers still found away to use the old standby of the broken down vehicle as a catalyst for all that will happen to the characters.  From there, almost every other clich is utilized.  It is really a pathetically predictable experience.

No need to be tourist for that kind of ride... again.",1174953600,4,4219,4.383825417201541
2754221,1,B000N3AW6G,"The torture-horror film is all the rage these days.  We've got the Saw and Hostel franchises, along with countless knock-offs to boot.  Director John Stockwell knows a thing or two about filming by the beach and ocean considering he's helmed previous films like Into the Blue and Blue Crush.  That's why the filming by said area looks so good, but that's about the only positive thing going for Turistas (funny how the torture-horror genre and said director make strange bedfellows huh?).  Josh Duhamel (soon to be seen in the live action Transformers movie) is among the group of unbelievably good looking young people who want to do nothing more than drink heavily and party in Brazil.  Little do they know that there are organ harvesters lurking around waiting for them to pass out, and they know nor care nothing for little things like anesthetics or legalities.  Turistas starts out as being incredibly boring before any substancial events happen, and after they do (such as when a few members of the party disappear, along with everyone's wallets, ID's, etc.) even more non-sensical events take place.  The acting is horrid, there are plot holes aplenty, and the gruesome acts themselves don't come off as anything really shocking or anything even remotely scary.  And by the time Turistas reaches it's climax, we just wonder what was the point of a horror film that's not even remotely scary.  We've seen this before, and we've seen this done much, much better.  Not even worth seeing for hardcore horror buffs.",1174780800,8,1518,4.940944881889764
2754222,3,B000N3AW6G,"I was suprised to find that this movie was pretty decent.  The cast of characters were unsurprisingly one dimensional with very little to go on, such as perhaps understanding any single motivation. The acting is strictly mediocre, with some gaping holes in plot and logic. Nonetheless the film held my attention and was far superior to some of it's peers of late.  The story itself is rather ludicrous, but looking past that, the arch of the film is interesting and the direction of the plot is somewhat unique in that it sets itself apart from its counterparts by breaking away from a few of the standard genre cliches.  I was impressed by the action sequences, and the film get's huge bonus points for the locales and general atmosphere.  I also of course love the fact that the movie is wonderful exploitative as far as making sweeping and hugely exagerated statements about Brazil and American tourists.  It reminded me of some of the better 70's exploitation film (mainly Italian cannibal fair) in that it offers up some gruesome deaths in gorgeous exotic settings and plays on stereotypes and urban lore, to maximum effect.  Not as smart as Hostel, but not as banal as Wolf Creek, this lands somewhere in the middle.",1170633600,28,1222,4.795238095238095
2754223,3,B000N3AW6G,"I loved John Stockwell when he was in 80's movies such as Christine, My Science Projects while he played clean cut all American kid.  Ironically, after 20 plus years, he now became well established fine director who made films such as Blue Crash and Into The Blue.  In newly released Turistas, I can see Stockwell tried to incorporate Blue Crash/Into the Blue success by showing his signature:  beautiful Ocean, beach, girls, and party to make this horror flick.  There are no Jason, Boogiemen in Turistas, but he proves that evil inside of human could be a lot worse than Jason or Boogiemen.  It does not contains much gorey scenes but Turistas proves that the less is more.  It surely gave me big chills that it would be happened to anyone if you run into wrong people at wrong place (people abduction for their vital organs taking away)  If you like Blue Crash and Into the Blue, and mood for horror, you would like Turistas.",1165276800,2,928,4.621951219512195
2754224,2,B000N3AW6G,"I'm sure that ""Turistas"" started out as a good idea, and it must have remained so at the start of the screenplay development process. Even in the final filmed version, parts of this good idea remained; it involves an isolated group of organ harvesters living in the deep jungles of Brazil. They obtain everything from unwitting tourists that wander into a phony beach/bar getaway. The notion that someone would remove your vital organs against your will is genuinely scary, and I have no doubt that such people actually exist, hidden away within the nooks and crannies of the earth. It's a very uncomfortable thought, and I give the film credit for making me second-guess any plans to visit Brazil.

But this film is loaded with problems, enough to outweigh the effectiveness of the underlying idea. ""Turistas"" is misguided practically from the start, missing the mark as both a horror film and a social commentary. The first hour does nothing but continuously build tension, which I suppose can be effective when constructed properly (consider Ridely Scott's ""Alien""). But by the time we actually get to the scarier moments of the remaining thirty minutes--moments highlighted by medical cruelty and violence--we come to the realization that there's hardly anything to have gotten tense about. I say this from a horror fan's point of view; if a story is meant to be scary, then it should remain consistently scary almost all throughout. Saving the shocking moments for the end simply does not work.

And then there are the turistas--or tourists in the native English. They're represented as a ragtag group of well-toned twenty-somethings from all walks of life. No matter how hard I tried to understand them, no matter how open-minded I made myself to their situations, I never once believed them to be genuine. They felt about as realistic and complex as clones from a cheaply produced 1990s teen slasher film (all of which were clones to begin with, I might add). The most important characters are the brother and sister duo of Alex (Josh Duhamel) and Bea (Olivia Wilde). Alex is inexplicably and unrealistically overprotective of Bea: she couldn't go to Brazil unless he went with her; she shouldn't put ice in her drinks because there's the risk of dysentery; she shouldn't have chosen a bus as a mode of transportation because their going through the mountains and the driver seems a bit reckless.

But as it turns out, the bus driver actually is reckless; in attempting to avoid hitting a group of people crossing the road, the bus violently swerves off the edge. Luckily, everyone manages to get out before the bus loses its balance and falls down a two hundred foot incline. Still, everything is ruined. With nothing left to wait around for, Alex, Bea, and a small group of people decide to try and find help. In their searching, they find a seemingly remote yet beautiful beach area, complete with a well-stocked bar and attractive girls (this is especially enticing for a pair of loud mouthed Londoners). For a few hours, everyone has a good time; they swim, they play volleyball, and they dance the night away to the sound of throbbing Brazilian dance music. And they drink. A lot.

What they don't yet realize is that every single drink from that little bar has been spiked with a powerful drug. Almost immediately, everyone passes out directly on the shoreline. When they wake up, they discover that they've been robbed, and worse yet, some of the other tourists are missing. Here is where the obligatory nightmare begins, most of which I found difficult to accept as plausible. For one thing, the only ""reliable"" source of help is Kiko (Agles Steib), a native Brazilian who speaks broken English. It's immediately obvious that in real life, no one, not even those in a desperate situation, would follow his lead. However, dimwitted characters in a substandard film certainly would. He first leads the group to a dilapidated village with no form of law enforcement (it's there that they see some of their missing items in the hands of the locals). No help there. Yet they keep following him, and he takes them through dense jungles and up steep mountains. He's supposedly leading them to his uncle's remote cabin; a place he claims will keep everyone safe.

But before they reach their destination, they stop at a picturesque waterfall area with underground caves just waiting to be explored. Thus begins a second scene of swimming, frolicking, and happiness. I'm sorry, but I thought these characters were supposed to be frightened, desperate, and in need of help. Why in God's name are they stopping to take a dip? There's one character in particular I wish had asked that question: her name is Pru (Melissa George), an Australian who frequently travels and speaks fluent Portuguese. I initially thought she had the most common sense, even more so than Alex. Someone of such mental clarity should be able to see how foolish it would be to stop in the middle of an important journey to have fun.

But I guess she's the wrong person to rely on. And like everyone else in the group, she has no idea what they're in for. They finally reach this deserted cabin, only to find it mysteriously filled with food, drugs, clothing, and medical supplies (you'd think they'd make use of them when Kiko accidentally splits his head open, but no; they use a staple gun). And then they meet Kiko's uncle, who majestically flies in by helicopter. He's a cold, cold man, and he's apparently tired of tourists draining Brazil of its resources (he shows his angry side early on by shoving a wooden skewer through his henchman's right eye). As payback, he kidnaps the tourists, drugs them, and surgically removes specific organs. This brings to light the social commentary mentioned earlier; if the nations of the world hope to earn one another's friendship, all the silly political squabbling needs to stop.

Can we all agree that that's an absolutely stupid message to put in a thriller, especially one involving some gory medical shots? I certainly hope we can. I won't bother with describing the climactic dissection scene, but I think it's safe for you to assume that you'll be in for some ugly visuals. I won't even bother with describing anymore of this film, something that only amounted to underachievement. I can appreciate the thought that went into ""Turistas""; I can tell that it was intended to be a horror film, and for a story of that genre, the idea definitely had potential. Unfortunately, its execution was handled badly. I left the theater feeling an unwelcome mixture of boredom, unpleasantness, and indifference. Who would actually want to watch this kind of filmmaking?
