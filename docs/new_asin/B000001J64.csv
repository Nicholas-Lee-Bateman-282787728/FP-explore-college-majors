1175967,3,B000001J64,"This was not what I expected. It is a new version where many of the old performers who were on the show in Lawrence's time reminisce and remember their times on the show while performing Christmas songs. I was hoping to have a lot more of Lawrence Welk in it. For this reason, I give it 3 stars - it's a bit misleading the way it is packaged.",1440115200,,342,4.044117647058823

It reminds me of the Christmas shows I saw as a kid, full of  beautiful Christmas music and the retelling of the Christmas story interspersed with favorite Christmas carols.  Today's television programming does not include Christmas shows like this anymore.  I am so glad I have this DVD to watch and enjoy each year.",1424304000,,337,4.758620689655173

1175983,5,B000001J64,"I bought this for my bedridden mother and she absolutely loved it! Lots of old fashioned Christmas carols with all the Welk favorites, set against scenic Christmas sets. A special treat as Bobby dances with his daughter! Plenty of sparkle! The DVD is one hour and 20 minutes long. I would highly recommend this video to anyone!",1408579200,2,327,4.754385964912281

My father passed many years ago and it is still difficult around holiday time. Mom doesn't remember a lot and is not interested in much, except music. This was a wonderful gift, and really lifted her spirits. She even sang along.",1404432000,3,340,4.328125

1175987,4,B000001J64,Ordered this for my little 92 year old friend who was watching VHS tapes he had recorded of old reruns. He absolutely loves this DVD and it is much easier to use and better quality than what he was watching. The only problem is that we had to turn the TV volume all the way up to hear it.,1390176000,,288,3.8983050847457625
1175988,5,B000001J64,"This was such a surprise.  I didn't realize that would be from the Welk Theater in Branson about the same time that we were there.

1175991,5,B000001J64,"As a child, we watched Lawrence Welk every Saturday evening- it was tradition.  I remember loving his Christmas programs because of the variety of good music, dance and overall talent.  This DVD brought back many fond memories.",1388880000,,227,5.108108108108108

1175994,5,B000001J64,"Its true its not everyone when they were alot younger, but what they looked like in the 90's; but its a great DVD. Brings alot of good memories just watching and listening to the Lennon Sisters, Guy, Norma, & the regular group of people that were on the show.  Going to buy another DVD by Lawrence Welk because this one was so good.",1363651200,,332,4.26984126984127
1175995,5,B000001J64,"I loved the nostalgia of seeing the Welk stars and their children each year.  This is particularly good Christmas show , probably one of the best of this holiday!",1362700800,,162,4.586206896551724

1175997,5,B000001J64,I like most of Lawrence Welk's shows.  This was nice to see because you got to see and hear the second generation of The Welk Show performers such as the Lennon daughters and sons sing.  Bobby Burgess danced with his daughter Wendi and Joe Feeney sang with his son Christopher Feeney and even the Lennon Brothers performed.  This taped performance was from 1995 and they all looked great!,1357776000,4,388,4.676470588235294
1175998,4,B000001J64,It is nice to sit back and watch how television used to be.  If you liked Mr. Welk's TV show then you will like this.  They move along quickly from song to song and there is a little commentary from some of the original cast members.  We enjoyed this item.,1311120000,,256,4.08
1175999,4,B000001J64,"The Color was great but it wasn't the same as the old days in Black and White and with Lawrence Welk in it himself with all people I remembered.
But it was entertaining",1297036800,,168,4.121212121212121
1176000,4,B000001J64,"I just read the review from Jamborlee and I must say he or she really had no right giving it a 1,I gave it a 4 strictly because length was only 80 minutes. For Jamorlee you should do what most people did and that is look at other sites like deepdiscountdvd,on there site they listed it as revival show,.Amazon can not expect to be perfect although they come close. Plus if your unhappy with the dvd amazon will take it back and refund your money,try that instead of giving the dvd a review of 1,thats not really fair.",1253664000,,517,4.285714285714286
1176001,5,B000001J64,"Couldn't be happier.  This DVD, filmed in Branson, was excellent.  All the familiar faces were there, and their voices, dancing, and music were just as strong as ever.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1228262400,5,203,4.911764705882353
1176002,2,B000001J64,"Sadly, Lawrence is now part of Christmas past but his family lives on! If you are a fan of the Lawrence Welk family and curious to see how they've aged -- this Dvd is for you. Old entertainers are like old athletes. Their best years are behind them. I'd label this product -- For Fans Only",1226448000,2,289,4.178571428571429
1176003,5,B000001J64,"THIS DVD WILL CURE THOSE HOLIDAY BLUES AND MAKE YOU SMILE. AN OLD FASHIONED MUSICAL CHRISTMAS WITH GREAT MUSIC, FABULOUS SINGERS, AND DANCERS. THIS ISN'T JUST ANOTHER MUSICAL PERFORMANCE. THIS SHOW WAS DESIGNED WITH WARMTH AND TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO LOVE WHAT THEY DO. IT IS A MUSICAL CELEBRATION OF LIFE AND THAT INDESCRIBABLE FEELING KNOWN AS ""THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT."" WE NEED MORE SHOWS LIKE THIS TODAY. MY FAMILY WATCHES THIS DVD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.",1198800000,4,454,5.148648648648648
1176004,1,B000001J64,"My wife bought this expecting to see a vintage Lawrence Welk Christmas Show and was disappointed to find upon viewing it that it was a 1995 show done in Branson, Missouri. It had almost no actual views of the old Welk show but rather a modern somewhat Welk-like reproduction. It did have some of the performers from that show but seeing more of those old shows would have been much better.

If you wish to view Lawrence Welk himself or his original shows, do not buy this DVD. That said, many of the songs and presentations were entertaining but most not up to the best of the old Welk shows.",1196467200,5,592,4.381818181818182
1176005,3,B000001J64,"I can't say it was anyone's fault in particular but let me keep others from making my mistake. At the time I bought this dvd from Amazon I do not believe it said anything about being a ""reunion concert.""

This is a 1995 reunion dvd rather than the actual Christmas show from yester-year. If you like that sort of thing that's cool, but for myself I purchased the dvd for more of a time period nostalgic purpose and was pretty disappointed.

For those who would like a better description, the back of the dvd says:

""In the 40 year holiday tradition of the Lawrence Welk Television Show, the musical family of stars gather at the Champagne Theatre in Branson, Missouri, for an all new Christmas Reunion Concert.""

Appearances by:

Norma Zimmer (Host)

Fern Welk (Lawrence's wife)

The Lennon Sisters- Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas

Jo Ann Castle- The Skater's Watz

Jack Imel- Winter Wonderland

Mary Lou Metzger & Ken Delo- White Christmas

Tom Netherton- The Most Wonderful Time of the Year

Bobby Burgess & Elaine Balden- Christmas Waltz & Jingle Bell Rock

Guy Hovis- Some Children See Him

Anacani- It Came Upon A Midnight Clear

Joe Feeney- O Holy Night & How Great Thou Art

The show was really boring to me but I couldn't drive myself to give it 1 star because I believe that fans of the show that grew up with the show would probably really enjoy it. I did give it a 3 because I felt it could have been described better than what it was at the time I bought it.",1172966400,68,1478,4.479400749063671
