6859164,5,B00Q6TAB9O,One of Robert Englund's best performances. Highly recommended.,1422748800,3,62,6.875
6859165,3,B00Q6TAB9O,"Dr. Andover (Freddy Krueger /Robert Englund) runs a fear clinic where people are put into an ""altered state"" device and are forced to face their fear, thereby eliminating it. He has been doing this for 20 years then suddenly the folks who were victims of a restaurant shooting are having a relapse. PLOT SPOILER: Fear is pissed.

The film uses the right amount of characters, develops things at a decent pace, and in the end becomes a confused mess with a heavy soundtrack. The problem I had was that when things happened...like the spider scene, I kept wondering how much was real or imagined. And so it was for much of the film as I entered into an altered state thinking about the film, without any mood altering substances to enjoy it.

Makes for a good rental.

6859166,5,B00Q6TAB9O,Robert Englund is great!!,1422662400,2,25,5.5
6859167,4,B00Q6TAB9O,"The film revolves around a shooting that takes place in a diner that traumatizes a group of survivors who check themselves into the Fear Clinic, a clinic run by Dr. Andover a man who has created a unique way of treating phobia's using a revolutionary new technology called the fear chamber. The fear chamber works by re-animating your worst fears into hallucinations so you can combat your fear face to face. However within the story the fears start manifesting themselves in the real world and this new technology that Dr. Andover has created is slowly opening up a doorway to allow fear incarnate to wreak havoc on the patients of the clinic.

Fear Clinic has an incredibly strong cast line up with Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm Street) reprising his role as Dr. Andover, Thomas Dekker (Heroes) as Blake, Fiona Dourif (Curse of Chucky) as Sara a survivor of the diner shooting, Angelina Armani (Chromeskull 2) as another survivor Caylee and Corey Taylor in his first ever acting role as Bauer a porter at the clinic. Joining this stellar cast are a whole host of other amazing talent including Brandon Beemer, Cleopatra Coleman, Kevin Gage and Felisha Tirrell.

The movie as a whole was incredibly strong, what started off as an incredibly slow build up actually built the story up rather nicely and gave us some in depth character building and information, it is rare to see a good character build in indy horrors but Fear Clinic did it maybe even too much at times. Either way the second half of the movie eclipses the first by a long shot, once the story is set the action begins and with Bob Kurtzman and Steve Johnson behind the SPFX team the excitement and effects do not disappoint. As fear incarnate slowly starts to develop in the real world the SPFX team has amazingly brought this character to life taking on a persona that was unsettling to watch (Minus the visable bald cap on Robert Englund's head). The intro to the movie however slow always had a creepy and uncomfortable vibe, almost putting you in the clinic itself, testing your nerves, straining your ability to relax and always putting you on edge for what is about to come. It was a great touch and full credit to the team for drawing it out over the films duration without letting go of that emotion.

The film contains deep undertones and emotional depth in terms of people's fears and phobia's but there are some points within the movie that need to be tightened up a bit. Certain scenes need explaining more and as fear incarnate starts to manifest itself the build up and gore is lacking within the story so even thou the creature looks amazing, it doesn't strike fear into the audience which is a shame as now the audience is isolated from the story. Never the less the movie flows nicely and as it stands its a great introduction to a franchise but it does feels quite rushed in places and action is scarce in places as the build up is painstakingly drawn out,  hopefully this is tightened up for the DVD release version or Director's cut.

Convoluted in places but a movie that stands higher than most Horror's that are being released at the present, a new generation of cerebral Horror. A movie that will make you think rather than spaced out watching the screen, a movie that when finished you'll rewind to make the jigsaw pieces fit. A very smart movie.

If you're used to watching Horror movies with a vacant mind then you will be disappointed with Fear Clinic, it's time to engage your brain, the Fear Clinic is open for business.

The movie stands alone, some will understand it and some just simply will not but the better this movie does, the more improvements that can be made in its inevitable sequel with some key plot holes to be addressed.

6859184,4,B00Q6TAB9O,"""Fear Clinic"" taps into those over-the-top, fantasy subjects such as tapping into our fear through science to face and overcome phobias, only to learn that fear has a form, an appetite, and fear bleeds black. It is all similar to classic philosophical tropes like ""Dreamscape"", ""The Cell"", and ""Nightmare On Elm Street"". Although here things are more H.P. Lovecraft than Wes Craven. The story is a nice, exciting nightmare scenario that gives us the classic characters, a creeping, eccentric doctor, and some 'out of this world' experimental technology.

The evil, or ultimate antagonist in ""Fear Clinic"" is unhinged demonic energy that is black, oozy, gluttonous, and terrifying. The cast give decent enough performances and the dialog is delivered nicely. Some of the scenes with character development seem more staged for theatrical purposes than for the sake of the story, but again, it all is keeping with those more, over-the-top, fantasy horror films of the 80's.

The special effects are stellar. The CGI and practical effects mix perfectly to create chilling and creepy scenes that are entertaining, Some of the shock moments fall flat but there are a few that build intense, suspenseful moments, and give good, chilling scares. The sound effects and musical score offer cool, chilling atmosphere and keep the energy dark, and ominous. I really didn't find much wrong with the special effects or creature design. Some scenes go a bit overboard with the theatrics but ""Fear Clinic"" is fully committed to playing with surrealism concepts.

Overall ""Fear Clinic"" is a cool modern horror than hearkens back to 80's VHS heydays. I thought some of the staging and conceptual scenes were a bit too much, but I liked that every moment was well thought out as far as creating visual, artistic fantasy moments from the point of view of fear and horror. The evil, or creature is creepy, Lovecraftian, and one that I would definitely fight to wake up from if I found it entering my fear chamber session. ""Fear Clinic"" doesn't really deal in dreams but the horror, and nightmare situations it gives us are the dreams of demons, and they dream of feeding on our fears!",1445299200,3,2163,5.002777777777778

But I was very impress that the movie has some decent scare in it and there were moments that it got under my skin.  I think they did a pretty good job with what they had to  work with.  The story was decent and sometimes simple sound and lighting provides good scary atmosphere.  I would definitely watch it again.",1430956800,,625,4.282051282051282
6859197,2,B00Q6TAB9O,"Perhaps if I had seen the tv series this was based off of, it might have had me more interested in this rather dull and boring movie. Then again it could be from being fooled by the reviews and ratings this things gotten, from what I suspect is die-hard Robert Englund fans who would probably rate anything he does as a top score A+ movie even if it was him filming himself on the can after a long night out at Taco Bell.

I just don't get this one. It was really slow, boring, and the overall story was not that interesting. It's all about a doctors invention to somehow help people get over their phobias by making them face it in a hallucinogenic state while the doc guides them through. Kind of like learning to control your dreams to face you fears. However a couple of patients relapse and the hallucinations start again, which by the films law, isn't supposed to ever happen. So the story follows one of the former patients who was traumatized by something and is relapsing so she has to seek out the doctor who has began to see his precious treatment is not 100% successful after all... and becoming fatal.

So, there is a plot. However I guess it all comes down to whether or not that plot sounds interesting to you? I do love England as Freddy and have enjoyed his work in other films, but as of late there seems to be some kind of trending follow with him and some of his fans, and it makes me wonder if what I said just a moment ago is the case here, or if I just didn't particularly like this one for my own reasons.

For me it had a slow pace, not very interesting characters, no one I could care less about, no fun gore, no horror style humor, just a bunch of things repeated too much, and overall not very thrilling either. Certainly not the worst film I've ever seen tho, the acting is OK, the filming, editing and score are all fine... it's just the overall story I found pretty disappointing and uneventful.",1430870400,,1926,4.300275482093664

6859200,4,B00Q6TAB9O,"FEAR CLINIC

For those who saw the web series of the same name you should know this was intended as a standalone story and thus far is different. Some the cast returns but not everyone but that is to be expected. The film is directed and co written by Robert Hall who made the series and also the Laid to Rest films. His writing partner from the series returns to help with writing and producing duties, Aaron Drane.

The story follows a doctor [Englund] who had major success with curing peoples phobias with a machine he had created. But after a mistake with one patient he has stopped treating people and went into a depression. That is until some of his patients return to the clinic needing his help once again. But something evil is lurking in its halls, maybe even fear itself.

This was a really good film that played out well and touches on everything you would want from it, but it falls just a little short of classic. The writing and direction works fine and the story is a fun one, the different fears and such. The acting is good for the most part, there were a few that seemed a little off. Of course Robert Englund as the good doctor is excellent here and I also thought that Thomas Dekker was great as well here.

The look and feel of this film is excellent and may be the best thing about this flick. The fear charter here feels right at home in this setting and that adds to the mood and fun of the movie. The DVD comes with a behind the scenes look and the making of the film from the series. It is a cool little look at it but I wish there would have been a commentary. I say that all the time I know but they are my favorite thing about special features. Any way over all this is a good little horror flick that has some real potential with the whole exploring peoples fears and phobias, I would like to see a second film.",1428710400,,1844,4.215297450424929
6859201,5,B00Q6TAB9O,Great movie.,1428624000,,12,5.5
6859202,3,B00Q6TAB9O,"Ive been a fan of Robert Englund for some time, even before he made himself famous as Freddy Krueger. Im talking back to his first film BUSTER AND BILLIE (when will someone finally release that to DVD?) There are some that will not give him his due having been the star of a horror franchise, but the fact is the man can act and do it well (see THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA for proof). So why won't someone give him the chance? He even elevates this film in moments but he cant save it on his own.

Englund plays Dr. Andover, a psychiatrist who ran a clinic that used a new invention he created to help people overcome their distinctive phobias. But something happened along the way and he shut down the program after several patients were cured and left. Now those patients are having problems dealing with those phobias they once thought they were cured of. Theyre returning to the clinic one at a time with the hope that he will cure them all over again. But that is not to be.

While the test group has faith in the doctor and all he achieved, something happened with one of those patients that made him close down the program but not the facility. When one of these patients has a terrible incident he decides to try again but without the success he had in the past. As a matter of fact something has happened while using the machine that has caused a totally unwanted result that may end up killing them all. Only the phobic patients and the doctor working together can achieve the outcome they seek.

So this movie plays out okay but in the end leaves much to be desired. The idea of the machine that gives the doctor the chance to enter the minds of his patients somewhat is a neat concept that could have turned out much better. But there are a number of clichs that fill out the time on this movie that make it take a turn for the worse. Uncaring and corruptible orderlies have become the norm in horror films. Its about time that real orderlies formed a union and took movie makers to task for this portrayal of people who work hard for no pay and no recognition.

The special effects on display aren't bad but they aren't stellar either. They get the job done but nothing stand out in my mind as worth mentioning now that Im writing after watching the movie. The acting by the main characters isn't bad but like the special effects none are noteworthy.

The movie apparently was based on a web series and it shows. While that might have taken short moments to unreel a story that could be watched on a weekly basis, putting them together to form an entire film just doesnt work. Englund played the same role in that series and honestly hes the best thing on display in this movie. Where some would handle the part with camp, Englund actually makes his character seem like a doctor who truly cares for his patients and wants what is best for them. But like I said earlier, he cant carry the entire movie alone.

Ive often wondered what would happen if someone along the lines of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola or Guy Ritchie were to take Englund and put him in a major role how it might elevate his status in Hollywood. I think he could bring acting skill to any role they gave him that would surprise most. If only someone would be willing to take that chance then perhaps we would see him in movies that were more deserving of his abilities. Until then well just have to enjoy him in parts like this, making the most of a bad movie and raising it a star or two on the rating scale.",1428537600,,3515,4.358778625954199
6859203,5,B00Q6TAB9O,"New Anchor Bay release, ""Fear Clinic"" is an unexpected thrill ride
that's fun at every turn. It's a low budget horror film ..That doesn't
know its low budget.

""Fear Clinic"" is loosely based on the 2009 fearnet.com web series of
the same name. It stars Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm Street,
Wishmaster, Urban Legend). The story follows Englunds Dr. Andover who's
created a device that attempts to cure people of their worst fears. (Of course, no horror film would be worth its weight without
something going horribly wrong.)

The films stand out is Englund himself. Being a horror icon, you'd
probably expect a phoned in, overzealous, scenery chewing performance.
But that is just not true. He gives a vulnerable, emotional,
unguarded and in the end, heart wrenching performance, that's by far,
distanced from any other (sans make-up) character he's ever played. To
his credit, Englund has little dialogue and utilizes his screen time
speaking a thousand words, exuding recognizable emotion with just his
eyes: A rarity now a days with all the You Tube instant celeb
mediocrity regurgitated daily. It's a trick that only a seasoned actor
of Englund's stature can convey.

Englund's Andover is a Doctor who truly believes he can help mankind.
He becomes so emotionally involved, that he himself is, ultimately
corrupted by the same evil force he's trying to cure.

Another stand out is actor Thomas Dekker. Dekker is best known for
playing a young John Conner in the short lived ""Terminator: The Sarah
Connor Chronicles"". Dekker, a veteran of "".Clinic"" director Robert
Hall's (Laid to Rest), here plays a wheel chair bound Blake,
incapacitated and unable to speak. Dekker could have thrown on the
cheese and played the character with reckless clich : Instead, he's
fearless here, walking a fine tightrope, inviting us in to share his
characters tortured past, peeled back in delicate layers, all leading
to a third act twist I defy you to see coming. This is Dekker's best
work since playing Smith, the ""Chosen Son"" in the Canne', Palm Award
winning film, ""Kaboom"" by director Gregg Araki.

Other cast stand outs include level headed Sara, played by Fiona
Dourif, phobic crippled Megan, played with relish by Cleopatra Coleman, as well as worthy cast member and reluctant victim of Dr. Andover's
device, the deliciously devious, possessed Paige, embodied with zeal by
Bonnie Morgan (and helped by an outstanding special effects team): All,
rising stars waiting to happen. Rounding out the cast are the horror
film, ""comedy relief staples"", personified with glee by Kevin Gage and
Corey Taylor.

Director Robert Hall, whose original web series the film
is based on, returns here, showing his chops by leading his cast down a road of atypical mayhem. The director could have ridden a murder every 30 minute wave that most low budgeters settle for. Instead, he doubles down on the phobias and in turn, with the help of dynamic camera work by Cinematographer, Joseph White and interesting editing choices by
Sherwood Jones, the film takes us on a ride with peaks and valleys that are fun and solidly different.

 If I had to make one critical call I'd have to say my only regret was the over use of colored lighting gels that at times,
bordered on annoying. But, if that's the worst thing that happened while viewing ""Fear Clinic', I'm in pretty good shape.

If you're looking for seen it before, duplicated dreck, check out
""Michael Myers: Part 15"" or ""Jason Voorhees: Part 18"". But, if you want
to see an unexpectedly original horror franchise villain, waiting to
exploit endless possibilities of fear in the human mind, step out of
your huge budget comfort zone. Take a leap of faith and give over to
the delicate moments of horror fun. Then, watch it again and discover
what new interpretations can be discovered in this low budget
horror/thriller with each subsequent viewing.

6859211,4,B00Q6TAB9O,"Anchor Bay gives fans of Robert Englund another impressive movie to add to their collection with Fear Clinic. Based on the renowned web series, the concept carries over to a feature length film magnificently. I was first exposed to the excellent talent of filmmaker Robert Hall at a screening of his new slasher classic Laid to Rest. With his latest endeavor in terror, he far surpasses that simple, yet genre-bending work of art.

In Fear Clinic, five people with incurable phobias seek treatment in a machine that animates their fears. Unbeknownst to them, the machine's operator harbors an entity which feeds on terror.

Robert Englund proves once again that his acting abilities stretch much further than what many expect from the man who created the character of Freddy Krueger in one of the most popular horror franchises in the cinema history. His role in Fear Clinic dares the audience to not have sympathy for him as he strives to rescue the human race from the terrors they suffer from. The rest of the cast are visibly invested in their parts as well.

Fear Clinic is rated R for bloody horror violence, disturbing images, language and some sexuality/nudity. Many of the dream sequences and flashbacks feature hallucinatory cinematography and choppy editing that give the viewer a sense of anxiety. Its nowhere near as graphic and gory as the Laid to Rest movies.

The only special feature included for the Fear Clinic Blu-ray is a making of featurette entitled 'Fear Clinic:' Behind the Scenes. It includes cast and crew interviews mixed with footage of the shooting of the movie. The extra is around 11 minutes long and delves into the transition from web series to full length film and more.

Robert Hall has given horror fans a unique and engaging journey into the heart of our most dreaded nightmares. Its hard to compare Fear Clinic to any other movies out there. Imagine the artful abstract imagery from The Cell blended with a Lovecraftian creature feature and youll halfway have an idea of what to expect. It also uses a familiar scenario which is becoming disturbingly more and more commonplace as its foundation.",1425859200,8,2134,4.916666666666667

This film though, took this concept to a very odd level. Admittedly, I never watched the show, but now I'm very curious. Seeing Robert Englund doing different roles from Freddy Kruger, wasn't a bad move for him: this wasn't his first, either. I know fear can be like a disease or a plague, but here's the tricky part,  not letting it consume you. Although it can also save your life under the right circumstances. Obviously, this film will have some bone chilling scenes with certain viewers, it is called Fear Clinic after all, but take some precautions as well.

6859221,5,B00Q6TAB9O,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I had the pleasure of meeting actor Robert Englund a couple of years ago, and I have to say, he is a real class act.  Aside from being a brilliant actor and a horror icon, he is a heck of a nice guy and very down to earth.  Therefore, when I heard he was teaming up with another horror legend, Robert Hall, for FEAR CLINIC, the film instantly became a must-see for me.  Halls LAID TO REST series is one of my favorite horror franchises, so to see him team up with Englund a.k.a. Freddy Krueger, made my mouth water.  And just like I knew they would, Hall and Englund deliver a first rate horror flick, chocked full of intensity and scares.

First off, this film is not what I was expecting.  Its dark and visceral, with a plot that is surprising and inventive.  I was literally enthralled from the start, and I was riveted throughout the whole thing.  I cant remember the last time I was this engrossed in a horror flick.

FEAR CLINIC is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The cinematography does an excellent job of helping to capture the desolate atmosphere of the clinic.  The ambient sounds also add volumes to the air of eeriness.  These combined make for a truly chilling movie experience.

As expected, the acting is perfect.  Englund gives a mesmerizing performance as Dr. Andover, while Thomas Dekker (another one of my favorite horror actors) stuns as Blake, a disabled young man suffering from a gunshot wound.  The rest of the cast is stellar as well, and I have to give special props to Fiona Dourif, the daughter of screen legend Brad Dourif; she does a masterful job as Sara.  I hope to see much more of her onscreen in the future.

Also, the special effects in FEAR CLINIC are great as well.  Theres some CG, which looks pretty good, but the practical effects are always the winners for me.  I particularly like the look and design of the Fear Chamber.  This thing is terrifying by itself, with its face-like view plate and formidable design.  Whoever thought this thing up deserves an award!

FEAR CLINIC is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it to every fan of horror.  Its got just about everything a horror fan would want:  unique plot, inventive special effects, and gruesome deaths.  Horror flicks don't get much better than this.  It is available now, so give it a look.",1424131200,10,2378,4.4953271028037385
6859222,3,B00Q6TAB9O,"Fear Clinic has a lot going for it.  The film has a solid cast who give their all. Robert Englund, Fiona Dourif and Thomas Dekker all turn in great performances, and they are helped by a script that has solid, well written dialogue.  The film looks great, opting for a saturated, colorful look reminiscent of old school Argento.  The practical effects are spot on, ride the line between freaky and goofy perfectly, giving the film a solid, old school monster movie feel.  The effects do slip up a bit when they switch to CG, but those moments are very rare.  These are the reasons I'm giving the film three stars.  With acting this strong, and slick visuals to match, there is a lot to appreciate in this film.

So, if the movie has so many positives why doesn't it work? The basic plot is actually pretty interesting.  Several survivors from a massacre in a diner return to the Clinic one year after their last treatments.  It seems that their treatments are no longer working, and their fear is overtaking them again.  Obviously there is some nefarious force behind this sudden regression.  I am not being vague as to avoid spoilers.  I'm being vague because the ""what"" is never fully fleshed out.  While the core idea of the story is interesting, the film is overloaded with characters, most of which get lost in the shuffle once the hectic, fast paced finale kicks into gear.  The script, while solid, needed a lot of trimming.  Instead of focusing on a small, core group, the film continues to add new characters well into the middle act, bloating the cast, and diverting attention from the stories that really need to be told. Without focus, and with budget limitations, the ending becomes a non-sensicle mess, killing off any good will it built from its much stronger first half. The rushed pace of the ending also doesn't help, as the film tries to quickly tie up as many loose ends as possible, and sadly, disappoints on almost every single one of them.

While there are some serious flaws within the movie, it is not unenjoyable, just disappointing, especially when a low budget feature has such a strong cast and creative team behind it giving it their all.  A missed opportunity.",1424044800,3,2191,4.678851174934726
6859223,1,B00Q6TAB9O,"I would give this zero stars if possible. A mish mash of a movie that wastes the talents of Robert Englund, Thomas Dekker, and everybody else in this film.  Based upon a website series (which I never saw), Fear Clinic involves trying to cure people of their phobias. The movie is so disjointed and shifts back and forth so frequently that you are never sure what is real, what is hallucination, what is the phobia, and do you really care.  In the Special Features section, the cast, the writer, and the director are so proud of their accomplishment.  Well - bully bully for them.  If you present  garbage as something profound, I guess the hope is that the audience will be so overwhelmed with rhetoric that they'll buy it. The special effects are only confusing; and, in the end, I didn't even know what some of the phobias were and why some of the characters reacted the way they did.
Things start with Englund as a doctor who presides over phobia cures but feels that he cannot do it anymore because of the death of one of his patients.  After a quick cutaway to a diner where most of our cast are dining, a masked gun toting man dressed all in black suddenly appears and starts shooting people in an indiscriminatory manner. Is this real?  Is it someone's hallucinatory nightmare?  Will the Cubs ever get into a World Series again? Was the Moon landing a fraud? That sums up the relevance and clarity of what just happened. And from that situation all else devolves. No point in going on since I don't want to give away any ""Spoilers"", though I doubt that I could since I don't know what would be ""spoiled"".
With all that being said, when it comes to this Fear Clinic ""abandon hope all ye who enter here"".",1423785600,4,1709,4.472668810289389
6859224,5,B00Q6TAB9O,Loved this flick!  Perfectly creeptastic!,1423440000,3,41,7.2
6859225,3,B00Q6TAB9O,"I'll admit that I had some high hopes for this film since I'd enjoyed the FearNet web series and I was overjoyed when I found that it was still getting made despite Chiller taking over FearNet and then essentially proceeding to wipe it off the face of the earth. However this end result is a little disjointed, which I think is a result of this project having so many stops and starts along the way.

The good thing is that you can still watch this if you haven't seen the previous web series and I might actually recommend that you not, as the web series is almost a completely different beast at times. The character of Dr. Andover (Englund's character) is almost completely different in his motivations here, as in the web series he was pretty gung-ho on the treatments *continuing* despite weird stuff happening, whereas here he's against this from the start of the film. They give somewhat of an explanation for this in the film, but it's such a change in character that it's a little jarring at points. Still, Englund is one of those actors that could read a phone book and still give a great performance, so he manages to pull this off. Plus if you're one of the people who wanted to see what he looked like in the buff, you're in luck.

The downfall of this is that the continuous delays in production kind of hit this film hard at points. Everyone works pretty hard in this film and you can tell it's a labor of love for everyone involved, but I can't quite shake the feeling that they had to cut out a lot story-wise because they didn't have the time or money to film the sequences. The special effects here are pretty good so I'm not zinging that- it's just that there are a lot of spots in this film that just sort of tread water at best and there were a lot of places where I wanted to know more about some of the bits that were brought up and quickly dismissed, like Andover's creation of the machine. I wouldn't have minded learning a bit more about Paige and her death as well.

Still, this is a pretty entertaining film and considering all of the limitations and setbacks it had, it's pretty good. It's just that this is probably something that you'd be better off catching once it hits cable or renting via one of the various outlets as opposed to purchasing it straight away. Some of you will undoubtedly want to own this and I can see where they'll be coming from, but rent this first.",1423180800,,2405,4.387892376681615
6859226,5,B00Q6TAB9O,Great movie!,1422835200,3,12,5.5
6859227,2,B00Q6TAB9O,"Man, what a letdown! Honestly, this movie has a great premise, but the execution was BEYOND terrible! I was expecting a movie with a lot of fears to overcome, instead I received a film about a shooting spree inside some diner?!

Apparently this movie was based off a TV ""series"" of the same name. I'd never heard of it, but I might actually check it out. It sure can't be worse than this?! Dr. Andover (Robert Englund) has created a machine that takes a person's fears and transforms them into controlled hallucinations. Apparently this is supposed to help the patient overcome their fear and allow them to continue living their lives without being held back. Problem is, EVERY patient is suffering from the same ""fear"". They were all involved in a shooting spree inside a small town diner. Not exactly a ""fear"", as much as a tragic memory. Months after receiving treatment, several of the patients fears begins to return forcing them back to the clinic and into Dr. Andover's care.

The acting is REALLY bad! Thomas Dekker continues to get acting roles,...I have no idea how, but this guy just can't act. On top of that, Corey Taylor (Slipknot, Stone Sour) makes an appearance of his own. Oddly enough, even with his bad acting, I was still entertained. Robert Englund is the exception, obviously. He does a phenomenal job as one would expect. It's just unfortunate, it's overshadowed by the rest of the cast.

Final Verdict: Don't waste your time! This movie will be PERFECT for the Chiller network, but that's all.",1422835200,2,1517,4.760456273764259

I would like to see a film for a good story/plot not to be just wowed by the special effects. The story itself was unique really enjoyed it. I believe all of us could relate in one way or another.
