Idol's band is awesome...Top notch performers all around...Sadly though only half of the setlist was included in the setlist, the show was actually 2 1/2 hours long not measly 75 minutes...I wanted to see more and more..Great live concert well worth the price...",1261180800,15,348,4.915254237288136

3958650,3,B002N7W3PS,"hey mike - do you even know billy idol's song catalog ? G Peck is correct; there are several great hits missing from this performance dvd. perhaps they were left off on purpose and will be included later in an expanded more expensive version like they always do now with classics cd works of various artists.
  this is still very entertaining and billy has sure aged well over the last 20-25 years. i would wait and hope for a more expanded product before purchasing - and try to dvr or tivo the pbs version instead.

3958651,5,B002N7W3PS,Who Ever Said The New Sound Stage DVD Sucks Cause Their Are Songs Missing!! Watch The Thing!!! I Don't Think Anything Is Missing. It's The Best Dam Live Concert I've Seen This Holliday Season!,1259884800,4,192,4.676470588235294
3958652,4,B002N7W3PS,"I first saw this performance on the PBS series Soundstage and was completely blown away.  Billy sounds better than ever and has incredible energy and charisma.  The band are phenomenal too, especially Steve Stevens on guitar.  The concert was filmed in high definition so this blu-ray should look and sound superb.  This release contains three additional songs that were not shown on PBS.

The one huge problem is that several of my favorite Billy Idol songs are not included.  ""Hot in the City,"" ""To Be a Lover,"" ""Sweet Sixteen,"" ""Mony Mony"" and ""Cradle of Love"" were all performed the night this show was recorded but were left off!  Here is the track list:

Super Overdrive
Dancing With Myself
Flesh for Fantasy
Touch my Love
White Wedding
Scream
Eyes Without a Face
Cry
Blue Highway
Ready Steady Go
Rebel Yell
Kiss me Deadly",1254787200,52,828,4.78169014084507
