804775,3,6304167725,"It probably would have helped if I'd seen all (or at least some) of the movies that this parodies, but as it stands, DON'T BE A MENACE is consistently funny enough on its own. From the Wayans' Brothers, DON'T BE A MENACE parodies/spoofs just about every ""hood"" movie from the 90's, like BOYZ N THE HOOD, MENACE 2 SOCIETY, etc. Shawn Wayans stars as Ashtray, a 19-year-old who moves in with his younger (than him) father, and Marlon Wayans as Loc Dog, one of his friends. If there's one big weakness, it's that there's not really a plot to speak of, meaning that the film plays like a series of skits rather than a cohesive story. That being said, there were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments and funny running gags. The best ones, to me, were Keenen Ivory Wayans as the mailman who pops up from time to time and says ""Message!"" whenever the ""preachy"" moments come. Also, everyone (and I mean everyone) drinks only malt liquor. Generally, the humor that works the best has to do with pointing out stereotypes in these types of movies (and life in general), rather than the scatological stuff which was often a little too gross for me. Thankfully, it wasn't relied upon as much as it is now in movies of this ilk, but fart jokes and foul-mouthed grannies will only get you so far. For those types of jokes, they were funny the first few times, but became a little tiresome later. This is also an extremely quotable movie, with such memorable lines as, ""Break yo self, fool!"" So, while I haven't seen really any of the movies this parodied, I have seen other Wayans' Brothers movies and this compares favorably to those. I'd consider this the last genuinely good spoof from them, even if the story structure is all but nonexistent. It doesn't really live up to Mel Brooks (but honestly, what can?), but as a distillation of 90's urban movie clichs, DON'T BE A MENACE is on fairly solid ground.",1455408000,3,1888,4.555882352941176

Spoiler Alert

an example.of newly discovered things:

When Ashtray is dropped off at his dads in a moment in parody of Boyz n' The Hood, he is greated by his younger-than-him father. Throughout the scene, you can see plastic on everything on the house. The stove, the tv, the weight lifting set, shelves, furniture, etc. Absolutely hilarious.

Also, keep an eye out for after they get Crazy Legs and to go to a party. While they are walking toward camera and entering the backyard from the side of the home, pay attention to the banner that is backwards to the camera and read it. I almost peed a bit. Could not stop laughing. After hundreds of views, when I think I know everything about the film and the hidden queues and messages, I see it in hd for the first time and since childhood and am blown away by the subtle or hidden things that are revealed. This movie is loaded. You certainly had to be alive and aware through the 90's to relate to humor at the fullest.",1438992000,,1243,4.414847161572053

Moronic, racist, tasteless, stupid, depraved, and beneath contempt don't begin to describe this movie.  I expect this kind of garbage from childish sell-outs like Marlon and Shawn, but I was genuinely surprised that the talented Keenen would produce such truly awful trash.  I commend Damon for not being associated with this patently evil disservice to black Americans. This film might be funny on some crude, base level if the social pathologies depicted in it were a thing of the past, but as they continue to plague this country unabated, the picture is, therefore, a genuine travesty. If white people had produced this thing, it would never have been allowed to see the light of day. This movie's Internet circulation comes at particularly bad time for black Americans, especially since there is now a full court press to retrench American racism as a backlash to Barack Obama's two election victories. The Ku Klux Klan could not have made a better propaganda film indicting modern black Americans.  If a member of the jaded producer's family were killed by a stray bullet while walking in a black neighborHOOD, then he and this film's ""stars"" might wake up and realize how really sick this production is.

Basically, this is a series of skits very loosely constructed into a plot that is a parody of the ghettocentric black films of the early 90s (some of which were so ridiculous and self righteous that they were just waiting to be satirized). Enjoying it requires some familiarity with the plots of those movies. The Wayans clan is involved, so that should tell you something about the brand of humor here.

If you are of the ultra sensitive politically correct sense-of-humor deprived school of individuals who cannot watch a movie without trying to analyze it for a deeper meaning and believes that every depiction African Americans short of The Cosby Show is a negative stereotype, either get some nitroglycerin pills before watching this or avoid it like the plague (especially the ""Elijah Muhammad Ali"" character, Helen Martin's profanity -spouting weed smoking predecessor to Madea, the boy being only a year younger than his daddy, The girlfriend's children asking her date in unison ""are your our daddy,"" et. al). Don't expect any NAACP image awards for this one.

I would recommend this for a non-PC group of friends watching this with beer(or perhaps 40z bottles of malt liquor) and pizza on a weekend night. In short, don't take it too seriously, leave your brains at the door, and you may find it funny.",1368835200,,1415,4.838842975206612

Now, I've purchased it on VHS, then upgraded to the bare bones DVD and the Unrated Collector's Edition DVD. When I saw it was on Blu Ray, I wanted it.. The picture is slightly better than the Unrated DVD and it has all the same bonus features + a music video..BUT, even though the Blu Ray is dubbing itself as the director's cut, it's the theatrical version which clocks in at 89 minutes..hence the original R-Rating . The Blu Ray cover lists it with a running time of 95 min, which is the unrated version's running time... More confusing, the Miramax Unrated DVD (released around 2007)indicates it's running time is 89 minutes, when it's really 94 minutes. Needless to say, if you have the Unrated Miramax DVD, don't bother upgrading to the Echobridge version, it's just the theatrical version with the unrated version's special features..

Great movie either way. Btw, I do applaud EB for making an effort to include special features, considering they're a budget label not known for bells and whistles.. Who knows, maybe the people that now own Miramax (it's not Disney) now demanded the inclusion.. However, these companies need to be a bit more diligent when they release products.. it's their job to give accurate descriptions about their products and features, so as to avoid class action law suits and recalls.. It's pretty sad when they say features and included and they aren't or post confusing info just in hopes to get an extra buck or two out of anxious collectors....I'm just sayin'...",1366761600,,1714,4.767676767676767

Anyone, black, white, purple, can enjoy this movie as long as you're not looking for perfection and don't mind dumbing-down (stoned) a little bit. A couple more things to look for...the 20-bag hanging from Loc Dog's hair, the two grandmas having a dance-off, Ashtray's poetic line, ""who needs foreplay when you're jacking-off?"" and a bystander's line at the very end of the movie when he walks up to grandma and says, ""Hey grandma, you've got the juice now.""

With that being said, DBAM (just shortening the title) borrows a bit from different flicks but does not steal complete scenes from what it parodies. It also takes typical black stereotypes and elevates them to a whole new level, making the stereotypes totally absurd and over-the-top.

The Wayans brothers are great comic leads in this film. Shawn plays the do-gooder who escaped the ways of the hood, while Marlon plays the quick-triggered thug who can't decide if he wants to wear sneakers or bunny slippers. The supporting cast adds plenty of laughs in this farce about hood life.

Even tho I haven't seen anything it's parodying, I still give it 4 stars for being funny as hell.

The Wayans brothers deliver another great comedy like Scary Movie, and this one is definitely better then White Chicks and that baby one with the midget.

It's just hilarious to see them poke fun at hood fashion, lifestyles, and gang wars. It's refreshing to see a cast of African Americans not afraid to poke fun at themselves and deliver some classic comedy moments.

It's like Scary Movie, it's not a family comedy, unless you're the Osbourne's. But it's a highly recommended must see DVD.

the clean good lookin' boy moves to the hood and wants to make something of himself to get out of the hood, along the way he is mixed up with his cousin who is ""spethshall"" and all there goofball homies.

808699,3,6304167725,"Don't Be A Menace Spoofs many well known African-American movies including Menace II Society, Boyz 'N The Hood, South Central, Higher Learning, Jason's Lyric amd Juice. The comedy is raw and well acted by the cast. The story revolves around the character Ash Tray (Shawn Wayans), taken out of Cuba Gooding's Trey persona in Boyz 'N The Hood. Ash Tray returns to his old neighborhood of South Central to live with his father for good after being dropped off by his mother (Vivica A. Fox), who plays a small part. From there, Tray lives with his father, who ironically looks more like a small brother. He gives Tray bad advice of how to get on in the ghetto but Tray sees other ways and claims to leave the ill-sighted hood for good. He then ventures over to his cousin De Loc (Marlon Wayans) and both decide to go on an adventure in the hood. Along the way, they end up in wacky yet comic situations such as the Korean Store, the Bank and the public cookouts.

There are many characters taken out of the famed movies of the late 90s including Trech's character in Jason's Lyric played in this movie as the centre villian. The plots are somewhat weak but it will keep you laughing. There are far too many funny scenes to mention so you decide for yourself once you've seen it.",1127347200,3,1274,4.467811158798283
808700,3,6304167725,"The title itself of the Wayans Brother's 1996 parody, Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, comically implies to several different films concerning African-American males coming of age in socially troubling environments.  Some of the titles that come to mind are Boyz n the Hood (1991), Juice (1992), and Menace II Society (1993) among many others.  Even though many of these films possess a high cinematic value, the Wayans recognize an excess of these types of films, as they provide a parody portrayal of the difficulties young African-American males face while growing up in rough neighborhoods throughout the United States.  Guiltlessly the Wayans approach this theme with ruthless abandon while applying their traditional spoofing spin on it, which unquestionably will cause both irritation and amusement.

The story follows a similar path of Boyz n the Hood from which the audience will recognize the name Tr&eacute;.  Here the name has mutated into Ashtray, and is performed by Shawn Wayans.  The film opens with a picturesque aerial shot of the neighborhood where a stop sign is one of the first things that attracts the audience's attention, which states, ""I wouldn't stop if I was you.""  It is a brief display of impending parody and the comic tone that will heavily play with stereotypes and prejudices, but it also hints of the merciless assault of satire that the Wayans will deliver in this film.

Ashtray's mother drops him off at his father's place while she states, ""You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies.""  Ashtray is supposed to learn how to become a man from his father.  Hilariously the audience will discover that Ashtray's father is younger than him, and this immature character could not possibly teach Ashtray any character qualities such as responsibility and loyalty.  Instead, the father informs him not to smoke or drink his stuff while also letting him spend bedtime with the women he brings home.  Despite the crazy humor, the Wayans produce serious undercurrents that deal with racial issues, stereotypes across ethnic groups, and gender issues.

The social importance of friendships is seen through Ashtray's cousin Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) whose identity is more or less ripped off from O-Dog in Menace II Society.  The parody does not take any hostages in this film, as it fools around with the idea of being in bad company.  Together Loc Dog and Ashtray continue to display the daily struggles of living in the `hood.  There are moments when the film presents high quality parody to scenes where the comedy sinks to the level of a third grader's poop humor.  Nevertheless, Don't Be a Menace touches a part of the American tapestry with brutal honesty, as this spoof could also serve as a social criticism.  The scene where they play Po'Nopoly, a Monopoly spoof, highlights some of the dismal situations where society limits the African-Americans.

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood might suggest to some that there have been too many films about struggling young African-American males.  Maybe the parody is on society, as several films have to be made, yet no significant changes have been made to help promote a better situation for African-Americans.  The Wayans recognize the problem and through this parody deliver a message that something has to be done so people do not need to say, ""Man, I need to get out of this place.""",1126396800,6,3465,4.980902777777778

808855,4,6304167725,"All you need to know is that if you never see another Wayans movie, you should see this one. It's ten times funnier than Keenan Ivory Wayans' other films that all turn ridiculous at some point. Of course Don't Be a Menace is stupid, idiotic and doesn't make much sense but that's the point!  It's a comedy. If you have one inch of humor in your soul you'll find at least two scenes in this movie that will have you chuckling or falling down laughing. But I must warn you. If you haven't seen Menace II Society, Boys in The Hood, Poetic Justice or Higher Learning you're going to be lost faster than the Blair Witch crew. Yep, in order to appreciate Don't Be A Menace you have to see the films that inspired it or you won't understand a thing. If you've seen these other films you'll understand where the film is coming from and why bringing comedy into such dangerous drama becomes a beautiful thing. At least for two hours. Besides any movie with Bernie Mac is hilarious even if he wasn't in it for more than three minutes. I would have given it five stars but some things in the movie were just too silly to be funny.

Shawn Wayans plays a black guy from the 'hood' that seems to go through plenty of struggles with fitting in and Marlyn plays a black guy who fits in perfectly.  This is basically a parody of Menace to Society.  If you haven't seen that movie it's also a must see.

I gave this movie four stars because it shows it's viewers numerous stereotypes that black people face in the world today.  I'm not going to give the story away, but in one scene, Marlyn and Shawn walk into a liqupr store and the bell that suppose to ring when someone enters says ""Nigas"".  Then as they walk throught the store this asian woman insists on following them around.  She doesn't folow the white guy around that's in the store.  She thinks that he won't steal anything.  The funny part about it is that he's the main one stealing everything.  At the end of the scene, the white man shows that he stole eveything and still gets away.  This was to show that every time a black person goes in a store, they are the first person that is though to be stealing.

Another instance is when Daishiki, Trey's ""girlfriend"" who is the entire future hood's mother, instructs her children to ask Trey what they always ask a nice young man when they first meet him, ""Are you my daddy?"" The members of Trey and LokeDogg's gang include Preach, a black rights activist, Crazy Legs, the former dancing champ of the hood who is now in a wheel chair and appears to be a toddler, and Old School a senior citizen who appears to be tough but still lives with his mother. Among the hijinx are LokeDogg's job application, he becomes a testdummy for a car dealership, and Malik, the first person in the hood to attend college, getting a little surprise moments into his college career.

We soon find out that Ashtray is actually a couple years older than his father - I'm still confused about that.
Overall the film spoofs just about every ""hood"" film of the 90s from Boys 'N the Hood to Poetic Justice. It does have its funny moments that will really have you laughing, but then there are times when it seems like the Wayans brothers are trying a little too hard to get laughs (e.g. the grandmother who swears, smokes weed, and gets in fights for the fun of it gets old after a while).

809014,5,6304167725,"Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood os one of the funniest as far as the Wayans spoof comedies go and I'll put it to the table that it's one of the best comedies I've ever seen. You can see that the Wayans really wanted to shed some light on the violent ""hood"" movies of the early to mid 90's and they did it very well.
Honestly, every hood movie was made fun of in this movie. Boyz in the Hood, Menace II Society, Juice, Friday, Poetic Justice, Higher Learning you name it, they made fun of it. And let's not leave out that they also made fun of how society depicts the inner city. But even so, it was still done in good taste and truly at no one's expense (so really, lighten up. It's just a movie).
Marlon Wayans really came into his own in this one. He really showed his true comedic and acting abilities in this and made sure that every moment in this movie had a laugh in every scene. This was the starting point and the staple of how bad they were going to make fun of other movies (IE Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2).
This is a must for people who love spoof comedy and comedy in general because no matter what, you will laugh through the entire movie. If you're looking for other spoof movies or anything of that nature, also check out CB-4 and the spoof of it FEAR OF A BLACK HAT. And of course, SCARY MOVIE and SCARY MOVIE 2. And if you still want more, how about FRIDAY and NEXT FRIDAY? I'm sure out of all of these suggestions, you'll be able to fund something that you like along with Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.",1037577600,6,1608,4.124203821656051
809117,5,6304167725,"`Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood' is an hilarious take on all the hood type movies and surprising it does come off really funny. Just as funny as `Friday' and such movies. Brothers, Marlon and Shawn Wayans, don't have any problem making fun of the typical ghetto life that a lot of Afro-Americans might have to experience. The thought of this might not be too appealing at first but give it a try and you should end up laughing without a doubt. Some viewers have said that you need to be a black person to find this movie funny, or you need to have lived in the hood, which, in my opinion, is not true, I'm white, I live in England and my face was so sore after laughing at this. The only thing that helps is if you've seen the movies that this is parodying, and then you should certainly have no problem finding this film hilarious. Just like I did.
To say, `Don't Be A Menace...' is a comedy classic is quiet the understatement. All the characters in this movie provide laugh after laugh. It's the practice run for Wayans movies to be made years later on. `Scary Movie 1 & 2' clearly have borrowed the mold from `Don't Be A Menace...' More films should be as funny as this one. Marlon's character `Loc Dog' certainly squares up to `Smokey' from the `Friday' anyday. Marlon's dialogue/appearance is cleverly written to poke fun at the stereotypical male you've seen in any John Singleton film. The cast is strong, good comedic performances come from the Wayans brothers (although, Marlon is the much better of the two), Suli McCullough, and Lahmard J. Tate, playing Ashtray's father, the second funniest character in this movie. The script is almost faultless in its field, and the jokes come quick and they don't let up until the end. This all helps to make this an addictive comedy classic. This truly is TOTALLY GHETTO FABULOUS!",1033603200,12,1873,4.560830860534125

A brother named Ashtray learns is learning how to live in the hood from homeboys, he meets a black beauty, Dashikee, I don't know how to spell that but close enough. He wants to move out of the ghetto with her and start a new life, a new child but alot of things get in his way, mostly Toothpicks gang. There are so many funny parts in this film, I'd say the funniest are when Toothpick was at the party and was talking about being in the shower with men, the MC Hammer dream, the convient store incident and in the movies begining when the two guys get shot. I demand that you watch this film, but as I said only if your into this type of thing. Great movie! If you've seen Baby Boy then you might see some similarities.",1025222400,4,972,4.0942408376963355
809120,5,6304167725,"I laughed, I cried, I was moved.  The characters in DBAM were profound and deep.  Ashtre, the young black man desperately trying to make his life better, and rise up from the harsh realities of the hood.  His youthful father doesn't help Tre, who is more immature than his son.  A good example of his immaturity is when Dad asks Tre to read him an adult bedtime story while he pleasures himself.  Cousin Loc Dogg, whose wild and law breaking ways are harmful to Tre, but is a loyal friend.  Preach, the confused black activist with an affinity towards white girls from the trailer park is part of Tre's mini ""posse"".  Crazy Legs, bound to a wheelchair, represents a person who is physically challenged, yet never gives up his dreams of becoming a dancer.  Quite inspirational.  Dashiki, the golddigging girlfriend of Tre, with her 10+ kids from different fathers, wants to move Tre out of the hood-a good thing, no doubt.....but at her own expense of having a man to depend on.  Is Tre ready for such responsibility?  The character ""Toothpick"" teaches children it is wrong to break the law, and Toothpick represents what you will become if you are a law breaker-a positive message, no doubt.
Despite the seriousness of my description, there are some humorous parts of the movie, a good amount poking parody-type fun at other ""hood"" flicks, i.e. Menace II Soceity (the cheeseburger carrying vagrant is hilarious).  How can I forget the cannibus smoking, church going Grandma, who adds some levity to this drama.  The Korean grocery store scene represents a real life struggle between the two races, but, taken with a grain of salt, one should find humor in the constant monitoring of Tre and Loc Dogg by the shopkeepers.
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in learning about black culture in America, as well as having a good laugh.  This movie balances well between the serious side of life in the ""hood"", as well as throwing in a few proverbial bones for laughter.

The direction is very basic and pedestrian. There is no real plot and the structure of the film is so badly put together that 88 minutes feels like 188. It's a bad problem that might cause you to just stop the movie halfway thru.

809213,5,6304167725,"First of all, Don't Be a Menace shouldn't really even be called a ""movie"". Instead its a series of adventures that make fun of hood movies from the 90s decade. Shawn and Marlon Wayans are a great comedy team and Marlon's voice in this movie sounds kind of cooky (like Larenz Tate in Menace II Society)
Truth be told: This is a hilarious movie. Between the Korean store shootings, Keenon Ivory Wayans as the mailman yelling ""MESSAGE!"" in more than one occasion, and Crazy Legs' dream of being a dancer, you'll laugh your butt off. This movie doesn't have a plot...which is better in some cases and not in others. The only thing you won't like about the movie is that it had a very low budget (it cost more to do the VHS box art), and that the movie is very dark and Loc Dog's voice..... at least that scared me.
Overall, Don't Be a Menace is a hilarious movie. Believe it or not, it's better than ""Scary Movie"". It sucks as an actual movie, but not as a fan just looking for a good laugh.",998092800,8,987,4.283422459893048

The movie was written by and stars Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans. The film is about a young man named Ashtray who is dropped off in the ghetto to live with his father and from there he gets into many crazy situations with his best friend Loc Dog. I'm tired of people who bash this movie, it's not a movie meant to be taken seriously, it's a movie that was made for pure entertainment.

Being a white boy, I don't think being white or black has anything to do with whether or not you will enjoy it. I think if you liked and appreciated the originals, you'll love this. Also see Friday and Another Friday, funny movies.",978566400,3,523,4.24
809283,5,6304167725,"Wow, this movie is still as funny as the first time I saw it. Shawn and Marlon Wayans soar in their first film together. They made a great team on their older brother Keenan's show ""In Living Color"" with brilliant humor that no one could match. Sahwn and Marlon make a great pack in this movie.
The film is about Shawn Wayans who up and till his 19th birthday, has lived with his mother. However, no that he is a man, he needs to be a man so his mother drops him of in the ""hood"" with his father how is younger. So, Tre ""Shawn"", goes around the neiborhood, meets up with my favorite character, played by Marlon, Loc-Dogg. Together along with the ""gang"" they drink a lotta 40's, smoke alotta ""herbel medicine"" and stop a villian who still thinks he is prison. Tre meets up with Tooth Pick's {villian} old girl, who is baby-prone,meaning 20 mins. after sleeping with Tre, she is pregant with his child.
This movie is a classic, with ""Scary Movie"" and the sequel coming out, I forsee the Wayans family name still being a house hold name for the years to come. If you need a laugh, I would highly suggest this film. Warning though, this is not for your Grandma, it is for their's, LoL.
So I am leaving you with this quote that I am sure you hae heard numerous times before, ""I got these cheese burgers!""

The plot, however, is excedingly  lacking, but plot isn't the point of these movies.  The lack of plot only  adds to the humor, because everything is so unexpected.  Some people may  find this movie offensive, but it's essentialy not poking fun of  ""ghetto"" African-Americans, it's poking fun at the common  steriotypes of ""ghetto"" African-Americans.

809399,4,6304167725,"There are a few conditions required for ""getting"" this movie.  You have to understand a few things before getting the jokes.  Probably the most important thing is that you've seen Boys 'N The Hood and/or Menace II  Society.  These two movies contain the majority of the spoofs seen in Don't  Be A Menace...  There are also references to Poetic Justice, Juice, and  Higher Learning.  Without having seen the first two, most people will  probably not get the jokes.  Secondly, if you're into the hip hop culture,  this movie will be a lot funnier.  There's a lot of play on words from the  rap lingo that you won't get if you haven't listened to it.
I really  enjoyed this movie.  It's a hilarious spoof of gangsta movies and gangsta  rap.  Keenan Ivory Wayans' cameos were hilarious.  Shawn and Marlon make a  great comedy team.  It's just too bad they don't get more exposure (they're  TV show on WB is hilarious, too).  It's all tongue in cheek fun pointed at  the harsher looks at inner city life that we get from movies and  music.
