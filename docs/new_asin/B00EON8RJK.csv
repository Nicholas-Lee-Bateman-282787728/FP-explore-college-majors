5931696,4,B00EON8RJK,"This is a good documentary - not as intense as Restrepo, but very well done none-the-less.  One of my closest friends and two acquaintances are in Shepherds; I have nothing but total respect for them, the other members of the documentary, the Oregon National Guard, and our military in general.  ""Thank You"" truly does not fully express my gratitude to our military, let alone those in Shepherds.",1432684800,2,396,4.895522388059701

8607566,4,B00EON8RJK,"I've purchased several docs and movies on the subject of the wars fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This is a decent one. They are generally similar, with snippets of real battle arenas and much conversation amongst the soldiers.
God bless those who have given of their time, physical and mental well-being, etc. for America and out of a sense of duty.
It's too bad that Democrats and those in their wake have squandered much of the gains. Tragic. They are very guilty but for some reason they are not held accountable! How a low-life like Hillary Clinton could even be considered as POTUS is insane.
God Bless America. People need to open their eyes and start thinking straight. The Democrat party is a true opiate for the masses.",1473206400,3,729,4.703125
8607567,5,B00EON8RJK,Very well done documentary.  I do not much like the cover photo used on the DVD case as it has nothing to do with the actual team potrayed or the era but my guess is few care about that.  :-),1468713600,,191,3.75
