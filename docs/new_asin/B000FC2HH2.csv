8325096,1,B000FC2HH2,"I bought the DVD, ""House of Shakira"", live at Firefest 2005, thinking of course, as anyone would think that it was a DVD of the one and only, SHAKIRA.  Amazon advertised it with all of the Shakira tapes and DVD's. I had bought two other DVD's and audio CD's and was really satisfied with them.  However, don't buy the House of Shakira because it has nothing to do with the real genuine Shakira.  All I received for the cheating price that Amazon charged was a bunch of speed freaks screaming their stupid music.  I really take the blame for this rip-off DVD. I and you should be aware of all the different ways that Amazon and Caiman.com cheats, probably thousands of customers.  Oh, Yes, Of course there's no way that you can contact Amazon or Caiman by phone and get a refund or exchange and of course, they'll never answer your e-mail.  Watch your back, because Amazon will stick a knife in it and take your money and won't give you what they represented.",1150502400,42,958,4.477011494252873
