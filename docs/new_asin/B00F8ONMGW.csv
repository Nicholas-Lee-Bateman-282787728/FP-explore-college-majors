5970672,2,B00F8ONMGW,It was not done right not enough camera coverage could have been better done with up to date equipment I thought it was juvenile,1391990400,4,128,4.375
5970673,5,B00F8ONMGW,"Chuck and the rest of the In the Dark Investigations crew utilize a variety of investigative equipment including the KII meter, various digital voice recorders, and the SB7 Spirit Box, among other devices, to investigate the Haunted Willow Creek Farm. Chuck, Larry, and Al present the viewer with a selection of EVP evidence, as well as evidence from other devices including the KII, to present a compelling case in the search for what happens when we die. Best of all, it was fun listening to these guys banter back and forth as it seems they definitely love what they do. I give the video a definitive 5 stars and look forward to whatever In the Dark Investigations brings to the field next.",1380240000,4,693,4.688524590163935
5970674,5,B00F8ONMGW,"What struck me me most about this documentary was it's honesty. By that I mean, Chuck made it a point to display what it means to be a paranormal investigator. No glitz,no fame seeking and solid evidence of life after death. Just a small group of guys doing what they do best, investigating a haunted location. I have been to Willow Creek Farm and it is an active location",1380153600,,372,4.405797101449275

8613167,1,B00F8ONMGW,"Don't waste your money.. Horribly done, horribly edited.. Easily faked..",1407369600,,72,6.3
8613168,5,B00F8ONMGW,"This is quite an emotionally disturbing documentary, but I thought it was well presented and interesting.  I think it's good that people learn about the horrific events that went on at this site so that they are better informed about how to protect themselves.  As regards the whole ghost thing, I think it was presented intelligently and without any alteration.  A very good documentary.  Not comfortable to watch, by any means, but gripping and important.",1404604800,,457,5.053333333333334

8613170,1,B00F8ONMGW,this is the slowest ghost hunting video ever! not worth the few bucks I paid for it! I was bored threw the whole thing,1397433600,3,118,3.9583333333333335
8613171,1,B00F8ONMGW,"Bad camera angles, cheap production value, no real facts to keep the story alive, no real entertainment or even educational value, very slow story line, alot of meaningless shots and scenes, why do i need to watch the crew set up in slow motion?...is this entertaining or interesting? I didn't think so",1394755200,5,302,4.826923076923077
8613172,1,B00F8ONMGW,I guess anyone with a loose sense of interpretation and some GHOST equipment can make a ghost hunting doc. waste of time,1394582400,3,120,4.5
8613173,1,B00F8ONMGW,"bunch of old guys treating what they think are ghost like little kids or pets. no hardcore evidence,they talk all the way through the investigation.it sucked don't waste your money",1393200000,7,180,5.033333333333333
8613174,1,B00F8ONMGW,"...by the ghost of my wasted money.  Happily, like the 'documentary' itself, it wasn't much.
Seriously lame.  It was less than an hour of confusing, badly recorded and illiterately subtitled nonsense.  At one point, before the Investigators left the farm, everyone is clustered in the kitchen around some sort of meter - like a stud finder that construction workers use, only I guess for ghosts - and the group is asking really stupid, patronizing questions of a spirit named 'Mike'...the gadget lights up periodically and the room goe crazy like seals for fish.
""Mike - should I tell the UNDERWEAR story, Mike? Should I? Wasn't that funny?""
No response.
""Mike - should I tell them about the UNDERWEAR? The story of the UNDERWEAR? Should I tell them, Mike?""
Lights on the meter.
""OH, MIKE! YOU ARE SO FUNNY AND HERE RIGHT NOW!""
I may be paraphrasing because i don't give enough of a mortal s*** to rewatch this horrid documentary just to be accurate. Accuracy clearly means nothing here.
Suffice it to say this is REALLY NOT WORTH ANYONE'S TIME.  Not even Mikes. Not even the underwears.",1392422400,8,1087,4.7967914438502675
