Best part was, I was saved the trouble of converting the VHS to a DVD as the seller had included one at no extra charge and without my asking! Nice touch. It's amazing how 35 years later, a scary tale isn't so scary any more.",1474761600,,312,4.216666666666667

In Scary Tales, the Captain takes us to many fascinating locations where the most bizarre things happen.  We go to Transylvania where Dracula tries to disguise himself in a suite of armor.  We'll see the goofy quackertrician cure Binky the Clown and journey to the kingdom of Glitzberg where the queen and her subjects are all mechanical dolls.  But best of all, we'll witness the adventures of Famous Army, the world's most courageous girl, who braves the dangers of an underground train to retieve a valuable photograph.  Silly Stories and Scary Tales features the best of the Captain.  His tales of mischief and mayhem will titllate kids everywhere, while driving home a message or two about goodness, a main staple of the Captain Kangaroo Video Showcase.""",1122768000,5,921,4.903225806451613
