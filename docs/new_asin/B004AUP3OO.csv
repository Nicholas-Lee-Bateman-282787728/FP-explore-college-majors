4311306,5,B004AUP3OO,"Jean Reno kills it in this movie, which might be his best work in years. This is a pretty critically acclaimed movie, and it does not disappoint. It is extremely fast paced and brutal. You will not be bored. This DVD in particular is a great way to see the film. Excellent picture quality and audio. The subtitles make complete sense. And it plays just fine in any standard USA DVD player, as that's all I've got. Enjoy!",1288569600,13,420,4.397435897435898

8420914,3,B004AUP3OO,"`The Professional returns!' screams the UK DVD sleeve for 22 Bullets aka L'Immortel in an attempt to pass this Luc Besson-produced Jean Reno-starring revenge thriller off as a sequel to his 1994 hit (and with a kidnapping subplot you can bet they'll try passing it off as another Taken Stateside), but it's more of a traditional gangster revenge thriller with a very different main character. Charley Mattei isn't a childlike hitman but a smart Marseille crime lord whose retirement is crudely shattered by an attempted hit that leaves him with 22 bullets in his body and a desire to return them with interest to his would-be assassins. After going to great pains to establish a multitude of suspects implying a whodunit element, it doesn't take him long to discover which of his childhood friends and cohorts is behind it so we can get down to the business of killing them off one by one inbetween the odd car chase, shootout and torture, all of which is handled with slick efficiency by veteran actor and sometime writer-director Richard Berry. It may be very loosely inspired by real gangster Jackey Le Mat and his 70s gang war but it's neither biopic nor a realistic depiction of the Marseille underworld and there's nothing new on offer, but as an undemanding star vehicle it works well and benefits from more than decent supporting turns from Kad Merad, Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Marina Fois.

Unfortunately both Anchor Bay's UK DVD and disappointing Blu-ray disappoint by cropping the image from its original 2.35:1 to 1.85:1 (and it's not a case of `unpicking' the masking to reveal more image on the top and bottom of the frame: from the widescreen extracts on the making of featurette included in the surprisingly decent extras package they've cropped off a lot of information from the left and right of frame).

8420915,4,B004AUP3OO,"Hardcore brutality with no apologies or regards toward finesse or refinement.

A rocky and confusing film that improves the longer the story plays out. I equate it to strolling into a hockey game where everyone on the ice is wearing the exact same uniform. The puck is flying and there's a ton of action, but it's a struggle to figure out the teams.

I had to re-screen the opening sequence three times before I was able to scope out who was who and what their relationships were to one another. No joke, inside of the first fifteen minutes of film (and over the course of nearly half a dozen overused flashbacks) we're introduced to more than a dozen characters - many of whom look remarkably like one another; dressed the same, having similar scrubby facial features and speaking in a similar growling fashion. And few have scenes longer beyond a minute or two.

So this movie takes an effort to get into. However, once you have the players straight, it quickly becomes a pulsating action-filled bloodbath with an assortment of brutal paybacks as one man's revenge unfolds and his enemies retaliate.

The story: Jean Reno is Charly Mattei, one of three childhood buddies and the best of friends, who learn early on that the way to their dreams is by way of blood. Sealing their bond over the corpse of a revered mob boss, the trio rise to the top if the Marseilles crime scene. But after so many years at the top, he decided to retire, selling his interests to his two blood partners and walking away from anything business related. Satisfied that he's completely divested from his past, he chooses to live quietly with his wife and two children, far away from the life he once knew.

Or so he thought.

A hit team is sent. And 22 bullets later, Charly is dubiously honored with a new title - Mattei The Immortal. Not something he wanted.

Permanently crippled in his right hand and his family in jeopardy - he wants two things.

One: Who?
Two: Why?

The rest he'll answer with pain and suffering.

And wooboy, there's a lot of that. The sheer amount of bullets, blades and blood is difficult to categorize since it's pretty much a non-stop festival of the same.

I would be remiss not to say that this could've gone either way for me. The extreme difficulty in the beginning of the film is hard to dismiss. But the remainder delivered what it promised.

Out of respect for one of my favorite actors, Jean Reno, this rates a four for me.

Movie Warning:

- If you love your four-legged kids, this may not be the movie for you. If it's any consolation, Reno's character Charly is a pet lover too.",1347062400,,2597,4.545064377682404

8420917,3,B004AUP3OO,"Interesting Jean Reno action film, but you probably would not watch it if it had an unknown actor in the lead.  There is a big error at the end of the film, which I won't give away. It is a DVD best rented first, because I doubt you will watch it more than once.",1326067200,,262,3.8518518518518516

8420919,3,B004AUP3OO,"""L'immortel"" (aka. ""22 Bullets""), produced by Luc Besson's company Europa Corp, stars Jean Reno as Charly Matte, a retired Marseille mobster brutally gunned down by eight masked assassins. With 22 bullets in his body Charly survives miraculously, but refuses to tell anything about the incident when a local police detective Marie Goldman (Marina Fos) visits him in hospital for investigation.

Usually in this kind of thriller, the wounded hero embarks on a revenge mission trying to find who is responsible for the attack. In ""22 Bullets"" things are a bit different as the identity of the culprit is not a big secret to us (and Charly). Besides, what Jean Reno's hero, now preferring a peaceful life with his family, does not desperately want the deaths of those who shot him ... at least for now. After all Charly, whose criminal career goes back to his young days (told in flashback), wanted only a quiet life. In short, he wants to change.

But, of course, we know he can't and when something happens, Charly is forced to take a gun and fight back. Don't expect big action set-pieces, car chases or explosions, though. While the film does not avoid graphic violence (like ""The Godfather"" trilogy), it is more about guilt and redemption, and the man who is consumed by his own past.

""22 Bullets"" directed by Richard Berry is loosely based on a real-life attempted murder on Jacques Imbert in 1977, whose right arm remained paralyzed as Jean Reno's protagonist. Except that part, ""22 Bullets"" is a standard French thriller with some clichd narrative elements of gangster films. Though Jean Reno hasn't lost his charisma, acting here is not his best and some part of the story (especially the motive for Charly's murder) is not just convincing.

Overall ""22 Bullets"" is an acceptable gangster thriller with nice performances from the supports including Kad Merad and Jean-Pierre Darroussin. It tries to be something more than an average vendetta movie, and almost succeeds.",1298937600,2,1976,4.9787878787878785
8420920,5,B004AUP3OO,"Jean Reno delivers in this movie. I can't remember the last movie of his I really really liked since THE PROFESSIONAL. I won't give anything away. You just need to see this movie. This DVD was great. Fantastic, clear picture on my 65 inch LCD DVD. Perfect subtitles. I hope they never dub this movie. It will ruin the nuances of the dialog.",1289952000,7,340,4.412698412698413
