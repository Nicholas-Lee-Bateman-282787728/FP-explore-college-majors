8586018,5,B00CT4YQ3W,"I watched La Montana and realized that Russell Stendal must be one of Christianity's
best kept secrets. I had read his book ""Rescue the Captor's"" about growing up as a missionary's son and then being kidnapped by guerrillas. So I knew this movie was going to be an exciting reenactment of his day to day adventures.  I wasn't disappointed.
I treasure my copy of the DVD and am looking forward to hearing more about the miraculous changes that are taking place
In Colombia as a result of this one brave man's efforts.",1466467200,,516,4.608695652173913

8586020,5,B00CT4YQ3W,"When I read Russel Stendall's (Martin) story, I always feel that it needed to be made into a movie and what a delight to find out that it was.
Even though the movie could not give the full picture/story and impact of his ministry over this war-ridden country, this film, based on the true story without any exaggeration,  indeed inspires and encourages the faith, hope and love.  Another plus is you can see the beautiful scenery and real life of Colombia.
Recently (today is 3/18/15), Stendall is imprisoned again for the work of God. Please remember his chain and pray that God's will not be hindered at all.  More people will come to the Lord because the testimony of this bear brother in Christ.  And he will be released at His time.",1426636800,,737,4.5606060606060606

8586023,5,B00CT4YQ3W,"I have personally had the privilege to spend part of a day with Russell, to hear him speak three times now, to meet his son Russell Jr, and to read the story of how God has been using this ordinary man and his family to reach people for Him from the time he was a little boy through reading his books Rescue the Captors, Rescue the Captors II, and more recently The Hidden Agenda.
I finally was able to sit down this evening and watch La Montana. I highly recommend it.  God is doing so many wonderful things in the world.  All we usually hear about is the shockingly sad news.  If we keep our eyes only on what we see around us in our own little environment, we may be blessed to see some amazing things, but, if that is the only place we keep our eyes on, we miss out on so, so, so much of what God is doing world wide.  In areas where on the surface there seems to be the least amount of hope, God is doing mighty miracles!
I not only recommend this movie, but, to get a fuller understanding of our amazing God's wondrous works, I highly recommend not only getting this movie, but the above mentioned books as well.",1419552000,,1118,4.138248847926267
