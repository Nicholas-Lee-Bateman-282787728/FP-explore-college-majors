5104687,4,B007Q0JJD6,"It's great to see these again,especially being re-mastered from the 35mm negatives with great picture and sound quality. The Ghost Story's are complete,uncut,with next week previews intact,which is a nice bonus. The only drawback are the Circle of Fear episodes which have a cut abbreviated main title which is missing the announcer and preview clips from that episode. Not sure why these were cut??otherwise they are perfect quality. But I cannot complain too much since they did put them out.",1336089600,7,494,5.1875
5104688,5,B007Q0JJD6,Eventually the dvd companys are realizing people want to see even one season shows and some that didn't even last a season. Ghost Story and Circle of Fear are among those with a huge cult following. Finally you can throw away your bootleg copies. These cleverly written horror stories stick in your mind since you first saw them when you were a kid. And they hold up to their eerie creepiness. They should be great copies cause they kind tested the audience interest in the William Castle Set that came out with two bonus episodes. They were both brilliant transfers which proves they took care of their original stock. Plus such neat stars of yesteryear surprise you with each episode. I am so glad I didn't waste my money ordering a bootleg set. Can't wait.,1335744000,8,759,4.62962962962963
5104689,5,B007Q0JJD6,"The transfers of these 23 episodes are pristine, and more complete than any version I've seen in syndication. Of the 14 Ghost Story episodes, these have not only the previews that ran before the credits, but also a Sebastian Cabot epilogue with scenes from next week, something that was always cut in syndication - not even the bootlegs have ever had these! Also, syndicated episodes suffered numerous tiny cuts over the decades, in order to meet the demands for more commercial time. I was pleasantly startled to see newly restored footage in the episodes I was most familiar with, 'The Dead We Leave Behind' and 'Earth, Air, Fire and Water.' The closing Screen Gems logos are intact. A couple of complaints: There are no extras, no subtitles, and no closed-captioning, and each episode is un-chaptered, consisting of a single file; one cannot skip ahead within the episode. But I can live with these.

Here's hoping for comparable quality releases of similar series, like The Sixth Sense, Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected, Journey to the Unknown, and Darkroom!",1334880000,7,1068,5.0
5104690,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I bought this as a pirate version but the quality was very poor and you miss so much with poor quality like in the concert captain I can't even see the ghost and some commercials are partly there.  I'm so happy to finally see the quality that it should have.  I also bought the William Castle collection just to see the two episodes from ghost story and circle of fear.  I loved this show when I was a little boy and it scared the hell out of me. I think the show came on every weekend. I remember my father and sister and I waiting for this show to come on.  We would eat pistachios and watch it.  Some of the shows I thought were very scary back then like Dark Vengeance, Death's Head, and Creature of the Canyon.  The music in it is very scary and I think the same composer for this music also composed the music for Night Gallery which I am also finally getting the 3rd season now.",1334188800,8,885,4.116279069767442
5104691,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I am so excited that this is finally coming to DVD!I remember watching the show when it originally aired back in the early 70s!
I never thought it would be released and now my dream is becoming reality. Thank you Sony!!",1334188800,11,219,4.365853658536586
5104692,5,B007Q0JJD6,"UPDATE: Now that I've received the dvds it's time for an update.  The picture quality is superb and everyone should be happy. The only let down is the cheap menus that were created for the episodes.  All you get is a listing of episodes with images of various Sony tvs in the background.  Apparently, where the menus are concerned, creativity is not required when making these on demand dvd sets even though the price is higher than a standard set.
Overall this set is still well worth the price for the rarity and cult status that this tv series holds.

This is fantastic!  The classic anothology series from the early 70s is finally seeing a dvd release!
This series was made when tv productions were still original, creative, and not cheap to make reality shows.
Even though the price is slightly high and the set is dvd-r it is still worth it and a small price to pay for being able to own this classic series!!",1334188800,32,915,4.4879518072289155

5104704,5,B007Q0JJD6,"This sci-fi/thriller/supernatural anthology has fascinating stories (several adapted from Richard Matheson), a great cast from the early 1970s (e. g., Stuart Whitman, Jason Robards, Barbara Parkins, Geraldine Page, and many others), and excellent picture quality.  The acting and music effects are quite good.  Suspense is built through an unveiling of clues and uncanny situations, rather than relying on overdone digital special effects of today's films.  It is also serves a ""period"" film from the early 1970s, the last age of simplicity and leisure before the computer age.

5104715,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I discovered this set when I was obsessed by the memory of one of these episodes (At The Cradle Foot) I remembered viewing as a tween.  I couldn't remember the name of the series, though pretty sure it was a TV episode and not a full-length movie I was remembering.  I was determined to find out what the heck I was remembering.  Long story short I searched and searched on line and finally found the Youtube recording of the episode in question, watched it and realized THAT was what I was remembering.  I decided to purchase the entire series  once finding out it was available through Amazon.  I haven't finished the entire set, yet, but it's looking more and more familiar (and pretty creepy).  I must say that the picture quality is superb.  I've purchased recent series sets that aren't this clear and crisp.  I'm not even sure why the above episode was the one to stand out in my mind, but if it hadn't, I wouldn't have searched and found this set.",1451865600,2,955,4.473988439306359
5104716,5,B007Q0JJD6,"This is one of those TV programs I could barely recall for years. I recalled the episode with Helen Hayes and the boy terrorized by his doppleganger, and I recalled the Jodie Foster episode with the girl controlling her home using voodoo and a dollhouse. A few years of research, and I was pointed to this series from the dustbins of my memory. ""Ghost Story"" was a much more paranormal version of ""The Twilight Zone."" Stories involve ghosts, werewolves, haunted houses, witches and other entities. Some of the episodes stand out better than others, but its appeal may be in recognizing the old 70s actors and sets, (like the ""Bewitched"" house in the aforementioned Jodie Foster episode). This DVD is a prize; a nice reminder of a series with a very small cult following that night otherwise have been totally forgotten.",1449792000,,819,4.815602836879433

5104719,2,B007Q0JJD6,"After reading all the great reviews, I'd gotten my hopes up that perhaps this show, though episodic in nature and shorter in length, would at least retain the spirit of the wonderfully scary/eerie ABC TV movies of the 70s, but unfortunately not.  I really do wish these were better than they are, but they all seem to have the exact same plot conceit- someone is haunted by/possessed by a long dead, wronged spirit and/or is seeing things that no one else does and no one believes him/her.  The first three episodes were virtually interchangeable and the rest had minor variations.

I will say that the transfer looks wonderful.  These episodes barely look their age and are bright, sharp and in excellent quality. And it's a lot of fun to see some really good actors somewhat slumming it in a horror episodic anthology.  But not really worth the price to purchase something you'll likely only watch once.  I'm going to try and finish the remaining episodes simply because I paid the money.",1420675200,3,990,4.760233918128655

Love, love, love it.  It was like peering back into my childhood.  Thanks.",1413504000,,250,4.020408163265306
5104725,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I had forgotten all about this series until the set was released and then flashes of it came back. Melvyn Douglas as a grandfather on a dark mission, Rip Torn & Geraldine Page as a spooky Southern couple living in a decaying mansion, Patricia Neal as a guest who has lost her husband while staying in an unusual hotel. As someone who has been reading horror stories for over 50 years and who possesses a number of horror anthology books, I used to be quite attracted to horror anthologies on TV until I gave up TV watching (outside of movies and certain sporting events) in the mid 1970s. I grew up with shows like TWILIGHT ZONE, THRILLER, THE OUTER LIMITS, and NIGHT GALLERY.

What all these shows had in common in addition to having a supernatural theme,  was that they were hosted (or a voiceover in the case of OUTER LIMITS) by someone who introduced the stories and then summed them up in the end. GHOST STORY featured Sebastian Cabot fresh from (and glad to be rid of) FAMILY AFFAIR. He was an ideal host and gave the program an old fashioned storytelling aura. Imagine my surprise when halfway through the season Sebastian was dropped and Mansfield House was replaced by a groovy looking psychedelic intro ballyhooing CIRCLE OF FEAR. At first I thought it was a new show until I saw William Castle's name in the credits. I was so incensed that I stopped watching then and there and put the show out of mind until this set appeared.

Watching it again after 40 years gave me a new and now nostalgic appreciation for the program. The list of guest stars was truly astonishing from seasoned pros like Helen Hayes, Jason Robards and Melvyn Douglas to up and comers Mike Farrell, Hal Linden, and a 9 year old Jodie Foster. The script supervisor was Jimmy Sangster who had written so many classic scripts for Hammer Films in the 1960s and the concept/development was by the great Richard Matheson. William Castle was the producer and no matter what you think of his gimmicky horror films, they were always well made. This production savvy also extended to GHOST STORY which, for a 1970s TV series, looked really good with better than average camera movement and some decent lighting (though not as creative as NIGHT GALLERY). It also featured some top flight Brit Horror directors such as John Moxey (HORROR HOTEL) and Robert Day (SHE).

Of the 14 original GHOST STORY episodes, the pilot episode (about a bewitched statue), the ones I mentioned at the top of the review, and one about the ghost of a dead twin stand out. I had not seen any of the CIRCLE OF FEAR episodes until now. These stories have a darker edge to them and offer few explanations. I particularly liked DARK VENGEANCE with Martin Sheen, LEGION OF DEMONS with Shirley Knight, and SPARE PARTS with Susan Oliver. It was great getting reacquainted with younger versions of top 1980s stars or older versions of classic Hollywood performers like Helen Hayes and Patricia Neal. GHOST STORY / CIRCLE OF FEAR was the last gasp for the classic horror anthology show. Times and tastes were changing and it succumbed to poor ratings. Kudos to Sony for reissuing it on DVD-R. I know that younger people won't care but I, for one, am glad to have this series back.",1413072000,6,3221,4.635726795096322
5104726,5,B007Q0JJD6,"Only had time to watch 1episode thus far but was excellent reproduction quality.

The episodes have serious plots that don't look childish or make you laugh instead of being scared. I do enjoy series like ""Tales from the Crypt"", but they don't give me that nice spine-tingling feeling that a horror-movie fan looks for and can't easily get.

All of the 23 episodes have you in supense, in that eerie atmosphere that only the 70's movies could create. Furthermore, there are neither absurd visual effects nor ridicule plots in the stories, that seem completely reasonable and possible to happen to anyone.

5104736,5,B007Q0JJD6,"Obviously I am not the only child with fragmented memories of this show!

I was 5-6 years old when it originally aired, and little snippets resided in my memory into adulthood.  The toy horse that grew and moved by itself.  The woman who turned into a moth.  The guy with a hatchet in the snow.  The voodoo dolls made from cookies and toothpicks.  THE JARS that sucked people inside of them.  Of all of them, I remember the jar episode most vividly.  My dad was a huge fan of Creature Features about that same time, and oh the movies we got to watch!  Not to mention the nightmares.  I had no idea if these little bits I was remembering was from a Creature Feature movie or a T.V. show...and my parents don't remember.  I tried explaining what little I remembered from the jar episode and they looked at me like I was bonkers.  They didn't remember either.  Thank goodness for the internet!  I discovered this series, and immediately bought it.  The quality is great, and watching these old shows, while they are not as frightening as I remembered as a kid, they fill in all the blanks for me, and I am thoroughly enjoying them.  What a wonderful program!

Disc one would not play on any DVD/Blu-ray player that I own (four), so I had to send back the DVD collection for a replacement; when the replacement DVD-Rs arrived, all would play on my Blu-ray player but once again one would not play on my other DVD players and no, the DVD players are not old or the el-cheapo units. So disc one could only be viewed in my living room. Very disappointed in the poor ""blank discs"" that Amazon chose to use. Lastly, the show, once I got to view it was just not what I thought it would be; it was not bad but just not what I thought I watched 40 yrs ago as a child.",1391990400,4,685,4.044117647058823

5104739,4,B007Q0JJD6,"I remember watching this in its original run. At the time I thought this and Kolchak the Night Stalker were great. Being able to watch this series again brought back some memories. This time around though it wasn't quite as scary as I remember it. Still very watchable and was nice to see Mr. French narrating the first of the series' episodes. The up side is that some of the episodes really hold up. The one with Jason Robards, in particular, still keeps its suspense. Some are pretty silly though. In retrospect I can see why it was cancelled. Almost all of the major actors/actresses are either very familiar and/or of high quality but quite a few of the story lines are pretty weak. Another case of my youngster memories becoming a bit jaded this time around. Still recommended to those in the same boat as myself or to those who want to see how a suspense/horror anthology outside of Twilight Zone etal. was presented in the early 70's. Great sentimental value.",1390608000,5,967,4.627906976744186

5104741,5,B007Q0JJD6,"This is a great trip down memory lane and I wish I could chat with all of the reviewers in person as I seem to be the only person in my age group over here who remembers (and loves) this series!
Funny, I don't recall it ever being called Circle of Fear or remembering that introduction. I only remember Sebastian Cabot and that eerie opening sequence with the ghostly blue opening credits and spooky music. Sure, it lacks the punch of modern horror movies and series, but the imagination behind it is vastly superior and it's still a bit creepy.
Amazed by the picture quality, but the lack of an episode guide insert is just miserly considering the cost of the set.
Still, I'm currently loving this trip back to my childhood.",1386374400,5,725,4.5

5104756,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I was in my teen years and in high school when this television program came out. The show aired on Friday night and I watched some programs. I would watch with other family members. I did not see all the episodes and I was happy to see this series out on DVD

Sometime back I did buy what I believe were bootleg DVDs of this program. I say this because the picture quality on these DVDs was poor. They were probably recored off the TV. One sees portions of TV commercials and TV station credits would pop up while the program was being played. When I saw this item listed I got curious. I did read some of the reviews and saw none unfavorable. With that I ordered the product, watched the DVDs and was very pleased. The picture quality was fantastic, The colors fantastic, and the sound quality fantastic. However the epiosode titles are not printed on the individual DVDs. I did not see this as a problem.

Now all 23 episodes are good-really good. They all have twists and turns that surprise and enhance the story of the individual episode. I can't describe them all but I will briefly describe some that do stand out. Hopefully this will get the reader excited and interested enough to want to go out and buy this product

* Ghost Story/The New House: Pilot episode. A young couple moves into a new house-their dream house. The woman is pregnant and the due date is near. Their new house is haunted by a woman who was unjustly hanged back in the late 18th century and she was hanged at the site of the house. Her body was buried at the site of the house. The woman does give birth to a baby girl. In time that woman would have a face to face encounter with the other woman's ghost and she demands the baby. The episode ends with the baby possesed by the dead woman's spirt.

* At The Cradle Foot: A man (played by James Franciscus) is having strange dreams. He dreams of a young woman being murdered by a young man. After more dreams and other events he determines the woman in his dreams is his future adult daughter and she will be murdered in the future. So he sets out to a town he would see in his dreams to try and prevent that from happening. While there he learns the name of his daughters future killer who hasn't been born yet. He meets the man who will father that person and he is engaged to be married. The first man tries to stop the marriage. He will succeed in stopping the marriage by accidently killing the other man. He thinks his daughters future killer won't be born. There is a twist: The second mans fiancee is pregnant with his child.

* House of Evil: An elderly man in enroute to vist his son-in-law. It's not a friendly visit. He blames his son-in-law for the death of his only daughter who died giving birth. He plans revenge and he plans to use his granddaughter (played by a very young Jodie Foster) to get that revenge. He does this with a doll house that's modeled after the house the family lives in and dolls that represent each family member. Yes he uses voodoo. He almost succeeds but the granddaughter with help from an unlikely source will save the day and the tables do get turned on the grandfather.

* Alter Ego: A young boy has an injury that keeps him out of school and confined to his room, He's bored and he loves chess. So he creates a double of himself out of his mind so as to have a chess companion. But things go horribly wrong. The double start living the life of the other boy and it's intentions are evil. The double goes to the boys school and goes to work to bring down the boys teacher (who taught the boy how to play chess). In time the double will cause the teacher to die. In the end the double challenges the boy to a game of chess and the winner is the one who lives on. The boy is saved by the spirit of his teacher-the one the double killed.

* Spare Parts: A doctor is murdered by his wife and his spirit is out for revenge. The spirit will get his revenge through three patients who received organs from the doctor. One patient received his eyes, another his hands, and the third his vocal cords. The wife is tricked into coming to the hospital by the patient who received the vocal cords. In time the doctor confronts his wife through these three patients and she confesses to murdering her husband. The episode ends with a mention of the woman going to trial in two weeks. It should be mentioned how the doctor was murdered. She would trap him in the garage with his car running. A weight is placed on the accelerator. This is early 1970's. Automobiles did not have pollution control devices. Also back then gas had lead. The doctor is overcome and dies from carbon monoxide poisoning.

* Legion of Demons: Beth,a shy woman from a small town is talked into coming to a big city by her best friend Janet who is also from the same small town. Janet tries to get Beth to attend functions with her and the other office workers, but Beth refuses. But strange erie things start to happen. First Janet vanishes and the other office workers take a special interest to Beth. The other office workers are Satan worshippers and they have special plans for Beth. Also things happen to Beth that frightens her. In time Janet reemerges and directs Beth to a vacant office. It is here where the other office workers dresses in Satanic robes grabs Beth and places her on an alter. Then Janet approaches the alter in Satanic dress that depicts her as the key Satanist for the group. Janet's plan all along was to sacrifice Beth to Satan as a special offering. Janet is about to put the knife to Beth but in the nick of time the office executive who is not among that group and had earlier befriended Beth will rescue her
and will turn the tables on the Satan worshippers.

5104761,5,B007Q0JJD6,"As a huge fan of anthologies such as TZ, Night Gallery, Outer Limits, and Boris Karloff's THRILLER, I was thrilled to see this released to disc.

Program Content: This is a William Castle production - and that usually carries the connotation of theatrical gimmickry. But far from a gimmicky spookfest like House on Haunted Hill or 13 Ghosts (don't get me wrong, I love those films for what they are), this TV production came along in the ""modern"" television age. This was 1972-1973, several years past the William Castle produced, Rosemary's Baby, and contemporary to the final season of Night Gallery - a new era, to be sure. Furthermore, this series had the guiding hand of Richard Matheson (I am Legend, Legend of Hell House, Twilight Zone, Duel, etc.) The result? A paranormal series with an edge. The overall tone is, I dare say, a tad edgier than Night Gallery. And, yet, the series is a product of its time. What I term ""edgy"" must be viewed in the context of its time, and viewer expectations must be adjusted accordingly. This was not a period of flashy editing and jump scares, but, rather, a time when Story mattered. Thankfully, Story drives this anthology and Richard Matheson is the captain. And the cast is stellar, too. The names read like a Who's Who of the best working actors of the time.

Picture Quality: The prints used in the mastering of these DVDs are superb. Color and clarity are pristine, and there is NO discernible damage or excessive grain. The image quality adds an extra dimension to the enjoyment of these shows. They are better than what we've seen released in the Night Gallery issues, which date themselves to the same period. It can't be underestimated how much the visual quality adds to the experience, and here we've got a shining example of what is possible with standard definition. In a word, these shows are beautiful, the combined result of the original cinematography and the modern mastering.

Packaging: I was a tad concerned about the Made-On-Demand packaging quality I awaited my order. When it came, I was delighted with the sturdy Amaray case and artwork. The discs come in a thick plastic case with flip sleeves to house each individual DVD securely - kudos to SONY for paying attention to such details.

I bought mine for significantly less than the list price at Amazon. But even at List, these are a superb value, considering what we get: 24 episodes of a high-quality gem from yesteryear. By the way, the total minutes are over 1100 minutes, not the ""701"" that Amazon incorrectly lists.

Purchase without hesitation!",1347840000,24,2574,4.801354401805869
5104762,5,B007Q0JJD6,"Ghost Story/Circle of Fear is the best horror show that has EVER been on T.V.

5104763,4,B007Q0JJD6,"I just got the DVD release of ""Ghost Story/Circle of Fear."" I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised.
I had boot-leg copies from a late night showing back in the '80's and I knew there had to be cut scenes. I had to go immediately to ""Alter Ego"" with Helen Hayes. First of all, I loved her in ""Airport"" and this was 2 years after that. There were scenes restored that I had never seen on the boot-legs: dead flys on the floor, more dialogue about her 'lost' golden pencil and closeups of the dead cat, hamster and even Helen Hayes' (Miss Gillden's) bloody hand.
The epilogue was great with Sebastion Cabot and I had forgotten about this. Once I saw it, it reminded me of watching this back in the '70's where they would show scenes from next week. This really is a time capsule!  Sort of reminds me of the ABC Movie of the Week.  There's a lot of the same actors and actresses.
Who doesn't love seeing Stella Stevens, Patty Duke, Elizabeth Ashley, Susan Dey etc.!!!
BTW: for some of you die-hard fans: ""Alter-Ego"" uses the same ""Bewitched"" house which had just been cancelled the season before. You can tell that they re-modeled the set and changed a few things. Even Robert's bedroom was the same one used for Samantha and Darrin albeit a few minor changes.",1344470400,14,1265,4.448275862068965
5104764,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I found this listing by accident looking up Night Gallery. I read the reviews and pondered on getting this series. It being on six DVD-Rs really turned me off. If I knew it came from Sony, I would have ordered this sooner! They put out some good DVD-Rs(they did a fantastic job with an oldie called Ladies in Retirement with Ida Lupino). And I am glad I ordered this series! This is killer stuff and very addictive TV viewing. I am only up to disc four but I love it. The only let down is that some of these episodes could have been hacked down a bit. Some just go on and on...
All I know these episodes look fantastic for 1972-73. It is hard to believe these are not pressed because Sony did one great job on restoring and cleaning these episodes up. The sound is nice and solid. And thank you Sony for presenting these in their tv aspect ratios. I have heard several tv series are being processed to fill a 16:9 screen (1.78). That should be a no-no!! What are studios thinking!?
All in all, Ghost Story/Circle of Fear is the greatest (even over my favorite Thriller) horror series from the past. Just glad to have discovered this series! Now I can't wait until daylight so I can watch some more (sorry a little too scary for night viewing).
By the way, if anyone is freaking out about the price, you must realize these DVD-Rs are for a special market and they make only so many. So get it while you can. You won't be sorry.",1342828800,13,1426,4.285185185185185
5104765,5,B007Q0JJD6,"I consider Ghost Story (Circle of Fear) to be one of the best horror anthology series ever made and I am a fan of others such as Thriller and Night Gallery.  This DVD package delivers the goods, the shows look as though they were filmed yesterday.  They have top notch authors and big name actors performing in them.  It is a shame that the series was cancelled after only one season.  When comparing this series to it's contemporary, The Night Gallery I rate it as far superior.  The special effects are top notch and not cheesy, there are no ""humorous"" sketches, just riveting and suspenceful programs.  Sebastian Cabot does a great job as the shows host, although the Mansfield House itself is very cheerful and serene when contrasted with the stories presented.  Cabot was jetisoned as the host a little more than half way through the series when it was switched over to Circle of Fear due to poor ratings. His departure and the new format was not enough to save the show from cancellation.  I have very mixed emotions about this, in those days a show often failed, not because of poor content, but because of time slot placement--whatever it's competition was, it was sufficeint to doom the show.  I wish they had retained Cabot and perhaps tried some better marketing techniques, although the Circle of Fear format did produce some very creepy offerings.

Unfortunately the only place this set falls short is that there are no special features, or even a list of the episodes on the DVD packaging.  That should not deter you from purchaing this top notch collection though, because there was nothing else like it produced prior to it or since.  These shows shine in that they were able to create scares without resorting to shocking or grizzly footage.  I remember watching it as a child with my mother and being frightened silly by it; although I can't say that everything I fondly remember from childhood has held up that well over time, this series will produce chills and thrills and perhaps make you want to leave a light on when you go to bed.

Although there is a disclaimer saying the disks will probably only work with standard DVD players, I am able to enjoy these programs both on my TV and my computer.  It is worth every penny and I'd waited many years for these to become available.",1340841600,44,2302,4.649382716049383
5104766,3,B007Q0JJD6,"As a fan of 70's television, I am overjoyed that these often talked about but seldom seen series are finally seeing the light of day through the miracle of DVD. When Rod Serling's Night Gallery's all three seasons were finally released I was overjoyed since I always appreciated Serling's work all the way back to his early days with ""Patterns"" and ""The Arena"" from Playhouse 90 and Studio One.  Night Gallery was an uneven series at best, partly because Serling had relinquished control of the show to Jack Laird, the series producer. Nonetheless, the show did manage to delight and scare small children like myself who begged their parents to stay up just a little bit later to delight in Serling's foray into the macabre.

Ghost Story, while entertaining, with Sebastian Cabot as your portly and sophisticated host, Wilfred Essex, offers some unusual tales covering a gamut of stories like ""Bad Connection"" starring Karen Black, where a widow on the verge of remarrying, appears to be receiving ""prank"" phone calls from her deceased husband.  A nice idea, but wasn't this idea exercised before with Serling's Twilight Zone episode, ""Long Distance Call"" starring Gladys Cooper? To it's credit the show does utilize some interesting locales like the Hotel Coronado in San Diego and a number of A list televison stars that reads like a who's who's of prime time 70's TV: Gena Rowlands, David Birney, Jason Robards, Stuart Whitman, Walter Burke, Karen Black (who can forget her in ""Trilogy Of Terror?"") A far more interesting episode is ""House of Evil"" starring Melvyn Douglas and Richard Mulligan, about a deceptive kindly grandfather (Douglas) who practices voodoo and communicates telepathically with his deaf-mute granddaughter in a plot to avenge the death of his daughter during childbirth.

The DVD quality is superbly remastered, but from a dramatic angle the episodes seem to drag and are notoriously padded with irrelevant scenes and dialogue that do little to move the plot forward. Twilight Zone and Night Gallery managed to do this in 30 to 40 minutes, and develop a significant build-up of suspense leading to a satisfying climax. Ghost Story, while stimulating to a degree and moderately entertaining, won't be an out and out nailbiter frightfest, but for the casual viewer, should provide a few satisfying shivers.",1340236800,14,2329,5.10498687664042
5104767,5,B007Q0JJD6,"Tonight I watched ""DARK VENGEANCE"" for the second time in 40 years, and it was just as good as the first time! (Note: I'd managed to catch both ""HOUSE OF EVIL"" and ""ALTER EGO""---both of which I saw first-run in 1973 as an eleven-year-old---on Youtube, and believe me, there is a reason why many movie critics describe the early 1970's as the truly golden age of movies and television)

Watching horror stories for tv requires a suspension of disbelief, but contrary to what you may read in the other reviews, the acting and directing (pacing)of these stories is very well done.",1339977600,6,577,4.712871287128713

It was a bit confusing when they changed the title an we never saw Winston Essex anymore, but we took to Circle of Fear just the same. The title sequence to Circle of Fear is so 1970's, its great! I am pleased with the quality of the discs. The menu is disappointing. Extras would have been nice. But just being able to watch the episodes again and remembering how all us friends were back then is great. A few of the episodes are kinda cheesey. Technology in film has skyrocketed since this show has aired. Some of the ""special effects"" are laughable, but it was the 70's! Most of the stories are well-written. Some of the acting is terrible.

The one about the hospital patients who get the spare parts scared the hell out of me (Meg Foster's eyes still haunt me). In the mid-80's some of them were re-run in syndication and i taped them but the quality has eroded.
The new set has arrived and I'm overjoyed with the pristine quality. I can't recommend this enough. We'll never see this type of show again. Great stars, great scripts (by 'pre-television' generation writers).

I would have given this 5 stars (the show is well worth it) but I held one back because I felt that the releasing company could have at least included an episode list on the physical DVD & minor liner notes. Instead, one has to put the DVD in order to see which episodes it contains.

My first experience with GHOST STORY was when I was about 10 yrs old & the pilot ""The New House"" debuted on television. Now, I was a die hard ""Monster Kid"" who practically LIVED for monster/horror films & shows. I had been from my very earliest memories, with the very first movie I ever remember watching being a showing of Bava's BLACK SUNDAY on the late show when I was 5. So, by the time GHOST STORY premiered I was pretty jaded for a kid. Not much could really scare me.
So, when I sat down to watch the pilot that night with my older sister, I certainly didn't expect to be thoroughly terrified by the end. Yep, to me, William Castle's chiller was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. And when I was sent to bed after the show, I just laid there in the dark with my eyes wide open like saucers recalling all the terror I'd seen on the screen.
Needless to say, I didn't sleep much that night.
Not that the experience lessened my excitement when I learned a while later that GHOST STORY was going to become a regular weekly show on Friday nights. To which I tuned into religiously during it's run. Loving each & every episode. Even after it dropped it's host Sabastian Cabot & changed it's title to CIRCLE OF FEAR for no apparent reason.
I suppose it goes without saying that I was beyond disappointed when the show failed to return for a second season. And, unfortunately that was the last I saw of the program for decades. That is until I purchased a bootleg DVD-R of the pilot online in 2003. I wasn't even aware that THE CBS LATE MOVIE used to show the occasional episode back in the '80s. One such telecast being the source from which said bootleg of ""The New House"" came from. A bootleg that was SO damned muddy that it was just about unwatchable. But watch it I did & despite the less than mediocre picture & the hissing, crackling sound, I adored it & STILL found it to be a creepy, spooky ride.
And it left me wanting more. But, after having shelled out $15 on the pilot, I just couldn't justify spending some $300 more to get the rest of the episodes. So, I decided to wait & see if GS/CoF would ever see an official release. I thought it was a remote possibility, but after a few years with nary a mention of the show's very existence, I thought it was a lost cause.
That is until last week when I happened across the news that this box set had finally been produced. And it made my day. Hell, maybe my year!",1337126400,5,2581,4.2439024390243905

Anyways, I can say that while the DVDs are barebones, the transfer is crisp and great and well done. The clearest versions of the show to date. Heck I can say even better than watching them on TV back in the day. Very highly recomended for fans.

Now if they can release the following in that DVD on demand schtick:

The Evil Touch
Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected
The Darkroom
Night Visions
Great Ghost Tales
Way Out

8520947,5,B007Q0JJD6,"This was an interesting series.  I used to watch it as part of some late night syndicated programming.  I was happy to find this on dvd.  When I had watched the syndicated runs of the show each show ran separately.

If you enjoy nice scripted paranormal story lines and classic tv, you will most likely want to pick up a copy of this oldie but goodie.",1519084800,,351,4.2727272727272725
8520948,3,B007Q0JJD6,"Not as scary as I remembered it, but some episodes like the one with the toy horse had enough creep factor to keep me watching.",1514160000,,127,4.12

8520950,4,B007Q0JJD6,"For decades this was impossible to see, and unfairly sorted with the inferior The Sixth Sense (series).  GS/CoF is closer to Rod Serling's Night Gallery: uneven but distinctive, with some excellent episodes, vaguely European.  It's from the era of atmospheric, psychological slow-burners like Burnt Offerings, The Beguiled, and Let's Scare Jessica to Death; also comparable to the later, British series Hammer House of Horror.  This was the heyday of the horror TV-movie, and a few GS/CoF episodes played in 90-minute slot.

Admittedly, the series has less shock value than most of the above.  The stories tend to be simple, and more languidly eerie than frightening.  The budget restricted night scenes, not always well apportioned (e.g. the lamely comic ""Elegy for a Vampire"").  There are numerous ghosts and a few monsters, but the consistent theme is existential anxiety and guilt.

The most acclaimed episodes are the notorious (but now, half-camp) ""Legion of Demons,"" and Harlan Ellison's ""Earth Air Fire and Water"" (IIRC, he wasn't entirely displeased).  I would add the unnerving ""At the Cradle Foot,"" the horrific ""House of Evil"" (Jodie Foster, Melvyn Douglas), and the cinematic ""Creatures of the Canyon"" (Angie Dickinson, Arthur Kennedy).  Roughly half the segments have a female character investigating a haunted site, notably ""The New House"" (the pilot, by Richard Matheson), ""The Concrete Captain"" (Gena Rowlands), ""The Summer House,"" ""Half a Death"" (Pamela Franklin), and ""A Touch of Madness.""  Some episodes have (only) camp/nostalgia value, such as ""Graveyard Shift"" (with John Astin and Patty Duke, and series producer William Castle in an autobiographical role), and ""Bad Connection"" with Karen Black.

Halfway through the series changed title (and lost host Cabot), but I see little difference in the two incarnations.  These discs are an excellent presentation, but bare-bones, without even chapter stops.",1506470400,,1926,5.488135593220339
8520951,2,B007Q0JJD6,I cannot believe some reviewers compared this awful show to the Twilight Zone.  Nearly all the episodes were poorly written.  The acting was pretty awful too. The show is neither scary nor cryptic.  In fact it is pretty dumb. The only reason to buy this is for the collection of stars and to see the huge 1970s cars.  Don't pay more that $18 for it.,1506038400,,349,4.323076923076923

8520953,5,B007Q0JJD6,"l like the program very much. it remi ds me of some of my happy teen years. you won't find this kind of grand entertainment in ghost stories anymore....but you will find todays trash and junk for this new generation. back in the 1970s when Ghost Stories came on tv, it was scary and great suspence. you will curl up with your most warm comfortable pajamas and well bathed.... popcorn on a cool winter night and this series ..a glass of wine or a coke and your good to go on an mild adventure of scary. Host Sabashian Cabet takes you there... he was a wonderful host...Cabet SHOULD have been included in the neew line up for Circle of fear... never the less this is a TV Treasure!!!!",1498435200,3,682,4.3359375
