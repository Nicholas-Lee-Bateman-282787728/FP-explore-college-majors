6351479,5,B00JAFDFBM,"I found the Mother Goose Club about a year ago when trolling YouTube for videos of ""The Wheels on the Bus"".  Once I introduced this group to my 2 year old, he was hooked.  I am SOOOOO thrilled that this DVD exists and we are all loving it.  Nothing beats being able to pop this in the DVD player and hearing the catchy tunes one after another rather than search for each individual video on YouTube.  I highly recommend to anyone who has small kids and are weary of putting them in front of the TV with any old video or movie. The Mother Goose Club gets my son singing and dancing every time.",1399939200,3,592,4.166666666666667

Of course, we may still need to buy another of their DVD's for Day-O & Old McDonald, but are pleased they have this collection of songs available.",1399852800,,429,4.821917808219178

Gives mama basically a 45 min break, which is occasionally badly needed lol. The singing and dancing is just perfect for his age and he even tries to imitate the dancing and hand motions performed for each song. I don't know why he loves this so much but the silly costumes and overly excited and happy characters are his absolute favorite!

Not all humans are costumed, some young adults and teens (from a music academy?) sing and present hand songs.  Over all very well planned.  Absolutely excellent!!",1479168000,,448,5.420289855072464
