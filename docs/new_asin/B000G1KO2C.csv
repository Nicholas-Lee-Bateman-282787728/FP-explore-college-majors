This is a rare find to me being that it is such a short opera, it appears that it is rarely available independently. The production is just OK but the music is simply beautiful.",1357430400,2,256,4.354166666666667
8213220,5,B000G1KO2C,"The cast here is very similar to the Karajan's recording dated three years earlier: Karajan (conductor), Cossotto (Santuzza), Guelfi (Alfio) and Martino (Lola).

Cecchele replaced Bergonzi as Turridu and Di Stasio replaced Allegri as Lucia.

The singers here appear to be more dramatically involved than in the previous recording:

Cossotto, who has been previously held-back a bit by Karajan, is now unleashed.

Di Stasio, perhaps not as beautifully, sounds older than Allegri in the disc, which I find appropriate.

On the whole, the first recording can be regarded as the more musical (and in that area unsurpassable) while in this recording Karajan fits himself to the movie necessities, hence pays more attention to the drama.

What I liked about this movie especially is the camera-work:

The focus seems to be always the best it can be to reach the maximum effect, plus there are a lot of panoramic picture from the shores of Sicily which add something exotic.

I must add that the singers are giving not only a very good musical performance but also putting on a very credible acting!",1149897600,11,1092,4.994475138121547
