8637186,4,B00HXH5XDM,"This entry is a continuation of Monogram Pictures ""B"" grade cowboy adventures.  The three heroes in this volume (seven) give an excellent cross section of their stable of western heroes.  As in the previous six volumes the production values were excellent.  I would recommend this for your collection.  I hope Warner Bros continue to produce these DVD movies.",1394755200,9,359,5.137931034482759
