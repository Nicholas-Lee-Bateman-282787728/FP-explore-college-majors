8175772,3,B000NA1W54,"During a 20 year class reunion, 4 friends and their spouses/girlfriend get together for a few days and reminiscence about old times and talk about what they are doing today. Much of the film is four guys talking on the golf course with formula slapstick comedy. The girls all get together and are envious of the 22 year old wife.

The film was rather trite. The ending brings things together in an attempt to make it into a feel good romance, but lands short of the cup.
