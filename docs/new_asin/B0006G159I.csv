8378057,4,B0006G159I,Loved this movie!  Bruce Greenwood and Emma Samms were great together.  I could have done without the Simone/Brent shower scene but other than that it was a perfect rainy day romantic movie.,1244764800,,190,4.90625
8378058,5,B0006G159I,I am so glad this movie is finally out on DVD.  I saw it when it first aired on CBS.  I have been waiting a long time for it to come out.  I loved Bruce Greenwood and Emma Sams in this movie.  It was pretty close to the book too.,1101945600,11,229,3.52
