7031868,3,B00UAJ6X6G,"A small boat full of exiled Vikings get marooned on Scotland, which doesn't want them either. Asbjorn (Tom Hopper) leads the group who happen to defeat a troop of soldiers and capture the princess (Charlie Murphy) the film's sole eye candy. They plan to ransom her off to her father for enough money to buy their way into a Viking settlement in the south. The plans go bad when they find out the rescue army wants to kill the princess, which they claim are the orders of the King. The Vikings are aided by a fighting monk (Ryan Kwanten) with a staff. Oh yes the princess can read the ground too. Ed Skrein leads the Scots who appear to be one chromosome away from Orcs.

The film consists of Vikings running away from Scots, getting caught by Scots, fighting Scots and running away from Scots. The love story doesn't develop. The fight scenes weren't bad, but not memorable. Acting isn't bad for people who grunt.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Charlie Murphy cleavage. Tom Hopper beefcake. 2 1/2 stars",1431388800,73,1008,4.594444444444444

Even though it is set in Scotland no filming took place there.  No mind, though.  The area shown looked quite a bit more the northern areas of Scotland.  Having lived there for five years I feel I am somewhat qualified to say so.

7031887,3,B00UAJ6X6G,"Spoiler alert!

This probably had potential on the drawing board but it seems like halfway through the writers just got bored or the write was a comedic genius. The actors do the best they can with the script they've been given but there are giant holes and the ending leaves alot to be desired. My husband and I just kind of looked at each other and said wtf did I just watch. Vikings crash in Scotland, find a highborn lady. Run from Scotish mercenaries, fight, run, meet Jason Stackhouse, fight, run, etc. And there's this floundering love arc that never gets resolved. EVER!

I think the high points for us were yelling 'hey Jason Stackhouse!' and alternately screaming 'It's Francis! We found Francis! He's hiding in Scotland!'  Oh and being right that the old Viking was basically never going to die. He'll be outside the gates of Valhalla screaming  'I've got my axe! let me in!'",1484438400,,886,4.660256410256411

7031933,4,B00UAJ6X6G,"The film was well done.  It excelled in creating the timeline and the customs of the day while making it possible for a contemporary audience to understand the dialogue as it did not use the languages of the time.  Instead it used modern English with a dialogue structure that resembled more the time and their beliefs.  The use of the landscape was very believable and make the storyline more credible.  The actors and actress were well chosen.  The combat scenes where very well done as well as the stunts.  Only exception is the warrior priest that seems to have knowledge of Asian martial arts and some, not too many, combat postures that we have now come to see in every film, especially in the Marvel productions--though this is not one of them.  The most significant exception for me not to allocate a five star rating comes by way of how the storyline was executed.  The film seems to start in the middle of the story and end a bit vaguely.  However, as a viewer, it keeps one in your toes and it is difficult to anticipate what will happen next, which is a very good thing considering how predictable films have become.  Caution is there are some strong violent scenes with an extra shot of gruesome--not recommended for kids under 25 or delicate sensibilities-I could have done without the gruesomeness myself.",1464048000,,1320,4.675324675324675
7031934,5,B00UAJ6X6G,"A great story with great actors, well-written, beautifully filmed, and directed with a precise but delicate balance.  I kept peering over my shoulder for the Berserkers' to appear, at which point the entire film would implode, but that never happened.  The excellent director, whose name I was not sure of, please excuse me for this, knew just how much restraint to apply and exactly when to apply it.  We, i.e. my husband and I, were kept entertained and on the edge of our seats for the duration.  We both loved this film and found it well worth watching.  Sometime soon, I at least, plan to do so again. It is a great relief to find a good action movie that DOES NOT drip with profanity, graphic sex scenes, and graphic beheadings or other bloody and violent means of dispatch.  We were even spared the de riguger, plunging necklines for the which showed lots and lots of cleavage and goosebumps, while the guys were bundled up in as many furs as they could manage..

Yes, the classic tropes are there, not only for action adventure fight scenes but also for expected settings (cliff climbing, rope bridge crossing, etc), but you will pleasantly pleased by a coherent story line well enacted, more than decent battle scenes with bro in arms moments, and an internal logic to everyone's behavior, from Vikings to mercenaries and all caught between. And for once the Christians aren't trashed because that's ""the easiest story telling thing to do"".

The Vikings, their hostage, and the crazy monk are extremely likable. The mercenaries are extremely hateable. No fancy-smancy hoodoo with the supernatural either. The ring of fire is possible. The ground-touch sense makes ""sense"".

And you might pick up a few history lessons to investigate.

The fighting is melodramatic, probably because of a lack of special effects.  SPOILER:  Right, the knight goes against the king's order on a rescue mission to save the king's daughter, and a knight convinces his more reasonable brother to tell the men they are on a mission to murder the king's daughter.  END SPOILER:  The ending was really a doozy, but fitting because the whole movie was so silly.  With an army lining the top of a hill, and a coastal cliffs at their back, the few vikings left end up jumping off the cliff.  The first one jumps and then they give a shot of the water, massive waves crashing into the side of the cliff.  There's no way anyone could survive the waters.  Suddenly the viking is in a large boat, oaring his way out of the waves.  The others jump and a shot from above shows them falling into quiet waters.  Ridiculous!",1455753600,,1018,4.374331550802139

7031985,2,B00UAJ6X6G,"If you are seeking a shallow, fantasy-viking romp through the woods, that seems to use every Hollywood viking cliche, this is your film.  If you want a movie about vikings or the North Sea region in the dark ages, look elsewhere.

The trailer for Northmen: A Viking Saga does a good job of laying out the plot.  A bunch of Scandinavian boys get ship-wrecked off the coast of Scotland, wash ashore, randomly capture a princess and then find themselves pursued by a bunch of sadistic mercenaries who dress like Warhammer Chaos Warriors (complete with skullz on the back of their helmets?!!).

The movie is made up of a series of set piece fight scenes, hung together with some random attempts at character development, most of which go nowhere.  There seems to be one of every type of cliched medieval battle scene (Siege, woods chase, rickety bridge, Ewok style forest traps, etc.)  At least the fight choreography gets a B+, and the actors do there best with the mediocre script they have been given.

Some of the locations are beautifully rugged, but they are often no shot to best effect.  Costuming is 100% fantasy, complete with metal-washer ring mail and quick-rivet leather plate and scale.  There is also heavy use of clone-costumed extras.

Ultimately, the numerous cliches, lack of depth, and simplistic plot make Northmen a bland movie.",1451779200,,1346,4.889867841409692

The plot is very well put together, the acting is spot-on, and the action sequences are downright masterful. As with nearly all films, there are flaws, such as historically inaccurate weapons and dialogue, but taken as a work of fantastical fiction, but it's a really fun ride.

My only real reason for giving this film fewer than 5 stars is that my favorite character only lasted a few scenes.

If you're thinking about watching this because you have a true interest in Nordic culture and heritage: don't. This is just another bunch of your basic, stereotypical fantasy ""vikings"" - and not even done well for that. I expected at least some decent fights or effects, but got neither.

If you're coming for Johan Hegg: don't. You've probably seen all his part already, and it will just kill your perception of him if you think he actually cares for his ancestors to ever be portrayed at all accurately in popular media.

There is no real plot, characters are shallow and seem just thrown together into groups that don't even belong together. The scenery is distracting because it's painfully obvious it is not where they supposedly are by a longshot.

I'm pretty surprised they didn't put the ""Northmen"" in horned helmets and that there wasn't any random excuse for nudity... because that's the road the movie was hoeing. Most other cheesy things you know are coming before they happen, however.

7032041,3,B00UAJ6X6G,"Northmen: A Viking Saga is a 2014 historical action film by Swiss director Claudio Fh whose resume includes Hollow Man 2 and Sniper: Reloaded.  The film follows a group of Viking warriors who have been exiled from their homeland and end up on the shores of Scotland when their ship capsizes.  The group of a dozen or so is led by Asbjorn (Hopper) the son of their former ruler.  He is played by Tom Hopper who has starred in such BBC TV series as Doctor Who and Merlin.northmen

The Vikings manage to fend off an attack by Scottish soldiers and capture Inghean (Murphy), the daughter of King Dunchaid.  Asbjorn intends to hold her for ransom in order to guarantee his mens safe passage off enemy lands.  The King sets a group of Carpathian mercenaries on their trail led by the blood-thirsty brothers Hjorr (Skrein) and Bovarr.  The brothers see the princess as a possible hindrance to their continued employment and have no intention of returning her alive.

The motley band of Northmen finds themselves on the run from the mercenaries and their only ally is an unnamed warrior monk (Ryan Kwanten of True Blood).  The Vikings begin a desperate trek across the fortified Scottish landscape, hoping to reach a boat that they can use to make their escape.

First and foremost the central flaw in the film finds the savage Viking warriors doing more running than fighting.  One can guess that the thin budget prevented any sort of grand scale battles so we get a thinly-plotted story of this small band in constant retreat, fighting only when cornered, and then we are talking very small scale fights with a handful of combatants on each side.

We learn nothing of Kwantens warrior monk character at all.  Why he decides to help them is never fully explained but he does have a very cool tower with a cool fire trap that they use to keep the mercenaries at bay so they can make one of their many retreats.  Hes also a highly skilled fighter with his quarter staff.

When the Vikings finally do stop the engage in combat the fight scenes are exciting, bloody and fairly well choreographed.  Theres a bit too much use of slow-motion but at least no one breaks out their Kung-Fu as is often the case in lower budgeted historical action films.  The make-up and costumes look outstanding if not entirely historically accurate.  This can be excused somewhat as the Vikings have to make do with what weapons they can scavenge after losing most of theirs when their ship capsized.

The performances are passable but ultimately forgettable.  Tom Hopper is fine in the lead role although most of the others are stock characters.  They are also hampered by stilted dialog and forced dissention within their ranks.

The entire focus of the film is off target.  The film sort of reminded me of the cult gang film The Warriors from the 1970s with a group lost outside of their territory and on the run, trying to make it home.  Of course, this film is nowhere near as good as The Warriors but its worth a short diversion.

Within 5 minutes I knew I had made a mistake renting it.  The story line is predictable and boring. The costumes are completely fantasy based, and don't resemble anything even near to the time period potrayed. Everyone involved in this film needs to reevaluate what their goals are in the entertainment business and start over!",1440979200,3,462,4.634146341463414

7032063,4,B00UAJ6X6G,"Do not watch this as a serious Viking lore movie.  Watch it as a Vikings/Conan film.  So much of Middle Earth and the old Conan style fantasy is present and glorious.  Plus one of the towers in the movie looks like a tower in skyrim.  This is DnD, with a perfect party. Monk/Cleric, Magic User or Druid, a few fighters a barbarian, thief and ranger.  Watch it with the right mindset and this thing is Gold.",1440892800,35,406,4.2894736842105265

7032077,1,B00UAJ6X6G,"Cheesey. Unrealistic. Not very epic at all unless ""obviously tried too hard"" counts. Disappointing to say the least. I'm hoping that someday they'll make a real viking movie and get it right... Even a pre viking era movie about the Visigoths or other such Germanic tribes would be awesome... If they got it right. I don't think budget is as much of a problem as managing their expenses. In this movie there are certain splurges where in other aspects of the film there are cut corners. There is no plot. There are almost no character plots. The violence is stupid. I'm disappointed.",1440028800,,582,4.715686274509804
