6086669,5,B00GMM19J6,"I'm rating this a 5 just because for the fact that it's produced by PBS, which presents some of the best documentaries around.  I've always had a fascination with Butch Cassidy.  My Great Great Grandfather was friends with him and often provided him with a place to stay in Blackfoot, ID while on the run.  My Great Grandfather always told of the story where at one point he wanted to ride with Butch.  My Great Great Grandmother (a very strong woman) put her foot down and told her husband that if he did that he could never return.  Needless to say he chose to listen to her wisdom and stayed.  However, he always considered Butch a friend.  Now granted, Butch was an outlaw, but he made a lot of friends during his exploits and always was good to the people he knew.  The ""Old West"" was littered with outlaws, and from the stories I've heard throughout the years  from my relatives that Butch, while a criminal, was also a gentleman.  I look forward to watching this documentary.  I'm also proud that Robert Redford chose Utah as a place to live and payed tribute to these ""outlaws"" by creating the Sundance Film Festival.  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid will live in infamy and a part of the history of the Great United States of America.  Regardless of how you may feel about the outlaws of the time, these two gentleman have nothing on the atrocities of, not only other outlaws, but crimes against humanity from our government during this time in history.",1396742400,3,1465,4.5458015267175576

6086675,5,B00GMM19J6,"I am a history nut, and I especially like when it's told the way it actually happened even when it goes against the grain of popular belief. In this case, the subjects portrayed actually were pretty close to the way Hollywood made them out to be, but it filled in a lot details about them and told the whole story. I was disappointed with how they really dies, but I can certainly see why Hollywood changed it.",1419724800,,410,4.337662337662338

""In the early morning hours of June 2, 1899, two men crept along a desolate stretch of train track outside Wilcox, Wyoming.  Unable to force their way in [the door of a train car], the bandits packed the door with explosives instead.  In an instant, the holdup crew had made off with fifty-thousand dollars in cash, banknotes, and gold [today, worth over a million dollars] in the most spectacular robbery the West had ever seen.

In an era that saw cold-blooded killers like Jesse James and the Young Brothers terrorize the West, this job had all the markings of a different kind of gang: a notorious group of men known as the Wild Bunch.  Their leader, Butch Cassidy, was a charismatic thief who had elevated bank and train robbery into an art form.

But the freewheeling world of Butch Cassidy and his sidekick, a moody Easterner with a fast gun, known as the Sundance Kid, was based on a frontier order that was rapidly fading into myth.""

The above is what is said by the narrator at the beginning of this absorbing and informative documentary.  This is an episode of the series entitled ""American Experience.""

What this documentary does is give background information on:

(1) Butch Cassidy (real name: Robert Leroy Parker)
(2) The Sundance Kid (real name: Harry Longabaugh)
(3) The Pinkerton National Detective Agency (founded in 1850)

Then it proceeds to tell us how these three eventually intersect.

Finally, I was REALLY impressed by this documentary (released in 2014).  It has:

(1) Excellent re-enactments
(2) Excellent research and photography (in the form of newspaper articles, portraits, etc.)
(3) Brief, informative comments by historians, journalists, etc.

In conclusion, in my opinion, this is THE documentary to see if you want to know the REAL story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid!!

(2014;  50 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  5 chapters)

8624627,4,B00GMM19J6,This episode does a good job of demystifing these outlaw's tale without dissolving the romance they embody.,1515456000,,107,5.352941176470588

8624630,2,B00GMM19J6,"Certainly more educational than Newman and Redford, but hardly accurate.  Within the first 10 minutes I can count at least a dozen common inaccuracies/exaggerations used to, of course, make the story seem far more dramatic than it was.

This movie is like...  Like getting a bunch of eight year old boys to read some Wikipedia pages and listen to some old cowboy fables, then eat a bunch of pixie sticks, and ramble off a bunch of half-truths and unverified accounts and maybe-it-could've-happeneds and so, so, so, so overused sound bites - and jump around and hyperbolize and use drastic rhetoric to make it as interesting as humanly possible - at the detriment of even a semblance of historical integrity.

Though I suppose that's pretty commonplace for modern historical documentaries.

Bottom line...  If you have ever read any legitimate Wild Bunch literature, and are looking for a companion piece, this is NOT a good choice.  It will...  Scrape at the contours of your brain with it's blatant but popular inaccuracies,and give you no faith in the future of old west outlaw historical work - because once it makes it's way into a documentary or a book, it will be repeated and built upon until it becomes fact.  As is the common theme in all avenues of the human historical record.

God, I hate it.  This is just...  Too much of a broad stroke piece.

8624636,3,B00GMM19J6,If you want to hear the which parts the movie got right and which parts were fictionalized or conjecture then this is a great documentary. If you want to maintain the fantasy version you downloaded into your memory from the Paul Newman/Robert Redford version then maybe take a pass. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it with my son. It's fun to draw comparisons to the Hollywood version which relatively speaking was pretty accurate.,1454976000,,429,4.972222222222222
