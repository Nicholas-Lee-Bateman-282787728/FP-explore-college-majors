8056903,5,B000931Z70,"It is rather astonishing that the movies, ""Cruising Bar: [1]"" (Alliance/VideoFilms 104900 being the DVD edition viewed) and its sequel, ""Cruising Bar: [2]"" (Alliance VideoFilms 107406 being the DVD edition watched), seem, judging from so few reviews of them, to have generated, thus far (as of Sept. 2014), so little interest on Amazon's WWW sites. This is true even for Amazon-Canada, the national WWW site for the Dominion of Canada, where one would expect that films so phenomenally successful in Qu&eacute;bec (by Qu&eacute;bec's appropriate measure) would have garnered by now numerous reviews, ""pro and con"".

The two films are out-and-out farces, of course, which perhaps has meant that many who have viewed them, while enjoying the two movies, have not taken their worth seriously enough. Well, yes, they are farcical, but in the cleverest way possible! They are destined to be comedy classics in the way that the great Marx Brothers films, those of Mel Brooks, or, to single out an individual motion picture, as ""Hellzazpoppin'"" (1941) all have become.

Michel Ct&eacute; is a comedian of stature whose films, nearly all of them, have attained that kind of status in Qu&eacute;bec. In the case of these two films mocking the cruising patterns of date-scavenging (or, to be blunt, trawling for a ""one-night-stand"" hook-up), the humour is of the sort that easily should embrace the same kind of response from English-speaking audiences as from Qu&eacute;bec viewers. The culture of dating, with all of its decadence and inherent comic potential, from the 1970s onwards (with parallels in the past of dance hall and ""bar-hopping"" behaviour), which the two films portray, is internationally entrenched, for better or for worse, in most of the Western World. That phenomenon is something ripe for humour!

As for the geographical setting (Montr&eacute;al) that both works share, the two ""Cruising Bar"" motion pictures lack the grubby look of most U.S. and British cities since they, for their own part, have endured the ravages of commercial, economic, and industrial decline, which ""Free Trade"" and outsourcing of industry and technology have wrought, all besetting them since the baneful times of Grinnin' Clinton, Bush-whacker Jr., Obawumpa (in the U. S. of A.), and Thrasher, Blyar, and the new Cameroon Goon (in Britain). Montr&eacute;al, for its part (here in Qu&eacute;bec), still is a clean and attractive large city. However, ""Cruising Bar: [1]"", from 1989, and ""Cruising Bar: [2], of 2008, are set in earlier times (the second just barely) when some U.S. and British cities still had looked like something besides recycled Calcutta. So, ""nos ami(e)s Anglos"", let your imaginations wander and in your imagination apply the action that takes place in Montr&eacute;al to what had gone on in your own nearest-by pre-2008 metropolis. It helps that one can view the ""Cruising Bar: [1]"" with the dialogue set to hear it in English and that both pictures, on the other hand, are viewable in French with English subtitles. The antics in the two films, anyhow, are so physical in nature (with, of course, many visual gags), as farce naturally tends to be, that they would reveal what goes on even with the sound turned off!

Michel Ct&eacute; is such a master of comedy and disguise that his assumption of the roles of four different ""dudes on the make"", young (30s or so) in the 1989 film who have become middle-aged (50s or thereabouts) in the 2008 film, are totally convincing. When I first saw ""Cruising Bar: [1]"" back in 1989, I did not realise (as many other cinema-goers also did not) that Ct&eacute; was playing all four of the horny philanders! They are, by their nicknames, to take each in a different order herewith:

-- Le Taureau (The Bull, a genial, multi-orgasmic bourgeois businessman in a constant state of rut, who unrelentingly cheats on his wife, at work and at the local kitsch dating-pits in the suburbs);

-- Le Taon (The Peacock, a prissy ""clothes-horse"", fashion-obsessed and vacuously empty-headed ""metrosexual"", for whom no woman is quite perfect enough to justify his amourous attentions but who seeks sex, ineffectually, anyhow);

-- Le Lion (The Lion, the frenetically energetic and dim-witted ""perpetual adolescent"" who never takes responsibility for his gaffs and who brags and behaves delusionally, thus never learns how to become a responsible adult who can offer a woman the stable love that she needs);

and

-- Le Ver de terre (the Worm, an insecure, cowardly, and insecure, cowardly, and ugly nerd, who cringes at any challenge and is fearful to face life's challenges).

Ct&eacute; transforms himself in look and demeanor so successfully that he has no need of heavy disguise, apart from some help to pad out his trim body out for the chubby and dumpy-looking Bull, with that character's sagging paunch and chin(s) and fat cheeks. He seems (although I am not sure of this) to be using some costume teeth to give the Lion his toothy grin, but aside from these, he plays his various parts mostly through the sheer transforming art of great comic acting. The result, at any rate, is utter hilarity.

""Cruising Bar: [1]"" is even more fun to watch than its sequel, but both films are wonderfully comic. There is an aspect of ""Cruising Bar: 2"" that is very pleasing: it gives resolution and closure to the problems that most of the goofy dudes whom Michel Ct&eacute; plays face. In the second film,

-- The Bull's marriage is saved and he learns to be content (well, more so) with his own wife than to be cavorting with the other suburban housewives.

-- The Worm finds his true soul mate; he hooks up at last, at the dance studio, with a real soul mate, a needy woman who is as timid, as homely-looking, and as gauche as he, the Worm, himself is.

-- The Peacock, the vain metrosexual who by two decades later has lost both his naturally suave good looks and his hair, too (an hilarious scene in which his wig falls off during attempted love-making rendering that latter loss comically evident!), now by the end of ""Cruising Bar: 2"" still is as uppity and absurd as ever in some ways. However, as things work out, he is able, at least, to affirm his masculinity when he had begun to face the possibility that he might be gay. His experience of ""testing the waters"" of Montr&eacute;al's vibrant gay life are side-splittingly droll, yet without being sexist (although he is!).

On the other hand,

-- The Lion still is close to being as idiotic and juvenile as ever, but he does recognise and appreciate the value of his daughter's love.

These developments bring the second film to a satisfyingly well-rounded conclusion. There is no need to worry that this review has too many ""spoilers""; the wealth of comic invention in the two movies and of so many unanticipated plot twists and abundant comic detail within the films far exceed the rough outline of the action which this review indicates.

The special features of ""Cruising Bar: 2"" are longer and more extensive than the short ones which are included with ""Cruising Bar: [1]"" (in both cases only in French, without subtitles for that part of each DVD's content). Since the bonus features with the second film concern both movies, they fill in the viewer's understanding of the earlier motion picture as well as of the sequel.",1411344000,,7317,4.944625407166124

Michel Cote is amazing with his ""transformations"" in characters.

This is a French Canadian film.  I did watch it with English dubbing, only cause I don't understand French.  Still thought it was pretty funny.  A film I would buy, but would want the English dubbing and not sub titles.  Personal preferance.

Definitely not for children.",1132790400,,467,4.621951219512195
