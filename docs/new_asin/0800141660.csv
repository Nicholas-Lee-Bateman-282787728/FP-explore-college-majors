168998,5,0800141660,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, it is most certainly a *classic*.  The story of the Daschwood sisters' troubles are told so sweetly- the sisters love each other so much and want each to be happy.  It is funny, too, Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte lighten up any person's day  yet they also make you frustrated for Marianne and Elinor. The scenery and  music in this film are lovely... they portray the spirit of the scene you  are watching.  This movie was what made me a Jane Austen fan. Immediately  after watching S&S I read it and fell in love with Jane Austen. I think  everyone should watch this movie, you will be touched!",915408000,,637,4.431034482758621

169005,1,0800141660,"Middle-aged Emma Thompson is totally miscast as 19 year old Elinor.  I thought Thompson was Elinor's mother at the beginning as the character in the book is only 40. Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress but she would have been more suited to play Elinor's mother or at best, Elinor's older and matronly sister-in-law, Fanny. Furthermore, important characters and subplots are changed or totally eliminated. Consequently, the conclusion of the movie is contrived and forced. I can't see how any fan of Austen could come close to enjoying this mess!",1522108800,,547,5.0777777777777775

I can't see this movie without crying toward the end, and I've seen it at least a dozen times!. I have always loved Alan Rickman and in this film his acting is so nuanced and sensitive it makes me miss him even more, now that he's gone from us.
The scene near the end when Marianne is ill and he goes to get her mother---I defy you to find a more perfectly romantic moment. Upon returning with Mrs. Dashwood, he begins to leave the sick room and (finally, the little nit) Marianne looks up and thanks him. The transformation of his face, fleeting and so real, makes my heart ache.
The very end, the wedding scene, without a word spoken is so beautiful. Again, Alan Rickman's expression of joy is...well, simply wonderful. If you like period films you will love this.",1512432000,3,913,4.376470588235295

The brother took all the funds except a small monthly payment given to house the three women in a small cottage in the country side.  The two daughters fell in love with men who seem to not be available even though everyone is interested in everyone.

All along the story touches a very subtle line of love, the dialogues are exquisite and the story sails along so as to want you to desire a happy ending. Emma Thompson carries the whole movie extremely well. Her personification of Elinor makes you want to love her balance of mind, her broad range of tolerance and ultimately leaves you wishing that she ends up with the love of her life. A powerful romance, a bit of a colonial condescension and an immaculate portrayal of English life makes an unforgettable movie and one that I would recommend anyone to watch.

169051,4,0800141660,"RELEASED IN 1995/96 and directed by Ang Lee, ""Sense and Sensibility"" chronicles events in England circa 1810 after Mr. Dashwood dies and legally leaves his estate to the son by his initial wife, which leaves his second wife and their three daughters relatively destitute. This negatively affects the marriageability of both practical Elinor (Emma Thompson) and romantic Marianne (Kate Winslet). When Elinor falls for the handsome Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) his kin object and put the kibosh on their blossoming relationship. Meanwhile, the noble but aging Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) becomes infatuated with young Marianne, but she is interested in the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise). Imogen Stubbs plays the rival for Edwards interest.

If you're in the mood for period piece drama/romance Sense and Sensibility fills the bill pretty well. It starts great, gets a tad tedious in the middle, but perks up at the end. The English locations/sets and costuming are superlative. You might want to take advantage of the subtitles to make out all the verbiage and keep track of all the names in the slightly convoluted relationship-oriented plot. In any case, its interesting seeing Winslet before her big success with Titanic (1997) and Rickman playing a straight role rather than hamming-it-up as a goofy villain.

THE MOVIE RUNS 136 minutes and was shot entirely in England (Devon, Norfolk, London, Wiltshire, Somerset and Cornwall, with studio work done in Shepperton). WRITERS: Jane Austen (novel) &  Emma Thompson (screenplay) .

I love Austen and this production just revels in the glorious age when respect and consideration were the order of the day in communication between men and women.

169090,5,0800141660,"I've seen all adaptations of this film and this one over twenty times, being my favorite.  I think this to be one of Hugh Grant's best acting achievements.  His ability to get across how awkward he feels in the presence of strangers and how hard it is to even speak out feelings is impressive.  Hugh is a few months older than Emma in real life, and I found her strictness to manners and holding in personal feelings to be a perfect match for the role they both played.  Winslet was absolutely exceptional in playing a double role of first being a young, unsophisticated, unpolished woman to that of one who found her dignity, worth and maturity through Her mistakes and Col. Brandon. Alan Rickman, as Col. Brandon was great, as usual.  He died at only 69 yrs.  He is missed.  Having lived a life that served other's well but met with much hurt and usury he had begun to live a life expecting nothing from anyone; until Marianne.  He allowed her to see the goodness and promise that he held within himself to which both received the joy of love that was so important to each of them.  The mother, little sister, absolutely everyone was so well cast.",1507680000,,1149,4.485576923076923

It does have one funny part in it, that makes me laugh, but I've just never really been able to stay awake until the end, no matter how hard I try.  I'm a fast thinker who likes fast movies though, so give me a soap opera or something like it and I'll fall straight to sleep!  I was happy to give this to my mom for Mother's Day though!  If this movie makes her happy, then it makes me happy!  Just a warning to all of you action lovers out there, this is a very slow movie about women who have nothing and chase after rich men.  It's boring to me, but there's a lot of people in my family who love it.  It's really a nice love story, and it has a lot of good characters and a couple of villains or something like it as well!  It has some wonderful acting in it too!  It's just not something that peaks my interest, but the rest of my family seems to like it!",1496102400,,1024,3.946341463414634

Although it has its merits (beautiful sets, script and locations), and some of the casting is sublime (Alan Rickman, Robert Hardy, Harriet Walter, Imogen Stubbs and Greg Wise are all fantastically cast), there are definite problems with this adaptation. For one, Emma Thompson is just too old to play the part of Elinor convincingly. There, I said it. Some actors, though older than their character, are perfectly capable of selling me on their character's age. Thompson doesn't. She's a lovely actress and writer, just not in this film. I have reservations about Hugh Grant's portrayal of Edward as well. Whhhyyyyyy? What can they have been thinking letting Grant mince, bumble and stutter his way through a romantic hero's lines? Ugh. Edward was never this awkward and klutzy in the book. He's written as introverted and shy, not pathetic.

Someone else mentioned that the large age differences between actors and characters ruined this adaptation for them. Although I obviously agree to some extent, I think most of the actors made the best of it. I don't find, for example, the age gap between Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet distracting. Even Grant is believable as a man in his 20's.

All in all I much prefer the 2008 BBC version of Sense and Sensibility to this. They both have their problems, but at least I can watch that one without cringing.",1485216000,,1548,4.88212927756654

169209,5,0800141660,"I've seen several Jane Austen adaptions throughout the years, and this is by far one of my favorite! I re-watched it recently, and I must say, I appreciate all the extra trivia about this film that Amazon provides. Learning that Emma Thompson (the one and only!) not only acted in this film, but wrote the script, was such a rich piece of information that burrowed this movie even more deeply into my heart. The costumes and settings were beautiful, but the real treat was the musical score. The music danced around the characters, through the trees, and swallowed me in. For those who have seen and appreciated the music in the Kiera Knightly Pride & Prejudice version, this in on par (if not better!).

While I watched and rewatched this when I was younger, it has still been several years since I watched it the last time. I was surprised to find myself moving the couch closer to my tv in a weird attempt to see the actors/actresses' faces better. I think modern day movies (with modern-day big budgets) must have more frequent close-ups of actors'/actresses' faces, because I found myself wishing to see more of those wonderfully subtle, and oh-so-British, fleeting facial expressions. I suppose less camera angles was a budget issue, but even with that, this movie is a timeless classic and well worth anyone who loves a well-told Jane Austen story.",1484611200,22,1355,4.7905982905982905

169405,5,0800141660,"My absolute favorite movie.  The eldest sister Eleanor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) is more conservative where as her younger sister Marianne (Kate Winslet) is one to not hide her feelings.  After the passing of their father, their half brother John Dashwood (James Fleet) and Fanny (Harriet Walter) come to take over the large estate left to the heir who is a son.  Fanny's brother Edward Ferrar's (Hugh Grant) stops to visit on his way back to London.  That's when Eleanor and Edward realize their attraction to one another, but Fanny who is very greedy and seems to want the Dashwood girls cast away from her and ""good society, forces Edward to leave stating that his mother needs him.""  I love the sisterly affection, and guidance by their mother for the girls to do right by one another.  The youngest daughter Margaret (Emilie Francois) plays a wonderful part as the shy youngest sister thrust into a sad world of losing her father, then their home.  Edward pulls her out of sadness, and starts a friendship with Margaret.  I love this movies for so many reasons, and it will remain my favorite always.  I hope others feel the same way.

A few characters are eliminated, (and of course the lovely and brilliant Emma Thompson was nowhere near 19 when she played Elinor) but overall it does a remarkable job at being faithful to the novel while still being a living, breathing alive movie.",1456876800,,418,4.726027397260274
169458,5,0800141660,"It is painful to recall that the glorious baritone of Alan Rickman is now no longer with us -- but we do have his presence captured in this endearing interpretation of Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility.""

Emma Thompson *carefully*  adapted her witty screenplay from Miss Austen's classic, and an ardent reader will be satisfied by abundant quotations taken directly from the text.  Thompson's additions do not detract from the beauty of this film, where everything from the wardrobe, settings and *Etiquette* of the Regency period is accurately depicted.  (E.g.: look at the comportment of the ladies when they receive visitors to their cottage.  Even the posing of the hands in their laps reflects authentic 18th century etiquette.)  All of these tiny details produce a film which is a joy to watch.

So please buy this film if you love top-notch acting, accurate costumes, settings, etiquette -- and if you believe, as I do, that Mr. Rickman's Colonel Brandon was one for the ages.",1456790400,2,986,5.012269938650307

Hugh Grant has a starring role, but as usual Rickman steals every scene as Colonel Brandon.  Every character was acted well---full three dimensional players.

I rented this from Amazon and downloaded it to my laptop.  One has 24 hrs to view the video once you start playing it..HOWEVER if you don't finish the video completely (I stopped it 2 minutes before the end) one is able to go back and watch parts of the movie for 5 days!  Just fun to watch Rickman!
Winslet is 19 y/o and this was filmed two years BEFORE Titanic.  Im not much for romance novels and movies, but this screenplay was written by Emma Thompson and was delightful.",1455580800,14,807,4.5625

Emma Thompson, who was 36 at the time, cast herself as a 19 year old, Huge Grant, age 36, was cast as a 23 year old and Alan Rickman, 50, was cast as a 35 year old. In addition, Alan Rickman's love interest Kate Winslet had a 30 year age difference in real life. Imelda Staunton, age 56 in real life, giving birth to her first baby with Hugh Laurie in the movie??? You've got to be kidding me?? Hugh Grant also walked around like he'd broken his neck and had a neck collar on! I've been binge watching Jane Austen movies for the first time and I'm 55. Basically the actors don't match up with the age of the characters. It also felt rushed compared to the 2008 version and the intimate connections of the characters were skipped over.  I'm from the U.S. and I think BBC does Jane Austen books a service! To me, this is a watered down version of a wonderful novel! Do yourself a favor and get the 2008 series on Amazon. I promise you won't be disappointed!!!",1455321600,5,1093,4.305825242718447

I'm not really sure why you put Tom Wilkinson and James Fleet as the starring roles in your description but you'd better start proof reading your copy.  Clearly, they are supporting roles and minor supporting roles at that.  One needs to only look at the cover of the movie to realize who is really staring in the picture.

About the movie, excellent rendition of a much loved story.  The heart of Jane Austin is retained and this wonderful production with the best part still about the characters rather than the period playing the staring role.  Too many period pieces focus on the trappings of the environment and less on the story.  This didn't happen here which pleased me very much!",1453680000,,723,4.774193548387097

My only disappointment is that I let too many years go without watching it again.

169579,2,0800141660,"I only enjoyed the acting, not the messages sent out or the ending. Elinor should have ended up with Brandon however, like many middle aged men, children were more desirable. I am very glad that we do no live in those times anymore. The movie failed to show Willoughby changing and becoming a better man. If he had done so, him and Marianne should have ended up together.

All the books from Austen's time period included encouraging huge age gaps within relationships and somehow making out that love was ever involved. Stockholm syndrome and indoctrination of young girls surely but never love. It was a very ageist society. Girls like Marianne were chosen because of their lack of experience and the fact that they were powerless! Especially if their class was lower and they did not have the wide range of choice that the upper classes had. Even then, parents gave their children off to whoever.

If this was ever going to be good, it should have defied society and matched same age couples together which is the right thing to do always. I'm very grateful for  science and other subjects which came along to give the majority of society common sense. The movie makers and Emma made a mistake by just playing into what the book said. Elinor and Brandon should have ended up together while Marianne and Willoughby grew as young people do and finally find real love.",1446249600,,1368,4.691666666666666

169645,5,0800141660,"This is one of my favorite movies. It is a huge favorite in my family as well.( My sister loves this movie so much, that two of the passages of dialogue and the song ""Weep You No More Sad Fountains"" where in her Wedding!!) I first saw this movie in the Theater; and have since purchased it on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital. Ever current and future children in our family will know parts of this movie by heart; because we are constantly watching it.
Setting aside the stars that are in this film, Emma Thompson did an AMAZING job of bringing this Jane Austin Classic to life. The only true complaints I have are mainly factual inaccuracies. ( such as the scene when they are discussing where the Nile begins; and some of the clothing)
For me, this was a lovely film to watch, and keep watching. It is well acted and well cast. I Love Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon. For me this was one of the first films where he Truly played a Good guy AMAZINGLY.(Though he is AWSOME as a Bad guy. ie: Sheriff Of Nottingham) My younger family members point out the Harry Potter actors all the time. This would be the first of many films that Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman would be in together.
Some of the best moments in this film where added in by Emma Thompson; and are not in the original book. Such as Brandon caring the ill Marianne.
The set designers, costumers, make-up artist, and all the crew did a wonderful job in bringing this film to life.
The song ""Weep You No More Sad Fountains"" is a favorite in our homes (Both the Kate Winslet version and others)
This movie as well as ""Pride & Prejudice"" (Colin Firth version, of course) are MUST see's for everyone.",1442361600,14,1657,4.383116883116883

This is my very favorite version of all. I have watched this movie several times, because the script, directing and actors are paired together perfectly and I find that they all give so much to each character in the 2 short hours that it runs.
I normally do not rate anything 5 stars, but I feel this timeless movie, is worth every star and more. I never tire of watching it and will truly miss it when it leaves Amazon Prime in September. British Period Pieces are really wonderful, allowing the audiance to escape the modern world madness and voyage back to a time of simplicity. Bravo Emma Thompson for her splenid role as Miss Dashwood, and creating a script with such a diversion of charcters with a cast that fit so perfectly together.",1441324800,3,886,4.4753086419753085

Even though some details are different from the book (character ages, characters omitted, etc) I absolutely love this version and prefer it to the 2008 version. Emma Thompson did a fantastic job capturing the emotions from the novel and bringing them to the screen. Coupled with the amazing soundtrack by Patrick Doyle, this would be a great gift for any Jane Austen fan.",1435708800,,470,4.476744186046512

169928,3,0800141660,"A reasonable mounting of this classic Jane Austen tale. This might've been superlative except for the script, which fails to cover some of the ground in the novel that was necessary to the successful execution of the story. The most egregious failure is in the conflict between Edward Farrars and his mother, who controls the family inheritance; it never gets enough traction to matter, even though that's essential to the resolution of his and Elinor's part of the drama. As for the casting, Kate Winslet was good as the willfully romantic Marianne, Emma Thompson did well enough with the somewhat ill-fitting Elinor, Alan Rickman was interesting as the frustrated Colonel Brandon, and Robert Hardy was spot on as the boisterous and expansive Sir John Middleton. The one outright misstep was Hugh Grant as Edward Farrars; he did his best to seem shy and retiring, but came off stiff and uncomfortable, as though he was surprised and unprepared to find himself stuffed into period costume and shoved in front of the camera.",1435276800,,1023,4.988304093567251

169962,3,0800141660,"Sense and Sensibility is my favorite Austen novel, but this is not the adaptation to watch if you want an ideal and romantic match to the book. Emma Thompson is too old for the part of Elinor, and Hugh Grant is not believable as Edward Ferrars; there's no chemistry between those two either. Kate Winslet is excellent as Marianne as is Emilie Francois as Margaret.

169999,5,0800141660,"Ang Lee outdid himself with this film.  Other than Emma Thompson being perhaps a little bid too old to truly play Elinor Dashwood (although she was excellent in the role, her acting skills cannot be denied), the film was beautifully done, the acting skillful, the story told with heart and finesse.  This novel by Jane Austen has often been slighted in favor of her better known ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but it is just a fine a story and actually, more heart-wrenching, because it explores what happens to a family of women who are cast from a life of luxury into a life of ""gentile poverty"" and only have a roof over their heads (a rather shoddy roof at that) thanks to the beneficence of one of Mrs. Dashwood's cousins.  It is a true revelation of how cruel was society and the culture of early 19th century England.  The scene that got me when I initially saw this movie in a theatre, and it still does no matter how many times I've watched this film since then, is the scene where that takes place in the bedroom where Marianne lies deathly ill and Elinor is tending to her and begs the unconscious Marianne not to leave her alone.

The other miscast was Colonel Brandon...just really made it not enjoyable....made the ending very unsatisfying...and if you've read the book first, you'll truly dislike this cast.",1431734400,,465,4.910256410256411

In my opinion they are caricatures of the men in Austen's novel. Edmund Ferrars is inane, Colonel Brandon too stodgy, Willoughby lacks only mustache-twisting to be a cartoon villain, and Sir John Middleton is more buffoon than ebullient country gentleman.

Most of the cast was wrong for their parts.  Although I like Emma Thompson, she was just too old for the part.  Hugh Grant was just wrong due to the lack of acting abilities.  I did like him in Four Weddings and a Funeral but every movie he is in he acts the same.  Not sure why this has such high ratings for an OK movie.",1427932800,,486,4.182795698924731

I have watched every film version ever made of the Austen novels but watching Sense & Sensibility for probably the third time, I finally started reading! Emma Thompson's screenplay won the Golden Globe and I think the Oscar too and deserved as much. Her gentlemen played so competently by Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman are of course far more attractive than the gents drawn by Austen but who cares!

My husband watched it to the end, pretended it was silly, but he secretly liked it. It might be a chick movie, but Emma Thompson's screenplay of an otherwise dull book is so good, that I was truly interested in every thing and every body's troubles.

170308,5,0800141660,"I'd been putting off watching this version od Sense & Sensibility for a long time. I'm not a big Hugh Grant of Emma Thompson fan. I'm regretting the fact that I waited so long.

This Jane Austen tale is the story of two sisters, Elinor (Thompson) and Marianne (Winslet; how they fall in love, how they deal with it, and what they learn from it. The two sisters are vastly different people. Elinor is proper but not stuffy or stiff, quiet but not shy, and observant of the time's conventions. Emma Thompson did an amazing job inserting herself into the role. I'd previously seen the BBC version and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to overlook the age discrepancy of Thompson playing Elinor. I shouldn't have been fearful. Thompson's performance was flawless.

And then we have Marianne. Marianne is very passionate, artistic, and very wrapped up in her ideas of the way she thinks things should be. She can't see beyond her own judgements and doesn't understand people who are not like her. One one hand I liked that Marianne shirks conventions and what is expected of her to follow her heart. On the other hand I found her to be very immature and frustrating. Basically, Kate Winslet does a fantastic job of playing Marianne as a woman who hasn't yet had her ideas challenged or bumped up against the real world.

As is befitting one so dramatic, Marianne become wrapped up in a love triangle of sorts while Elinor's love is quiet and secret. The way these ladies go about being in love is like looking at opposite ends of a spectrum. Facial expressions and moments are captured beautifully and there is as much said in the quiet moments as in the moments when words are being spoken. That's what a film, a drama should be.

I highly recommend this adaptation and I wish I would have seen it sooner. As it is, I will be watching it again very soon.",1421798400,,1851,4.54954954954955
170309,5,0800141660,"This movie is so fabulous that there is no need to add more. So this is about the blu-ray, which, while not being demo quality, does justice to the beauty of the English countryside and the wonderful houses. I was concerned that it would not play in a Region 1 player but I took a chance with the listing A/B/C and I had no problem with it. I am thrilled to have it in blu at last.",1421452800,4,381,3.961038961038961
170310,5,0800141660,"I loved all of Jane Austen's book's, and so I've seen every movie based on her books. This ""Sense and Sensibility""is chock full of the best actors, and Emma Thompson not only played ""Elinor"", she also wrote the screenplay, and won the 1995 Oscar for it. The movie was also nominated for 6 other Academy Awards. And the movie won the Golden Globe Award for the Best Picture, and The Best Screenplay. So of course, I loved this movie, myself.",1421366400,,440,4.5125

Other than the series of ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, this is the best adaptation of her work. Ang Le does a surprisingly astute job of directing--he knows exactly how to frame a scene  and when to tell a story without words. And Emma Thompson pared down Austen's novel while losing none of the charm and wit. I love this movie (and who knew Kate Winslett could sing?)",1420416000,,509,4.850574712643678

The acting is top grade.  Emma also had a part in the  producing of this little gem.  I certainly would recommend it over any of the newer renditions of Sense & Sensibility.",1409616000,,347,4.276923076923077

170383,3,0800141660,"This movie was just ok, Not Bad, But Not great either.  The acting was good, including Emma Thompson and Winslet. What really made a mess of this movie was Hugh Grants portrayal and also the fact that he is barely at all present in the movie much at all, and when he is, the stiffness and stuttering, mumbling of his speech is right down atrocious, incomprehensible. Does the book itself also portrays him this way?? At any rate, the lack of character development or engagement between these two characters almost completely Kills this movie if it wasn't for the fine acting of others in the movie. There is no chemistry at all between them, and that really was a major letdown. Specially after seeing the Pride and Prejudice with keira, or the same Sense and Sensibility PBS version, its not even close to the depth of detail, choreography, music score, character development that those had. In other words, this was a mediocre movie... at best.",1408492800,,946,4.733333333333333

1.) This version of the film IS all region, but comes from the UK (I think). As a result the disc is ugly and emblazoned with all kinds of odd logos and labels. I guess that's just the way UK discs look?

2.) I know EXACTLY the proper way to watch HD films on my television (at 24fps, thank you). However, even though I have it at this setting (the setting all non-live films are supposed to look), there was still a bit of a problem during the rainy scene where Marianne meets Willoughby for the first time. It almost looked as if the remastering didn't do a good job and ended up making the scene look as though it were set to a blurry 48fps.",1399420800,4,762,4.039735099337748

Also, the director's voiceover on the DVD (with Emma Thompson), addresses the look of the film too and a whole host of fascinating details.

170454,2,0800141660,"I absolutely love all of the actors cast in this film, but they were terribly miscast for these roles. Elinor Dashwood was 19 years old. Marianne Dashwood was 16. When this film was made, Emma Thompson was 36 (!!) and Kate Winslet 20. Elinor and Marianne are sisters, not mother and daughter! While Emma is a fabulous woman and an amazing actress, this is almost as embarrassing as when her then-husband Kenneth Branagh played 19 year old Hamlet at 36. When a young man asks ""To be or not to be..."" that is part of growing up. When a man in his 30s asks the same question, that's just pathetic. But I digress... The film also strays too far from Austen's sublime text. Even the normally delightful Hugh Grant is in way over his head with this adaptation.

170460,5,0800141660,"Jane Austen provides us with an enchanting picture of what life would be like, if we did not have to work or struggle to make ends meet. Our servants satisfy that requirement of existence. We merely need to manage our financial affairs through adroitly structuring and arranging our romantic relationships. That said, there is much beauty, civility, and harmony in this portrayal of Victorian England British soldiers whose lives were not so idyllic no doubt made this abundance possible by keeping the colonies in line.  But no matter-- this elegant way of life, will perhaps be possible for all of us, once our robots are able enough.
Ang Lee (the director) impresses with the graceful and gentle flowing  of hope and yearning into sorrow  and confusion into redemption and fulfillment. The actors are superb. Select this film when you spirit need uplifting.",1393977600,,860,5.042253521126761

170463,5,0800141660,"I love this movie! So many talented actors in it! At least 3 of them were in the Harry Potter series; besides Emma Thompson & Alan Rickman, Imelda Staunton, who was Prof. Dolores Umbridge, played the wife of Hugh Laurie (another excellent actor).

I found the book with the pictures from the film at an estate sale & snapped it up immediately. Now, I will plan to buy the movie to go in my ""Classics"" collection.",1393545600,,412,4.421052631578948
170464,5,0800141660,"Big Austen fan and Sense and Sensibility is my second favorite novel by her.  This adaptation is fabulous....done with a sensitivity to the materials and a light touch from the director who lets his actors shine in their portrayals of these wonderful characters.  Every adaptation of a book requires changes because the medium is so different, but the selections made by Emma Thompson in this screenplay are WONDERFUL.  Probably my favorite book to screen adaptation.",1393545600,,467,5.2

170467,4,0800141660,"I would say that this is the essence of Sense and Sensibility, rather than an absolutely faithful reproduction of Jane Austen's work. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it very much. If the story was to be squeezed into a couple of hours, cuts would have to be made and a few non-essential characters were left out entirely, without harm to the plot. Presenting Sir John as a widower, thereby omitting his insipid wife and rambunctious young children, caused the screenwriter to take liberties with Jane Austen's original story, and some of the characters delivered lines that were actually spoken by other characters, but at least Jane Austen's words were used. In the book, Margaret Dashwood, the youngest of the three sisters, is barely mentioned but in this movie she is given a more prominent role with scenes that are obviously not from the pen of Jane Austen. However, her part was portrayed by such a pretty, charming and accomplished young actress that the alteration added to my enjoyment. The only part I wish was better acted was Elinor's crying breakdown. It was not an option, but I would have liked to have given this four and a half points because it was not perfect enough to earn five. If you like historical romances, this is well worth watching!",1392854400,,1254,4.810185185185185

Above all it demonstrates the importance of persistence in working towards a good outcome in spite of disasters along the way. The story has a happy ending only after intense difficulties.

She has updated the story for the modern audience, and has given it more humor and charm. Thompson actually added a younger sister to the Dashwood family for some comic relief, and it works wonderfully.

170546,5,0800141660,"""Sense and Sensibility"" is good adaptation of one of Jane Austen's most beloved novels. Jane Austen always found a way to create the most impossible situations imaginable to push her characters to the limit. This is the story of Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Elinor (Emma Thompson) and their unlucky situation in life. Due to their father dying they are virtually left homeless except for a small amount of money to live on each year. The story begins with a dramatic deathbed wish and you just know things are not going to work out for the best immediately. What surprised me was how funny this movie is when at times it is a near tragedy. Also the English countryside is so beautiful and there are a couple scenes in the amazing family library. Throughout this movie you will be on the edge of your seat wondering what could go wrong next. There are so many twists and turns in the story that it makes the movie absolutely fascinating. The men in this movie are also very interesting. They range from flaky to extremely chivalrous. Some of them also seem more swayed by money than love. Marianne and Elinor also must endure extreme emotional distress before they get what they want. But in the end you could not wish for a better conclusion.

Although it pales in comparison to the  BBC Masterpiece version, as movie, it is one of the better big screen adaptations of Jane Austen's work.  Although Emma Thompson did a decent job with the screen play, i don't like the fact that she made a concerted effort to model  Edward Ferrars' personality around Hugh Grant's celebrity persona. Emma Thompson was 37 when this movie was released and she looks great, but she would have been better suited for the role of Mrs Dashwood. I don't understand why they made the decision to cast her as 19 year old Elinor, she just doesn't pull it off, and i found it distracting. If you are an Austin purist, and you haven't watched either version, my advice would be......start with the movie. If you watch Masterpiece first, you will have a difficult time enjoying the movie",1373155200,3,877,4.681818181818182

170586,5,0800141660,Being an Austin fan there is no way to not watch all the movies made about her books.  I loved this story.  I was very impressed with the way the director brought the interplay between the two sisters into the movie.  Very good!,1372204800,,228,4.255813953488372
170587,5,0800141660,"This is my very favorite version of Sense & Sensibility. My friends think I'm crazy for having such a crush on 67-year-old Alan Rickman, since they only know him as Severus Snape. But I defy any woman to watch his turn as Colonel Brandon and not come away at least a little in love.

On the subject of Harry Potter: If you are a fan, I highly encourage you to see this, even if the genre usually isn't your bag. It's worth it to see Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) as the daughter of Madam Pomfrey (Gemma Jones); the original Fat Lady (the late, great Elizabeth Spriggs), who gossips with Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) and is the mother of Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton...who is surprisingly likeable here as a funny, shallow, vapid woman of the time); and, of course, the aforementioned Professor Snape (the honey-voiced, unrivaled Alan Rickman).

For House fans: Hugh Laurie is well cast as the long-suffering and acidly humorous Mr. Palmer, husband of Imelda Staunton's Charlotte Jennings Palmer. Bonus: He gets to use his real accent!

This is a bit of perfection all around...give it a try and you won't be sorry!",1372118400,3,1127,4.798969072164948

The Andrew Davies screenplay is good, but there are insertions into the story of meaningless salacious bits and the portrayal of Willoughby and Brandon pale in comparison to the above movie. We have watched this one a couple of times, but that's it.",1370822400,,529,4.739130434782608

That is most likely due to the better technical production equipment, etc.  The music was one of my favorite parts.  Marianne was romantic still but not quite as outspoken and petulant as earlier versions presented her except when it came to Willoughby.  This version is true to the story line with some condensation of information but it is a wonderful happy ever after movie with beautiful music.

170614,5,0800141660,"Although this movie is not absolutely true to the book, the changes made are wonderful and add greatly to the enjoyment of the movie. I believe that Ms Thompson caught the emotion of the story very well and enhanced it with both her writing of the script and her acting in it. Her character is the driving force of the story and her portrayal is perfect. I know she was a bit old for the role but she looked lovely and fit the role perfectly. She can say more with silence than any actress I've ever seen. This is a wonderful cast with every single person ""spot on"" in their performance. It is beautifully filmed. I've looked at it many times and it makes every other production of this book just seem boring. I was a little perplexed by the way  Hugh Grant seemed to creep around on his toes sort of bent forward in most scenes but I assume that is what he was directed to do. He certainly made a charming and believable Eward Ferrars and that is what is important. I thought Alan Rickman was wonderful as Col. Brandon and I've never seen Marianne portrayed better than Kate Winslet did it. She gave it just the correct touch of young love out of control and unable to help her behavior.

170615,5,0800141660,"I've seen Jane Austen's 1970's production of Sense And Sensibility and enjoyed it. But this movie truly promotes the book on which it's based. The performances and the setting are outstanding.

I commend Emma Thompson for how she wrote the screenplay. The humor is so delicate as it inspires laughter. Although it's not a tear-jerker for me, it very well may be for somebody else. The book's plot is so well-carried out in the movie that it uncovers the hearts of many women, who have found themselves searching for love in the modest and bashful manner which we were taught long before the boldness of this generation erupted.

Mrs. Jennings is the funniest character in the movie. While she is as non-scandalous as the proper society required especially women to be in their time, she borders on ""non-scandalous"". She loves gossip, and as thirteen year-old Margaret points out, ""She talks about things."" I think almost every main character, except for snobbish Fanny and her spineless husband, is evaluated by Mrs. Jennings, who is not shy about expressing her thoughts. Loveable character.

Another favorite of mine is Colonel Brandon. He is an ideal man (yet in disguise by a very humble nature) for any woman with a craving for true romance in her life, like Marianne.

I never would have read the book before seeing the movie. But now... I recommend them both (and the previous movie version if available now).",1367366400,,1416,4.8875

Grant one, it is not clear why Marianne Dashwood ends up with the Colonel.  The reason this one is a better version is that, although the series S&S is wonderful, the Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant version has better looking more warm characters.

Both daughters are forced by their circumstances to be neurotically desparate to find husbands, and their wretchedness is emphasized by the slightly ""too"" old Elinor. Whether the character was that old in the book, I don't care. That detail works perfectly in this screen version.

Another interesting fact is that all the men in the movie seem to be victims of the crazy world they've created. The Hugh Grant character tiptoes around like he's about to topple over at any moment. The colonel is in his own kind of daze. The married men are miserable or driven to looniness or mean-spiritedness. The only free spirit is the younger sister's early suitor, but of course he's punished by both his society and his conscience for his behavior.",1365984000,,871,4.8

I am not an expert on the period but Thompson makes me believe she and her production staff are.  For an Anglophile, the beautiful English countryside is as much a character as the players.

I know you can't fit a whole book into a 2-hour movie without changing a few things, and I think they did a pretty good job of keeping the story straight. Most of the characters were believable EXCEPT I really took issue with Emma Thompson as Elinor - I'm sorry, she is just WAY TOO OLD! She would have been better as Mrs. Dashwood, who, if you remember from the book, was in her 40's and still attractive. The other actor that bothered me was Alan Rickman as Col. Brandon. In the book he seemed to be a softer, more genial character, but Alan Rickman's portrayal was too harsh (and his looks are a tad harsh - I don't think he smiled once in the whole movie, except maybe in the last scene).  So ... I would recommend it but whith those caveats.",1361145600,,837,4.134969325153374

The background on Austen is likewise well covered.  I will only add my praise of Thompson's excellent speech at the Golden Glove ceremony.

170664,4,0800141660,"Emma Thompson, one of my favorite artists and in my opinion, beautiful, was too old to play this part.  Because of her acting skill, the movie was not ruined for me by that, but I kept noticing it.  Ms. Thompson, though not at all old, projects maturity, and Gemma Jones projects younger than she was when this film was made, so even though I hadn't read the book, I kept thinking that Mrs. Dashwood must have birthed Elinor as a teenager.  That was okay for me, but Elinor always seemed 30 in this version of the story, and I kept thinking she would have been considered a spinster by that age and so I didn't understand why her dying father spoke of a dowry for her.  In appearance, a 30 year old Elinor would have long ago had a season, and obviously not married.  She seemed in appearance and behavior, more an aunt to Marianne, and a younger sister to Mrs. Dashwood, though in the story she was sister and daughter.  Anyway, despite the miscasting, I still liked this film, it has many of the actresses/actors I love in it, and everyone did a good job.  I'm happy Ms. Thompson took the part, but it would be nice to see a remake of this screenplay with age appropriate actors - it would likely be even a better movie, provided the actresses/actors are as fine as those in this production.  I've watched it many times and I think my favorite character is Lucy, because she comes from a disadvantaged background and time for women, and just by using her wits, manages to marry well, which in her time was like winning the lottery.  She was the most proactive female character, and I like women action characters, though I usually don't like gold diggers, Lucy has so few options in the 19th century for meaningful work, that marrying well was one of the few respectable options she had for a decent life for herself.  With very few protectors, no great beauty and no education, she married well.  I was pleased the Dashwood girls married well too.  I know I was supposed to feel more deeply for the Dashwood family as they had a reversal of fortune with the death of their beloved husband/father, but even in their financial straits of only 500 pounds a year, they lived in a two story house with two servants, and ate well with their rich relatives as often as they chose.  So they suffered a reversal, but they weren't homeless or without income.  I know the filmmakers tried to show a real fall into poverty, but though they suffered a loss of a beloved family member, whom they never mentioned after they left their family home, it's hard to think of people with two servants as poor, though they were undoubtedly poorer.  Mostly Elinor seemed slightly overly bossy towards Marianne (as if in anticipation of Marianne's disappointment - something I dislike in film, when a character forecasts something too early in the story), and Kate Winslet, though young, seemed older than a super naive 16 year Marianne.  Willouby was not all that impressive to me either - as Marianne's first boyfriend; I think his part should have been written with the care that Edward's part was written - it was clear why Elinor liked Edward; it would have been good to show the reasons Marianne adored Willouby.  I think Willouby carrying Marianne home after she sprained her ankle was to be proof of something, but it was not enough, I needed more Willouby time, more things he actually did that showed why he was so appealing.  After all, Emma Thompson did not just rely on Hugh Grants good looks to show why she was fond of Edward, she showed in the story why Edward's character was so appealing.  With an Elinor too bossy for little reason, and Marianne crushed by a Willouby who was underwritten, it was hard to attach completely to the story, but I attached partially enough to enjoy it, mostly due to the well written Elinor/Edward romance, and the fine acting by all. I'd give it a three and a half stars.",1360540800,,3899,4.5522174535050075

Ema Thompson does an exceptional job portraying the older sister, Elinor. Kate Winslet does a fine job as Marianne, the romantic younger sister. The story cleverly illustrates the manners, mores and morals of  society at the time, as well as the disadvantages of being a female. The story is built around the tragic death of the girl's father and the family fortunes being ""entailed"" to the eldest son of his previous marriage. The two girls and their mother have to give up their home and are economically at the mercy of a half-brother who barely knows them and the brother's greedy wife, who has no sympathy for the girls, their mother.or the situation.

In a society where women are denied autonomy, they must rely on the kindness of in-laws and pray for advantageous marriages.  Nevertheless, Elinor and Marianne hold on to the hope that they will marry for love and not merely economic gain.

This engaging and moving film, brilliantly acted, functions for much of its length as a scathing indictment of a time when the circumstances of talented and intelligent women were almost entirely dependent on the men in their lives.  However, it becomes complicit in this unfortunate social institution (spoiler ahead) with its ending, in which the sisters achieve happiness by marrying the right men.

My first Jane Austen book was ""Pride and Prejudice"" and after that, I could not make myself read any of her others thinking NOTHING could top P & P.  So years went by before I read ""S & S"".  After reading the book, I thought ""I have to see that movie again""!  I knew the story would be so much more meaningful after having read the book, and I was right.  The movie is so wonderful--the details they got so right in the clothes, houses and furnishings, the actors who played the parts, the way it was written (thank you Emma!)--all are excellent.

The picture quality for this blu-ray is stunning in places, and not-so-stunning in other places (a bit soft here and there).  But every second of it is gorgeous compared with the DVD release, which was bad even by SD standards.  But hang on to the DVD for Emma Thompson's witty commentary, because it's not on the blu-ray.

This is one of my five favorite films, and I was psyched outta my head to see it look so sharp, so I may not be a level-headed reviewer, but in the parts (about 80% of the run time) where the picture quality is very good, I thought I was looking at one of the best looking movies I'd ever seen.  I saw little facial gestures and nuanced physical acting I hadn't noticed in my umpteen previous viewings on DVD.  The colors of the country-side, the outfits, the foods, the horses, and the decor of the homes, taken altogether in the rhythm and tone that Ang Lee presents here, is a real marvel.  Seeing (and hearing) it on blu-ray, I was swept back to 1995 when I was knocked out by it at the movie theater.  This is an underrated masterpiece in my opinion.

Friends invited me to their place following a personal tragedy, and as a way to distract me, they played this movie for me on their big-screen DVD player. It did in fact manage to distract me, especially recognizing Snape (Alan Rickman) in the person of Colonel Brandon. Hey, he's a nice guy in this picture!

There are no villains, really. There are only people, such as Willoughby, who are pressed by circumstances into being cruel to those who love them. Everyone is very, very civilized, actually, the way only the British can be.

No, I take that back: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, the beautiful Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet respectively, have a sister-in-law who is truly evil. But then, she dresses the part, and sounds the part: you can't miss her.

Here's a curious fact: Emma Thompson got a Golden Globe AND an academy award, but not for her acting. She also wrote the screenplay. The DVD includes her speech upon acceptance of the Golden Globe, and it is a classic. In it, she acknowledges that they owe it all to Jane Austen, and then asks what Miss Austen would say if she were there. She then read her (Jane Austen's) speech, and it was perfect! It sounded just like her, and was amusing with the dry wit that makes her books so delightful.

Anyway, I have no hesitation in giving Sense & Sensibility a full five stars. It is a beautiful movie in all respects. I am especially crazy about the costumes.",1337558400,,1470,4.620689655172414

He is hesitant and shy but it is implied that he opens up and becomes deeply engaged with Elinor- on a one to one with someone you are comfortable with, shyness largely disappates.  Well, except for the end in which he is charming, he portrays Edward as stuttering and almost buffoonish- and NOT someone attractive.  All they had to do was show them interacting and conversing and having intelligent interaction as couples who like one another do.  Edward had to be ultimately likeable and attractive for the story to work so this was extremely dumb and happened no doubt because the book has to be read carefully to infer the type of person that Austen intended for the story to make sense.

But thats where my praise ends.  My problem is my bias towards Emma Thompson, I have a hard time trusting anything done by this woman. Thompson is a Godless, illogical, JEW-hating, under-educated, hypocritical, Nut Case who thinks using spray under-arm deodorant every morning is warming the globe (which may be part of the reason BRANAUGH dumped her..lol). She bought land trying to block increasing runway space at england's largest airport. But then turns around to fly first class from the same airport (VIP express on boarding) to hollywood to get some silly award for play-acting. She supports the same Palestinian Terrorists that would love to blow her out of the sky in her comfy first class seat, and thinks those Jews getting killed by rockets and living in fear of these same people in Isreal deserve it. She adopts some African kid, to prove she's not racist, and demands England destroy itself by becoming a more ""diverse"" nation by flooding it with people from third world countries, instead of helping those same countries advance on their own. JANE AUSTEN once said she (parapharashed) ""wrote stories about the small world's of peoples lives"". I think THOMPSON is living in a very small ""self-hating"" world and is trying to spread her hate. So forgive me JANE AUSTEN LOVERS (which I am One), im giving this version of SENSE and SENSIBILITY a ONE STAR in PROTEST.",1333843200,6,1687,4.878048780487805

 The movie itself, as a period drama is first class!  Although it isn't completely faithful to the book, it is my favorite of the adaptations I've seen ('07, and '81).  The casting is superb (although 2 of the actors were a bit older than their book counterparts); and their acting leaps & bounds better than the '81!  The scenery, and stately homes are stunning!!  Also, the soundtrack fits the period, and compliments the storyline very well.

 Most likely, if the viewer hasn't read the book, the alterations, and missing characters shouldn't affect their opinion much.
_______

**SPOILER ALERT**

As for the (most notable) missing scenes/parts:

  - Willoughby's visit, and conversation with Elinor at Cleveland (during Marianne's sickness).  The movie tried to rectify it by way of Col. Brandon.  After his revealing Willoughby's seduction of his ward to Elinor, he proceeds to tell her he inquired, and has reason to believe that Willoughby's intentions were not entirely as dishonorable toward Marianne.
..It's not quite as satisfying as hearing it come from Willoughby himself though.

  - Edward's week stay, not long after they arrived (on his way back from visiting Lucy in Plymouth).  The book scene conveyed the troubled mind of Edward, and his internal conflicting feelings as regards Elinor, and Lucy.
And provided a hint of what was to come, with the lock of hair seen by all in his ring (which he passed off as Fanny's, and the Dashwood sisters supposed he somehow obtained a lock of Elinor's without her knowing).

- The dinner party with Mrs. Ferrars & Jennings, the Dashwood's, Steels', and Middleton's.  Not a major loss there, being that Fanny made it clear at the beginning that their mother expected Edward to marry a woman of means and fortune, otherwise suffer being disinherited.
  And before revealing her engagement, Lucy told Elinor she finally met Mrs. Ferrars (after being invited to stay with the J. Dashwood's in London).
______

  The missing characters:

  I personally don't mind the fact that Lady Middleton (& children) were left out (the movie stated Sir John was a widower).

In the book, Miss Austen describes her as ""(though perfectly well bred,) she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place enquiry or remark"".
 With that said, it wasn't that much of a loss to leave her out being that she and Mrs. (John) Dashwood were so much alike (""there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathized with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanour, and a general want of understanding"").
In the book, all she really did was dote on her children, and play hostess.

  They also left out the other Miss Steel, which wasn't a big deal either.  The movie showed Lucy spilling her secret to Fanny instead.",1332720000,,3109,4.83111954459203

170735,4,0800141660,"Along with the famous Andrew Davies BBC/A&E miniseries of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was the first of the famous series of adaptations in the mid 90s that sparked a kind of cultural Jane Austen boom. It was also considered at the time one of the best, although its pretty-pretty costumes, sets and cinematography were soon supplemented in the imagination(almost blessedly) by the terrifically gritty and muddy BBC version of PERSUASION helmed by Roger Mitchell. Even so, the exquisite prettiness of this Ang Lee-directed version presents one vision of Jane Austen very dear to many readers' hearts, and the deservedly Oscar-winning screenplay by Emma Thompson brings out much of the novel's great humor as well as its poignancy, and makes the plot's many twists and turns compelling.

Many Austen scholars at the time noted that Thompson (then thirty-six) was too old to be quite believable at the elder and more stoic of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor; but the difference in marriageability ages in the late 20th century seems to account better now for the disparity in Thompson's age and that of her heroine. Similarly, though Hugh Grant was faulted in 1995 for pulling a more pronounced version of his usual adorably bashful stammering shtick as Elinor's admirer, Edward Ferrars, in retrospect it seems quite approrpiate to the character (and helps explain why he has such difficulty making his love for Elinor known in his earlier scenes). What has not improved over time is the odd casting of Alan Rickman as the more faithful of Marianne's beaux, Colonel Brandon: his sinister and slow delivery (used to such beautiful effect in other films) seems oddly out of whack, such that by the end it seems almost as if the Dashwoods are marrying poor Marianne off to a second Bluebeard. Much more successful are the impossibly dashing Greg Wise (Thompson's romantic partner after this film) as Willoughby, the estimable Harriet Walter as Mrs. John Dashwood, Hugh Laurie as an amusingly sour Mr. Palmer, and Elizabeth Spriggs as the impossibly vivacious Mrs. Jennings. The highest performing honors belong to Emma Thompson, ideally cast as the patient Elinor, and Kate Winslet as her emotional sister Marianne: it is a testament to both women's skills that, though they had played very similar roles recently before this film that had made enormous impacts (Thompson as the sisterly and wise Margaret Schlegel in HOWARDS END, and Winslet as the overwrought teenager Juliet Hulme in HEAVENLY CREATURES), their performances in this film are quite distinct from those earlier successes.",1330819200,,2594,5.161520190023753

In my view, Lee has done many good movies but if it comes to masterpieces, there are two that are far above the rest: Lust caution and Sense and Sensibility.

Armed with this visual refinement that goes back to James Ivory (What Remains the day) and rate of rhythmic cadences, Ang Lee undertakes the Herculean task of bringing to the screen so English a work like this.

And the end result was sublime. The repertoire is perfect, the scenery is simply mesmerizing, the accurate and incisive dialogues. Thus, Lee takes advantage of laying bare the background of social conventions so characteristic of the time and puritanical double standard that nested in every corner of the households is in Devonshire and London.

Two sisters, impoverished after the death of his father in the flesh feel the stares, gossip and the scorn of a wealthy class in England in the nineteenth century.

Being on a Hugh Grant kick lately I watched three of his films all in the same week. Love Actually, Sense & Sensibility, and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Fun way to watch these movies because of the overlap in players and to understand classic British style: themes include tension between being proper and true to oneself, a wide cast of characters all intertwined, somehow, uncertainty of who will end up with who, extreme, offbeat secondary characters that are almost caricatures, and everything wrapped up neatly in the last 5-10 minutes of the film. Another commonality seems to be a randomness of billings, in this one Grant was given a top billing and a picture on the DVD cover, but was very much a secondary character. More talked about than actually shown. In his scenes he was so constrained/proper that it was almost painful to watch.

170757,4,0800141660,"Despite the fact that much of Austen's language from ""Sense and Sensibility"" is not included in this film, the spirit and soul of her characters and plot remain. Since this was Austen's first attempt at writing, much of her language is stilted to the modern ear and Ms. Thompson's rewrite for the screenplay makes it flow in a more sensible fashion. It's filmed in loving detail by Ang Lee, saturated in light, Kate Winslet's Marianne and Emma Thompson's Elinor shine in their roles as siblings and the complications that arise from that relationship. A ""new"" sister, Margaret, is added to explain the culture of the period as she blurts out questions that the modern audience may be thinking to have the family answer.

Imelda Staunton and Hugh Laurie as the Palmers are a wonderful foil to the rather silly manners of the day and Greg Wise provides a delicious villian as the rogue Willoughby. Hugh Grant as love interest Edward is underplayed; this role was cast before his big splash in ""Notting Hill."" And Alan Rickman as Marianne's suitor was just lovely.

Yes, this is chick flick-no explosions, no one killed, no blood. Just a story about human relationships, overcoming adversity, and a bit of romance.",1301184000,4,1211,4.87378640776699

170764,5,0800141660,"Although the Pride and prejudice tv series with Colin Firth and Jenifer Ehle impressed me, I have to admit that my favorite adaptation of a Jane Austen novel remains Emma Thompson's and Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility.

This movie is an adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel in which three sisters, named Elinor, Marianne, Margaret, and their mother have to move out of their home and relocate in a small cottage, due to the death of their father whose house has become the property of their brother-in-law and of his avaricious wife. At the same time, Elinor and Marianne both fall in love with gentlemen, played by Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise, (who became in real life the husband of Emma Thompson herself) and whose lives are not what they seem to be.

As I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, I just want to say that what really impressed me was how Ang Lee managed to keep his direction very simple. There are no useless close-ups, no overbearing music and no over acting with his actors. Instead, he just lets them interpret their roles in the most subtlest way. And, unlike certain Jane Austen adaptations, Ang Lee doesn't use flashbacks to explain incidents that occur in the past or to enrich the character's dialogues. Instead, he just lets the actors speak and explain what happened. Finally, Ang Lee's shots look just like asian paintings and add details that were not included in the novel, but enhance the context of the british society in Jane Austen's novel, such as the grand ball which instead of occurring in a big room, happens through different rooms, each divided by a certain social status.

As for Emma Thompson's very funny script, she manages to condense the novel's plot in two hours, with such efficiency that she doesn't lose any of the important elements of the story. Not only that, she also gives room to certain characters like Margaret, and even enriches the story with scenes that never occurred in the book, like the discussion between Elinor and Edward in the library as they manage to get Margaret out of her hiding spot. The scene is so funny and believable in its dialogue that you really think that it was in the book, which was something that a professor, or a viewer I'm not too sure, told Emma Thompson and her producer, something they both revealed in the commentaries on the DVD.

Speaking of special features, I loved the details and information that Emma Thompson and her producer gave in their commentaries, some of which were also noted in the production diaries of the movie. You get to learn more about the movie 's production and also on her work as screenwriter and all the modifications she had to do to transpose the novel into a movie.

Finally, there is, in the special features, an excerpt from the Golden Globes ceremony in 1996, during which Emma Thompson received a prize and did a great speech, imagining what Jane Austen would have said if she had been at that ceremony.

In the end, I don't think the movie would have been as successful and as funny if Emma Thopmson and Ang Lee had not been working on this movie, which really deserved its Oscar for best scriptwriting, Golden Globe, and golden bear at the Berlin film festival.",1294444800,,3214,4.659611992945326

It has, on the whole, a wonderful cast doing a pretty good job, and great production values. Though Hugh Grant seems uncomfortable as Elinor's beloved,  I do love the other Hugh, Hugh Laurie, who rather touchingly reveals something that the novel only suggests:  Mr. Palmer gradually falls more than half in love with Elinor.  (The contrast between Elinor and Mrs. Palmer is painful.)  Emma Thompson's Elinor may be a little older than we might have imagine her, but she beautifully conveys Elinor's isolation and stress--she is so often the only  person of sense in the room.  My biggest complaint is that the scene between Elinor and her sister Marianne's faithless lover Willoughby is pretty weak--Elinor is even closer to forgiving that scoundrel here than she is in the novel.  Miss Austen was far too easy on him, and the film is worse.

If you are a Jane Austen fan, then by all means pick this film up.

The book was very good as well though long and confusing in the beginning at least. I dare say though that just like Pride and Prejudice, you should see the film first before reading the book. It will make the reading so much easier for you in the end.

The story is simple enough. It's about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Marianne is basically open to everyone about everything and Elinore keeps her emotions and feeling in deep check. I am somewhat like Marianne and i've had the most unfortunate experience with an ""Elinor"" of my own who was an absolute complete waste of my time, but i digress.

How could one complain with such a stellar cast?

Nearly every character is played by a seasoned veteran of British television, theater and cinema.  Hugh Grant plays a very convincing and understated Mr. Edward Ferrars.  His pregnant pauses and stuttered responses suggest a man so overwhelmed by society that he is afraid to utter anything at all.  Emma Thompson's Miss Elinor Dashwood, the tower of strength her family depends upon to keep the family circumstances afloat, is a total triumph.  The finale, where she finally comes unglued, is so in keeping with the tension with which the character has been dealing throughout the story.  Kate Winslet, while generally not my favorite actress, does a fantastic portrayal of Maryann Dshwood, the headstrong and emotional sister who plunges headlong into a romance and almost comes to disaster when her hero proves to be made of clay.  Even the youngest sister Margaret whose perky personality is put across despite her infrequent appearance on the screen, leaves one wondering what became of her and what she thought about these events later in life.  Someone should write her story.  Alan Rickman, at last in a romantic rather than a sinister role, is a wonderfully restrained suitor of Maryann.  He is a man of strong emotions kept bearly under control.  Harriet Walter, the heroine of the Lord Peter Whimsey mystery series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-Peter-Wimsey-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00009WNVN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord Peter Wimsey - The Complete Collection</a>, is here a wonderfully nasty sister-in-law of the Dashwood girls, and her response to the secret engagement of her older brother to her young protege, Lucy Steel, is a comedic masterpiece. Mrs. Jennings the inquisitive inlaw of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin Sir John Middleton, is played by Elizabeth Spriggs, an actress with whose creative talents I became familiar through her appearances on one of my favorite murder mystery programs, Midsommer Murders,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-14/dp/B0028AENSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 14</a>.  I've come to admire her talent for creating some truely memorable characters.  Her son-in-law, Sir John, played by Robert Hardy, is also familiar to me from this venue, as were some of the other minor characters.

As always, the scenery and costumes were fantastic.  Some of the indoor cinematography of people together in small groups reminded me of Vermeer paintings.  The intimacy of interiors lighted by candle light was splendid and gave the viewer a feeling of actually being part of the occasion; there was no sense that there were cameras running and bright lights illuminating a stage.  Even in the ambiance of the ball during the sisters' ""season"" in London there was  a sense of privacy and of a closed society known well only to one another.

170784,4,0800141660,"For being a motion picture and not a miniseries, this 1994 adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is quite good. It does eliminate many scenes, some characters, and alters certain minor elements of plot. However, Thompson does so in probably the most practical manner possible to maintain the overall integrity of the major story: Elinor and Marianne's romances. For people who claim the plot is boring, my only response is (1) that it isn't particularly Austen but (2) it is very interesting for individuals who have never read the novel, so much so that Thompson won an academy award for best screenplay.

One other point: some people might consider Thompson too old to play 19-20 year old Elinor Dashwood. From the cover of the DVD case, I'll allow you to make that decision for yourself.

Finally, if you are an Austen afficiando and you desire to know exactly where and how the film deviates from the novel, I have provided the following summary. If you have not read ""Sense and Sensiblity"" at least once in its entirety, what follows will not assist you. Also, what follows reveals certain plot details.

Changes:
Margaret is 11 years old rather than 13.
Colonel Brandon is named Colonel Christopher Brandon.
Lucy Steele has no sister.
Willoughby does not visit Marianne at the Palmers when she is ill.
Mrs. Ferrars (i.e. Edward's mother) is never physically shown in the film.

Below is a list of changes from the novel. One may assume that items not mentioned as having been changed accurately follow the novel.

Mrs. John Dashwood has no children.

Mrs. John Dashwood is not as manipulative of her husband as in the novel. She does not properly assist him in lowering and lowering what he plans to do for the Dashwood sisters. (In fact, Mrs. John Dashwood is portrayed as very selfish and rather stupid.)

Edward Ferrar's behavior is a little too romantic for the period. Also, Edward almost tells Elinor of his prior engagement to Lucy but then is called away by his mother to London.

Barton Cottage is a bit too large and fine, although this is not too obvious.

Sir John Middleton has no wife and children.

Mrs. Jennings does not ask Marianne to play a song after Marianne has just finished playing the same song.

Mrs. Jennings talks to Elinor about Brandon's past love life - details Brandon is supposed to provide at a later date.

Willoughby's behavior is also more modernized then it should be. At times, he behaves exceedingly childish and rude (more so than the novel would permit).

Lucy Steele does not arrive with her sister to Barton Park. In this film, Lucy has no sister.

Lucy does not confide her engagement secret to Elinor outside Barton Cottage but after a diner party at Barton Party.

Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings AND the Palmers, since in the film, they ALL travel to London at the same time.

Mrs. Jennings, Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne travel to London together. There is not evidence of Marianne being quiet/pensive on the trip because so little time is spent on the carriage ride from Barton Cottage to London. (This also mitigates, in the mind of the viewer, the very long distance between Barton Cottage and London.)

[Time between arriving at London and the ball where Marianne sees Willoughby is very minimal.]

The ball scene does not show Mrs. John Dashwood's treatment of favoritism toward Lucy at the expense of Elinor.

Miss Williams is given the first name of Beth.

Elinor tells Marianne about Willoughby's sexual escapades with Beth (i.e. Miss Williams) immediately after learning of them from Colonel Brandon, rather than waiting until the very end of the novel.

Lucy returns from the John Dashwood family (where she was a guest) to see Elinor. While Elinor and Lucy are talking, Edward arrives. Instead of Elinor going to fetch Marianne, Marianne, herself, enters. They are only together for a matter of moments before Edward claims he has to leave to perform an errand on Fanny's behalf. Lucy accompanies him.

Lucy, herself, tells Mrs. John Dashwood of her love for Edward Ferrars after Mrs. Dashwood claims Lucy is going to marry well.

Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he wishes to give the Dellaford living to Edward. However, this conversation takes place outdoors and is very short. Also, Mrs. Jennings is not present to misunderstand their conversation.

When the party goes to the Palmers country residence, Mrs. Jennings remains behind.

[Time between Willoughby's cruel letter and trip to the Palmers does not adequately show Marianne's decline in health.]

When Marianne wanders around outside the Palmers during a thunderstorm, she actually walks across fields, all the way to Willoughby's estate. While looking down upon the estate, she quotes Shakespeare's sonnet, ""Love is not love which alters...""

Marianne falls ill and is brought back to the Palmers by Colonel Brandon.

Mrs. Palmer is hysterical when Dr. Harris says that Marianne's fever is infectious and that she should remove her baby from the house.

Willoughby does NOT visit the Palmers during Marianne's illness to justify his behavior. He doesn't appear at all.

Immediately after Colonel Brandon arrives with Mrs. Dashwood to Marianne's bedside, the scene shifts back to Barton Cottage where Colonel Brandon is reading poetry to Marianne, who is still recovering her strength.

Colonel Brandon gives Marianne a small piano for Barton Cottage.

A double marriage occurs at the same time between Colonel Brandon and Marianne Dashwood & Edward Ferrars and Elinor Dashwood.

Scene with Willoughby looking down upon the cottage - seems to be with an air of regret.

Film ends with Colonel Brandon throwing handfuls of coins into the air for the villages (and others) who came to help celebrate his marriage to Marianne Dashwood.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

While I have pointed out basically everything that I completely diehard literalist might find uncharacteristic, this film is certainly NOT a bad one. While absolute literalists might prefer the Davies' adaptation of 2008, I certain recommend this adaptation as worthy or watching. Even Austen literalists should be able to appreciate this work, even though, like me, they might make of list (either literally or mentally) of all the changes.",1272758400,2,6252,5.006763285024155

170786,5,0800141660,"I love this movie and enough has been said about it that I will stick to my one beef/warning.

The Special Features have two audio commentary selections, one with Emma Thompson and one with Ang Lee the director and James Shamus the co-producer.

The commentary with Emma Thompson gives a lot of insight to the making of the film and the writing of the script, which is wonderful.

The commentary with Ang Lee and James Shamus is horrible!!! James Shamus talks over Ang Lee and one hardly gets to hear from the director himself. THREE TIMES in the first FIVE MINUTES of the commentary Ang Lee has to tell James Shamus that they are there to TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE because Shamus immediately goes into his political soapbox mode. Shamus ignores this and goes on to make such comments as ""There is something so creepy about a man who carries a knife and polishes a gun"", referring to the character of Col. Brandon. Then Shamus goes on about how this is a feminist movie, and that the Evil British Empire and Evil America were all about slaves and nothing else...sigh...

There is a time and place for politics, but I wanted to hear about the FILM and to hear it from the director, not the self-centered Shamus who continually interrupted Lee, continually brought the conversation back to his political views, and disallowed any real discussion of the film.

Ang Lee is a respected filmmaker. It would have been a treasure to hear from him, his insights, if it hadn't been for the enormous conceit of the co-producer. Why this is a ""special"" feature, I do not know.",1271548800,5,1559,4.613718411552346

My only beef is that Hugh Grant seems to play the same character in every movie, but he fits well in this one.

170790,5,0800141660,"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.

When those daughters are from Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. Ang Lee deftly adapted Ausen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" into the sort of movie it should be -- a lushly beautiful, quietly passionate period drama.

When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow  (Gemma Jones) and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.

Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor (Emma Thompson) begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward (Hugh Grant)... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne (Kate Winslet) soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby (Greg Wise).

But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...

I have to give Emma Thompson credit -- she not only turns in a brilliant, tightly-wound performance as Elinor (although she does look a bit old for the role), but she also wrote the faithful, solidly written script for Ang Lee's movie. The narrative glides silkily through the story, and adapts Austen's writing into elegantly vivid dialogue (""Can he love her? Can the soul really be satisfied with such... POLITE affections?"") with some moments of gentle humor (""How did you find the silver? Was it all genuine?"").

And Ang Lee takes what Thompson has wrought and makes it even lovelier, filling it with pale light, misty country hills, luxurious manorhouses, sunlit gardens and yards, and rain-swept fields where handsome men go riding on horseback. He has the knack for coaxing intense emotions from small gestures and words, and evoking budding love that is unsaid and unexpressed until the end (especially for Edward and Elinor). The absolute peak of his skill is right before Marianne's terrible illness, when she's left standing on a hilltop in the rain, whispering a Shakespearean sonnet.

Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. Thompson plays Elinor as being tightly wound and a bit repressed, while Winslet races joyously through the dramatic and romantic parts of the story, only for Marianne to crash and burn when Willoughby betrays her.

And the supporting cast is no less brilliant -- Jones and Rickman are particularly good as the girls' loving mother, and the mellow, quiet Colonel Brandon (the man ""everyone thinks well of, and nobody remembers to talk to"") who stands by hoping for Marianne's happiness. Wise, Robert Hardy, Elizabeth Spriggs and Harriet Walters all give excellent performances, and even Hugh Grant (who usually annoys me like an unreachable itch) did a good job as the shy, studious Edward.

""Sense and Sensibility"" is an emotionally powerful tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. And it was beautifully done by both of the people at its core -- Thompson's writing and acting, and Ang Lee's direction.",1262217600,3,3867,5.047021943573668

Emma Thompson did an incredible job in this film...without her expressive face, the film would have been significantly less.

She's an example of undying devotion to both her family and her friends, and the men show that they are aware of her selflessness.

170818,5,0800141660,"From the very first scene, it's obvious that the script has been expertly crafted. To condense a wonderful novel into a wonderful film can't be easy, and Emma Thompson did the best job of adapting an Austen novel into a film script that I've ever seen. Each scene is carefully written to tell the viewer exactly what she needs to know. For example, the opening scenes of Fanny and John make their relationship to each other and their eventual (mis)treatment of the Dashwood sisters painfully evident. And it doesn't hurt things that the cast is wonderful. Emma Thompson (though technically too old to be Elinor) is, as always, wonderfully expressive, and Alan Rickman does a great job of evoking sympathy and respect for Col. Brandon. The only weak spot I found was Hugh Grant. He seems extremely uncomfortable in 18th century clothes, and I found his mannerisms distracting. But other than that, this movie has mined much of the emotion as well as much of the humor from Austen's novel, and I highly recommend it.",1231804800,,1014,4.8

The story is believable and the characters are honest. You see the imperfections of the system as well as the optimism that kept them going. The sisters loose their father and are left with an emotional mother who is beside herself for the outcome of their situation and all that threatens her daughters - no dowry, no status, no husband to look after them, no future or hope.

170826,5,0800141660,"This is one of my favorite films. I must have watched it a dozen times, and own the DVD.

The script and production are exceptional. You will feel you are in Regency England, the sets, costumes, and landscape -- every detail of the production is gorgeous. The score is also wonderful, and Ang Lee's direction is, well, I'm running out of superlatives. Let's just say every scene is beautiful, and the direction, scoring, script, photography -- all are done beautifully to convey a sense of underlying silence, a quieter more thoughtful time than our own, with a gentler pace.

The casting is brilliant. Kate Winslet is the perfect Marianne Dashwood, and gives a marvelous performance. As does Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, and all the rest of the cast.

My only complaints are that Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant were miscast, and their acting was many notches below that of the rest of the cast.

Thompson, 36 at the time of this release, is far too old for the part of Elinor, 19. She is not believable as someone of marriagable age in that era. And Hugh Grant is miserably miscast as Edward. His youthfulness further accentuates Thompson's age.

They are not believable in the roles, and their performances are also not up to snuff. When they're on screen, I'm aware of acting and actors, not the characters and story. It's a glaring error, enough to be jarring each time I watch the film. This is a shame, because Thompson's amazing script, the casting, production, directing, and the rest of the cast make this film is a work of art in all other respects.

Even so, this film is a favorite and a wonderful treat each time I see it. I love it enough to give it 5 stars. It never gets old.",1226188800,,1693,4.570957095709571

Onto the movie itself.

Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson do a fantastic job of selling Elinor and Marianne.  It's a bit hard visually since Thompson looks so much older than Winslet, but they do the sisterly rather than the mother-daughter thing, so it works.  Winslet's hurt look when Willoughby won't shake her hand was the defining scene for me; with Elinor, it was the scene where she quietly drinks tea while the rest of the house is in an uproar over Willoughby's defection.

What else I liked.  Greg Wise and Alan Rickman as Willoughby and Brandon, respectively, are good as well.  Imelda Staunton as the cheery Charlotte Palmer and Hugh Laurie as her sarcastic husband are fun.  Laurie's few scenes are excellent - he comes across as sarcastic and displeased, but his genuine offer of help to Elinor when Marianne is sick is well done.  (But hey, it's Hugh Laurie.)

I liked how they use Margaret Dashwood to enhance Edward and Brandon; I enjoyed the non-Austen map scene as well as Brandon's teasing Margaret over her curious questions about the Indies.

Imogen Stubbs as Miss Lucy Steele was fantastic.  I'd seen this movie very early, before I read the book, and for awhile in the movie I couldn't figure out if she was supposed to be a good guy or a bad one.  Stubbs' sweet, earnest expression plays so well into Lucy's underhandness.

The other side characters were all right but not memorable.

What sucked: Edward Ferrars.  He didn't even show up and sent Hugh Grant in his place.  This was the worst Edward Ferrars I've ever seen; instead of Austen's Ferrars, this guy is basically a Regency version of every other character Hugh Grant's ever played.  He's kind of an inarticulate, kind of stammering, nervous, shy, bumbling but genuinely nice guy.  This is not Austen's Edward Ferrars.  I'll admit I missed it the first time I saw it - I had not yet read the novel - but upon second viewing it was pretty clear the disparity between Austen's and Thompson's versions.  It's a puzzlement as to why he's written this way; of course Thompson knows Austen better than this, and Grant has got more range than that usual bumbling thing.

A definite watch, though with a caveat emptor.",1218758400,2,2381,4.725728155339806

Sense and Sensibility is the first AR film I've purchased. It is glorious and beautiful and most likely the most perfect example of a Rickman movie, save for Harry Potter. The whole movie is wonderful and I've watched it several times already. Emma Thompson and Ang Lee did everything so perfectly that I cannot find fault with this movie. It is everything a romantic English drama should be and all of the actors were perfectly cast. Of course my favorite is Alan Rickman, but I loved the chemistry and dynamics between all of the principals. Hugh Grant is really sweet and gorgeous in this movie too and Emma Thompson is beyond reproach. Probably the best scene in this movie is at the end between Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, but I won't describe it just in case you have not yet seen this movie. It was awesome and it made me cry.  Kate Winslet was great too, although her character is kind of a pain in the neck. This film is what a great romantic story is all about, unlike Titanic in which I thought the script and the dialogue were ridiculous and dreadful and there was a total lack of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, which is too bad, because Winslet is a fabulous actor. Now for the question all us romantics have asked ourselves: Why would anyone choose Willoughby over Alan Rickman???  Here's another thought for all the Harry Potter fans.

Well, I'm announcing it formally right here and now: no more versions of Sense and Sensibility will be needed, because this one can't be exceeded.

This is a truly towering achievement by director Ang Lee and screenwriter/actor Emma Thompson.

The story is fabulous, the cast is superb, the settings and costumes are incredible, but here's the thing: this movie, with it's gorgeous lighting and photography, is simply the most visually beautiful film I've ever seen. You will be stunned when you see the sweeping expanses of the English countryside, the magnificent gardens and walled estates, all lit so carefully and exactingly. The HD version of this film may very well induce multiple screaming orgasms among cinephiles, it will be so spectacular.

A career-defining role for Hugh Grant, who has the self-effacing, sensitive and lovable fumbling schtick down perfectly. Emma is one incredible actress, certainly one of the greatest performers alive today. Alan Rickman is incapable of delivering an uninteresting take on anything he's in, and finally, the luminous Kate, the English Rose, with her flawless, dew-dropped peaches and cream complexion, is Sense personified.

Emma Thompson's screenplay is excellent. The character of Elinor properly displays the reticence of the Regency era, and Marianne embodies the new Romanticism that was beginning to emerge at that time. Their younger sister, Margaret, provided the much needed voice that stated the obvious when everyone else pretended it didn't exist. She really helped relieve the tension surrounding the social suppression of the times. The commentaries were excellent, too, and showed why it was so good for a man from Taiwan to have made a film about women in Regency England.

The storyline is candy-like, but has depth; the length of the film isn't burdensome (as Pride and Predudice - A&E version - might be), and it doesn't bore the viewer to watch it numerous times.

170872,5,0800141660,"I have watched this adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility more than a dozen times since it was released, and it never fails to enthrall me. It has everything one would expect of a classic movie - a good plot[ thanks in large part to Emma Thompson's excellent screenplay], stellar casting, gorgeous sets, costumes and lush scenery of the entrancing English countryside.

The story of Sense & Sensibility is at heart a warm and insightful portrait of two sisters and their relationship to each other, as well as their romantic interests and a powerful social commentary of society in regency England. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's works will appreciate how perceptive an observer she was of society at large and remarkable in her capability to capture powerful human emotions on paper.

The plot of Sense & Sensibility the movie revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor & Marianne, who upon the death of their beloved father are forced to move [together with their mother and younger sister] to a cottage in the English countryside and live on a paltry 500 pounds a year [due to English law at the time where property passes down through the male line]. Elinor [played excellently by the talented Emma Thompson] is the older, and more wise [sensible] sister, who tries not to let her emotions rule her, in direct contrast to her younger, feisty sister Marianne [a gorgeous English rose, Kate Winslet] who is passionate, outspoken and open in displaying her emotions.

Elinor falls for Edward Ferrars [an awkward yet deferential & handsome Hugh Grant] who due to a youthful indiscretion is unable to follow through on his attachment to Elinor. Marianne, on the other hand falls hard for dashing rogue Willoughby [Greg Wise], ignoring propriety and openly displaying her affections.

The rest of the story deals with how the Dashwood sisters resolve their plight, and the story is made even more compelling by the other characters, who may be deemed minor roles, certainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.

Taiwanese director Ang Lee [of Eat Drink, Man Woman & Wedding Banquet fame] certainly proves his mettle here and manages to flesh out amazing performances from his cast, and delivers a gem of a movie, and a true classic.",1193875200,,2582,5.065882352941176
170873,4,0800141660,"Jane Austen is regarded as England's first woman novelist. She concentrated on the manners and morals of the English upper classes, in particular on relationships between men and women. Her novels centered on romance and marriage.
This story tells of a man who had two marriages, of the division of his fortune and of the difficulties encountered by his daughters who are  left with little money by the rules of inheritance.
The women are taken in by a kindly relative. Each daughter falls in love, but the twists and turns of the relationships make for comedy and tragedy.

I think it captures much of the spirit of Austen's book, if not exactly faithful to her words.  I think the one thing the movie perhaps cannot convey or which falls a bit short is the Lucy Steele/Edward connection.  In the book, it is quite obvious that Lucy is only interested in Edward for his position and money.  Hugh Grant plays a charming, handsome, likable Edward whom Lucy might really have loved.  A large part of Elinor's story is missed by downplaying Lucy & her awareness of Elinor as a rival.  I missed that aspect.

I'd like to add that I think Jane Austen would have approved of the little bits and pieces that Emma Thompson added to the original story in writing the screenplay.

The characters are so entertaining, without becoming over-the-top.  My only complaint is that Lucy Steele was played a little too sweetly.

170884,5,0800141660,"The worst thing a person can do is underestimate Jane Austen.  Though it is true that her stories center on young women and their romantic struggles, her works are not mere romance novels.  This film does a wonderful job of demonstrating that.

Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress and she really brings Elinor to life.  At times she seems almost cold and unfeeling but she is actually a woman who keeps her own counsel and who is very aware of how society views young women.  Better to be thought a cold woman than to make a mockery of herself in the eyes of others.  Thompson is at her best in those brief moments when Elinor is alone, when she is gazing sadly at her sister while she plays pianoforte, when she is alone in her room and running her fingers over the monogram embroidered on a handkerchief.  Elinor is actually quite a complex character, a woman who loves deeply and wholly but who is also very self and socially aware.

Her polar opposite is her sister Marianne and Kate Winslet is simply perfect in the role.  She captures Marianne's youthful exuberance and the blissful lack of awareness that she has for what others think of her.  In this day and age, such individuality would be encouraged but in Marianne's time it is seen as a fatal flaw, one that risks making her the target of ridicule of others.  She follows her heart over her head, unlike Elinor.  As the title indicate, Marianne is all sensibility while her sister is all sense.

Hugh Grant does a nice job of portraying the somewhat socially awkward and very shy Edward.  He always looks uncomfortable in his skin and only seems to relax when he is with Elinor or when he is brushing up on his sword wielding skills with Margaret.  Edward exemplifies the plight of the younger sons of the era, the need to please the family in order to maintain his position.  This was not a time when going it alone was encouraged or even feasible.  It is Edward's sense of honor and duty that are almost his undoing and, in some ways, his situation is no better than that of the women.  Though he is ostensibly free to choose his profession, he is actually quite subject to the whims of his mother and his vicious social-climbing sister.

The most surprising and rewarding bits of casting lie with Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.  His world weariness and deep sadness are visible in every line of Rickman's face.  He has seen what society can do to a young woman determined to follow her passions as Marianne is and it has left a deep impression upon him.  Though Elinor has a good grasp of the world, Brandon understands it even better and one of the finest scenes of the movie is the one in which he chides Elinor not to wish for her sister to become acquainted with the ways of the world.

Emma Thompson did a fine job of writing the screenplay for this movie, cutting out some of the less essential bits and lifting quite a bit of the dialogue directly from the text.  Ang Lee's direction is lovely and his shots are framed with such care.  Often his cast doesn't even need to speak, they simply need to observe and Lee does a wonderful job of capturing the characters' emotions in their quieter moments.",1189036800,6,3175,4.49912739965096

If you love period films, then this is the movie for you. Like I said, I could never critique it properly because I could never find the right words to describe it.

Though people would consider it a 'chick flick', I have seen this with my fiance and he actually liked it as well. I cant stress enough how wonderful all the actors are.

170888,5,0800141660,"Sense and Sensibility is a relatively faithful adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.  Adapting novels to the big screen is always tricky but Emma Thompson did an excellent job of fitting the essentials into this film's 136 minutes.

The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility).  They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were.  I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending.

The casting is largely excellent.  Emma Thompson is too old to play Elinor but at least she plays her well.  Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Kate Winslet, and the entire cast all perform at a very high level.  I'm no fan of director Ang Lee, but he does a top notch job here of getting the best out of his actors and the screenplay and he succeeded in making a fine film.

This includes Kate Winslet as the ""Sensibility"" half of the sisters and Emma Thompson as the ""Sense.""  The story examines the plight of the Dashwood family, a unit of four woman who are displaced by their lack of inheritance and must find their way outside of the box that convention and social standing places around them as barriers.  Whoever thinks that Jane Austen films [or her novels, for that matter] are ""chick"" oriented needs to watch this film and they will have a different perspective.  For starters, Ang Lee's direction is beautiful, sensitive, and captures a wonderfully engaging quality to the whole story that is intriguing and lovely for PEOPLE to watch.

I have a preference for 19th century movies and books. This movie did not disappoint me. The actors and actresses all fit so perfectly into their roles. It was like magic to see them perform.

The Dashwood women, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret with along with their mother are forced to leave a life of luxury when Mr. Dashwood dies and they move into a cottage in the country. (Women have no rights to inherit when a man dies.) The money usually is given to the eldest sons in the family. The women must find another means to survive unless the one who inherits is generous enough to allow them to stay on. In this case, the greed of the son's wife overrules the son and the women are pressed upon to leave very quickly.

The oldest daughter develops a romantic interest in her half brother's wife's brother-in-law, but the sister-in-law makes certain that they are separated so that nothing more can develop.

The younger of the two oldest daughters abandons sensible conduct and rushes headlong into folly with a rake.

The two sisters are then taken into London for a season, and the truth is known about both men on their lives. One is already secretly engaged (entrapped is more like it)and the other has proposed to a wealthy woman because of his own bad debts.

Everything works out for the best and everyone gets what they deserve in the end. Life doesn't always look like it works that way, but it probably does. At least this movie inspires me to believe it.

With the exception of the male actor who played the Colonel, I found the female actresses to be more convincing in their portrayal of the female characters in Sense and Sensibility.

Performances are good, though the story has been so compressed that you will find yourself forced to pay strict attention.  I'll confess that I hadn't read ""Sense and Sensibility"" before seeing it, so I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who was who, and what was going on.  I don't think it's for the casual viewer.

Probably my biggest beef with this version is the editing:  I found it painfully hectic.  Cuts were quick, scenes were not permitted to linger, nuances were left undeveloped, and everything was in general lopped off to make way for the next thing.

Large sections of the production therefore have almost the feel of an MTV video, with many shots lasting about a second or less, leaving the viewer to wonder what is the wisdom of frogmarching us along so.

The answer is simple:  the filmmakers, intending this for wide release, knew they had a convoluted story to tell but had to bring it in in about 2 hours.

Since the mood and tempo of Austen's novel is completely at variance with what you see here (although consonant in other ways), I have no choice but to consider Lee's near-frenetic pace as an unfortunate and damaging decision.

It's a classic Jane Austen tale about love outside class boundaries and the inequities of women in 18th century England who can't inherit.

170911,5,0800141660,"Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.

Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and personal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.

Jane Austen wrote Sense and Sensibility in 1811, this being her first published novel. This film provides a rare combination of a superb interpretation of the author's novel and a cast that turns it into a masterpiece.

In the past, when a wealthy man died, for the most part, the male son would inherit his fortune. In Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen brings forth the terrible consequences of this costume, for Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, become impoverished after her husband dies. As it was expected, John inherites the estate, Norland.

John promises his father that he will take care of his sisters and step-mother, but being married to a rather selfish woman, she stops him from doing he horonable thing. So, the Dashwood women are now seen as strangers in their own home and soon set out to find alternative living quarters.

The older Dashwood, Elinor is rather taken by the selfish sister in law's brother, a gentle and intelligent young man, who is to marry a woman of high rank, so given that Elinor has sense, she does not hope to see her love aspirations come to fruition.

The Dashwood women move to Barton Cottage, where a distant cousin rents them affordable quarters. Marianne is the romantic sister, who upon spraining her ankle, meets a handsome young man who carries her to safety in the rain, and romance appears to strike. But the young man announces that he must return to London on business and the hopes of Marianne are shattered.

As Elinor Dashwood, Emma Thompson is powerful, funny as the Dashwood sister that possesses enough sense to enchant us all. Her sister, played by Kate Winslet, is a romantic who attracts several suitors, while Elinor deals with Hugh Grant, the person who ultimately brings this romance to a sheer delight.

The costumes are excellent. The setting of the manicured English countryside allows us to see the environment the author intended for the development of her wonderful characters.",1176681600,4,2824,5.032119914346895

170913,5,0800141660,"I am saying this because a new BBC Sense&Sensibility is being filmed right now and I must say, the actress who takes up the part of Marianne after Kate Winslet has a hard job ahead of her! I was really blown away by her performance and her portrayal of the passionate, idealistic and beautiful Marianne! She was so convincing in her role that Marianne has become one of my favourite heroines by Jane Austen after Elizabeth Bennet and Anne Elliot!

'to die for love, what could be more glorious than that?!' This is what Marianne says to her mother very early in the movie. And with this statement, Marianne already gives a glimpse of the passionate side of her character, how far she can go for love, to win the heart of the dashing Willoughby. But this statement also raises some important question about the meaning of true love? 'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Is it better to love like Marianne intensely, passionately and to be so blinded by it that you don't even see the flaws of the person that you love? Doesn't passionate love involve some pain sometimes? The film gives us some answers implicitly and it is up to you to see if the answer is to your liking.

Kate Winslet is surrounded by an impressive cast, Allan Rickman (what a man!!!, great performance and his intense looks towards Marianne!) as Colonel Brandon, Emma Thompson as Elinor, Greg Wise (I think) as Willoughby (the ultimate heartbreaker, he embodies the tall-dark-handsome womanizer to the perfection) and Hugh Grant (not spectacular but still worth it). Nothing bad to say about all these wonderful actors. They know their job. Plus, they are in a Ang Lee film...Ang Lee`s filming technique (Brokeback Mountain) is seen again throughout this adaptation, in the camera long shots of the actors, horse- riding or walking in the countryside, in the setting too..

I just have one more thing to add, E. Thompson's screenplay is brilliant, she has managed to give a sexy, very manly touch to the male characters. Sense &Sensibility is a wonderful adaptation that you can see again and again with still the same pleasure. Don't miss it if you haven't seen it yet.",1175904000,5,2135,4.718498659517426
170914,5,0800141660,"I have watched this adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility more than a dozen times since it was released, and it never fails to enthrall me. It has everything one would expect of a classic movie - a good plot[ thanks in large part to Emma Thompson's excellent screenplay], stellar casting, gorgeous sets, costumes and lush scenery of the entrancing English countryside.

The story of Sense & Sensibility is at heart a warm and insightful portrait of two sisters and their relationship to each other, as well as their romantic interests and a powerful social commentary of society in regency England. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's works will appreciate how perceptive an observer she was of society at large and remarkable in her capability to capture powerful human emotions on paper.

The plot of Sense & Sensibility the movie revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor & Marianne, who upon the death of their beloved father are forced to move [together with their mother and younger sister] to a cottage in the English countryside and live on a paltry 500 pounds a year [due to English law at the time where property passes down through the male line]. Elinor [played excellently by the talented Emma Thompson] is the older, and more wise [sensible] sister, who tries not to let her emotions rule her, in direct contrast to her younger, feisty sister Marianne [a gorgeous English rose, Kate Winslet] who is passionate, outspoken and open in displaying her emotions.

Elinor falls for Edward Ferrars [an awkward yet deferential & handsome Hugh Grant] who due to a youthful indiscretion is unable to follow through on his attachment to Elinor. Marianne, on the other hand falls hard for dashing rogue Willoughby [Greg Wise], ignoring propriety and openly displaying her affections.

The rest of the story deals with how the Dashwood sisters resolve their plight, and the story is made even more compelling by the other characters, who may be deemed minor roles, certainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.

Taiwanese director Ang Lee [of Eat Drink, Man Woman & Wedding Banquet fame] certainly proves his mettle here and manages to flesh out amazing performances from his cast, and delivers a gem of a movie, and a true classic.",1175644800,6,2582,5.065882352941176

Following the death of their father, the Dashwood sisters and their mother are thrown into financial straits, living in an austere country home and, without dowries, with poor prospects for contracting good marriages.  Emma Thompson plays oldest sister Elinor, the sensible one; a young Kate Winslet plays the romantic and impulsive middle sister Marianne. They will offer contrasting styles in courtship.  Elinor waits out the obstacles to a promising relationship with a weathly suitor (played appealingly by Hugh Grant) with almost heroic patience, while younger sister Marianne falls for a rogue, ignoring the interest of an older but caring suitor played with admirable restraint by Alan Rickman.

170925,4,0800141660,"In her commentary track, Emma Thompson accurately notes the difference in style between Jane Austen's early  novel Sense and Sensibility (two version A and B so it it is a bit hard to date) and later novels such as Emma. She calls the style of  Sense and Sensibility -- I think- ""prolix"" and in fact it is a much more difficult novel to read than Pride and Predjudice Emma or Persuasion (though not perhaps Mansfield Park). I would rather call the style ""dense"" that is it makes you work to discover its pleasures. I don't know that this density can be reproduced in a film--though it might have a chance in a well conceived mini series (Lonesome  Dove comes to mind). Sense and Sensibility is a disturbing novel--one that resists easy and perhaps any definitive interpretation. What causes its pleasurable vexations is the language (not its ""message"") and as  Thompson notes, only a few lines from the novel were used in the film. Consequently we are presented with a romance--beautifully conceived and superbly acted--a romance well directed and well written (hats off to Emma Thompson) but it is really not Jane Austen and doesn't give us a sense of what it is like to read  Sense and Sensibility. I think Emma Thompson might agree.

I have dwelt on the movie's compromises--but given the  time limits of a theatrical release I think this is the best you can do. This is a lovely film with its own integrity.  While it does not prepare a viewer for the novel, it is a graceful achievement in its own right. It has its own intelligence and craft and is well worth seeing. Just keep in mind that the driving intelligences behind this film belong to Ang Lee and Emma Thompson (and the splendid cast) Jane Austen's vision (and I still don't know quite how to describe that after many readings) is only remotely present. This probably sounds like an indirect slap at the movie; it is not. This is a film to watch with care and delight.",1171584000,3,1933,4.615160349854228
170926,2,0800141660,"Yes, this is a very lame production. Maybe I'm in a minority of one, but I find Emma Thompson to be an atrocious actress, in the same way as, for example, Katherine Hepburn, of an earlier generation. They just can't shed their real-life selves. So, in this movie, we have Ms Thompson pretending to be a Jane Austen heroine, and the pretense is there for all to see, all the time. She does not persuade me for one fleeting second that she is Elinor Dashwood. By way of contrast, I'll mention a couple of names that spring to mind who almost invariably convince, in whatever role -- Paul Giamatti and Billy Bob Thornton. They manage to suppress their personalities in such a way as to inhabit the character to just such a degree that he becomes credible. Ms Thompson is, sad to say, ever and always herself. It's not for nothing that the writer Frank Harris called acting a ""half-art"" -- the reason being that, in his view, anyone with a strong personality can't lose himself enough. Ms Thompson is prey to precisely this self-consciousness. Irene Richard, no beauty herself, wears the role of Elinor like a glove in the 1985 BBC production, a most subtle and self-effacing portrayal by an under-rated actress.

Enough about Thompson. Hugh Grant is wooden, quite an achievement by Ang Lee with an actor usually known for his suave manner. Kate Winslet is a very limp romantic, and can't compare to the glowing Tracey Childs in the 1985 BBC production.

It's true that the pictures are prettier in the movie version. And that the youngest Dashwood sister is awol for the BBC. Big deal. Go for the BBC production.",1171238400,12,1609,4.661971830985915

170940,5,0800141660,"I know that Austen purists pick at Emma Thompson's real age v. her character's age, but not being an Austen fan, I found no issue with the age of anyone in the film.  And, since Emma Thompson spent five years working on this script, she deserved the chance to play Elinor, which she does splendidly (and, as Whoopi Goldberg said ""that's why they call it acting."")

I'm not an Austen fan, and never read any of her books until after I saw Emma Thompson's and Ang Lee's beautiful telling of this story.  I read the book and found it flat compared to the brilliant script and direction in the film.  Reading the novel after seeing the film, I felt like I was trying to read a dream: you see something, but you can't really focus on it.

However, Emma Thompson keeps the most important characters and story lines, and Ang Lee's direction keeps the film moving.  Caution: it does seem to start slowly as the film sets up the plot of the young women being disinherited and their greedy sister-in-law preventing their elder brother from endowing them with the funds needed for their station.

Watch for Hugh Laurie's incredibly pained (and outstanding)performance as a serious, quiet man married to a silly woman who never stops talking.  He uses a newspaper as a shield against his wife and mother-in-law's slings and arrows.  Now being a ""House"" television series fan, when I re-watch this film, I wish he could let loose on his wife like he does as House!

Even if you don't like Austen novels, you will like this film if you are a fan of films of the 1930s and 1940s.  Why?  Because it is driven by the script and not special effects.  It's about people, and the painful daily choices we must make knowing that love does not always conquer all.

170941,5,0800141660,"The enormously talented Emma Thompson wrote the marvelous screenplay for this brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.

The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.

This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way. All comes out right in the end, however, but it is the getting there that makes this film a must see.

A witty, funny, and romantic film, it boasts a first class ensemble cast. While Ms. Thompson may be a bit long in the tooth for the role which she plays, her thespian talents and charm enable her to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat.

It was ok though.  I'm glad I didn't watch it with my husband though otherwise I would have heard an endless river of yawns & sighs & mumbles of when the movie would end.

Was this Emma Thompson's first screenplay????  It was pretty good in that sense.  She looked great in this movie but a bit old when compared to Hugh Grant.  That's ok though because I would have preferred her acting over any other average 17 through 20 year-old mediocre one.

Her character was wonderful at keeping all her wits together (minus the 5 second breakdown @ the happy end of the movie, of course).  Kate Winslet was wonderful too.  Her character was a bit too quirky & dreamy for my taste but that just displays her master of the art of acting too.  MAN!  I thought I was a hopeless romantic (modern-day) but her character was just over-the-top!  I'm rather glad she ended up w/the Col. Brandon versus the equally hopeless-romantic Willoughby.  Was it mean of me to be happy that Willoughby left?  No - I thought he was too fake anyway although Marianne fell for it.  Funny, I couldn't help seeing The Sherriff of Nottinghame & worse yet Proffessor Snape when watching Alan Rickman though.  Wonderful actor but it doesn't hurt to see handsome folks on screen (of which I personally don't think Rickman is - to each their own though) but I think that made it even more believable, right?

Thank goodness for my new obsession for period pieces and film adaptations, for I might have never feasted my eyes upon such a lovely piece of work.  Emma Thompson wrote the adaptation and she did a fine job in bringing Austen's romanticism, humor and social commentary to life.  Everyone who has read the book knows this centers on the two elder Dashwood sisters -- Elinor and Marianne -- and their loss of money and good connections when their father dies and their estates are passed on to the male heir, a son from a previous marriage.  He promised his father to provide for his sisters, but is manipulated into not doing so by his conniving wife (played by Harriet Walter).  Penniless and without dowries, the girls' chances of making a good marriage become nil.  However, they are not lacking in suitors.  Elinor (Emma Thompson), the elder sister and sensible one, falls for the dashing Mr. Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant).  Even though the affections are reciprocated, Edward is otherwise obliged to another.  Marianne (Kate Winslet) is the silly, romantic type -- always reading poems and sonnets and romanticizing a dashing hero that would sweep her off her feet.  In comes the charming Mr. John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who is the embodiment of everything Marianne desires...or is he?  Then there is Col. Christopher Brandon (Alan Rickman), a kind gentleman who would do anything for Marianne.  Will the Dashwood sisters find love in spite of their less than acceptable conditions?

This film is a marvel.  The quality of the production is top notch.  The wardrobe brings the Georgian/Regency period to life and the scenery is gorgeous.  Every aspect of this film is awesome.  Hollywood has created some rather superficial film adaptations, but this is one of the exceptions.  Bravo for Emma Thompson for her excellent work in both writing the script and for her wonderful acting.  I agree with the reviewers who thought Thompson was too old to play a nineteen-year-old, but few actresses, regardless of age, would've portrayed Elinor with as much depth and range.  The acting in general is commendable.  I had my doubts about Hugh Grant playing Mr. Ferrars, but he handles the portrayal rather well.  The handsome Greg Wise (whom I'd seen in BBC's The Buccaneers) plays the deceivingly charming Mr. Willoughby flawlessly.  Mr. Willoughby has always reminded me of Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Wickham, but Wise was able to give the character his own voice.  Kate Winslet is my favorite in this movie as Marianne.  She portrays Marianne's youth, innocence and, at times, tactlessness with aplomb.  Alan Rickman, Gemma Jones (Mrs. Dashwood) and Imogen Stubbs (Miss Lucy Steele) are also great.  I cannot say enough good things about this film except that it is a must-have for your DVD collection, especially if you're a Jane Austen fan and lover of film adaptations and period pieces like I am.

The lively interplay of Thompson's emphatic Elinor and the youthful Marianne played by Winslet lies central to the success of the film. A succeeding formula crowns the work under the immaculate direction of Ang Lee, the maestro of picture-perfect mis-en-scene with a lush, sublime and stirring score by Patrick Doyle.

Like one of the reviewers, I was inducted into this film at a ""wrong"" age and found it to be a bore. Years later, a foray into ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Keira Knightley kindered my interest in Jane Austen works adapted for film and eased me into the joys of this marvellous film.

I dismissed this film as one of those movies I'll never like, but then last year I was delighted when watching `Pride and Prejudice' and it hit me...I'm not ten anymore and I just might like these kinds of movies now.  So, I decided to give `Sense and Sensibility' a try and I was quickly set at ease for I became completely absorbed in this film.

The film focuses on the Dashwood family, more notably the two eldest sisters Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet).  We see their struggles to find true love and keep it and we're endeared towards them as their attempts at happiness are met with the harshest of resentment and persecution.  That's not to say that this isn't a happy and warm film, it's just sad to see what they must fight against, most notably their evil sister-in-law Fanny (Harriet Walter).  As Elinor struggles to provide for her family emotionally she shelters her own emotions and refuses to confide in anyone whereas Marianne is open in her emotions, very charismatic and almost selfish in her manner.

To me the acting is what really drives this movie home.  Both the leading women are great, but it's Kate who lifts this movie (and pretty much every movie she does) and causes it to soar above the rest.  Her Marianne is not only convincing but memorable.  In my humble opinion she deserved the Oscar.  Alan Rickman is also very good here as the gentleman Colonel Brandon who wants only the best for Marianne, and Greg Wise is every bit charming as he is despicable as Willoughby.  Now I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, at least not a huge fan.  I much prefer his selfish play boy types like in `Two-Weeks Notice' and `About a Boy', so here I felt he was a bit miscast.

170953,5,0800141660,"The enormously talented Emma Thompson wrote the marvelous screenplay for this brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.

The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.

This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way.

170954,5,0800141660,"This film looks beautiful with that particular fresh and green loveliness that typifies the gentlefolk's 18th / 19th century England. It's a delight to watch, and the screenplay itself is wonderfully done, combining the sensible and likeable characters with the truly absurd characters, not to mention those whose characters are morally enfeebled. Jane Austen's depiction of human frailty as well as goodness has always impressed me as being true and very apt, striking home not merely with insightful viewing of human beings but also the very particular aspects that define a person of English gentility in the 1800s.

Emma Thompson has certainly done a splendid job with the screenplay. Unlike the recent unfortunate adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", this adaptation includes virtually all of the essential story threads, and gives appropriate screentime to all the characters. One becomes thoroughly engrossed not only in the travails of the two Dashwood sisters, but also all of those they encounter.

Kate Winslet is simply perfect as Marianne Dashwood, the sister with all the sensibility. She embodies every aspect of the character - her winsomeness, her charm, her gaiety, the immoderate way in which she throws herself into life, and her lack of prudence. In appearance and behaviour, no better Marianne could have been found.

Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, the somewhat shy but intelligent gentleman of excellent morals and strong feelings, whose qualities Marianne learns to appreciate after the tumultuous miseries of her relationship with Willoughby, is excellent - which is no surprise. Is there a role in the world that Alan Rickman cannot play, and play more convincingly than anyone else?

Greg Wise as the unreliable Willoughby, whose dashing good looks and romantic persona gain Marianne's love but who ultimately proves to be a man of straw whose self-interest will always lead him to disappoint the hopes of others in pursuit of his own gain, is wonderfully cast.

The scheming Lucy Steele is played with extraordinary deftness by the excellent Imogen Stubbs, who portrays not only the machinating and self-serving aspects, but also the encroaching sweetness that deceives so many.

Every part, in fact, with the exception of two, is superbly cast.

I do consider the film has two flaws - the casting of Emma Thompson as Elinor, and far worse, the casting of Hugh Grant as Edward. Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress, but I find it impossible to think of her as Elinor, both on account of her being visibly too much older than the nineteen of Miss Dashwood in the novel, and also in her portrayal somehow seeming rather too ruefully pragmatic. I suppose I have always envisaged Elinor as being a different type - sensible, calm, yes, but not visibly self-dampening, and of course younger. Hugh Grant as Edward seems to me to have been the film's only major mistake. One does not sense from the novel that Edward is supposed to be a completely inarticulate gentleman, stiff-necked, addicted to such high cravats that he appears to be choking, and with scarcely any qualities that would lead one to suppose him the type likely to attract Elinor. I have always thought of him more as a calm and sensible young man with deep feeling, whose reluctance to communicate with Elinor after he realised he was falling in love with her was due ONLY to his knowledge of his existing entanglement with Miss Steele - not to a reticence and inarticulation that are embedded in his character.

I overcame my qualms with regard to the casting of Elinor - after all, Emma Thompson is never less than charming, and she is a wonderful actress indeed. But Hugh Grant as Edward strikes me EVERY time I watch this DVD as... simply wrong.

Yet in spite of these things, the film works beautifully in almost every way for me. I'd prefer to give the film 4 and a half stars rather than five, but without that option, let it be five.

Several other critics have found fault with Emma Thompson's age, stating that she was too old for the part; allow me to comment on this:

Thompson is not the only actor who is accused of being too old to play one of Austen's heroines. To me, it often seems to be the other way around: Elinor is surprisingly young for such a sensible young woman.

We don't have to look very far for the reason, however: Compared to us people had very shortened life spans in the ages before the invention of modern medicine. Just think of Mrs. Bennet (in Pride & Prejudice) who is permanently afraid of her husband's death of old age, although he is in his late forties or early fifties at most.

As people's lives were shorter and their world much smaller than ours it is not to be wondered at that characters in Austen's novels who are some twenty years old, appear surprisingly adult to us.

One way to compensate for this is to cast actors who are quite a bit older. If not, trouble often results; just look at Keira Knightley who *is* in the right age bracket and decidedly too immature to play Elizabeth Bennet (Pride & Prejudice again).

Emma Thompson on the other hand is completely convincing as Elinor.",1153440000,8,1289,4.440677966101695

And yet, while I do think it's a good movie, it's not my favorite S&S, for reasons I will go into in this review. I have several problems with it, including much of the casting and some of the writing as well. Really my feelings towards this and P&P95 are quite similar, but at least this movie doesn't have any of the ""sexed up"" content Andrew Davies put in P&P. Why do I have so many problems with both of these versions? Is it just because I think they're overrated and I have a tendency to root for the underdog blindly? Well, no. But that is admittedly a small part of it. Rather, I already found flaws in each adaptation but these were magnified after constantly hearing people say how ""perfect"" they are. I'm really not trying to offend any fans of this movie. I AM a fan of this movie, own it on DVD, and have watched it multiple times. I just think it's not as good as many fans seem to think it is. And any time I hear ""definitive"" about any adaptation (even my absolute favorites), it drives me up the wall!

The casting is my biggest problem with this movie. Most of the actors are frankly, way too old for their roles. Okay, maybe if EVERY character were aged up it would make sense. But they're not and that just adds to the problem. Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman are all MUCH older than their characters, yet Kate Winslet is nearly the same age as the book's Marianne.",1152057600,,1517,4.304195804195804

My only real complaint about the production is that, while Emma Thompson played an excellent Elinor, she was at least 10 years too old for the part.  There were times when her Elinor and Margaret looked more like mother and daughter than two sisters.

However, I think that the rest of the casting was spot-on.  Elizabeth Spriggs and Robert Hardy as Mrs. Jennings and Sir Middleton made an excellent team and Imogen Stubbs captured Lucy perfectly.  I think that Emilie Francois as Margaret was particularly well cast; it can be difficult to find good child actors, and she was very believable and not a bit precocious.

So goes a scene from ""Sense and Sensibility"", Emma Thompson and Ang Lee's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic.  The story, which takes place early 1800's England, focuses on the Dashwood sisters, Marianne, about 16 years old, and her older sister Eleanor, played by Emma Thompson.

After their father dies, the Dashwood family, including the mother and the three sisters lose their fortune and begin to embark upon a more modest life, being forced to move from their estate to a relative's ""snug"" cottage.

The film, in essence, follows Eleanor and Marianne as they are thrown into love with their likely and unlikely suitors,  the humble and slightly bumbling, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and the tormented yet dependable Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Another key element is the loving bond between the two sisters.

From the sweeping and lush English countryside to the historic streets of London, we see the two young women experience infatuation, passion, heartbreak, patience, wisdom, and finally, love.  Emma Thompson's screenplay is both funny and touching, sometimes pointing out how the times were hard for women.  She does not follow the book religiously but does an amazing job in capturing the essence of the Dashwood girls and their struggle to live a full life amidst their limitations of both class and sex.

The sets and the exterior scenery are beautiful, the acting amazing throughout the entire cast (including a younger yet still brooding Hugh Laurie).

170963,5,0800141660,"If you are as big a fan of period films as I am, this is a must-have for your DVD collection.  Set against the backdrop of the lovely English countryside, this story has all the elements that make for fine costume drama: love, romance, betrayal, unrequited affection, and a bit of comedy.  Emma Thompson, who plays Elinor Dashwood, is the heroine of the film.  Kate Winslet plays her younger sister, Marianne Dashwood.  The youngest of the Dashwood sisters, 12-year old, Margaret, played by Emily Franciose, is both adorable and colorful. She brings comedy and a refreshing innocence to the film as does other eccentric characters like Mrs. Jennings and Sir John.

The story begins with the death of their father, who, due to the legalities of the time, was not able to bequeath his estate to his daughters.  Consequently, the Dashwood girls and their mother are left penniless and must depend on the generosity of the legal heir to the fortune, John Dashwood, son from the father's previous marriage. The father makes John promise to provide for his step-mother and sisters, and John agrees. John's wife, Fanny, is introduced in the following scene, and the audience immediately discovers Fanny's comfortable ability to manipulate her husband and control every situation to her advantage.  She is self-serving, greedy and conniving throughout the film, and she has John wrapped completely around her finger.  She weaves a web of contrived, non-sensical explanations as to why John can not and should not keep his promise to his father to provide for his sisters and stepmother; John acquiesces; hence, the Dashwood girls are left with no means of support and no dowries. Alas, herein lies their dilemma as suitors will be reluctant to offer proposals of marriage to women in such dire straits. This fact becomes painfully evident when Marrianne falls deeply for the gallantly handsome, Willoughby, who by all accounts is a cad of the first order, albeit unbeknownst to Marianne. Set to inherit his aunt's vast estate, Willoughby is disinherited once his benefactress discovers his wanton ways. He must then choose whether to ""rank the demands of his heart above that of his pocketbook"".  He's, therefore, confronted with the decision to marry the impoverished Marianne or propose to the wealthy heiress, Miss Grey.  He opts for the latter but not before breaking Marianne's heart and leaving her with no explanation for his abrupt break with her.

Marianne for much of the film pines away over Willoughby, (she really is quite pathetic), while the level-headed and longsuffering Elinor spends her time comforting her and pointing out to Marianne Willoughby's improprieties and the non-reality of one's happiness being totally dependent on one person. Elinor is ever so noble; she provides constant emotional support to Marianne and works assiduously to make ends meet for the family while accepting the possibility that her hope of uniting with the man she loves,the honorable Edward Ferrars, played by Hugh Grant, may never be realized.

It is intriguing to watch how the contrasts between Elinor and Marianne interweave to form a delicate tapestry that brings balance to their existence or co-existence, as it were.  Marianne spends 90% of the movie prating about love, Shakespearean sonnets, and flowery affection, while the more reserved Elinor looks at life through the lens of practicality, always espousing the virtues of honor and duty.  Nevertheless, they are both very likable characters, and the viewer roots for them in their quests for love.  The costumes are completely authentic and the cinematography breathtaking.  It was beautifully and artfully shot, so if you like visually stunning period pictures with realistic plot lines and stellar performers, you won't find a better one than Sense and Sensibility.",1147996800,3,3825,5.185064935064935

I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.

Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it.

It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic.

One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place. The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too.

This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection.

170969,5,0800141660,"What a wonderful movie this is! I just finished reading Austen's original, so when I finished the book I dug out my old video copy to see how close it was to the book. It was amazing! There are a few differences which did not detract from the movie in any way. Lucy Steele's older spinster sister was eliminated--her only use in the book was to spill the beans about the secret engagement to the evil Fanny, and Emma Thompson's version merely has Lucy whisper the news to Fanny. Mrs. Dashwood's cousin John, who invites them to live in the cottage in Devon, is a widower in the movie, his wife and children gone as characters. They did not add that much to the book--the wife spoils the children and doesn't have any self-identity besides that of mother. (Sounds an awful lot like some so-called stay-at-home moms today!)

Finally, the character of Margaret, the youngest sister, has been beefed up considerably. In the book, Margaret has no personality, no role besides someone to keep the mother in the country while the older sisters are in London. In the movie, Margaret's many interests and quirks (the world atlas, the treehouses, the insistence on speaking her mind, her rousing energetic banter with Edward) make her a fully formed, interesting character who adds tremendously to our understanding of why Elinor thinks Edward such a terrific person.

It would be great if Jane Austen could write a sequel to Emma Thompson's screenplay, telling whatever became of Margaret!",1143849600,3,1480,4.845849802371541

170971,5,0800141660,"Ang Lee directed, and Emma Thompson wrote and starred in, this wonderfully romantic adaptation of the Jane Austin novel, full of exquisite locations and costumes, as well as superb performances. In the Empire period of England, Mrs. Dashwood (played by Gemma Jones) and her three daughters - Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois) - are left all but destitute upon the death of her wealthy husband, his having bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his son from a previous marriage. Because of the generosity of relatives, the Dashwoods are set up in a cottage in the country, where they meet three gentlemen: two young suitors with financial difficulties - Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) and John Willoughby (Greg Wise) - and a third, middle aged widower, Colonel Brandon (played by Alan Rickman), who owns the largest estate in the county.

Thompson shines as Elinor, the sister with the most practicality (sense), and Winslet is perfect as Marianne, the sister with the most passion (sensibility). Their hearts and fortunes are up in the air, as Elinor withholds her feelings from Grant's fumbling and elusive Edward, whom she thinks is engaged to someone else; and Marianne throws her heart carelessly at the feet of Wise's dashing but inconstant Willoughby. Rickman's stable and less interesting Colonel Brandon bides his time, as he waits to see how circumstances will play out, meanwhile doing his best to be a good friend to the family. Emotions run high, and disappointments deep, but the payoff is pure jubilation. The ending is one of the most emotionally explosive I've ever experienced. If you love to cry, get ready.

Among the delights of this film is the supporting cast. Imelda Staunton as the busybody Charlotte Palmer and Hugh Laurie as her stolid yet subtly sarcastic husband are classic. Other performances were equally fun. This film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, which it won for Thompson's script. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is one of the great romantic masterpieces of all time.

I found ""Sense and Sensibilty"" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since ""Pride and Prejudice"". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first.  I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.

The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly, if you don't, you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It's very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors: Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant.

Jane Austen is a frightfully difficult mountain to tackle for even the most experienced of screewriters, and Thompson conquers this feat with the adroitness of an learned professional. (Her Academy Award shows others thought so too)

Emma Thompson plays Elinor Dashwood, a practical-minded young lady who spends most of her energy looking after her two sisters and mother, which unfortunately gets in the way of her marrying. Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood, a passionate lively young woman who isn't afraid of showing her love to anyone. Alan Rickman also delights as the staid Colonel Brandon (oh my god, his voice...) and Hugh Grant is appropriately 'English' as the bumbling Mr. Ferrars with whom Elinor falls in love.

Particularly dazzingly performances from Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, though their youngest sister, little Margaret, also gives a memorable performance as a spunky, geography-minded girl.

170982,5,0800141660,"Sense and Sensibility is the best feature film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  It is a typical Jane Austen plot.  Young women with no means looking for a good match.  The Dashwood sisters' father has passed away and they have lost their means of support.  The cousin who inherited the land has put them on a meager allowance and forced them to move to a small cottage with their mother (Gemma Jones).

Elinor (Emma Thompson) meets Edward Ferras (Hugh Grant) and she falls for him.  The problem is she finds that he is promised to another (Imogene Stubbs).

While visiting neighbors, Marianne (Kate Winslet) meets the stoic Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  He falls in love at first sight with Marianne but the she meets the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and immediately falls for him.  Unfortunately, Elinor finds out that Willoughby has the reputation of toying with women.

In the end true love wins out.  Elinor & Edward and Marianne and Brandon marry.

This is a brilliant adaptation in every sense (& sensibility).  Ang Lee had success with a couple of Chinese films and proved that he could adapt into the English language film market.  In interviews he gave a lot of credit to Emma, stating that she worried how the lines were being said and he concentrated on the visual aspect of the film.  This made a perfect combination.

Emma wanted better roles and decided to adapt the book.  You can tell by her use of language that she loved the book and Austen's writing.  She deserved her Oscar for the screenplay.  She also deserved her Best Actress nomination.  She has shown in her two Ivory Merchant films (Howard's End and Remains of the Day), plus this, that she is the perfect period romance actress.

Kate Winslet had a success in an Australian film but this was the film that brought her to the attention of the mass market.  Alan Rickman was best known for playing villains so this was an unexpected surprise.  He showed that he has a truly romantic side.  The Hugh Grant stereotype, the befuddled gentleman, was created in this film.

The production values from sets and costumes to music and cinematography are all first rate.

170983,5,0800141660,"This stands in my mind the most well-done movie adaptation of certainly any Jane Austen novel, but also any book I have personally ever seen.  In a time where all entertainment has to be filtered through our modern lenses, and stories tampered with and mistreated because of a directors political views, it is amazing to have a movie which so transperantly reveals the intentions of the author.  And yet it is in no way made prudish for staying so close to the book, probably because the book isn't prudish either, only to some modern readers it appears so next to our rather lax forms of novel-writing.  Jane Austen was wonderful at being honest, straight-forward, and sensible in all of her books, not gushing all over the page like a jelly donut.  The story is shown equal respect in this movie, Emma Thompson in particular delivering a very impressive depiction of Eleanor, the only member of her family with any kind of sense, who is considered to be the less passionate of her sisters because she does not display her feelings with as little reserve and discretion as her younger sister does.

  The cinematography, the casting, the screen-play and soundtrack are all exemplary, and this is in short, the best of movies.",1136851200,,1226,4.781990521327014

170987,5,0800141660,"I remember first seeing the film in the cinema and also very well remember the total enchantment I felt. The production has captivated me right from the start and still does whenever I watch it over and over again.

The chemistry between the Dashwood sisters played by Emma Thompson (sensible, rational and seemingly restraint Elinor) and Kate Winslet (passionate, oversensitive and open Marianne)works wonderfully. The family picture completed with Gemma Jones as Mrs Dashwood and Emily F. as Margaret is lovely and lively. There are some fresh family scenes where Margaret gets more attention (she is not wholly portraited in the book as a rather insignificant character)giving light touches to the film preventing it to become too gloomy at certain points.

Emma Thompson created an absolutely wonderful screenplay. Sad and funny events alternate each other increasing and relaxing tension making the film intriguing and exciting from first minute to the last.

A pity that two scenes were deleted where Elinor's character - a dialogue between her and her mother - gets highlighted even further and a pity for the deleted kiss with Hugh Grant. Fortunately they can be enjoyed as extras on the DVD.

As to male performance, I found Alan Rickman's colonel Brandon - the character is actually a bit flat in the book, not too much excitement there - totally stunning. He gave dimension to the character: he was humane, gentle and good, but very manly without a trace of boredom in him. You could feel his passion for Marianne and the past sadness still lingering over him. The scene where he gets introduced in the film (his intently watching Marianne as if spellbound) is one of the most amazing peaks of the film.

Hugh Grant was a shy, but likeable Edward Ferrars, his caring, brotherly relationship with Margaret made him more endearing. Greg Wise played a truly dashing Willoughby.

The Devon scenery - wonderful, wonderful Britain! - was photgraphed at its most advantageous, the costumes were brilliant and the sonnets gave true dramatization to plot and characters.

The characters are very believable and as I mentioned je ne sais quoi, is the only phrase to describe the players--they added an indescribable something to the roles. Perhaps the only character that almost fell out of good graces with me was Colonel Brandon.

However, as it stands, Emma Thompson deserved her distinction as being not only a gifted actor but also an award winning screenwriter. I wish there were more people in Hollywood like her! Ang Lee is probably one of the most talented directors today. He reminds me of Stanley Kubrick in the fact that he likes to tackle different genres of film. Lee went from a contemporary Asian family-drama (Eat Drink Man Woman) to a Jane Austen period piece (Sense & Sensibility) and pulled it off. It is a shame that he does not have one Academy Award for his directorial efforts because he is more talented than some winning directors are. The acting is wonderful, with Kate Winslet really giving a passionate performance. Emma Thompson played Elinor well (despite the age of the character being much younger).

I saw this movie again on March 12 and...ah, what the hell, read on.

Emma Thompson (""Dead Again,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"") is the screenwriter and star of this excellent adaptation of one of Jane Austen's most beloved works (the others being ""Mansfield Park,"" ""Emma"" and ""Pride And Prejudice""). Recently divorced from Kenneth Branagh, who cast her in his adaptations of William Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (which he directed, produced, wrote for the screen and starred in; see my review on ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and other Shakespearean adaptations) and ""Dead Again"" (he only directed and starred in that one), Ms. Thompson agreed to tackle this project as ""Jane Austen is my favorite author"" when approached by producer Lindsay Doran on the set of ""Dead Again"" and does an excellent job with the material, such a good job that she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay (competing against Randall Wallace for Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" [which won Gibson Best Picture and Best Director]) AND WON!! Well deserved, too. Kate Winslet (pre-""Titanic"" fame and whose next role would be as Ophelia opposite Kenneth Brangah in the latter's uncut, star-studded 4-hour version of ""Hamlet"" [see my review on that one and the 1948 version of ""Hamlet"" starring, produced, text-edited, though he went uncredited, and directed by Sir Laurence Olivier aka The Master Of The Bard and arguably one of the greatest Shakespearean actors who ever lived] as well as prior and watch for upcoming reviews on faithful other versions of William Shakespeare's plays), Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman (fresh off his role as the villainous Sherrif Of Nottingham in Kevin Reynolds' remake [to a certain extent] of the 1938 classic ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" [see my review on it] starring screen legends Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland [whose next project was the equally successful 1939 classic ""Gone With The Wind"", see my review of the VHS], based on the classic novel of the same name by Margaret Mitchell) play the two potential suitors in this wonderful version, Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon, respectively. Greg Wise plays the villainous Willoughby. Imelda Staunton (who two years prior had been cast as Margaret in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and recently won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in the drama ""Vera Drake"") plays Charlotte Palmer. The rest of the cast does a great job in this well-scripted/well-casted film. Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") does a fine job directing this period piece. Ms. Thompson should have also brought ""Pride And Prejudice"" to the screen as well (there's an upcoming version starring Keira Knightley [""Pirates Of The Carribean"" see my review on it; sequel coming soon] set to hit theaters this year at the earliest), but it's all well and good. Special features include deleted scenes, Emma Thompson's Golden Globe speech, theatrical trailers and more.

Great cast, terrific screenplay, top-notch acting, beautiful scenery (it was shot in the same locales described so meticulously by Jane Austen in her novel) and good directing make this period piece a movie to treasure for all time.

171001,4,0800141660,"...to be honest, prospective purchasers would be better served by purchasing a copy of the novel and the DVD separately. The book included with the set is very cheaply printed, is often difficult to read because of poor typesetting (facsimile of the original printing?), and doesn't even include a copyright. My suggestion is to find a good-quality paperback (Everyman's is probably fine and is certain to be priced right) that includes critiques, some annotation, and all the other goodies included with contemporary printings of literary classics. There's a reason why Jane Austen has been in print for 200 years, and it's not due to her being a ""dead white chick."" First-time readers are to be envied.
Austen translates very well to the screen, and this film joins a group of other very enjoyable screen adaptations of her works. The only extras on this disk are a trailer, two commentaries (both fun and informative), and a few deleted scenes that really would've served no purpose other than disturbing the pace of the film. There are a number of subtitle options, including various Asian languages (perhaps a concession to Ang Lee fans). The print is nice and sharp, and is widescreen but not--unfortunately--anamorphic, the sound is clear, and the soundtrack is beautiful and sparingly utilized.
The movie itself is a joy, and I'm delighted that something of this quality is actually produced these days. It's very true to the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the novel, and contains not one expletive or hint of innuendo (except of manners). Ms. Thompson and Mr. Lee manage to treat us to a consistently engaging slice of Regency life that reminds us that the reason why classics are still read is that they're relevant, ultimately, to the human experience in general. Virtually anyone, regardless of background, can relate to these characters and their situations.
Ignore quibblers who complain that Thompson is too old for the part; these are the same types who'd complain that Mary Martin was too old to play Maria in The Sound of Music. My advice is to always judge a performance, ultimately, as the sum of its parts, which often really is greater than scrutiny of its individual components would indicate. This film is a winner any way you add it up, and is definitely worth owning.",1106697600,5,2298,4.940568475452197
171002,4,0800141660,"Anyone who sees ""Pride and Prejudice"" first will be disapointed. Not that the film makers didn't stick to the book, they did, and very well. But the plot is no where near as fast paced as the former. I read ""Pride and Prejudice"" and absolutly loved it, as does everyone who reads it. So I began reading the others. None measure up. But this movie is ok. Despite Hugh Grant's performance, which comes off as being quite immature. Yes, Edward was shy, but he didn't behave like a little boy. Everyone else was perfect for their roles. Especialy Fanny. They did clip out a few chracters, but it is for the best. They would have complicated things too much for a movie. Over all a pretty decent film.",1106006400,,696,4.4453125
171003,4,0800141660,"Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is the tale of the 'second' Dashwood family:  a mother and three daughters who didn't inherit when the father passed away.  The heir swore a deathbed oath to take care of his his step-mother and step-sisters, but his wife, Fanny (I couldn't think of a more appropriate name myself!) talked him out of it at every turn.

The second Dashwood family:  Mrs. Dashwood, the mother,  Miss Dashwood--aka Eleanor the eldest (Thompson), Marianne (Winslet), and Margaret, are forced to move to a country cottage and fend for themselves on the $500 a year stipend the estate grants them.  Of course, in the 1800's they cannot have a career.  Further, since they don't have any money for a dowry their matrimonial prospects are not very good, either.

Along the way, Marianne learns some lessons about faith and devotion from Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  I'm a huge Rickman fan and this is one of his best performances.  You get used to him playing villanous roles and Colonel Brandon hardly seems like him.

Eleanor also discovers Edward Farris (Hugh Grant).  I can't say the pair of them give the most spirited performance in the movie, but that's what their characters are about, too.

Overall, beautifully filmed, costumed and acted.  ""Pride and Prejudice"" is still my favorite Austen, but this one's a good close second.",1105833600,4,1354,4.96
171004,5,0800141660,"Not to sound seriously sexist, but complicated romances are usually the subject of movies geared toward the feminine sensibility, as it were.  However, the incredible literacy of the source material, the wonderful performances (even Hugh Grant is delightful here, to say nothing of Thompson, Rickman, and Winslet), and Ang Lee's delicate touch, all make for a perfect film experience, in my opinion.  Jane Austen uses this dramatic comedy of manners to explore timeless facets of love, with TWO concurrent romances being pursued against the tides of prudence and social obligation endemic to the class and era.  The resolution of both of these romances is breathtakingly dramatic--most especially Thompson's emotional catharsis, which reflexively brings me to tears just thinking about it.

The film also works as a sort of historic speculative fiction--imagine a world, before Freud and Oprah, when the cautious consideration of others' feelings was paramount, rather than the intemperate expressions of one's own.  Weird, isn't it?

In short, this is simply my favorite film of its genre ever, perfect in every way.",1105574400,8,1117,5.427745664739884
171005,5,0800141660,"This movie is so much fun. Back in the 70s, when I was the only geek girl in high school reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS and all titles by Jane Austen, little did I suspect that anyone would ever make hugely popular movies out of what (at that time) was fare for only the most devoted of bookworms.

The adaptation of this classic author by actor/screenwriter Emma Thompson is superb. However, many of the other reviewers have praised Thompson's brilliance in detail, so instead I'll touch on another favorite feature of mine: the supporting cast.

Remember Siegfried Farnon, the older, robust vet from ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL? His name is Robert Hardy and here he plays the kindly but rambunctious uncle. Somehow, somewhere they found an actress to play his mother who is so like Robert Hardy in looks and personality, you'd swear they were blood relatives. This lively, raucous pair gift the Dashwood sisters and their bereaved mother with a humble cottage when they're left homeless (or, rather, mansionless) by the death of their father. Generous deeds aside, if there's juicy gossip to be had, these two will be sure to ""winkle it out of you.""

There are too many wonderful supporting roles in this movie filled by excellent actors, so I'll mention just one more. Harriet Walter plays Fanny Dashwood to perfection - the stingy in-law who's gone power-drunk now that her husband has inherited the home and wealth his sisters have just lost. In one pivotal scene, Fanny coaxes the secretly engaged Lucy Steele to spill her romantic secret. ""I'm as silent as the grave,"" says the horrible Fanny, leaning in close to the unsuspecting girl. As she leans, you get the distinct impression she *is* the grave. And all from one look. Harriet Walter plays the villain with a sense of humor about herself that can only be described as delicious.

The title of this story refers to the dispositions of the two older Dashwood sisters. ""Sense"" is the practical and commonsense Elinor, played by Emma Thompson - the ultra-responsible elder sister who appears not to give in to the longings of her heart. ""Sensibility"" refers to the demonstrative Miss Marianne, played by Kate Winslet, who wears her heart on her sleeve and pooh-poohs anyone who doesn't. Through a series of misunderstandings, plus a fine collection of hilarious and dramatic incidents, the tables are turned and the sisters walk a mile in one another's shoes.

My husband enjoyed this one as much as I did. And I'm pleased to report that the movie is 100% worthy of the book.",1105401600,7,2536,4.820689655172414
171006,5,0800141660,"What else is there to say about this film besides the fact that it is charming, funny, touching and just bloody great!

Emma Thompson penned the flawless screenplay, adapted from Jane Austen's 1811 novel of the same name. The story centres around Elinor and Marianne, two fatherless sisters who have been forced to accept their fate as women unlucky in love and station or can things improve themselves?

* The casting! It is just perfect. It couldn't be bettered: Thompson, Winslet, Rickman, Wise, Grant,Jones were all brilliant, never over-acted but did exactly what was needed to immerse the viewer into the story. One stand out pair of the film is Mr and Mrs Palmer, friends of Col. Brandon, played with wit and humour by Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton. They were just hilarious! Kudos has to go to Harriet Walter (Fanny Dashwood) and Imogen Stubbs (Lucy Steele) as well, just great.

* The locations in films are really important for the visual effect and authenticity - S&S doesn't disappoint, showing the stunning English countryside of Devon and Cornwall in Regency times, making it all the more believable.

* Top class period film and another great Austen film adaptation. Shame period films aren't as good as this anymore!

--> Besides the wicked nature of this film, the DVD is very good as well. I am so pleased to see an international range of subtitles ranging from Dutch, Danish,Italian and Swedish amongst others. The deleted scenes, excellent commentaries, interesting trailers and Thompson's funny Golden Globe acceptance speech round off this cool DVD. 'S&S' is one DVD where the distributers FINALLY make the special features complement the film. (NB: In terms of special features, this review refers to the Region 2 DVD)

Well done!

171007,5,0800141660,"Lush production value encompasses this flawless film based on the classic Jane Austen novel.  Emma Thompson is triumphant both as the title character and as a screenwriter.  Her adaptation is beautifully written and loaded with emotional subtleties, as is her performance.  Kate Winslet plays her sister in the film, a perfect foil of unrepressed passion to her sister's reserved depth of character.  The entire cast is magnificent, for that matter.  There are so many different characters entering and exiting the story that there is never any threat of boredom for lack of interesting people.  The story itself is actually fairly simple, but it is the people who inhabit this fascinating time and place who both complicate and enhance everything around them.  The cinematography is sumptuous, with deep greens and glowing sunshine, misty grays and extravagantly colorful indoor settings.  The costumes are gloriously adorned and appropriately designed for the era.  The look of this film is fantastic!  Then there is director Ang Lee, better known today for his stellar work on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  His previous film, ""Eat Drink Man Woman,"" more than hinted at his prowess as a possible international success with ""Sense and Sensibility.""  His work here is outstanding.  This film was nominated for 7 Oscars, winning only for Best Adapted Screenplay going to Emma Thompson.  Another movie entitled ""Braveheart"" won Best Picture that year.  Other films along similar lines as ""Sense and Sensibility"" that I recommend highly are ""Howard's End,"" in which Emma Thompson won the Best Actress Oscar but which is inexplicably not available on DVD, and an eccentric gem called ""Impromptu,"" in which she has a smaller role within yet another exceptional cast of actors.

Thompson, Rickman and Grant are meant to act with each other. They are brilliant and this story is perfect for them. If you have the opportunity to watch or even buy this movie, you will not be disappointed. The only thing missing is Kenneth Branagh.

171009,4,0800141660,"I have heard the complaint that Emma Thompson was too old to play Elinor.  Incredible!  With the abundance of 50+ male actors playing action leads, I find this type of criticism out of place!  I liked Thompson's version of Elinor because I have never met an eighteen year old with the good sense that Elinor had.  It made sense to have Elinor a little older, because she is so wise, so practical, so insightful that no teenager could possibly display all those things.  I felt that this ""Elinor"" was a close friend.  I have always admired the Elinor character from the book because to live life, you can't always say or express what you really feel - it's not expedient.  Many times pure emotion makes a bad situation worse.  Elinor knew that.  She felt all that Marianne felt; however, she knew her actions would adversely affect other people and could worsen the situation.  She acted accordingly.  She used her head, but she did not lack heart.  Thompson conveys all this extremely well.  On a scale of 1 to 10, Emma Thompson receives a 10 from me.

Kate Winslet was a tremendous Marianne.  Marianne was as an idealist, yet comes to learn that realism too has value.  She learns there should be a time for both things in life.  Winslet portrayed Marianne's coming of age beautifully.  Marianne realizes that more than attraction is needed in marriage; friendship, respect and esteem are what make a person endure through life's hardships; that is what makes a relationship last.  This fact was very well presented in Winslet's performance.  Another 10.

I enjoyed Hugh Grant's performance as Edward.  Grant did not play Edward as a weak man; he played him as a mild, honorable man who had made a bad decision and was paying the consequences of that bad decision.  Well done.

I have never seen anything done badly by Alan Rickman yet, and never hope to.  His adaption of Colonel Brandon was excellent.  He played a man who had faced a great deal of disappointment in life, and yet, was not left bitter by it.  When he saw Marianne's idealism, he remembered his idealistic days and loved her for her possession of that quality.  I think that's terribly romantic.  Rickman did it well.

Imogen Stubbs was excellent as the nasty Lucy Steele.  It must have been an incredibly fun part to do!  Sly, malicious little devil!

Now about what I didn't agree with in the film.  I do not understand why the scene between Willoughby and Elinor during Marianne's illness never takes place in this movie!  It's pivotal in the book.  It explains so much!  Ten minutes should have been added to the movie.

Also, Lady Middleton should have been left in the script.  She rounds out the cousins that are well meaning, but difficult to live with.  She is also the driving force behind having Lucy stay at the Middleton's country home and bringing Lucy to town.

However, the movie was a very good one and should receive high accolades from all.  The casting was excellent, the acting was of high quality, and the direction well done.  Buy the movie, it's worth it!",1100217600,10,3048,4.6716981132075475

171011,4,0800141660,"When I first saw this movie after I read the novel, I was disappointed. I know that screenwriters are often forced to leave out scenes and details in adapting a novel--this movie would have to be a mini-series if Emma Thompson hadn't done some trimming. But what I didn't understand was why Thompson (whom I've always liked) ADDED scenes and subplots, made changes that didn't seem to save time or add clarity, and eliminated at least one semi-important character (the elder Ms. Steele) wholesale.

Still, there's no denying it's an excellent movie, from the art direction and costumes to Thompson's crafting dialogue that sounds as though it's direct from Austen's pen.

I've found the movie grows on me, though. This was especially true after I watched this DVD version with the commentary track by Thompson and producer Lindsey Doran. Yes, this is an unabashed chick flick, and I found the all-chick commentary refreshingly casual and well-informed (and relatively free of the usual self-congratulatory tones). Thompson's obvious familiarity with and appreciation for Austen's work (as well as her knowledge of the social conditions--such as limited options for women--of Austen's time) slowly made me forgive and understand her changes.

As for the acting, I don't think it could be better: Thompson, Alan Rickman, Kate Winslett, and even Hugh Grant were all great. But I also had a gripe with Thompson and Grant being so much older than their characters are in the book (19 and 23 respectively). This gripe isn't cosmetic or ageist. It's clear that Thompson and Grant are both in their thirties in the movie. This implies more knowledge about life and love than ages 19 and 23. One could say Elinor is always mature for her age, but the irony of how mature she has to be for her age is somehwat lost when the actress playing her (even when playing her very well) is so much older than the character. On the upside, Elizabeth Spriggs is an absolute delight as Mrs. Jennings.

If you feel Thompson's taken too many liberties with her screenplay, view the movie with her commentary; if it doesn't make complete amends, it should at least console you.",1096156800,5,2152,4.920110192837465
171012,3,0800141660,"One might nitpick about how this or that bit of the original novel out to have been left in or taken out, but it is, on the whole, a good adaptation.

Unlike some authors of 'social' novels, Jane did not invite us to become angry about unjust social situations, nor did she counsel us to resign themselves; she simply presented them and left us to draw our own conclusions.

The Dashwood girls had to get married.  In Britain of that time, that was all that they could do.  Their father's estate was entailed, which means that most of it automatically passed to their half-brother.  Women in that time were not educated beyond basic literacy and numeracy, and most well-paying occupations were closed to them by either law or custom.  In a Catholic country (say, Spain or Italy) young ladies in the Dashwood girls' position would have had the option of becoming nuns, but in Protestant Britain even that was not an option--it was marriage or nothing.

Did Jane's unpitying, but nonjudgmental, portrayal of this situation lead to the nascient feminist movement of the later 19th century, which saw educational and occupational opportunities for women open up and legal reforms that enabled women to control their own money and property?  Perhaps, indirectly; certainly her novels brought the situation to people's minds, and probably got them thinking about it far more than more polemical writings would have.

I did think that the one sister's mooning after Willoughby got a bit tiresome, but I think it was supposed to be.  And, after he lead the other sister on so much and then allowed her to think that he'd married someone else (the someone else married his brother--nice bit of casting, the actor who played the brother did look enough like Hugh Grant to be his less-handsome brother) and then came calling to propose that she should have taken one of the pewter candlesticks on the table and whapped him upside the head with it before accepting the proposal.

My father has four sisters, and says that the way the girls bickered and fussed at each other is absolutely on target.

As for some of the actors/actresses being too old for their parts, remember that in those days people didn't live as long as they do now.  In terms of life-stage they were right; a modern performer of the chronological age of the book's characters would be too immature.

My main quarrel with this movie was the music.  Not the music itself, which I liked (it was specially composed, but sounded period; the main theme, for example, sounded like a snippit from a Beethoven piano concerto) but the performance.  The piano used was obviously a modern instrument; pianos of the period had a thinner, lighter, sound than modern ones do--the fortepiano was marked, after all, as an enhanced harpsichord.  To see the characters playing on little spinnets and hearing a Boesendorfer was a bit disconcerting.",1095897600,11,2888,4.8492871690427695
171013,4,0800141660,"Sense and Sensibility wasn't the strongest or most well-developed of Jane Austen's novels, but the characters will still draw you in, especially as they are portrayed so well in this movie version.  The film is visually beautiful (it has the quality of a brightly colored painting), and the performances are absorbing.  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet play Elinor and Marianne Dashwood respectively, two sisters whose family has been made poorer after their father's death.  Elinor is a sensible and practical young lady, so level-headed in fact that Marianne wonders whether she will ever love passionately; Marianne, on the other hand, is a decided romantic, easily swayed by flowers, poetry and pretty talk.  In the movie they experience the highs and lows of love, and come to learn more about one another and lean upon each other as sisters should.

On the male side of the equation are Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), John Willoughby (Greg Wise), and Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Elinor comes to feel deeply about the genial, slightly bashful Edward (more than anyone can guess), but must keep her feelings restrained when she discovers that he is promised to another.  As for Willoughby and Brandon, both men factor in Marianne's life.  Willoughby is young and dashing, sweeping Marianne off her feet and playing to all her fantasies of romance; Brandon is an older man who knows he has slim chances with Marianne, and for most of the movie resigns himself to admiring her from afar.

The movie is not always tidy in bringing these relationships to resolution (just as the novel is not), but the acting is wonderful, particularly Emma Thompson as Elinor and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.

The casting is perfect.  I thought it very silly that Emma Thompson was going to be the 19 year old Eleanor, and since she produced the movie I thought that was just silly vanity.  But she is actually perfect as the too-sensible-for-her-own-good Eleanor.  Kate Winslet is great as flaky Marianne.  Even little Margaret (Austen's only fully-realized child character) is great as the spunky pre-teen.  I remember when the movie came out one reviewer said that Hugh Grant's character ""looks like he's forgotten to take the coat hanger out of his clothing"" and that is so true... but he's so good as the clueless cad.
The film is beautifully shot, with great sets and scenery.  It's a little hard for a modern person to understand why the Dashwoods were so upset to have to move to such a charming cottage!  Historical perspective is maintained in the movie, though.
It is also very well written, with my very favourite line in any movie appearing (though I've read the book twice looking for it).

171018,5,0800141660,"I love movie adaptations of Jane Austen classics. I don't like reading her books, because they are too lengthy (eg. Mansfield Park), but watching movies based on them is a whole different story.
Ang Lee added his delicate touch to this one. The story flows on scene by scene smoothly, and he had a great cast. Emma Thompson is able to show Eleanor to be a strong-willed woman, introverted, but nevertheless sensible. Kate Winslet gave a strong performance as the impulsive, free-spirited Marianne. The contrast provided by both actresses is what drives the movie. After all, Marianne is Sense, for she relies on the senses of her heart, and Eleanor is Sensibility. Alan Rickman, as always, gives us a spectacular portrayal of the Colonel - wise and old, and deeply in love with Marianne. We feel and at the same time, comprehend his concern for Marianne, and at once, he gains our sympathy as well as respect.
Hugh Grant is disappointing as usual. I'm not a fan of Hugh, so perhaps I'm being biased here, but I find his stammering, and blinky eyes really annoying (the guy can't even speak right!). Half the time he is mumbling, and his enunciation is so poor it is hard to catch what he is saying.
If Hugh doesn't get too much on your nerves, and if you love a little bit of romance, drama, and comedy, this is definitely your cup of tea.

171020,5,0800141660,"Thanks be to Emma Thompson for bringing this marvellous Jane Austen novel to life so beautifully and respectfully!
Let me first remind all reviewers and fans that this story is NO where near the Victorian Era! As an English major and bibliophile, it makes me cringe to read how many people think so. It's like saying that 2000 is the Kennedy era. All Austen is GEORGIAN England, over fifty years before Victoria ever came to the throne; England under the reign of George III/IV; the era of Napolean (the Regency era), complete with less constrictive Grecian-inspired clothing for the women! (Regency: hence the term, EMPIRE waist) By contrast to the rigid manners and clothing of the successive eras, this era is VERY liberal and free, almost contemporary (to our own). Women were not so restricted at this time as they later would be. Isn't that obvious by Marianne's behaviour throughout? =) (And look at Lizzy in P&P! No Victorian woman would have behaved so!)

Now to the film: While many changes were made from its source - no Lady Middleton and child, and no child of Mr and Mrs John Dashwood (John and Fanny) - I am guessing that these ommissions of children must be due to the fact that these children were so young, and not all movie makers want to deal with directing young kids. That is all I can think of to excuse this ommission. What we lose is how different the mothering of Mrs Dashwood and Fanny is, as well as how different Sir John Middleton is from his wife- the former extremely gentile and well natured, the other completely snobby. What we also lose is the chief reason John and Fanny would NOT give the Dashwood girls any financial support, lest it ""ruin himself and their poor little Harry"". Alas, we see soon enough through Thompson's wonderful screenplay that the step-siblings care for nothing but themselves and this is thrown wonderfully into relief by Elinor, Marianne, Margaret and their mother's more generous behaviour, as well as that of Mrs Jennings and her son-in-law, Sir John Middleton. This said, we lose, too, the contrast between sisters in THIS family - the difference between Charlotte and her sister Lady Middleton. A shame, but still a wonderful film.
Keira Knightly is today's Kate Winslet. They are both young, beautiful talented girls. Watching this film again, reminded me how much I loved and currently miss Winslet's acting. Winslet is the perfect Marianne: vibrant, rash, passionate, and utterly Romantic.
I had reservations at first about how old was Emma Thompson for the role she played! But she pulls this role of Elinor off admirably, my favourite moment of her acting is when she utterly breaks down at the bedside of her feverish, ill sister - a stirring performance that brought tears to my eyes. As much as I love this film and love the two actors, I could not suspend belief that there was actual chemistry between Grant and Thompson - their performances both made it seem as though they were merely old friends who enjoyed each other's company, not lovers who had been divided with heartache by another (ie, Lucy Steele). Indeed the actor's relationship seemed to seep through into their characters, and this was a shame, as I felt some poignancy was lost.
This did not, however, impede any of the fine acting: A finer bumbling Edward was ne'er to be found, and Grant is his usual awkwardness fits this artless, affectionate man to a ""T""! A great, comic role.
Alan Rickman's Col. Brandon was fantastic - he does not come across as being too old for his role, and is so handsome in looks and performance as Brandon that it would have mattered anyway. He plays wonderfully a handsome, shy, hurt creature whose chemistry with Marianne was subtle, sober and beautiful, not rash and impulsive as was Marianne's and the dashing young Willoughby's, very smoothly played by an exquisite Greg Wise.
And what a difference for Hugh Laurie from his Blackadder days! I never thought it was the same person. But he is a fantastic actor, and this screenplay allows him, as Mr Palmer, to be both sardonic throughout and then suddenly revealed as compassionate - a complete alteration of character at the end, well played.
Marianne's singing is just lovely, and shows Kate Winslet a very talented girl. It's a shame there is no copy of her performance on any Soundtrack recordings, as countless fans would have purchased it for its amateur sweetness and artless, fine quality.
The pace is so quick that one does not notice that more than two hours have gone by, and it seems not enough time to have spent in this beautiful story.
So, with fine acting, directing and writing, marvellous costumes, gorgeous countryside scenery and a lush score, this movie can be enjoyed by Austen fans and non-Austen fans alike.",1078012800,,4757,4.8012195121951216

For ""Sense & Sensibility"" things were a little different.  I was basically against all chic flicks the first time I watched this.  I had been bored out of my mind by countless Daniel Steel movies, Molly Ringwold movies, soap operas and whatever else my female friends enjoyed watching.  However, out of desperation one night (as it was the only movie in the apartment I hadn't seen), I popped this one in and expected to be asleep and out of my misery shortly.
As the movie starts you are introduced to a family conflict something in the Cinderella order.  A nice old man with money is dying.  He is limited by the law in providing for his 2nd wife and their daughters  because the entire estate needs to go to the son to be preserved.  Therefore, on his deathbed, he requests that his son (from his first marriage) looks after them.  However, this son has a wicked, wicked wife who talks him out of almost all support, and these gentlewoman have to pack up and live off the generosity of distant relatives.
And so sets up all the dynamics of a typical Austin work (as I have since learned): very cool gentlewomen who don't have the dowry to make them desirable matches.  Will any gentlemen be willing to sacrifice monetary gain for true love or will the women end up as old maids?
While that plotline has been at the core of many boring, cliche, catty, or empty Victorian films, what Emma Thompson (actress and screenwriter) has done with this one is pure magic. Rather than focus on how different the era was (the dress, the parties, the etiquette), Thompson sucks you in to the humanity of the characters themselves.  Yes, they dress differently and have different societal rules placed upon them.  But they feel and love and dream as we do.  She brings the whole world to life, showing how people like us express themselves though the mediums they had at the time - through music, poetry, significant looks, walks, etc.
Marianne's (Kate Winslet) story is moving and heart-breaking because of the disillusionment of her youthful confidence and trust.  She represents the ""Sense"" in the movie - one who trusts her feelings and the feelings of her beloved.  She lives how we are often encouraged to live today - to do what feels right and to express everything.  Elinor's (Emma Thompson) role, on the other hand, is one of the most mature I've ever seen in a film.  As the ""Sensible"" sister, she follows the Victorian era values when it comes to confiding in others, expressing herself, and expecting anything from her true love (Hugh Grant).  Yet you see that she does this not out of mindless obedience but because she understands the wisdom behind such etiquette.  When her heart finally breaks in spite of all of her carefulness and reserve, yours breaks with her and I cried for the first time in years.
I don't want to spoil the ending (and don't worry, I haven't), but Thompson wraps this movie up to perfection.  She seems to have done everything perfectly in the film - from the timing, the character development, the resolution, etc.  Ever since I have seen this film, I have yeared for another to bring me to that era in a similar manner but have yet to find one.  There are some good ones out there, but nothing touches what was accomplished in this film!",1076371200,3,3435,4.615131578947368
171022,5,0800141660,"Let's face it: Jane Austen film adaptations have a reputation both for being slow and for being chick flicks.  Yet here we have a male reviewer who hasn't read any one of her novels who's also telling you that this is one the finest movies he's ever watched.

I have seen a great many of Victorian-era films and I believe this picture captures the old fashioned ""English reserve"" more amusingly than any other.  Everybody acts so decent and proper that it really makes you laugh.  How did people ever express themselves and let out their true feelings in that day and age?  Maybe they didn't.

As with any movie bearing costumed actors and beautiful English countrysides, it is also a great looking film.  The casting is perfect, with Hugh Grant in a shining moment of his career and Emma Thompson giving an unforgettable over the top climactic performance.  My advice to the men out there is to give this movie a try because you'll get more out of it than you will with Terminator 2.

If someone hasn't read the book certain parts of the story seem vague, such as the relationship between Edward and Lucy.  The performances by the cast, especially Winslet and Rickman were top notch.  In my opinion this has been Kate Winslet's best performance yet and she should have won the oscar.  I usually like Emma Thompson, but to put it blunt, she was about twenty years too old to play Elinor.

171029,5,0800141660,"I haven't read any Jane Austen, for which I fervently apologize, but the early nineteenth century is well captured in the scenes in both countryside and London, as well as the costumes.
The Dashwood family, the mother and three daughters Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, has fallen on hard times due to their residence at Norland being given to eldest son John and his wife Fanny following the death of Mr Dashwood.  Consequently, they are reduced to being visitors.
Edward Farris (Hugh Grant) is very soft-spoken and kind of wooden, yet he is more sensitive to the Dashwood's plight than his sister Fanny.  He is talented at being tactful and clever, given the way he draws out the youngest sister Margaret, ever hiding in her treehouse and under furniture.  He is described as being loyal to a commitment, refusing to go back on one's words.  Honourable traits indeed for a gentleman.  He wants to be in a parish in the quiet countryside, hating London and its lack of peace, but his families has high expectations for him.
The eldest sister Elinor (Emma Thompson) is quite taken by Edward but she has suppressed any feelings by seeing things sensibly, perhaps to the point of being denied happiness.  After all, any future between them is hampered by their social standing.  The Dashwoods have fallen down in status, and Edward would stand to be disinherited if he married beneath his station.
Marianne (Kate Winslet) though does not find Edward too passionate.  There's something wanting in him, ""too sedate"", as she tells Elinor.  ""To love is to burn, to be on fire, like Juliet, or Guinevere, or Heloise.""  A tried and true romantic, and thus the one I connect to the most.  She would definitely take issue with Fanny saying ""Love is all very well, but unfortunately, we can't all rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable direction.""  She falls for Willoughby, a gentleman of ostensiblu good standing, and despite the short time between them, believes that ""time alone does not determine intimacy.""  She also wishes Elinor would be less restrained.  ""Always resignation and acceptance.  Always prudence and honor and duty.  Where is your heart?""
The youngest Margaret, is twelve, and is in a world of her own, reading atlases, living in a tree house, and imagining many scenarios, including herself being a captain of an expedition.  I was like that when I was young, and I was simply enchanted.
Their move to Barton Cottage, on the estate of Mother Dashwood's cousin Sir John (Robert Hardy of All Creatures Great And Small) and his mother-in-law Ms. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) proves to be a curse and a blessing, the former because of the impossibility of keeping secrets, especially with a cheery Ms. Jennings.
The social class strictures, such as marrying within one's own class, money and breeding being the important factors, the concept of primogeniture may seem dated today, but the hopes of escaping those strictures, or any strictures imposed in any time makes this movie and the novel relevant today.
All the performers are wonderful here.  However, it's interesting to see Hugh Laurie (Jeeves and Wooster, Blackadder), usually so full of goofy wackiness playing it so tempered and buttoned down as Palmer, and he does it well.  It's a joy to see Kate Winslet as the romantic Marianne, before she plunged into fame in Titanic.  Alan Rickman does wonders as the ever-brooding but understanding Colonel Brandon, whose face belies a pained past.  He even tells Elinor that maybe it's better for Marianne not to learn the ways of the world, that it's better for her not to hide her emotions, and is well aware of the ""impolitic cruelty in dividing two young people long attached to one another.""
Despite Marianne's travails, I say it's better to use one's heart and not one's head for one's destiny.  After all, ""can the soul really be satisfied with such polite affections?""  I feel not so.",1062028800,2,3913,4.886535552193646

171032,5,0800141660,"Some people have comfort food to help them through dull, drizzly evenings. I have comfort films, and Ang Lee's, (and Emma Thompson's), ""Sense And Sensibility"" is one of my favorites. I have watched this movie several times since I first saw it, and it never fails to lift my spirits.
This glorious romance of mores and manners, set during England's Regency Period, is very faithful to Jane Austen's brilliant novel. The film vividly brings the novel, with all its characters, to life. The plot focuses on two of the three Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, and their extremely different temperaments. Emma Thompson wrote this wonderful screenplay and earned an Academy Award for her efforts. She added pizzazz to the film, with an extra dash of drama, some humor, splendid panoramic views and a fabulous ball scene.
A lovely, young Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood to perfection. Marianne is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance as Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters. She has a more practical, sensible temperament. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Ms. Thompson gives Elinor a wicked, dry sense of humor, and her character adds much wit to the dialogue. Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.
The movie opens dramatically, with Mr. Dashwood, the girls' father, on his deathbed, begging his son and heir, (by his first marriage), to please take care of his wife and three daughters after he dies. The spineless John Dashwood sincerely promises his father to do so, and then is persuaded not to by his greedy wife, Fanny, in a wonderful satire-filled scene. Before Elinor, Marianne, their adorable younger sister Margaret, and their mother are forced to leave their home, the Norwood estate, they meet Fanny's brother, the shy and kind Edward Ferrars, (Hugh Grant). Over a period of a few weeks, while the women are packing their belongings, Elinor and Edward grow obviously fond of each other. Their attachment is interrupted by Fanny, who senses the bond forming between her sister-in-law and her brother, and urges the four Dashwood women to leave immediately for their new home.
Upon arriving at their new residence, Barton Cottage, near the estate of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin John, the women meet their relatives and some new neighbors. Colonel Brandon, played by the charismatic Alan Rickman, is included in the welcome party. Brandon is drawn at once to the beautiful, musical Marianne, who does not reciprocate his affection. Instead she falls madly in love with the dashing Willoughby, and Greg Wise is extremely dashing in his persuasive performance as the reckless, feckless young suitor.
The family settles in and explores their surroundings. Elinor waits in vain for Edward to visit her at Barton Cottage. Willoughby's expected marriage proposal to Marianne is unexpectedly interrupted. Two unhappy sisters travel to London for the season, hoping to settle their romantic affairs, and instead, find their dreams thwarted.
I won't give the story away, but it is a tale told wonderfully well, dramatized to perfection by extraordinary actors, and directed by the incomparable Ang Lee. Too many superlatives? You won't think so after you have seen ""Sense And Sensibility.""",1058745600,10,3956,5.231496062992126

According to the great commentary that comes along with the DVD (really illuminating;  they run the entire film with behind-the-scences comments as the film runs...very enjoyable), the movie only used two lines from the Austen novel.  Hmmm, how true to the book can this movie be?

I don't know, and it really doesn't matter!  This movie stands well on it's own two (or more) reels.  I can't help but think that, based upon the other Austen adaptations I've seen, this is very much in the same vein.  The acting is superb, as you'd imagine, with a cast that includes Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kate Winslet, and Alan Rickman.

This DVD is a bargain, as I've watched it three times now, and found it enjoyable and entertaining every time.  The acting is first-rate, especially Thompson's.

171036,5,0800141660,"Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility comes to the screen in a visually stunning, beautifully acted film. Emma Thompson stars as Elinor Dashwood, the sensible older sister of Marianne (Kate Winslet), who is idealistic and passionate about life and love. Elinor falls in love with the handsome and wealthy Edward (Hugh Grant), who may be keeping a secret from her. Marianne is completely besotted with the dashing and mysterious Mr. Willoughby. She, however, is persued by a much older and very conservative nobleman, Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman), who has a painful past.
The film follows the sisters on the road to love and happiness, which is quite a bumpy road, due to the rigorous constraints of 18th century society and manners. In the end, of course, true love previals for both sisters, as we always knew it would.
The English countryside is photographed in its splendor and the period homes and costumes are a delight. Emma Thompson captivates as the long-suffering Elinor, and Alan Rickman steals the show as the pitiable Colonel.

  Sense and Sensibility is, like Pride and Prejudice, a story taking place in the Victorian era, telling you of the caste system that often created catastrophic incidents. Such is the story of our own Sense and Sensibility. One one hand you have the Dashwood family, dignified and proud, but undeniably poor. There is no longer a Mr Dashwood as he has passed away. Therefore, the Dashwood's having no money (though it was supposed to be supplied by cousin John), move into a cottage. There Jane, the eldest meets Edward, a polite and handsome, yet uninteresting man who immediately falls for Jane. Jane also falls for him (her being the unadventerous type) and they are infatuated with each other. Problem: Edward is heir of a vast estate, and later, it's revealed he's already engaged to a snotty upstart. He is one who does not break promises, and cannot be cajoled into breaking it off.
  Marianne, the middle sister is in love with Willoughby, a charming man who's not afraid of adventure. They fall in love, but unfortunately, it's revealed that Willoughby is involved in a scandal, and he marries someone for 50,000 pounds. Marianne is crestfallen, and falls into a state of moping loneliness.  But here steps Colonel Brandon. He reads to her excitingly, and they fall in love.

171039,5,0800141660,"With an engaging plot, witty dialogue, and consummate acting by an all-star British cast (there really isn't one performance that could even be described as mediocre here!), this is one of the most delightful films I've seen.  Emma Thompson received a well-deserved Oscar for this splendid screen adaption of Jane Austen's classic novel.  Indeed, it is rare that I enjoy a dramatisation more than the novel, but I must confess that I did so here.
This is a story about love and propriety in early 19th-century England, and it follows a chapter in the lives of the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet).  Their lives (together with those of their mother (Gemma Jones) and youngest sister) have been thrown into disarray by the death of their father (Tom Wilkinson), whose estate has been left to his son by a previous marriage (James Fleet--The Vicar of Dibley's Hugo).  At a time when money not only was equated with privilege and power but was essential for one's very survival, Elinor and Marianne, having neither an independent income nor dowries, are in the unenviable position (unlike Austen's Emma) of having to make a good marriage whilst having little but their appearance and personalities to recommend them.
Marianne, however, (the younger of the two) is an impetuous, idealistic romantic, for whom love must be some great all-consuming passion or it simply isn't love.  She wears her heart on her sleeve, and when ""love"" strikes in the dashing form of the dynamic Mr. Willoughby (Greg Wise) whom she takes to be a kindred spirit, she succumbs to her emotions.  Her overwhelming passion leads her to lose all common sense and act with reckless impropriety.
Marianne's love is of the kind idealised by the Romantic poets and authors of the time (of which Austen was NOT one!)--the kind of love which cares not a toss for propriety, reputation or other societally imposed values.  It is also, alas, oblivious to boring monetary concerns such as wealth or poverty--concerns which in the cold light of day (and as the story bears out) few could disregard for all their talk to the contrary, and which were ultimately the deciding factor in many a marriage.

Realistic rather than romantic, Elinor is of a calmer, more reserved nature, and not the sort to indulge in her emotions.  Indeed, if any fault can be found with her behaviour, it is that she is, perhaps, a little too reserved as even the object of her affections is unaware of her true feelings!  That said, she behaves sensibly, with dignity, and with concern for others, regardless of what she may be feeling inside (and this is also true of the gentlemen in the story--the real gentlemen, that is--played by Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant).
Though set some 200 years ago, this is truly a film of timeless value.  If you've enjoyed the Firth/Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice in particular or you enjoy period productions in general, you'll definitely want to check this one out.  But it's such a good film all around--clean, warm-hearted and with plenty of comic relief--that I believe it's appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for quality entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it most highly, and I look forward to reading the companion book: The Sense and Sensibility Screenplay and Diaries by Emma Thompson.",1052524800,,3385,4.907180385288966

Both become involved in complicated relationships with men, each pursuing love in their own ways.  Both actresses are terrific in their roles.  Thompson is a particular standout, and the scene at the end when her true emotions surface is a great moment.

Unfortunately, there are several scenes that exhibit pixelization that breaks apart background information.  There is also the inclusion of some minor edge enhancement that, while not terribly obtrusive, is nevertheless present.

171046,4,0800141660,"Let me say upfront, this is my least favourite Austen book. I found it slow, almost tedious and I had to force myself to finish it.  It lacks the sparkle of her other novels and I did not see at all what Eleanor saw in Edward in the book.  He was dull, dull, dull.
I found Emma Thompson's screenplay much more upbeat, witty and fun than the book and the casting helps as well.  Emma is spot-on as Eleanor, so proper and honorable.  Kate Winslet is the perfect Marianne - all emotion and passion running headlong before thought.  Greg Wise was absolutely yummy as Willoughby whose character got a bit kinder treatment from Ms Thompson than from Ms Austen.  And Alan Rickman was terrific as the lovelorn but stalwart Colonel Brandon.  Even Hugh Grant was welcome in the role of Edward (though I must say, I'm not a fan).
Also some great performances from the supporting cast:  Hugh Laurie was amusing as the snide Mr Palmer;  Harriett Walter as the snobbish and nasty Fanny;  Robert Hardy as the silly Sir John and Elizabeth Spriggs as the nosy Mrs. Jennings.
As I said before I enjoyed this treatment better than the book.
If you liked this, also try Persuasion starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root(not to mention the more obvious Pride and Prejudice and Emma).  Persuasion was, I believe, Ms Austen's last novel and it's definitely more contemplative and low-key in nature.  You may also want to investigate a short story by Suzanne Allain ""Incognito"" which is very much in the spirit of Austen and Wilde.

The movie focuses primarily on the two oldest sisters of the Dashwood family - Elinor (Emma Thompson) and her younger sister Marianne (Kate Winslet.)  Elinor is practical and independent-minded, caught between her societal position as a woman and what she wants for herself.  In contrast, Marianne is impetuous, artistic, passionate; she pursues her emotions as though nothing else matters.  When both sisters fall in love with different men, they react very differently to the awakening of their affections.
The acting in this film could not have been any better.  Although critics have complained that Emma Thompson is too old for the part of Elinor, she at once dispels all doubts with her expert performance.  She becomes Elinor so thoroughly that it's difficult to imagine another actress tackling this role.  As the romantic Marianne, Kate Winslet is charmingly breathless; she captures the essence of her character with seemingly no effort. Hugh Grant is awkwardly sincere as Edward, and the normally sinister Alan Rickman portrays with heartbreaking honesty the love-struck Colonel. To bring all this talent together, Ang Lee provides nuanced direction that captures both the beauty and the humanity of Austen's novel.
On the surface, this is a quiet movie, but underneath the turmoil of life - whether in Austen's time or ours - simmers.  Viewers who enjoy character-driven films should love it.",1045872000,179,1703,5.25830258302583

Blasphemy for some of you, but truly, Emma Thompson's screenplay is so well-written, you could sit down and read it -- with a cup of tea, of course -- and thoroughly enjoy every line.

The story revolves around thee Dashwood sisters who were once rich and famous but losing all of them and searching towards their destiny.

The elder sister Elinor - the sensible - and loves Ferras; the younger Marianne is very romantic and attracted deeply to Willoughby when Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.

Particularly noteworthy is Emma Thompson as Elinor Dashwood, because she not only stars in the film but also wrote the screenplay! Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman are also great in their roles as Marianne, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon - and as a fan of ""All Creatures Great & Small,"" I can't leave out Robert Hardy, who plays Mrs. Dashwood's (Gemma Jones) jovial cousin, Sir John Middleton.
If you've already seen this film and enjoyed it, you might want to check out a book, written by Emma Thompson, entitled ""The Sense & Sensibility Screenplay And Diaries"".  It contains the entire shooting script as well as Thompson's account of what making the movie was like, and it's just as awesome as the film itself.",1045180800,8,824,4.795774647887324

And the director, Ang Lee, did an amazing job of capturing the story through such a simple and understated way, yet it hardly comes across the film that way!

171053,3,0800141660,"All you have to do is look at the cover of this DVD to realize that this movie was made to appeal to women, but after having seen it, I doubt that even the most amorous woman would find this movie appealing.
Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet play two sisters named Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.  Both are bachelorettes whose father has recently died and left them virtually impoverished, and who seem to want nothing more than to get married.  The movie is set in 19th century England, and given the customs in those days, I suppose it was acceptable for marriage to be a woman's only aspiration in life.  Of course, marriage in that day-in-age was more of a merging of two people of similar social and economic stature than a solidification of love.  Elinor (Thompson) is the ""sensible"" and conservative sister who comes off as comically prudish, and Marianne (Winslet) is younger and starry-eyed.  Marianne is courted by two gentlemen, and Elinor is courted by a man named Edward Ferrars (played by Hugh Grant), who is actually engaged to someone else, and has been for five years.  The only real suspense is in who will marry whom in the end.  Without giving away the ending, I'll only say that I was disappointed that both sisters married men who were not deserving of women of their high class.
This movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and I can see why.  It's visually attractive, the costumes are very interesting, the dialogue is extremely smart, and the performances by Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are very good.  However, even when you put all those things together into one movie, it's still entirely possible that the audience will not be entertained.  This movie was entertaining for the most part, but there were times when it felt extremely dry, and I found myself looking at my watch to see how much time had passed.
This is a movie that might be fun to see once, but I don't recommend spending money and actually buying it.",1043020800,2,1964,4.666666666666667
171054,5,0800141660,"How can a romantic comedy about seeking marriage mates win the Berlinale, one of the most prestigious film festivals? Well, this splendid adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel did just that in 1996, combining fabulous writing (and acting) of Emma Thompson and great directing of Ang Lee (""The Wedding Banquet"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").
Other performances are also first-class. Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant shine (personally, I've never seen a role to be so fitting for Grant, although ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""About a Boy"" came close). The whole cast is flawless.
When the film came out, even the self-proclaimed film saviour Quentin Tarantino could not help himself but quip: ""Who the F... is Jane Austen?"" Yes, this English author who lived 200 years ago wrote only romantic novels about girls (and men) who are in want of a spouse. But she achieved perfencion in this very limited space (the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" is probably the best). In this movie, the very human side -- the desire not to be alone, to spend a lifetime with the One -- is described with power. Finding the true love was the prime thing for the two Dashwood sisters. But, is it still not true for most of us, even in this cold, material world?
Emma Thompson, already an Oscar winner for her leading role in ""Howards End"" (1992), won the Oscar for this film's adapted screenplay, becoming the first artist ever to achieve such a feat -- winning the Academy Awards for both acting and writing.
Apart from saving all important aspects of the story, Thompson included very poignant and sharp moments in the script. When her character Elinor and Edward Ferrars (played by Grant) are on a cruise ride, she says, 'you inherit your money. We cannot even make it,' hinting at the situation of middle class women two centuries ago, when their fortunes depended heavily either on inheritance from father or property of husband -- and it was imaginable they should go to work. A great social commentary.
Beatifully shot, with delicate music score by Patrick Doyle, ""Sense and Sensibility"" is predominantly an entertaining film. But its social and human undertones are undeniable. It did win Berlin festival and the Golden Globe, but lost the Oscar race to ""Braveheart"". Maybe for the lack of great human topic that would rank it along ""Schindler's List"" or ""The English Patient"". Yet I feel that there was not the film in 1995 to deserve the big Oscar more than this one.

171056,5,0800141660,"Britain is possibly unique in that our world-renowned dramatic talent is, on occasion, actually less gifted than our apparent  ""second string"" company.  A fact which this production illustrates to perfection.
The script for ""Sense and Sensibility"" is the work of Emma Thompson (who also plays Elinor Dashwood), better known world-wide as Mrs Kenneth Brannagh, yet proving here that her own talents are easily the equal of her husband's.
Likewise seemingly supporting, but actually key roles, are filled by by Elisabeth Spriggs (Mrs Jennings) and Robert Hardy (Sir John Middleton), two players who, though not well-known to the world at large, have been the making of more productions than I've had hot dinners.
Taken at face value, the work of Jane Austen is little more than a historical version of Danielle Steele.  When it is the focus of a galaxy of such genuine talent as is collected here, however, it becomes far, far more - a genuine work of genius that transcends time and becomes not simply a piece of quaint English history but a tale that has something worthwhile - and entertaining - to say at any point in time.
You *may* find productions that equal this version of ""Sense and Sensibility"" in its chosen field, but you'll find VERY FEW that do any better.

Thompson takes some liberties with her version (Margaret is way more developed than in the Austen original) but she does a good job with it. Winslet is very pretty in her role and Thompson is a great Elinor-governs her feelings but feels things very intensely. Rickman is -as always-very proper and fits the role perfectly for the MOVIE. Keep in mind that Thompson does a lot to flesh out the male characters (to make them more appealing) than Austen did originally.

Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant (gotta love Hugh), Alan Rickman (gotta love Alan too)... they all contribute magnificently to this perfect telling of an intriguing and thoroughly heart-warming tale. Did I mention really funny too? Well it is... it is even laugh-out-loud funny at times.
Emma Thompson, and Kate Winslet play the Dashwood sisters-- the oldest (or should I say eldest?), Elinor (Emma Thompson), reserved, sensible, practical; the younger, Marianne (Kate Winslet), impetuous, spontaneous, passionate-- who along with their mother, and younger sister Margaret, are thrust into a less than favorable situation when their father dies. As a result of his death they are left to the mercy of their spineless half-brother, and his hateful, high-minded, selfish wife, who inherit their father's estate. Not for long though, as an offer is made to them which will allow them to part ways with their tormentors- the two thorns in their flesh. But not before Elinor takes interest in a certain visitor, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), finding love in the most unexpected place, only to have it seemingly snatched from her grasp (things get quite complicated)! Marianne too, soon *stumbles* into love... the kind she has always dreamed of... but her relationship seems ill-fated as well. Will the two ever find love?
It's very interesting to see how both react to their feelings, and in the end, to see which pays off: being sensible, or being impetuous, or, being both in balance. Oh, but the story is far deeper than that. There is much in this movie to dazzle and delight even the most critical of tastes. It is certainly one that you will never grow tired of watching... simply a wonderful, wonderful film. Emma, Kate, Hugh, Alan, Ang Lee (the director), everyone in this movie, and behind the scenes, helped to make it a true classic! I guarantee you will not regret buying it!

171059,5,0800141660,"A couple of weeks back, I saw the 1996 A&E production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Putting my ""real man"" self image at extreme risk, I admitted publicly that I enjoyed this most excellent film immensely. Pushing reputation even closer to the edge, I viewed the 1995 release of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY last weekend. (I need something to watch while doing the ironing.) The theme of both films seems to be ""anxious females seek Princes Charming to rescue them from rural spinsterhood"", which, on the knowledgeable authority of a good friend and Jane Austen obsessive, is common to all of the author's works. Feminists may cringe at that generalization, but there wasn't much in the way of bra-burning in the first decade of the 19th century when Austen was busy scribbling.
S&S opens at the side of Mr. Dashwood's deathbed, at which point he's leaving his entire estate to his son John (James Fleet) in conjunction with the latter's promise to financially provide for his half-sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois). Subsequently, though John gives lip service to generous support of his siblings, he's easily dissuaded by his selfish wife, Fanny (Harriet Walter). Soon, the three Dashwood sisters and their mother are tossed out of their Great House to live in a (rather large) cottage on a cousin's estate. With no dowries to back them up, the two eldest, Elinor and Marianne, are left to Fate and their own charms to attract men of means to wed. So, Elinor may or may not be favored by the younger of Fanny's brothers, Edward (Hugh Grant). And Marianne is adored by the socially awkward Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), but she only has doe eyes for the dashing Willoughby (Greg Wise). It's such a puzzle.
My opinion of S&S suffers from having previously seen P&P. It's difficult to be fair since the latter is by far and away the richer and more humorous presentation. Emma Thompson is, however, superb as the sensible sister who, while dealing with her own turmoil of the heart, must support the feelings-driven Marianne as the latter careens from one emotional extreme to the next. Alan Rickman is marvelous as the suitor tortured by the demons of unrequited love. On the other hand, I wasn't quite so impressed with Grant as Edward, who was painfully ill at ease in the presence of adult women. (A deer caught in the high beams comes to mind.) Normally, the unassuming shyness of Grant's roles is appealing, but this time it was a bit over the top. Either that or his Georgian-era shorts were bunched and his collar too tight. And because P&P is over twice as long as S&S, the script of the former could afford to include some minor personalities of cleverly done eccentricity. The costuming and choreography in S&S seemed a realistic depiction of the times, but I'm as poorly equipped to adjudicate now as I was for the same elements of P&P. One thing I can judge, though, is the English countryside that's like no other that I've enjoyed. Towards the end, there was the panoramic view of a wind-rippled, grassy valley sloping down to the sea, probably in Devonshire. I was so ""homesick"" that I teared just a trifle.
Because the pace of the story caused me to doze off for a couple of brief moments, I can't in good conscience award more than four and one-half stars. The review system of this site will round it up.",1030579200,6,3363,4.760273972602739

But only a couple of times and I have watched this movie more times than I care to report. And Alan Rickman was over 35 but he's ALAN RICKMAN and he provided a beautiful portrayl of Colonel Brandon.

171062,5,0800141660,"Jane Austen is a fine writer, but her wordiness tends to drain the life from many of her characters.  Thankfully, Emma Thompson recognized the limitations of the novel and adapted her screenplay accordingly, enhancing the humor of the original story and heightening drama to make the film more captivating.  A cast was then chosen, made up of very talented thespians, including Miss Thompson herself.  Add to that splendid English landscapes, excellent directing, haunting music, and superb cinematography, and what emerges is a modern masterpiece.

This is no movie for action fans; it is far too cerebral and requires a serious attention span.  For those who enjoy a good love story well told, this film delivers.  The characters are three-dimensional and their dilemmas full of human drama, bound as they are by the morals and manners of the times.  Three sisters and their mother are left virtually penniless by the stricture against females inheriting property then in place in English law.  The half-brother to the Dashwood women receives it all, but his selfish wife talks him out of helping his stepmother and half-sisters.  It is up to the two older girls---sensible Elinor and passionate Marianne---to seek their fortunes in romance while lacking a dowry to help them.

Elinor finds her soulmate in shy, retiring Edward Ferrars, brother of the selfish sister-in-law, a man lacking in the usual Victorian ambitions.  Her budding romance is shelved when his sister makes it clear that Elinor is ""unsuitable"" for Edward.  The sisters and their mother then go to stay in a cottage owned by a kindly relative, Sir John, and his mother-in-law, the irrepressible Mrs. Jennings.  The old woman is a confirmed gossip and matchmaker, bound to see one of the two sisters hitched up to Colonel Brandon, the most eligible bachelor in the area.

Brandon first sees Marianne singing a melancholy song and is incurably smitten.  She in turn loses her heart to a dashing young man named Willoughby, who is her ideal of a Victorian-era gentleman, complete with a pocket book of sonnets.  Brandon, who loves her more than his own happiness, steps aside and even encourages their relationship, despite his dislike for the handsome rogue.

Things take an unexpected turn for the worse for both sisters---Willoughby abruptly drops Marianne and flees to London with no explanation and Elinor discovers that Edward is engaged to a shallow young woman named Lucy Steele.  The ensuing twists and turns in the plot make this film both agonizing and entertaining to watch.  Mercifully, everyone winds up happy at the end wedded to the right person.

The whole film is solidly done, but it is the acting that really shines.  Thompson is perfect for the role of the calmer sister, while Winslett is brilliant as the mercurial Marianne.  Grant is endearing as the gentle Edward; Rickman finally gets to display his considerable ability to act the part of a very good and unselfish man.  The rest of the cast keeps pace with the leads, and Hugh Laurie is indescribably funny as the sarcastic Mr. Palmer.  One very beautiful aspect of this movie, along with the tendency to get drawn into the story, is the evocative musical score that tugs at the heartstrings.

All in all, this is a wonderful example of a film genre that is so often overlooked in today's world---period romance.  More movies like this one desperately need to be produced.

171065,3,0800141660,"Emma Thompson's adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is sure to have you leaving the theater.  This ""romantic"" style film is set in England during the late 18th Century.  The film is about a set of sisters who try to marry-off to the right man in the midst of their father's death.  Along the way, come three men who aid and attempt to court the two sisters, Marianne and Elinor Dashwood.  Eventually, the women marry.
 The only thing that ""Sense and Sensibility"" has going for itself is brainless feminine humor and awkward comedic timing.  This movie moves too slow and the romanticism is corny.  I think that this movie is a good representation of its time, however, you men should save your[money].  I do applaud Alan Rickman for a reel performance of a true, classy man.  Although, like all classy men, he was continuously the ""hero of the day"" but, conveniently put aside for another man until the end of the picture.
 Ang Lee, director of ""Sense and Sensibility,"" is no stranger to fame in Hollywood.  He has won seven awards for ""Sense and Sensibility"" and 13 awards for the highly praised ""Wo hu cang long,"" (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).  It is hard to compare these two critically acclaimed films by Lee since they are at the opposite ends of Hollywood's spectrum.  Sorry guys, no where in ""Sense and Sensibility"" will you see Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman throw down in a martial arts fight.  However, like ""Wo hu cang long"" Lee's direction of ""Sense and Sensibility"" is based on capturing the moment of human expression.  Such expressions can be seen in the various emotional breakdowns by Kate Winslet.
 Most critics agree that this film is an accurate representation of Austen's 1795 book.  Roger Ebert has also said that ""Sense and Sensibility"" is, ""an enjoyable film, and yet it left me somehow unsatisfied. I liked the wit, I liked the charm of the actors, I enjoyed the way that Rickman chewed his role as if he wanted to make it last, and the tension when Grant's Edward is made to suffer - particularly since he appears to be a cad only because he has tried to do the right thing. And I appreciated the way Thompson's Elinor kept her character's face carefully expressionless as she negotiated scenes in which some knew her secrets and others did not.""
 Men, this movie is not the cream of the crop.  However, you should be able to score points by recommending this film to your girl friends for their ""Friday Night Chick Flick .""

171066,5,0800141660,"If you liked the book by Jane Austen, then you MUST see this movie adaption.  Emma Thompson has done a wonderful job adapting Jane Austen's text to film -- the dialogue is just as snappy & fun as the writing.  This is one of those rare cases in which I liked the movie as well as the book.  The movie's setting & cast even exceeded the mental pictures I concocted in reading -- the Barton cottage & the choices of Hugh Grant for the role of Edward and Thompson & Winslet for the sisters are perfect matches for Austen's witty descriptions.  The few scenes from the book which are left out seem incidental to the heart of the story -- also, a few characters are left out or ""streamlined"" into one.  My only complaint is the ""Hollywood"" ending with Marianne's sudden transition to happiness.  Austen shows her gradually coming back around to love -- which seems much more true to life.  If you've read this book, you'll want to see the movie -- Thompson is to Austen as Kenneth Branaugh is to Shakespeare.  For those who HAVEN'T read Jane Austen's wonderful book, this is one of those rare cases in which you can watch the movie first & not feel dissatisfied with the book later.  Go ahead & indulge!  If you like a period movie, this is a lovely choice -- the depiction of late 18th century British society is both enchanting & funny.  If you've seen Hugh Grant in any of his later charming, self-effacing roles & liked him, then you must catch him in this movie -- it's the model for many of his later roles.  The costumes, the setting, the dialogue, the acting & the ""lesson"" are all wonderful here.  It's not action-adventure -- it's an Ang Lee film rather than a Bruce Lee movie.  Don't expect to like it if you prefer chase scenes & excitement.

The screenplay lacked clout, the direction was workmanlike at best, and the costumes and wigs seemed specially made to make everyone look as unattractive as possible.
Even the performances were not all that impressive with the notable exceptions of Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman, who were both excellent.  Imogen Stubbs, Imelda Staunton, and James Fleet were quite enjoyable too.  But as for the rest:  Emma Thompson was about 20 years too old to play Eleanor, and she came off as tired, wan, and unengaging.  Hugh  Grant is always far better when he's playing nasty, or at least smarmy characters, (An Awfully Big Adventure, Bridget Jone's Diary) while Gemma Jones was a bit of an anti-character as Mrs. Dashwood, and Hugh Laurie simply looked a bit lost (Staunton and Stubbs were stealing his scenes).

The BBC version did omit the third sister, Margaret, however the rest of the film and it's characters were intact and mirrored the book.

It centers around two sisters, who are very different, but a complement to each other.  Marianne, played by the beautiful Kate Winslet, and Eleanor played by the impeccably talented Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay).  What is so refreshing about Jane Austen's writing is how her novels seem contemporary even though they are not.  Her characters speak and behave in ways that anyone today might speak or behave.  The relationships in this film between Eleanor and Edward, and Marianne and Willoughby are very familiar to us because they are typical of a modern day relationship.  Who hasn't been in a situation like Eleanor?  You desperately want to be with someone, but you're too afraid to tell them, or there's someone else in the way?  Or maybe you've been in a relationship like Marianne's, where you're dumped for no apparent reason except money?

171072,5,0800141660,"Immerse yourself in the rich tapestry of life in London and Devonshire with Mrs. Dashwood and her three beautiful daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret. Mr. Dashwood has died, and due to the laws of inheritance in 19th century England, the handsome estate passes to the male descendants, and the Dashwood women are evicted by their evil sister in law, Fanny Dashwood, with only 500 pounds a year to support themselves. The Jennings', kind but eccentric cousins in Devonshire, offer them the use of their drafty stone cottage for a nominal rent, and they are packed off and moved with only one servant to attend to their needs.
Elinor (portrayed perfectly by Emma Thompson), the sensible oldest sister, has a tight rein on her emotions and is ever aware of the proprieties of single women in society, and struggles to keep within their budget. She mourns the fact that ladies are taught no useful skills, are not allowed to earn their living and are totally dependent on the largesse of men. She has also fallen in love with Edward Farris (Hugh Grant), the brother of Fanny, but Fanny is intent on keeping them apart, for the family has grander plans for Edward.
Marianne (Kate Winslet), is the emotional, romantic expressive younger sister who recites Shakespearean sonnets, and plays mournful, romantic songs on the pianoforte. She falls passionately in love with John Willoughby, the handsome rake from a nearby estate, who toys with her affections but never openly declares his love for her. All the while, she is being courted by Colonel Brandon, a mature thoughtful and sensitive gentleman who is smitten with this spirited middle sister.
The youngest sister, Margaret, still a child of 12 or so, is playful and loves to study her atlas and travel in her mind.
The verdant scenery, opulent period costumes, and lavish English manors and ballrooms will mesmerize you. The sisters are romantic, witty and funny, perfectly cast and supported by a wonderful cast of characters. This is a film that I will watch over and over to rediscover all the nuances of conversation and character interactions and revel in the beautiful scenery.

171075,5,0800141660,"The enormously talented Emma Thompson wrote the marvelous screenplay for this brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.
The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.
This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way. All comes out right in the end, however, but it is the getting there that makes this film a must see.
A witty, funny, and romantic film, it boasts a first class  ensemble cast. While Ms. Thompson may be a bit long in the tooth for the role which she plays, her thespian talents and charm enable her to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat.

171077,5,0800141660,"I suppose it makes perfect sense that if you want to make a 19th-century English romance novel into a superb film you hire an actress almost twice the age of the main character to not only play the role but also adapt the screenplay into a book and then hire a Taiwanese director to direct the film.  You might say, yes, such things happen in Hollywood, but the success of ""Sense and Sensibility"" is due to what transpired in England, not Southern California.  Having read the novel and the original screenplay, the largest share of credit goes to Emma Thompson, who deservedly received the Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation.  Thompson began by dramatizing every scene in the novel, which resulted in 300 hand written pages to be followed by 14 drafts as the 1811 novel was crafted into the final script.  The result was a script that manages to be not only romantic and funny, but also romantic and funny in the best Austen sense of both.

After watching the film again I focus on three particular points, which I think best reveal the strength of Thompson's script.  First, the entire introductory sequence, which induces us to like the Dashwood sisters because we are introduced first to their step-brother and his shrewish wife (credit for this particular sequence also goes to Film Editor Tim Squyres, who recut the scene so that we get all of one side and then the other instead of alternating back and forth as in the original script).  Our sympathies cannot help but be with the plight of Elinor and Marianne.  Second, the use of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not the marriage of true minds""), which Marianne and Willoughby share to their great mutual delight (except he gets a word wrong, in an elegant little bit of foreshadowing) and which Marianne repeats standing in the rain looking at Willoughby's new estate.  Third, Austen has Elinor bolt from the room to cry outside during the happy ending but Thompson creates a wonderful moment by having her stay in the room and having the rest of her family flee.  There are not too many scenes where you are crying and laughing at the same time, but Thompson certainly created one (and has the added virtue of relying on herself as an actress to nail the performance as well).  All of these are marvelous examples of playing to the strength of the cinema to bring Austen's novel to the screen.

The performances are first-rate, especially Kate Winslet as the passionate Marianne, Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon (the look on his face when Marianne thanks him for rescuing her is so wondrously touching).  Hugh Grant does find a way of slowing the delivery of his dialogue more than usual, but it does fit the overall pace of the film.  The supporting cast is exactly what you come to expect from a British production with Elizabeth Spriggs stealing every scene she is in as Mrs. Jennings, Robert Hardy as Sir John Middleton, Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, Oliver Ford Davies as Doctor Harris, and the enchanting young Emilie Francois as Margaret Dashwood (""They always kneel down"").  On the darker side of the ledger we have Greg Wise as the less than honorable John Willoughby, and Imogene Stubbs as Lucy Steele and Harriet Walter as Fanny Dashwood vying for the main villainess role in the proceedings.  No wonder Emma Thompson's performance as Elinor is almost lost in the proceedings, but she is the center around which everything resolves who has to keep it together when everybody around her is losing it (even when she first confesses her broken heart, she ends up consoling Marianne instead of the other way around).

Ang Lee had already proven he could handle a tale of sisters in love when he directed ""Eat Drink Man Woman.""  In ""Sense and Sensibility"" he has the script, the actors and the set design all working in his favor to create a sense of 19th century England.  But there are a few moments when he uses the camera to great advantage; in particular the overhead shot of Marianne on her sick bed achieves a painting like quality and the tracking shot of Mrs. Jennings running down the street bearing the latest gossip.

I first saw this film when visiting England and I was so caught up in the story that I had no idea who was going to end up with who.  Actually, I was sort of rooting for Elinor to end up with Colonel Brandon since they were obviously the two finest members of their respective sexes in the proceedings.  So the ending was as much of a surprise to me as it was to the Dashwoods, which is certainly something to be cherished.  Obviously if you love this film it will lead you to other Austen adaptations (the film versions of ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"" along with the BBC mini-series ""Pride & Prejudice"" immediately leap to mind), but hopefully it will also lead you to the original novels as well.  Finally, Thompson published ""The Sense and Sensibility: Screenplay & Diaries,"" which I would highly recommend after you have done both the film and the novel.",1006646400,9,4983,4.6880733944954125

171080,5,0800141660,"This is the story of three sisters (two of marriageable age) and their mother who find themselves suffering a reversal of fortune.  At the death of their father, their half-brother and his wife turn them out (in the most polite way, of course!) to make their own way on a paltry saving.  The sisters proceed to fall in love and the story is of the trials and tribulations of those relationships, set in late 18th century England.
Sense and Sensibility is normally regarded as one of Austin's weaker efforts, but it's still highly entertaining.  This film is entirely faithful to the original story, yet rearranged and adapted in a fresh and fun way.  Emma Thompson does double-duty as the screenwriter and as the main character, Elinor (the sister with ""sense"").  The cast is impeccably chosen, from Kate Winslet as the ""sensibility"" sister Marianne (no one does spoiled impetuousity better) and Hugh Grant as Elinor's suitor (no one does shy romantic better) to the lesser known actors.  Those who only know Alan Rickman as hammy bad-guys in Die Hard and Robin Hood will be pleasantly surprised by his range of talents.
Ang Lee lends a sure hand in direction, similar to his work in Eat Drink Man Woman.  The movie looks good.  Thompson's screenplay is entirely faithful to the book in spirit, while introducing a great many changes.  Elinor, as played by Thompson, is obviously not 19 years old, Hugh Grant is not ""plain,"" and several characters are dropped completely, such as Lucy Steele's sister.  In addition, the dialogue is heavily rearranged and edited, scenes are added that don't appear in the book, etc.  In spite of this, the film is probably the truest adaptation I have ever seen in a 2-hour studio film.  The new scenes and additional dialogue are generally adapted from Austin's editorial comments, and so are ""true"" to the original story, even if they aren't explicitly in the novel as filmed.
The DVD has a few extras, including an audio commentary and deleted scenes.  Oddly, there are only two deleted scenes included, although many more are mentioned in the commentary as being filmed and then being cut.  I, for one, would like to see the duel between Col. Brandon and Willoughby, but alas, it is not included.  Thus, the DVD is pretty humdrum, except for the fact that it looks very good.  I think Lee's films should always be seen in widescreen, as the setting is important to many of his shots.

Therefore, when my step-uncle suggested that we watch the movie, I was not particularly excited.  When I heard, however, that it featured Alan Rickman, I was mildly interested.  I had heard a lot about him in my previous life (<: as a fan of J.K. Rowling's Professor Snape, and I wanted to see what kind of actor he was.
I was, as you may imagine, unprepared.
Before it was halfway through, I was blown away by not only Rickman's, but also Winslet's and Grant's superb performances.  Kudos also to Thompson for her screenplay, which was, to put it gently, a HUGE improvement over the original.
I think I speak for a great deal of female veiwers when I say that, not only is Rickman more attractive than Wise (who plays Winslet's character's other potential suitor), he is also an absolutely adorable character.  The way he reads that poetry... *sigh*
It is notable that, in the novel, Marianne (Winslet) was NOT carried back from Coombe Magna to the Palmer's estate by Col. Brandon (Rickman).  I think that the way it is portrayed in the movie shows considerable genius on the part of Emma Thompson, seeing as Brandon's rescuing her from Willoughby's (Wise) clutches paralells his physically rescuing her from Coombe Magna.

The normally repressed and sedate Elinor, always choosing her words carefully and weighing them before she speaks, bursts out with a tirade against Marianne that almost draws applause from the viewer.
It's not that we don't like Marianne; on the contrary, she is herself quite loveable. It's just that at last to see Elinor give way to the turmoil she feels inside is a catharsis for everybody. She's had a very hard time of it, too. First, her father died leaving her, Marianne, their younger sister, and mother destitute and dependent upon others' kindnesses. Then she forms an attachment to her sister-in-law's brother Edward (Hugh Grant_, but when it seems certain he will propose, zilch.

And Marianne? Well, she has the unwanted attentions of Captain Brandon (Alan Rickman) to contend with, until she is literally swept off her feet by the romantic Willoughby. THEIR engagement seems a done deal, when suddenly, zilch again!
Jane Austen was a master at presenting a story which appears to have no happy ending, a story where you suddenly realize you're as blind as the heroine about what is REALLY going on.

Unlike other British movies I have seen, I found the dialogue easy to comprehend and the subtle humor very funny. Every aspect of the movie was magnificent. The writing, acting, directing were all superb and you couldn't have asked for a better cast. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet were amazing and perfect in the roles of the two Dashwood sisters. They were surrounded by a magnificent supporting cast, every actor performing his/her role to perfection. By the end of the movie I was bawling and smiling at the same time. The woman beside me thought I was nuts and I had to excuse myself to cry my eyes out in the bathroom. Back home the following week I purchased the movie and have since watched it too many times to count. The movie is firmly situated in my top three favourite movies of all time. It is truely a stunning and amazing movie.",982972800,4,1318,4.495833333333334

An extremely fine cast and beautiful English settings, along with Emma Thompson's beautifully written screenplay make for a fine evening for all hopeless romantics! This is a story of two sisters who lose their dowry due to their father's death and all the money goes to his first son. Elinor's sensibility is contrasted against Marianne's (superbly played by Kate Winslet) lack of sense in pursuit of romance as each girl endures various obstacles pertaining to the objects of their affections. Each sister endures and grows to find the true love and happiness that they've always hoped for. The soundtrack is also an asset to this movie.",981504000,,717,4.933884297520661

Yes, it's the acting;  it's the painstaking detail in the costumes, jewelry, scenery; it's the tight script and poetic pace; it's all of these things, and yet what makes this movie so wonderful is not minutia but evocation.  Whether you identify with the idealism of Winslet's Marianne or the endurance found in Thompson's Elinor, we all know -- intimately -- the range of emotions which this terrific group of artists seem to so effortlessly touch with words and deeds.

That being said, I really feel this adaptation is one any lover of romance can enjoy. The characters are all believable - the older daughter who has to be reasonable and help keep her family going, and the younger, romantic sister who wants to fall in love with a handsome man who quotes poetry to her and takes her on picnics.
The adaptation is not faithful - many items were changed to make the story more accessible - but even purists will be charmed at how well the story plays. Alan Rickman is great as the older suitor who loves Marianne and wishes her the best, even if that means she goes with another man he doubts the worth of.
If you have a DVD player it's even better - the DVD version has several separate audio tracks that let you hear the actor and directors thoughts while watching the movie. You'll be amazed at the kinds of insights you learn!

171106,5,0800141660,"Starring Emma Thompson, who also wrote the screenplay for this 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel, this is a big beautiful sweeping film that transcends the centuries.
Under the very excellent direction of Ang Lee, a Taiwanese native whose career started with Chinese language films such as The Wedding Banquet"" and has since directed ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Ride With the Devil,"" his sense of Britain in the 1790s is excellent.  He manages to convey  every nuance of the manners of that time and keeps the story as fresh to the modern audience as when it was first written.
Basically, it is a story of a formerly wealthy widow who is left in very moderate circumstances and who needs to marry off her two oldest daughters. Emma Thompson is cast as Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters and the most ""sensible"".  Kate Winslet, who later rose to fame in Titanic, is the younger and more impetuous one.  Both are excellent actresses and their performances ring with absolute nuanced perfection.
Hugh Grant is cast as Elinor Dashword's love interest, and Kate Winslet is romanced by both Alan Rickman as the older and serious landowner and Greg Wise as the dashing young man who sweeps her off her feet.  The road to true love, however, is rife with obstacles, and there is tension throughout because the characters rarely say what they mean as the plot twists and turns and keeps the audience on edge. I was totally caught up in the story, feeling the emotions of the characters and actually finding myself weeping at the very satisfying conclusion.
Emma Thompson was nominated for two academy awards for this film -- one for her writing and one for her acting.  She won for her writing the best screenplay based on material from another medium.  Kate Winslet was also nominated for an academy award as best supporting actress.  The movie won the Golden Globe as best motion picture and the list of other awards and nominations are just too numerous to mention.
Don't miss this video!  It is an absolute joy from beginning to end.  I give it my highest recommendation.",974505600,3,2081,4.7555555555555555

Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant are BRILLIANT as well.  Alan Rickman plays the timid Colonel Brandon.  A must see for all romantics who thought all was lost because of rejection by a lover.  This is an amazing film!,973209600,,353,4.783333333333333
171108,5,0800141660,"Economically, this is probably the wisest video purchase I ever made, as every couple of months I will pop this film into the VCR. I never seem to  tire of it.
Perhaps it's a bit odd that I adore this film so much; at  first glance, it seems far removed from my own life. If I ever consider  abject poverty to be living in a grand stone house in the countryside, then  I am a very lucky woman indeed. Social niceties that make demands on my  behavior are more along the lines of filling up everyone's margarita glass  rather than curtseying upon entering a drawing room.
However, the major  themes of the film are timeless indeed. Sometimes, money is still a  deterrent to love and love is still a game. The fact that societal and  familial constraints, not to mention scheming underlings, can keep true  lovers apart is still an atrocity.
Moreover, Jane Austen lamented the  limitations placed upon women in her time and wrote passionately of women  coping within these confines. Elinor quietly laments her inability to  choose a profession while Marianne learns that too passionate a temper does  not benefit a lady. Young Margaret is an extreme example of a young girl  not yet jaded by the desperate urge to marry well. She longs for travel,  her prized possession is her atlas, her eyes sparkle when Colonel Brandon  speaks of the East Indies. It is sad to consider that Margaret will have a  hard time pursing her dreams in a world with few female ship captains.
A  hint: if any women are having difficulty recommending this film to members  of the male persuasion, tell `em Alan Rickman plays a pivotal role. True,  his lovestruck Colonel Brandon is a far cry from the fantastic villains he  portrayed in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Die Hard, but this amazing  actor is still a huge draw. ;)",967593600,5,1804,4.621451104100946

Kate Winslet  gives a masterful performance as young Marianne, a talented and love struck  girl who is almost too romantic for her own good.  You'll love following  her story.  Elenor, played by Emma Thompson, is a little dry at times, but  she gives an excellent performance.  I felt Hugh Grant played a good Henry,  a shy and quiet suitor, but I felt that it could have been a bit more  exciting...at times I felt like his portrayal of the character truly took  away from the scene itself.

171112,5,0800141660,"This would appear to be the sort of production the Academy votes as best picture, and indeed Sense and Sensibility was duly nominated in 1996, but lost out to Braveheart.  I'm not sure why, but my guess is that Sense and  Sensibility lacked something in the minds of the members of the Academy,  call it...dirt.
Everything is a little too pretty, a little too clean and  well behaved in this charming adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel.  Director Ang Lee might have provided some insight into early 19th century  England by showing the poverty and squalor of the London streets instead of  just having the girls step around a little horse manure.  Lee might also  have shown that the servants had it worse than the gentry by expanding the  scene where they are let go by showing just where some of them did go.  Lee's direction hints at a wider world of poverty and real pain, but  rejects having it intrude.  Although the full force of the industrial  revolution and attendant horrors were yet to come, they might have been  presaged so that Austen's world is given perspective for the modern  audience.  Soon the skies of England would be blackened with smoke from  coal and most of its citizens turned into proletarian cogs.
But Austen  knew and/or cared about that not at all, and instead wrote with singular  attention about the gentry and their acquisitive aspirations and genteel  manners, and this is the novel that Emma Thompson captured so well in her  Academy Award winning screenplay.  The fact that the Dashwoods lost their  estate and had to live in a cottage and practice thrift within a budget was  a very real tragedy to Austen, although not to us.  She was obsessed with  the injustice of being a young woman without means living within a society  that allowed upward mobility by women only through marriage.  So she showed  women playing that game to perfection, and winning.
Emma Thompson as the  sensible Elinor Dashwood was flawless, as usual; and Kate Winslet as her  sister, the sensual Marianne who wears her heart on her sleeve, proved once  again that she is a gifted and charismatic actress second to none.  The  supporting cast, especially Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, and Harriet  Walter as Fanny Dashwood, was superb.  The cinematography was gorgeous,  even arresting at times.
Most uncomfortable scene: Marianne being bled.  This reminds us that sometimes one has to overcome both the disease and the  physician.",962496000,4,2456,4.866504854368932
171113,5,0800141660,Just recently I viewed this movie after having seen it years earlier. This time with my entire family. We all truly enjoyed it.  Jane Austins novel is performed extremely well. The casting was superior.  Emma  Thompson's crying scene was moving and utterly believable. Kate Winslet  gives a noteworthy performance. What a wonderful period piece with such  royal passion. Easily a movie that could be viewed many times and still  capture interest.,961459200,,446,5.211267605633803
171114,4,0800141660,"Hats off of Emma Thompson for her wonderful screenplay.  She did a superb job of putting this story together.  Even though she's a little too old for Elinor's nineteen, she played the part very well indeed.  The Dashwoods,  under the recent loss of the father, lose their beloved Norland to the  half-brother, John.  John and his selfish wife, Fanny quickly take over.  While still in residence, the Dashwoods are introduced to Fanny's visiting  brother, Edward.  He is shy, but witty.  Hugh Grant plays the part well.  Edward and Elinor form an attachment, but Fanny does not approve.  Her only  wish is to get the Dashwoods out of her house and separate ther brother  from Miss Dashwood.  Recieving a cottage by Mrs. Dashwood's cousin, the  family depart Norland to take up residence in the more affordable home,  surrounded by beautiful countryside and sea side.  Elinor we know is  saddened, but she doesn't show it.  Their landlord, Middleton and his  mother-in-law Mrs. Jennings are overly friendly.  Mrs. Jennings is an  annoying busy body who would be better off learning to mind her own  business.  Sometimes I just wanted to slap her and tell her to shut up!  The best thing to come out of the too-friendly landlord is that the  Dashwoods become aquainted with Colonel Brandon.  Marianne's infatutation  with Willoughby, after he rescues her and carries her home after a tumble  developes into an intense love.  Willoughby  appears to feel the same, but  I got the impression while watching that he didn't care for Marianne as  much as he acted.  Willoughby receives some news and must away, in essence  deserting Marianne.  Her hurt at this terrible loss is touching.  And it  takes her a long time to get over it.  I won't go on and summarize ALL of  the events.  Just watch it yourself.  And forget about Elinor and Edward.  Theirs is a nice little story, but I was far more moved by the storyline  involving Marianne and Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman, playing the Colonel  to perfection).  His love for her is amazing.  He is so patient, unselfish,  quietly loving her as she herself is indifferent to him.  Though not as  dashingly handsome as Willoughby, he has more character and is by far the  better man.  I found him much more likeable.  I loved the moment at  Marianne's sickbed when after Colonel Brandon fetches Mrs. Dashwood,  Marianne says ""thank you"" to him. Anyone who watches this movie  will guess the outcome.  Jane Austen was all about happy endings and having  the right couples get together.  Love conquers all, it's said, and it  certainly does is this film.  And since ""Marianne could never love by  halves"", I was very happy with the ending. This is a must see for  anyone in the mood for a romantic film, and especially for Jane Austen  fans.",960336000,2,2779,4.776595744680851
171115,4,0800141660,"Don't miss this movie! It's a brilliant adaptation of the Jane Austen classic and simply lovely to watch. Emma Thompson did an excellent job on the screenplay, and deservedly won an Oscar for her efforts.
I agree that  in the age department, Emma Thompson was not suited to carry the role of  Elinor Dashwood (who's supposed to be only 19). However, Ms Thompson's  acting was brilliant and flawless, and as the story unfolds and draws you  in, you hardly remember to notice or care about the age factor anymore. I  thought Emma Thompson's portrayal of Elinor was not unlike the character of  Margaret Schlegel (which she played in ""Howards End"") who's also  a kind gentlewoman who loves too much and suffers inwardly.
As a story,  ""Sense and Sensibility"" (S&S) has a far more serious premise  compared to 2 other Austen works ie. ""Emma"" and ""Mansfield  Park"". Perhaps this partly explains why S&S is the more  highly-acclaimed movie (it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars)  compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Emma"" and Frances O'Connor's  ""Manfield Park"". In S&S, there are very sad scenes involving  unrequited love, quiet suffering (Elinor's and Col. Brandon's) and long  illness (Marianne's). Many scenes will make you reach for that box of  tissues eg. when the always calm-and-collected Elinor burst into  uncontrollable tears the moment she hears the (happy) truth concerning  Edward Ferrar's situation, and when Marianne (still lying ill in her bed)  thanks Col. Brandon softly (for all his help and kindness).
I also admire  Alan Rickman's acting. He is perfect as Col. Brandon, a very good man whose  love for Marianne is (sadly) unrequited. His love is of the best kind - he  doesn't court with (empty) flowery words, instead he displays so much care,  concern, lovingness and tenderness by his every look towards Marianne and  by his every action to make her well and happy. I was nicely surprised that  in the movie, Col. Brandon looks more dashing and handsome than John  Willoughby (to me anyway).
Kate Winslet's ""Marianne"" is  adorable as well. She sings beautifully and has such grace and beauty that  it's no wonder men fell in love with her at first sight.
I shall not give  away the ending, of course. But for the benefit of any viewer who have not  read the novel but wish for a better and more satisfying understanding of  the final scene involving Marianne, just remember the following sentence  which I quote from the novel:
""Marianne could never love by  halves.""",958608000,36,2493,4.915865384615385
171116,4,0800141660,"Now if you're going to have man-trouble, what better kind than that of the bright and beauteous Dashwood sisters in Sense and Sensibility. The guys are rich, their estates are all thriving, and there's no pressure to have  sex until after marriage.
But contrary to what you might thinks, these  poor young debs are in a bind. Dad has died and left his vast holdings to  his son John. And although the womens' half-brother promises to take-care  of the Dashwoods, his snooty wife Fanny is not the most generous of women.  To make ends meet, the family, complete with mum and littlest sibling,  moves to a relative's small cottage.
Elinor (Emma Thompson) is the more  rational of the sisters but in time finds herself smitten with Fanny's  brother Edward, played with little wit and less panache by  Hugh Grant.  Marianne (Kate Winslet), never one to hide her emotions, promptly falls in  lust with Willoughby (Greg Wise). Will the girls' love be requited?  Eventually. In one way or another, all the character's in Jane Austen's  novels get what's coming. But it's not the destination but the journey that  brings such delight.
Emma Thompson's script is a frolic. It refuses to  take itself too seriously and is never self-conscious like so many modern  tales of romance.",958089600,4,1270,4.864485981308412

This is a true 'classic'.  Watch this film to lift your  spirits.  Although impossibly romantic, the story of two sisters in their  pursuit of love offers much hope to a 'dumpee' - they find love in the end  after all the hardship.  The basic message - that 'everything will be OK in  the end' - is as important today as it was all those years ago.  More  important: this movie inspires hope, whilst restoring faith in life.  The  acting is superb accross the entire cast, and the age difference between  the two sisters is perfectly apt - emphasising vividly the differences  between sense and sensibility.  However, I recommend multiple viewings to  fully appreciate the multi-layered depths of the leading, Academy Award  nominated performances from Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.  The finely  executed, educated script is divine.  No Oscar-winning script has ever been  so polished or deserved before or since.  All this brought together by the  detail oriented direction by Ang Lee - who's outstanding work never diverts  attention from the story or characters.  Forget Braveheart - this was the  more truthful, moving and funny cinematic tour de force of 1995 - truly  deserving of the Best Picture Academy Award nomination - for excellence in  film - it should have won.",957744000,6,1437,4.949367088607595

Having said that, however, Thompson does  do a good job as the sensible, pragmatic eldest sister who has to appoint  herself head of the family when her father dies and their mean, snobby  sister-in-law sees to it that they are left in poverty.
Everyone here is  well-cast from dashing young good-for-nothing Willoughby (Greg Wise) who  casts a spell on impressionable young Marianne (Kate Winslet) to the gentle  and sensitive Colonel  Brandon whose faithful love for the said young lady  appears unrequited.

I was so drawn into this story by all the characters  that I forgot I was sitting on my couch watching a screen. The next to last  scene is so beautiful-I dare you not to cry.,947721600,2,341,4.230769230769231
171128,5,0800141660,"My favourite movie.  So romantic and so funny, often at the very same moment.  I love the contrast between the formal manners - Hugh Grant in his high collar bowing stiffly to the curtseying ladies - and the blazing  passions below the surface.  Emma Thompson's script brings Jane Austen to  life for a modern audience without ever seeming to step out of period - a  difficult thing to do, witness most other period dramas on film.
Ang  Lee's direction draws the best out of a wonderful cast, and the screen is  filled with glorious visual images.  The silent and motionless shot of the  formal garden in early morning sunshine, seen through the window after a  night of crisis, has an exquisite beauty that seems almost Chinese...  And  in the scene where Elinor is left to drink a cup of tea on the stairs with  the rest of the family sobbing in their rooms, the way that the camera  pulls back and looks down on the gleaming disk of the tea's surface is the  work of a master.  Then the images of the men on horseback with cloaks  swirling - Willoughby's first appearance, and the scene where Colonel  Brandon gallops away between the trees... so romantic!
The relationship  between the two sisters is very moving, and beautifully played, as in the  scene on the hillside - 'There I fell, and there I first saw Willoughby...'  OK, so Emma Thompson is about 20 years too old for Elinor, but where are  you going to get a teenage actress who could give such a great performance?  And Kate Winslet is perfect and enchanting as Marianne.  Hugh Grant and  Alan Rickman, and all of the cast down to the minor characters are superb  too.
A great movie, and a joyous and deeply satisfying experience.",945302400,8,1695,4.5633333333333335
171129,5,0800141660,"This movie is actually the flick that turned me on to ""British"" period films.  Emma and Kate are magnificient in their roles as the Dashwood sisters.  (Note Winslett's beautiful singing voice!)  The movie is  funny, yet sad, but resultingly satisfying.  I highly recommend this film  if you enjoy watching ""chick flicks"" with twists!",942969600,,333,5.188679245283019
171130,5,0800141660,"I wasn't going to buy this DVD. I already have the film on VHS normal and VHS widescreen. Now I have all 3 formats.
The commentary track by Emma Thompson and Lindsay Doran is the most entertaining I've heard on any DVD.  The two of them obviously enjoyed making the film and they have lots of  little stories to tell about it. Their comments fill in a lot of questions  I was left with after reading Emma Thompson's published screenplay.
I was  curious to see the infamous kissing scene. I see why it was left out, but  it's nice to have finally seen it. Mix it with brief cuts that are in the  trailers and not in the film, and there's some interesting extra material.  But of course films are best if they leave you wanting more.
The only  thing I'd change about this movie, if I could, would have been to have the  sisters both be teenagers. Emma Thompson did a great job as a  twentysomething older sister, but Elinor's character really should have  been an older, serious teen against Marianne's impulsive teen.  Pronouncements by Emma's Elinor carry too much conviction because she's  just those few years older. The ""I wish Marianne had a better  acquaitance with the ways of the world"" exchange with Col. Brandon has  a very different flavor if it comes from, say, a nineteen-year-old.",938131200,29,1293,4.585152838427947
171131,5,0800141660,"This movie is one of the best! It is in the rankings with ""Elizabeth"" and ""Shakespere in Love.""  This is my favorite time period for movies.  The part that Kate Winslet plays is her  best. A younger sister who is looking for true love in all the wrong  places.  She ends up relizing  true love is right under her nose. This is a  family movie or a movies for couples. It is guarenteed to satisfy the  viewer!",937094400,,408,4.207792207792208

171133,5,0800141660,"To say the film is beautifully shot is woefully understating the obvious.  But, unlike many costume flicks, the visuals don't seem fussy or educational.  You realize you are in beautiful places without being forced  that down your throat.
Emma Thompson's performance as the older Dashwood  is the crux of the film.  In the dark moments of the film, she is hopeful.  In the light moments, she seems wary.  As someone who has sense should be  played.  But, the severity of their situation and her romantic situation is  also poignantly played by Emma Thompson.  Kate Winslet is good too, and  their chemistry as sisters is perfect.  You really believe they were.  What  you remember about the movie is not the romance, but the shared struggles  of these two sisters (the littlest one merely is comic foil.)  As close to  a Austen hankie as you're gonna get!",926294400,,855,4.779310344827586

171135,3,0800141660,"I was a little disappointed with director Ang Lee's ""American debut.""  All told, S&S was very well-constructed but a bit fluffy.
The costuming was amazing, though, and the cinematography was, as with  all of Lee's films, impeccable.
Thompson's best work, IMHO, is ""The  Remains of the Day.""
For those curious about this phenomenal  Taiwanese film maker, I suggest ""Tui Shou"" (""Pushing  Hands"" in English) or ""The Wedding Banquet.""",924825600,2,430,5.264705882352941

The cinematography is spectacular, and the character development  is fabulous.  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet contribute so much to this  film.

171139,5,0800141660,"This adaptation of the Jane Austen Classic has proven itself worthy of her name. The screenplay, written by Emma Thompson, pays close attention to the heart of Jane Austen. The joys coupled with the many sorrows of these girls  carry the viewers along on a heart-felt journey that captures the soul. The  strength of Elinor Dashwood is something I, to this day, cannot apprehend.  It is so moving, so challenging, the way she carries the burdens of  everyone in her household upon her shoulders, to the point of  forgetting(rather, neglecting) her own very pressing needs. Emma Thompson  is brilliant and makes this movie a laudable classic fit to be applauded  for generations to come.",918259200,,686,4.964912280701754
