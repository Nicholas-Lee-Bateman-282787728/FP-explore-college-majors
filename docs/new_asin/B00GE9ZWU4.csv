8622447,4,B00GE9ZWU4,"The film was far more political (and anti-Zionist or should I say anti-Israeli, I'm not sure) than I expected from a quick read of the jacket.  It sounded almost like a somewhat idyllic melting-pot of different ethnic groups in what is mostly an extremely polarized nation and territories.  But it's largely a presentation,by native Palestinians in Akka, of what it is like living under Jewish domination and being treated as second-class citizens.  There's some sea-diving, mostly toward the end, but that seemed almost an after-thought.  For Israelis or Americans who basically support Israel no matter what, it seems a good film to watch to see the ugly side of Israeli policies; policies which haven't gotten any better in the past 40 years and [like much of the rest of the modern world] will eventually be forced to change, or prove ultimately self-destructive.  A fairly sobering film to watch, although the passions are restrained in the narrations.",1412380800,,957,5.108974358974359
8622448,5,B00GE9ZWU4,"Excellent video about Acre, the town I grew up in and left with my family in 1948. Like the majority of the then Palestinian inhabitants of Palestine, we escaped from the advancing Israeli forces who, according to Ilan Pappe and  other Israeli historians, were able to occupy hundreds of Palestinian villages and urban centers, expel all inhabitants and demolish their homes in preparation for building new residences for incoming Jewish immigrants. Pappe mentions many massacres committed by Israeli forces to speed up this process. Most of this was accomplished before the impending departure of British forces who ruled the country and hence had the responsibility of defending inhabitants under their rule, and  before the arrival of any of troops from Arab countries.  I remember when I sat with a friend of mine on  top of the famous wall of Acre, looking across the Bay of Acre, watching British boats loading Palestinians being expelled from Haifa (my birth place) and transporting them to Acre.",1408752000,,1003,5.134969325153374
8622449,5,B00GE9ZWU4,Very well done. The film does a masterful job of taking the viewer deep into a culture that we normally only see through bits and scraps on CNN.,1408233600,2,144,4.178571428571429
8622450,5,B00GE9ZWU4,"Compelling, poignant film about displacement, and what its like to have your home taken away even while you're still living in it. The politics are complex and will probably provoke some viewers, particularly Zionists, but this story presents a point of view thats not often heard and reminds us that underneath all the politics are average human beings just trying to live with dignity in the present and find hope for the future. Well told, well made, and with a beautiful soundtrack. Very worth watching.",1395792000,2,507,4.976470588235294
8622451,5,B00GE9ZWU4,"This film is a fascinating combination of great footage (and even greater editing!) of cliff divers and interviews about the historical and current situation in the ancient city of Akka (Acre) in present-day Israel.  The story is told by myriad citizens of the town who have watched Israelis try to buy property in order to turn the town into a high-end international tourist trap, all the while ignoring the rich Palestinian heritage of the town.  The story is riveting and shocking.  The people are courageous and bold.  The cliff divers are insane!  Watch this film!!",1391126400,3,570,4.957894736842105
