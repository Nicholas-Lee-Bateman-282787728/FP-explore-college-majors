People who are sensitive to the nuances of their performing style will appreciate this.

2688897,1,B000KF0GS6,"This movie is virtually a complete copy of Rock Around the Clock. It looked ordinary, the songs were quite boring- apart from the title track.

Did not really enjoy any of it - acting was poor - songs were poor - being

2688898,3,B000KF0GS6,"I found Twist Around The Clock to be a mediocre film. The story is an exact copy of Rock around the clock. The supporting acts, again mediocre. The star is really Chubby Checker, whose performance of The Twist especially in the finale is awesome and I will emulate some of his actions the next time I Twist at a party! The same for ""Don't knock the Twist"", again Chubby is most entertaining. They fail to capture the brilliance of ""Rock around the clock"" where every act is a winner.",1172016000,,483,4.438202247191011
2688899,3,B000KF0GS6,"There's some good songs but the dancing is embarrassing compared with the lindy hop in ""Don't Knock The Rock""/""Rock Around The Clock"" dvd's.  Compare the dancing in ""The Fly"" number with the dancing in ""Rip It Up"" and you'll see what I mean.

To be fair, this set does have its moments; e.g., Dee Dee Sharp appears with Chubby Checker to sing ""Slow Twistin'"".",1170720000,,359,4.59375
2688900,1,B000KF0GS6,"""Twist Around the Clock"" (1961) was hurriedly made to capitalize on the new dance craze, the Twist. Columbia was in such a hurry to cash in that producer Sam Katzman simply took the script of the 1956 smash hit ""Rock Around the Clock"" and refilmed it almost verbatim. Most of the storyline and many entire dialogue sequences are lifted bodily from the older film. If you know ""Rock Around the Clock,"" you'll find yourself reciting ""Twist Around the Clock.""

""Twist Around the Clock"" is pretty low-voltage, despite guest-star turns by Dion (who lip-synchs ""Runaround Sue,"" ""The Wanderer,"" and ""The Majestic""), The Marcels (not shown to best advantage with a mediocre rendition of ""Merry Twist-mas""), Vicki Spencer (a Connie Francis wanna-be), and top-billed Twistmaster Chubby Checker. Chubby only has a few lines of dialogue but he is quite ingratiating in his limited role; his fans will be disappointed that he doesn't show up until the middle of the movie, and he doesn't sing his record hits ""The Twist"" or ""Let's Twist Again."" The plotline is handled by uninspired unknowns; John Cronin and Mary Mitchell do not distinguish themselves as the romantic leads, although Alvy Moore of ""Green Acres"" gets a chuckle or two in a deadpan comedy-relief role.

If you have to choose between the ""Twist Around the Clock"" and ""Rock Around the Clock"" DVDs, ""Rock Around the Clock"" is easily your better bet. ""Twist Around the Clock"" fares badly on all counts: the music is monotonous (not one of the ""twist"" numbers is memorable), the story portions between numbers are leaden, and the predictability of the whole enterprise will have you reaching for the fast-forward button. All this has going for it is an archaeological value: curious viewers can observe the Twist phenomenon in its original context, and film buffs can see for themselves just how much was stolen from an older and better movie.",1170115200,13,1891,5.0

2688909,5,B000KF0GS6,"Old rock & roll movies like this are always utterly predictable: you'll have record promoters pushing the latest hot new act, usually someone very sincere and good; and old farts totally offended by all of the rowdiness and disrepute and hip-shaking of the acts and the dancers; and at the very end, all is reconciled, everyone's happy, and rock and roll will never die (and it won't, ever.)  So knowing all that, are these movies still great? Yes - because the music is!  And even when the music is silly, and the acting bad, it still makes you happy. And that's what really matters, right?",1394236800,,591,4.619047619047619
2688910,5,B000KF0GS6,"Rock and Roll movies all seem to have the same silly stories, but they don't take up much time and are simply a brief bridge between the various acts.  Teens only went to these movies to see the singers or band and didn't care about the story.  Most of the ""twist"" songs all sound alike, and the twist doesn't involve any dancing  skill like the jitterbug or swing dancing, but it's fun and nostalgic to see these now much older people (and some dead) in their youthful days.  I gave the set a five-star rating because Dion is in one of the films.",1391558400,,547,4.281553398058253

2688922,3,B000KF0GS6,"What's glaringly odd about ""Twist Around The Clock"" is the plot...where a group of small-town white kids have invented a new dance called The Twist.  While I understand the movie was marketed to white audiences in 1961, it's bizarre how, midway through the flick, the REAL source of The Twist: Chubby Checker, is given a minor role to play, performing two numbers.  They ""rightfully"" refer to Chubby as ""the King of the twist,"" but according to the plot, it was those small-town white kids that invented it!  So (in the internal logic of the script) how could Chubby have even KNOWN about the twist?  Strrrrrange!
Still, the movie is oddly entertaining, in a twisted sort of way.  Ha ha.",1388448000,,687,4.739495798319328
2688923,5,B000KF0GS6,Quality was great. Love watching the performers go through the songs albeit lip sinc. Storyline although very predictable adds to the enjoyment of what happened in that era. A great way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon.,1375920000,2,235,4.7560975609756095

2688927,5,B000KF0GS6,"The transfer is crisp and clear. These classic predecessors of music videos have been restored to pristine condition and are a joy to watch. You'll get to see and hear many classic rock 'n roll groups of the late 1950's and the early 1960's in beautiful black and white!

Best of all, it's a double feature, just like the days of the drive-in theaters! Although the plots are a bit corny in these movies, the music  is fantastic to listen to--I play these movies on mainly for the soundtrack. Amazon had this DVD on sale so I got it for only $7.49!!! What a steal!!

I recommend these films for all baby boomers and for anybody who loves music from the 1950's and 1960's, or for those people who love cheesy drive-in flicks. As a little kid, I remember doing the Twist to Chubby Checker with my babysitter. These films bring back great memories!",1316044800,5,845,4.474025974025974

2688929,4,B000KF0GS6,"This is a review for the double featured DVD of DON'T
KNOCK THE TWIST and TWIST AROUND THE CLOCK.

There was a flurry of Twist movies that came out around 1961
attempting to capitolize on the enormous dance craze that swept and
reswept the country in 1960 and 1961.  The Twist was so pervasive
it was even danced at White House parties, make thet Camelot
White House parties.

So here are two of the movies that without trying to be are something
like time capsules of what you might call ""the Twist Era.""  and
luckily both of them feature the great popularizer of the song and dance,
Chubby Checker who was a very good performer.

IN the first one, TWIST AROUND THE CLOCK the story, just the same as
1956's ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK, has two rock'n roll veterans accidently
stumbling on a new dance and music at a small town dance and immediatly
hit on the idea of importing it all to the big town for a sure fire success.

That is pretty much what happens but there are a few complications along
the way. In the meantime we get to see Chubby Checker perform his megahit,
""The Twist,"" among other songs and Dion performs ""Runaround Sue"" as well
as ""The Wanderer."" And The Marcells perform their holiday attempt,
""Merry Twistmas.""

There is one thing that's a little bothersome in TWIST AROUND THE CLOCK.
Some of the characters take pains to put down rock'n roll and seem to be
pointing to the twist and its music as something particularly different.
But myself and everyone I knew all considered the Twist to be rock ""n roll
and the records were definitely rock records . In fact, at parties, we twisted to
practically every rock 'n roll record available, it was all the same
so far as we were concerned.

In DON'T KNOCK THE TWIST we again have a movie a little like
DON'T KNOCK THE ROCK but again, instead of Bill Haley and the Comets we
have a fine performance by a much more confident and assured Chubby Checker.
By this time Mr. Checker was Twistmaster General of the United States
and he wore the crown with grace and dignity.

Also in the musical cast are rock royality, The Duke of Earl, Gene Chandler,
MOR popster Vic Dana, The Dovells and the finely voiced hitmaker, Linda Scott.
Of course Gene Chandler had many R&B hits besides his Top Ten smash, Vic Dana
was a staple of mor radio and Linda Scott recorded ""A Thousand Stars"" and
""Happy Birthday Blues,"" two early rock/pop classics.

In DON'T KNOCK THE TWIST a small tv network wants to have a summer twist spectacular
but they have to hurry and beat the big time network before they sign
all the popular acts.  But Chubby Checker comes to the rescue and the coast to coast
Twist Spectacular is on the air as ascheduled.  In the meantime we get to see
performances by all of the above artists and maybe do a little unsupervised twistin'
at home, on our own.
So in the end everything is cool.

These two films are a lot of fun and as I said before, early sixties time capsules.
