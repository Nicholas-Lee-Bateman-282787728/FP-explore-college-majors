8356751,4,B0028RXZI2,"This is an utterly charming Army training video from the 1960's, starring the Women's Army Corps at Fort McClellan, AL, the home of the Corps from 1957-1978.  It follows a private from enlistment through permanent party status and gives advice on grooming, posture, makeup, eating and exercise, and more.  A big highlight of the film for me was the gratuitous view of marching ditties, which I hope the US Army Women's Museum is documenting and preserving.

Though the sound disappears a little over halfway through the film, it's still worth watching, and I hope that the National Archives finds the reels that have the missing sound and add it to the film later.  If they do, I will definitely buy it.",1346803200,,703,4.785123966942149
