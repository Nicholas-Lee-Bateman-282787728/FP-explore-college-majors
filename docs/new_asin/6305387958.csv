7888290,5,6305387958,"I saw this sweet little movie when I was a senior in high school. I knew who Marlo was because I had a huge crush on her because of ""That Girl"".
M*A*S*H hadn't started yet, so I was, like, Alan Who? In 1972, everybody knew who Alan Alda was, but in 1970, I'd never heard of him.
The story is basically about an unwed mother who is befriended by filmmaker Alda because his character wants very badly NOT to be drafted into the Vietnam war. He hopes to avoid the Army. This is not ""Fast and Furious"". There are no fast cars , flaming car crashes, or automotive stunts. It's just a very sweet love story. I highly recommend this film. Both Thomas and Alda acquit themselves very well in this movie. I loved it!",1430611200,,707,4.2444444444444445

Actually, I couldn't really believe I could do this online, so thank you.

Best regards

7888292,5,6305387958,Marlo Thomas and Alan Alda are great in this movie. Loved the teeth scene between Jenny's father and Alan Alda. Filmed while That Girl was still on the air and prior to Alda's MASH TV run.,1425168000,,188,4.25
7888293,5,6305387958,"Alan Alda plays a draft dodger who marries pregnant Jenny (Marlo Thomas) to avoid being drafted.  Unfortunately he still seems to be more interested in his former friends and party lifestyle than in his new bride.  Very funny in places, especially when he meets Jenny's parents.  Jenny's father is a dentist and shows off his collection of teeth, which is extremely funny.  It's very dry humor.  Another great moment is when Jenny, feeling very alone and deserted by her new husband who is partying, goes to a bar.  In the bar she meets a geeky creep (a plumbing salesman) who is in town on a business trip and is looking for some company.  It's a great scene with the creep doing most of the talking and Jenny just listening.  The music in the movie is great; I believe Nilsson sings the title song. Too bad they never did a soundtrack album of this.  Charming period piece that never disappoints.  It's a light weight romance, which is not everyone's cup of tea.",1131062400,6,964,4.584795321637427
