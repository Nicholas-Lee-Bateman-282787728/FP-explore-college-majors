645236,5,6303433766,"Saw this disturbing yet wildly emotional, imaginative and engrossing 1994 film back in the 90's, and until recently, I never thought I could bear to watch it again due to the vile subject matter of matricide.  It's amazingly well-done and the two young leads are incredible actresses.  It's directed by Peter Jackson who would go on to do Lord of the Rings.  Really.  It's one of the better F/F films in our genre out there-- I can't stress this enough.

This is based on a true-crime story which goes down in New Zealand in 1954.  It follows the obsessively needy and close friendship of teenager Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) and her best friend Pauline Rieper/Parker (Melanie Lynskey) who brutally murder Pauline's mother when she tries to keep them apart.

The girls are seemingly opposites. Juliet is the beautiful and charming daughter of a brilliant physicist/university rector and an attractive mother who does social work.  Pauline is the angry daughter of a fishmonger and a mother who runs a boarding house out of their home.  The girls initially bond in school via their shared rebellious natures and the health issues that set them apart from others.  Soon enough, their vivid imaginations and writing pursuits isolate them into their own private world.

Having read a bit of the case outside of what this movie covers, the girls are convicted and serve less than 6 yrs in separate prisons... then are given new identities and passports upon their release.  Pauline would go on to become an anonymous recluse as Hilary Nathan, but Juliet Hulme would go on to become Anne Perry... international bestselling author of crime fiction!

Bizarre and fascinating story.  I'm glad I decided to see it again... it's as good as ever.  Loved revisiting such a young and talented Kate Winslet!!!  Recommended.",1482278400,2,1808,4.956810631229236

645241,5,6303433766,"Peter Jackson, famous for lending his skills on films like The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies, ended up making an amazing masterpiece with this gem during the 90s!

A notorious tale of a schoolgirl's friendship that ended in murder, this is the story that rocked Christchurch, New Zealand over 50 years ago. This Peter Jackson film is what started Kate Winslet's career as she played Juliet Hulme, a girl who developed a strong bond with fellow classmate, Pauline Rieper, portrayed by Melanie Lynskey.

As Juliet and Pauline's friendship soared, we see the events that threatened to end a relationship their parents viewed as ""unhealty"" and obsessive. When confronted at the idea of separation, the two girls acted on a darker fantasy; the end result leading to a woman's homicide and becoming the catalyst that sealed their separation once and for all. Peter Jackson did a remarkable job on Heavenly Creatures when it came to bringing the girls' fantasies to the big screen and detailing the events that lead to their friendship to the actual murder!",1469664000,,1059,4.977401129943503

I really thought that these were 2 girls who were so totally involved with each other in their fantasy worlds that the move to sex would not be surprising. Someone said that Juliet is an author and Pauline a teacher in riding school but does anyone know whether they pursued lesbian relationships or any relationships after leaving prison. I can see why this got Peter Jackson the offer to direct The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Not recommended for children but I'd recommend it for anyone else.,1468713600,,601,4.574074074074074

645284,5,6303433766,"1994 saw the release of Peter Jackson's international hit Heavenly Creatures, which would more famously pave the way to his directing the now fantasy staple Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Starring Kate Winslet in her pre-Titanic stardom and Melanie Lynskey in their screen debuts, it would go onto great acclaim, Academy Award nominations, and the outing of British mystery writer Anne Perry as one of the girls who committed this horrible act.

In Jackson's native New Zealand in 1954, two teenage girls were suddenly at the center of a whirlwind press drama.  A fourteen year old working class girl named Pauline Parker (Lynskey) befriends the more affluent, fifteen year old Juliet Hume (Winslet) when Hume's father moves to her hometown of Christchurch as a college professor.  They bond over their childhood diseases and hospital isolation time, and become immediate friends.  The two begin to write and create adventure and mystery stories together, hoping to someday publish them and make them into movies.  They create this wonderful fantasy world together which they call The Fourth World and know that someday they will be in that world.  While Hume's life is peaceful and content, Parker's relationship with her mother is hostile and her home life is becoming more troubled.  The two develop an intense friendship, one that is questionable and of great concern to both of their parents.  When Hume's parents separate and her father announces that soon they will be moving to South Africa and eventually back to her native England, the girls are nearly hysterical that they will be separated.  The two devise a plan to remain together, determining that the only way they can be together is if they kill Parker's mother.  Sure enough, they do just that while on a nature walk in the woods, beating her to death with a brick in a stocking that Parker brought concealed in her purse.

What is so fascinating about this movie is the fact that two teenage girls, both from stable backgrounds, would conspire to do such a crime and what their mindset was at the time.  Excerpts from their journals quoted in the movie are horrifying of the joy they are about to experience when at last they carry out the act.  One wrote the night before the murder that she felt like a child on Christmas Eve with such eager anticipation.  When they actually commit the act, however, they are in for a horrifying experience.  There is also the question of whether or not it was a homosexual relationship.  While it is shown as being that in the movie, the real life people would later say that it wasn't that way.  Their relationship was certainly unhealthy and obsessive, each was on the edge of desperation and they feared separation anxiety.  After they were tried and found guilty, each were sentenced to prison time.  Their trials were much sensationalized as their being two evil, self centered, psychotic beings who took such joy in Parker's mother's death, but we are left thinking that they truly were not evil, they were so rapt up in this fantasy world they had created to see what it would truly be until they did it.  Both served their time in prison for five years.  After their release, Hume would leave New Zealand and currently resides in her native England.  Parker remained in New Zealand for many years under close observation, and also today lives in Scotland where she has been running a riding school.  Upon the movie's release in 1994, it was publicly revealed that England's acclaimed mystery writer, Anne Perry, was in face, Juliet Hume.  The movie ends with the declaration that one of the conditions of their release was that the two never meet again.  This has since been declared something put into the movie to create drama, there was no formal legal order that they were never to see or speak to each other again, but it is believed that the two never did have contact with each other again after they were released from prison.  Anne Perry (a.k.a. Juliet Hume) has given a few public statements since the movie's release denying that their relationship was gay, and telling her reasons why she did what she did.  She and Parker were friends, and she believed that if they did not do what they did, Parker was going to commit suicide.  It was a terrible thing that she did, she does not deny this.  But what would we say to the friends from the past where we did or said terrible things to them or about them?  There really is nothing to say to them anymore.  Time goes on, you both change, you're both different people.  You really don't have anything to say to each other, except that you wish them well and that you forgave them.  Life goes on.",1465430400,,4664,4.731435643564357

645289,5,6303433766,"This is a chilling portrayal of two young girls obsessive relationship and their misguided need for fantasy to escape the suppression of their parents and 1950s homophobic society.

Brilliant acting and great use of early VFX, personally I do not find it a negative protrayal of their relationship, I think it is very well done and still invokes a sense of empathy for their characters and an understanding of their need to escape, making the finale so much more disturbing. Both lead actresses are brilliant and the supporting cast superb and convincing in each of their roles. The NZ mother's character is so real and conflicted, the opening and final scenes are harrowing because it depicts death and pain in all its true horror not just as a blow them away type of murder act.
Be prepared to be disturbed, but this is one film where Peter Jackson used VFX to its most compelling and pyschological best, not just for the dazzling effects as in every fantasy film he did that followed. This is by far one of his best films, if not the best!",1448409600,4,1042,4.632432432432433

Given the seriousness of the situation of Juliet's abandonment issues and other contributing factors of her mental health, I do not think a true picture of why what caused the murder was depicted, nor was any of the rest of Juliet's life included.

Remains an eerie feeling from the thought that two young girls for his own selfish plans, they had to kill his own mother. They dreamed of a Paradise on earth, and what happened? The eventually they broke own life forever. We should thank the Director Peter Jackson and the two performers of the main roles for the perfect embodiment of this dramatic story.

645369,5,6303433766,"This is an absolutely mesmerizing film about 2 adolescent girls, troubled in their own ways, but together a violent mix of fantasy worlds and murder.  What is unique about the film is the way you enter the minds of the girls, actually share their visions and hopes.  It is so vivid and fresh that I felt genuinely frightened for them.  On their own, would they have developed such savage personas?  Or would they have remained somewhat strange, alienated perhaps, but eventually ready to enter a normal life?  It is weird and ultimately unfathomable, but completely believable.

Of course, a great treat of the movie is Kate Winslet debut:  she looks rather plain and dorky, barely a teenager, who would strip off her clothes and run nearly naked in the woods, eventually turning into a delusional murderess.  I was also unaware that Peter Jackson directed the film, one of his early serious efforts.

Recommended with enthusiasm.  I have never seen anything like it.",1431216000,,967,4.91358024691358
645370,5,6303433766,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this story - the performances and the special effects.

True story of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, who become friends because of their inability to participate in physical activity.  Pauline likes Juliette's drawing, and though Pauline is at first awed at being beautiful Juliette's friend, it is clear that Juliet needs Pauline more.  They want to be together, want to continue forever as friends, and they commit a terrible crime together.

Both Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey give astounding performances.  They give themselves to their roles absolutely, and you know reason will not dissuade them.  They are seemingly dissimilar, both in physical appearance and background, and though Juiet/Kate Winslet is supposed to be the more privileged, it is she who is jealous that Pauline/Melanie Lynskey may have a lover.

This is a fascinating story, and there are many fascinating details.  Watching this film, I was impressed with Peter Jackson's subtlety.  It is not a salacious affair; it is not thrilling and tawdry, but something deeper, richer, and far more poignant.  I like that his focus was on the friendship, and not on the murder.

You hear Pauline's voice.  Taken direct from her diaries.  Initially, she seems less certain, and her reasoning is completely different, but she changes.  She becomes cold.  As times passes, it is Juliette who is terrified.  At the end, the reasoning has lost all reason, and has become an in itself.

The murder is particularly vicious.  It was difficult to watch.  Not just to see poor Honora Parker's demise, but to see how far the girls had sunk - what terrible thing they were doing to their lives.  It was terrible to see - and even to hear, and Honora Parker/Sarah Peirse's yelps pierce the heart.

Love this film.",1430092800,,1808,4.96

HEAVENLY CREATURES: A text prolog informs us that in Christchurch, New Zealand, during 1953 and 1954, Pauline Yvonne Parker kept diaries recording her friendship with Juliet Marion Hulme. This is their story. Pauline (Lynskey) is sullen and snide; a dumpy, frumpy, scowling toad of a 14-year-old. Then Juliet (Winslet)bright, beautiful, worldly-wise; sunny, smarmy and superioris transferred to her school. Unlikely friends, yes; but they have much in common: high intelligence, ages spent in hospitals, an outsider attitude, contempt for convention. And both yearn for escape: Juliet to a world of art and beauty; Paul from this dull, mundane existence.

They become inseparable friends, creating their own world of romantic fantasy. We have decided how sad it is for other people, Paul writes, that they cannot appreciate our genius. But their life together turns sour when their parents question their unwholesome relationship. Threatened with separation, their world collapses. Paul believes her Mum is the main obstacle in their path. But if she were out of the picture...

Discussion: Its the obsessive intensity of the girls friendship that worries the parents; the girls motivation also hinges on family dynamics, but ironically so. Juliets parents are too intellectual to care for her or about her, or to attend her fears of abandonment, while Pauline, the product of a family that actually loves her despite her rudeness, insolence and rabid teen angst, is convinced that any parental discipline is cruel and unusual punishment. In a final irony, the girls brutal move ensures that they will never have the one thing they both desire most.

Long before he became King of Middle Earth, director Jackson displayed his inherent talent for both reality and fantasy in this gripping little flick, a fabulous combination of flawless acting, a harrowing and insightful script, and direction that is jaw-droppingly original whenever the girls real and fantasy worlds overlap.",1422576000,,2232,5.20891364902507

645537,4,6303433766,"One of the reviews for this movie on Amazon said that ""Heavenly Creatures"" explained how Peter Jackson was entrusted to film Lord of the Rings after having done little more than low budget splatter movies, and that is an apt description. This is the earliest of Peter Jackson movies I have seen (or probably ever will see since I have no interest in the type of movies he used to make before he hit it big). This movie had the potential of being a disaster - it is based on a notorious murder case , and like James Cameron's ""Titanic"" faces the challenge of everybody knowing how the movie is going to end before the film ever starts. It involves an almost cliche series of flashback scenes and a lot of stop-motion fantasy scenes intercut with live action shots and even a few scenes were the actresses appear to physically interact with the stop-motion characters. And it relies on the hackneyed technique of having one of the characters mentalizing her diary entries to move the story along in several scenes. In the hands of lesser film makers, any one of these challenges might have led to a disaster, but Peter Jackson managed to pull it off quite nicely. I did not notice one single superimposition line when the claymation characters and the live action characters interact, and the scene where a black and white Orson Wells pursues the girls was downright creepy. The movie nicely captures life in the 1950s and I did not catch any obvious blunders where modern gadgets accidently appear in a scene. Even the telephone cords are vintage, twisted cloth covered braided wire. The film quotes the outdated notion that intimate relations between two people of the same gender is something that needed to be ""cured"", an attitude straigh out of the fifties, too. That said, this is not a perfect film. Peter Jackson hadn't yet entirely divorced himself from his Splatter Film origins, and some of the themes in ""Heavenly Creatures"" were handled much more delicately and artistically in ""The Lovely Bones"", but you can see Jackson's mastery of the medium begin to peek through here and there. And I've got to say it - in the scene where the two girls are sharing a tub and plotting their crime, Jackson manages to make Kate Winslet look almost ghastly, using only lighting, a change of makeup and camera angles, and anybody who can do that is a true artist.",1410912000,,2359,4.700483091787439

645545,4,6303433766,"Two teenaged girls in 1950s New Zealand form an obsessive friendship that ends in tragedy when their parents attempt to separate them.

Director Peter Jackson and co-writer Fran Walsh developed a powerful film from a factual crime that shocked Kiwis in the middle of the 20th century.  Jackson and Walsh made the proper decision to base their film on the friendship of the two girls, climaxing with the crime and entirely ignoring the details of their trial and conviction.  This allows us to empathize with the girls, even though we know that something awful is going to happen, and making the climactic event seem almost as tragic for the perpetrators as it was for the victim.  Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, in their screen debuts, give powerful performances.

645805,5,6303433766,"When I ran across a VHS tape of this, in a thrift store, I had never heard of the movie, or of the true story that it was based on.

I only knew, given the date of the release (per the VHS tape sleeve), that it would represent one of the first feature films in which Kate Winslet appeared (it turns out that it was *the* first) ... and I recognized the actress who played the other lead role (as in, I strongly suspected that it was an actress I'd seen in productions since, but had never seen her at so young an age, and had no idea that she'd been acting this long), but I hadn't previously known her name (something that can be said of many terrific character actors), and suspected that it might be one of the first feature films in which she appeared (as with Kate Winslet, it turns out to have been Melanie Lynskey's feature film debut).

I was also intrigued by the fact that Peter Jackson directed, co-produced, and co-wrote the screenplay for the film -- and given the honors bestowed upon him over the past decade, I was curious to see an example of his work from early in his career.

Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson's long-time writing (and life) partner, had originally heard of the events (upon which the film is based) when she was 10, and news of the associated crime and trial were reported extensively in newspapers (in New Zealand, where the events occurred), and had shocked the country.

Fran remained interested in the case... and after she recommended to Peter that they write a screenplay based on the events, it was ultimately decided that they would focus on the girls' friendship, rather than the murder and trial -- and there are several reasons why it made/makes sense for them to have done so.

Interestingly, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson engaged in a nationwide search for people who had had close association with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (the girls whose actions form the basis of the film) back when the friendship, and the events in question, took place -- 40 years before.

According to online sources, this involved tracking down the girls' former classmates and teachers, 17 of whom were interviewed... and speaking with family friends, colleagues, neighbors, psychologists, police, and lawyers.

Importantly, the background research for the film also included Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson reading Pauline's diary, which contained daily entries of detailed description of the friendship, and events associated with such.

All of the voiceover narration in the film is of excerpts from Pauline's diary (this is conveyed to the viewer via a brief statement, at the beginning of the film).

Fran Walsh searched 'high and low', in a widespread search of schools from throughout New Zealand, for someone who looked a lot like Pauline, and could act. The difficulty in finding such an actress ultimately culminated in the discovery of Melanie Lynskey.

The first casting calls took place in 1992. Kate Winslet won the role of Juliet, over 175 others who had auditioned.

The incredible performances of the co-lead actresses in this film is rendered all the more astonishing when one considers their respective ages at the time of filming (Winslet was born in October 1975, and Lynskey in May 1977).

Peter Jackson's creative direction for this film is quite amazing, and the visual effects used (and back in the early 1990s, no less), to bring the rich fantasy life of the girls 'to life', are not only highly creative, but visually captivating, and the montage 'sequences' in question (and especially when they 'overlap' a reality-based scene) are innovative and 'arresting'.

As with various other fascinating 'older' movies that I happen to ultimately 'stumble upon', I am then curious (after viewing such a film) about what others had to say about the film, and especially from back when it was released.

It turns out (and what an odd little coincidence this is) that I happen to have watched this film (yesterday) on the 19th anniversary of the date associated with Roger Ebert's review of the film.

And while my few movie reviews don't tend to focus on a 'retelling' of a film's plot (given that so many other reviews tend to already have done so), and do, instead, focus more on things I find to be exceptional or noteworthy, or convey reflections I found myself 'chewing on' after viewing a film, etc., I did find a few of Roger Ebert's comments to be rather interesting, and find that I am in agreement with him, when it comes to his 'take' on the film -- and thought I'd include a few excerpts, for those who might not have viewed other (and plot-centered) reviews of this film --

------------------
The movie shows the crime as resulting from a tragic confluence of coincidences: Two girls, both emotionally unstable in just the right way to complement each other's weaknesses, are outsiders in a Christchurch girls' school. [...]
------------------

------------------
The girls are separated when one contracts tuberculosis.

They begin to write each other long, detailed letters about the events in an imaginary country they have created, with dream castles and heroic figures with which they identify. Jackson uses fantasy sequences to make this world as real for us as it is to the girls, who inhabit it as an alternative to the daily lives they find dreary.
------------------

------------------
Casting is a delicate matter in telling a story like this, and in Melanie Lynskey as Pauline and Kate Winslet as Juliet, Jackson has found the right two actresses. There is a way Lynskey has of looking up from beneath glowering eyebrows that lets you know her insides are churning. And Juliet, superficially so ""bright"" and normal, laughs too much, agrees too quickly, always exists just this side of hysteria.
------------------

------------------
The insight of ""Heavenly Creatures"" is that sometimes people are capable of committing acts together that they could not commit by themselves. A mob can be as small as two persons. [...] In the case of Pauline and Juliet, that truth is complicated by their own emotional maladjustments. What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.
------------------

Lastly, on a final note...

This film was released in 1994, and to well-deserved critical acclaim, and high praise in reviews from around the world. Laudatory attention was focused on the acting of the co-lead actresses, and for Jackson's directing, as well as for the screenplay, which was co-written by Walsh and Jackson, and was nominated for an Academy Award (that year's award for Best Original Screenplay ended up going to Quentin Tarantino, for ""Pulp Fiction"").

Of the various terms used by others to describe this film, and its acting, direction, cinematography, and script...the following descriptors are among those I find to reflect my perception and 'conclusions', as well --

Exemplary, imaginative, disturbing, stunning, haunting, incisive, shocking, complex, thoughtful, astonishing, unforgettable, superb, dark, masterpiece...

This is a riveting story, told in a magnificently rendered fashion, and is considered by some to be the best true crime film they've ever seen.

I remain 'taken aback' by just how incredible this film is, and will now be sure to obtain a DVD version of such -- especially given that the DVD releases in Region 1 format include an 'uncut' version of the film, which is 109 minutes, versus the 99 minutes found in the original runtime version (and which is associated with the VHS, laserdisc, and DVD Regions 2 & 4 releases, as well as the version streamed on Netflix and HuluPlus).

This film is an early peek at the genius of Peter Jackson's remarkable directorial talent and vision, and the great collaborative writing from the earlier years of the now-20-plus-years-along team of Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson.

That being said, Melanie Lynskey is reported to have said that Jackson and Walsh acted as co-directors.

Ok, still with me?

Then let me list the reasons why one might want to see this film:

1)  You are a big Peter Jackson fan, and you'd like to learn more about the films he made before the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy; you'd also like to see why his films made him an excellent choice to helm the ""LOTR"".

2)  You are a big Kate Winslet fan, and you'd like to see her in her cinematic debut (her performance here clearly establishes her as a major dramatic talent).

3)  You like very off-beat films about deranged personalities.

4)  You're a film buff, and you're always interested in high-quality films, and based on the reviews here on Amazon, you would like to check this one out.

If your reason for viewing this film isn't articulated above, then don't bother with this one.  This isn't your average Friday night DVD entertainment.

Still interested?  Read on.

I won't explain the plot in this review; if you need a basic overview of the plot, check out some of the other reviews, or read it on wikipedia.

What I will tell you, first and foremost, is that watching this film, you can see how Peter Jackson certainly made a very logical choice to helm the ""LOTR"" trilogy.  Why?  His ability to bring us into the minds, the thoughts, and the feelings of deranged, outcast personalities is almost parless.  Only someone who had clearly demonstrated such abilities could be trusted to bring a major character like Gollum to the big screen, and Jackson's intimate protrayal of these two girls, and their murderous machinations towards one of their mothers, is nothing short of amazing.

Why is it amazing?  Because we're taken into these girls' psyches, and there we're shown how both self-centered and obsessed with one another they are.  They do not seem to have any real connection or bond with anyone outside of themselves and their profoundly twisted and dysfunctional relationship.  Yet this film does not demand any particular judgment from us; rather, one gets the impression that this film seeks merely to present us this terrible tragedy, and let us draw from it whatever lessons we can.

Jackson does the same thing in ""LOTR""; we journey into Gollum's split personality, and we find that issues of self-centeredness, obsession, and irrationality abound; yet again, we're not there to judge Gollum (especially since Gandalf doesn't seem to judge him so much as pity him).

The upshot?  Watching ""Heaven Creatures"" gives one insight into why Jackson was clearly an excellent choice for ""LOTR""; he can portray obsessed and irrational characters whose interaction with the world outside of themselves veers from the seemingly rational to the clearly irrational.  ""Heavenly Creatures"" is indisputable evidence of this.

However ...

While it might have been possible to pity Gollum rather than hate him, it's difficult to be at all sympathetic to Juliet and Gina.

(beware, plot-spoilers follow)

One reviewer here posted that ""almost in spite of ourselves, (we) are completely in sympathy with their decision (although afterwards, we shake ourselves back into rationality, and wonder why they came to such a desperate conclusion), we accept the racing towards inevitability that they seemed to have felt.""

I certainly respect differing perceptions and points of view, but I don't agree that it is inevitable that one will sympathize with the girls' desperation, so much so that a plot to kill Gina's mother begins to seem rational, even if only for a short time.  Rather, what is so successfully protrayed here is the extremely intense and profoundly emotional symbiotic relationship these two teenage girls shared with one another.  The film's exploration of this relationship serves to explain to the viewer the context in which this murder was planned and carried out, illustrating to the viewer the girls' motive.  But I must disagree  that one is inevitably drawn into the girls' emotional world; I, for one, was not.

And why was I not drawn in?  Gina's mother was not evil, not abusive, and very much did not deserve the terrible crime committed against her.  Not that anyone ""deserves"" to be bludgeoned to death with a brick; I use the word ""deserve"" to illustrate that this film protrays Gina's mother truly as a victim.  While she did not understand her daughter Gina, it can hardly be argued that she somehow brought the girls' murderous plot upon herself.  Her care and concern for Gina was evident throughout the film, even if it was equally evident that she had no idea how to reach her daughter.

This film is very much a tragedy, and as much as the context of this murder is protrayed as a repressive society that doesn't give these young ladies a chance to discover their own, unique identities, neither does this film attempt to excuse or justify the murder these girls commit.  (I, for one, was very surprised by how little time both spent in prison).

So, to sum up, yes, this is a high-quality film; it's well-acted, directed and photographed.  Quality is not the issue; your motive to see it is what comes into play.  As aforementioned, if you are looking into either Peter Jackson's or Kate Winslet's background, or, you like stories about deranged personalities who, in their obsession with one another, seem to both isolate themselves from their surrounding familial and social environments, whilst casting their own twisted judgments upon the same, then, well, this film is for you!

But if you're just looking for some interesting-yet-entertaining Friday night escapism, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.

This is a good film, but if you're not looking for this kind of story, you won't find much to like here.",1324339200,,5848,4.8932926829268295
645941,5,6303433766,"Before Anne Perry became famous as a novelist she was famous as Juliet Humle who helped murder her best friend's mother. Director Peter Jackson chose to tell a fictionalized version of what occurred in 1954 for his first serious and mainstream films ""Heavenly Creatures"" a film that displays his remarkable ability to tell suspenseful stories while also handling the fantasy elements exceptionally well.

Featuring Kate Winslet in one of her earliest roles as Juliet Hulme and Melanie Lynskey as Pauline Rieper, the film nicely captures the flavor of the 50's and the often represssive atmosphere that existed at the time. Both actresses do exceptional jobs in their roles and the supporting cast give marvelous supporting performances.

The Blu-ray looks quite nice but keep in mind that the film was shot intentionally ""soft"" particularly during the fantasy sequences of the film. Detail is stronger here than the older DVD and there are nice textures throughout while color looks terrific and isn't oversaturated.

The audio likewise has some limitations but the 2.0 DTS lossless sound is extremely good--there's loads of detail and dialogue comes across with good clarity.

My only complaint is that Lion's Gate has chosen NOT to include any special features. As I recall there was a short documentary produced for this film and that certainly should have been included. It's also disappointing that Lion's Gate either didn't ask for(or Jackson chose not to provide) a commentary track. Given how pivotal this film was in establishing Jackson's reptuation as a ""serious"" film director I'm surprised there's nothing here that also discusses his choice to make this project.

Although the lack of special features is disappointing, ""Heavenly Creatures"" IS an improvement over the previous DVD editions and fans will want to pick this terrific, disturbing movie up.

645943,5,6303433766,"This is not a review of the movie; we know how great it is, but an insight on the technical aspects of this Canadian import version of the blu-ray release, region A, which does play in the US.  I did a side by side comparison of exact scenes w/ the upscaled dvd (via HDMI) and this blu-ray.

1) The first and foremost noticeable eye opener are some cropping (missing information) on the sides of the picture of both versions, and vice versa.  Let me explain.  In a large majority of camera shots, either the tops and bottoms, or the sides are missing on the dvd or blu-ray, and vice versa.  In simple film school terms, it is panned and scanned (P&S) differently.  I use the term P&S loosely because as you know it's associated w/ old 4:3 full screen, but the point is that the picture editing, cropping, and zooming are different.  I chose several exact scenes that were not in motion, and I paused at the exact location to compare.  The P&S-ing is regardless of the aspect ratio, 1.79:1 Blu-Ray, 2.35:1 DVD.

2) The 1080i blu picture is only slightly better than the upscaled dvd picture.  Blu-ray picture still contains jitters and artifacts considering a 16 years old (1994) transfer.  Colors at times are not as accurate, so the noticeable improvement is in the definition (resolution), however only slightly.

3) Blu-ray: The sound of the English 2.0 track is very low, while the French 2.0 is loud.  Volume just needs manual adjusting, which is annoying that these 2 language tracks are not standardized (or equalized).

4) Blu-ray contains no extra materials.  DVD contains Trailer.  Hence, you might think I'm keeping both the blu and the dvd versions, yes, I recommend that.  In fact, I'm keeping the VHS as well!  That old clunker is the original, cut (edited), theatrical version.",1291075200,26,1792,4.725806451612903

I didn't expect much from the film initially but on the very first view, I was left amazed, totally in awe as the film had completely taken me back to the 1950's when the really sad incident took place. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey deliver a satisfying performance, their chemistry is dazzling to witness on screen, the rest of the cast do a very remarkable work. The fact that the film is based on a true story had me thinking twice. 'Heavenly Creatures' shines with good character study, cast-performance and direction and most of us make us all witness two teenage girls in a real dramatic and thrilling journey of their life, leading to shocking consequences.

645994,5,6303433766,"Truth is often much more enthralling than fiction.  This statement has never been more accurate than when examining Peter Jackson's unforgettable film, ""Heavenly Creatures."" Set during the early 1950's, this film explores the obsessive friendship and desperate loneliness of two young girls.

In Christ Church, New Zealand, Pauline Reiper is an introverted 14-year-old who lives with her mother and father, Honora and Herbert.  The family runs a boardinghouse, and Pauline keeps to herself.
Enter Juliet Hume, a flamboyant, romantically-minded, yet ultimately tormented girl from an upper-class family.  Her father, Henry, rector of Canterbury college, has moved his family to Christ Church.
The two girls meet at school.  They find that they share many common interests: a love for opera, art, literature, and medieval life.  They also find that they were both afflicted with illness at young ages.  As the girls friendship progresses, they create an elaborate ""Fourth World,"" and a fantasy kingdom called Brovnia.  fantasy and reality merge with rapid frequency.  When the girls parents try to separate them, Pauline and Juliet lash out in the only way they feel they can.

This movie grabs you from the very beginning.  Pauline's lower class life is wonderfully contrasted to Juliet's prestigious one.  Pauline comes from a family who truly loves her, (Sarah Paierce and Simon O'Connor turn in stellar performances as Pauline's parents), yet Juliet comes from a self-centered background.  Her parents are self-absorbed and rarely give Juliet the attention she craves.  Perhaps the most heartwrenching scene is the one where Juliet is abandoned by her parents when she is ill with tubercolosis.

Mostly, we see the events unfold through Pauline's eyes.  She sees Juliet's life as ideal and longs to be a part of Juliet's family.  The script intersperses verbatim diary entries from Pauline that provide a glimps into her mind.  I especially liked the fact that the girls were not portrayed as helpless victims, but humans responsible for their actions.  None of the principle characters are ""cookie-cutter"" representations but real humans who struggle.  The portrayals are chilling yet also sympathetic.  Kate Winslet is excellent as Juliet.  Her over-the-top performance provides a glimpse into the mind of a wildly imaginative yet sad child.  Melanie Lynsky is superb as Pauline, and the viewer understands how the girls were drawn to each other in real life: they had such similar personalities.
My only complaint about the film is the lesbian subplot and the treatment of Christianity.  I can understand why Juliet would have trouble believing God's love, especially when one considers the hypocrisy exhibited by her parents.  Juliet has been reported to say that she and Pauline were obsessive, but they never engaged in a sexual relationship.

I just learned from researching the case that Juliet Hume is now writing under the name Anne Perry! I was absolutely astonished! Anne Perry's writing is excellent, and I am greatly comforted to know that both girls are free.  It is truly tragic that such young lives were ruined by irrational fear, and that a kindhearted woman lost her life.

This film reminded me of the importance of being a good mentor to children.  We can all learn to give kids support and to be available to help them whenever possible.  Please give this enthralling film a chance.  God bless you all.",1280188800,2,3427,5.210237659963437
645995,1,6303433766,"I cannot understand why there are only five-star reviews for this film, I just finished watching it and I was not only bored to death but also horrified by the weak story, weak performances and over-all lack of anything creative or inspiring. It started out good though, the first scene into the story is that of the two main characters, covered in blood and screaming. This screaming would continue throughout the rest of the story, as it seems the two girls don't know how to do anything else. Pauline looks like a stubborn and self-pitifull child whenever she's around adults and the actress portraying her could only find one way to express Pauline's feelings, by contantly moping around and making over-acted comical faces. Seriously, after half an hour I was sick of the constant screaming giggles I could only perceive. Kate Winslet's performance was slightly better, she kept a certain degree of dignity into her playing. Another thing that puzzled me is why Pauline had to go have sex with this guy who was supposedly in love with her, while she'd been praising her feelings for Juliet and was so heartbroken when she had to go to the hospital. Overall; bad and terribly over-acted performances, weak dialogues (even the imaginary scenes are unimaginative as hell, add to that that the visual effects are really bad as well) and just completely uninteresting story-line. The ending was better though, except that it didn't seem to match the story-line at all, it could have been a good ending to another film.",1277510400,6,1518,4.887596899224806
645996,5,6303433766,"This is a beautifully directed 1994 movie by Peter Jackson which tells the true story of two teenage girls in New Zealand. This role was Kate Winslet's debut at age 17. She immediately went from this role to receive an Oscar nomination for Sense and Sensibility in 1995, followed by starring roles in Jude and Hamlet in 1996. Then came the bombshell that was Titanic in 1997.
Shortly thereafter, Peter Jackson directed three hugely successful Lord of the Rings movies in 2001-03. This is where it all began for two cinema legends. Don't miss it.",1256947200,2,545,4.747368421052632
645997,5,6303433766,"This film distinguishes itself in so many ways.  It marks the arrival of Peter Jackson as a cinematic voice to be reckoned with.  His melding of bone-chilling reality and terror and fantasy suggests his later works, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the underappreciated remake of King Kong.  In her film debut Kate Winslet arrives auspiciously as the sickly daughter of a disfunctional upper class family.  Not to take anything away from Jackson and Winslet, who would be the selling points here, is the work of Melanie Linskey.  Aside from the scene in the beginning that forbodes the film's shocking conclusion I thought Linskey telegraphed her performance with a Kubrickian stare as she poses for a photograph with her smiling private school classmates.  Don't be fooled.  Linskey's turn is one of great subtlety as she assays the insecurities and loneliness of Pauline Parker.  Seemingly polar opposites Parker and Winslet's Juliet Hulme serve a need in each other that would ultimately become lethal.  ""Heavenly Creatures"" stylistically is unlike any film I've seen before and serves as not only one of the great film's produced in New Zealand but one of the best films of the Nineties.",1256256000,6,1194,5.051020408163265
645998,5,6303433766,"This is Peter Jackson's first wholly serious movie, after his early spatter comedies, and is also Kate Winslet's first film. It is based on a true story, and the diary entries read aloud in the film are actually from the diary of Pauline Parker, played here wonderfully by Melanie Lynskey, before she fell to such crap fare as Coyote Ugly and Sweet Home Alabama. By the way, the real Juliet Hulme went on to become popular and prolific mystery writer Anne Perry! She apparently refuses to talk about the incident in the film and has never confirmed what actually happened.

The film opens with a 1950s documentary about Christchurch, New Zealand, which are all over-vivid colors and over-chipper happiness and contentment. This smash-cuts into footage of the girls running and screaming, blood spattered all over their faces. We flash back to 1953, in which Juliet is introduced as the new girl at school. She is quite superior and precocious, proclaiming her love of art and Mario Lanza. She and Pauline begin to bond because they are both excused from gym class because of health maladies and vast amounts of childhood time spent in hospitals. Juliet still has tuberculosis, although it is then not bothering her.

They start to spend vast amounts of time together, usually at the house of Juliet's parents, who are wealthy. They invent an entire medieval-themed world of a royal family and their court, acting out scenes they've invented, and creating clay figures of its prominent characters. The film often segues into fantasy sequences in which the background changes around the girls or they interact with a world of walking clay figures. They are often running around in breathless excitement, seemingly excitement for the sheer enjoyment of excitement, and shunning anyone outside of their union. ""We decided how sad it is for other people, who do not understand our genius,"" Pauline writes. In their relationship, it seems that Juliet is content to be brilliant, and Pauline is delighted to worship her.

There is a tinge that flirts with lesbianism in their relationship, although more in a devotional than sexual way. But it comes out in the intensity of their love, absolute devotion to each other, and scenes in which they play at being the married king and queen, at one point enacting Juliet giving birth to Pauline's baby [as the king and queen]. Both adult women later said that there was nothing lesbian in their relationship, although that question often simply means ""did they have sex?"" and excludes the deeper love and devotion that could also indicate a lesbian relationship.

Soon Juliet's tuberculosis flares up, and her parents place her in a distant hospital while they leave the country for a few months. Juliet and Pauline exchange letters every day, written as the king and queen, in which they express their undying devotion. This separation came at a welcome time for both sets of parents, who had begun to become worried about the intensity of the friendship. Juliet's upper class parents worry that the working-class Pauline is corrupting their daughter, and Pauline's own parents seem to consider her the main source of the problem as well. They take her to a psychologist who outright says she is passing through a phase of lesbianism, which he classifies as a ""mental disorder."" Around this time Pauline has started to focus on her mother as the source of her problems, and think what a wonderful day it would be if her mother were murdered.

SPOILERS > > >
There is upset at Juliet's home, as her mother takes in a needy patient [she's a psychologist], and is soon revealed to be having an affair with him, right in her own home. Juliet's father loses his university job at this point, and it is decided that the parents will split, and Juliet will move to South Africa. Both girls then decide to go ahead and murder Pauline's mother so that they can later run away together. They plan to bludgeon her with brick wrapped in a stocking. Their mental states at this time are characterized with numerous flights into the fantasy world of the clay royal family. Finally the ""blessed day"" arrives. They go on a picnic to a remote area with Pauline's mother, distract her, and as she turns away, bash her with the brick. They have to hit her repeatedly, becoming covered with blood, and we connect this with them running, bloody, after the murder, as we saw in the film's opening moments.

Soon after this the film ends, and we have some titles telling us that their plot was soon unraveled, and they were both sent to prisons, their sentence including the clause that they could never see each other again. The film portrays this with a fantasy sequence in which Juliet is on a cruise ship, slowly sailing away and leaving Pauline forlorn on the dock.
< < < SPOILERS END

It's quite good, very rich, and leaves you with a lot to think about. Not so much the story, which pretty much starts at point A, gets to point B and then stops, but the characterization, the way the story is told, and the texture of the relationship. I have a very learned Freudian psychologist friend who I often consult, and he had a little story I thought of while watching this film. He was in therapy with HIS analyst, and my friend said he didn't understand the kind of hysteria young women can get into, for example the famous footage of girls swooning over the Beatles. His psychologist thought that for young girls, the excitement IS the excitement, and the very screaming and jumping and swooning is IN ITSELF the fun. This was on my mind while watching this film, as it really plays on that, as the two girls ramp up their fun by constantly running and screaming over made-up crises or triumphs.

What is interesting about the film is the way it shows the way the girls serve as an echo chamber for each other, amplifying their frenzy until it takes a murderous turn. It also does a good job of dramatizing the facts and creatively portraying their fantasy world, but without ever providing an easy answer or pat explanation as to why their friendship veered into murder in this case. Everyone's performance is good, but the two leads are really wonderful and deliver committed performances that seem mature beyond their years. If you're in the mood for an interesting psychological portrait with a major in female psychology and a minor in lesbian overtones and a murder thrown in for good measure, this one's for you.",1253232000,2,6437,4.77717879604672

646063,5,6303433766,"Peter Jackson's savagely brilliant `Heavenly Creatures' has to be his finest cinematic moment.  Sure, he astounded millions (and won Oscars) for his `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but he has never been as honest and as human as he was with his delicate handling of this startling true life story.

The film opens with a sequence as shocking as its conclusion; the image of two blood soaked teenage girls floating across the screen.  This opening lays a solid foundation for the masterpiece we are about to witness.  `Heavenly Creatures' tells the story of young Pauline Parker, a social outcast who lives under the strict rule of her parents Herbert and Honorah.  She has no friends and truly no life until she meets Juliet Hulme, the beautiful and interesting new girl.  The two girls bond quickly and that bond grows deeper and stronger with time.  That bond is threatened though when their parents begin to suspect that maybe the girls are too close and attempt to separate them.  What happens as a result is as horrific as it is heartbreaking.

Peter Jackson's visual styling here is marvelous; the way he interjects colors and shapes to deepen the meaning behind many events in the film and to embellish the relationship between Pauline and Juliet.  This is especially evident when studying the fantasy world the two girls create for themselves.

`Heavenly Creatures' truly sinks into the minds of these two girls, sheltered from the outside world and jaded by everyone around them except one another.  As their devotion towards one another grows they retreat into their fantasy world, a world where they can be together always.  They have alternate identities (Pauline is `Gina' and Juliet is `Devora') and they gallivant around clay figures and sing Mario Lanza songs and are ultimately free from the confines of their natural born existence.

This film also marks the big screen debut of both Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet.  Both girls are flawless here, utterly flawless.  Lynskey captures the desperation and loneliness that engulfs her character, a loneliness that could lead someone to kill.  Her relationship with her parents is fleshed out beautifully, and Lynskey portrays the perfect emotions at the precise time to make her character not only believable but truly sympathetic.  Kate Winslet is a revelation as Juliet.  She embodies her character with confidence and sophistication and natural charm.  It's apparent from her first role that she would become a legend, and look now, just fourteen years later, and she has five Oscar nominations to her name.  Alongside Winslet and Lynskey there is also a stunning performance given by Sarah Peirse, who plays Honorah, Pauline's mother.  Her performance is brilliant, controlled and commanding and breathtakingly honest.

`Heavenly Creatures' is a wonder of a film; at times soft and delicate, charming and sweet and then savage and brutal; a film that will capture your heart and soul and tears it to pieces.  As some have mentioned, there are no villains here, only victims, and I think that Jackson's handling of the sensitive material helps translate that important point.  By filming almost entirely on location (that is exact location of events) as well as having exerts from Pauline's actual diary read throughout, Peter Jackson helps create a sense of honesty, a sense of truism that permeates this impeccable film.  `Heavenly Creatures' may be hard to watch, especially as the film draws to its shocking conclusion, but there is no denying that film this powerful is nothing short of heaven-sent.",1210204800,2,3570,5.09106529209622
646064,5,6303433766,"Great movie, but I feel that Winslet's character had more to do with the tragic end of the friendship than Lynskey's character.

It seems that a lot of the reviews put 60% of the blame on Pauline because she's the dark, gloomy one, but really the wholesome Juliet had the more screwed up family life and outlook; especially when it came to her own abandonment issues.  Pauline was a perfect sounding board for Juliet's poor family life.  And as the friendship and teen pressures increased, both girls literally got lost in a world all their own.

646069,5,6303433766,"The true-life tale told in Peter Jackson's often deceptively meandering Heavenly Creatures is one of lurid murder, and it possesses the ability to make a viewer recoil, not only because of the identity of the victim in the particularly heinous and cold blooded crime, but because of the identity of the killers. When I was in Christchurch, New Zealand this year, I happened to mention the Parker-Hulme murder, and the reactions I received from people my own age and younger showed that even fifty-three years after they occurred, the case still holds power over the collective memory of that normally peaceful nation. When I came home I watched Heavenly Creatures for the first time since high school, and found it probably even more troubling than I did years ago.

Before he was better known in the United States for making The Lord of the Rings, New Zealand native Peter Jackson shot this fantasy-heavy version of a killing he'd grown up hearing so much about. He cast Kate Winslett and Melanie Lynskey as Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, two slightly off-center girls whose unusual detachment from reality and somewhat disordered species of lesbianism set up a disturbing background for their premeditated crime. While the concept of adolescents who kill family members is less novel to us today than it was generations back, to enter into the minds and secret lives of Pauline and Juliet still makes for a unique sort of head trip. I also found the realization that Jackson shot nearly all of Heavenly Creatures on the actual sites of the events depicted generates a peculiar frisson in me every time I settle in to watch it. Jackson shot the tea shop scene in the actual restaurant in which Mrs. Parker had her last meal moments before her slaying, and as rumor has it, was set to shoot the death segment literally atop the actual ground on which the murder took place, but felt there was something too troubling in the act, so he re-located a short space away. In my opinion it's little details like these that only add to the creepy quality of Heavenly Creatures.

In a side note, Juliet Hulme went on in later life to become a best selling novelist---of murder/detective fiction, no less---and is still writing today under the pen name of Anne Perry.",1188864000,3,2259,4.804627249357327

The source is the shocking and scary Parker-Hulme murder case in 1954 Christchurch that galvanized New Zealand.  The case is less well known in the United States, and a gorgeous new letterboxed DVD has no bonus material [....]

I don't know how much plot to give away here, except to say that the film ends with a violent crime that is hinted at in the opening scene when teenagers Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (an auspicious film debut for both Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) come running out of a forest covered in blood and saying someone is dead.  We then flash back to 1952 and work our way forward to a 1954 finale.  The movie was filmed in Panavision (by Alun Bollinger) in rich yellows and oranges as the two girls develop a deep friendship that includes kisses and baths together.  The two are very different.  Pauline is shy and inward, while Juliet is open and sophisticated.  The daughter of a university professor, Juliet has been all over the world at age 15 and suffers from tuberculosis.  Pauline is a quiet wallflower who has never left New Zealand.

The more their parents and teachers worry about their friendship, the more Juliet and Pauline retreat inside a fantasy world of claymation figures, gorgeous gardens, and Mario Lanza records.  In that fantasy world, Juliet is nicknamed ""Devora"" and Pauline is called ""Yvonne"" or ""Gina"".  I adore a musical number in the fantasy world, with the girls dancing to Mario singing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" (It is the real Lanza on real records throughout the film.)  Yellows and oranges blend with scary blues on nighttime interiors.  Writers Jackson and Frances Walsh got an Oscar nomination for their Original Screenplay.  I like the way teen sex in the real world is juxtaposed against religion and murder in the fantasy world.

And I like the way colors contrast  and the way the real world of early 1950's Christchurch contrasts with the fantasy world of WETA design clay figures.  The technical credits will be very familiar to anyone who has seen a LORD OF THE RINGS movie--editor Jamie Selkirk, costumer Ngila Dickson, writers Jackson and Walsh (husband and wife), production designer Grant Major, and others.  It's a beautifully made movie.

The ending packs a shocking jolt, even when you can guess what will happen.  It will haunt you for days afterwards and give you many sleepless nighs.  HEAVENLY CREATURES deserves its ""R"" rating (for violence and sexual content).  Juliet has to go to South Africa with Dad for her health (lung tuberculosis), which gets Pauline distraught and even suicidal.  She has a frighteningly amoral solution.  ""It can be an accident,"" she rationalizes.  ""People die every day.""  So a crime will take place.  End crawls with a haunting Lanza rendition of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" say the girls were too young for the death penalty, so they were imprisoned until adulthood, then ordered never to see or write to one another again.  That's a rough punishment for these two.

Fascinatingly, it was divulged that Juliet and Pauline were taking anti-depressant drugs that have long since been banned from the market.  (I have mental illness myself and would love to know what the drugs were.  I'm sure my doctors would like to know also.)  And Juliet's story at least has a happy ending:  she surfaced several decades later in Scotland, where she currently writes murder mysteries under the name ""Anne Perry"".  I've read a couple of the novels, and they are outstanding.  So I am glad she was not executed in 1954.  I may be wrong, I'd have to check the web site.  But I think Pauline moved to England and found religion as an adult; that is not confirmed.

What a movie HEAVENLY CREATURES is for mature adults who feel up to its bloodbath finale.  It is flawlessly made, with gorgeous color and wide-screen, fascinating blendings of reality and fantasy that eventually become one for Juliet and Pauline.  It is chilling stuff, a true-life crime case.  It is fascinating to see the enormously talented Kate Winslet as a teenager at the start of a magnificent career; she was born an actress.  And it is interesting to see what Peter Jackson was up to before LORD OF THE RINGS.

The new DVD of CREATURES is the uncut 109 minute Director's Cut, never before seen in the United States.  The original American version ran 99 minutes.  I had also never seen the movie in Panavision since 1994 in a theater.  It really needs to be experienced in wide-screen format.  Seen uncut and in wide-screen in a night bedroom, I love CREATURES more than the cold LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, if not more than the wondrous KING KONG.  It is a must for the mature members of the Winslet and Jackson fan clubs.",1179360000,,4908,4.792610250297974

Famed director Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effects and great actors to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.

In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable; even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies.

But soon their parents becomes concerned that their close friendship is ""unhealthy."" It is, just not in the way he thinks. The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense: they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality. Now Juliet is being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.

Peter Jackson starts the movie by emphasizing what a beautiful, peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary) New Zealand is. But beauty is not everything -- fairy tales can become nightmares. Jackson doesn't just show the audience what the two girls did, but showed why they did it. Even then, he doesn't make excuses.

At first the movie seems almost whimsical, with fairy tale figures coming to life, beautiful woodlands, and hillsides transforming into blooming gardens. Nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies. Somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story.

But as the girls go deeper into infatuated madness, Jackson warps the whimsical world around them. Settings get darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out. The scripting keeps that creepiness going (""Our main idea for the day was to murder Mother""), as do Richard Taylor's handling of CGI and prosthetics. (How DID they do the zoom through a sand castle?)

But the movie really centers around Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, and these two carry the movie beautifully. Lynskey can switch in an instant from sullenness to smiles, naive girl to murderous woman. And the luminous Kate Winslet plays the somewhat devil-may-care Juliet, whose vivacity and charm overrule any of Pauline's reservations. ""It's everyone else who's bonkers!"" she says gleefully when Pauline casts doubt on her own sanity.

The most terrifying horror is the real kind -- the kind that is in the human heart. With its brilliant direction and equally good acting, ""Heavenly Creatures"" is destined to be a modern classic.",1177718400,,2866,5.163793103448276

646127,5,6303433766,"Opening with a startling sequence involving two blood soaked teenage girls, `Heavenly Creatures' begins and ends in tragedy.  Telling the shocking true story of two young girls who committed a terrible crime, this film is as accurate as it is moving.  Pauline and Juliet were just two girls in love, but when their families insisted on separating them they had no choice but to take matters into their own hands.

Melanie Lynskey and of course Kate Winslet work wonders with their roles, each one so different yet so much the same.  Melanie plays Pauline Rieper, the narrator of the story.  She's a bit of an outcast, living under strict watch of her parents Honorah (Sarah Pierce) and Herbert (Simon O'Connor), but when she meets Juliet things start to change for her.  As Juliet, Kate infuses so much natural charm into her character that you can instantly understand why Pauline would be attracted to her in the first place.  They instantly bond, growing closer to each other with their fantasies and stories.  Juliet's parents are much different than Pauline's.  They are much more lenient yet they tend not to take much interest in their young daughter, even going as far as to leave her when she goes ill, not seeing her for four months.

The girl's parents soon start to suspect something indecent between their daughters and try and separate them, to no avail.  When Juliet's health worsens and her parent's marriage starts to crumble they insist on sending Juliet away, out of the country without Pauline.  It's at this point that the plot is hatched to murder someone standing in their way...just who is it?  The end of this film, as shocking as the beginning, will leave you speechless.  Peter Jackson deserves honors for bringing this horrendous account to life and casting such wonderful talents to help in doing so.

Being the debut for both Winslet and Lynskey it definitely shows what amazing things they are capable of (I mean since her debut in '94 Kate Winslet has gone on to receive 4 Oscar nominations and may very well receive number 5 this year!).  This is not one to miss for any fan of a moving drama that delves deep into the minds of two young girls who just wanted to be together, no matter what!",1166054400,4,2224,4.72279792746114

While I found it intersesting and well filmed, it's not a movie that I will ever bother watching again. The limitation of this movie is, that it's a true story. The sureal lives of the characters are well portrayed, but the conclusion is abrupt and, while not graphic, is still sickening, especially when you know that people can behave like that and be out of prison within five years! If it was a work of fiction, maybe the girls would have been hanged and therefore given the viewer a sense of satisfaction.

646129,5,6303433766,"I saw this film years ago when it had its major theatrical release.  Years later, it remains as powerful.  The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.

I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers.  The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.

Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy - ick),  it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision - all fitting.  There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real.  Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.

Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their ""treatment,"" the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been shown to cause extreme violent outbursts.  It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made.  I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer.  But that would be icing.

646131,3,6303433766,"Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story about two teen girls who committed murder.  Many other reviwers have given detailed descriptions of the plot so I will forego that here. After some basic research subsequent to watching the film, it seems that Peter Jackson was quite faithful to the original story.  There were certain simplifications needed to fit the story into a two hour movie but that is to be expected.  The story told in this movie is a disturbing one.  The two girls are highly disturbed and engage in increasingly bizaar behavior leading up to the murder.  If you are interested in a character study about highly erratic and disturbed individuals then this movie will surely be of great interest to you.

For pure entertainment value, however, I must say that I found Heavenly Creatures to be lacking in the extreme.  The girls are loud, shrill, and incredibly irritating... at least to my sensibilities.  They are constantly singing (badly), shrieking either in laughter or tears, screaming at their parents, or wildly enthusing about their elaborate imaginary stories that they are continuously writing.  As a finale, these two bash one their mothers' head in with repeated blows from a brick in a fairly grisly scene that actually underplays the violence compared to the real life murder.  Quite simply, watching this movie forces you to endure two of the most annoying and disturbing people you could ever hope NOT to meet for a seemingly endless two hours.

This movie was very difficult to rate because it is such a mixed bag.  For historical accuracy and faithfulness to the real life events, I would give it 5 stars.  Yet, I found it of no entertainment value whatsoever and could not wait for it to end and I would normally give such a film 1 star.  Accordingly, I've split the difference and give it an overall rating of 3 stars.  For those who have never seen Heavenly Creatures, I would strongly urge you to think about whether this movie will appeal to you and not just take all the glowing reviews at face value.",1151280000,14,2046,4.7727272727272725

646193,4,6303433766,"I'll have to admit that my reason for wanting to see Heavenly Creatures was prurient. Anne Perry is one of my favorite mystery writers, and I was interested to see the movie Peter Jackson made about the murder she and her best friend committed as teen-aged girls.

Melanie Lynskey plays the part of Pauline Yvonne Parker, who grows up in a poor family. Her parents were never actually married, and they keep boarders in their home. Lynskey portrays Pauline as a very sullen teen-ager, and deserves much more credit for her portrayal than she has received. Very rarely do you see her exhibit true happiness in this film, and the few times she does, it is always when she is with her friend, whom she sees as the only way she has of excaping her horrible life.

Kate Winslet plays the part of Juliet Hulme, the privileged daughter of wealthy parents. To Pauline, it appears as though Juliet has the perfect life, but in fact, Julliet has a checkered past. Due to constant lung problems, her parents sent her away to live in the Bahamas for five years, leaving her in constant fear of abandonment. She meets Pauline on her first day of school after she and her family move to christchurch, New Zealand, and the two of them strike up a friendship.

Although the movie depicts a lesbian relationship between the two of them, Anne Perry has staunchly denied that they were anything but friends. Indeed, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Perry is telling the truth as teen-aged girls frequently develop ""crushes"" on each other and have extremely intense personal friendships without any sexual involvement.

What is obvious, though is that both girls were highly imaginative, and they both fulfilled a deep need in each other. Pauline needed to feel as though she were a part of Juliet's wealthy family, and Juliet needed to have someone she could count on not to leave her. Indeed, in one scene of the movie, Juliet has experienced a recurrence of tuberculosis and her parents put her in a convalescent home before leaving to spend several months in England. Pauline and her mother are the only people to visit Juliet during that terrible time.

Juliet's world comes crashing down when she learns that her parents are getting a divorce. Her father is going back to England and she is being sent to stay with an aunt in South Africa. Once again, she will be abandoned by her parents and, even worse, she will be separated from Pauline. Pauline convinces her that if they kill Pauline's mother, the two of them will be able to stay together.

It is sad watching the scene of Pauline's mother preparing to go out for a day's outing with her daughter and Juliet. It must have been one of the happiest days in the woman's life-- her daughter was taking her to tea and then to a park, and then her daughter and her daughter's friend savagely murder her. It is the opening scene of the movie, and the closing scene of the movie.

Peter Jackson does a stellar job of weaving the girls' fantasy world into the real life elements of the story. Although he has taken some liberties with the story, that can be excused as neither of the women involved participated in any way in the making of the film. I can't say that I really enjoyed the movie so much as I thought it was an interesting portrayal of a horrible crime. However, the movie is a superb acting vehicle for a very young Kate Winslet and for Melanie Lynskey, both of whom do a terrific job of portraying their characters. The movie also foreshadows Jackson's genius and his attention to detail that we see later in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

While I wouldn't want to watch the movie again, I am glad that I at least saw it. I've read about the crime and tried to picture the events in my head. Jackson did a terrific job of translating things that I've only read about into reality.",1145836800,19,3846,4.563768115942029

646199,5,6303433766,"Although raised in another part of the British Empire, my mother has admitted to vague recollections of this sinister story that rocked New Zealand in 1954.
  In the film that put Director Peter Jackson on the map, the tragic story of an obsessive teenage friendship in a more conservative time in his homeland is recounted through the diary entries of schoolgirl Pauline Yvonne Parker, a girl of a lower middle class family, whose main point of interest is her best friend, the aristocratic English girl, Juliet Hulme.
 In their respective initial film roles as the two girls, native New Zealander, Melanie Lynskey, and the appropriately British Kate Winslet, are superb.
 After we are led through a charming promotional film of early 1950s Christchurch, we then hear the bloodcurdling screams of two girls who, from a distance, appear to be at play, but who are hysterically running from the scene of a murder they just committed.
 Following an explanatory caption of the story, we are led into a world of prissy, bobbed-haired schoolgirls in uniforms, and it is at school that Pauline and Juliet meet and become bosom friends, linked by their common experiences of serious childhood illnesses, their love of art and writing, wildly imaginative behavior, and their love of Mario Lanza's singing--traits I myself had in common with them at that age, although I never took things as far as they did.
 We see the respective contrasts in the lifestyles of the two girls; Juliet's life as the daughter of Henry Hulme(Clive Merrison) the rector of  Canterbury College, his marriage-counselor wife, Hilda( Diana Kent, who is prettier than the actual Hilda Hulme), and with her young brother. Dressed as a princess  when Pauline first visits her at Ilam, her world appears to be an idyllic one.
 Pauline lives with her  father, mother, grandmother, and older sister (Simon O'Connor, Sarah Peirse, Lou Dobson, and Kirstie Ferry)in a boarding house, where her mother proves to be a justifyably strict disciplinarian, especially when Pauline has an affair with one of the boarders, and her grades in school slip.
 The girls' time together gallops merrily along to the tune of Lanza's ""Donkey Serenade"" , and other recordings, which never fail to make them giddy. I cringe at the scenes where copies of his albums are destroyed, having had that unfortunate experience myself, and have noted the irony of the singer's death around the time of the girls' release from prison.
 We see the girls' rejection of traditional religious values,  although one family still celebrate Christmas. When I first viewed this film, I experienced confusion about the actual names of the girls since they use so many of them for each other.
 There is a concern that the girls are having a lesbian affair--less acceptable in those days--although years later one of them denied this.
 When Juliet develops tuberculosis and has to be hospitalized for four months, her parents leave on a trip for England, continuing a long-standing pattern of depositing their daughter in a place from which they are often far away. Pauline and her mother are Juliet's only visitors.
 The striking thing about this tragedy is that Pauline, like many teenagers, deluded herself into thinking her friend had the perfect life despite evidence to the contrary. Granted that the Hulmes were elegant, highly educated people, who lived on a grand estate and Pauline's family weren't. But Pauline should have had more regard for her friend's chronic illness, emotional fragility, abandonment issues, and ultimately, an act of hedonism on the part of Juliet's mother that tears the Hulme Family apart--setting the stage for the coming tragedy--and counted her blessings, since her own family, such as it was, was still intact, and her own parents were much more attentive to her. Ironically, a long-hidden family secret-- barely touched upon during a feud Pauline has with her mother-- would emerge as a result of the tragedy in Victoria Park. But like many teenagers of today, Pauline could have learned to make the most of her own situation regardless of its disadvantages.
 In her poem, ""The Ones I Worship"", Pauline describes her feelings about herself especially when in Juliet's company. They are ""Heavenly Creatures"", superior to the common moral code. Psychologists call this view, the ""Personal Fable"", common among adolescents. Among Pauline's growing number of delusions is one of Dr. Hulme as her own father.
 Whether one views the edited or unedited version of this film--the latter of which shows more significant details--the portrayal of the girls' overactive fantasy life alternates between comical and surreal.
 When Juliet is slated to leave for South Africa to live with an aunt, the adults make the fateful decison to let the girls stay together until Juliet's departure.
 Questions with which I was left include,""What made Pauline assume Juliet's aunt would be as willing to take her in as she was her own niece?"", and, ""Did they really think murder would solve their problems?""
 As devastating as their impending separation was, Pauline should have accepted her parent's refusal to let her go with Juliet. Were it not for the murder of the flawed and complex mother who loved her, not only might the two girls have been reunited over time, but perhaps Pauline may have had a different perspective about the Hulmes, whose ineptitude in looking after their own children may have resulted in Pauline's neglect as well.
 Juliet, who is now, ironically, the Victorian-era murder mystery novelist, Anne Perry, has lamented certain inaccuracies in the film. But as she and Pauline, who was identified as Hilary Nathan three years after the film's release, were unavailable for consultation during production, which may have resulted in the illegal correspondance of the two women, Peter Jackson did his best with available rescources, and the stunning and haunting results speak well enough for themselves.",1129680000,5,5964,5.120494335736354
646200,2,6303433766,"BE WARNED! THIS IS NOT THE FILM YOU SAW IN THE THEATRE!

Much to my surprise, this arrived with the small words ""uncut version"" on the cover, and to my dismay, this was not a good thing. Peter Jackson's brilliant film, which gave Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey what may be the two best debut roles ever for young women, was a non-stop roller-coaster ride of mounting hysteria that mirrored the increasing intensity of the girls' relationship. This friendship between Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, which became deeply emotional, sexual, and ultimately so co-dependent that they simply could not tolerate the notion of separation, culminated in the violent murder of Pauline's mother, with the two girls bashing her head in repeatedly with a brick inside of a stocking(the scene is gruesome, but still understates reality, which is a shocking thing to learn). This crime shocked the quiet community of Christchurch, New Zealand so completely that Jackson starts his film with a propoganda movie the town had made to lure new residents, in order to give us an idea of what sort of place this was. He then begins to fade in screams of the girls, shots of their blood-streaked faces, and we are as shocked by the violence as the town was then (1954). In order to understand and sympathize with these girls, not an easy thing for a director to accomplish given the violence of their crime and the inability of such smart girls to find any other way to deal with their terror of separation, Jackson gets deep inside their heads very effectively, and more than sharing their fantasy world with us, takes us into it. And by keeping the pace of the film pumping along with such speed and focus that we feel the girls' pain, too, and almost in spite of ourselves, are completely in sympathy with their decision (although afterwards, we shake ourselves back into rationality, and wonder why they came to such a desperate conclusion), we accept the racing towards inevitability that they seemed to have felt. The tension and intensity are incredible, and without it, the film would never have worked.

The original cut of ""Heavenly Creatures"" gave us what we needed to maintain within ourselves this hysteria and to see from their points of view without stopping to question. This ""uncut version"" destroys that completely. It contains a 10-15 minute section that doesn't exist in the theatrical release, and which stops the film dead. The scenes are also longer, there's more dialogue in some, more time in ""The Fourth World"" (their fantasy world), and the editing is considerably less elegant. While some of these scenes add to our understanding of the girls, especially the rather bizarre details of Juliet's family life, and are therefore interesting to see, it's not the cut I'll watch again and again, as I do the original. It just doesn't work, and sadly, unless you realize that this wasn't the work of genius everyone was raving about, you'll wonder why we were raving about it. I don't believe anyone would have raved about this version, especially as the anguish of the ending is wrecked by an incredibly bad editing decision. Certainly I would not have raved about it, even if I could have seen its potential for genius.

It is very frustrating that now one can only get this version--there isn't even a choice between the two. I don't understand why this wasn't released in a two-sided or two-disk ""pick a version"" manner, or the extended/deleted scenes shown as ""deleted scenes"" often are on the original DVD. That this is the only choice now is infuriating, especially as, with no warning, one may discover it as I did, watching the opening sequence and thinking, ""Wait a minute...I don't remember this..."" While not everyone is like me with a photographic memory that genuinely knows films by heart, even noticing a different single edit in a scene if the film shows up on TV, most who loved this film will realize they're watching something different, and probably will only notice it after it's in the DVD player, making getting credit for a return more of a challenge. But the fact that this is not the original version is not, in my opinion, sufficiently explained in the information on the DVD info page. That this is NOT the original version should be shouted, as unlike ""Apocalypse Now Redux,"" it is not re-titled.

The comparison to ""Apocalypse Now"" is actually an appropriate one. In the Redux version, we can see scenes that add background about Vietnam (the presence of old French colonialist families still living there, for example), interesting conversations, etc., but its pace is deadly, and as with ""Heavenly Creatures"" we need to be on a voyage of inevitability, moving relentlessly towards the mysterious Kurtz. Without this ever-mounting tension, it's not the work of genius that the original cut is. But we have choices between the two, and that's as it should be. Why the extra and extended scenes in ""HC"" weren't just in a ""deleted scenes"" section on the original disk is a mystery, but this poor replacement is a disappointment that now is the only version first-time viewers can see without buying second-hand. Bad, bad call.

A note: Editing is everything. Everything. I learnt how to build a film from my editing teacher (who became my editor); it's in the editing that the film is either made or broken, and obviously Jackson knew that, and made all the right choices with his editor the first time around. Why he ruined his own work is a question someone should ask him. Please, if you can, check out the documentary, ""The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Editing"" to see what this final piece of a film project really consists of.",1125273600,18,5661,4.837977296181631
646201,5,6303433766,"I have lived in Christchurch all of my life, and it truly is a wonderful city to call home.  But, as Heavenly Creatures points out, it is also home to one of the biggest scandals in New Zealand history.

The murder of Honora Parker raised many eyebrows during the winter of 1954.  Firstly because she was murdered by her daughter Pauline, and Pauline's best friend Juliet.  Secondly because it was discovered after the murder that Honora was not actually 'married' to her husband Mr Rieper.  Even though she went about her life as Honora Rieper, she was hiding a mini scandal of her own (in 1950's New Zealand life).

The day of the murder was 22 June 1954, and it was an unseasonably warm day during what had otherwise been a very cold winter.  It was so warm in fact that many people skipped work or school and headed outdoors.  My own Grandmother took a 'day off' from work and actually spent the day in Victoria Park.  It wasn't until she returned home and turned on her radio that night that she had been at the Murder site that very day.

Peter Jackson does a wonderful job of capturing Christchurch in the 1950's and telling the shocking but true story of Parker and Hulme, and the desires that drove them to murder Honora.  While the city has changed much since 1954, there are still many reminders from the story of Parker and Hulme.  Both family homes still stand, as does the former High School and former University, as portrayed in the movie.  Victoria Park continues to be a popular picnic spot - and no other notable crimes have ever been committed there.

From a historical standpoint, this movie makes for great viewing.  Includes archival news footage and features many of New Zealands most talented actors - such as Melanie Lynsky.",1123718400,7,1750,4.6
646297,5,6303433766,"What can I say about this movie?  It really touched me.  It's about two girls, Juliet and Pauline, who become friends and face several hardships which eventually lead them to murder one of their parents.  There's more to it then that though.  The two girls, they make up their own world, with their own characters with their own rules.  They eventually depend on each other.  I guess what gets to me about the film is about how real it felt.  What the girls do, they run around, play about, write stories, idolize the teen idols of the day (Including Mario Lanza and James Mason.  Orson Wells is excluded from their idols because Juliet calls him hideous.), they way they interact with each reminds me of what I do with my friends, and that one friend in particual.  Of course, I'm 15 the age of these girls so I relate to them much more then an adult would, I believe.  It's a darker tone film with some quirky effects that one expects from Peter Jackson.  Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey give stunning performances, especially since this was their film debut.  It doesn't contain the gore that one would expect considering Jackson's previous works like Braindead and Bad Taste, but there is one murder scene but it's truly chilling, ranking up there with one of the worse murders to be filmed, on my own opinion.  I love this film to death and it makes me cry every time I see it.  It just feels, so real.  Even when clay figures come to life in the girl's fantasy, it doesn't seem to break any barriers, it feels with in reach of reality.

I highly reccomend at least one viewing.  If you're under 18 you may find a few things hit a bit closer to home then you'd like...",1121731200,5,1674,4.436065573770492
646298,3,6303433766,"HEAVENLY CREATURES is one of the films Peter Jackson directed before he reached superstar status with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Jackson gives us a bizarre, insightful, but ultimately, dissatisfying look at two young girls who think murder is the answer to all of their problems.  Knowing that one of the girls (Juliet) grew up to be acclaimed mystery novelist Anne Perry adds a sense of irony.  Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet give flawless performances, eliciting that awkward innocence of youth, but their chilling deviousness in plotting the murder of Lynskey's mother gives an underlying chill to this innocence.  Jackson's fantasy scenes are marvelous, presaging his finesse to come.  But can one really sympathize with these two girls?  I didn't...Lynskey's mother is nothing more than a concerned mother who has a right to question her daughter's rebellious behavior...she is no more callous or harsh than any one's mother.  The brutal murder comes after a painstakingly deliberate pace which adds an even more hideous reaction to these young girl's actions.  From a filmmaking standpoint, HEAVENLY CREATURES is exceptionally well done, but for entertainment value, it's hard to be entertained by such self-centered youngsters.",1120262400,10,1241,5.393782383419689
646299,5,6303433766,"Sometimes a director cuts scenes for a reason. Although this DVD is the ""uncut"" version, the original theatrical release is highly preferable in that it excludes scenes that really add nothing to the story (watch some well-known films, such as Apocalypse Now, and it's usually the case that the deleted scenes more often than not bog down the narrative). The extra scenes here in this DVD serve only to impede the excellent pacing and relentless build-up to the chilling conclusion. And the final frame of a bloodied Parker detracts from the original cut's ending. The original depiction is quite powerful enough and better conveys her anguish and total despair. This 'uncut' ending only serves to focus attention on the murder itself instead of the overall emotional  consequences of her actions and the pair's final separation.

Be that as it may, Heavenly Creatures is still one of my all-time favorite films. If only they'd offer a DVD with BOTH versions!",1119398400,6,959,5.0251572327044025
646300,2,6303433766,"The first thirty minutes of this movie are by far its strongest: we see the oppressive and provincial girls' Catholic school being turned upside down by the arrival of a worldly and precocious outsider, Kate Winslet in her trademark finest spunky form.

After that the next 30 minutes are spent elaborating on how much Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey develop an intense codependency on each other, as a natural result of Winslet's traumatic childhood and emotionally distant parents, and Lynskey's deep insecurities as a result of her looks and class.  Kind of your typical pretty-girl-ugly-girl combination, to put it bluntly.  They pretty much create an incredibly vivid and powerful fantasy world that they inhabit together, and which will propel them towards the murder and mayhem of the last 30 minutes of the movie.

I bailed out with about 25 minutes left to go because by that time it was painfully obvious what was going to happen, and if there's one thing I really cannot stand, it's a painfully predictable and obvious movie especially one involving a long downhill slide that you can see coming a thousand miles away...King Lear type stuff.  However I was already starting to get restless about 45 minutes into the movie...I stayed longer mainly to finish the very good bottle of wine I'd opened, LOL!

You can sort of see Peter Jackson's talent in all the fantasy scenes which he brings to another level in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also Kate Winslet's onscreen charisma (this was her film debut apparently) which continues to make her one of my favorite actresses.  The cast is pretty much flawless, the film is well shot---but all those factors simply cannot save a fairly dull and commonplace plot that really would be better suited for some Made-For-TV movie, not a real feature film.",1111363200,9,1811,4.918032786885246
646301,5,6303433766,"Pauline Rieper (New Zealand native Melanie Lynskey, ""Sweet Home Alabama"")has a dull and unhappy life at home with her family. And since none of the other girls at school understand her, she has no friends. The Hulme family moves in town from England, and their daughter Juliet (Winslet, who won the part over 175 other girls) clicks instantly with Pauline, especially since the girls share a love of literature and fantasy. In their creative minds, they begin to write about a ficticious world they want to be in; these parts of the film are shown with life-size versions of the clay model characters they make. Juliet and Pauline are inseperable, mainly because Juliet's wealthy parents always seem to be trying to ditch her, and Pauline is humiliated by her father and suffocated by her mother. But the girls parents, particularly Pauline's mother, begin to notice bizarre behavior from them, and decide that they need to see less of each other.  What else are two disturbed girls to do but conspire to kill the person that wants to keep them apart?

Not only is this a true story, it came out in 1994, while Jackson (""Lord of the Rings"" fame) was filming this, that Juliet Hulme was actually mystery novel writer Anne Perry. Pauline Rieper was tracked down in 1997 in a run down cottage, apparently living under the name Hilary Nathan, and has since become a devout Catholic who spends her time helping handicapped children. Aparrently, they were eventually released from prison under the condition that they never see each other again. Jackson has an uncredited cameo, playing a bum that gets kissed by Winslet's character outside a theatre. All of the journal voice-overs are direct from real diary entries made by Pauline Rieper. Also, almost all locations used for filming were the genuine locations where the events occurred. The tea shop where Honorah Parker ate her last meal was knocked down a few days after the shoot ended. According to Jackson, when they got to the location of the murder on the dirt path, it was eerily quiet; the birds stopped singing, and it didn't seem right. So they moved along a couple of hundred yards. Fascinating movie; no DVD extras, but there is another 10 minutes or so of footage not seen in the original cut.",1098316800,16,2254,4.806701030927835
646302,5,6303433766,"Jackson's fiery screenplay and stunning dreamscape  montages became eerily real when I read on the closing credits that it was all based on the real diaries of one its adoloscent protagonists.

It is a difficult story of filial murder -- two sisters so devoutly in love with each other that they would go any lengths to stick together, including murdering their own mother --  but the film captures it with unsparing sharpness, deeply disturbing in its potrayal of the whims of the human mind.

Apart from that surface theme, Heavenly Creatures also hints at deeper issues. There is a strong attraction between the two girls, and the film doesn't fudge the glint of lesbianism. In fact in its mocking treatment of the adults who try to label their friendship as ""unwholesome"", the film urges us to look beyond any tidy summaries.

It is also refreshing to see a director respecting the complexity of each character's obsessions; the murderers are not necessarily driven by deliberate evil, but victims of turbulent imaginations themselves. Despite their crazy behaviour, we end up empathizing with them as well as the mother. In this regard, the three central performances by  Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet and Sarah Peirse are simply riveting.

Jackson is now known for his 'Lord of the Ring' histrionics. The imagery in this film tells us why he reached that pinnacle.

The DVD sadly is a bit sparse, devoid of the special features a film of this cadre so richly deserves, but the film itself is a pulse-pounding must-see of a murder yarn. Recommended in a blink.",1094688000,3,1565,4.923954372623574

646304,5,6303433766,"It still amazes me how Peter Jackson went on to direct three of the greatest epics in the form of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" that grossed a combined total of $3 billion worldwide when some six years previously directed low-budget films such as ""Heavenly Creatures."" They say the best things happen by accident (or is that just me?) and just two and a half hours ago I was flicking through the channels, looking for something to watch when I stumbled amongst Heavenly Creatures. Dubbed by my TV guide as an 'intense and atmospheric treat,' I decided to sit and watch it, if not only for the adorable Kate Winslet. By the end I was convinced I had just watched one of the best films I have seen in years!
In 1954 two girls brutally murdered one of their mothers in what still remains, to this day, perhaps the most documented and sensational murders in New Zealand's history. ""Heavenly Creatures"" tells the true story of this crime drama and highlights their strange friendship. If you think before you watch this that you're just in for another stereotypical blood-splatter flick then you are very much mistaken.
Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a typical student in a strict all-girls' school who is completely bowled over when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) joins her school and tears up her pathetic existence into something radical and fresh. They have similar interests such as the arts, sculpture, English and the tenor Mario Lanza. Eventually both the romance and the frightfulness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion. In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a ""Fourth World,"" better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.
The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense, so that they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality for them. Not even a four-month stint in hospital for Juliet can keep Pauline away. Pauline drops out of school and stops talking to her parents; Juliet learns that her mother is sleeping with one of her clients, and that her parents are divorcing. Now she's being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together...such as murder.
Watching the film I felt a continual underbelly of lesbianism playing a major role. These suggestions are continually squashed, however, due to the times the movie is set in where homosexuality is an 'unnatural' subject. Kate Winslet is superb as the bright and luminous Juliet and with her posh accent, she brings a certain level of humor to the film that would have been impossible without her. Melanie Lynskey portrays Pauline superbly too, contrasting from the mature attitude of a fully grown woman to the sly grin of an evil teenage girl who knows too much. The films comedy moment can be cheesy at times, but are intentional in their positions in that they counterbalance the horrifying scenes. Many moments pre-horror build up the suspense brilliantly, then perform a sort of anticlimax. However, the peaceful and tranquil music that plays just before the brutal and obscene ending is obviously intentful.
The ending is what stays with the viewer most when looking back on the film The way Jackson directed the scene to be something truly spectacular was superbly pulled off. The screams of the mother and the cuts to the alternative-world made me want to cover my eyes in fear, but I persisted and watched through the horror. The dialogue of the film is brilliant, and only Peter Jackson could come up with the idea of life-size clay models that walk and talk. Six years later he'd be making something a lot grander. Richard Taylor supplies the CGI effect and is superb in doing so making for surprisingly life-like, realistic characters - remember, this was 1994!
In the end what you have here is a fantastic and timeless film that is perfect for college/University studies both in direction and content. What is most fascinating, apart from the real-life chilling theme that features prominently throughout, is the fact that Peter Jackson went on to become one of the world's most celebrated directors in history, whilst Kate Winslet went on to star in the most successful motion picture of all time! This is a film that will appeal to all generations (obviously not youngsters) of people with a thirst for crime, horror, blood, gore and fantasy.

It was fairly sensual in places, which surprised me; given that there was little, if any nudity, although according to Craig Hosada, of the book ""The Bare Facts Guide"" there is, but it's brief, and may have been ""lost"" to ""modification"" for the smaller screen.  This doesn't detract too much from very emotional performances, by Winslet and Lynskey, [which made there characters very sad, at times, as they yelled and cried a lot] but also made them strangely sympathetic.  Winslet was clearly the more ""sophisticated"" one, but Ms. Lynskey held her own, as the plain[er] looking, but equally strange, highly emotional, young woman.

  Peter Jackson does some gracious wasting of celluloid by showing us ethereal dancing scenes that contribute zilch to the plot. Whenever he runs out of choreography he throws in some hallucinatory visuals hoping this will distract ya from asking ""hey, dude, where's my movie?"", but, nonetheless ""Heavenly creatures"" remains a draggy affair with only one huge positive: it only lasts a merciful one and a half hour..

""Heavenly Creatures"" tells the strange story of these two girls and their unique relationship. If you think this is just a reality based splatter flick, then you are going to be much more than surprised and impressed by what Jackson has accomplished.
Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a simple and rather dull young girl who is totally dazzled when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) enters her life. Juliet is impressed as well, because Pauline has a scar on her leg from an operation. Juliet declares that: ""All the best people have had chest and bone disease! It's all frightfully romantic!""

In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a ""Fourth World,"" better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.
Jackson brings this fantasy world alive, which allows him to explore the pivotal theme of juxtaposition throughout the film. This comes into play most notably at the beginning and ending of ""Heavenly Clouds."" Jackson begins with a 1950s newsreel about Christchurch, New Zealand, which is interrupted by the appearance of the two screaming and bloodied girls, thereby symbolizing the way this sensational case shocked the nation. Even more effective is the film's conclusion, where the murder is inter-cut with what the girls think will happen if they do not find this way of saving themselves.
With any film based on historical events there are omissions, alterations, substitutions, and the like, and ""Heavenly Creatures"" is no different. On the plus side of the ledger Jackson attempted an almost morbid verisimilitude. Almost all of the locations used for filming were the real locations where events occurred, including the tea shop where Honora Parker ate her last meal, which was torn down a few days after the shooting ended. However, the cast and crew found the actual murder scene uncomfortable and moved further down the path. All of the journal voice-overs come directly from Pauline's diary, as are the characters in the girls' make-believe world. However, since the two filled up fifteen notebooks and hundreds of letters devoted to their fantasies, the movie actually underplays these elements.
However, having familiarized myself somewhat with the actual ""facts"" of the case, and the recollections of the woman one of the girls grew up to be, the key point of dispute is the motive. But if Jackson is guilty of becoming fixated on the idea that these two young girl committed a murder because they could not bear to be separated and have their fantasy world unravel, then he can be hardly faulted for finding that a fascinating interpretation of the evidence (the girls never testified or were examined in court, but Pauline's diary was seen as providing all the answers). More importantly, Jackson does not seem guilty of taking gratuitous liberties.  Instead he is offering a valid interpretation of the evidence. For example, the murder sequence greatly reduces the number of blows, but the effect is still horrific where the sounds alone can force you to shut your eyes, so it seems trivial to complain about any inaccuracy given the scene's effectiveness.
From an artistic standpoint Jackson's interpretation is more than justified, especially at the end. In addition to the information we receive between the final scene and the closing credits that tells what happened to Pauline and Juliet, Marzio Lanza sings ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" which is as perfect a choice of a song to play at the end of a film as you will ever hear, forcefully underscoring the film's thesis. Jackson says this is ""a murder story about love, a murder story with no villains,"" and it is hard to argue with this idea after watching his film.
""Heavenly Creatures"" received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Jackson and Frances Walsh. The film won every award for which it was nominated in the New Zealand Film and TV Awards, including Best Actress for Lynskey and Best Foreign Performer for Winslet (both of whom were perfectly suited for those roles), and earned film festival awards in Venice and Toronto. This is a striking and unforgettable film, both creative and thoughtful.

646362,5,6303433766,"For those who wondered how the director of ""Bad Taste"" and ""Brain Dead"" got to direct ""The Lord of the Rings,"" this 1994 film from director Peter Jackson supplies the answer.  In 1954 two teenage girls brutally murdered one of the their mothers in what must be the most sensational murder in New Zealand history.  ""Heavenly Creatures"" tells the strange story of these two girls and their unique relationship.  If you think this is just a reality based splatter flick, then you are going to be much more than surprised and impressed by what Jackson has accomplished.
Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a simple and rather dull young girl who is totally dazzled when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) enters her life.  Juliet is impressed as well, because Pauline has a scar on her leg from an operation.  Juliet declares that: ""All the best people have had chest and bone disease! It's all frightfully romantic!""  Eventually both the romance and the frightfullness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion.  In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a ""Fourth World,"" better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.

646363,3,6303433766,"Heavenly Creatures is a dark tale of two very disturbed young women, a showcase of their intense bond and their slow tip over the edge.  Together they create a fantasy world which soon outpaces their dull and often oppressive reality (New Zealand in the '50s).  Peter Jackson shows respect for their fantasies and handles their relationship with a surprising delicacy, all the while leading us down the dark path to evil:  a brutal murder in cold blood.  Kate Winslet provides a believable if somewhat smug interpretation; Melanie Lynskey's characterization is a bit one-sided; but they work well together.

646364,5,6303433766,"I watched this film because I enjoyed FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and TWO TOWERS and think that Peter Jackson is a talented director.  I wanted to see more of his work in another genre.
HEAVENLY CREATURES is a wonderful and complex film.  Jackson (and cowriter Fran Walsh) takes what could be a salacious story (homosexuality, sex, and murder) and makes an amazingly surreal and touching film.  After the shootings in Columbine and other dastardly acts - including the two real-life New Zealand girls who are the subject of this story - Jackson gets into the state of mind of the youth.  The two New Zealand girls (played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) are too consumed by their fantasy world to know right from wrong.  They are young and confused and their best recourse is their imaginations (incredible sequences with life-size clay people!).
Jackson has created a very theatrical world in HEAVENLY CREATURES.  There are some hilarious filmatic references (including some funny bits about Orson Wells).  The characters are complex, though.  Jackson and Walsh made me understand WHY the girls chose to do what they did -- which doesn't make it right.  But the film makes no moral judgment (which I appreciate!), it only tells the girls' story.
The DVD looks very good, with an excellent transfer of the film (although I noticed some scratches running down the right side of the frame in the early scenes!).
I'm glad I finally saw HEAVENLY CREATURES.  I'm convinced Peter Jackson is one of our best directors around.",1052092800,13,1518,4.91764705882353
646365,5,6303433766,"""How can these heavenly creatures be real?"" asks Pauline in one scene of ""Heavenly Creatures,"" the exquisite and horrifying docudrama of a real-life murder in New Zealand. Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effect, great actors, and outstanding direction to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.

In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. They share a love of the arts, writing, sculpting, drawing, fantasy, and tenor Mario Lanza. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable, spinning their fantastical tales of castles, knights, unicorns and beautiful ladies. (The foremost ladies, Deborah and Gina, are modelled on themselves) Even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies. But soon Juliet's father (Clive Merrison) becomes concerned that their close friendship is ""unhealthy."" It is, but not just in the way he thinks.

The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense, so that they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality for them . Pauline drops out of school and stops talking to her parents; Juliet learns that her mother is sleeping with one of her clients, and that her parents are divorcing. Now she's being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.

Peter Jackson kicks off ""Heavenly Creatures"" by emphasizing what a beautiful, in most ways peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary). But he rapidly shows that beauty is not everything  -- the complex and beautiful fantasy land of Borovnia has a sort of amorality in its stories, that reflects the girls' own minds. Their mothers are problematic -- one is selfish, the other is controlling -- but the girls begin to see them as mere obstacles to be dealt with. Jackson doesn't just show what the two did, but showed why they did it. But even then, he doesn't sugarcoat anything.

Melanie Lynskey is excellent as Pauline; she has something of the look of both a child and a woman, switching between smiles and sullenness, depending on who she's speaking to. And the luminous Kate Winslet plays the somewhat devil-may-care Juliet, whose vivacity and charm overrule any of Pauline's reservations. ""It's everyone else who's bonkers!"" she says gleefully when Pauline casts doubt on her own sanity. The supporting actors are also good, especially Clive Merrison and Honora Peirse as Juliet's dad and Pauline's mom, who are both concerned about their children.

The dialogue is outstanding, both chilling and simple (""Our main idea for the day was to murder Mother""; ""we decided to use a rock in a stocking, rather than a sandbag..."").  And Richard Taylor's handling of the CGI and prosthetics is oustanding. One particularly vivid scene has a hillside transforming into an exquisite garden. And nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies, but somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story. Jackson's unique camerawork is here as well; if you enjoy his swooping shots and close-ups, then this will be a treat to watch.

 The DVD is pretty bare-bones, unfortunately, without a ""making of"" or director's commentary -- or much of a look at the real-life events of this film. There are some trailers for other movies, and the trailer for this one as well. (Which is not so amazing because it wobbles a little as it played)

While Juliet went on to become bestselling murder mystery writer Anne Perry, no one is entirely certain what happened to Pauline. This movie is frighteningly vivid, beautifully made, and exquisitely directed, destined to  be a modern classic.",1050624000,68,3973,5.078220858895706
646366,4,6303433766,"I would like to discuss a movie we enjoyed last night that has a strong tie-in with Mario Lanza, namely the 1994 film set in New Zealand,""Heavenly Creatures"". This is based on the true story of two adolescent girls who become best friends and eventually develop an obsession with each other while living in the fantasy world they create. They worship Mario Lanza, the man and his music, and throughout the film the viewer is treated to many fine songs and Lanza visuals. First you hear ""Be My Love"" as Pauliine plays it on her parent's Hi-Fi (this was 1952..no stereo yet!). (Inaccuracy: she pulls the black labelled LP out of the famous red Student Prince cover!) Later, they find ""Cavalcade of Show Tunes"" at Juliet's house and another black label record falls onto the turntable playing the first cut of ""Donkey Serenade"". (Inaccuracy..wrong song!) Still later, there is a delightful sequence involving dancing and romping the countryside to ""Funiculi, Funicula"". (Innacuracy: he hadn't recorded this cut from the Mario! album yet) Then a young man dressed like Lanza in Great Caruso lip syncs to ""Loveliest Night of the Year"". We see photos of Mario hanging in the girls' bedrooms, see large poster of ""Great Caruso"", and even see a life sized animated singing clay Mario. Also, there are many references to Lanza throughout...""the greatest tenor in the world"", etc.! Great funny line from a father, who says: ""Mari O'Lanza...an Irishman, not an Italian"". Mario sings ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" during the end credits.
The British film is wonderfully photographed and has brilliant directorial touches from Peter Jackson. It's an enjoyable movie, but deals with serious issues as murder, lesbianism, etc., and consequently feels rather odd.
The quality of the sound is excellent on the DVD with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. The picture quality is also excellent and is especially appealing in widescreen. Hope anyone interested gets to enjoy it as well!",1047600000,2,1952,5.065217391304348
646442,5,6303433766,"Taking place in the 1950's in Christchurch New Zealand. Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story about the intense bond of two girls Pauline Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme.
I think for Pauline in particular this friendship is very important. Pauline is moody person, an introvert of very strong character, kind of a tom boy, with short black unruly curls.
Her father runs a fish shop, and her mother is a house wife, their working-class home also doubles as a boarding house.
She may have feelings of inadequetcy, because of scars on her legs, leaving them brittle, from a childhood illness. But when she meets Juliet Hulme it seems she's met her soul mate.
Juliet is an extrovert, worldly and outspoken, she even corrects the French teacher on her first day.
Juliet is impressed with Pauline's scars, she has scars too, on her lungs from a childhood bout with tuberculosis.
Juliet's parents left her in the Bahamas ""for the good of her health"" and she didn't see them for five whole years. Juliet tells Pauline ""All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases, it's all frightfully romantic!""
Pauline finds refuge at Juliet's enormous upper-class house, where they play and obsess in their made-up world of Borovnia, they write about the escapades of their imaginary alter egos and their fantasy family. Juliet becomes Deborah and Pauline becomes Gina (a beautiful gypsy). and they revel in the music of Mario Lanza, the worlds greatest tenor!
But Juliets parents seem rather cold and aloof. Her mother is a marriage counselor, she has a special technique called ""deep therapy"".
And her father is an esteemed University rector. He is the first to question the intensity of Pauline and Juliet's relationship. He suggests to the Riepers that Pauline may be growing in a ""wayward"" fashion and suggests a psychiatrist.
However, Pauline seems oblivious to this. She thinks of Mr. Hulme. as the kindest man she's ever known.
Pauline begins to grow desperate, at the idea that someone may try to come in between her and Juliet, particularly her mother. Who seems to grow concerned at Pauline's total obsession with her stories (and uninterest in school) and especially after a short affair with a male boarder, their relationship is rocky.
Whereas Pauline truly has loving parents, her friendship with Juliet is so important to her, it seems to have altered her reality. And the tension builds when Juliet's parrents announce they are getting divorced and Mr. Hulme is taking Juliet and her brother to South Africa.
The story is absolutely true.
The narration of the film was taken directly from the actual diaries entries of Pauline, which was discovered buried in her backyard by the police. And Peter Jackson, said he filmed most of the scenes in the actual location of the real events.
Melanie Lynsky who portrays Pauline, is MAGNIFICENT! Her performance in fantastic, and seems so real.
Those scenes in which she cries, are so excruiating to watch, because she's actually sobbing, and at the same time it's just facinating.
She's also very charming. I think you'll like her right away.
Kate Winslet is also wonderful. This must have been he first film for each of them, because in the opening sequence is says ""and introducing Melanie Lynsky & Kate Winslet""
Filmed in Christchurch New Zealand, Heavenly Creatures is a FACINATING and an absolutely ENGROSSING film. If you like movie of ""dark"" genre, you'll be awe-struck.
As an interesting side note, The girls were spared harsh punishment because of their ages. Juliet Hulme, changed her name to Anne Perry and is now a writer (of fictional crime) Anne Perry herself admits this. There has been speculation as to what has become of Pauline. But one source says, she changed her name to Hilary Nathan and is an ex-librarian, devout Catholic (almost became a nun) and now runs a riding school in rural England. This is from NZ (New Zealand) Woman's Weekly magazine 1997 in an article written by Chris Cooke.
This is an excellent film, and I'm glad to see it's now on DVD, I know there was a petition going around to get it released, I signed it. :-)

646443,4,6303433766,"The last Peter Jackson film before he took on the monumental task of Lord of the Rings, Heavenly Creatures is a superb examination of the true story of two teenage girls who's friendship turns into a romance and its resulting deadly consequences in 1950's New Zealand.
 At the heart of the friendship lies the girl's common interest in fantasy. As evident through Jackson's other films, the director shows his similar interest by illustrating their fantasy world as they become closer. Strong macabre themes run through the film, as you simultaneously root for the girls? relationship and against what you know they eventually plan to do. Jackson skillfully balances this to create a mesmerizing film that you can't take your eyes off until the bloody end.
Acting all around is note perfect, especially with the two girls played by Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in her first film role. Everything works perfectly here to capture your attention. It?s clear how Jackson earned approval to make the risky Lord of the Rings project, because for the first time here, he shows how he can be a serious filmmaker with a load of talent.

Melanie Lynskey is especially good as lower middle class Pauline/Yvonne,Gina. The use of music and the fantasy sequences effectively show the over the top emotional states these girls were in. The relationship starts out innocently. In fact, Pauline is so miserable, it seems like Juliet is the best thing that has ever happened to her and then everything spirals out of control.
The final and best sequence has almost no dialoge--just the delicate music of the Humming Chorus from Madame Butterfly as Pauline's plodding, simple mother walks unwittingly to her death like a cow to the slaugher house.

Although 'Heavenly Creatures' predates 'Sense', I viewed 'Heavenly Creatures' afterwards.  This performance proved to me that Ms. Winslet is one of the most capable actresses of my/our generation.
Lastly, this was my introduction into the mind of Peter Jackson, the director who would later give us 'The Lord of the Rings.'  The fact that this is also based on a true story gives additional credit to the director's vision -- Mr. Jackson was able to weave the harsh reality bits with the fantastic journeys into these teens' imaginations in a very convincing fashion.

They don't really seem to have anyone but each other.  To help deal with this, they create a fantasy world, first in words and books, then with clay.  And all the while it's active in their mind.  They escape into this world called Borovnia and into each other.  When Juliet (played by the incredible Kate Winslet) comes down with another bout of tuberculosis, she's quarentined in a hospital and the separation proves to be extremely difficult for Juliet and Pauline.  But the real test comes when Juliet is to be shipped out of the country.  That bit of separation is too much for the girls to handle and they go to desperate lengths to prevent it.  Whether or not they succeed, I won't say.
This movie is based in truth.  Much research can be done online as to the factual content of the movie.  Many people question if their friendship turned into any sort of lesbian relationship.  Other questions have been raised as well.  However, fact or fiction, this is one of the most incredible movies out there for viewing.  It's beautiful and breathtaking and something everyone should see.  I can't recommend it enough.",1018569600,4,1267,4.695454545454545
646511,5,6303433766,"When I heard Peter Jackson would be helming The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I knew it was in good hands, and that's based only on his work on HEAVENLY CREATURES. Jackson and Walsh was robbed of the Best Original Screenplay in 1995, the *only* Oscar nod this wonderful movie received.
HEAVENLY CREATURES was my favorite film of 1994. At the time, the ""hype"" was about the girls' ""homosexuality"". This completely missed the point. HEAVENLY CREATURES takes the true life story of murder and turns it into an engrossing and exasperating portrait of deep true love, love that defies all, love that shifts the world around you, love that most ""lovers"" never achieve. Despite the deadly outcome, one is envious of the love between these two girls. It is love that is exhuberant and defiant. The kind of love one can only dream to experience once in a lifetime.
The imaginary world of Pauline and Juliet is beautifully realized. The use of special effects is subtle and delightful, a true embedding of FX in the service of story and not because it ""looks cool"".
Since we know what the ultimate outcome is from the very beginning, the film doesn't play an ""ah-ha"". Instead it is all about showing us what is within the minds of these two girls and the relentless approach of the inevitable that drives the movie.
To echo what another reviewer said, HEAVENLY CREATURES is one of the few films that really stuck with me. Driving home in the dark, I kept muttering to myself 'Oh my god...' I was emotionally drained for several days afterward.",1018483200,11,1530,4.691449814126394
646512,5,6303433766,"When I watched this film first time, I had a very unpleasant feeling. Because of some scenes such as matricide and homosexual love, it was disturbing. However, as I watched this film again, I realized that I could see some things that I did not see at the first time. I began to see thing that are technical aspects of the film and disagreeable situations. In conclusion, I felt that this work is quite well made film. This work treats shocking materials but as this materials connect to fantasy of two girls in the middle of the film, it tone down intensity of the shocking. The notable features of this work are fantasy of two girls, and the beautiful music, which links girls s fantasy. Two girls like to hear Mario Lanzas song, and then they became to fall into their fantasy world. They gradually fell into the fantasy, so they could not distinguish between the reality and the fantasy and they began to look away their real life. Their friendship became to change into delicate feeling like a homosexual love. In this film, there is no direct expression about it, but I could feel it. After all, relationship of them made brutally murder of Paulines mother. This is the most impact part of the film. by the way, the director Peter Jackson made it not particularly impact. He showed it step by step to explain why they committed a murder. This film is related to many genres such as love, fantasy, horror and psychodrama. All characters are described delicately to be shown shift of their emotion. This film is different from previous works of Peter Jackson, as it talked about reality. Pauline and Juliet made an imaginary kingdom and various characters. They thought that their fantasy is more important than real life. Their fantasy became to change reality, it was just not a story and writings. Then their fantasy was completed in their dream. They could come true everything what they want in dream.  Peter Jackson expressed their dream in this film. He described what they dream and indecent affairs that they did to realize their dream in real life. However, the boundary between the real life and the fantasy is obscure. The actual and the dream do not turn their back, they grasp their hand. Therefore, this work is one of the films, which appear his specific feature, fantasy.",1016928000,,2292,4.71571072319202
646513,5,6303433766,"A unique masterpiece, which infuses ingenious camera techniques, solid acting, and a well-adapted script.  Stars Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in their film debuts.  Both show promise and this film is more Lynskey's than Winslet's, but Lynskey has yet to become a household name (she will sooner or later).  This film is based on the most celebrated trial in placid New Zealand, the Parker-Hulme case, which concerned the girls' murder of one of their mothers in the 1950's. What's intriguing about it is that one of the girls (Hulme) turns out to be the celebrated mystery writer, Anne Perry.
Winslet plays Juliet Hulme, an English debutante who moves to Christchurch, New Zealand when her father becomes the Rector of the town's college.  As a child she suffered from tuberculosis and like the stereotypical upper-crust English, her parents neglected her by abandoning her in the Caribbean.  She strikes up a friendship with the class wallflower, Pauline Parker, a girl of a lower socio-economic background, who also suffered from a childhood illness and felt outcast.  They soon become best friends and pursue their interests in writing stories and listening to opera to escape their mundane surroundings.  Scarily, their imagination takes over and they lose touch with reality.  Their emotional dependence on each other frightens their parents, who fear their daughters have developed homosexual feelings for each other.  As a solution, they attempt to separate the girls.  Juliet is to live in South Africa with her relatives and Pauline is not granted a passport.  The girls view Pauline's mother (Sarah Peirse) as the main obstacle of staying together.  They hatch a plan to kill her and make it look like an accident.
The director, Peter Jackson, presents the story from the girls' perspective.  The viewer is sucked into their visually rich fantasy-world, and one sympathizes with their plight.  One understands the girls' disillusionment with their parents, when Juliet discovers her mother (Diana Kent) is having an affair with a married man.  Pauline's parents, it is discovered during the trial, were never married.  In fact, her father was still legally married to his first wife.  Jackson, who understandably was the perfect director to direct Lord of the Rings, utilizes clay animation, timely editing and angular use of the camera.  And most important of all is the script, based mostly on Pauline Parker's diaries written during the two year period leading up to the horrifying crime.  The result is the most original film in decades.
FYI, the girls were released when they turned 21 years old on condition that they never meet.  Perry, who took her stepfather's surname, her stepfather being the man her mother was having an affair with, currently resides in Scotland.  Surprisingly and coincidentally, so does Parker, although they have yet to meet again.  They both are doing what they dreamed of when they met-Perry writing books and Parker riding horses (she runs a horseback riding academy).  Perry, who lived in the US for a number is years, is a devout Mormon and Parker is a devout Catholic.  They both eschewed religion as teenagers.",1016496000,21,3164,5.134765625
646602,5,6303433766,"Heavenly Creatures is one of the best movies of the '90s, especially for something based on a real life story.  It stars Kate Winslet (Titanic) and Melanie Lynskey (Ever After) as best friends who end up killing one of the girls' mothers.
It starts out with Melanie's character, the weird girl, who loves opera and worships a certain opera singer.  She ends up flirting with and sleeping with a man who stayed in her parents' boarding house.  She meets the new girl (played by Kate) and they realize that they both lead similar lives.  Both feel ignored by their parents.  Both were very sick as children.  Both feel kind of empty.  Both love opera.
Their friendship begins to blossom and under it, a forbidden love.  After Mel's character is diagnosed by a psychologist as a homosexual (this was from the 50s), her parents forbade her from seeing Kate's character for a while.
The two got back together and began to plot the murder of the mother of Mel's character.  At a very unsuspecting moment (for the mom), the two girls strike.
They thought that her death would allow them to be together forever, but it didn't.  The police found out what they had done (from a diary) and they were arrested.  They were both found guilty and sentenced.  One condition of their paroles--they could never see each other again.
Now, they lead somewhat normal lives as a writer (Kate's character) and, I believe, the other works with horses.

I have since purchased the video and watched it several times. It does not lose its power to delight, confound, amuse, shock and upset. Yet it is so exquisitely tasteful and empathetic of its subject - never exploitative or gratuitous.
The acting is outstanding, particularly Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet and Sarah Pierse. They are ably assisted by a magnificent script and virtuoso direction. The presentation is so audacious, so imaginitive, it borders on genius. Respect due to Peter Jackson, Frances Walsh and the rest of the team.

When I see this film, I think back to when I was 13 or 14 and how my best friend and I should have been separated much like the main characters in this film. Girls of this age, particularly intelligent &#8220;misfit&#8221; girls, entertain themselves in strange ways... creating completely imaginary worlds and elaborate stories about how they inhabit these worlds. They lose themselves in these worlds and succumb to a kind of psychosis. They cannot help it. Everything takes on this feeling of monumental importance and urgency. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey convey the fervor, the fever, the loss of all reason... perfectly. Winslet is particularly luminous in her role (which is undoubtedly why we have seen her ascend to the heights of film stardom in the years since this stunning debut).

646610,5,6303433766,"I will always wonder what I would have thought of HEAVENLY CREATURES had I seen it when it came out rather than now, after Columbine.  This film is based on the true story of two adolescent girls in New Zealand in the 1950s who kill the mother of one of them.  The crime was shocking and like latterday Americans, the New Zealanders must have staggered about saying, we just did not see it coming and how could two girls from nice families do this?  It is precisely that question that the filmmakers seek to answer and, in a very original way, succeed at.
The film follows the girls from the point they meet in the restrictive girls' school they attend to the moment of the crime.  In between it reveals two very intelligent misfits who are drawn to each other as if by a fierce law of physics.  Such is their affinity that they invent a fantasy world and inhabit it so intensely as to be able to envision exactly what the other sees in their minds.  Their bond and fantasies affect their judgment, throwing the usual excesses of emerging pubescence off kilter.  When events in their families' lives begin to insert themselves in such a way to threaten a separation of the two friends, they decide to remove the perceived obstacle in their path to togetherness.
It would have been safe to suggest the mystery of the fantasy world but this film shows it concretely.  The clay figures the girls fashion to depict their characters are seen coming to life so that the audience also sees what they see and share.  There is wit, too, in the depiction of the very normal aspects of the girls' experiences with school and families.  In the end, the power of the film comes in the realization that no one aspect of the girls' lives is any different or less sympathetic than the stuff of many coming of age stories, it's just that in this case they were sucked into a vortex so powerful that it knocked out all the emotional safety catches.  The line between angel and monster is a very thin one and that is very scary.  That one of the girls is revealed to have become a well-known, successful personage in her adulthood just adds to the perplexity.
All the artistic ducks are in a row behind this production.  Acting, direction, cinematography, sound: all check out.  Disturbing but fascinating.",989280000,11,2287,4.559902200488998
646611,5,6303433766,"Based on the true story of the relationship between Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) and Pauline Yvonne Parker/Reiper (Melanie Lynskey).
I believe there is too much emphasis placed on the actual murder of Pauline's mother, Honora Parker, even though the murder itself is why this movie was made. Although of course a very important aspect of the movie, it is not the movie entirely, and not the most important aspect of the girl's relationship. In essense, this is a story of two teenaged girls who quite literally fall in love with each other, and who live in a society (early 1950's New Zealand) which would not and could not cope with homosexuality. They began as friends, becoming so because they enjoyed the same things, namely the arts of all varieties. They liked each other because of their similarities, and as they both also enjoyed fantasy, they slowly created a fantasy world only they could enter and understand. I believe they created this fantasy world not only because they probably thought it exciting and a test for their very high intellects, but also because their world made them feel safe from society. Although homosexuality was hardly mentioned during that time - as Glamuzina and Laurie's book ""Parker & Hulme A Lesbian View"" discusses - the girls still knew the nature of their relationship would not be tolerated by society. A testament to this is referred to in Pauline's diary,(the movie is based in a large part on the writings), where she says something to the effect that she and Juliet could not sleep together on a particular night because they were afraid Juliet's father might walk in on them. They were best friends, and they were in love with each other; they shared a love that few could understand, and fewer have experienced because it was so pure and innocent. I believe that is why this movie has captivated so many people. They created their fantasy world in attempt to hide their love for each other from society, and even though they loved each other so deeply, when they slept together (as the movie shows), they started out pretending one or the other was a ""saint"", which was always a man, which helped them accept the act that they were engaging in; they did this because society's insinuation of 'this is wrong' was constantly in the back of their minds. The murder occured because the threat of being parted occured - they could not live without each other....
In the end, in Juliet's words: ""It's all frightfully romantic!""",989280000,6,2471,4.802816901408451
646664,4,6303433766,"The true story of two teenaged girls living in New Zealand in the early `50s, ""Heavenly Creatures,"" directed by Peter Jackson, is a riveting, sometimes intense drama that examines the fast friendship between Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), and the effects of that friendship, on not only themselves, but on their families and friends as well.  From a working class family, at fourteen, Pauline was shy and prone to introspection, recording her most intimate thoughts daily in a diary.  Originally from England, Juliet was the new girl in town; from a well-to-do family, she was well traveled, her father a professor of some stature.  Gregarious and outgoing, she was also given to flights of fancy, all of which appealed to Pauline immediately.  Brash and vivacious, Juliet was everything Pauline would never be; and Pauline was writing a novel, an endeavor in which Juliet quickly joined her.  Together, they would write and act out their romantic notions of brave knights and fair ladies, and Juliet shared with Pauline her knowledge of ""The Fourth World,"" a place to which she would one day go instead of heaven.  By the time they were fifteen, they were virtually inseparable.  They were ""best"" friends in every sense of the word.
 Director Jackson does a magnificent job of taking you into the world of Pauline and Juliet.  By contrasting the reality with the fantasy, he gives you an excellent sense of what they were all about, how they related to one another (as well as to others), and most importantly, their collective mind set which enabled them to actually embark upon their chosen path.  the girls' dream world is presented with a lyrical style that makes the happy times uplifting, and enhances the impact when things turn dark.  Throughout the film, passages are read verbatim from Pauline's diaries, which adds such stark realism to the events as they unfold, that in the end it produces a veritable sense of awe.  To see the things depicted here in a movie is one thing, but when you stop and think about the fact that two such ""normal"" young girls were capable of doing what they did, it is indeed sobering.  And when you learn what finally became of Pauline and Juliet, it merely adds to the incredulity of it all.
 This film marked the screen debuts of Winslet and Lynskey, and in Winslet's case, this film could have been subtitled ""A Star Is Born.""  From the opening frames, in which her talent, beauty and charismatic screen presence are readily apparent, there was no doubt as to the direction her career would soon be taking.  In retrospect, this was a great role with which to jump start her career, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands and created a truly memorable character, using her natural poise and charm to the ultimate effect.  Winslet not only played the character, she discovered the spirit that moved Juliet and used it to the fullest extent to bring her to life here.  It's a genuinely auspicious and incredible performance.
 That Lynskey hasn't fared as well in her career as Winslet has since this film was made is in no way a reflection upon her performance in it.  Pauline is perfectly realized by Lynskey, but due to the more solemn nature of the character, it was almost as if she was predestined to be overshadowed here by Winslet.  But the credit for making the on screen relationship between the girls work so well, and the fact that it is so believable, has to be distributed equally between the two actresses.  And it was Lynskey's ability to evoke and surround herself with an ambience of darkness that allowed Winslet's light to shine so brightly.
 The supporting cast includes Sarah Peirse (Honora), Diana Kent (Hilda), Clive Merrison (Henry), Simon O'Connor (Herbert), Jed Brophy (John), Peter Elliott (Bill), Gilbert Goldie (Dr. Bennett) and Kirsti Ferry (Wendy).  Watching such extraordinary circumstances being played out so matter-of-factly by such seemingly ordinary people can be a thought provoking experience, but in the case of ""Heavenly Creatures,"" it's profoundly disturbing.  There's nothing quite so jarring as realizing the facility with which certain boundaries can in fact be traversed, and when it happens, it's like a slap in the face from reality.  And that's what this film does.  It's an engrossing tale that will prick up the hairs on your neck of awareness, and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark.",987292800,4,4435,4.902275769745649

I loved this film because I felt left out at school, still dreaming about magicalthings, and fed up because i wasn't one of the girls who heard the word 'fantasy' and burst into high-pitched giggles. Juliet is a character some girls may sympathise with-the spoilt, parentally starved young snob who is used to getting her  own way no matter what, but I relate to Paul, living in a simple, strict family system where you work for a living, and she yearsn to break free and realise her own mind. I think the scenes of Borovnia, the plasticene kingdom, were a bit bland and boring though, and the castle and its many people seemed a bit restricted-there could have been more work there. I also think there should have been more tantalising glimpses of the 'Fourth World' not just an English garden and big butterfly's.

Peter Jackson's film takes as its starting point the real-life murder committed by two teenage girls in Christchurch, New Zealand in the 1950s, but transforms it into a brilliant meditation on the role of escapism and fantasy in daily life and their sometimes devastating consequences. The film takes you into the bizarre Brontsque fantasy worlds of the two young women, Pauline Rieper and Juliet Hulme, as they come to turn to each other for support against the dreadful realities of adolescence and their parents' unhappy lives, and allows you to feel their mounting intensity of hysteria as their dreamworld spins out of control. Lynsket is remarkable as Pauline, but the real find in this film was Winslet, whose ripe beauty only enhances her complex portrayal of Julie, replete with all the paradoxical sensuality and innocence, charm and spitefulness, of a young woman on the verge of adulthood but avoiding the responsibilities it will entail.

It's hard to imagine her fleshing out such an emotionally crippled character which she does with remarkable effectiveness and will make it very hard for me to critize her acting ability again.

This is teen  escapism carried to the nth degree.  Innocence and wholesome fun do NOT  prevail.  As the parents grow increasingly concerned about their daughters'  obsessive relationship, the girls begin to hate the parents...  Based on a  rather shocking (for its time) true story.
Kate Winslet made her film  debut in this modest com&eacute;die noire from way down under.  It is amazing to  realize that three years later she starred in the Academy Award winning  Titanic (1997), on her way to establishing herself as one of the most  charismatic and talented stars of the past decade.  In retrospect, her  budding talent is apparent here as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who  went off the deep end emotionally.  There is no mistaking the sharp,  confident and commanding Winslet style.  Despite the part, Kate looks as  wholesome and delicious as apple pie with cherry vanilla ice cream, yet  manages to convey the demented edge necessary to the role.
Full-figured  and brooding Melanie Lynskey is intriguing and not easily forgotten as  Kate's manic/depressive friend.

While those are wonderful films of their type, no one could have predicted  that he would go on to create a masterpiece of modern cinema like Heavenly  Creatures.  This is the kind of film that makes you realize how  imaginatively impoverished most other movies are.  I was shocked to  recently find out that the American version is about 15 minutes shorter  than the New Zealand release.  Here's hoping that this unique film will  someday be available in the U.S. in its full-length, original version and  letterboxed on DVD.  Soon!",961027200,4,679,4.973214285714286

The fact this is a true story only  underscores that. It's a very twisted love story, but one none the  less.
This film will make you feel a lot of different emotions when  watching it. Both love and hate for the two main characters, a constant  feel of uneasiness, especially when they go into their fantasy world, among  others.
The ending of this film gets me like no other film I've yet seen.  You despise the girls for what they do. It's amazing how one evil act  transforms your feeling for the girls.
Most disgusting to me, is how real  life Juliet Hulme, has gone on to make millions of dollars a  myster  writer. Some justice, eh?
All-in-all, HC is probably in my top 5 movies  for the 90's. Hopefully we'll be getting a feature ladden, widescreen DVD  soon.",960940800,,944,4.553571428571429

Peter Jackson (now deservedly directing ""Lord of the Rings"" in New Zealand) put one  of the most remarkable, beautiful, frightening, and tragic love stories on  celluloid with this movie, and should be forever honored. The relationship  between Juliet and Pauline gets handled with joy and exuberance, with a  gradually increasing amount of uneasiness and dread. The handling of  emotions in this movie is a triumph. Those who enjoy a good laugh should  check out his ""Dead Alive.""  While this movie is usually  mentioned in articles as ""Kate Winslet's first"" its main  attraction (without dissing Ms. Winslet at all) is unquestionable Melanie  Lynskey, one of the most talented actresses out there (pretty much my  favorite) and also one of the most unjustly neglected.

646719,5,6303433766,"'Heavenly Creatures' is the true story of two school girls in Christchurch, New Zealand who murder one of their mothers when the two families plan to separate them.
Juliet Hulme and Pauline Rieper (later  revealed in the trial to be Pauline Parker, as her parents never married)  quickly become best friends when Juliet's family moves to Christchurch in  1952. Pauline's family is working class; Juliet is a high-class girl.  They're both lonely and creative. Their friendship becomes more obsessive  and surreal every day, as they mix reality and fantasy: They create a  kingdom called Borovnia, where bloodspill is common and Mario Lanza and  Orson Welles make appearances. It is to this world they retreat when they  wish to forget the upsets and pains of real life. Juliet and Pauline's  parents soon enough become the enemies of the girls, when they plan to  separate the girls. Juliet and Pauline will do anything to stay together,  Pauline cooks up the idea of getting her own mother out of the way, and you  can guess where it goes from there (I won't give away any more of the  plot).
The acting in this film is first-rate and marvelous. Kate Winslet,  as always, is elegant and gorgeous. Melanie Lynskey is wonderful as  Pauline; her body language and mannerisms add much to the story. In the  space of only one and a half hours, you feel as if you know Juliet and  Pauline as well as they know each other.
(It should be noted that Juliet  is now an author, working under the name of Anne Perry. Pauline is now  running a children's riding school in England and goes by the name of  Hilary Nathan. There are many informative sites on the internet about both  the film and the real life events.

She can ride as many boats to an icy death as she wants, but in the  end her involvment with this film shall be seen as her wisest move.
This  movie has eveything.  I mean everything; love, death, despair, drama,  humor, tragedy, misunderstandings, young precocious women, and Orson  Welles.  Can anyone say that about a James Cameron film?  Of course not.  King of the world, my eye!",952300800,,532,4.447916666666667

646836,4,6303433766,"Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) and Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynsky) are best of friends, teenagers in 1950's New Zealand. Their friendship quickly becomes intense, obsessive, and as each pushes their own families farther  and farther away, they wander jointly into a world that is more fantasy  than reality.
Peter Jackson's dramatic recount of the true story of  matricide in Christchurch is aggressive as well as imaginative. Jackson's  creative method of storytelling includes a combination of traditional  story, with first person narrative by Pauline, and fantastic lifesize  `claymation' like portrayals of the girls' fantasies. Pauline Parker's own  diaries were contributive in reconstructing many of these events.
As  their parents begin to question the `healthiness' of the relationship, a  decision is made to separate the girls from contact. Jackson implies that a  sexual relation existed between the girls as well, and it's this  implication and the resulting separation that ultimately results in the  girl's joint decision to kill.
When I first saw this film, it was also my  first exposure to Kate Winslet. Her on-screen presence is so commanding,  it's virtually impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she is on  screen.
I understand that, in real life, Juliet made a career as a writer  of mystery stories subsequent to her release, but Pauline is nowhere to be  found.",950313600,,1391,5.336405529953917

It is beautiful - there aren't actually words to describe it. It will always have a very special place in my heart as it has helped me to realise that my relationship with my friend is not of the unheard-of sort, but of a common sort that is so often misjudged and rejected. Please watch this film and judge for yourself. Allow yourself to be absorbed into the love this film holds.

In one truly sadistic  scene the about-to-be-murderesses sweetly urge the about-to-be-victim to  indulge in the last pastry she will ever enjoy on this earth.

I also  have to give props to Melanie Lynsky who protrayed an odd loner.  You guys  have to see this flick.  It makes you reflect on yourself if you ever had a  best friend as a teen.

The realistic portryal of Juliet Hulme  and Pauline Parker is breathtaking. The characters' feelings and worries  come through with undertones of genius and unrealistic views of the world.  All of the supporting actors and actresses are perfect for the parts, and  make you feel as if they are in the 1950's.

Peter Jackson's film of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme is an  exploration of a relationship archetype that has never been so fully  realized on the screen. It is a remarkable achievement, none so the less  for the controversy that has surrounded it since the identities of the two  protagonists has been recently revealed.
There has been much controversy  and argument over how true the film is to what exactly happened.  While all  of this is interesting when discussing the case, I ultimately don't think  it's very important when discussing the film. For I think the film serves  as a much larger canvas: the exploration of the intense emotional  attachment that some girls experience in adolescence.  I don't think it has  ever been done quite the way it has been done in this film. Its marvelous  special effects that take us into the world inhabited by these two Heavenly  Creatures.

Living in a period of time where acceptance is next to godliness you hope that the  generational gap will transcend into the past to help ailing parents cope  with the love affair between their daugthers. Kate Winslet proves to be  astounding in a lead character with her brazen wit and soft underbelly that  repeatedly is given blows by absent parents. Melanie Lynsky also gives a  poweful performance as a hostile withdrawn morbid character finding solace  not in her mother who is a busy housewife but in her best friend  Juliet(Kate Winslet). The two form a friendship that intercepts boundaries  not accepted or understood in the 1950's. Homeosexuality was unspoken and  considered curable as a mental illness. The two girls reveal in their  ""maddness"" to a state of homicidal nature when their parents  attempt to seperate them. As a true story, it is bewildering and saddening  to watch two young girls go through adolenscence with no actual grip on  reality as we know it.

However, they have been going  through the difficult times; it often happens wiht teenagers that they  concentrate only on one person and have an intense friendship.
