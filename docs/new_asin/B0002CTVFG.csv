8026346,3,B0002CTVFG,"Nice DVD, although if I had it to do over, I wouldn't have spent 75 dollars for it.  Love Barbara French's work though.  She is a bat legend and worked / works for BCI the number one bat advocate organization.",1443657600,,209,4.2
8026347,5,B0002CTVFG,"I'm so pleasantly surprised by these intelligent and gentle animals the more I learn about them, and this dvd is a great asset for the insectivore bat enthusiast! It's a budgeted behavioral study created by Barbara French and Amanda Lollar, the two women responsible for the thorough and vital book ""Captive Care and Medical Reference for the Rehabilitation of Insectivorous Bats.""

While this film is very brief, about thirty minutes, it is incredibly thorough. The narration is concise, and details everything that occurs on-screen, so you don't miss a thing. Not only does this slow down and lower the frequencies so you can hear things from a bat's-ear perspective (a factor hard to find in bat specials), but it provides a sound-by-sound analysis of what the calls mean. The footage provided is shown in order with each call and the visual behavior associated with it. This footage is very basic and with night vision so as to not cause the bats to behave other than they normally would in their home. It's for pure analysis and does not clutter the screen with anything fancy. If you're seeking something with pretty colors, varying species, and flight patterns, this is not for you. This is for people who are curious of the surprisingly intricate language of one bat species and a step-by-step look at each call type revealing something about social habits and intelligence of bats in general. For a fascinating look at bats in flight and other such footage, as well as the history of conservation, see ""Merlin Tuttle: Guardian Angel of Bats"".

This brief look into the secret language of bats is an excellent addition to any collection of those with a serious interest in bats, and the proceeds go to the animals. Everyone wins with this purchase, the bats included. And if you're a biology teacher, it doesn't hurt to show this in class for the half hour either!",1265587200,,1872,4.846875
8026348,5,B0002CTVFG,One of a kind!  Step into the little-known world of Mexican Free-Tailed bats and be an intimate part of their secret language.  This never before seen footage and sound documentary will sweep you away!  This DVD is a must for all educators and naturalists.,1090800000,5,256,4.7727272727272725
8026349,5,B0002CTVFG,"Like Noah Webster who began recording the meaning of our words 200 years ago, the creators of this DVD have begun recording the meaning of ""words"" that make up the vocabulary of Mexican free-tailed bats.  I enjoyed this presentation, and anyone using a bat detector at night to listen in on bats will now understand some of the high-pitch calls they hear.

The photography is not meant to compete with Walt Disney studios, but is good, with a raw pioneering quality that reminds me of the early Cape Canaveral and Apollo footage, which is fitting since this DVD explores new territory.  As is the case with similar small ventures that do not wield the marketing muscle of a WalMart, much of the proceeds from these DVDs goes to distribution, leaving a relatively small amount for the care and preservation of wild bats.  Overall, this DVD is educational with funny moments, and the proceeds are for a great cause.",1089849600,7,913,4.7594936708860756
8026350,5,B0002CTVFG,"Incredible!  Although the camera footage is not professionally done, the information gleaned by these two bat care professionals is something that no one else has ever captured on film before.  This look into the behavior, intelligence, and emotional lives of bats is something everyone should witness.  Additionally, the purchase price benefits the rescue of more bats!  Well worth every penny.
I also recommend buying the rehabilitation book, 'Captive Care and Medical Reference for the Rehabilitation of Insectivorous Bats' also by the authors of the DVD.",1089072000,5,558,5.529411764705882
8026351,2,B0002CTVFG,"When compared to some of the videos and DVDs that Bat Conservation International distributes, this DVD is not that impressive.  The camera angles could be better.  It's definitly not worth the money!  You'd be better off buying an educational video from BCI-they are less expensive, better quality, and much more exciting and educational!",1088553600,3,338,5.339622641509434
8026352,5,B0002CTVFG,"This DVD is fascinating!  It provides a rare opportunity to observe the communication, interactions, habits, and lifestyle of the Mexican free-tailed bat.  The information is provided in an interesting and amusing manner, and I discover something new every time I watch it.  BAT TALK offers insights into the behaviors of these incredible little creatures, and is truly a must have for bat specialists, wildlife rehabilitators, naturalists, animal lovers, and nature enthusiasts.",1088121600,5,479,5.71830985915493
8026353,5,B0002CTVFG,Being able to glimpse into the pretty secretive world of the Free-tails is fascinating.  This DVD is remarkable for the way it reveals the language of the Free-tail.  I hope that more information is collected and presented in the future.  Wow!,1088035200,3,243,4.878048780487805
8026354,5,B0002CTVFG,"Being able to eavesdrop on vocalizations while watching movements and postures is valuable as well as entertaining for all chiroptophiles.
Many bat species are long-lived and colonial, which means they have long term relationships with roost mates.  It's important for researchers and rehabbers alike to understand relationship dynamics if they are to come to a greater understanding of the needs of these fragile and environmentally vital creatures.",1088035200,3,450,5.7164179104477615
