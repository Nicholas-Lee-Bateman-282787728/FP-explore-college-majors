3841516,3,B0021UDX8I,"This DVD - ""Alien Origins"" is a video of a Lecture held in 2005
and ties in nicely with Lloyd Pye's
""Everything you know is Wrong - Book One: Human Origins"".
If you have read the book, it is great to hear some of his and Zecharia Sitchin's theories,
of ""who"" were Earth's first inhabitants, why they were here and how we, the Human race, came into being.

The ""sound"" echoes a bit...it was not recorded in a studio.
The subject: You may ""get the hint"" that Lloyd believes what was written in the Holy Bible's - Old Testament (especially Genesis) has a real basis in history, but that we have been only given the Cliff-Notes. That some of the ""real stories"" were first written down by Sumerians Scribes from the Aliens and that even the Babylonian texts were ""copied"" from earlier texts. Many of these texts were thought to be ""fables"", by mainstream Science, and therefore, ignored by most, as they would be too ""unsettling"" to their paradigms.

Lloyd projects that, just maybe, these tales were not revealed to us, until now, because we were not ready, as a species, to hear them and accept the the implications of knowing these truths.  Formalized religion threw other writings ""out"" (before Canonizing the Holy Bible). Done to protect us from confusion with multiple Alien 'demi-gods'(?)...they mashed ""entity"" and ""story"" together, into one ""composite God"", and something more ""palatable"", for us to focus and place our adoration and worship on. What would religion have done with these ancient texts? One of these gods - Enlil shouted ""Creation belongs to the Father of All Beginning"" when talking about upgrading the ""Primitives"" found on Earth to ""Intelligent Workers"". That even these Alien ""demi-gods"", passing themselves off as ""god(s) to these ""Earthlings"", show their homage to the ""Real Creator"", in their ""private discussions"" as left in the words on the Sumerian Tablets.  This Video ""Alien Origins"" and Lloyd's First Book ""Everything you Know..."" has me on a quest to read all of Z. Sitchin! Lloyd Pye's DVD leaves you with wanting to know more...Get Started!

3841517,5,B0021UDX8I,"Sound quality was good, content superb, Lloyd Pye is awesome anyway, but this was really enjoyable.  I'd recommend to any looking for information in this field.",1298937600,,160,5.153846153846154
3841518,1,B0021UDX8I,"This is dumb. Don't bother watching it. As soon as I read the ""Don't you ever wonder why we use 10% of our massively supercharged brains?"" line in the trailer, I knew it was going to be bad and not very credible. WE USE 100% OF OUR BRAINS. Well, I did before I watched this documentary; now I'm doomed to use only 10% of what I have left.",1291766400,3,338,3.985294117647059
3841519,1,B0021UDX8I,"I've learned the hard way (by purchasing two of their films) at once that ""Reality Films"" is not really a film company. As with this  production  you are treated to garish music, cheesy special effects and what is basically a slide show done to music and voice-over. Anyone with a laptop can make what they call movies. Pass this by.",1278633600,4,333,4.533333333333333
3841520,3,B0021UDX8I,"Okay, forget everything you know, or think you know, about evolution and human origins--we are, instead, alien visitors from outer space.  At some point in Earth's history, humans arrived--they weren't formed over millions of years from an ape-like ancestor.  The actual science for this is explained in this DVD, and unless you're a forensics expert, a bit mind-numbing.  Since there's a whole branch of science to understand evolution, it's not surprising there's a lot to say about an opposing theory.  At over two hours of lecture, there's much to think about here, but unfortunately, even though expert Lloyd Pye is actually holding a microphone, the camera mic is apparently (you guessed it) on the camera, which makes it hard to hear.",1276214400,,741,5.099173553719008
3841521,3,B0021UDX8I,"This is basically a Power Point lecture, which will be more palatable to some than others, but it's interesting stuff about scientific theory around the human brain and aliens, including the opening question, Have you ever wondered why we only use 10% of our massively super-charged brain? Lloyd Pye is the author of Everything You Know Is Wrong.",1252368000,6,346,4.982758620689655
3841522,4,B0021UDX8I,"Lloyd Pye attempts to sway us to his way of thinking in this slightly overlong double feature movie.  The science was a tad over my head in places but I am not a science minded person.  These two minor issues aside, I found his arguments interesting and challenging.  The DNA idea was intriguing and even seemed possible while the alien skull was a little tougher to swallow.  All entertaining and thought provoking.  A must see if you have any alien interest.",1250121600,6,460,4.62962962962963

8349503,3,B0021UDX8I,A poor quality production and left me disappointed. Better to watch it on YouTube for free.,1425600000,,91,4.75
8349504,1,B0021UDX8I,"Sorry to say that while seller was good with on time delivery, it's not the seller's fault the video and sound quality of this particular lecture with Lloyd Pye was worse than amateur quality. I couldn't even get through it. Save your money and just watch or copy directly from youtube and you'll be better off.",1398211200,2,311,4.571428571428571
8349505,4,B0021UDX8I,This is a lecture. Obviously a good lecture is not for everybody--some people need something more stimulating. But for those who find learning some very interesting things about a mind blowing subject...like perhaps we are of alien origin...this is incredible. He does a wonderful job clearly outlining his key points and presents his research very convincingly.,1374883200,3,362,5.482142857142857
8349506,5,B0021UDX8I,Lloyd Pie obviously has a wealth of knowledge on aliens. I heard him on Art Bell's show years ago and was fascinated. This dvd really hits the mark and covers new ground which is essential for me because I have watched so many ufo presentations.,1374883200,4,245,4.466666666666667
8349507,4,B0021UDX8I,The majority of the DVD deals with the author's presentation on the appearance of homo sapiens at an evolutionary time that doesn't make sense. He is great at the use of science and logic to show in plain terms how the only explanation must be intervention. The remaining part of the DVD deals with what seems to be the real deal... an alien skull! Will seriously cause you to think. Buy it!,1371686400,2,391,4.444444444444445
8349508,4,B0021UDX8I,"The ideas presented in this video are quite compelling. While I've heard some of the theories presented here previously, I've never heard such an in depth discussion.",1360022400,,166,5.185185185185185
8349509,2,B0021UDX8I,"I was hoping this would be more of a movie with narration, but in actuality it was a super long mundane college like lecture. I guess he had some interesting points, but he talked about subjects irrelevant to his point most of the time.  Overall, I did not like this movie and could not even get more than halfway through it",1357430400,,324,4.311475409836065
8349510,3,B0021UDX8I,"This is basically a no-frills lecture introducing some very radical ideas...namely that our own DNA is not entirely of earthly origin.  The bare-bones approach was something I liked, because I like a good lecture, but not everyone is so lecture-oriented and they may appreciate a more flashy DVD.  The information contained here was entirely interesting and worth the sacrifice of Hollywood glamour.",1356912000,,399,5.419354838709677
