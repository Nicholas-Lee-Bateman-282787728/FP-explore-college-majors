8192888,5,B000PMFRZG,so excited to have found this DVD! It is so hard to find many of the movies from the 1980's  early 1990's say 1994.. which are the epitome of my youth! I'm 39 maybe going to hit that midlife crisis don't know but just having a lot of need to relive the good ol days with the good movies they don't make them like that anymore even if some of them are corny same thing with the music,1421366400,,382,3.8974358974358974

8192892,4,B000PMFRZG,I am a 'child of the 80's' so these two movies really take me back. These are nowhere near acadamy award winning movies but they are guilty pleasures. Uma Thurman makes her acting debut in Johnny Be Good. She has come a long way since then! Youngblood was the movie Patrick Swayze was in 1 year before his big breakout in Dirty Dancing.,1350950400,,336,4.349206349206349
