5085537,5,B007GMKXAC,"This man is as raw as they come. If you have a weak heart or you're easily offended (women), stay far away!",1407542400,,107,3.909090909090909
5085538,2,B007GMKXAC,not as funny as usual.,1407024000,,22,3.6
5085539,4,B007GMKXAC,"Okay...

Mr. Holcomb is not your average comedian.  For men, he can be very funny...in a realistic, sarcastic kind of way; for women, he could be the total opposite.  Dont be surprised if you and your lady are watching this DVD, and you're dying because of his jokes and your lady doesnt talk to you for a while because you were laughing at those jokes.

One thing that I can recommend before you buy this DVD (if you're unfamiliar with his brand of comedy) is to go on Google or YouTube and do your research.  From his jokes about side chicks, the way large women look in dresses, and his views on women in general, this dude is raw from beginning to end - and hes not apologetic, either.  To him, it is what it is.  Sometimes hell say yall should see how these women in the audience are looking at me right now.

Truth  if you don't know a comedian, don't go to his or her show just to end up giving them the evil eye because their views on life doesnt match with yours.  Same goes with this DVD: you cant get mad because some of the jokes he tells may push a button  thats life, people.  Its not going to be a Disney fairy tale all of the time.

I know if it was me, Id be mostly mad with myself for buying a DVD before doing the research on this comedian (if I didn't know who Corey Holcomb is to begin with).  Truth be told, my wife sorta likes him; sure, she thinks hes a blank blank, but she can appreciate some of his style of comedy  SOME, not all of it.

To summarize: stay open-minded while looking at this.  For those of you who are fans of Mr. Holcombs work, yall will know what to expect from this dude.  In my opinion, I hope he continues to keep pushing to become a better and more successful comedian than he is right now.",1405728000,7,1739,4.109792284866469

5085607,1,B007GMKXAC,"This DVD was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! And I used to be a fan. Corey's brand of humor has always been outlandish at best, but for this he stooped to a new low. He made horrible remarks about abortions, pregnant woman,  mothers, the list goes on. This man is damaged, extremely. And that was just half of the DVD, that's all I could tolerate so I stopped it and threw it out. He mentioned being fired from one of his shows because of his comments, he didn't get the hint.
