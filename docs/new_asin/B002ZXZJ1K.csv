As a 24 year old this anime was extremely for me to relate with. One of my all time favorites Highly recommended!",1488672000,,292,4.425925925925926

8385424,5,B002ZXZJ1K,Should I buy this box set 3 or not? And does it have to do with the original series? Plates help?,1398729600,,97,3.6666666666666665
8385425,5,B002ZXZJ1K,"It is a zany escape that reminds me loads of some of the dramas we had back in university.  It is like that book ""everything i need to know i learned in kindergarten"" but at a college level.  It is fun with some interesting story lines.  OF COURSE THERE IS TONES OF UNREQUITED LOVE STORY LINES but I guess that is what kept the series going for 3 box sets.  I like that it wasn't all happy endings but more realistic ones with some heartaches.  LOADS TO LAUGH AT in this one.  The price was right the condition great and the seller sent it in a timely fashion.  If you like the Anime Clannad you may like this one.",1395792000,,614,4.109243697478991
8385426,5,B002ZXZJ1K,"I enjoyed the 1st season over the 2nd season, but the 3rd season clearly won me over. I got so involved in the characters' lives that I wished for different endings for each of them. Well written, funny and full of love.",1391472000,,220,4.261904761904762
8385427,5,B002ZXZJ1K,"I have watched the whole story  - box set 1, box set 2, and box set 3 many times when television was boring. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1369612800,,133,3.925925925925926
8385428,4,B002ZXZJ1K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this entire series.  This last season was a bit disjointed, but considering all of the stories it was covering it was still very well done.  The characters matured well, and while I was ready to choke a couple of them for not letting go, their situations were very realistic and touching.  I think the series ended very well and on positive notes for all concerned.  If you like anime that doesn't involve giant robots, large weapons, or super/psychic powers, give this one a chance.  It's a look at life through the eyes of a group of art school kids and their teachers/mentors that just leaves you with a satisfied smile.  But start back with Season 1 to get the whole story.  You won't be sorry you did.",1357171200,,727,4.546153846153846
8385429,5,B002ZXZJ1K,"Honey and Clover is fantastic. One of the best anime I've ever seen. The characters are loveable, to the point that I wanted to jump into the TV and stomp the guys that tried to move in on Ayumi and Hagu. The drama is amazing and moving. The art is one of a kind. I've never seen an anime with art like this one. It's too good to pass up. This is a priority one for any anime fan.",1348876800,,380,3.8227848101265822
8385430,5,B002ZXZJ1K,"I hold to this simple maxim when it comes to anime: Art school anime is often worth it. Many anime that features art students are raucous comedies (Hidamari Sketch comes to mind), and ""HachiKuro"" is no slouch in the comedy department, but this drama is told with unparalleled beauty and warmth, largely because of the original artist, Chica Umino. The sketch-and-watercolor visual style is innovative in a time when practically every animation studio reached for bright colors, CG, and 3D modeling; the characters are unique and expressive, and the soundtrack does what every great soundtrack does-- highlight the great moments, and stay in the background otherwise.

It's exciting to see Noitamina shows being released in this region (perhaps because of the ADV licensing brouhaha, HachiKuro was not released here for YEARS), because it means other great shows will soon be released (I'm looking at you, Bunny Drops and AnoHana!).

If you enjoyed this series, check out other works where Umino-sensei is the character designer, or the artist. March Comes In Like a Lion is her current series, and hopefully it too will get the anime treatment.",1316217600,,1144,5.145161290322581
8385431,5,B002ZXZJ1K,"First, some clarification.  Considering the episode count of the two previous sets and some other details, this final set of Honey and Clover - being marketed in Region 1 as Honey and Clover 3 - is apparently the limited series Honey and Clover 2 which followed the original series.  It follows Yuta and Hagu's final year as undergraduates as they prepare to follow their three friends into the workforce.  The initial recap episode is probably not necessary for those who have been following the series on DVD.

As Yuta decides what kind of architectural work he wants to do and Ayumi grieves as the last nail is put in the coffin of her hopes of a romantic relationship with Takumi with Rika finally deciding to let herself love again, we finally find out why Shinobu needs so much money as Nomiya stands prepared to catch Ayumi when she falls if only she'll let him.  But a terrible accident leaves everyone dropping everything and running to a friend in need as one of the gang suffers injuries that would be rough for anyone but potentially devestating and career ending for someone who works with their hands.

Shinobu's relationship with his brother Kaoru is one of the sets' highlights, as is Hagu's transformation in this volume from a girl-child into a young woman with grace, maturity and a deep understanding of and love for the people in her life.  The final scene, and our final view of Yuta as the series ends, will stay in the memory of viewers long after it is over.

The end of Honey and Clover solidifies the series as a must-buy for anime viewers who have gone through the college journey, even if that journey has not involved the visual arts which are it's characters' passion.",1269129600,15,1699,4.65886287625418
