Poor Dean Cain--how did he get involved with this mess of a movie.",1348617600,,233,4.2727272727272725
4493856,1,B004XC5LXM,"I gotta say I'm not a big fan of Dean Cain, I don't know why, I've just always thought he was mediocre at best. But he isn't the reason I don't care for this movie, I mean don't get me wrong I've seen worse, but this movie definitely needed some work. I'm lucky I actually saw it on a movie channel and didn't waste money on buying it.  I mean yeah there were some gruesome scenes, but over all that was not going to save this movie.",1314576000,,433,3.9770114942528734
4493857,4,B004XC5LXM,"I mostly like Maneater because the actual killings are *exceptionally* violent.  Of course, there's a fair share of pointless drama involving the father and daughter pertaining to boyfriends, sex and their dead wife/mother (and how the father is seeing illusions that she's still really alive and well when she's actually anything but) but I was able to overlook these portions of the movie and focus on the horror aspect.

Be warned though- there's a lot of nudity and the sexual scenes are more revealing than in other films of the same genre.  You will see sexual positions that are more realistic and, in my opinion at least, more unacceptable than in other horror movies.

The actual monster doing the killings is... well, exactly *who* is turning into a monster, roaming the woods late at night and eating fresh flesh is a mystery that I won't reveal.  It's one of the characters though, but I'm not saying which one.  The way the monster murders his victims is more violent than in several other horror films I could name- in some instance he graphically rips at a womans body and tears her beautiful flesh completely off, showing blood dripping down her face as she screams and struggles to survive.  The film makers did a wonderful job in the graphics department.

I admit the storyline is pretty mediocre.  There's just way too much pointlessness involving the father, his daughter, the teenagers having constant conversations involving typical stuff pertaining to their age group, and even the cops rattle their jaws one too many times.  However, because of the fair amount of suspense and of course the presence of the monsters themselves, I will rate Maneater fairly high.

Just be warned- there's a LOT of movies with the same exact title that are *nothing* like this.  Don't accidentally pick up a romantic comedy now, you hear!",1313452800,,1843,4.890675241157556
4493858,1,B004XC5LXM,"Why do distributors constantly get the aspect ratio wrong when they release DVDs? I recorded this movie off cable TV, where it was broadcast in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1. I decided to purchase the DVD (okay, don't ask me why) but, on this DVD, the movie is presented in an aspect ratio closer to 1.78:1 or 1.85:1.

You would think that, in the current day and age, somebody would get this right by now.

UPDATED 10/5/11: This same movie is now available IN ITS ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO from Scanbox Entertainment on Amazon.co.uk.",1313366400,,536,4.691489361702128
4493859,3,B004XC5LXM,"MANEATER is a movie that could've been better---but it's basically just another low budget horror flick.  Employing Indian folklore as its basis, the movie explores the legendary Wendigo, a shapeshifting cannibal terrorizing a small town.
Dean Cain plays the sheriff, a former criminal profiler, carrying the burden of a disappeared wife and a sexually awakening 17 year old daughter...and he's having violent dreams involving an apparent serial killer.
The script tries to make Cain a potential suspect as well as an overly protective father.
The creature effects are pretty cheesy as evidenced in the chaotic jerky camerawork which doesn't give us a clear image of the monster, just his glowing eyes.  The Wendigo's identity is somewhat a surprise.  There's plenty of boob shots and poorly filmed gore.  Cain's performance doesn't help---he's in some kind of stuporous vacuum during the movie, appearing to be earning his salary, but nothing more.  The rest of the lesser-known cast is merely adequate.
MANEATER was filmed in 2008 and sat on the shelf until this DVD release.  It's moderately entertaining for real horror maniacs but not a highly recommended entry.",1312588800,,1167,5.281081081081081
4493860,3,B004XC5LXM,"Well, the jacket cover on the DVD was exciting.  As for the movie itself....routine.
Dean Cain plays a former FBI profiler with issues: he has a missing wife.  He's now a sheriff in a backwoods town where people suddenly go missing.  In a town that small, you'd think they'd notice when anyone goes missing but several slip their notice anyway.  The main suspect is a monster with suspicious DNA.  Late in the game, the sheriff worries that he might be the monster on the loose....or just a guy with a really bad temper?
The so-called monster isn't filmed to great effect.  They poorly utilize some camera gimmicks to cover the design of the monster.  Yes, there's nudity and several instances of interrupted sex.  There's a kid posse at one point, out to bag the monster (they get a grizzly instead).  The editing was sloppy, giving this movie an amateur feel.  It was filmed in 2008 but they just now got around to releasing it on DVD (I don't believe there was a theatrical release).  It's not terrible but it's not all that good either.  It's okay to watch once.  I'm definitely not keeping it to watch again.",1311379200,3,1113,4.588832487309645
4493861,4,B004XC5LXM,"Great to watch with some nice surprises. Makes you wonder why Dean Cain hasn't done more as he's very capable of carrying a film as a leading man. I'm picky about my horror, whether low or big budget...this one has some originality, which is so rare in film these days.",1310947200,,269,4.4
4493862,5,B004XC5LXM,"OK...So this is a low budget film that looks to be shot anamorphic! If you enjoy low budget horror films and like great horror photography this is one you need to watch!
Story is not bad, acting isn't awful...Monster could be better, All in all I really enjoyed this film and the production value and cinematography are a thumbs up! Great nudity always helps too!",1310860800,2,363,4.6
4493863,2,B004XC5LXM,"""We got a thing, a people may be dead thing.""  After a brutal murder takes place Sheriff Bailey (Cain) is called to investigate.  After his dreams become more and more real he wonders if they hold the key to solving the crime.  This movie has a combination of many ideas from other movies, and when put together in this movie...none of them really work.  This is pretty much a movie that has talking in between the sex, nudity and gore.  The acting is not that impressive, and the effects are pretty low budget.  The overall idea is that there is a serial killer on the loose and going after people while they are having sex, because when the killer watches, only then can it turn into the killing form.  I'm not kidding.  Overall, not a very good movie, but when Dean Cain is the biggest name they can get the expectations are a little lower.  Overall, there have been worse horror movies that have come out, but not many.  I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - Nope.

8446662,5,B004XC5LXM,"This is a gem of a horror movie in which a rural sheriff and his deputies come to grips with a
legendary Native American man-eating creature who has come to life. It's scary, sexy, well-paced and fun to watch, with
a bit of a surprise ending.",1509062400,,242,4.282608695652174
8446663,2,B004XC5LXM,"The film suffers from a variety of issues brought up by other reviewers, namely too much time spent on the daughter and her relationships drags the movie down at  every turn. Not much horror action, limited to some short scenes. The ""bear"" is, well, not on screen long enough or developed enough to be very interesting aside from a random bad guy. Most irritating to me were the scenes shot in the family home - was there a fire? Why is smoke or fog in the house? To highlight beams of sunlight? Very odd. I kept thinking the fireplace flue was blocked or something.",1503360000,,566,4.4423076923076925
8446664,2,B004XC5LXM,"After Lois & Clark, Dean Cain really fell off my radar. I haven't seen him in much of anything (aside from hosting Ripley's Believe it or Not). He must've been desperate for cash when he signed on to star in Maneater. This is one rotten, easily forgettable horror flick... the kind you often see airing on the SyFy Channel. Cain plays a highly unlikable sheriff. His small town is plagued with a rogue wendigo. Most people attribute the wendigo's murder spree to a wild cougar or grizzly bear. Cain is tasked with discovering the true source of chaos and eliminating it. Only Cain (and the screenwriters) are more concerned with the sex life of Cain's teenage daughter... so foolish family drama overshadows the wendigo story at every turn. When the wendigo does BRIEFLY appear, there's barely any payoff. The lighting is too dark, the camera is too shaky, and the gore effects are subpar. The wendigo costume itself looks like a cross between Pumpkinhead and HBO's Crypt Keeper... crafted on a shoestring budget. I'd recommend skipping this movie.",1502409600,,1048,4.893258426966292
8446665,4,B004XC5LXM,"Harry Baily (Dean Cain) is a profiler who is almost like a psychic detective. He lives in the small California town of Blackwood with his daughter Pearl (Lacy Phillips) and his wife (Shea Curry) who he is still waiting for her to come back from the store. A series of killings in town causes one to believe a Wendingo shapeshifter (looks like a Morlock) in on the loose.

This is a basic 80's style horror film, a little humor, a little teen sex, a bad looking monster, and three minimum nude scenes. 3 1/2 stars

8446668,3,B004XC5LXM,"If it had not been for the irritating behavior of Dean Cain's sheriff in regards to his daughter I might have given this an additional star, but I
felt that it was over done and distracted from the story.  A Wendigo story with several people being mysteriously killed by the shape shifter until it is eventually killed.  Standard fare, but it would have been better without the overkill behavior they had Dean Cain exhibiting about his daughter.  It felt more like sexual obsession than a father worrying about his daughter.",1406764800,,524,4.8
