6120915,4,B00GWUU6MO,"""Deadly Presence proves to be the little film that can, a ghost story with atmospheric film making"" Was from a review I noticed online. I decided to check this film out since I like indie films of this genre.
3 girls stay at a 'haunted house' and months later, one of them hasn't felt right since that night, and calls on her friend to help -  the bulk of the story starts here.
This film was super indie. Felt like it was shot on an digital camcorder, but yet, it didn't bother me. Acting was good, and seemed real. There were a few good creepy scares. The story line was simple, yet kept me entertained. The film had a slow pace, it could have been a bit faster with a few changes here and there.  Sometimes you watch films like this and the audio is a mess, either it's too low or just awful in general, but the audio in this was pretty good. Film score was creepy and worked. I was actually surprised thinking this might be a handheld 'found footage' type movie, but after the first few minutes I realized they shot this like a traditional movie. Not too bad of a film over all considering it's budget restraints.",1392681600,4,1117,4.289099526066351

8628039,4,B00GWUU6MO,Wow I liked this! Creepy! Yeah was boring in some scenes but was better than some of the other movies I've seen lately!,1521590400,,119,4.217391304347826
8628040,1,B00GWUU6MO,"This could have been a good movie but it became boring beyond belief.  Much too slow moving, way too much of nothing happening for long periods of time.",1510185600,,152,4.428571428571429
8628041,3,B00GWUU6MO,"It's not all that bad, but it's just not very good, either.  For a horror movie, it's really slow and boring.  In the beginning we have the 3 girls at a seance in a haunted house that's not really scary.  One of the girls, Candice, has some sort of experience that months later has affected her so much that she commits suicide, and then wants another of her friends to do certain weird but ""helpful"" things after her death.  This means she slowly reads some scribbles in a notebook, watches a DVD Candice made, goes to a park to see if the body of Danny, Candice's boyfriend is actually buried there, then she must somehow get Candice's body back to the haunted house.  The body has to be burned there.  This is to destroy the spirit of one of the former occupants that has invaded Candice's body.  Now is the only truly scary part, but it mostly takes place behind a closed door, so we really have no idea what's up!  We hear thumping, a lot of ""oh no's"", and then some footsteps, but whose?  No easy wrap up.  A disappointing end to an altogether disappointing movie.",1501372800,,1070,4.385786802030457
8628042,1,B00GWUU6MO,Absolutely terrible in every way.,1499040000,,33,5.8
8628043,3,B00GWUU6MO,"Deadly Presence might have horrible acting, but to be honest the movie relies on atmosphere so heavily that the poor acting doesn't even matter.  There's way more silence than spoken dialogue overall.  So while unintentional, it's one big reason I'm able to overlook the weak acting and enjoy the movie.  Warning- I waited until two days after watching the movie to review it.  D'oh!  This means I forget certain parts and won't be able to explain them in detail.  Ooooh well!  Hey I've been extremely tired as of late.

It's about three women who try to communicate with the dead in a haunted house.  A couple months later the one girl (Elissa Dowling's character) calls her one friend who was with her during the seance (played by Kathy Sue Holtorf).  Elissa is having mental issues.  She's feeling distraught and is clearly being tormented by something given her jittery nervous ways.  Kathy hurries over, and when she gets there everything's fine for a while, though it's obvious something isn't right with Elissa's character.  Elissa wants Kathy to spend the night, and she does... but the next day... that's when things get really creepy!

If I recall, Kathy wakes up to find a video Elissa left for her.  After Kathy watches the video she walks into the bathroom and sees Elissa... dead in the bathtub.  Ew, what happened!  I knew she was a little depressed but come on, suicide is a bit much!  From here, Kathy quietly walks around Elissa's apartment room, and I mean *quietly* for a huge chunk of the first half.  She doesn't do much of anything.  There is a creepy atmosphere though which is nice.  We get the feeling something scary is about to surprise us- it's only a matter of time.  Unfortunately it doesn't happen much.

Kathy tries to ask Sabrina (the other girl who participated in the seance that night) to come over.  She says rather desperately that it's an urgent matter since something is clearly wrong with the apartment room (and of course the fact Elissa's character is dead and in the bathtub) but she doesn't buy into anything Kathy's saying and hangs up.  Kathy contacts Sabrina's character again later on but still, Sabrina thinks Kathy's character is just crazy.  What a rude non-believer, and a rude friend not to take the request of an urgent phone call!  Maybe they weren't actually friends, but if that's the case, why would three girls just gather for a seance that night?

While not much happens for the longest time, it's okay.  You know why?  Because the atmosphere, as I say above, is pretty good.  Sure, we get the typical scares such as cabinet doors slowly opening and other scares around the apartment room, but it's not much.  Anyway eventually Kathy finds another video of Elissa where she claims she killed her boyfriend and even gave clues where she buried the body.  Where do these clues lead?  To the forest where Kathy searches hard and heavy.  She eventually finds the body, but not before an older lady walking her dog *almost* sees Kathy.  Luckily Kathy's able to hide behind a tree.  If the lady had seen her, or if he dog had sniffed out the buried body, Kathy would be spotted and look incredibly guilty!

Kathy returns to Elissa's home and finds a really prissy and annoying blonde haired woman standing in the kitchen.  Since Elissa's still in the bathtub and in fact she remained there until the end, Kathy wants to make sure this blonde haired woman doesn't see the body.  This leads to a couple intense moments, such as when the woman wants to use the bathroom but Kathy blocks the door.  The ending is interesting.  SPOILERS!  Kathy takes Elissa's body and drags it outside.  I won't spoil what happens at the very end.

The atmosphere is pretty solid but that's all the movie has going for it since otherwise it's weak all around.  Deadly Presence is probably more like 3.5 stars out of 5 and I recommend it.",1498262400,,3872,4.686478454680535
8628044,2,B00GWUU6MO,This is a G movie. Not very good looking at,1476921600,,43,3.4
8628045,1,B00GWUU6MO,"Very slow moving and very boring.  They never really tell the audience what this evil thing is.  It is mostly about a girl pacing in her friends apartment, reading a journal and watching a DVD made for her.  Nothing really happens until the end of the movie and even that is nothing since the ""something happening"" is behind a closed door, than movie over, boring boring boring.",1464912000,,378,4.611940298507463
8628046,3,B00GWUU6MO,"With good directing this could have been a decent film. As it is the story line is not clear as to what you're supposed to be thinking of each of the characters and it seems to jump around. The old guy that is supposed to set the fear component way up high should have been scarier and familiar with the evil in that house reminded me of Burl Ives, a kindly old Grampa. Not that bad",1464566400,,382,4.0394736842105265
8628047,1,B00GWUU6MO,not a good movie,1407024000,,16,3.25
8628048,4,B00GWUU6MO,"This movie is a throw back to when there were few special effects and the movie relied on creepy music, noises or things that go bump in the night and just plain old edge of the seat suspense.  It has a good mix of scary scenes, but nothing you would lose sleep over and the filming is by far not the greatest, the acting are less than spectacular, but do carry their parts very well and do pull off good chemistry in the movie.  A good point for parents who allow their children to watch horror films, it does not contain any nudity and not too much gore.  All around a good movie for the price",1399507200,3,595,4.112068965517241
