8233752,5,B000YQ3UK2,"Having just worked with Jim on his upcoming ""The Limits of Control"", I have witnessed first hand the extent of his genius. Jim is a passionate and intuitive storyteller who takes untraditional routes to explore his characters. Jim's early films are his best. The performances he coaxes from his cast are unparalleled. These are my favorite films. The Criterion editions are worth every penny, with their pristine transfers and special features.",1222300800,,444,5.267605633802817
