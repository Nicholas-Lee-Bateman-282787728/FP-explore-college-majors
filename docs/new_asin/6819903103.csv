 Bo-Gum Park and Yoo-Jeong Kim received an award for there great acting and they deserved it. My family enjoyed it a lot and I would recommend it to people who like Korean drama from this time period.",1487980800,,312,4.777777777777778
1110127,5,6819903103,"It is a nice K drama. I watches it on Hulu because the DVD I bought through your company was poorly taped.

It is a good entertainment for all ages, the development of the plot is nicely done, the casts specially the main characters did very well doing their role. There were some flaws but overall it is awesome. I enjoyed watching it.",1487721600,2,336,4.333333333333333

1110261,5,6819903103,"First of all, this 3 DVD version may not be compressed at all. It is rendered in DVD9 format (DVD5 is the regular DVD) which is very common in Asia, but not so in North America. Also a word of warning: not all DVD player will play well a DVD9 - my Samsung BD player only plays 4 of the 6 episodes in this edition, but my Sony BD player did play it with no issues.

Now for this series: It is really a wonderful K-Drama, well paced and with a beautiful love story. Watched this series five times already and it was worth all the time. No wonder it stole absolutely the audience from the other great K-Drama ""Moon Lovers Scarlet Heart"" that aired at the same time.

Now, will try to give some details on this series without spoilers. My favorite episodes are 4, 7 and 9, but all other episodes are really good and the actors and actresses are superb and they did a magnificent work worth of being called artists indeed. The acting is so powerful that you almost don't need the subtitles (well, I don't know Korean) to catch the emotions conveyed and they bring you into tears at times, not particularly because it is sad but because it is so beautifully presented to you. The performance of the cast was exceptional.

Episode 4 is called ""After the play ends"" but could be called ""Everything for a friend, plus love"" - it is where the main female character risks everything for what she thinks is friendship when, in fact she just ended expressing her love to her dear friend and he fell for her. At this point, don't think that she even knew it was already love. This is also the episode where the wonderful humming version of ""Because I Miss You"" song is introduced. A real piece of art.

Episode 7 is called ""Confession"" and the highlight is given not by the main characters, but by another supporting character that is also very emotional and may bring you into tears: ""A proper farewell is as sincere as love""...

Episode 9 is called ""The moment the door of my heart opened"" and it is a poignant episode where the main male character silently conveys his love to the maiden he loves and begs her to stay with him... Wonderful scene indeed.

Episode 11 is when the Ra On Version of ""Because I Miss You"" - sung by Beige - is introduced fully and it goes through most of the highly emotional scenes throughout episode 14, when the Yeong Version of the same song is introduced.

Now, a comment on ""Because I Miss You"" song: All three versions are included in the official soundtrack and it is worth having. I particularly love the humming version and the Ra On version, both by Beige. The Yeong version seems a lot more refined and is sung by a male singer, but does not have the emotional strength Beige puts in the first two versions. She single-handedly smashes your heart (search on YouTube for her live performance in a radio talk show and you may get tears in your eyes so powerfully charged is her singing of this song! So much so that the radio show anchor became speechless after she was done singing)

Highly recommend this for everyone who wants to see a very beautiful love story, great superb performances of all the cast and a smashing song.",1492128000,,3154,4.425862068965517

1110265,5,6819903103,"OK, starting off, this was a funny, smart, happy, sad, interesting miniseries.  I originally saw this on the local television station (LA18) and my entire family enjoyed it (recommended for teenagers on up).  I wish more programs like this were made.

The production values are high, the story great and the actors/actresses made it worth watching.  This series is one of the most popular in Asia, and its easy to see why.

On a technical note: if you wish to see it, buy this version.  Yes, it is more expensive, but the video and audio quality are the best.  The series is over 12 episodes and is spread out over 5 discs.  Which means there is no visual or audio compression.",1490832000,4,677,4.537190082644628
