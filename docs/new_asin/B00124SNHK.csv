8243845,5,B00124SNHK,"Best artistic film i have seen in years. Incredibly connected to Buuel/Dali's ""An Andalusian Dog"" (quoted few other Buuel's films as well) brings completely fresh vision of surrealism. I saw this film together with a Hollywood actors agent who was completely shocked by the film considering it the act of crime. I had to be easy with comments cause it would make me a criminal as well. There is hilarious scene with Chabrol in the ZOO which rediscovers his tremendous, almost forgotten, acting talent. One of the highlights of the film is wonderful Velvet who makes mythical anti-Venus character so pure and powerful. So, ""Avida"" is such brilliantly made film, on best tracks of European film-making, which goes straight to film art history with no doubt. I consider Gustave De Kervern and Benot Delpine saviors of European film art.",1524355200,,833,5.0

Eighty-five years passed the height of surrealism, so Avida is also not for surrealism movie house aficionados, yet the movie displays Dali surrealism art form. So maybe it is for surrealistic pillow dreamers. Then again maybe not.

To say the least, this movie by directors Benoit Delephine and Gustave Kervern breaks the mode of traditional linear movie of beginning, middle, and ending. Yet it's inspired, influenced, spurred on by a subconscious driven force, namely, non-sense. In other words: automatism. Avida is a whimsical, surf ride on the wave crest of subconscious thoughts and behavior, very much like tossing a million-piece puzzle in the air and say that's it, I'm finished.

Art and art house are written all over this film: it takes the French new wave cinema craze in the early 1960s, late 1950s, and tosses it upside down, side ways, and every other direction of what is thoughts. Nonetheless, if one realizes this is an art movie, Avida is quite interesting. Visually it's pleasing, and as far as dialogue, there's very little, mostly in French, yet it's a film about images without a solid story line.

Yes, this movie is in part surrealistic, the battle against conscious, logical phony thoughts, in other words: non-sense. Yet it's not surrealistic for the simple reason, surrealism heyday was during the 1920s with Andre Breton advocating rebellion against manipulated, contrived, conscious, misleading false thoughts. To say the least, Avida is abstract. Very much like the abstract expressionist such as Jackson Pollack. The art only makes sense to the viewer, if it reaches that level. It makes sense through subjective interpretation. Very much like a nut case, telling his or her woes to a psychiatrist. No one is really going to understand except for the one telling the woe. It's very subjective.

Nonetheless, I like art movies. It rocks my boat. For me, abstract art is food for thoughts. Nonetheless, Avida is not for everyone. Especially those seeking a story from Point A to Point B. This film is Point A to Point Z mixed together in a bag, which is known as the Alpha to Omega bag of bundle.",1448755200,2,2164,4.934065934065934
8243848,1,B00124SNHK,"Very strange film by Chabrol. I still don't know what it is all about. Immage gallery or what? Let me go to Imdb, maybe they will tell me if the film makes any sense.",1417996800,,166,3.911764705882353
8243849,1,B00124SNHK,"I wholeheartedly salute you ""erisgeenhoop"" (reviewer above me)! You bravely voice the true feelings of today's silent majority who dare not speak out on such matters. But you good sir, have inspired me to step forth from the gloom! I join you in brotherhood! Who needs pinheads like Bunuel, Cocteau, Godard, Resnais, Chabrol and Truffaut! And don't forget the detestable Fellini, and ultra-detestable Bergman and his ultra-ultra detestable American counterpart, Cassavetes! Thank goodness these days we have REAL directors like Cameron, Gibson (and the 'People's Director,' M. Night Shyamalan) to show everyone the true magic of motion pictures. Films like ""Passion of the Christ"" and my personal favorite ""Transformers II,"" by my favorite director of all time, Michael Bay! Pure! Undiluted! Made in the USA Cinema! Un-molested by the past! And let no man say we don't have OUR modern intellectuals! We do! If we wish to ponder life's existence we have the beautiful films of the twin titans of cinema, Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino! Need I say more? Okay, I will! Sofia Coppola! There! I said it! See! Things were never better! I love it! You love it! We all love it! Thank you sir! You made my day, week and year!",1401235200,6,1217,4.970588235294118
8243850,1,B00124SNHK,"This flim (sic) is as surrealist as the hordes of so-called French Intellecuals who travelled to Russia in the 1930's and came back to France extolling the virtues of the Beast Stalin.
The movie resulted from badly digested youthful viewings by the flim's director of the  pretentious rubbish manufactured by the likes of Bunuel, Arabal and their offshoot Jodorowsky, these days only watched in film-schools, and fortunately immediately forgotten by most filmmakers, but of course not in the Land of the Franks.",1391904000,3,511,5.2317073170731705
8243851,5,B00124SNHK,"This is a unique film, one that's more a surreal painting come to life than it is your standard American style boring film. It was featured at Cannes and the Tribeca film festival. It's definitely worth checking out, though, and the on-screen debut of model and photographer Velvet D'amour (NOT ""THE VELVET UNDERGROUND"" PLEASE GET THIS RIGHT, AMAZON!) who plays ""Avida.""

It is unfortunate that the original poster art wasn't used for the American DVD, but I suppose that's because we Americans get silly when it comes to any nudity. But it's still a great film and I can't wait to buy it on DVD.",1201651200,8,596,4.6761904761904765
