8348411,4,B00205BUO8,"The subject of this fascinating documentary is the late Gray Barker. Barker was one of the first wave of what would later be called ufologists, people interested enough in ufos to write, correspond, and appear on radio and TV broadcasts. Like some of his contemporaries in the field Barker had somewhat of a cynical view of the subject as evidenced by the numerous hoaxes he was involved in.

The documentary is more than a look at Barker but also a look into Clarksburg, West Virginia in the 1950s. What emerges is a warts and all profile of a largely rural community and its relationship with Barker and the wider world that is slowly but surely encroaching.

The viewer will most likely identify with Jim Moseley, the gray haired man in sunglasses sitting at the bar. Moseley, although a good friend of Barker's, is not from West Virginia so his comments and observations are less parochial and come off as somewhat more objective. One of the funniest scenes from the film is the segment where one of Barker's friends is using a film from Barker to explain ufo propulsion intercut with scenes of Moseley explaining how he and Barker faked it.

The film has a lot of very nice touches which shows just how much can be done on a limited budget. The whole sequence with the tape recorder on Barker's gravestone is very powerful. The editing is really top notch.

Finally, the film seems to assume some knowledge of Barker and ufos from the viewer going in. If you are completely ignorant of the subjects this film won't make a great deal of sense.

The DVD itself is very much a homemade project. The DVD looks like it was from a spool bought at Walmart. Everything else also has that desktop publishing look about it. Nothing particularly wrong with this except for the asking price. Recommended, even at the high asking price, for those with an interest in ufos and the personalities surrounding the subject.",1309651200,2,1910,4.6895522388059705

8348413,5,B00205BUO8,"This film reminded me of the brilliance of early Errol Morris when he did ""Vernon, Florida"" and ""Gates of Heaven."" The director is able to capture the essence of the interviewees in a kind of portraiture that naturally and subtley grows more bizarre and grotesque with each word that they utter. As you watch it, the strangeness of the people slowly bubbles to the surface like sticky black tar; it made me think of David Lynch's oeuvre of wierd creepiness in small-town life resting right below the surface of things. I think the film's title contains an astute double meaning (which is representative of the film's general depth and intelligence): the film is certainly about flying saucers, but it also is about the small, strange whispers of existence that we sometimes encounter. I hope this guy does some more documentaries.",1238976000,6,830,4.935714285714286
