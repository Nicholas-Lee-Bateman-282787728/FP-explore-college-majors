A viewer can enjoy Jefferson's controversial biography set in one of the most  dramatic periods of American history, as well as the evolution of  collective and individual ethics related to slavery and human rights.",951091200,17,358,6.14

7860079,2,6304039824,"I admittedly have not seen this, but note the false claim in the description that a DNA study of claimed black descendants of Jefferson ""prove"" he was their ancestor.  Not true.  This was a study of Y-chromosome factors, and since Jefferson had no sons who survived beyond childhood, no such study of his direct white descendants was possible.  So instead a sample was taken from the descendants of Jefferson's brother, who was known to come to Monticello and pass the jug with the slaves, dance with them, and most likely was the one who fathered children with Sally Hemmings.

Much detail on the Hemmings case is gathered on websites such as the ""jeffersondnastudy"" which you can look up. See specifically ""The Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study as told by Herbert Barger, Jefferson Family Historian"". Barger, who was a part of the original DNA study group, documents the clamoring for personal fame by the physician authored the study that was firstly published in the British Nature magazine (editorially leftist). That physician also failed to give credit to others who participated in the study, but who disagreed with the physician's (and Nature's) distortion of the evidence. Barger also details a later critical review in Science magazine (politically liberal, but not leftist), which pointed out the inconclusive nature of the Nature claims. The DNA study was compromised by various vested interests -- a doctor seeking fame, leftists trying to slander Jefferson, and blacks trying to claim a part of history. Also look up: ""Thomas Jefferson: A Defense of His Character"" for additional important and censored historical detail.

Also viewers should ask, does this video cover Jefferson's aggressive attack against Muslim pirate strongholds in the Mediterranean, to rescue American captives being held for ransom by pirates in Tripoli?  If it did not mention these contrary facts about the DNA study, or Jefferson's strong stand against Muslim terror, then you can bet it was produced by leftist historians who tend to erase whatever they don't like from the history books.",1401494400,,2075,5.216216216216216
7860080,4,6304039824,"There are plenty of good presentations on Thomas Jefferson. You will also find them as part of other presentations on other key founding fathers.

This presentation however is unique in that it focuses on Thomas Jefferson and how he lived. We get to rebuild Monticello together several times. We get an in-depth vision of the Hemmings slave family including Sally Hemmings. We see the conflict between Jefferson and Adams from Jefferson's side. There are references to the Louisiana purchase and what this meant to Jefferson. There is particular focus on many of his paradoxes including slavery.

You may want to watch this after watching ""Thomas Jefferson: a film by Ken Burns."" Where Ken Burns thinks that Jefferson in a sense was frivolous and is constant changing of Monticello, this documentary sees it as part of his dynamic nature and compares it to the constant changing of the early government.",1389484800,2,903,5.053691275167785
7860081,3,6304039824,"""Thomas Jefferson:  A View From the Mountain""

This is a documentary, that seems to be focused on the ""dark side"" of Jefferson, yet it really fails to stress the inner struggle he endured regarding this issue of slavery.  It's a little hard to swallow in some respects, though it does illustrate the more human side of the man.  It's not the quality as Ken Burns' ""Jefferson"", and seems a little too focused on only one aspect of his life.

It's ok as a ""filler"" to some of the mystique surrounding this pivotal character, but will not be on my ""Highly Recommended"" list.",1354924800,,571,4.5588235294117645
7860082,3,6304039824,"I personally was expecting a broad view of Jefferson's life that talked about many things such as his birth, his marriage, his politics, including the revolution, his tenure in France, the Vice Presidency and of course the Presidency.

What you get is an hour long discussion on Jefferson's views on slavery, and not matter what the subject is it is always brought back to slavery. I expected slavery to be a part of this and an important part but not the sole focus.",1340323200,4,467,4.626506024096385
7860083,5,6304039824,"This is an excellent video on Thomas Jefferson and Monticello.  It is rather nice to take a brief vacation for the mind and watch this video of Thomas' gardens, home and inventions.  I wish I knew about the affordable dvd after I had purchased the affordable video.",1234742400,3,265,4.617021276595745
7860084,5,6304039824,"I found this jewel by accident while I was looking for films about mountain climbing. Well, that just goes to show you that life is indeed a box of chocolates. This piece requires a bit of work to chew but it's well worth the effort and I highly recommend it.

This documentary does an excellent job of revealing the path that led towards the manifestation of the truth: That all MEN, of all races, were indeed created with an inalienable and equal right for the free pursuit of happiness. It shows us the loss of this right is not the state of human existence desired by our Creator; but that it is instead a manifestation of the chains of tyranny which men themselves create.

 We are shown that outright slavery is only the most obvious example of the ways in which men are deprived of their freedom. The film describes how the seeds of this truth were sown in early drafts of the Declaration of Independence. It goes on to illustrate the necessity of preserving the existing social and economic structure, including slavery, so the nation could serve as fertile ground in which the tree of liberty would grow.

 This film indicates Jefferson recognized the process of ending slavery had to be one of slow change and compromise. TJ believed that proceeding in haste would have meant the destruction of the nation. The film leads me to admire the vision, perseverance, and honor of this extraordinary leader.

It concludes by revealing that even Jefferson was not immune to a far more subtle, far more pervasive form of tyranny that exists to this day: He died in debt - hardly the ""evil tax-evading capitalist slave owner"" that postmodern progressives would have us believe he was.",1200614400,21,1684,4.710884353741497
7860085,5,6304039824,"The Review by Ariafresca is misplaced. He is reviewing another film, not Thomas Jefferson: A View from the Mountain. He refers to actors and sets, but this film has none. What it does have is an unflinching look at America's oldest and most deeply-rooted moral equivocation, one that haunts us still today. The films's intelligence, thoroughness and honesty are constitute a rare find. How nice to be reasoned with rather than pandered to or berated.",1119398400,9,450,5.013333333333334
7860086,5,6304039824,"This documentary, written and narrated by Martin Doblmeier, focuses on Thomas Jefferson the slaveholder. It explores his feelings and actions, which often conflicted, regarding the institution of slavery. In my opinion, the film presents the material in an unbiased and nonjudgmental fashion that preserves Jefferson's position as a hero of the American Revolution and champion of freedom. It is an excellent film and a great companion to the Ken Burns documentary on Jefferson.",1101772800,13,478,5.561643835616438
7860087,1,6304039824,This is one of the poorest educational videos I have ever seen.  The set is unbelievably unimaginative and unattractive. m The actor who is pretneding to be Thomas Jefferson  talking about himeself (something Jefferson seldom did) looks like a character from a third rate farce--with a wig that doesn't fit and very little expression in his voice.  It is a wholly unconvincing and unpleasant portrayal. Don't waste your money on this one.,996537600,12,438,5.055555555555555
