1983722,5,B0001A7TQW,"My 3 year old boy LOVES this yoga exercise tape, starring kids!  He is so into it that we have brought all the related little yogi things from wai lana.

Making it interesting for kids every yoga pose starts with a little song and animation which are very cute and my son loves to sing along.  The children follow Wai Lana into the pose and it's all filmed on very scenic grassy beaches beside the ocean.

When my 3 yr old first started watching this video he would just sit on the couch fascinated, but now he actually gets into the poses (well his attempt anyhow!).

I do yoga at home with the Wai Lana exercise tapes every morning and he loves to try beside me, on his Little Yogi's mat.

Great fun and pleasingly educational.",1096070400,9,729,4.323529411764706
1983723,1,B0001A7TQW,Our children completely lost interest in this DVD within the first 5 minutes.  Wai Lana is actually kind of creepy and speaks soooo slowly--it's like she's on some kind of drug.  There are much better yoga DVD's out there for young children--this DVD doesn't seem to be very motivating at all.,1086998400,21,293,4.7254901960784315
8009094,5,B0001A7TQW,"When your almost 4 yo hype little boy asks you for his yoga dvd at least 1 time per day you know this is the one!!!!!! I got no words to describe how much my little one and myelf love this, we both get to our mats and exercise together (PRICELESS)",1456617600,,247,3.8627450980392157
8009095,4,B0001A7TQW,"We do  yoga in special ed. class.  I do not care for it but the kids love it.  I bought it for my grandkids, the four yr old loves it.  She packed it in her suitcase to take to a sleepover.",1446508800,,189,3.5365853658536586
8009096,4,B0001A7TQW,"My daughter loves doing Wai Lana's Yoga, At first, I thought Wai Lana was a little scary, weird make up and strange voice, but I'm over it.",1305936000,,139,4.185185185185185
8009097,5,B0001A7TQW,"I purchased these DVDs for my two year old son after he repeatedly requested the library copies. He is not ready for the yoga DVD, but enjoys the second DVD, which he calls ""Sleeping"". He is now 3 1/2 and still enjoys watching Wai Lana's friends in daydream time. I am giving a set to my niece and nephew, who are 4 and 6. My sister looks forward to using the ""daydream"" DVD to help them relax, and wind down.",1289952000,,409,4.125
8009098,4,B0001A7TQW,"I agree with other reviewers that the teacher's voice is a little weird, but the animations are great and the poses are kid friendly. I've found with other kiddie yoga videos that some of the poses are difficult, even for adults.",1239148800,2,229,4.609756097560975
8009099,4,B0001A7TQW,"I was tempted to order it on Amazon due to positive comments from other users and went to Youtube to look at a 3 min clip that someone has uploaded (The Balloon song) and heard Wai Lana's voice which I agree was kind of creepy...so I decided not to get it.  Then I came across a copy which was on sale at a local store and got it at around US$2 thinking that I had nothing to lose.  Went home, showed it to my two and a half year old boy, and he was fascinated and watched the whole video without stopping.  I then forgot about it and a couple days later, he asked to watch the ""yoga"" tape again!  I was surprised.  I realize that though Wai Lana's English is accented, her voice is actually quite soothing which relaxed me and probably my son.",1221177600,3,744,4.103448275862069
8009100,1,B0001A7TQW,"the woman in the narratin (no offense)
her voice is just horrible-
my kids cant stand it!",1189900800,,89,4.294117647058823
8009101,5,B0001A7TQW,"We got this when my daughter was about 3 or 4.  She is 6 now and still loves it.  It has made her more aware of her breathing, etc.  The reference to animals, the cartoons, and the children on the video make it fun, and Wai Lana's unusual accent makes her smile.  My daughter now knows the name of all the yoga poses.

Anything that encourages a lifetime of exercise and caring about your body is good in my eyes.  My son just turned 3 and is not as interested in it yet, but I think he will be soon.",1152748800,4,500,3.95
8009102,4,B0001A7TQW,"I initially was not impressed with this video.  As another reviewer mentioned, Wai Lana's manner of speaking reminded me of way the anesthetic affected my speech when I had a tooth extraction.

However, and much more importantly, my 4-year old son really enjoyed it.  He was very into watching the children do the poses, and seemed to be tuning out Wai Lana's voice since he never responded to her questions or comments, he was just focused on the poses.  Even his brother got down and started doing some of the poses, and that was a first.  He has run thru the disc several times on his own, and also had fun deciding the order in which he wanted to do the poses (a feature on the DVD, not sure if it's on the VHS if there is one).

I would recommend this DVD for a younger child just learning yoga.",1126915200,4,800,4.3
8009103,3,B0001A7TQW,"My kids (3 and 5) enjoy the VHS version of this product (the slow, thorough explanation of the poses plus the fun added my giving them kids names is great).  I even do it with them for some slow-paced stretches.  The DVD is the same poses split into 2 volumes.

The DVD idea is great, because it allows to just pick out poses, but dividing what was on the VHS into 2 DVDs makes it inconvenient and costly.  It should all be on one DVD.",1098489600,14,435,4.08235294117647
