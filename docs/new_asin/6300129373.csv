208344,2,6300129373,"just ok or 1.5 stars sorta like movie hydra and both weird, plain, cheap, too long, not enough monsta action. i remem 2 lil monsta scenes before the best part near end when it broke thru house at night w/ frogs in its mouth and that was it vs. the leave u hangin cave scene of eggs at end.",1246320000,,289,3.9152542372881354
208345,3,6300129373,"A man recounts a tale of his childhood when a legendary monster known as Rana by local Native Americans came out of the lake for vengeance.

In the end we have been treated to the tale of Rana and now the man will venture into the lake to look for the gold that the natives had offered as tribute to Rana.

The creature is a frog man (Rana means frog) and pretty unstoppable.  A pretty standard rubber suit creature that works as well as it does by never letting the audience get a good look at it.  The writing is about what one would expect from a very low-budget film (I especially liked when the scientist referred to frogs as lizards).

In a way, this reminded me of The Legend of Boggy Creek but without the documentary style.  But still we had the narrator return to his childhood haunts where he had encountered a monster.",1108684800,2,830,4.32258064516129

208352,1,6300129373,"CROAKED: FROG MONSTER FROM HELL (aka: RANA: THE LEGEND OF SHADOW LAKE) is about a giant, murderous frog-like creature, as told -in flashback form- by a man to his girlfriend. This, obviously, is an added, clunky way to explain the story to the viewer in voice-overs. As a boy, the narrator had an encounter w/ the huge amphibian. Meanwhile, a group of men, as well as a pair of beautiful, female campers, and an old man are also stalked, and / or killed. As a coherent monster film, C:FMFH makes little sense. It's pretty much just a series of monster attacks, separated by excruciatingly looonng stretches of mind-deadening dialogue, and dull, meaningless interaction between the various characters. It feels like three or four different movies were stitched together, forming this mutant, cinematic sludge! It's a bloody shame that a half-way decent, explosive finale was wasted on this donkey-log! Makes BOGGY CREEK 2 look like a work of brilliance! Another of TROMA's lesser offerings...",1436140800,,991,5.085889570552148
208353,5,6300129373,"I saw it on TV one time not in its entirety.  So I always wanted to see it again, to my disappointment it was never shown again. That is the main reason I bought it.  Again it was almost brand new.  Again I must reiterate, I love the horror genre.",1399075200,,247,3.9
208354,2,6300129373,"For those of you familiar with director Bill Rebane (""Monster a-Go Go,"" ""The Giant Spider Invasion,"" etc.) it's almost too easy to mock ""Rana: The Legend of Shadow Lake."" It has everything you would expect from a Rebane movie: a ridiculous plot, terrible effects, bottom-of-the-barrel acting, tons of padding, and perhaps the greatest credit sequence ever. But do not be fooled by its B-movie charms: it is a long, tough slog of a 1970s monster movie, and time has not been kind to it. Produced by multiple people including Rebane and Joost Von Oosterum, the film opens with a man and woman on a mysterious island in Wisconsin discussing a mysterious bone fragment. The film centers on ""Kelly"" (played by Glenn Scherer and Brad Ellingson) and involves a lot of flashbacks to when Kelly's dad and a boatload of other people were murdered by a frog monster when Kelly (Ellingson) was young. Just to remind you that this is a Rebane movie, there are tons of loose ends, opening with the most ridiculous death in a canoe I have ever seen. Random characters and dramatic interactions abound: there's loggers, scientists, and a crazy old man named Charlie, which just cried out to have Dub Taylor cast in the role, but instead we have to settle for Jerry Gregoris who turns out to be the best actor in the film.

The movie is enormously padded (paddling canoes and walking in the woods are specialties) and is unbelievably slow (unless you've seen a Rebane movie before, in which case it's wholly believable.) If the 125,000,000 year old fossil (really?) wasn't enough to kick start the plot, there's also a treasure on the island, and loggers and their petty turf wars to deal with. (Why not an insane asylum with a barber college? It's got every other imaginable subplot.) I wish it had the nuanced subtlety of ""Frogs"" with Ray Milland, but instead we have to settle for numerous flashbacks, people taking potshots at each other in the woods, and an amphibian poultry sacrifice. (A scene which I found genuinely deplorable.) This chicken sacrifice angers Charlie and the frog menace begins in earnest when the frogs...sit on the floor croaking. I was unable to determine how they were behaving differently than normal frogs in any respect.

What follows is a lot of grainy lurking in the woods, though there is some time for romance and pillow talk, too (""You don't look like any bass to me!"") This film also made me wonder if it's actually wise to feed a wild skunk at the kitchen table, although that issue was not explored to its full potential. (Sadly.) One serious question that I did find genuinely troubling was wondering how many animals actually were killed for this piece of ""art."" I fear the answer. About halfway through the film we learn the legend of Rana, the half man-half frog (and all cheese) monster when Charlie reveals the legend of the yellow pebble (what could it be?) Because there aren't quite enough unfocused plot diversions yet, Rebane offers us a very bad impromptu dance scene followed by a major frog infestation plotpoint with a cat as the lead investigator on the case. There are ludicrous fight scenes, more tepid dialogue, way, way more characters than required, and some of the most derivative music you'll ever likely hear on a soundtrack, all combining to heighten the boredom. Another (believe it or not, relevant) question: if you are looking for someone in the woods, why would you walk backwards? Why, so you can trip and find a skull of yet another expendable character, of course.

Eventually the plot got so tedious I gave up on paying very close attention, though I did learn it was wise to keep an ax in the kitchen at all times. Just like in other movies you may have seen before, a character destroys the only radio capable of summoning help, but for his pointless contribution to the plot he is rewarded with the single most staged fight scene in any movie ever, which all ends in tragedy after an attempted canoe theft. This in turn leads me to the most important question I had about the entire film: with all this going on around them, did anyone ever consider...oh I don't know...leaving? Finally a raft is employed when a dose of common sense arrives, although the ensuing scenes have a distinctly ""Land of the Lost"" feel (only not as scary.) Good looks at Rana are few and far between (you don't really see the monster until 78 minutes in,) but there is a nice bit of ransacking and mayhem involving Susan (Julie Wheaton) that is the payoff for having to endure her character through the vast majority of the running time. The film wraps up with two interesting explosions and details about how Rana reproduces (this is one of the lamest scenes I have ever seen in any movie,) a brand new subplot (!) about an underground cavern, and another brand new subplot about Susan's inheritance! What? Huh?

""Rana: The Legend of Shadow Lake"" is a terrible movie, from its various nonsensical plots running in numerous directions, its terrible cast (Angel Rebane even gets to play Baby Rana,) awful sound (some of the film is quite hard to understand,) grainy photography, to its disrespect for animals, this film has something for everyone to dislike. As a genuine work of art it has essentially no merit (though I did enjoy the stock footage of raccoons and skunks,) but if you're interested in this picture chances are good it's because you know about Bill Rebane. I gave it an incredibly generous two stars for people who want to see it for its camp value. It is certainly one of the most disjointed and hokey of all 1970s monster movies, but if you are interested in Bill Rebane you might find some enjoyment here, as there are many amusing displays of anti-art contained herein.",1348099200,,5726,4.728728728728728
