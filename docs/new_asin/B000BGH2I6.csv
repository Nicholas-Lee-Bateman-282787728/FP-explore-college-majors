8086302,3,B000BGH2I6,"I found the song ""A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square"" most beautiful, and when I learned there was a movie with that title, I just had to see it.

The movie is just so-so: based on a real high-yield bank robbery, with a novel ending. The title comes from the song appearing in the movie, along with scenes presumably shot in Berkeley Square.",1393545600,,344,4.4603174603174605
8086303,2,B000BGH2I6,"Although it's suppossedly based on a true story, it's hard to believe the robbery occured the way it's portrayed.  Security is non-existant.  If you can suspend logic then it's an o.k. caper film.  As a bonus you get to hear two versions of the titled song.  One the classic and the other a disco version.  There is also a cameo by John Rhys-Davies.  This is above average DVD for the money but the image quality is pretty bad.  The colors are dull and murky.  The sound is just o.k.
