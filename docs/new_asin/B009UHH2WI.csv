8544387,4,B009UHH2WI,"Set in the dark days of WW II we meet Martin Friedman who is a Slovakian Jew. He is a talented soccer player and he and his best friend are in demand at their local club. Meanwhile Hitler has been storming across Europe to leave a stain on the record of humanity. In Czechoslovakia the authorities were at first a bit reluctant to participate with their Aryan masters but slowly came to realise that resistance was futile.

The Jews start to be persecuted with the yellow star, confiscations and worse. The Jews are then told of these training or work camps where they can go to feel liberated and of benefit to society; some, despite the rumours, decide to volunteer to go to work in them. In the meantime those that know the terrible truth - or even part of it - are trying desperately to get out. Martin is one of those that volunteers and finds himself in a living hell where the only thing that keeps you from a worse fate is being useful.

We go through many stages of his story and there are a lot of players along the way. The period setting and acting are all exceptionally good as is the attention to detail. This is a true story of Martin's life and it makes it all the more heartbreaking when that is taken into account. There is some action - which is done extremely well, but this is first and foremost a drama so please ignore the misleading cover art. That is a drama of the highest quality that I find very easy to recommend.",1423267200,,1442,4.317343173431734
