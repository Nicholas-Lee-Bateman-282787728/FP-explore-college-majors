5231718,5,B00914YLAG,"I loved the movie.  So much so that I bought it through Link TV at a very expensive price, but it was worth every penny to support the station and the movie.",1349740800,6,157,3.90625
5231719,5,B00914YLAG,Thought provoking movie.  One of the best things is that it gives us hope that we can change things and get back on track.  So many documentaries just leave me feeling devastated.  This one is informative and engaging.,1349654400,3,218,4.684210526315789
5231720,5,B00914YLAG,"Of all the critiques of Wall Street greed and the harm it has done to communities, institutions and citizens, Heist stands out. The movie shows us clear ways of getting involved and organizing at the community level. I particularly like the way the movie cited the success of people in a California city to get a corporation to pay its fair share. This movie celebrates community empowerment and success.",1349654400,4,404,4.869565217391305
5231721,5,B00914YLAG,With good jobs hard to come by and an honest living even harder this movie explains why americans are in the mess we are in. More importantly what WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. This is what REAL PATRIOTS understand. Worth every penny and minute.,1349395200,4,235,4.363636363636363
5231722,5,B00914YLAG,"HEIST gives a complete look at how our current financial system turned its back on the majority of the American people to favor a select few. Starting with a secret memo in the '70s, HEIST gives a blow by blow of the things that followed to bolster the ""free market""- attacks on labor unions, the offshoring of jobs, the dismantling of Glass-Steagall so that banks could own the place, the rise of lobbyists in Washington, everything that's wrong with our economy today. If you're angry about the economy now, you'll be furious after watching HEIST. Enjoy!",1349222400,19,556,4.802083333333333
5231723,4,B00914YLAG,"For the Americans that are living in the midst of what the pundits ,politicians and mainstream media will not call a recession,I applaud""Heist""and it's honesty. At last,an unadultered,un- biased and fact based documentary that tells us the ""Truth,the Whole Truth,and Nothing but the Truth""
A concise and pertinent explanation re: ""How,Whom and Why"" the USA has had a ""Cataclysmic Economic Meltdown"".""Heist"" resolutely places the blame on those that were and are complicit in our economic crisis,;and what we,as Americans,can do to reclaim our country. Kudos to the filmakers! This DVD is well worth the price of admission.",1349222400,13,622,5.422680412371134
5231724,5,B00914YLAG,"HEIST - WHO STOLE THE AMERICAN DREAM is  the best doc that helps to explain the mess we have been in for the last 5 years, who started it and offers some possible solutions for getting us moving to a better society for everyone.  For me, the star of the film is Bob Crandall, former CEO of American Airlines who nails the greed of the 1%, stating for us all to hear loud and clear, that the price of a civilized society is paying  your fair share of taxes.  See it before you vote this election year and better yet, buy it, share it with your friends and family and fellow workers if you are lucky enuf to be employed and start the discussion going to see what you all can do to start  us moving towards a more equitable and fair life for all.",1349136000,45,743,4.096551724137931
5231725,5,B00914YLAG,"Most of us know that a form of dissimulation has occurred in our civic life, that the truth of ""for whom"" or ""why"" many major political/economic decisions are made are concealed from the general public.  We now see the revolving doors between DC, multinationals, and Wall Street;  but how did this happen, how did we get here?
Well this film, ""Heist: Who Stole The American Dream"" follows the ""plan"", the ""blueprint"" that has impacted our democracy, our economy, our sense of security and our illusions that this is a country where everyone has a fair chance and can have a good life; and our trust that our government is for the people and by the people.
It is a relief to actually see how this happened, because without this kind of documentation we can feel we are being a bit paranoid, becoming one of those conspiracy theorists, or that we are helpless against some larger unknown, unseen forces.  There's a power in seeing the truth.
Yet this film does not leave us in the position of feeling victimized, as the last third both describes and encourages grassroots actions mobilizing civic engagement on many levels.  Mirroring this belief in power through engagement the producers seem to have networked with many many organizations and professions to share the film ""Heist"" with them, again encouraging civic engagement. In many ways both the film and it's message are a clarion to all of us to reclaim our democracy and, by the way, our integrity. I think it is an important film for everyone to see; and I'm sure everyone that sees it will want to pass it on.",1349136000,76,1568,4.711678832116788
5231726,5,B00914YLAG,"I found the films very informative, and I was very impressed with the interviews. I thought it was very effective interviewing an ex CEO of American Airlines, who clearly understood the value of socially sponsored medical care.  Not least, the films moved along without any dull moments.",1349136000,30,287,5.1063829787234045

5231728,5,B00914YLAG,I watch a lot of documentaries and this is by far one of my favorites. In an hour and 16 minutes I got a real education on what has been happening to our country throughout my lifetime. You must watch this and have your eyes opened too.,1458777600,,236,4.042553191489362

5231730,5,B00914YLAG,"This is bipartisan truth, and it will amaze Americans to find that so many of those we elect actually are on the same side......OURS.  ALL of OURS as the Founders of the Constitution intended.  Everyone needs to see this now that we are in the election process.  I am old, and remember when elections were about IDEAS, and POLICY, and when the election was over, one candidate congratulated the other, and they worked together to strengthen America..........and the election did NOT go on for years and years and years.",1455494400,,519,4.808988764044944

5231734,1,B00914YLAG,"If you have a working knowledge of the subjects discussed in this film you will immediately recognize it for what it is, COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.  If you are not familiar with the subject matter, you may actually believe it, being that, it is artfully presented.  But, then, the devil is the master of lies.  That is what makes Communism dangerous, It sounds good to the masses who don't understand Communist propaganda. Those same masses will often fight to install it and then, too late,  they find out they have invited the devil in.",1440720000,,533,4.760869565217392

5231736,5,B00914YLAG,Excellent.  Everyone should watch this if you want an explaination as to how the Great Depression of 2008 happened.,1439856000,,115,5.052631578947368
5231737,1,B00914YLAG,"Heist blames lack of government regulation and corporate greed for the great depression and the financial meltdown when the real issue is both.  A long pro-Occupy Wall St. screed without good citation and admission that government entitlements are equally to blame for a lack of regulation.  Also fails to acknowledge that many of the ""experts"" the movie portrays are either career politicians who cheered on the debt crisis leading up to the financial meltdown in 2008, or 1%ers who act as if they're the above the broken system they support.",1439596800,,543,5.022222222222222
5231738,4,B00914YLAG,"This movie is astoundingly dishonest.  The repeated, parroted, evidence free claims that the Reagan administration engaged in ""deregulation"" are as embarrassing as they are entirely expected.  It's shameful that people can put out a whole documentary movie, with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to back their prime claims, and be taken seriously.",1438560000,,348,5.803921568627451
5231739,2,B00914YLAG,"Based upon other reviews of this DVD, I guess I had much higher expectations for a balanced documentary, or at least a liberal slant that was supported by persuasive facts.  I'd be ok with that bias, if I were expecting it, although I'd much prefer a balanced presentation of interviews and facts without an obvious political agenda (liberal or conservative).  I can make up my own mind if I'm presented a clear argument and all of the pertinent facts.  The critique of Ronald Reagan's showdown with the federally employed air traffic controllers union was a very poor choice as an example in support of unions, for example.  To most people (pro union or not), the ATC union strike was an obvious public safety and freedom of commerce issue, and a bad example of an arrogant, self centered union gone amuck.  If you want a liberal slant, a much more persuasive and academically rigorous one is provided by Robert Reich (a UC Berkley professor, former U.S. Secretary of Labor) in the documentary, ""Inequality for All"". It had self-deprecating humor, interesting & relevant facts and never insulted my intelligence.  The resulting presentation br Reich, in contrast, was much more persuasive in supporting a similar ideological conclusion.",1438473600,7,1237,5.03921568627451
5231740,5,B00914YLAG,"Some here in their reviews see this movie as Democrat VS Republican.  If they would stop following the media and $ propaganda that is put out by those with money who run the media, and just use this movie as a history lesson in what actually happened.  They will see it is NOT about one party vs another party.  It is about those with the most $ and influence rigging the system, our Country, so they can grow their wealth and influence at the expense of the citizens.  They don't care if the middle class dies off.  Power and rampant greed rules and shapes what we think because they control most of the flow of information and the enforce of laws.",1437782400,2,649,4.330578512396694

5231748,5,B00914YLAG,"We worry ourselves silly about threats from outside of what remains of our country. We often become so convinced that the rest of the world is a cattle roundup in need of our spurs and six guns that we fail to see the real threat. Those people with money, who have access to money and manipulate money are quite rapidly, and very effectively,  turning America into a Filene's Basement where the vast majority of us fight for the leftovers This betrayal is done in the name of patriotism, the Almighty or whatever current fraud attracts the most viewers to Fox News. People will argue until every bit of slander, nonsense and falsehood has been recycled. Sadly, the truth remains. We are absolutely bent on steering the ship of state headlong into an abyss of greed. This film points out clearly, and with little room for doubt, that those with the largest wallets will be the last to hit the bottom.

5231751,1,B00914YLAG,"Wow, scary!  I decided to read the Powell Memo before watching the movie, so I could understand what is presented in the movie.  I made it to 9 minutes and 30 seconds in the film when the narrator said that Powell had stated ""businessmen should use their financial muscle to shape the politics of the country"".  That sounded so unlike the reasonable tone of the Powell Memo, that I looked again to find this statement.  Help me out-- I don't see it anywhere.  Perhaps all the reviewers who mentioned this documentary is a great crash course on our country's events shouldn't trust what they hear without double-checking the facts!",1421452800,6,630,4.743119266055046

AND when they do tell the truth, they mix it with enough muck so that you'll never know where the real story is. This is propaganda, pure and simple. It's an evil attempt to rewrite history(Germany)like it has been done(Germany)in the past. However, if YOU believe that the only people with guns should be the police and the criminals, if YOU believe that other ""smarter"" <<(that's sarcasm!) should tell you what you're allowed to say... And think... And act; If YOU think that the government should tells us where to live, HOW to Live, whether or not there's a God, etc.... Then this is the movie for you!

5231758,5,B00914YLAG,"When I shared ""Heist"" with my high school economics class, the film's wake up call resonated with my students, many of whom faced an uncertain and unsettling future battling for scarce jobs. Heist is a terrific film to show your students, whether they be in high school or college, because the film explains what :30 second sound bites and tv clips can't possibly capture: the massive bail-outs of big banks that foreclosed not only on people's homes, but on their dreams of upward mobility. Viewers learn that while Congress was debating billions in bank bail-outs, the Federal Reserve Board was emptying over a trillion from our treasury. The robbery happened in the shadows, away from the press and the politicians, and it happened overnight; hence the fitting title, Heist. Not only does this excellent film detail the subprime mortgage meltdown scam, but it offers solutions to crony capitalism, exploring hopeful ventures in worker-owned companies and collectives. Kudos to the producers of this film for telling the truth.",1409529600,4,1029,5.167664670658683
5231759,4,B00914YLAG,"The Heist could have easily been made into a series that would delve in much more history and detailed analysis of what went wrong with the US economy in 2007 and 1929, so as to not just be mostly a documentary about America's frustrations with its aristocracy and its privatized and injurious monetary system, but to offer different solutions and ask daring 'what if' questions. What if usury is banned altogether by a Constitutional amendment and a one time 'jubilee' is engineered to annihilate all consumer and mortgage debt, for example. Thereafter we would conduct our economics with a stable currency such as gold and instead of the credit score we would espouse a savings score.

We could also bring our manufacturing back over time by insisting that every foreign-made product sold in the United States is properly labelled with an economic impact score. A EIS score of 0 would mean that outside of consumptive value the product brings no benefit to the US middle class economy and only benefits Walmart and their Chinese widget manufacturer. A score of 10 would mean that the product is of equal benefit to the US middle class economy, it's manufacturer, and their middlemen, whoever they may be. The rules of the market place would still apply and may the best product win, but we need a national consciousness about what we consume and how it affects our future. Every consumer product is also political. We should know who exactly is profiting from every product and by how much. We can have an efficient and productive economy minus an economic heist a minute.

Of note in the Heist is a short reference to Bill Clinton's role in the legalization of derivative financial instruments, the one blow that stands out among among all others as a presidential sign-off to a pillage larger than all other pillages throughout human civilization, combined. One has to ask, who did Bill Clinton think he was working for? If he had been a bus driver, and we were passengers on his bus, then he got paid to run us off a cliff. How much more corruption can we take?

Time for a major political revamp. No more ivory towers, no more usury.",1409184000,5,2139,4.744623655913978

This is a very comprehensive, informative movie that can help Americans understand how important a financially strong middle class is to a democracy and that billionaires, who take all the profits from a company do great harm to the economic stability of this country.

5231772,5,B00914YLAG,"Politics can sound boring and like two sides bickering.  Sometimes I think that's intentional so the average person will tune out as part of a strategy.  Government is us, or is meant to be us, ""we the people.""  ... but that has slowly shifted out of our control.  This documentary is intense and full of interesting proof YOU MUST WATCH to know why ""we the people"" will soon be irrelevant.  If we don't do anything, if we don't get involved, we will lose our government for good. HEIST is the perfect title.  Our government is being stolen from us, from we the people and the job is almost done.  It is not by accident.  it is a national strategy.  Even if you identify with the GOP ideas, you still will not want your say in government in the future, hijacked from you.  We are all being played!  Best documentary I've seen for a long time.

5231776,3,B00914YLAG,"The documentary spends way too much time on the Powell memo, which granted is important in understanding what has happened to the country, but one cannot do a truthful piece and ignore the rise of Chicago School neoliberalism, starting with the Nobel prize award to Milton Friedman in the mid-1970s.  It's his crackpot ideas, separate from the Powell memo, that have caused this country to teeter on the verge of ruin.  Furthermore, neoliberalism has been embraced by politicians and policymakers from around the world, and therefore what is going on in the United States is also happening in other countries.  To ignore Milton Friedman--he doesn't merit a single word in this documentary--is not understanding what really has gone on in this country.  Both political parties are now enamored not with the long-forgotten Powell memo, but with Milton Friedman crackpot economics.",1395532800,5,878,5.25
5231777,5,B00914YLAG,"I am a well-informed citizen, with a keen interest in American politics and economic history, but I was not at all aware of the true history exposed in this film, that should be required viewing by everyone.  The changes from a democracy where the government (or at least viable elements of it) were ""public servants"" to a corporate oligarchy where the government has become totally corrupted by the financial power of the corporations is not something that just happened, or naturally evolved, as it seemed. Rather, these filmmakers have dug deep and discovered the operational document, a blueprint written by Lewis F. Powell (later rewarded by being elevated to the Supreme Court), for the corporations to take over control of the government. A document that was bound in leather by Reagan and presented to all his cabinet and other regulatory commission appointees he hired, as their game plan for enhancing the influence of corporations at all levels of government, the media, and society, and for destroying the power of the people, particularly as represented by unions, from being an effective counterbalance to corporate dominion. This is not some hare-brained conspiracy theory, what Heist shows over and over again are the facts of how this blueprint was carried out, not only by Reagan, but by every succeeding President and Congress, as everyone became corrupted by the corporate money infusing itself into the system, regardless of party. This is powerful and sobering information, but, it does not come without hope, and some direction towards reclaiming our democracy and the American Dream. Very highly recommended.",1394928000,2,1632,5.229007633587786

What was best was that I teared up with hope in knowing that there are more of us citizens than corporations (1% of them and 99 % of us). We DO have the power.  We can't rely on politicians to look out for our best interests. We must raise our voices to expose the corruption and work together for our collective good.",1394841600,2,478,4.409090909090909

Just ending two wars that have lasted twelve years that have accomplished absolutely nothing but the loss of so many lives on both sides, billions of dollars squandered and countries destroyed.  A health care system for profit that many can't afford.  A government that can no longer function.  Jobs?  They've all been shipped overseas.

""Massive job losses, record home foreclosures, lost retirement savings.  The mess we're in today did not begin on Wall Street.  Long before the financial collapse, the dismantling of government and regulation was well underway.  Vast sums of wealth were already being channelled from the pay cheques and bank accounts of everyday taxpayers and into the pockets of the super-rich and corporate CEOs...

In a real-life development dwarfing the most elaborate conspiracy fiction, all of these consequences are the end result of a brilliantly executed coup.  Everyday human lives, the common dreams of people everywhere were never a factor.  All that mattered was profit.  Who did it?  How were they able to pull it off right before our eyes?  This is the story of the biggest heist in American history.""

The above is spoken by the narrator at the beginning of this powerful documentary, a documentary of reality at its most real.

In this film, we're told about such things as:

(1)  weapons of mass deception
(2)  the Reagan revolution
(3)  super tax cuts for the super rich
(4)  media manipulation
(5)  outsourcing middle class wealth
(6)  targeting retirees

There is actually very little narration but, instead, there are brief comments from significant others, archival footage, factoids printed on-screen, etc.  In other words, this documentary is never boring.  For me personally, I was riveted to the screen.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released to 2012) has two extras entitled ""for the 99%"" (20 minutes) and ""the sub-prime mortgage scam"" (15 minutes).

In conclusion, this documentary will stay with you long after you've viewed it.  I leave you with this riddle posed by one of this documentary's commentators:

""What's a four letter word that starts with an 'F,' ends with a 'K,' and stands for screw your workers?""

The film expertly explains what has been a 40 year shift from democracy to oligarchy (also the end goal of those the movie exposes), defined by the collusion of big business and government (and the toxic influence of money in politics)...and a corporate media that only serves to legitimize this shift, rather than expose and question it.

It provides solutions for working together, in a collective (we/us) strategy to regain and redefine what represents the American dream for many and not for the few (the 1% and those that aspire to be the 1%).

5231813,1,B00914YLAG,"I have rated The Heist with 1 star because it is replete with false and misleading information to further its purpose to convince those who do not know better that socialism is the solution to all of their problems.  It holds that socialist principles will prevent further erosion of the wealth of the 99% to the ""greedy"" 1% but does not acknowledge that greed is an attribute that applies to almost everyone to a degree.  It holds unions in high esteem (no greed here) and features socialist propagandists frequently.  It prefers more and more regulations to intrude upon our liberty, or what is left of it.  Its anti-competitive and anti-free market notions attack what made our country the greatest on earth.  It is critical of the high compensation of CEOs, but it does not mention the pay of professional athletes, movie stars, union bosses and former politicians that are wrapped in their own image and produce nothing.  Nor does it mention the failure of our education system as the result of failed parents, and teachers.  The education, intelligence, inventiveness and initiative of Americans are the sources of our success.  Are we to believe these qualities can be replaced by socialism?

The American government and its people as a whole have been living above their means and spending our wealth (borrowing for consumption reduces wealth).  Consumption of healthcare that comprises 17% of our economy does not help, particularly since so much of our healthcare system is used for prolonging life of the elderly in the final years of life.  (I am not suggesting we do not take care of the elderly, I am just stating a fact and recognizing that such expenditures reduce national productivity.)  Our legal system is also a non-productive consumer of wealth.  Now our remaining wealth is being transferred to peoples of other countries who will produce products and services at a much lower cost to American consumers than is possible to produce here.  It is natural for the flow of wealth to be redistributed to those who are hungrier and will produce more for less money.  Conversely, it is unnatural for wealth to be retained by those who produce less for more money.  Many products can no longer be made in America because they are too expensive to compete with lower cost goods from abroad.  Protectionist measures that unions and others have advocated will only hasten the elimination of high paying union jobs as well as good paying non-union jobs.  Unions have outlived their previous beneficial purpose.  While American productivity has been increasing, it cannot keep pace with global wage competition.  We will kill ourselves trying to compete without becoming much smarter about how we work and what we will make.  This film seeks to blame the wealthy for our problems, with not near enough blame assigned to our government, educational institutions, labor unions and ourselves.  We can increase taxes on the wealthy as demanded in the film, but this only soothes the jealous sense of ""fairness"" held by many.  If we increase taxes on the few wealthy significantly, they will use their influence for special provisions in the tax code to avoid more taxes.  Alternatively, they will move to a lower tax country.  We cannot tax the wealthy enough to buy or retain a standard of living for the vast majority of Americans.  We can only keep a reasonable standard of living by working much smarter than our competition.  We cannot survive economically by isolating ourselves and continuing to pay ourselves comparatively high wages and ignoring that our competition does more for less.  Unions tried to protect their high compensation and look what has happened to union jobs.  They have gone to other countries or to non-union shops and ""right to work"" states.  The hungry have eaten them for breakfast.  I also recognize that there are many Americans that do not think they have a high standard of living even though we have economic safety nets for those on the low end of the economic ladder.  However, I am principally referring to comparative living standards of our competition and while the living standards of Americans are not the highest, on average they are higher than those of the people of most countries that compete with us via much lower wages.

Touted as a star in this film is Bob Crandall, the former CEO of American Airlines who could not lead his bloated company through periods of higher competition.  American Airlines, with its high cost union labor was fat and ready for a fall, so Bob left with lots of money and now appears to be a wealthy nascent socialist in his later years.  I guess he blames his failure on someone else because he certainly did not acknowledge his past in the film.  He seems to have changed his mind concerning survival of the fittest.  I think his appearance was hypocritical at best.

I did not mention the cameo by Obama's buddy and former Czar of something or other, communist Van Jones.  He was even too far left for the Obama gang.  Van thinks we should all be like honey bees.  Communism is so nice.  However I would prefer to remain an individual and not a drone without identity.

Like the unions, our government cannot give up its view that our wealth is infinite.  So they keep spending and printing money from thin air which will only hasten our downfall.  The influence of money in our capital is indicative of the many that are there only to milk their positions for all they can, then escape and leave the American people holding the bag.  There is enough blame to go around for every person in the country to acknowledge some part in this mess.  It is not just the greed of the wealthy.

In the film,nave, but good intentioned, socialists want to revive our economy by putting people to work creating windmills and solar panels that are economically unviable.  What happens when the wind stops or when clouds obscure the sun?  I guess we will just spoil our environment with monstrous battery farms.  I doubt they will allow us to crank up the fossil fuel powered generators.  Wishing so does not make things work.

FDR was cited as the champion of the citizenry and he was praised for starting Social Security, unemployment compensation and government make-work programs.  However, SS was originally designed as a Ponzi-like scheme where current workers pay for the benefits of the retired.  It was never financially sound.  It's a shame because people depend upon it.  In the film, SS is said to have a funding surplus, so where's your money?  It's gone.  It was used to pay for other federal government spending.  Unemployment insurance was a good idea but benefits were never meant to be extended for years.  And today, make work programs can only survive in prisons.  The film also insists upon a return to defined benefit pension plans, but the unfunded status of existing defined benefit pensions has made it likely that promised benefits can only be partially paid.  The pension plans of the employees, including teachers, of the various states are underfunded by $750 billion with the states in the worst financial shape having the largest unfunded pension liabilities.  City pension plans are proportionately just as bad with even more city bankruptcies on the near horizon.  Detroit may be the first big one to go.

I have just pointed out a few of the many misleading areas of this film and have not even devoted time to our federal $1.2 trillion annual deficits and $16.6 trillion national debt which grows by $100 billion a month.  Our government is reluctant to take any meaningful action in this area because they do not want to admit their criminal fiscal irresponsibility and frankly, they do not know what to do because the problem is so big.  I am concerned that the hardship resulting from fixing this problem, or the greater hardship from not fixing it, will cause some Americans to reach for the false promises of socialism as painted in this film.  Europe has been socialist to a degree we never would have previously accepted in America.  The European countries are in much worse shape than we are.  I am hopeful we will learn from history and that sanity will prevail in America, but after seeing how our government is responding, I am not betting on it.  There are no easy answers, but a bigger socialist state is no answer at all.

As sobering as it can be to learn these things, the more we know, the less we have to live in fear....and the more empowered we become.",1355356800,15,315,4.322033898305085

5231822,5,B00914YLAG,"As president of a local union (UAW Local 737 - Nashville, TN), I had the difficult task of pointing out to the membership the alarming threats that are confronting the unions and disintegrating the middle class.  I wanted them to be aware of just how the insidious (and stealth) takeover of our government and public policy was not only directly responsible for the economic disaster we suffered, but has effectively displaced our democracy with a plutocratic rule that serves the interests and greed of big business.

Heist masterfully conveys this reality, as its clarion-like connection of the dots provides  a wake up call that can not be ignored nor soon forgotten.  Highly credible, widely-recognized authorities present the facts at a pace that is both comprehensible and riveting.  In our determination to mobilize the membership in preparation for the struggle that is before us, Heist is a most potent asset.",1354924800,16,918,5.134228187919463
5231823,4,B00914YLAG,"I rated it such for I no much more could have been revealed.
It was very educating to hear the source and start of the spiralling-down of the economy. This is how simply history should be made plain in school text-books straight to the point! Yes, I would recommend it.",1353456000,4,269,4.4

5231826,5,B00914YLAG,"This powerful, enlightening and funny movie shows step by step how our country got into such a terrible economic crisis.

Starting from over forty years ago, the movie documents, with historical photos, news reels and newspaper headlines, how the downfall of the American dream was not an act of the supposed invisible economic hand, but that of named individuals and organizations of the 1%.
Also shown are the effects of the crisis, but more inspirationally, the efforts to overcome the crisis, and stop the Heist.

Throughout there are funny animated transitions and send ups of the bad guy big shots.",1350000000,2,604,5.03

8533705,1,B00914YLAG,"Disclaimer- I am fairly liberal and have been on a kick watching corporate malfeasance documentaries on the financial crisis. I am surprised at all the good reviews for this documentary because I could not stomach watching this film past the first 20 minutes. This is pure propaganda and poses a distorted version of the truth. I was hoping that this would be a more balanced, educational film- unfortunately, the film does not posit enough substantiated facts and from the onset sets a narrative that is clearly biased, which ultimately discredits some of the potentially valid points it may bring up (I wouldn't know...I didn't finish the film).",1465689600,4,647,5.05607476635514
