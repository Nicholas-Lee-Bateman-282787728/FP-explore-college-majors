8148777,5,B000J2GUBM,"Jack Herer had to fly across the country, to find the original master files of this Hemp For Victory Campaign - which had been illegally omitted, from all computerized files. Chief Information Officers formally insisted that this film was a hoax. JackHerer.com proved them wrong: that's why and how this is authenticated in our National Archives, today.",1448236800,,353,5.2105263157894735

8148779,5,B000J2GUBM,"Calling this a marijuana movie is incorrect. It's a movie about hemp, not marijuana. Both from the Cannabis plant with completely different uses.",1424563200,,145,5.3478260869565215

8148781,4,B000J2GUBM,"I graduated from college with a major in history, specializing in military history, and I am constantly amazed by what I don't know. I never would have known about this video if not for the History Channel and to find out about the lengths the government went to in an attempt to destroy all evidence of it after the war. Thank God for the Library of Congress for preserving it. It actually has real information about the beneficial uses for hemp rather than just the DEA' s view. A very good informational video that can be used today.",1418515200,,536,4.479591836734694

8148784,5,B000J2GUBM,"This little government film is a great way  to begin the business of learning the truth about cannabis - (marijuana, hemp, etc.). I grew up in the hippee era with zero interest in smoking anything or doing drugs. Fast forward decades later and having watched a number of friends and loved ones suffer needlessly for want of a harmless yet effective natural pain and illness relief I found it essential that I educate myself about this incredible plant. Especially so due to it's extraordinary healing and industrial benefits - Think of it, a plant that grows like a weed, can be used for food, fuel, clothing, building materials and needs NO petroleum or other types of pesticides! Clearly the industrial espionage inherent in the ""drug war"" is clearly seen. But I digress. This little film is a tiny part of the proof that our very government, you know, the one that supports the greed of the corporate elites over We the People and the law has known for a very long time the countless benefits of this amazing God-given plant. Will spare you a rant, but if you enjoy old, wartime memoribilia and the truth over the current propaganda about marijuana, it's a must for your collection.",1345593600,5,1185,4.72463768115942
8148785,5,B000J2GUBM,This short documentary was referenced in another film we saw.  It is just amazing to me that the government was once pushing hemp (and that even back then corporate interests took over and outlawed hemp).,1284249600,5,204,4.828571428571428
