8169337,3,B000MIH1UM,"This tape shows three shorts of which only one is a laurel and hardy film. the first film on this tape is a shortened version of our relations called twin trouble, if you've seen our relations than skip it.  the second film shows charlie chase and co-stars Billie Gilbert as a nutty doctor. the third stars thelma todd and Zasu Pitts.  I thought all three films on this tape would show laurel and hardy but i was wrong.  I did not like twin trouble at all but i kinda liked the other two shorts.  If you've seen oue relations and you want to see a tape that only stars stan and ollie than skip it.",1397779200,,597,4.165217391304348
