1741360,5,B00006AW7H,I am a huge fan of this movie and of Tinto Brass. I love the way its filmed and it could of had more male nudity. I love Tinto Brass,1326585600,2,132,3.433333333333333
1741361,2,B00006AW7H,"I've seen most of Tinto Brass's movies now.  He's basically a one-trick pony, but he does that trick well enough that I keep looking for one of his movies that might be good.  Black Angel isn't it.  Typically, it contains a few erotic scenes and the attempt to create a background for these undermines any other value that the movie might possibly have had.  The film's foreign title is Senso '45 and is based on the short story Senso, which you can read about online to find out the plot of this movie.  There isn't any message here as far as I can tell except a nihilist one that leaves you thinking the characters are all either shallow and depraved or fools or both.  Despite the costumes, there isn't any historical context or drama connected with the war.  One extra star for Brass doing his one trick adequately.",1324080000,17,819,4.493243243243243

1741383,2,B00006AW7H,"ew. I have a tolerance for some weird stuff and I rather enjoy foreign, subtitled movies, but this was BIZARRE, predictable --except for the scene with a dancing chain of drunken Nazi men and half naked women, with the lead woman wearing a giant golden dildo. GIANT dildo. Even THAT didn't make this movie interesting. I managed to finish the film and then wished for those 2 hours and 8 minutes of my life back.",1449792000,9,412,4.506666666666667

1741389,5,B00006AW7H,"Film (5/5) Reviewing the Blu-ray Release by Cult Epics. This is a beautiful transfer and a flawless example of perfection in creating a new outlet for this Tinto Brass erotic classic. Cult Epics is a master at bringing out the goods.

This is a drama mixed with romance and the underlining currents of a thriller. Nazis, World War II and the Gestapo. The concept of Nazis is always a touchy subject to deal with.

Directed by a true cinema master Tinto Brass. Tinto Brass is a phenomenal and extraordinarily amazing director. He is able to capture the undercurrents of history mixed with an erotic nature. His films are a mixed bag of ideas with real-life drama, eroticism, comedy and sometimes a haunting thriller.

He not only directed, Black Angel, he wrote Black Angel, edited Black Angel and even had an uncredited acting moment in Black Angel. Many people will know him from his earlier works, all basically dealing in some sort of erotic comedy nature. He did principal photography on Caligula one of the greatest epic films of all time.

Black Angel is not only an erotic must see, it's a beautiful piece of cinematography and historical reality. This film has a sexual nature yet it is a thriller and heavy on drama. Black Angel is able to hold the viewer from beginning to end as you experience the extraordinary relationships in this film.

This is a dark and haunting and extremely unforgettable film. Starring the beautiful and amazing Anna Galiena and the sexy striking Gabriel Garko.

Originally titled Senso '45 it was titled Black Angel for the international release. This is a stunning erotic gem of cinema that I feel is a truly logical and historical piece that is relevant in all its ways.

Believe it or not this is actually a remake of the 1954 Italian film Senso. Senso was adapted from Camillo Boito's Italian novel. The 1954 version was directed by Luchino Visconti. The 1954 version was at one time supposed to star Marlon Brando but it did not follow through with the idea. Tinto had read the story and watched the original movie which he personally felt did not give the story justice so he wanted to make a movie using the original story and idea just twisting and turning the plot by placing the situation in Nazi Germany during WW2, where as in the original it was set in the War of Unification.",1426204800,12,2327,4.688725490196078
