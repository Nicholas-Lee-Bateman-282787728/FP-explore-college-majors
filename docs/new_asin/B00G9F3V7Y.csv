8621426,4,B00G9F3V7Y,"Shimmer Volume 55 had some okay matches, good matches, and great matches. Here are the following:
1. Jessie McKay vs Yuu Yamagata: 3/5, an okay opening match, nothing impressive but not bad either.
2. Thunderkitty vs Allysin Kay: 2.5/5, This was probably the worst match on the card. Slow-paced, kinda boring, mostly due to Thunderkitty who didn't do anything impressive really, I would skip this match.
3. Heidi Lovelace and Santana vs Jessicka Havok and Sassy Stephie: 3.5/5, good match while it lasted, should've been longer. I believe this was Heidi's Shimmer debut.
4. Christina Von Eerie vs Saraya Knight: This was an intense match with Saraya and Christina really going at each other, good storytelling. 4/5
5. Athena vs Taylor Made: A really good, competitive match with both women trading moves and submissions. 4/5
6. Canadian Ninjas vs Veda Scott and Shazza Mckenzie, Tag title match. An okay title match. Veda is still pretty green but the Ninjas carried her well. 3/5
7. Mschif vs Kalamity: A decent match, thought it could've been given more time but it was still good and the two showed respect to each other. 4/5
8. Regeneration X vs 3G: A fun tag team match that was definitely better than the other, everyone worked hard here. 3.75/5
9. Madison Eagles vs Kana: Great match here. This was a very submission based match but both women hit various moves with Eagles hitting a brain buster and German Suplex while Kana hit some kicks, dropkicks, and a Neckbreaker. One of the best on the card. 4.75/5
10. Hamada vs Mercedes Martinez: Another great back and forth match. Hamada hit some high flying moves and Mercedes hit an array of suplexes. 4.75/5
11. Shimmer Title match, Courtney Rush vs Cheerleader Melissa: I am not a fan of Melissa at all but regardless this was an outstanding match that I felt also should've been longer, but still and Courtney proved why she deserves to be champion in this match. 5/5
Overall a good Shimmer DVD and I would recommend it to any shimmer fans.",1392163200,,1998,4.777456647398844
