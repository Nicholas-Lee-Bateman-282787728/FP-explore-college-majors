3692583,5,B001M5BFA6,"I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I SAT DOWN TO WATCH THIS DVD HOW THEY BUILT THAT? ""SCHOOL BUS"" WITH MY GRANDAUGHTER.  NOT ONLY WAS SHE FASCINATED BUT SO WAS I. I NEVER REALIZED WHAT IT TOOK TO PUT TOGETHER A SCHOOL BUS. I WAS AMAZED.  EVERY TWO MINUTES MY GRANDAUGHTER WOULD SAY WOW GRAMMY LOOK AT THAT. THE DVD HELD OUR INTEREST THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF BUILDING THE BUS. I HAVE SENT THE DVD TO MY OTHER GRANDCHILDREN WHO ALSO LOVED IT. THEY HAVE NOW TAKEN IT INTO SCHOOL FOR THEIR WHOLE CLASS TO ENJOY. TWO OF MY DAUGHTERS ARE TEACHERS AND THEY PLAN TO PASS IT AROUND THE SCHOOL FOR THE OTHER CLASSES TO SEE. THANKS FOR A GREAT EDUCATIONAL AS WELL AS ENJOYABLE DVD.

3692584,3,B001M5BFA6,"although i am a school bus driver & an avid school bus collector. this video was quite enjoyable for the informational & visual aspects, but there was a lot of subjects not covered. and there should've been a video of all the types of buses that International builds.
i would recommend this dvd to anyone, it's not bad, very enjoyable.",1250553600,,335,4.6
3692585,5,B001M5BFA6,"The School Bus video by Marvelous Media is simply fabulous.  My 3 year old confiscated his cousin's copy during a visit.  He would much rather watch a ""How'd They Build That"" video than cartoons any day.  It even keeps the adults interested with the Fun Facts and process explanation.  We love the video format, explanation and background.  The IC plant and detail keep him interested as he awaits his turn to ride the big school bus.  Great length, detail and previews of others available.  We look forward to seeing more and highly recommend the product.",1245974400,4,556,4.7894736842105265
3692586,5,B001M5BFA6,The process is amazing and interesting.  You will enjoy this video and you are sure to learn a lot. Marvelous Media does a great job summarizing and sequencing the process in an educational and attractive format.  You will be so impressed with the people and the processes in this school bus manufacturing plant.  You may enjoy it just as much as your children!,1240963200,3,361,4.698412698412699
3692587,5,B001M5BFA6,"This is a very well made video, and it shows you the process from start to finish of IC's School Buses.  I'd recommend it to anyone who has an interest in school transportation, people in school transportation, and all kids that are curious about how a school bus is made.  It's filled with fun facts about school buses; like school buses are made in 36 different lengths (as seen in the video preview on amazon.com).  There's also a history with the building they build their buses in; you'll find out when you watch this video.  You can't go wrong with this plus it's under $10!!",1238544000,6,581,4.504761904761905
3692588,5,B001M5BFA6,"These are some of the best educational videos available. I love learning about how products are constructed and these videos do a fabulous job of letting viewers in on the entire process. What better vehicles to feature than two of the most recognizable ones on the road? All children are familiar with both the school bus and the concrete mixer!

Did you know most of the school buses in North America come from a single company? Neither did I! School Bus takes us to the IC School Bus Factory in Oklahoma, home of the big yellow machine. We get to see every step of the build, from the raw materials right through to the welding and painting. How many buses would you guess they are getting road ready? Would you believe 50 to 60 per ten hour day? That explains the constant
stream of school bus yellow on the roads.

Concrete Truck is a pretty cool machine. Concrete is the most common man-made building material on earth, with 9 billion tons of it being made each year. The transport vehicle necessary to get all that concrete to the job site? We visit McNeilus Concrete Truck Factory in Minnesota to get the low-down on how concrete mixers are built and how they actually work. Get a first hand look at each stage of assembly, from nuts & bolts to watching concrete pour down the chute. Concrete mixers are one of the heaviest vehicles on the road and building one is no small process.

Each video in the series follows a winning formula that includes a visit to a specific factory, informative narration, catchy background music and a plethora of interesting facts. Factory tours are always so well done, that viewers feel they are taking the tour in person, from the comfort of their own own sofa. Recommended for age four and older, these are definite winners!",1238284800,5,1768,4.606349206349206

3692610,5,B001M5BFA6,"my grandson (3.5) will pick these first out of all the kid videos Even when he is interested in some new release, he rarely plays it again.

Now if I can only find a little school bus toy to accompany the video.  Anybody know of one?  He does like duplos, I wonder if they have one.",1392854400,,284,3.5161290322580645
3692613,5,B001M5BFA6,Exactly what I was looking for!! I have toured the factory in person and everything on this DVD is exactly how it is in the actual factory. They don't have a video available when you take the factory tour so this one serves as a great memory of the tour.,1374969600,,254,4.1

3692617,5,B001M5BFA6,"This video, along with the others in the series (School Bus, Big Truck, Garbage Truck and Concrete Truck) have kept my boys busy for hours and hours. I have three boys, 3 and 5 and 6, and they all sit glued to the tv watching the different scenes over and over (don't worry, I do give them breaks!). The scenes are all fun and the boys can't get enough of the sounds, the dirt and the BIG TRUCKS. These videos were totally worth the money and I recommend them. The kids love to see how things are made and how things work. :-)",1272844800,,526,4.116504854368932

8320465,5,B001M5BFA6,This video has been our sons favorite for almost 2 years. He's fascinated and will watch it over and over. After borrowing it from the library countless times we gave him his very own copy for Christmas! He's almost 5 and it's great to see him pick up on new parts of the video then he used to and our local buses have the IC logo that the video refers to so finding that logo is always a highlight when we are out and about. (It's great when simple things are so much fun!),1453161600,,474,4.053191489361702
