8054464,5,B0007Z0OBI,"Excellent collection of classic movies.  The best movies in the set are: He Walked by Night, the true story of a cop killer with a unique twist; Quicksand, a man who borrows one too many times; The Man on the Eiffel Tower, an innocent man is framed for a murder he did not commit, while the true murder plays games with the police, this one is a must see; Scarlet Street, one too many  thefts leads to a series of murders; Ransom Money is a hokey 1970's movie with a weird plot line, but I have to say that it is an good movie.",1367280000,,527,4.0576923076923075
8054465,4,B0007Z0OBI,"This is one of the best DVD purchases I've ever made. For less than six bucks (when you figure in shipping), I got a 20-pack of film noir and suspense classics, with such gems as THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER (Charles Laughton as Inspector Maigret), SUDDENLY (Frank Sinatra as a would-be presidential assassin), PORT OF NEW YORK (has to be one of Yul Brynner's first starring roles), and my two favorites so far, THE STRANGER (a lesser-known Orson Welles movie starring Edward G. Robinson) and, on the other end of the spectrum, the movie I'm watching tonight, JAIL BAIT, written and directed by Edward G. Wood.
Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed: the quality of the transfers is FAR from HD quality (some of them are from old prints, like the quality you'd see on an afternoon or late night UHF movie feature, with fuzzy sound, choppy edits, etc).
But if you're like me and sometimes you just want to veg on the couch watching an old movie, this set is MORE than worth it.",1331942400,,984,4.533707865168539
8054466,3,B0007Z0OBI,"British Intelligence
1940 spy story featuring Boris Karloff as Valdar, a butler working in the household of a British Cabinet minister.  The film captures the frustration of British intelligence as every strategic move they make seems telegraphed to the German high command and British Intelligence tries mightily to plug leaks in their security apparatus.  Be prepared for a maze of double crosses as you solve the riddle of who works for whom.

Suddenly
Frank Sinatra leads a cadre of gunmen trying to knock off the President of the United States as Sterling Hayden trys to talk him out of it.  Sinatra is believeable as an unstable triggerman beyond redemption in a film that predates JFK's assassination by 9 years.

Jigsaw
This is the film gem of the package, staring Franchot Tone as DA Howard Mulloy investigating the murder of journalist pal Charlie Riggs (Myron McCormick).  How Charlie, a street tough beat writer, allows himself to walk into a setup strains our credulity, but after that, Tone is relentless following the clues no matter how off balance.  The film print is edgy, capturing images with low key lighting and portraiture of Tone that has an Orson Welles look and feel.  Worth multiple viewings.

He Walked By Night
Police docudrama covering Los Angeles in the early 1950's.  Jack Webb has a small role as a police researcher.  Vivid use made of LA's underground aqueduct system as a police dragnet tries to stifle a cop killer.

Quicksand
Mickey Rooney as auto mechanic Dan Brady can't catch a break and gets shaken down time after time for bigger and bigger stakes in another didactic classic intended to show ""what a tangled web we weave when at first we do deceive.""  He pulls a gun on a motorist who turns out to be a kindly lawyer (whew!).  When he ditches femme fatale Vera Novak (Jeanne Cagney) and reunites with his loyal admirer Helen (Barbara Bates), we know there's hope down the road and he'll get the shortest prison sentence possible.

Eyes In The Night
The eyes in this 1942 war era film belong to Friday, an amazing German Shepard in the employ of blind Private Detective Duncan Maclain (Edward Arnold) who after a local murder, stumbles on a Nazi plot to steal top level scientific secrets.  Donna Reed co-stars as a strong willed daughter determined to live her life without interference from an overbearing mother.  German spies may have won the Iron Cross, but Donna Reed gets off a memorable right cross during the pivotal fight scene.

The Man On The Eiffel Tower
The second film in the package featuring Franchot Tone.  Charles Laughton as Inspector Jules Maigret seems to be in over his head against the brilliant psychopath Johann Radek played energetically by Tone.  Radek suffers from hubris, the sin of pride, a feeling he is too fleet afoot for the seemingly dull witted Inspector, who is humbly setting his own traps sprung with  breathless vistas of the Eiffel Tower as backdrop.  Burgess Meredith directs, acts, and as a man framed for a murder and trying to clear his name, attempts a daring citizen's arrest.

The Reign of Terror
Consumers were supposed to get a film called The Black Book, but through a slip up, we are instead treated to this Anthony Mann 1949 effort about the French Reign of Terror.  Mann expertly adapts his film noir methods to a historical subject.  The camera angles are well framed, the print is rich and moody, and the dialog is suitably terse.  ""I don't blame you for hating me.""  ""I don't hate you.  I just don't care anymore.""  Star Robert Cummings abandons comedy in favor of a role as Charles D""Aubigny, sent by the Marquis de Laffayette to prevent Maximillian Robespierre from becoming Dictator of France.  Mann was one of the great directors of his era, this film shows why.

They Made Me A Criminal
John Garfield of The Postman Always Rings Twice fame stars in this 1939 film as middleweight boxer Johnny Bradfield who is framed for a murder he didn't commit.  He goes underground, re-emerging in the Depression era Arizona countryside, at a home for wayward youth.  He becomes a role model for the teenagers, although past and present merge when suspicious New York gumshoe Monty Phalan (Claude Rains) turns up at a local boxing event, and has it in mind to bring Johnny back to New York to stand trial for murder.  Academy Award winning cameraman James Wong Howe (The Rose Tattoo, Hud) did the cinematography and made the film notable for its authentic depiction of Depression era road scenes.

Algiers
Warner Brothers executives invoked this movie when they received a film script named Casablanca.  They saw that script as a sequel to this film.  Pepe le Moko (Charles Boyer) is an international criminal hiding out in the Casbah of Algeria and wanted for extradition to Paris.  The police want to use stormtropper tactics, but Inspector Slimane (Joseph Calleia) deploys a more subtle ruse to extract him involving a beautiful Parisian played by Heddy Lamar.  Boyer turns on the tough guy charm, but Lamar, while georgeous, is nonetheless icy and distant.  As a pair, they have less complexity than Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. Dependable cinematography by legendary cameraman James Wong Howe.

The White Orchid
Peggy Castle is a magazine photographer with no sense of when and when not to raise a camera; as such, unqualified to accompany an expedition into  South American jungle -  which means the foray is a go.  As abiding a knowledge of local custom as is shown by the British in Sundown, this party shows only ignorance and disrespect.  Ms. Castle is about to reap what she sowed when she gets rescued by a contrived ending.

Port Of New York
Yul Brynner is the slickly demonic leader of a waterfront syndicate involved in drug trafficking.  In addition to a full head of hair, he has a willingness to wipe out anyone opposing him.  The tension is finely tuned as Brynner blows the cover of G-men sent to infiltrate his operation and there's no sugarcoating - then as now - it's dangerous work.

Outpost In Morocco
This film features George Raft, who became famous for turning down roles taken by Humphrey Bogart. His character is content to curry favor with women; even military officers refer obliqly to his amorous exploits although when they happen, they seem wooden and passionless, Raft's character merely content to carve another notch on his belt.

Detour
With its hitchhiking theme, Detour is paired well in this package, yet it too suffers from the same drawback as The Hitchhiker, an unrelenting brutality, this time from a female character, and the effect is the same: a monochromatic performance bordering on unwatchable.  Detour at least, is redeemed by a story line more complex than Hitchhiker but ends abruptly with no real solution to the concepts it introduced.

Jail Bait
Blackface comic Cotton Watts and his wife make an appearance in this 1954 film when crooks want to steal theater receipts.  Watts entertained in Panama Beach, Florida clubs until 1959.  The husband-wife dialog is insipid, but Watts' dancing has distinct Michael Jackson parallels - the Moonwalk, the hip swiveling half steps, its all here. Musical score by Hoyt Kurtain is very good, camerawork OK, but the acting is substandard.

Ransom  Money
Made for TV drama that even comes with TV music, which has less tension than elevator music.  Lamentable acting in an even more lamentable script as police and victim spend most of the movie yelling at each other instead of working together to solve a kidnapping.

Sundown
Gene Tierney is a knockout in bare midriff and white brassiere; the film probably made it past censors because this is a British movie with a war time theme.  Tierney is a British agent flown into Kenya aiming to stifle incipient tribal warfare by German supported fighters in Kenya.  Although she is just developing her acting style here, three Academy Award nominations were given for art direction, cinematography and musical score.  Sir Cedric Hardwick sums up the proceedings in a bombed out London cathedral, reminiscent of the film ending in Mrs. Miniver.

Dangerous Passage
So damaged, scratched and defaced, it's difficult to enjoy this film.

The Stranger
Edgar G. Robinson plays a determined investigator, Mr. Wilson, who works for a UN  War Crimes Tribunal determined to break up a ring of former Nazis and bring them to justice.  The trail leads Wilson to a small Connecticut town where he must convince Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young) that she has married his prime suspect.  Noteworthy for its probe into the predictive power of behavioral psychology and the influence of the subconscious.  Contains many of the features that made an Orson Welles film special:  interplay between light and dark, tight camera angles, understated articulation of deep philosophical principles.  A slip up by the copyright holders allowed this film to fall into public domain.

Scarlett Street
This Fritz Lang effort also stars Edward G. Robinson as artist and painter Cris Cross living a humdrum existence while working as a cashier for a wealthy business owner.  Joan Bennet stars in husband Walter Wanger's 1945 production as Kitty, an amoral girl of the streets who, together with boyfriend Johnny (Dan Duryea) hustle Cross out of his paintings which turn out to have authentic value.  Even though released in 1945, the film has the quality of a 1920's era movie.  It's washed out in part, full of contrast, with streaks and other glitches.",1307664000,4,9467,4.91997479521109

8054469,3,B0007Z0OBI,"SUSPENSE 20 MOVIE PACK is a star-studded collection of some of the better public domain edge-of-your-seaters presently available.
