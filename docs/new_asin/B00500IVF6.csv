4511140,5,B00500IVF6,"I can't add much to the favorable reviews that have already been written, but I did want to do something to spread the joyful news of another movie by the crew that brought us the ""Lost Skeleton"" movies, as well as ""Dark and Stormy night.""

I would agree with one reviewer that the repetition of the title song was not effective.  It slowed things down, although the way it was performed by the singer was a lot of fun.  I'd still give the whole enterprise 5 stars, however.

In addition to the wit, this movie has a great deal of gentle charm.  I'm glad the folks who made it saw fit to do so.",1357344000,3,594,4.175438596491228

4511142,4,B00500IVF6,"This one is not as comical as some of Larry Blamire's other films. But it is an enjoyable parody, with his usual excellent casting.",1355616000,,131,4.5
4511143,4,B00500IVF6,"This sequel to The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, featuring the same cast (even if their characters were killed off) is either as funny, funnier, or only slightly less funny than the original depending on your mood. I'm going with slightly less funny but it still delivers the goods. Writer/director/star Larry Blamire looooooooooves cheesy fantasy movies and it shows in every frame, every music cue, every insane gag. What's more, he knows how to guide actors into that perfect pre-method-acting groove and keep them pitched perfectly. Think of it as a musical but without the songs and WITH giant trilobites.",1348272000,,606,5.1313131313131315
4511144,4,B00500IVF6,"First, you'll need a Region 2 friendly DVD player to watch this.  It was never released in America/Region 1 and after watching this movie it is easy to see why.

I'm a big fan of Larry Blamire's films but this movie feels unfinished compared to all of the others.  Various set pieces are pretty humorous but the movie never really gels into a cohesive whole.  Lots of bits are repeated, the worst offender being the eponymous theme song.

However its not all bad.  Larry Blamire knows his B-movies and the parody is as sharp and spot on as ever.  All the repertory players you know and love from the Lost Skeleton films make an appearance and do not disappoint.

4511145,5,B00500IVF6,"If you are a fan cheesy 1950's & 1960's sci-fi flicks, you have got to see ""Trail of the Screaming Forehead"", a belly-laugh homage/parody of the genre.

The basic story is that two sailors taking a break from transporting some frozen cadavers upriver stop off in the sleepy little town of Longhead Bay. Unfortunately, they've chosen the exact moment of an alien invasion for their few days of relaxation.  Oh, and I guess I should mention the invading aliens look like human foreheads. At the same time a scientist is conducting forehead experiments on her love-smitten assistant. The scientist believes all knowledge actually resides in the forehead instead of the brain.

The movie is so goofy, but so well written that you will find yourself chuckling throughout. There were quite a few laugh out loud moments, and the acting is pitch perfect. Everyone plays it straight and serious, which makes the lunacy on-screen that much more funny. Toss in a few cameos by well known B-movie horror icons like Kevin McCarthy, Dick Miller and James Karen and you know you're in for a good time.

Definately unusual, but extremely entertaining.",1310601600,12,1135,4.957894736842105
4511146,5,B00500IVF6,"High quality Larry Blamire and crew.  On the edge of your seat action, as long as you are sitting on a tiny chair.  Great stuff for his style of film or 50's style monster flicks.",1308096000,7,179,4.085714285714285

4511150,3,B00500IVF6,"First, let me say that this Region 2 DVD (UK and elsewhere, not the US) will play on your home computer; it played on mine.  Having said that, I cannot recommend this movie over The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra Returns, Again, or Dark and Stormy Night, all of which I have and my daughter and I love.  The Jeens scream in DaSN alone is worth the price of admission!
In this movie the lines and actors are acting too much like they mean for it to be a parody rather than LSoC where yes, its a parody, but it did not seem so ""forced"".  I've watched about half of the movie and there is a 50/50 chance I may not watch the rest of it.  I will give 2 thumbs up for the Title Song sung by The Manhattan Transfer.  I really like Larry Blamaire and Co. but this movie is just not doing it for me.  Don't let this review prevent you from seeing LSoC, LSoCRA, or DaSN, though, those are all classics.  If you have to, watch ToSF first so that you won't be disappointed, like I was, after seeing the other movies.",1436486400,,1028,4.11
4511151,5,B00500IVF6,"No effort of any kind is made to take the plot seriously.  The actors are flawless, which makes it work.  If you have a silly sense of humor, this is the film for you.  I have not found it in the American format but I can play it on my computer.  It is rarely on TV and you will be so glad you got it in your collections.

I suppose a plot summary might help.  A doctor is convinced that intelligence comes from the forehead and not from the brain.  When she poses this theory that laugh at her and tell her ""I want you to leave.  Before that, I want you to resign and then I want you to get out of here""  She must prove her theory in 24 hours.  She is aided by another doctor who finds himself with free time. His project was going nowhere.  He tried to find the connection between the lips and the brain but apprently there is none.  The things just move by themselves.

Meanwhile aliens in the shape of foreheads are on the attack!",1402704000,5,934,4.038251366120218
4511152,4,B00500IVF6,"The DVD did not play in the DVD player, so I tried it in the player in my computer and it worked there.  I will be looking for other works by this company.",1398988800,,155,3.696969696969697
4511153,2,B00500IVF6,"My family really enjoyed the Lost Skeleton movie and was looking forward to another corny movie from the same crew. However, the movie just was not engaging. Glad we didn't spend too much on it.",1387065600,,194,4.571428571428571
4511154,4,B00500IVF6,"Being a Larry Blamire fan, needless to say I was pumped to get this film. I was not disappointed, it turned out to be the same cornball style comedy that I expect from Larry and the crew. While not as good as the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra series, it still stands on it's own two feet.",1383782400,,283,4.071428571428571
4511155,5,B00500IVF6,"Larry Blamire has made a career out of making extremely silly parodies of late '50s/early '60s low-budget science fiction movies.  His first such movie, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, is a classic, and if anyone reading this hasn't seen that movie, please do yourself a favor and do so (and its sequel, The Lost Skeleton Returns Again).  Trail of the Screaming Forehead was his follow-up effort, and even though this is an extremely funny movie, distribution problems have prevented a region 1 DVD from being released even to this date, so in a sense this is the ""lost Larry Blamire movie"".  It's a darn shame, too, because all of the things that make his movies so funny are abundantly on display here.  This movie is an homage to the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" genre, where aliens come to earth and take over the bodies of unsuspecting humans.  The catch is that the aliens are forehead creatures; they ""used to be like us"" but then there was a nuclear war and they were somehow reduced to just their foreheads.  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because the movie makes a compelling case that the forehead, not the brain, is the seat of all human intelligence, and by injecting a forehead compound called Foreheadazine into the skull, one can become super-smart.  This is every bit as ridiculous as it sounds, and the cast hams it up with great glee.  All of Blamire's usual crew are here, plus some newcomers, and everyone does a great job.  I have to particularly single out Andrew Parks as the clueless scientist, and Brian Howe as an ""old salt"" kind of sailor.  Also, Larry Blamire's eccentric wordplay is all over this movie, and I have to fight to keep from typing in quotes because I don't want to spoil them for you.  Unlike Cadavra, this movie is not in black-and-white but in gloriously ultra-ultra-saturated color, reminiscent of when low-budget movies first started being produced in color and had to emphasize the color as much as possible, even when there was no reason to do so (check out the ridiculously colored chemicals in the lab, for instance).  The special effects are also completely over-the-top, particularly the forehead prosthetics.  And the ending is... beyond ridiculous.  Basically, if you like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, you can't go wrong with this film.",1367884800,4,2291,4.796437659033079
4511156,5,B00500IVF6,"I am a long-time fan of Larry Blamire, a writer, director, and actor who marshals an excellent cast to create wonderfully quirky, wildly hilarious movies. This particular version is Region 2 and is not currently available for Region 1 (I have no idea why) but I ordered it anyway in the hope that I could find a Region 2 player. To my delight, I found that it played just fine on my XBox 360.",1365897600,,392,4.3108108108108105

Think invasion of the body snatchers, except the body snatchers are now flesh-colored, bologna-bodied parasites that wobble around on the ground before seizing their unsuspecting hosts-to-be. Quite wacky, but done well, and honestly refreshing. I liked it.",1503619200,,316,6.044444444444444
