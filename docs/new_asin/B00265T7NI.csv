3851390,4,B00265T7NI,This was an excellent DVD.  For young children the initial scene may be considered slightly violent. The story is from a true life story and the acting was good.  It was not a high action DVD.,1268092800,3,192,4.305555555555555
3851391,5,B00265T7NI,Great story line about a lost parnet and how the other parent pick up the pieces and changes his lif for the better.,1265846400,,116,4.086956521739131
3851392,4,B00265T7NI,"I really enjoyed this movie - it's a modern tale of a marriage gone wrong and when the parents split up the father misses out on the joy of being an equal partner in the raising of his children.  A word of caution, the scene at the start of the movie where the mother is brutally shot would be very disturbing for young children.  I watched this with my ten year old niece and she was quite upset by it - particularly as the movie is based on a true story.  Lovely to see the relationship develop between the two young girls and their estranged Dad and the realisation on the part of the girls that you don't need to live in a big house and have fancy clothes and gadgets to be happy!!  Recommended.",1260230400,4,699,4.155555555555556
3851393,5,B00265T7NI,"Been looking for this movie for a while.  I'm so glad I can find these ""hard to find"" movies on Amazon.  The whole family saw this a couple times before I decided to look for it.  I should say it has to touch some place in the heart when two 20-something men/boys actually tell Mom to find it.  It's really nice that there are still movies out there with no gunfire, excessive swearing and show some family togetherness.  I liked how emotional distance is bridged as the two girls start to see their father through kinder eyes than through those of the bitter aunt and her family.  Sure, some of both girls acting is immature, but the meanings and feelings do translate.  I also love just about any movie that Mary McDonnell is in.  Give this movie a hearty hurrah!",1256774400,10,765,4.414285714285715

3851401,5,B00265T7NI,"Good story well done. Plus my best friend was the witness protection program person. AND even better -- DNA not available then solved the murder -- what movie couldn't show was everyone suspected the grandfather ( a hotshot lawyer who thought he could outsmart)
but no proof then w/o DNA. The grandfather (step) was SENTENCED last Feb -- is in prison now YES!  Old but finally caught. The father cowboy died of cancer. They should make a follow up movie.",1390435200,,454,4.675

3851416,5,B00265T7NI,This is a must see movie for everyone.  It's the story of a father fighting to raise his two girls and keep them grounded. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.,1378080000,,171,3.8857142857142857
3851417,5,B00265T7NI,"It is nice to see a plain old fashion movie that doesn't have a lot of violence throughout the movie or bad language.  Something a little more like everyday life.  Granted there was somewhat of a violent scene at the beginning to set the stage for the movie but then it was over.  We need more of these types and not so many of violence and sex and language, my goodness the language in some of these movies would make a sailor blush.  Hope to see more of these types of movies.",1373500800,,478,4.163043478260869
3851418,5,B00265T7NI,Great movie that shows real life struggles and triumphs of a seperated family. This was inspired by a real story which makes it even more speacial.,1363996800,,147,4.6923076923076925

3851421,4,B00265T7NI,"First, in the Family Feature version of this movie, all the spoken d*mn's, visual of Jessie falling after being shot, and the bar fight and arrest of Charlie were removed. I suppose this was to get the straight ""G"" rating. One thing they could not remove, though, was the underlying theme that Jessie and her two girls were living in the same house with Jessie's fiance while still unmarried. (This might be offensive to some.) Beyond that, the movie shows real emotional struggles between a macho cowboy who has no clue how to relate to his two daughters and those spoiled city girls who have just lost their mother and been moved to a world that they have never seen before. Charlie comes to realize what is important in life, though, and comes through with heroic commitment to and love for his daughters. The movie has some very moving scenes of father/daughter reconciliation.",1329264000,2,881,4.764705882352941
3851422,3,B00265T7NI,"Slow moving through the first 3/4 of the film.  Several times I almost shut the
movie off.
 The last part is well done, as the father and 2 daughters get close.
 Acting was good.",1275523200,,178,4.176470588235294
3851423,5,B00265T7NI,"I just purchased this DVD but have watched it several time.  Peter Strauss played the abscent father of two girls the youngest having seen the murder of her Mother. They have to give up a rich life style to live on a ranch where their father is just a Rodeo cowboy.  With the help of Mary McDonnel, a case worker from child services, he fights a wealthy Aunt and the ones who are investigating  their Mom's death to keep his girls but must first win the girls. It is a must see. Good clean movie for the family.",1271030400,3,511,4.1938775510204085
8352055,4,B00265T7NI,"I will admit that I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this movie. Grabbed it to get me through the Major Crimes hiatus and catching up on all of Mary McDonnell's movies. I have watched it several times and just think it is a really well done movie. The writing, acting (including the kids) and setting are fantastic. Just a great family film.",1462060800,,342,4.359375
