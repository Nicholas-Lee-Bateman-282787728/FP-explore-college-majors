6111800,5,B00GT1RHIC,"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this DVD.  Music, humor and history are woven throughout 82 minutes of quick cut film that focuses on the personal connection between individual players and the instrument, and the soulful sound produced by breathing through the harp.  It's a tale of dedication and of innovation, of historical greats like Little Walter and Howlin' Wolf and current players including Howard Levy and Jason Ricci who continue to advance the field.  It's a story of earned respect from artists who routinely turn a pocket ""toy"" into a showstopping display of musical virtuosity.

Told by musicians in their own words and through emotion charged performance clips, this story moves and grooves.  I'll watch again.",1388707200,5,730,5.100840336134453

8627237,5,B00GT1RHIC,"This is the best documentary about harmonica playing ever done. It's also the only one, so far as I know, putting in a class of one. Seriously, I loved this documentary. While pointing out that harmonica music today is everywhere, movie soundtracks, commercials, rock, pop, country western and folk music (even classic), it frequently, ""don't get no respect.""
I first noticed the instrument in the 1950s when Little Walter's ground-breaking harmonica tunes such as ""Juke,"" and ""My Babe,"" and ""Flying Saucer,"" shook up the blues field. Walter gets his share of attention in the doc as the innovator he was.
In fact, the doc does a nice job of briefly covering the history of the instrument and the players who took it from being considered almost a toy to the contemporary masters  of the instrument who can make a diatonic play chromatically using technique. You'll never know how difficult that is unless you get good enough to try it.
Some of the best contemporary harp players weigh in here on what the instrument means to them, how they got hooked on it, and why that gritty, rough sound is so pervasive. I had the good luck to hear a number of them live and all of them on CD.
The music is so good I sometimes pop it the player just to try some of the riffs.",1405382400,,1263,4.563876651982379
