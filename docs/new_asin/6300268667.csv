2334407,5,6300268667,Step back in time to an era of comedy and laughter almost forgotten. This hilarious ride through the life of one American president who just doesn't care that he doesn't care ! His strange family and a cast of characters that will make you double over with laughter .,1397606400,,267,4.469387755102041
2334408,4,6300268667,"Here is a nice goofy take on the presidency of the United States. Bob Newhart is president Link and Gilda Radner is his horny daughter with Madeline Kahn as his ditsy wife. His advisors are a motley crew of equally inept misfits. Links sole focus seems to be getting reelected and nothing else. Sounds frighteningly familiar, aka real life politicians. This movie views like an extended early Saturday Night Live skit. It has lots of amusing rediculosities.

RIP Gilda I miss you.",1397001600,,480,4.853658536585366
2334409,3,6300268667,"When I received this movie I was excited to have a date night with my girlfriend watching a movie that to us stood the test of time comedy wise, however after the 4th DVD player still unable to read this disc we were able to get it to work only with the computer.

The audio sync was a little off and the video itself left a little to be desired but in the end we both ended up laughing the night away with comedy that is sorely missed today.",1392508800,2,442,3.966292134831461
2334410,5,6300268667,"A great comedy. I have always liked Bob Newhart and the late Gilda Radner. A sort of ""Take this culture and system and some of it's modern core attitudes and carry them to their ultimate logical conclusions"" sort of film. One of my favorite skits ever came from this one which I won't spoil. I'll just say it's a back and forth discussion on how Manfred Link (Bob Newhart) became President. I'm sort of wierd and realize not everyone will like this as much as I did, especially anyone in the US Government.:))) I'm glad Warner Brothers is releasing some of these old but good quality films on DVD, Archive Collection series.",1386374400,,624,4.580357142857143
2334411,4,6300268667,"""First Family"" is a fitfully funny, not raucously so, political satire.  Strange that it doesn't have more bite because it's the brainchild of Buck Henry who created ""Get Smart"" with Mel Brooks and co-wrote the screen adaptation of ""The Graduate"" with Calder Willingham.  Equally strange was this film was released during the Carter Administration so they could have mined that for inspiration.  Best bits include the Ambassador of Gorm(Julius Harris) and his command of English phraseology, the First Daughter (Gilda Radner) taking part in a fertility ritual, and the President (Bob Newhart) relating a recurring ""soup"" dream to his interpreter(Austin Pendleton).  Solid work is offered by a veteran comic cast(Newhart, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, et. al.)  Radner, who along with Tina Fey was probably the greatest female talent to emerge from ""Saturday Night Live"", is genuinely wasted in a thankless role.  Truth be told Radner was never effectively used on the big screen even in the vehicles she co-starred in with her husband, Gene Wilder.  In a completely superfluous digression when are they going to release on disc a film Henry starred in directed by Milos Forman called ""Taking Off""?  It's a terrific film and it's only available on Region 2 Blu-Ray.",1377388800,2,1264,5.2227722772277225

2334413,5,6300268667,"I had forgotten this movie existed.  I was 8 when it came out.  I was sitting in my office this morning and all of the sudden scenes started popping into my head and laughed so hard that I was in tears.  I began searching this morning for a DVD of the movie, but can't find one anywhere.  I don't own a VCR, so ordering the VHS would do me no good.  I know that a lot of people found it offensive, but we thought it was hilarious and used to watch it over and over again.",1286755200,4,471,3.8645833333333335
2334414,4,6300268667,"ASIN First Family (1980)

Twenty years ago, before leaving for work, I would set the timer to record lunchtime movies.  Some were real finds, like First Family. Madeline Kahn's comedic set pieces as First Lady are hilarious. Bob Newhart is the badly behaved President. I can believe that it received poor reviews. In the way that throw away gags sail over the tops of peoples' heads. Sure, parts are unfunny, but for those with a willing suspension of disbelief, enjoy and get it put onto DVD!",1200009600,3,493,4.72093023255814

8069477,2,6300268667,"Slightly boring and blatantly racist, it still has comedy geniuses Gilda Radner, Madeline Kahn and Bob Newhart. Some of the humor from the usually great Buck Henry, seems as though it came from the equally great Mel Brooks' pen. But moments of greatness are few and far between, here.
Oh yeah, Gilda's character loses her virginity to a statue of a fertility god.",1469923200,,363,4.777777777777778
