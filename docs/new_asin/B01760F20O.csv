8738091,5,B01760F20O,"Fantastic video and audio of U.K. performing both albums in sequence. Additionally, they perform to of the non-studio tracks from Night After Night, as well as a song from the early touring years only heard on bootlegs.
I saw them during their last three reunion tours, and this video does a great job of capturing Wetton and Jobson in fine form.",1507680000,2,346,4.688524590163935
8738092,5,B01760F20O,Very good live historical representation of the band. I am enjoying owning it.,1472601600,,78,5.076923076923077
8738094,5,B01760F20O,"Okay, yeah. This price is outrageous... BUT... that notwithstanding, this is an incredible performance. Pro-shot and beautifully edited. The audio could have had a better mix. John's bass gets lost in the mix here and there and the drums are over-compressed when heard alone but overall it's pretty good. I've seen the ""Reunion"" and ""Eddie Jobson: Four Decades"" discs too and if you want the best of the lot, this is definitely the one to get.

Want it cheaper? I went to the Amazon Japan website and got it shipped to Tennessee USA for a total of $58 and it STILL arrived in three days! Still a little pricey but for the true fan, look at it this way: It's way less than the cost of a ticket to see the show... and it's a show that will never be repeated again. Well worth it in my opinion.

I won't go on about the performance too much, but it is effing fantastic! I've been a fan since the first album came out and their music has been a part of my life's soundtrack since then. I go through periods where I won't hear anything by UK for months and then one day I'll trip across a song and work the first two albums back into my ""radio"" playlist again. If you're a die-hard fan, you know what I mean.

The crowning song on this disc is (was) actually one of my least favorites: ""Caesar's Palace Blues"". Eddie Jobson plays like a possessed musical madman, a cloud of backlit resin powder flying from his bow with stage lights illuminating that fantastical acrylic violin and playing the song to perfection. It's enough to give you chill-bumps!

One other thing that impressed me: I'm not a big fan of live shows on video in general. There's always some stupid drunk redneck that has to ""wooooo!!"" during a particularly emotional (and usually quiet) segment of a song. The Japanese audience on this show was totally engrossed in the performance and were very polite to wait until the stage was silent to applaud. There were times when John encouraged them to participate and they did, but overall it was quite a breath of fresh air compared to American audiences. I do the same when I go to concert. I paid good money to hear the band and I want to hear them and appreciate their talent. I didn't pay to hear you sing or yell, or watch the show on your cell phone screen. WATCH AND LISTEN TO THE SHOW!! <rant off>

Do yourself a favor: If you're a true fan, drop $60 on this. You will not regret it.",1464134400,4,2400,4.384269662921349
