2806830,2,B000P0I4O4,"I realize I must suspend disbelief some when I watch a movie but this movie was just too unbelievable even for a movie.  People in serious car wrecks and escape without a scratch, 3 men in a helicopter crash that destroyed the helicopter and they all walk away.  A guy doing precision shooting out of a bouncing helicopter. I couldn't even finish.  Goes to show that two great stars can make a lemon movie.",1185580800,7,406,4.45945945945946
2806831,5,B000P0I4O4,"I Strongly Disagree with a Couple of the Reviews On This Page! I think some people are so used to huge commercially driven blockbusters with roman numerals at the end of the title that they don't know a good action film when they see it! This Film is a HIDDEN GEM and one of those Rare Action Films that actually has EXCELLENT ACTING In The Film! This is The Type of Film that Keeps you Guessing till the very end and Morgan Freeman actually does The Impossible, he plays a bad guy that you actually grow to like. Definatley see This Film, you cant go wrong with Freeman and Cusack!",1185494400,5,582,4.3
2806832,5,B000P0I4O4,"Morgan Freeman and John Cusack team up to bring in an action thriller that really deserves a little more attention.
  Great Direction. Terrific Special Effects.
  Fast-paced storyline with minimal ""to the point"" dialogue that keeps the viewer informed and involved.
  Add a superb supporting cast with good editing and you have a full flavor film that delivers a cute finale with a bit of a twist.
  Don't miss it.",1185408000,7,414,4.898550724637682
2806833,4,B000P0I4O4,"I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman anyway, and his typically first-class performance was in evidence in The Contract. This movie hits on all four cylinders: Great acting, great script, good directing and beautiful scenery. There were some sub-plots that deserved more direction and development and I saw a couple minor plot holes but that aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

Another plus is that it wasn't as horrifically graphic as many of this genre typically are. Yeah, people get shot and things explode, but it's not too awful (compared to typical hollywood horror).

Bad-guy Morgan Freeman explains to an inquiring teen what he does for a living. He explains that he's a professional assassin and ""removes obstacles"" to help advance governmentally-ordered progress. When asked further about his moral code, Morgan Freeman responded, ""There are things I wouldn't do. I have my limits. I just haven't found them yet.""

I don't have the time to watch a lot of movies so I'm pretty discerning about how I kill two hours of time, but The Contract was a worthy flick. I may even watch it a second time.",1184803200,3,1103,4.887700534759358

2806835,5,B000P0I4O4,"A well done, low-key medium octane thriller, The Contract works on quite a few levels offering up plentiful helpings of drama, thrills, action, and intrigue.  The story revolves around a father and son learning to reconnect and trust one another under tense circumstances after becoming inadvertantly entangled in a dangerous criminal plot.  Though there are certainly some scenes of violence, the film isn't buried in heavy amounts of gore or extreme violence and was the perfect Friday night thriller for us all including our 18 year old nephew.  Fun, exciting movie; Morgan & Cusack are always in top form.",1184025600,31,609,5.1313131313131315
2806836,3,B000P0I4O4,"Enjoyable if not derivitive thriller with perfunctory performances by leads Morgan Freemand and John Cusack.  The storyline is thin, the characters are thin, but the film is beautifully shot, had some wonderful set pieces (the cliff scene) and some moments of nice suspense and action.  A few of the action sequences are extremely well executed and surpisingly quite thrilling.  On the downside, the movie definitely plays it too safe, there's certainly nothings screaming ""extraordinary"" in any sense, and is lacking verisimilitude.  Still, it's a pleasant and very scenic journey, has some memorable moments, and John Cusack and Morgan Freeman even when only mediocre are still always fun to watch on screen.",1180483200,25,710,5.36936936936937

2806845,5,B000P0I4O4,"The Contract is a cat and mouse game with John Cusack's character, Ray Keene as the mouse and Morgan Freeman's character, Frank Camden as the cat.  This is one the few Freeman movies I can remember where he was a truly ""bad"" bad guy.  In Shawshank Redemption, Freeman was a ""good"" bad guy.  Yes, he was imprisoned and he deserved it.  Here he's an assassin who wants Keene gone because Keene wants Camden brought to justice.

I really felt these were believable characters.  I enjoyed the movie and got lost in it.  Watching movies at home I am too often afforded an opportunity to ""multitask"".  You know, play solitaire on the phone, search Amazon's Lightning Deals, etc.  While watching this, I was locked in.  The only thing I did was get up for a glass of water and that was only after pausing the movie.

Freeman is a great actor.  Cusask is a great actor.  This was a very good vehicle to allow them each to shine.",1468713600,,920,4.437125748502994

2806882,3,B000P0I4O4,"This film had a great cast.  But a great cast can't make up for the fact that, half the time, I didn't know what was going on or whom to root for.  Seriously, who were the good guys and the bad guys here?  What was the conspiracy all about?  What did the President of the United States have to do with it?  I'm so confused.  Sure, I liked seeing Morgan Freeman and John Qusack interacting as both men gave strong performances, but they clearly knew what I didn't...what this film was all about!  I'm so confused I can't figure out anything else to say about this film.  It had a great cast, but what was it about?!  I know there was a hit man, played by Freeman, who was apparently pretty good at his job, but there's not much more.  Sure, John Qusack played a single father who had trouble connecting with his son, but what does that have to do with anything?  Watch this film and maybe you'll figure it out.  Thankfully, I didn't lose any sleep trying to figure this thing out as it was all so confusing that I lost interest.  Enjoy...if you can.",1404086400,,1048,4.258883248730965
2806883,1,B000P0I4O4,"This movie has too many ridiculous impossible and improbable inconsistencies and total lack of realistic cohesion, to be bearable. The acting is subpar, and the plot is a ridiculous waste of time. After about 45 minutes of trying to give it a chance, I could no longer take it. This is one of those ""D"" or ""F"" movies that come on at 2:30 in the morning when you're lying on the couch half asleep, and/or half drunk.

2806887,4,B000P0I4O4,"While many might find this to be a bit of a ""yawner"", the intricacies in the details throughout the movie make the movie interesting.  In a day where high-impact action and massive use of CGI seems to be the selling point for a movie, ""The Contract"" uses intrigue to keep the viewer interested.

Because of this I almost wrote off this movie. However, I'm glad I ignored those reviews. I actually REALLY liked this movie. In the past I have chosen to watch several action-thriller movies where they seem to cookie cutter design their action sequences, but who cares if its good cookies. Why skip or complain about a movie that does it. The action was full boar and the acting was solid with big name stars. Take a chance, as I often do, and you may find a lot of GREAT SLEEPERS waiting to entertain you! I am sure you will love the story and the actions, thrills with a couple of simple twists, and you are bound to like some of the GOOD-BAD GUYS.

Ray Keene (John Cusack) is going camping with his son (Jamie Anderson) for a much needed bonding trip. Playing the good Samaritan, Ray gets caught in the middle of the events, finding himself on the run with a handcuffed Morgan being followed by heavily armed bad guys who are being tracked by the good guys...but the bad guys have never seen a John Cusack film and don't know what a school teacher, wanting to bond with his son, is capable of doing.

The acting was good, even if the plot was weak. The film has a twist, but nothing to write home about. Might work for an action flick rental. Not on my keeper shelf.

2806909,4,B000P0I4O4,"I decided this one was worth a try; I'll admit I had not read any reviews and had only seen a brief synopsis of the story line. We watched it for the first time last night and we both found it entertaining overall. As with most movies one must be prepared to accept certain givens and if one is able to do that the movie may work for the viewer. If, on the other hand, one is not able to do that then the movie has little chance of success. Both my wife and I were able to accept the givens so we both enjoyed the movie.

I mentioned certain qualifications in the title and must admit we did have some minor problems with certain parts of the script which seemed entirely too improbable to accept as we watched the story unfold. The story focuses on a man and his son who has decided a camping trip might be a way to re-establish a somewhat damaged relationship. When the totally unexpected happens and they are thrust into a life or death situation their priorities must turn from relationships to survival.

The scenery is dramatic and lovely and the acting is top notch. Morgan Freeman and John Cusack turn in effective performances as does newcomer, Jamie Anderson as the son. All told the movie provides an interesting evening's entertainment. I recommend it.",1337040000,2,1264,4.467532467532467

Was quite original as well and never got bored watching it, kept my attention well from start to end, nice story to it as well.  I am not a big Morgan Freeman fan but liked his role here very much.

2806914,1,B000P0I4O4,"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and I can't recall another movie of his that I didn't like. This movie reminds me of a 3:10 to Yuma set in the woods... with horrible directing and/or acting.

My main beef is with how Cusack's character treats Freeman. Let say you have a dangerous felon on your hands, you are armed, and your kid is with you, how many times are you going to get less than an arms length away on your own accord? If you can ignore Cusack's character being unintentionally stupid I think this could be worth a little entertainment value. Freeman is fine, but like I said, my attention was drawn to the blatant disregard for common sense.

2806915,5,B000P0I4O4,"There's nothing flashy or showy in 'The Contract' - and there doesn't need to be. It's beautifully shot, as well-acted as it needs to be, and hits on all the right notes. Simply put, this is a movie that gets it right, without making a lot of unnecessary noise.

Part of that formula is in the cast. When you have two actors like Morgan Freeman and John Cusack - both almost instantly likeable in any role - as characters on opposite sides, you immediately set up a situation where it's hard to know who the ""hero"" of the movie is. 'The Contract' is not a standout role for either actor, but they treat the story with respect and give it the right tone. With these two actors, surrounded by a good supporting cast (including Alice Krige and Jonathan Hyde), you never really know whose side is the ""right"" side. This dynamic creates a complexity and an unpredictability that is refreshing in a suspense film, a dynamic carried through in the story.

The plot advances steadily from multiple perspectives, paced well and with plenty of surprise in store. Former police officer (now teacher) John Cusack crosses paths with hitman Morgan Freeman in the middle of trying to fulfill a contract, with Freeman's team of assassins following close behind. Familiarity of the territory and the element of surprise are played against ruthlessness and expertise. Layers of deception unfold and change the story's direction, moving steadily towards an ending that remains uncertain until the final minutes.

The cinematography is handsome without being distracting, capturing unique angles but always with a focus on advancing the story. The action scenes come together particularly well, not relying on fast edits and extreme close-ups of blurry motion to create tension - the tension is there in the story already, the angle and the editing simply serve that well, understated and elegant.

'The Contract' is unpredictable and engaging, entertaining and thoughtful. All the elements for a good movie are here, and they're brought together skillfully and well. It may not have that blockbuster quality, lots of special effects, or an Oscar-caliber performance from either of its two headline actors. It doesn't need any of those things.

All I know is that it kept me guessing, kept me entertained, and I enjoyed it from the first minute to the last.",1306368000,2,2337,4.966751918158568
2806916,2,B000P0I4O4,"In this clich-riddled drama/thriller, John Cusack and Morgan Freeman turn in tired performances for a quick cash payout.  Either filming was directly after daily morning marathons, there were epic late night whiskey drinking contests, or both had substantial mob loans with escalating vigs.  To say they were less than vehement would be like saying the Bataan Death March was less than energetic.  Don't get me wrong.  Both are great actors and did fairly well compared to others.  Hence, the issue.  The remaining cast literally gave me an ulcer, and a child actor made me seriously consider a vasectomy.

The plot, if you can call it that, is a tale as derivative as the 6th Police Academy movie.  But maybe not as good.  Ray (Cusack) is a gym teacher who has experienced problems lately.  Father-son drama after Mom died (or left because of the kid's acting), son gets into a little Mary Jane, camping ensues.  Because, like, the kid was an aspiring Eagle Scout or something and this will totally get them to overcome their transparently poor attempt to look at odds with one another.  Don't worry, it's hardly explained in the movie either.  Things go awry when filming starts...I mean, when they run into Frank (Freeman), an assassin with government/CIA ties, and his team of incompetent mercenaries who possess slightly more training than the local donut munching police in the non-distinct woodsy Washington town.  Ray is positioned as a pawn who must deliver Frank to the law.  Along the journey plot incontinence occurs.

Character development is atrocious.  Aside from the aforementioned, the details are minimal.  We learn nothing of Frank's past, his motives, or his training.  It's all thinly veiled masturbatory excerpts from dog-eared Soldier of Fortune magazines.  His mid-movie acquisition of a conscious is even more poorly contrived.  Oh, did I mention that the only reason a trained merc. isn't gutting Ray's kid, decorating the forest with his entrails, and happily escaping is that Ray used to be a cop?  Because totally explains how he is able to not only control Frank but also survive the Three Stooges routine from the others.  Speaking of plot problems.  Off the top of my head, the helicopter scene was ridiculous, the midway addition to the cast is unexplainable fodder, and the twists involving federal agents were so underdeveloped they should have been deleted scenes.  The most egregious gaffe, however, is the murderer who stops mid-hunt, while just behind the guy he plans to kill, while hoping to save his boss who has all monetary access, while in a dense, cell coverage eliminating forest, to play chess online.  Read that again.

Add in an ending that had all the deliberation of a duck-walk to the bathroom after a 3-day Taco Bell bender and you have a movie that not only deserved to go straight to the DVD bin despite its two stars, but maybe didn't deserve that much.  Checkmate.",1305158400,2,2922,4.95679012345679

The story of a ex-military-trained paid assassin (Morgan Freeman), leading a team on a high-level 'hit' under orders from 'the Executive Branch' (represented by senior agent Alice Krige), winding up in the middle of the wilderness as the accidental prisoner of an ex-cop/gym teacher (John Cusack) and his son (Jamie Anderson), with good AND bad guys after them, is enjoyable, but simply doesn't hold up to close scrutiny.

With the star power involved, a gifted young performer (Anderson), making his acting debut, a crew of brilliant award-winning technicians, and fabulous locations (primarily in Bulgaria's lush wilderness), you would expect something really special. But the script, originally written by the late Stephen Katz, then updated and polished by first-time scribe, John Darrouzet, borrows heavily from many sources (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-River-Wild/dp/0783222149/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The River Wild</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shoot-to-Kill/dp/B00008L3UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shoot to Kill</a>, BOTH versions of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma/dp/B000XR9L50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma</a>, and more), and simply never creates any real tension. The film seems more a series of strung-together moments, than a decisive 'whole'. Many are entertaining (Cusack's lack of enthusiasm about camping, Freeman's remark about the kind of school Cusack would teach at), some are moving (Anderson attempting to explain the rift with his father), some ridiculous (Why would you climb down a mountain in a rainstorm? And how do two killers and Cusack ALL arrive at the exact same location, at the same instance?), some gratuitous (poor Megan Dodd, the closest thing to a 'romantic interest' in the film, does a totally unnecessary nude scene when she first appears).

Apparently, financing was a major problem during production (the list of producers in the opening credits is huge), and Beresford invested his own money to finish the film; it then went directly to DVD (I found no box office totals listed for the film). All of which explains why this 2006 release received so little fanfare.

If you are a fan of Beresford, Freeman and/or Cusack, I think you'll still enjoy this film (there is a very entertaining 'Making Of' documentary in the Special Features, with their observations), and I admit, I've seen MUCH worse than ""The Contract"". Sadly, I've seen much better, as well...",1288742400,,3386,7.332512315270936

2806921,3,B000P0I4O4,"The Contract: 5 out of 10: Let me start by quoting Variety's review which easy sums up my feelings about this film better than I ever could. 'Scripters Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet don't inspire great expectations with their contrived setup, so it can't be said that what follows -- pretty much your standard-issue, pursuit-through-the-wilderness melodrama -- is, in the strictest sense of the term, disappointing. But it's more than fair to complain about the plodding predictability of a by-the-numbers scenario that, 30 years ago, might have served as the blueprint for a routine TV movie. (Think Darren McGavin in Freeman's role, then sub in Doug McClure for Cusack.)'

There it is concisely; a predictable by the numbers thriller that went straight to DVD despite starring Morgan Freeman and John Cusack.

This is a remarkably average film. Morgan Freeman plays an old sardonic assassin. A bad guy with depth, education and possibly (could it be) a heart. In other words the usual Morgan Freeman role. Like Alan Arkin, Freeman has comfortable found a persona that gathers a steady paycheck. To Freeman's credit, at least he is fun to watch and has fun with the role.

That certainly cannot be said of John Cusack's overly serious, charisma free turn as the recently widowed, and ex-cop single father. Cusack acts as if he is spending the entire movie working on a particularly troublesome bowl movement. Considering the lightweight proceedings around him, and co-star Freeman's paycheck turn; this method acting madness seems out of place.

The plot summarized is Freeman get captured, escapes while in handcuffs, gets recaptured by Cusack on a father son bonding hike, then they all find themselves on the run with Freeman's fellow assassins and the FBI in pursuit.

One strange development is the attempt to give widowed Cusack a love interest in the middle of the forest. Cusack and son run into a hot blonde, Calista Flockheart lookalike skinny dipping (attractive Megan Dodds) and her fianc. Cusack somehow convinces them that he is an okay guy; even though he is in the woods with a gun pointed at a handcuffed, elderly black man.

The fianc is a funny character. A San Francisco lawyer, who hate the wilderness, has an effeminate manner and wears (you cannot make this up) an ascot. What? Is the Mystery Machine parked nearby? Needless to say, he gets killed by a sniper to make room for Cusack. His fiances reaction to his bloody death? 'meh'.

Which nicely sums up my reaction to this movie.",1258588800,,2508,4.957142857142857

It could've been a good movie. It SHOULD have been a good movie.  Unfortunately, it is poorly done.  There isn't enough plot to justify the length of the movie and something about it makes it seem very outdated - like you're watching a movie made ten or fifteen years ago.  It could've been improved with more exploration of the characters' situations, but that doesn't happen, either.  And the idea of the government agent giving instructions for Morgan's character to be killed, while surrounded by cops - yet nobody overhears her - would be laughable if it weren't so stupid.

John Cusak as the middling dad forced into a bad situation has to overcome some implausibly bad odds at times as he outwits Freeman's cohorts and another assassin intent on killing Freeman (it will come as no surprise as to who hired this cheeseball). There are plenty of moments where the characters get to know each other that Freeman plays beautifully. The actor playing Cusak's son offers no chops whatsoever as a teen troubled with the usual vice of pot smoking and he delivers lines more mechanically than the robot on Lost in Space. He is a complete waste as is much of the writing for his character. The backdrop of the film, the wonderful wooded vistas provide visual fodder and were clearly the director's main interest.

Then again their names were the only reason I picked this up, so maybe the studio's ploy worked, and it's actually their performances that saved it from being unwatchable.

Cusack is having father/son issues with the teen after his wife passes away from cancer. In an attempt to devote some ""quality time"" and bond with his son they go on a camping trip in the Washington state wilderness. Unfortunately for them, rogue CIA spook Freeman happens to be en route to prosecution in that area when his mercenary buddies try to free him. The escape scenario doesn't go as smoothly as planned and Freeman ends up in the unwanted ""custody"" of Cusack (who just happens to be an ex-cop turned teacher) with the help of an errant handgun. In the middle of the nowhere they look to evade the trailing mercenaries and get to safety.

There are way too many implausiblities and cliches in the story to make this a good film (e.g., why wouldn't Cusack just take Freeman's advice and the gun, leave and not put his son in harm's way?). The meeting of the other hiking couple was totally unnecessary and felt tacked on just to try to add some drama at the last scene. The action was OK, but rote and implausible again.

I don't claim this would be the best movie you've ever seen (hence the 4 stars here, rather than 5, and for some perhaps even those 4 stars are being generous), but I don't think it's that bad either.

Premise is simple enough with John Cusack's character trying to connect with his son and taking him out for a camping trip that just happens to have both of them crossing paths with an 'exterminator' (of humans) in the form of Morgan Freeman's character.

Much of the film was made in the Pacific Northwest and it helps to provide some awe inspiring scenery in the background.  Some viewers would complain though that where that scenery is there should be more action or more dialogue.  Personally I'm happy to watch the scenery and let the movie unfold.  No, it's not that quickly paced, and yes, some things are telegraphed from what seems to be miles away (making things a bit too predictable), but the story was enjoyable enough to make me want to see it again.

I must admit, my purchase of the movie was somewhat inspired by Morgan Freeman being in the movie.  Though there are plenty of movies and roles he's been in that I wouldn't go out of my way to see, his role here seemed to fit him nicely and I think he did well with the part he was asked to play.  (There are movies he's been in that you couldn't pay me money to watch again, such as Driving Miss Daisy, yick!, and others that I just never cared to see...)

2806942,2,B000P0I4O4,"As we watched this movie, we kept asking ourselves outloud... what the heck are Morgan Freeman and John Cusack doing in this film?  This movie's writing smells of a bad 1980s made-for-tv thriller.  I can't imagine how two of the best actors in Hollywood could have paired up in a movie that I found so disapointing.  In most cases, these guys would carry even the weakest of movies and, to a small degree they do here, but it's just too poorly written and produced to recover.  The rest of the casting also seems way off - maybe they're good actors but they have all been caught in a pretty awful movie.  Forget for a moment the bad writing and awkward dialouge, the post-production was the worst I've seen in a major movie in a long time.  There is one scene where a helicopter crashes and I could swear I was watching an episode of Dukes of Hazzard or something - cheesey slow-mo crash!  Oh well.",1203811200,,898,4.406060606060606

2806945,2,B000P0I4O4,"Despite the two terrific actors involved, Morgan Freeman and John Cusack, and Director, twice Oscar-nominated Bruce Beresford, ""The Contract"" misses every opportunity to be a great thriller or a moving drama because of its poorly-written script and boring action sequences. This is a kind of B action film in which a sniper tries to kill his target, but the target is saved by a pure luck more than once; in which the film's situation is incredibly contrived, but its weak story offers little except clich&eacute;d and uninteresting characters walking and talking.

Morgan Freeman is Frank, military-trained assassin in the custody of US marshals. He manages to escape with a help from contract killers, but is then apprehended by Ray, an ex-policeman played by John Cusack. Ray and Ray's son wander in the woods with Frank in handcuffs, trying to contact the police and turn in the hitman while protecting his son, but criminals are hot on the trail of them.

The story revolves around the three characters, but it gives no chance to show what these actors can do as it shows little character development. Actions (including shootings, a helicopter and a little bit of car crash) are too bland to interest us. The characters both the good and the bad behave illogically, always doing the last thing they should do and there are plenty of plot holes that would make you feel: ""Why do they have to do this?"" or ""Why don't they just do that?""",1199750400,2,1440,4.825910931174089
2806946,2,B000P0I4O4,"I see John Cusack and Morgan Freeman's face on the cover of a DVD box, I buy it.  Not that these guys have never made a bad movie, but they've certainly never made a movie worse.  The same is true here, although the movie was already pretty bad to begin with.

Gym teacher Ray Keene (Cusack at his most vacant) has a pubescent son who is grappling with several dull plot contrivances (the Dead Mom and Infrequent Pot Smoking).  In an attempt to bond with him before he goes too far down the wrong path, Ray takes his boy hiking.  Turns out they BOTH end up down the wrong path, in the middle of which is escaped-assassin, Frank (Freeman, who gives new meaning to the phrase ""phoning it in"").  Frank is pursued by his team of assisstants (assassisstants?), who want badly to be paid, but not far behind are also a group of snobbish U.S. Marshalls who have their own agendas.  It's Ray's job to avoid these two deadly (?) forces and bring Frank to justice.

No, wait.  Ray's job is a gym coach, making the next several hours of his life a pretty amazing feat, as he scales bluffs, outwits and outmanuevers a whole cadre of military-trained mercenaries and political heavies that appear to have no skills beyond complaining about coffee and smirking smugly at the incompetent local lawmen.  And, to be fair, the local lawmen are remarkably incompetent.

Who wrote this thing?  Furthermore, how did they get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driving-Miss-Daisy/dp/B000087F7D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driving Miss Daisy</a>'s Bruce Beresford to direct?  That must be, at least, how they got Freeman to lend his Oscar-winning weight to the title.  And that would explain Cusack (because who WOULDN'T want to star next to the incomparable Freeman?).  But none of it explains the script's tired dialogue (""You said mom would be okay!"" Ray's son, Chris, keens.  ""But she wasn't okay!  She wasn't okay!"").  None of it explains the crumpled story-line or the ludicrously two-dimensional characters (Alice Krige's skullish Gwen Miles is so flat she seems concaved).  And the plot holes!  Let's just say that they eventually become an acquired taste.  By the time you get to the scene I call the ""Helicopter Crash Conversation,"" you'll be shaking your head AND laughing.

The really funny thing, though, is that it's obvious SOMEONE put a lot of work into the film.  Certain scenes (the hit-and-run at the start, the accident that leads to Frank's initial capture) are smartly done.  And in the hands of an abler scribe (it was penned by the late Stephen Katz, who did mostly teleplays for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-A-Team/dp/B00005JN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The A-Team</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hardcastle-and-McCormick/dp/B000EGGBEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hardcastle and McCormick</a>) it might have pulled together into something you could take a passing interest in.

Ray thinks he must play hero and bring Cardin back into custody. Along the way he brings more harmless hikers into trouble and eventually actually loses Cardin despite all heroic efforts.

Kusack only makes an okay transition from regular guy to hero. Harrison Ford or Michael Douglas are way better at that. So he was a former cop, which explains that he outsmarts and outshoots a red-hot assassin. Nevertheless, the way he gets more and more fixated on turning in Cardin at the cost of risking his boy's life must seem unnatural to any parent. Morgan of course turns in one of his usual superb performances. He is actually likeable even as a pretty bad guy, showing his human side when saving the boy from falling down a rain-soaked mountain wall. A certain bonding is becoming evident between him and the teacher and boy, which in the end may very well save the lives of those two. Why Cardin is just cooperating with Ray all the time is not believable to me. If he had just sat down in the very beginning, what would Ray have done? Shot him? If the story had offered just one good reason for why Cardin was moving along in this odd trio, it would have made the whole movie more believable to me.",1193270400,2,1532,4.491039426523297

But the explanation for this anomaly is that this 2007 film comes from Millennium Films, which is the theatrical wing of Nu Image and the fact of the matter is that I only checked out ""The Contract"" because it had both Freeman and Cusak (although I will admit that having either one of them would normally be a good enough reason to check out a film).  But despite their presence and something of little twist regarding the plot in the end game, this movie never really commands our attention as it keeps itself to doing things by the numbers and never offering the sort of memorable moment or thrilling sequence you would like to see in such a movie.  At least Freeman and Cusak got to spend several weeks in Bulgaria making this film.

Freeman is Frank Cordell, who is not merely a professional assassin: he and his team kill their targets by making them look like accidents.  This could be pretty cool, but the script by Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet keeps things fairly simple for the two examples we get to see of Cordell and his team doing their jobs.  However, keeping things simple does not pay off this time as Cordell is captured and his team comes up with a plan to get him back.  Meanwhile, out in the forest is Ray Keene, played by Kusak, a man who has lost his wife to cancer and has taken his son, Chris (Jamie Anderson), camping.  They are not getting along and Ray is hoping some time together will help them bound, but apparently he has no other ideas on how to reconnect with the boy.  The next thing Ray knows he and Chris meet up with not only Cordell, but also a dying FBI agent who gives Ray his gun and tells him to get his prisoner to the authorities.  Obviously, this is going to be a most unusual camping trip.

Fortunately, Ray used to be a cop, although when he announces the fact it is news to us.  Cordell tries to reason with Ray, explaining that his guys are coming and Ray does not stand a chance.  Of course the good guys are coming too, but there are more plot complications to come because Cordell has another job to do and being captured greatly impairs his ability to do his job.  The supporting cast is pretty good, but except for Freeman, none of them are given anything interesting to say, let alone do.  Alice Krige plays one of the suits in Washington, D.C., with a vested interst in what is going on, and Megan Dodds, looking considerably more like a human being than she did as the wicked step sister in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ever-After/dp/B00006ZXSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ever After</a>,"" plays Sandra, a woman they meet in the woods who gets caught up in the misadventure.  Bill Smitrovich plays the local cop, who alternates between being a shade too smart or a step too slow in dealing with the developing situation.

Yet despite the cast, ""The Contract"" is a wash as a film.  If Freeman was not in it, I might have fallen asleep while watching it, because even if he was not being given anything really interesting to say he is of the class of actors that make the recitation of the phone book compelling.  I can even make the argument that the title gives away what should have been the twists and turns in the final act that changed everything and made this film more interesting.  Maybe having a first class musical score would have punched up things some more, but ""The Contact"" does not have that either.  Ultimately, a film begins with the words on the script, and beyond the basic plot that somehow got this cast to sign up, there is simply nothing there to help the director and cast get this thriller to a level where it would be worth watching twice, let alone once.",1188950400,,4321,4.906593406593407

  Ray overwhelms the killer and is planning to bring him to justice. This is where things go awry as there were so many instances where I saw opportunities for the killer to escape, take advantage of the situation or turn the tables - all straining viewer credibility.

A key point, for example, is his desire to be found by his buddies versus Cusack's demand that he go with them. Freeman could have simply refused to budge and lain on the ground. What could Cusack do? Yet Freeman goes with them - because Cusack's waving a gun in his face? Come on! But he does have a couple of good lines. (Watch for one of them delivered to a female hiker.)

His buddies don't fare much better for trained killers. One of them is dispatched in a truly amateurish fashion. The action is nothing to write home about.

Some nice scenery and cinematography too.  I just expected more.",1185753600,2,693,5.207207207207207
2806984,1,B000P0I4O4,"I rented this film expecting an easy to watch action film (my expectations were fairly low in terms of an intelligent script or suspense) but unfortunately I was so bored, I had to watch the film in installments.

Characters in the film are shallow and the introduction to them leaves you not caring one way or the other about them or what happens to them - a serious flaw in a thriller.  After all - how can there be suspense if you really don't care if any of the characters live or die?

The film finished and left myself and my girlfriend stunned as we were waiting for the big finale that explained what the hell the point of it all was.

No suspense, no sub plot, no real action and a terrible script (keep an eye out for the line delivered by one of the hitmen, ""I don't know ... I just don't know"" - its straight from a school play)

Its a terrible film and I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances, you'd get more suspense & consistency just flicking the channel on the remote control every minute.",1185753600,,1014,4.315789473684211
2806985,1,B000P0I4O4,"This film is boring predictable and unrealistic.
The script was dreadful as was some of the acting from the minor roles.
Cussack and Freeman fail to pull this weak story off i bet you they wished they had never done it in the first place.
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN BUYING OR RENTING THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED.
It really was one of the worst films i have ever watched.",1185667200,2,376,4.309859154929577

8187937,3,B000P0I4O4,"Bottom line:  Will you buy a story about an ex-cop (John Cusack), now teacher, and teen son who run into a handcuffed hit man (Morgan Freeman) in the woods while hiking in Oregon and then feel obligated to turn him into the authorities, with the hit man's cohorts hot on their trail?  If so, this is fine to pass the time.  But, in certain scenes, your dog may blurt out, ""Are you kidding me with this?"" ;) because this is the kind of probably too implausible movie that, I feel, will prevent the Academy Awards from ever seriously thinking about nominating Cusack for an Oscar (like his sister, Joan Cusack, for ""In and Out"").  For example, the movie is rolling right along when suddenly our lovable trio of Dad, son, and hit man are scaling dangerous cliffs, in the pouring rain, which reminded me of a scene in 2007's ""Pathfinder"" (which has a similar cliff-scaling scene, but oh yeah, in that movie it's done by a Viking who was raised by Indians) and another scene where Cusack takes out a man more than twice his size without a gun.  The plot is also more complex than it needs to be, and the lighting in some scenes is too dark to follow what's happening.  By now, Cusack has more than enough film credits to graduate to the next/higher echelon of cinema, something to look forward to.",1493078400,,1292,4.476595744680851
