8067468,5,B0009VM06C,"Mr. Awan is a great teacher! I've learned a great deal through this video program. He has delivered a detailed lecture, not missing anything that you may encounter using this Induction. I highly recommend it to all students of hypnosis. Brian A.",1208476800,,245,4.857142857142857
8067469,5,B0009VM06C,"I recently graduated from a school of Hypnosis; came out basically with one Induction i.e., the P.R. Induction! I thought of adding another Induction to my, ""Tool Box"" (as Mr. Awan puts it) so after searching many sites, I bought this DVD from Acme Hypnosis Center's own site. It was 2 1/2 hrs. long program but I don't think it could have been shorter than that because there were a lot of aspects to be covered and Mr. Awan did that very nicely. His language is easy to follow and you don't miss anything. I've read Dave Elman's book, ""Hypnotherapy"" but there were things I couldn't really understand ( being a novice, ofcourse!) This program explains them in detail. I never wrote to Mr. Awan to thank him for his honest teaching ethics but I think this review should do. Daniel Anderson NY",1150156800,7,793,4.5524475524475525
8067470,4,B0009VM06C,"I bought this program in 2004 when it was only on VHS. Keeping in view that it's an educational video, one must not expect Hollywood quality. Malik has done justice to the topic. Yeh, his pace is slow. Overall, it's an honest, informative program. Malik has discussed every aspect of the Induction quite elaborately. I could have given it 5 stars, but I took one away for it's pace and Audio Video quality. I learned from it.",1146614400,5,425,4.532467532467533
8067471,2,B0009VM06C,"I am just getting involved in hypnosis and bought this DVD hoping that I could get an organized, thoughtful presentation of the subject.  Unfortunately, this DVD was not it.  The subject matter was presented in a disjointed fashion, was very incomplete, and essentially this was a very amateurish, poorly produced DVD.  Mr. Awan was so boring I feel asleep several times during this overly long presentation.",1144713600,5,408,5.151515151515151
