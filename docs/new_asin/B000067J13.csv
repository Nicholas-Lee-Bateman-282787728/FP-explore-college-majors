Not to mention the fact that they picked the perfect venue, for I've never found a more intensive place to grow and learn than at a summer camp for the entire summer.

1717433,2,B000067J13,"""Happy Campers"" examines a group of summer campers at Camp Bleeding Dove, somewhere near the Carolinas.
The focus of the film is found in the relationships between seven camp counselors. Wichita (played by Brad Renfro) wants to get through the summer by being practical and honest with the campers and without entanglements from the other counselors. Wendy (Dominique Swain) wants a more romantic and ideal environment, which includes having an enduring relationship with Brad.  The other counselors eye each other, with a couple looking extra hard at Brad.
The kids have their traditional issues:  homesickness, bee-stings, epileptic fits, crushes, ogling, lampooning the other sex, reading porn magazines, and the like.
I suppose the ""R"" rating comes from a few mild sex scenes, displays of condoms, and a bit of quasi-lesbian foreplay.  After satirizing camp life, the immanent return to the outside world triggers some political correctness.  [Though having the one gay counselor tell the possibly gay-to-be kid to wait until he is 18 before trying anything is not necessarily consistent with what the other kids get to hear.]
The counselors' acting is pretty good. The standouts are Brad Renfro, Dominique Swain, and Justin Long (of ""Jeepers Creepers""; here he is a geeky counselor with a hopeless crush on Wendy and is the buff leader of the kids' water condom-balloon attack on most of the other counselors).
There is the usual hokiness (like an unexpected hurricane), smarmy emerging sexuality, and happy-enough ending.  The DVD had no commentary track or behind-the-scenes materials.  ""Happy Campers"" has a few interesting characters and segments in a familiar setting.",1024704000,21,1678,5.361216730038023

1717515,2,B000067J13,"A group of teenaged camp councilors take over the running of a Summer camp after the camp director is struck by lightening.

I have just finished rewatching through my Daniel Waters collection and ""Happy Campers"" is by far the weakest of the lot. Waters, who also wrote ""Heathers"", ""Hudson Hawk"", ""Batman Returns"", and ""Demolition Man"", generally writes scripts with strong, often far-fetched, plot lines that are enhanced by interesting and often psychotic characters. However, in ""Happy Campers"", his directorial debut, Waters moves away from the pattern that he established in his earlier works, and produces a character-driven piece the is completely unfocussed and leads absolutely nowhere. It's not that the film is completely without merit, the cast (which includes Brad Renfro, Dominique Swain, Justin Long, Emily Bergl and James King) is strong and Waters' trademark black humour is still there. However, there are just too many characters in the film for proper character development and the lack of focus makes it difficult to remain interested at times. This film promises a lot but fails to deliver and the ending is one of the lamest I have seen in my entire life.",1209600000,,1178,5.167539267015707
1717516,2,B000067J13,"""Happy Campers"" is a useful movie only because it prompts basic questions about its writer/director Daniel Waters and his breakout film ""Heathers"" (which he wrote but did not direct). Did he use up all his good stuff writing the Heathers screenplay and have nothing left for ""Happy Campers? Did he lose most of his active brain cells shortly after making Heathers (an event that would account for both the 'Hudson Hawk""and the ""Happy Campers"" screenplays)? Was Heathers just a happy accident? Or is Heathers so open-ended that critics and viewers attributed significance to a very ordinary movie. All these explanations are possible either jointly or collectively.

For ""Happy Campers"" Waters tries to weave ""Breakfast Club"" themes into a ""Meatballs"" story. So you get tedious voice-over suggestions about how the artificial bounds of the high school hierarchy can sometimes be bridged by spending a couple months together as summer camp counselors. Like each detention server in ""The Breakfast Club"", each counselor is an easily identified stereotype. And over the course of camp each is supposed to go through changes, at least that appears to be the premise.

Unfortunately the script has difficulty communicating this process despite an unprecedented amount of voice-over narration. All seven of the main characters get some voice-over time, a device that is very confusing and pretty much destroys any possibility of the movie having any unified theme.

Dominique Swain has the biggest part as Wendy, the terminally peppy cheerleader type (appropriately pictured in a cheerleader outfit on the DVD). Swain is the only good thing about the movie, it is an over-the-top caricature that plays to her acting strengths. This is the type of role Swain should be playing, one that requires self-parody rather than subtlety. She also benefits by relative comparison to James (Jaime) King-whose acting skills are in the Kathy Ireland mold, as well as from being paired with the physically miscast Brad Renfro-who manages to drain all energy from each scene in which he appears. The other four counselors have a fair about of screen time and some lame misadventures but nothing particularly memorable.

Some effort is made to introduce the actual summer campers to the story but none of it even remotely works. ""Meatballs"" was able to get away with shallow character development because it was basically just a Bill Murray vehicle. Although Swain might have been able to carry the whole thing like Murray the script does not allow this and things never really get going in ""Happy Campers"".

Waters apparently believed that audiences would react positively to a movie where 90% of the comedy involved sexual references that most preteens would consider moronic. Hey Daniel, did you pay someone to write that Heathers"" screenplay for you.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1128988800,,2878,5.178494623655914
1717517,5,B000067J13,"What I mean to say is that if you've done the camp thing before and are of a propper age, you'll understand and like this movie. Some of the humor in this is not meant for the young on's. Ive been going to summer camp since I was 7 and have since worked at that camp.  I'm 11 years older (I'm 18 now) and wiser; I know the dark sexually drived stuff on the part of the staffers, about how at night u get with your fellow staffers and talk about the opposite sex, sex, and sexuality in general.  That's exactly what this movie is with its seven 19yr old staff members, each with their first year of college and extreme persona behind them.  The staff does try to hide the darker things (well, no, that's not exactly true) infact, i like the movie so much because all the campers knew what was going on with staff (better than the staff at times) and all real summer campers know to evesdrop on the cool older staff. The staffers in the movie find the naitivity around them charming and indulge their campers' curiosities and questions; either that or they have no control over their emotional outbursts.  It actually is a sweet, well-acted, dark comedy.  About summer love (gag me with a spoon), fate (double gag me) but mainly about the relationships between staffers, campers, and how the two groups mingle. Anyway, part of it is about first love but it is not mushy romance, guys and girls alike will enjoy this, and while it won't be the camp you went to, u recognize the components of the movie that relate to your camp. and it's just hysterical. The movie IS camp condensed into an hour and a half with different aesthetics.  So, yeah, i love this movie, me and my camp buddies get a kick out of it, i hope this helps

Oh, if you're a fan of Heathers (made by the same guy) like me then you won't be disapointed with this, unless u liked all the suicides in Heathers and find them a necessity for a film to be enjoyable",1124064000,3,1924,4.313019390581718
1717518,1,B000067J13,Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!  It was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were.  The only redeeming actor was Justin Long.  The rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells.,1119312000,2,300,4.192982456140351
1717519,2,B000067J13,"I enjoy watching teen movies because I'm ever so curious about how the director sees this particular age group and the misconceptions present in his view as much as in the teens' view of things.

This movie is unlike most teen ""romantic comedies"" I've seen, and not necessarily in a good way. First of all, the main characters are unlikeable and don't represent actual categories of people in real life:

 We have the good looking rebel who's actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back to his old ways (stupid twist if you ask me), the nerd who can't get any (they picked the worst possible guy to play the nerd; he's actually pretty good looking and a funny guy...), the nerdy girl who hasn't grown up yet (ends up hooking up with the rebel but they break up), the gay guy (I have no idea what his role in this movie was), the aggressive victim of child abuse (...), the freaky nympho with a tint of lesbian (what the hell were you thinking Daniel Waters?) and finally the rebel's childhood best friend who falls in love with him and is rejected (the film focuses about 5 minutes of its total 88 on this character... I don't know why she's even here, she has no obvious role and her situation doesn't reflect at all in the real world).

Next up, I think the director is sexually obsessed or something. Ok, I know sex is an important part of a teenager's life but this movie is about lame 13 year old girls aching for sex and even lamer 19 year olds who have nothing else better to do. If I wanted to see hormonal imbalance, I would go watch Discovery Channel. There are more important things in life than sex, and this ""masterpiece"" definitely doesn't illustrate them. The characters' thoughts and actions are limited to the camp itself and the director focuses too much on useless stuff and tries to create stereotypes, but fails miserably. Most teen movies have a moral side to them, they teach the audience certain values, unlike ""Happy Campers"". This movie only taught me that it's so cool to be obsessed about sex, it's cool for 12 year old girls to think they're oh-so-hot women, that only the absolute best looking guys hook up (not true in the real world) and more [...]. Also the director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal, such as the camp leader getting hit by lightning and then acting completely weird, the counsellors buying 47203 boxes of condoms (there's only so much sex you can have in 40 days...), the whole ""Don't-touch-me Todd"" thing, and so on and so forth.

This movie isn't worth the $2 I paid to rent it. Those who think this is better than the American Pie series should go out more. American Pie was a work of art, this is a piece of [...].",1104537600,4,2698,4.50920245398773
1717520,2,B000067J13,"It wasn't all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for you",1091145600,,1019,4.666666666666667
1717521,5,B000067J13,"The only responsible adult holding the reigns at Camp Bleeding Dove states that the key to beautiful co-ed interaction is wholesome activity void of hormones (""...constant supervision...generators start to rumble!""). But when he's unable to oversee what's going on, the counselors replace color war fun with boxes and boxes of condoms.
You have the naive goody-goody, the control freak, and the nerd among other generalizations... it's amusing, watching each oddball personality handle the campers while finding out who they are.
It's a lot of fun, with enough truth and message in it to keep it smart. (...)",1080777600,6,608,5.278350515463917
1717522,4,B000067J13,"Today, teen comedies involve a lot crude humor and the kids just never learn anything.  ""Happy Campers"" has BOTH, and mixes them well which will satisfy a wide audience.  Why I never saw this movie get a national release is beyond me.  This movie was ten times better then American Pie's or any of the other lousy and souless teen movies.
What was written in this movie growing up I lived through.  One character in the movie goes off on the same feelings I once had.
This story really taps into what kids go through today.  This is a must watch folks, sit back and enjoy some laughs as well as somethings to think about from you youth or if you are in this age group of the kids in the film they might cover issues and feelings you are currently going through.
