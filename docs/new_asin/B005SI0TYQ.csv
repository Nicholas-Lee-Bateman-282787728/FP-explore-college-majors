4885324,5,B005SI0TYQ,for starters the answer to why dill is on the cover this dvd has the first 5 episodes of season 6 on it which feature dill. Also 1 episode of season 5 is on the season 4 set. I know its all weird but we do have all the episodes so far aside from that 2nd half of season 2! So even if they bleed over on diff sets at least they're all there. Other specs for you that aren't listed on the site is its a 4 disc set and 372 mins.,1317945600,,425,3.5806451612903225
4885325,5,B005SI0TYQ,"I would suggest for others consideration that the first 5 seasons of this iconic mid-90's series were its best. I have been wanting to own those specific seasons for years now, and while I wish they were proper sets with some extra features, I'll gladly take these season 3, 4 and 5 releases to go along with the first two seasons that were released this way over two years ago.

I own the first two season and have never had issues with them, despite them being DVD-R's which are inferior quality dicss. The picture looks how I remember it from television, not cleaned up but not noticeably worse, they also take time to produce basic menus and artwork that are fitting for the series.

The following episodes from 1997/98 are included in this set:

83 Grandpa's Bad Bug / Lady Luck
84 Hiccups / Autumn Leaves
85 Crime And Punishment / Baby Maybe
86 Word Of The Day / Johnathan Babysits
87 He Saw, She Saw / Piggy's Pizza Palace
88 Fugitive Tommy / Visiting Aunt Miriam
89 The First Cut / Chuckie Grows
90 Uneasy Rider / Where's Grandpa?
91 The Wild Wild West / Angelica For A Day
92 Babysitting Fluffy / Sleep Trouble
93 Journey To The Center Of The Basement / A Very McNulty Birthday
94 The Family Tree

Someday I still hope they would at least bundle together the first five seasons (and perhaps the movie) with at least some minimal special features, they could then release the other seasons and the second movie in another set. Though I doubt it ever happens I'll always hope in the back of my mind.

Now the question is will they go back and release what they ommitted from the second season? It wouldn't take much for a season 2 Part 2 set and they wouldn't have to admit any wrong, but we'll see. Odd choice to have Dil on the cover of this season rather than Phil and Lil, since Dil doesn't technically appear until the film, despite these episodes being a precursor to his arrival.",1317859200,7,1893,4.412607449856734
4885356,5,B005SI0TYQ,Don't laugh but I'm 11 and I love rugrats the thing is this show would be nothing without Angelica. She tells the babies what to do and everything. but I watched a rugrats theory that the babies are Angelicas imagination that's stupid.,1434499200,,235,4.619047619047619
4885357,5,B005SI0TYQ,Rugrats is a great show. This one is great seeing as Dil is added to the rugrats gang,1433721600,,85,3.7777777777777777

4885360,4,B005SI0TYQ,"All DVD's Worked perfectly, My 4 year old daughter loves the Rugrats. My only disappointment is that the case arrived broken so no longer closes properly and dvd's do not fit in case well.",1420934400,,188,4.5588235294117645
4885361,4,B005SI0TYQ,"I received this particular season as a Christmas present, and I have to say, good season, good season! We see several good episodes in this one, including Grandpa's Bad Bug, which originally premiered as a direct to video release on the video cassette Dr. Tommy Pickles, The Word of the Day where Angelica curses for the first time, originally released as a direct to video release on the video cassette titled Angelica Nose Best, not to mention, it was stated by fan Steve Mindacowski that he'd mark that his all time favorite episode, as you always had to imagine what Angelica was saying when she cursed, as it was always covered up by some other noise, his unofficial online website gives more details of what bleeped out Angelica's bad word, but anyway, we also see Chuckie have his second crush on a girl, Emma, they journey to the center of the basement to rescue Reptar Junior, Tommy gets his first cut, and Didi learns she's expecting a new baby.

I will say that I feel this season, since it led up to The Rugrats Movie, could have featured a special feature, which would have been the half hour special of the making of The Rugrat Movie, which, so far, I've only been able to find a copy of it on Youtube, it was recorded in Austrailia, it had commercials included, cutting off the very end of the special, and, you can only hear the sound through one earpiece when using headphones. Since it wasn't included as a bonus on The Rugrats Movie DVD, I was hoping they would have included it on season 5 of Rugrats as a bonus, but sadly, they didn't. And I'll admit, I only know that such a special exists because of learning about it on the unofficial Rugrats website.

I was also surprised, that this season had 4 discs, as I always thought season 5 only had 11 episodes in total, placing 4 on each disc, or in the case with this one, 5 on disc 1, 4 on disc 2, and placing the final 2 episodes on disc 3, but I soon learned that The Family Tree wasn't indeed, the season finale for season 5, as a few of the episodes to feature baby Dil are also on this 4 disc collection. The episodes featuring Dil are as followed, and can be found on discs 3 and 4 of the set.

Chuckie's Duckling and A Dog's Life
Chuckerfly and Angelica's Twin
Raising Dil and No Naps
Man of the House and A Whole New Stu
Baking Dil and Hair
Submarine and Chuckie's a Lefty

I was so surprised to find that Chuckie's a Lefty ended up closing out season 5, as up until this point, I always thought The Family Tree episode ended season 5, followed by The Rugrats Movie, and Dil burst on to regular episodes, beginning with season 6. It's amazing the things you learn that you never thought you knew, but still, what a nice surprise.

It's definitely another great season for any Rugrat fan to own, and I recommend it to everyone!",1419724800,3,2805,4.365900383141763

4885366,5,B005SI0TYQ,"A few episodes of Rugrats' 6th season ended up here due to what I said in my review of season 4, thus making this a 4-disc set instead of only 3 discs. In this set alone, we get to see what life was like for the Rugrats and the ""growed ups"" before AND after Dil came into the picture. This was the final season to have actor David Doyle playing Grandpa Lou, due to his passing, and the first one where Joe Alaskey took his place as Grandpa Lou. Alaskey was already famous for providing the voices of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester and Tweety in this period in toon history, and would eventually be Toon Disney's main announcer guy for a bunch of years, not counting Jetix, whose own main announcer guy was Digimon actor Brian Donovan. Also in this season are the voices of Hanna-Barbera legend John Stephenson (as Lou's doctor video narrator), and those of 2 future Digimon actresses; Philece Sampler (as Emma, Big Binky's little sister) and Mona Marshall (as the teething baby who got Tommy framed for popping the McNulty brothers' ball, and other roles in the whole series), both of whom had big roles (and small ones) in Digimon's first 5 seasons! What's more, Aunt Miriam's second appearance in the series is here, as always voiced by Andrea Martin (who played Ms. Carbunkle in Frosty Returns, Ms. Meany in the New Woody Woodpecker Show, and eventually Mrs. Gristlepuss on SpongeBob). What bugs me about my copy of season 5 is during He Saw, She Saw, the picture and sound get buggy for a few seconds, and during Visiting Aunt Miriam, the picture got glitchy for a second, but those are the only glitches I could find in my set. Other escapades in this set include Angelica learning a new word from Ms. Carol to the grownups' horror, the Rugrats in a Chuck E. Cheese's sort of place, Stu and Didi's big news about Dil, Tommy getting his first (and second) cut, Chuckie being a big brother to a newborn duckling, Grandpa Lou trying to get a ""pot"" from Aunt Miriam and her friends in a card game, the babies in a Western picture, Chuckie babysitting Fluffy while trying to avoid the grownups' retarring Chas' driveway (to gruesome results, and Fluffy needing an extensive haircut!), Chuckie and Angelica switching shoes (and personalities), Angelica pretending to have a twin sister named Ballina, Timmy McNulty's birthday party having a ""monstrous"" cootie-filled case of BGS (Boy/Girl Syndrome), Tommy and Dil discovering their new car with Chuckie's help, Tommy and Chuckie being in ""Canada"" in a much hotter climate, Chuckie discovers that he's left-handed (and so was his Daddy!), and more! Even with the extra episodes from season 6 in here, I discovered that the 5th season of Rugrats is the only season in the whole series to not have a holiday episode of any sort. So now you know why Dil is on the 5th season's DVD cover. If you're after the whole Rugrats series on DVD, don't forget the youngest Rugrat! Around the time The Rugrats Movie debuted in theatres, E.G. Daily and Tara Strong not only played Tommy and Dil, but also two-thirds of The Powerpuff Girls (respectively Buttercup and Bubbles), from then on. Starting here, and in the first movie, Tommy learns to be a caring big brother, much better than his own Daddy and Uncle Drew ever got along. You live and learn with the Rugrats!",1405555200,5,3305,4.680412371134021

4885372,4,B005SI0TYQ,Season 5 is a great Collection of Rug Rats for anyone who enjoys them. The only downside was the packaging for the 4 Disc set. My set came with a damaged inner case so two discs could not be held safely. Easy fix with some slimline cases and the use of a color copy machine to make a second cover.

4885375,2,B005SI0TYQ,"I won't lie, I knew what I was buying when I purchased this collection of episodes.  But it doesn't change the fact that the use of ""season"" in the title is an absolute case of false advertisement.  My kids have just recently became Rugrats fans, and I figured Amazon would be a good place to get some of the episodes for them.  The term ""season"" is used to represent a handful of Phil and Lil focused stories, each running around 12 minutes.  The quality is standard, so no complaints there.  I'm just a sucker for semantics, and this product pushes the wrong buttons.",1348272000,2,569,4.485436893203883
