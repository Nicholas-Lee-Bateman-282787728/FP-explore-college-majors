1806321,5,B00007CVS4,"The summit of preCode Hollywood, and Ernst Lubitsch at his zenith. First things first: thank you to Public Media for finally releasing this.
I waited 25 years to see this one again, and the wait was not in vain. Those 25 years put a bit of snow on my roof, but they also allowed me to savor the vintage ambrosia of this film with a more appreciative palate than I had at 16; and what a nose-tickling hit of the grape it is. Script, performances, directorial vision are all exquisitely crafted. The leads are inspired (Kay Francis is at her liveliest and most alluring here); the supporting players, expertly calibrated farceurs. The utilization of music as ironic counterpoint to the visuals rivals Clair without resembling him: the title song, sung over the opening credits, will make your heart race, and break, at the same time. And the look of the film (Art Deco, lovingly handrubbed to a burnished glow) lingers fondly in your memory long after viewing.
Again and again, Lubitsch pulls understated rabbits out of hats: scenes like the deepening of Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis' relationship from business to pleasure 'seen' in a clock face are emblematic of what makes this such a special film. Its story is slight, silly and stagey, but Lubitsch's knowing observation of small, telling details - and his easy, sure hand with the broader elements - makes this sparkling foam froth with real magic.
TROUBLE is not a timeless film, anchored as it is to a very specific time (Long Ago) and place (Far Away), which only deepens its charm and its seductive tugging on the audience's sleeve. I've watched it three times in a night, and three times more the following night - not behavior I usually exhibit. But the siren call of its lively, civilized wit is such that I'm hitting 'rewind' the moment it ends - I don't want to break the spell and return to reality just yet. As fertile as the preCode era was, as many underheralded gems as that period continues to yield up to seekers, TROUBLE may be the most glorious of them all.",1066176000,3,2033,4.681564245810056
1806322,5,B00007CVS4,"I cannot add any more to the praise heaped on this sophisticated comedy.  However, for those cinephiles wondering about the picture quality:  it is very grainy.  By comparison, the transfer of ""Rebecca"" is nearly flawless, and even ""The Lady Eve"", which I have heard complaints about, looks relatively good.  Also, the introduction with Bogdanovich is excellent and has some nice background info and photos of Lubitsch.  The short film isn't much to look at, and the tributes are just written and typed, not video.  A terrific film, I just wish I could have seen a less grainy version.  It could have been marvelous...divine...wonderful....",1056931200,4,640,5.155339805825243
1806323,5,B00007CVS4,"What more can I say about this film that the other reviewers have not already said. Not only does this film display in my OPINION the best example of the ""Lubitsch Touch""it display a certain pinache that Hollywood may never recover. If you are into the likes of Kate & Leopold or Jim Carrey stay away from this one. This film is for serious cinema lovers and students. This is one small example of why CRITERION are the classiest and best in the film and DVD world. This is a CLASSIC.",1055376000,,484,4.329670329670329
1806324,5,B00007CVS4,"Splendid to see such a wonderful DVD transfer of TROUBLE IN PARADISE, Lubitsch's first talkie masterpiece.  The wavishing Kay Fwancis and Herbert Marshall make the most skillful of romantic leads, and even Miriam Hopkins (a strong contender for most irritating actress in pictures until Madonna hit the screen) is a delight.  Wonderful supporting work from the stalwart Charles Ruggles and Edward Everett Horton, and a nice turn from that Gallic favorite, C. Aubrey Smith.  Great extras (bright, informative commentary from the leading Lubitsch scholar, and the German silent included is a real treat).  The only downside to a viewing of TROUBLE IN PARADISE is you'll be extremely unhappy when you open today's movie ads and realize popular entertainment has fallen from these heights to the likes of JACKASS, THE REAL CANCUN, and Jim Carrey running amok.  Thanks, Criterion, for helping to preserve such a glorious film heritage!  Can we hope for TO BE OR NOT TO BE in the future?",1051574400,12,981,5.1
1806325,5,B00007CVS4,"Ernst Lubitsch's TROUBLE IN PARADISE is probably not the first film you think of when you hear the director's name.  To Be Or Not To Be and Little Shop Around the Corner may have greater fame, but no film better displays the fabled ""Lubitsch touch"" than Trouble in Paradise.
Here's the inspired premise: Charming scoundrels Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins become personal assistants to Kay Francis, a rich and beautiful Parisian widow. Their plan is to loot her fortune, but she's so dazzlingly urbane, elegant and sophisticated that he becomes smitten, and visa versa.
Set first in romantic Venice and then in an art deco dream of Paris, the complications in this tantalizing triangle offer timeless insights into the machinations of the heart.
Trouble in Paradise is one of the best comedies ever made, screwball or otherwise. Every word, glance and gesture is perfect. Highest recommendation.
Lots of extras.",1046390400,17,915,5.140939597315437
1806326,5,B00007CVS4,"This is not likely the first film that comes to mind when people mention Ernst Lubitsch.  Little Shop Around the Corner and To Be or Not TO Be are both frequent fliers on TNT, and feature exquisite performances by some of the era's best loved stars, ie. Stewart, Lombard and Benny.  A director would have to be proud of having either one of them designated as his crowning achievement.
  While Trouble in Paradise is graced by two wonderful supporting actors, the squabbling Edward Everett Horton and Charlie Ruggles, the leads for this film are not exactly household names.  (I always associate Kay Francis with with sublime chaos of the Marx Brothers first stab at the talkies.)  That the three leads manage such effervescence is a strong indication of the talent of the director.  They manage to suavely seduce the audience just as they entice one another on screen.
  This is a superb adult comedy, and not a bad date movie at that. Just how historically great or influential it is may be best left to the critics, but just standing on its own, it's undeniably one hell of an elegant piece of entertainment,",1045353600,7,1111,4.715025906735751
1806327,5,B00007CVS4,"On a moonlit evening an aristocratic man invites a woman of noble birth to his hotel suit for a late supper; however, she is observed as she enters the hotel and scandal is imminent.  Meanwhile, it seems like someone has been robbed in the same hotel.  The upper-class woman proclaims to the aristocratic man that he is the thief, and in return he says that he felt her hand inside the jacket when she picked his pocket.  This is the beginning of the romance between two grand thieves that crosses paths with the beautiful Madame Mariette Colet who has inherited a fortune from her father.  Trouble in Paradise is a witty comedy that pushes the envelop in a 1930s Hollywood in regards to sensuality and sexuality, which will charm and amuse the audience.",1042588800,,754,4.646616541353383
1806328,5,B00007CVS4,"There is very little I can add to the other reviewer's' praise of this film.  Suffice it to say that in it's lighter than air way, Trouble in Paradise manages to achieve something close to perfection.  Each image, each line, each line reading seems perfectly timed and delivered creating one of the most exquisite films ever made.  A slippery, surprising and astonishingly beautiful piece of film making.  It's reputation is not undeserved.
Any quibbles I have with this disk has nothing to do with the film itself but with the presentation.  The film is very old (1932) and some aging and artifacts are to be expected. However, the justly famous opening sequence is so dark and the details so muted as to be barely discernible.  Every time the camera floats outside and into the dark during the first part of the film--detail is lost.  The good news is that all of the indoor scenes are bright and sharp and possess good contrast. Criterion has obviously done some extensive cleaning and work on the film because other than the night scenes (too bad about Miriam Hopkin's entrance in a gondola) the film looks great  Also the sound while maintaining a slight hiss throughout is free of any pops or crackles and is very clear. I have seen cleaner sharper prints of this film than the one that Criterion apparently got from Universal (Universal was responsible for the slightly soft and faded print of The Scarlet Empress that Crtierion released as well).  Other than this complaint the print is generally fine with only minor scratches present  primarily at some of the dissolves and edits.
The disc includes several great extras that are worth perusing for even casual fans of Lubitsch.  Scott Eyman a Lubitsch biographer provides a nice commentary featuring lots of behind the scenes information, biographical info, the place of Trouble in Paradise in comparison with Lutbitsch's other films and its influence on other film comedies of the period as well as some interpretation of some of the film and its famous sequences.  In addition to this, Criterion has managed to include a forty minute silent film by Lubitsch--""The Merry Jail"" that shows a different style but includes some of the elements that would make Trouble in Paradise such a gem.  There is also an introduction by film historian/director Peter Bogdanovich that provides his insight into the significance of the film.  A very nice feature that runs about ten minutes.  There is also a radio program featuring Lubitsch with a group of Hollywood luminaries, fascinating but one longs for visuals of this event,  and the standard Criterion essay included with the chapter menu insert. Finally there are some written tributes to Lubitsch from some of his contemporaries, as well as current film makers and critics.  This is a text only feature but sometimes features the comments in the writer's own handwriting.
Overall, I'd have to recommend this disk wholeheartedly.  Criterion deserves huge praise just for making this masterpiece available for the home viewer and they also manage to include wonderful extras that support the film beautifully. The presentation is a little flawed but it is more than adequate to appreciate the treasure on display.",1042329600,41,3216,5.00187617260788
1806366,5,B00007CVS4,This is truly one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. The cast is outstanding and the chemistry undeniable.,1438214400,2,119,5.0
1806367,5,B00007CVS4,"Critics wrote raving reviews for this movie, released in 1932, at the height of Great Depression, and they still have not stopped yet! It is a sophisticated comedy of director Ernst Lubitsch, but in 1932 the audience response was not sensational and it did not receive any nominations for the movie in which quintessential Lubitsch displayed his directorial talents with smooth narrative comedy. It has a delicate eroticism and verbal wit but Lubitsch brings out something special from every actor in this film.

Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins play a pair of jewel thieves and prey upon a wealthy socialite played by Kay Francis. When Marshall falls in love with Kay, Miriam is not too happy and some of the best dialogues of the movie come out when they fight about the lost love. In supporting roles; Charles Ruggles, Edward Everett Horton, and Aubrey Smith perform splendidly.

1806375,5,B00007CVS4,"""The Lubitsch Touch"" at its most sublime in this romantic-comedy jewel. Unseen for decades thanks to Production Code censorship, the refreshingly adult ""Trouble in Paradise"" (1932) gets better with age. You couldn't ask for a more stylish love triangle than Miriam Hopkins, Kay Francis and Herbert Marshall - surrounded by colorful supporting players and Hans Dreier's impressive Art Deco sets.

1806397,5,B00007CVS4,"""Trouble in Paradise,"" (1932), a romance/screwball comedy/crime picture, is one of the greatest pre-World War II, pre- repressive Hays code Hollywood classics.  It's a brisk, farcical, sophisticated 83 minute black and white Paramount confection.  It's funny, subtle, silly, sexy, with attitude galore, a starry cast, and world-famous talent behind the camera, too. The underlying play, ""A Becsuletes Megtalalo"" (The Honest Finder), was written by Aladar Laszlo; it opened in Budapest, Hungary, in December 1931.  The uber-witty screen play was by the respected Samson Raphaelson; the refugee Ernst Lubitsch,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Design-for-Living-Criterion-Collection/dp/B005ND87UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Design for Living (Criterion Collection)</a>), master of the lighter than air, produced and directed: it is the most widely known of his films. The ""Lubitsch touch"" as his style was called, emphasized subtlety and elegance, expressive of good taste; it was economical about what to show, relying on the audience to fill in the gaps.  Many greatly admired movie reviewers - who actually get paid for their work--consider this a near-perfect film, and who am I to disagree?

It is largely set in a gorgeous art nouveau Paris, though it opens in Venice.  Gaston Monescu, a high-class gentleman thief, has met his soul mate Lily, a lovely femme pickpocket, masquerading as a countess, in Venice.  They decide to join forces to con Madame Mariette Colet, a beautiful widowed Parisienne perfume company owner.  Gaston takes a job  as Mme. Colet's personal secretary under the alias Monsieur Laval. Rumors start to fly as 'M. Laval' steals Mme. Colet away from her more suitable suitors. And when the secret of his actual identity catches up to him, Gaston is caught between the two beautiful  women: to stay, to flee...

Monescu was played by Herbert Marshall, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Foxes/dp/B00005LOLB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Foxes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foreign-Correspondent/dp/B0002HOEQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foreign Correspondent</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Letter/dp/B000055XM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Letter</a>); Lily by Lubitsch favorite Miriam Hopkins, (DESIGN FOR LIVING); and Madame Colet by Kay Francis, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Name-Only/dp/B0058K5SD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Name Only</a>). Internet sources say the director first considered younger actors, such as Cary Grant, for these roles, but decided he wanted performers whose faces reflected some maturity as they attempted to nimbly navigate all the obstacles to satisfaction that Lubitsch threw in their paths.  So he cast the 42-year old Marshall and two no-longer ingnues in his lead parts.  Rom/com stalwarts Charles Ruggles as the Major; Edward Everett Horton as Francois Filiba; C. Aubrey Smith as Adolph J. Giron;  Robert Greig as Jacques, Mariette's butler and Leonid Kinskey as the communist round out the mittel-Europa-flavored cast.  Paris has never looked lovelier; interiors are gleamingly shot and full of Hans Dreier's striking Art Deco designs.  The women look their best in gowns by Travis Banton.

Director Lubitsch had fled Nazi Germany for Hollywood; Germany's loss was Hollywood's gain.  As noted above, he was particularly praised for ""the Lubitsch touch,"" which involved split second timing, and a bubbling, buoyant erotic wit.  In those days before the promulgation of the blue-nose Hays Code, Lubitsch was able to sneak quite a bit of innuendo into his films. This movie was popular both with critics and with audiences, but, after 1935, when the production code began to be enforced, it was withdrawn from circulation.  It  was not seen again until 1968. The film was never available on videocassette and only became available on DVD in 2003.  Oddly enough, or perhaps not so oddly, I have recently seen or re-seen four of Lubitsch's pictures, and all four center around romantic triangles, two of each flavor.  This one is sublimely, elegantly sweet and spicy: a Hungarian palacinka to treasure again and again.",1360540800,3,4308,6.2521150592216586

1806399,5,B00007CVS4,"For romantic comedy no one excelled, and few matched, great director Ernst Lubitsch, who brought a sophisticated European touch to Hollywood movies. Trouble in Paradise is his most typical film and his best: a delightfully witty cinematic confection whose froth conceals a sly underlying cynicism. The story concerns upper-class jewel thieves running a scam against a rich Parisian widow; the cast are uniformly wonderful. See it, you'll like it! Unrated but no particular advisories, despite mildly adult situations: the sexiness is pervasive but artfully concealed.

1806401,5,B00007CVS4,"This 1932 film, the first talking film by Lubitsch is a dear moment of pleasure. It is a comedy but the comedy is a lot more subtle than anyone may think.

It is about a crook who meets a thief and they fall in love but then they plan schemes that are so big it is amazing how easy they seem to be. They plan an operation that would capture a fair amount of cash, and some jewels, from the heiress and boss of the first cosmetic (in those days it was mainly perfume) business in Paris and probably the world. It sounds like L'Oreal so much that the only difference between the young widow who is heading the business and Ms Bettencourt who has finally been court-ordered out of freely managing and using her money is their age.

Yet that did not prevent the gay photographer who had been her late husband's lover to take her over and manipulate her like a piece a play dough. Never too old to be submitted to that game.

The second difference is that the crooks are a couple and the danger for them is that the man may fall for the heiress, really fall I mean, and that solution is caressed for a short while but the dramatic suspense it creates is short lived in the end.

The third interest is that the film clearly shows how the main board member of the business is using his position to enrich himself with discrete transfers from the business accounts to his own knowing that the heiress or boss or widow will never understand the procedure but the new secretary who is the crook and thief who infiltrated the business to get to the lady's safe knows about it at once and can reveal it. It takes a crook to know another.

But then how funny it is to see the victim of all these rotten crooks refusing to call the police because of the scandal it would create. They did not know yet that a good and deep scandal is the best publicity for a business, as long as the scandal does show any support to the wrong side, and there Lubitsch is a very subtle man. The crooked board member who is stealing from the business on a regular basis has a secret first name he does not like. In 1932, guess twice what it could be? Adolf of course, and even if you write it the French way Adolphe it does not change and in the film it sounds just like Adolf, the other Adolf of 1932 who was starting to loom high over Europe.

But a funny film after all far from such political considerations. Is it now so far from these political considerations?

I bought the Criterion DVD when it came out back in 2003 and at the time felt the print was fine.  But at this stage of the digital evolution, I feel that is no longer the case.  We need a restored version soon!

1806405,5,B00007CVS4,"A few months ago TCM was doing a Miriam Hopkins marathon and they played (back-to-back-to-back) her collaborations with famed director Ernst Lubitsch.  `Trouble in Paradise' was my least favorite of the three (`The Smiling Lieutenant' is utterly delicious, and `Design for Living' thrives magically off its cheeky demeanor), but it is the only one I can review solitary (as in, it is the only one available on DVD alone and not included in a collection of musicals or Gary Cooper classics).  That said, it is a marvelous film that showcases the talent of all involved, and it has garnered (much deservedly) a large fanbase.

Attracted to one another based on a similar love of crime, Lily and Gaston become quick lovers and even quicker partners.  When they embark on ripping off a wealthy widow the pair becomes divided when Gaston actually falls for his target.

What makes this rather rudimentary tale work so well is the comedic intelligence that seeps off of the actors (and director) onto every frame.  It is so pristinely staged and choreographed that everything manages to feel `just right'.  It's a quality that could work against it had it been overly mechanical in delivery, but the actors are so effortless and naturally comfortable with their place in the picture that they elevate the script and make it so charming and unforgettable.

Herbert Marshall has the responsibility of carrying this entire film.  Sure, he has help from his leading ladies, but both Miriam Hopkins and the effervescent Kay Francis share his time.  He is in nearly every scene and has to juggle both beauties, and he does so marvelously.  They make him work for it though.  Miriam is just spot-on perfection as the suspicious con-artist Lily.  She oozes with a sensual appeal, yet she has a hardness about her that gives her that `tough girl' persona.  You want to obey her, because you know if you don't she is going to be mean to you (or maybe you want to disobey her for the very same reason).  Of the three collaborations with Lubitsch, this is not my favorite performance from her (that came in `Design for Living') but this is definitely one of the most recognizable.  Her finest performance was in `Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (for which she should have won the Oscar), but that's for another discussion entirely.  The real star of the show for me was Kay Francis.  She is delightfully aware of her character here, delivering a beautifully sincere and well mannered portrayal of a woman desperate for affection, so desperate that she sidesteps her own instincts.

And she is gorgeous.

With elegance that could fill a ballroom and comedic timing that rivals the (better) comedies of today, `Trouble in Paradise' is the role model that all romantic comedies should strive to emulate.  It is fresh and funny and ridiculously charming, and with a slew of Oscar worthy performances (and that raved after `Lubitsch touch') this truly becomes a must see, must love, must own kind of movie!",1257465600,5,2975,4.851485148514851

Watch for the scenes where there is just a hint of somone's involvement in something  like Marshall exiting the opera and figure out what he has with him - lovely Lubitsch touches.  It is enjoyable and delightful when you see who ends up with or without Kay Frances/Miriam Hopkins, H. Marshall and the suitors of Kay Frances who are Charles Ruggles (the major) and Everett Horton.

Kay Francis and Miriam Hopkins pair well together, and had done so earlier in the film ""24 Hours"".  Kay later accompanied Miriam to Reno, Nevada for her divorce from the noted Director Anatol Litvak.  They remained, unlike in this film, friends for life.  This film is considered to be the best Romantic Comedy Motion Picture ever made.  This was true at the time, and in my humble opinion continues to be true to this day.  This film is the mark by which all future films of this genre (if they are at all made today) will be judged.  The cast is perfect including the inimitable Edward Everett Horton.

1806419,5,B00007CVS4,"Trouble In Paradise is a well crafted comedy with action, some drama and a plot that will hold your attention all throughout the film. The casting was very well done and we get some amazing performances from Miriam Hopkins, Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis in particular. The choreography is superb; and the cinematography reflects good judgment. In addition, the quality of the print is rather good; there are only a few brief moments here and there when there was just a bit of cloudiness in the print.

When the action starts, we meet two lovers: Gaston Monescu (Herbert Marshall) and Lily (Miriam Hopkins). They love to play games and they even con each other; we get some funny moments when at first they refer to each other as the ""Baron"" and the ""Countess."" They have the nearly magical ability to steal things off another person without the other person ever even suspecting a theft of pearls--or a watch, for example. Moreover, Gaston is in a very good mood because he just robbed a very rich man who was staying in a huge suite in a Venetian hotel.

It's not long before Gaston and Lily set their sights on the very well known and fabulously wealthy Madame Mariette Colet (Kay Francis). Gaston and eventually Lily worm their way into Mariette's life; Gaston becomes her secretary almost immediately after meeting Mariette--his phony grace and charm are THAT good. Soon Gaston sees to it that Lily is his own assistant as they make plans to rob Madame Colet of 100,000 French Francs and maybe even more--all the while using aliases to throw potentially suspicious people off their trail.

It's amazing; but after only a few short weeks Gaston actually falls in love with Mariette Colet! Mariette returns his love; and of course Lily feels terribly threatened by all this. After all, Gaston was HER man. Moreover, Mariette has two other suitors both of whom she dislikes; there is ""The Major"" (Charlie Ruggles) and Franois Filiba (Edward Everett Horton). There are more very amusing scenes in which Mariette and Gaston are deciding if she should go out one evening--they practically drive the butler crazy changing their minds every other minute as to whether or not the car for Mariette should wait for her or not.

Of course things can go in different directions. Will Gaston choose Mariette or Lily--and that's if he doesn't get caught and thrown into jail? Who if anyone will eventually discover Gaston as the thief he really is? What happens to Lily? Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with some good extras. Thank goodness for The Criterion Collection of DVD releases! There is an optional introduction by Peter Bogdanovich; an audio only track of a Screen Guild Theater radio program; a commentary by Scott Eyman and a silent film entitled Das Fidele Gefngnis from 1917 that Ernst Lubitsch worked on.

Trouble In Paradise is an excellent Ernst Lubitsch pre-code film that people can easily enjoy to this day. The story is really timeless; it could just as well take place in our times. This film is a ""must-have"" for fans of the great Ernst Lubitsch; and it's a fine early ""talkie"" comedy as well.",1238630400,3,3112,4.807476635514019
1806420,5,B00007CVS4,"i like my comedies as i like my desserts:  not too much sugar but with a lot of flavors.  trouble in paradise delivers just that plus that unmistakable ""lighter than air"" quality which characterizes all lubitsch movies.  the famous lubitsch touch.

this is a movie made before the enforcement of the ""morality"" laden production code of 1935, and it shows.  the movie is laced with sexual innuendo, with racy dialogues.  you do feel the sexual tension between the main characters, it is evoked, impressionistically via the deft touch of the director.  if only directors knew how to make movies this way still, rather than showing us skin and explicit content.

the casting is impeccable, all actors producing stellar performances and sometimes hilarious ones from the supporting cast - think of the scene played out half in english and half in italian when one characters tries to explain how he was robbed by a fake doctor... just priceless.

i particularly enjoy the juxtaposition of the elegant style - in the costumes, the cinematography, the lighting, the dialogues -and the profound lack of morality exhibited by each and all through the pursuit of amusement, wealth and greed.  amorality was never portrayed as exquisitely.

finally, and my personal favorite, lubitsch's use of doors and windows never ceases to amaze me.  how someone could have elevated their use and portrayal of such props to a work of art, constantly opening, closing, going through, transitioning from one to the other without making it trite or obvious is a mystery.

gotta love lubitsch, gotta love trouble in paradise.",1231027200,3,1599,5.057251908396947
1806421,5,B00007CVS4,"One of the most delightful movies I have seen.  Sophisticated comedy of the sort that rarely appears nowadays.  Vintage Ernst Lubitsch; terrific acting by Miriam Hopkins, Kay Francis, and Herbert J. Marshall in his salad days.  Witty, naughty, and never vulgar -- produced just before the Hayes Code was enacted.  Also, the most glorious gold evening dress, worn by Miriam Hopkins.

1806423,5,B00007CVS4,"Pre-code Lubitsch in all its sophisticated, spicy, saucy, cynical, morally ambiguous glory.  Fans of early Astaire-Rogers will love Trouble in Paradise. Those who know Miriam Hopkins only as a foil for Bette Davis will be delighted with her comic timing.  Kay Francis, as the sexually liberated widow, is totally wonderful, Elmer Fudd lisp and all.  Herbert Marshall, Bette Davis' betrayed husband in The Letter, is throughly convincing as a charming gentleman thief.  Two superb character actors, Charlie Ruggles and Edward Everett Horton, show why the were born to play romantic comedy.  Costumes, interiors, script are the best of the period.  And, unlike many comedies of the same vintage, one can watch Trouble in Paradise over and over without cringing.  Source print for this DVD is crisp, sparkling.",1208476800,3,807,5.307086614173229
1806424,4,B00007CVS4,"Trouble in Paradise is a great example of a sophisticated pre-code. It revolves around some thieves played by Herbert Marshall (Gaston) and Miriam Hopkins (Lily). Gaston manages to steal a wealthy woman's purse (Kay Francis) and when she offers a reward for its return, he goes to her and not only secures her trust, but gets a job managing her finances. This is the perfect setup for him and his girlfriend, but when he begins to fall in love with his benefactor, there is trouble.

The high-class humor surrounding the risqu topics are characteristics of director Ernst Lubitsch. His subtle wit floods the film, but it is difficult to describe the entire effect he had on film-making. It is obvious by the documentary-like introduction by Peter Bogdonovich, the audio commentary by Scott Eyman, and the tributes to Lubitsch by various Hollywood figures that his unique touch has left films since the director's death, an unfortunate occurrence.

The 1917 silent film Das fidele Gefangnis (The Merry Jail) is also included. Directed by Lubitsch in Germany, this film is slightly ahead of its time in style. The sets are enormous, especially the home of the couple, though it is not necessary. The cast is very good, particularly Kitty Dewall whose pretty smile lights up the screen. When a husband whose hobby is nightclubbing is sentenced to a night in jail, he decides to skip the jail time for another party. His wife tricks an admirer into serving the time for him while she masquerades as a stranger at the party to see just what her husband is up to while she stays up at night waiting for him.",1149552000,3,1601,4.797101449275362
1806425,5,B00007CVS4,"What a film!  There is absolutely nothing to compare nowadays to the subtle, insinuating, sexy comedy of Ernst Lubitsch. This landmark film is now readily available through this superb Criterion package. The film is perfectly constructed and executed, to be viewed again and again and discover more tricks and nuances each time.

Miriam Hopkins and Herbert Marshall play two thiefs who infiltrate the life of Kay Francis to fleece her. However, Marshall falls for Francis and complications ensue. All the players are terrific.  Miriam Hopkins, who always overacted, works well here in the artificial setting.  Marshall is suave and handsome but it is Kay Francis who steals the film. She is superb.

The DVD print is very good and there is an excellent commentary which identifies carefully throughout the film the director's touch while noting the contribution of writer Samson Raphaelson, Lubitsch's main collaborator. In addition, the DVD contains a very funny radio program in which Lubitsch himself appears with Jack Benny and Claudette Colbert. Also included is an interview with Peter Bogdanavich which summarises the importance of Lubitsch, also reflected in the written comments about the director from famous colleagues, directors and historians. Finally, the package includes a rarely seen German silent film, directed in 1917 by Lubitsch. The film is a marital farce and quite funny, an early demonstration of the skill of the director.",1138752000,4,1448,5.361233480176211
1806446,5,B00007CVS4,"Supremely light in touch, with an unequalled delicacy and compassion for its characters. The effect is achieved not so much through the acting (the actors are the requisite beautiful, attractive people) as by carefully framed shots that create mood, enhance ambience, develop narrative and express a sophisticated, uncompromising and self deprecatory view of life and the place of human beings within it. A romantic comedy where the romance and the comedy are perfectly balanced - with a little bit of magic as well.",1129075200,6,516,5.228915662650603

""Trouble"" is one of his best outings, cheerily touting the marvels of sex and riches.  Along with the rarefied atmosphere, the snappy dialogue and witty ripostes exemplify what came to be called ""The Lubitsch Touch.""

1806448,5,B00007CVS4,"Gentleman thief Gaston Monescu (Herbert Marshall), gentlewoman thief Lily (Miriam Hopkins) and perfume heiress Madame Mariette Colet (Kay Francis) comprise an elegant romantic triangle in a tale of amour and larceny.

  They don't make `em like Ernst Lubitsch's TROUBLE IN PARADISE anymore.  The characters are refined and decorous, the script is sophisticated and witty, the movie is made by adults for other, intelligent adults.  To paraphrase Peter Bogdanovich in his introduction - How far we have fallen!  Watch, listen and read all the extras on this dvd and you too will mourn the passing of the `Lubitsch touch,' even if you're like me and still are a little unclear what exactly the `Lubitsch touch' is.  Perhaps Lubitsch was a recognized auteur before there was an auteur theory. In any event, TROUBLE IN PARADISE is a (very good) cocktail-at-the-Ritz movie, and should be seen by anyone who appreciates old movies.

 Also on the dvd is DAS FIDELE GEFNGNIS  (THE MERRY JAIL) 1917, a silent film Lubitsch that must have been made before he was a genius.  It's about a drunken wastrel of a husband who is summoned to spend a night in jail.  Instead, he attends a party where his disguised wife plays a trick or two on him.  Meanwhile one of the wife's suitors, through a series of events not worth relating, spends the night in jail in the husband's stead.  The oddest character in this odd and vaguely offensive movie is the jail warder, played by Emil Jannings, whose character is potted throughout the film and spends a fair amount of time kissing and making passes at the male inmates.

  The 1940 Screen Guild Theater program is a little more refreshing, especially if you're a fan of Jack Benny, who dominates the proceedings.  Lubitsch plays himself in the program, as do the others - Claudette Colbert, Basil Rathbone, and Benny.",1108857600,6,1845,4.877813504823151
1806449,4,B00007CVS4,"I must admit, Trouble in Paradise is my first Lubitsch.  Herbert Marshal plays a very suave thief predating Hitchcock's, To Catch a Thief, the Cary Grant take on Marshall's roll.  Now Miriam Hopkins is an American that seems to be as suave as Marshal when she needs to impersonate a countess.  They meet and discover their talents as thieves and this gets them very excited sexually.

Kay Francis, the dark haired beauty plays the rich Mariette Colet, and becomes a target of Marshal and Hopkins. While Marshal befriends Francis as a secretary, the boss-employee relationship becomes elegantly steamy.  This kind of elegant love game was the height of sophistication among the very wealthy of the period.  Jewels and pearls are both symbols of the desired object and perhaps bedroom toys.

This film was made in 1932 just before The Code was established.  For this reason, the film nearly disappeared because the triangle between two very different women and a sophisticated rogue dramatizes clearly: they wanted to have sex with each other.  Although there is no nudity, and the lovers are not shown in bed together, Lubitsch has given the film a Continental, an open sexuality, that early talkies had difficulty doing because of the puritan code in the religious United States in the 30's.  Lubitsch has invented the sex comedy for talkies.  Every director is indebted to him.",1099699200,4,1378,5.0
1806450,5,B00007CVS4,"It is hard to say what exactly went wrong in the movie industry. Perhaps it was when adults decided to rent videos instead of actually going to the movies, and the studios looked around to discover the vast majority of their paying customers were under the age of twenty. Movie making is a business, after all. What could a money-strapped studio do but remake Fast Times at Ridgemont High about a million times, sliding a bit lower with each version? The ashes that remain today with regard to screen comedy are fart jokes, self proclaimed ""booty meisters"" mugging like demented monkeys at the site of a woman's ass,  and situational concepts that make it painfully clear that the moguls are fully aware that they are selling this crap to the brain dead.

Then again, perhaps Ernst Lubitsh's Trouble in Paradise was a phantasm all along; some beautiful coincidence - like seeing a falling star out of the corner of your eye at midnight on your birthday. Whatever. To say that they don't make them like that anymore doesn't quite capture it. They must have passed legislation at some point outlawing this kind of sophistication and intelligence. I won't bore you quoting passages or praising individual performances. Suffice to say that this movie won't make you belly laugh once, but I guarantee that you will have a knowing smile on your face from beginning to end.

If you really want to be reminded of the kind of smarts you're capable of, buy this movie.

1806451,5,B00007CVS4,"An absolutely delicious, saucy romantic comedy by famed director Ernst Lubitsch -- a pre-Code gem that fell by the wayside after the dullardly Hayes Code swept through Hollywood.  Miriam Hopkins, Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis are caught in an unusual triangle, as Hopkins and Marshall, a pair of high-stakes con artists, latch onto the wealthy, sexy -- and resolutely single -- Parisian socialite, Mariette Colet (Francis) and plan to rob her blind.  Of course, trouble ensues as the suavely amoral Herbert teeters at the brink of honesty, after he starts to fall for the considerable charms of their intended victim.  Kay Francis steals the show with her smoulderingly sensual performance -- and things  *really*  start to heat up towards the end, when she finally has her way with the dashing young thief -- if you're looking for a ""strong"" female character in the old, Depression-era cinema, Francis's Colet is a real doozy.  Fine supporting roles by Everett Edward Norton, C. Aubrey Smith and Charles Ruggles as well.  It may take you a little while to settle into this film's cheerfully salacious wavelength, but once you get into it, it pays off handsomely.  A nice, fun movie.",1080864000,4,1186,5.01530612244898
1806452,5,B00007CVS4,"Lubitsch's films are often described as ""sophisticated,"" or the height of Continental elegance, but in many ways they're nothing of the sort.  Remember that Lubitsch, though European, was no highbrow; he started as a slapstick comedian in German silents, and as a director, he kept a slapstick comic's ability to mock the pretentions of supposedly ""sophisticated"" people.  Part of the appeal of a Lubitsch film is the way it combines well-mannered Continental characters with a comic sensibility that is not at all well-mannered.  The actor deliver their lines with a stylized flair, but the lines themselves have the ring of the best of Broadway comedy (Lubitsch's writer, Samson Raphaelson, was imported from Broadway, and was most famous for writing play on which THE JAZZ SINGER was based).  The characters try to act elegant and civilized, but Lubitsch undercuts their pretensions: The first shot of ""exotic"" Venice is of a singing garbageman; the ""Baron"" and ""Countess"" of the opening scenes turn out to be impostors; the world of the wealthy Mme. Colet is one of thieves and fools.  The underlying sensibility is very American, and oddly close to that of a Marx Brothers movie -- the ""lowbrow"" crooks unmask the affectations of high society and prove to have more of a moral code than most of the ""sophisticated"" rich people they prey upon.  The only sympathetic rich character is Mme. Colet (Kay Francis), who is sympathetic precisely because she has few pretentions.  And like so many of Lubitsch's heroine, she secretly dunks donuts.
Samson Raphaelson's dialogue is some of the best ever written for the screen: He can get more laughs with the single word ""tonsils"" than most screenwriters can get in a whole comedy script.  The film is also notable for Lubitsch's use of sound and music: Lubitsch was one of the first filmmakers to show how effectively sound could be used to suggest things that were happening offscreen, and the music score actually follows the actors' movements, like a silent film score (people doing scores for silent movies should study this film to get an understanding of what great silent filmmakers like Lubitsch expected music to do in otherwise silent scenes).  This has always been one of my favorite movies, and it deserves its reputation as a masterpiece of comedy.
The print used for this DVD is not perfect -- a bit too dark in the opening scenes -- but it'll do, and it comes with the usual excellent Criterion bonuses, including a German silent film by Lubitsch (with a score that is serviceable but not really appropriate -- since the film is based on Johann Strauss's DIE FLEDERMAUS, shouldn't the score use music from Strauss's operetta?).  Be sure to get the other Lubitsch/Raphaelson film available in the DVD format, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, and hope for a release of their last masterpiece, HEAVEN CAN WAIT.",1072656000,10,2863,4.97071129707113
1806453,5,B00007CVS4,"""Trouble in Paradise""... I had read sooooo much about this classic Lubitsch comedy, that I was afraid I would be disappointed upon watching, at last, this long awaited film, as it has happened to me many times before,..... well, I wasn't , it lived up to my expectations, A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y.
We, ordinary people from this era, are not used to such delightful, delicate, sophisticated, witty and subtle screenplays & motion pictures. This film's pacing is perfect, the acting deft, the fun and enjoyment non-stop, Travis Banton's costumes are fabulous, the art-dco settings and the dcors are top of the tops, and finally, the cast, an A++.
Herbert Marshall has never been so ""bewildered"" on the screen (so different from those dull characters he played, for example, in such films as those two landamark Bette Davis' melodramas of the early forties, ""The Letter"" and ""The Little Foxes"") as suave and elegant thief Gaston Monescu. Kay Francis (Mariette Colet) has never been so attractive, elegant, as a woman daringly, shamelessly, passionately and madly in love with debonair Marshall, and last but not least, Miriam Hopkins (Lily) was never so charming and beguilingly captivating, as Marshall's partner in crime and love. I will say no more -no spoilers here-, that's all you need to know before watching it.
Edward Everett Horton, Charlie Ruggles (as Francis' two feuding suitors) and C. Aubrey Smith (as the chairman to the board of directors of Francis' company), add expert supporting playing.
Beautifully photographed in black & white, one can easily understand why this motion picture is included in the top ten list of the best american films of all time, as the grandest example of the famed Lubitsch touch.

1806454,5,B00007CVS4,"""Perfect"" is an adjective not applicable to many films, but this is one of them. Lubitsch and Raphaelson pare down sex, wit, greed, and romance to their essences. There are no preachy moral or political messages here, no slapstick or toilet humor aimed at the lowest common denominator. L & R never talk down to their audience. They set the bar of wit, subtlety, and sophistication very high and respect us -- the audience -- enough to assume it isn't *too* high for us to get it.  That means some will *not* get it, of course, as the disgruntled one-star reviewers here show. Perhaps a ""dumb and dumber"" diet of Jim Carrey and American Pie-type movies has blinded them to real wit, humor, and acute observation of the human condition. For the rest of us, this is a smart, humane comedy that presumes its audience is smart and humane -- I can't think of a single movie comedy of the past decade you could say that about.  TIP reminds us all how much better and smarter comedy could be if today's filmmakers had even a fraction of L&R's craft, class, wit, and intelligence.
