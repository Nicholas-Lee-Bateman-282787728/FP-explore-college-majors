8198046,2,B000QX7X7O,First off I'll say right up front I can't speak Russian and there's no subtitles but they have to remove that picture because there's precious little sniping at all. In my opinion the producers threw away a golden opportunity 28 minutes into the movie and the very ending should have been inserted at 40 minutes and then built on. This could have been a great look at the female Soviet sniper but since I can't understand Russian I don't know if that was the aim of the producers. Also when I bought it I didn't know it was a 4 part tv series.,1285891200,2,543,4.281553398058253
