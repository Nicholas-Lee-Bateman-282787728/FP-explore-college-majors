8736270,3,B016CKKNCQ,"I so awaited the release of this film.  I am always looking for Spanish-language films that present history from a different narrative.
While this film provides much information in a dramatic format, it will be impossible for most viewers to appreciate without a very clear understanding of the history it attempts to portray.  The story is an important story, but this film does not have the qualities needed to reach a wider audience and therefore inform them of the atrocities that occurred in South America during these years of horrific oppression.",1450396800,4,553,5.065934065934066
8736271,5,B016CKKNCQ,"Certainly the most UNFORGETABLE film of this year's Chicago Latino Film Festival.

A BOLIVIAN historical drama about the 1970s-80s Cold War era ""Operation Condor"" in which the militaries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay -- its officers having trained at the U.S. ""School of the Americas"" -- WORKED TOGETHER to abduct, torture and DISAPPEAR as many as 60,000 suspected leftists across southern South America thereby CRUSHING an ALSO certainly _coordinated_ multinational Communist insurgency across their lands. BUT AT WHAT COST? A tremendous and again UTTERLY UNFORGETABLE FILM -- http://frdennismoviereviews.blogspot.com/2015/04/forgotten-orig-olvidados-2014.html",1449619200,3,690,6.582417582417582
