The plot is just froth: the old comic device of a race for treasure between rival groups of thieves.  In this case the treasure is a securely locked train car bearing ten billion rupees ($220 million U.S.) in freshly printed banknotes. An international gang led by a homicidal maniac straight out of a James Bond film (convincingly played by Salim Ghouse) has stolen this train car, but then lost track of it, and is now one of the two groups of thieves chasing after it.

The other group is two young rural ne'er-do-wells, an Indian Bret-and-Bart-Maverick pair, engagingly played by Prashanth and Anand.  Along the way these two young men pick up female allies (sort of):  a middle-class country girl (played by Heera Rajgopal) who had been just about to kill herself rather than be forced into marriage, and a glamorous dancer (played by Anu Agarval) who is on the lam from the murderous international gang.

There are fist-fights galore, and some blood.  But like so many Indian stories, and unlike most similar films from Hollywood, this tale is driven not by suspense but by the playing-out of karma.  And so, as in any good fairy tale, the blood is limited, the fisticuffs unlikely, and each character ends with exactly what she or he deserves.

And along the way, the film is filled with the joy of life.  The actors *become* their parts, each radiant with her or his own personality.  The cinematography glows with the beauties of the Indian countryside.  The movie revels in the comic possibilities of cops-and-robbers car chases, especially as they would have to play out in rural India.  All the fights are satisfying.  And the movie shamelessly stoops to sequences that could never happen in real life, inviting the viewer to laugh at each impossibility in turn.

So it's all good fun.  But what makes it more than that -- and makes the film worth going out of your way to see -- is that it was one of the first of the great collaborations between producer-director Mani Ratnam and composer A. R. Rahman.  I'm totally seduced by three musical interludes in the film's second half, in which this partnership shines.  First is the breathtaking *pas de deux* ""Thee Thee"":  four and a half minutes of beauty enough to stop time.  Then we get ""Putham Pudu Boomi"", a giddy rhapsody about the feelings of the young thieves and the glamorous defector upon getting hold of the money.  And finally we have the younger thief's song of parting to the country girl, ""Rasathi Rasathi"", which draws, startlingly but with great power, on the sort of rich South African harmony that Ladysmith Black Mambazo made world-famous.

These gems are enough to make the DVD a keeper.  And as I write this, it has just returned to availability after a very long absence.  It probably won't stay available for long.  Go, get it while you can.",1268870400,,2948,4.720156555772994
