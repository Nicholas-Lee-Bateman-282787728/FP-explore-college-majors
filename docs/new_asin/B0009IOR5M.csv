2292922,5,B0009IOR5M,"I love this movie from top to bottom, probably one of the greatest of all time.  This definetly represents the peak of Steve Martin's career.  That being said the format of this disc is terrible, very few extras and it's Pan and Scan.  Overall it's worth it but could actually improve more.  ""This guy put the old pizza in a cup guy out of business""",1127174400,2,349,4.323076923076923
2292923,2,B0009IOR5M,Another anniversary issue of a beyond classic film and Universal just takes a dump on the consumer. Marginally better transfer and few extras. We deserve better Universal....so shame on you.,1125100800,7,190,5.366666666666666
2292924,3,B0009IOR5M,"Figured I might as well throw in my two cents, even though other have already pointed out the shortcomings of this latest release of a true comedy classic, ""The Jerk.""

I guess Universal called this an ""Anniversary"" edition, rather than a ""Special"" edition, because technically there isn't anything all that special about it.  Not even the scenes that were included in the network TV version are to be found as ""deleted scenes"" (I'd personally rather not have them at all then to have the re-inserted into the movie, as some have complained about).  Let's just face it, the ""extras"" here are worthless pieces of junk.  The ukelele play-along wouldn't be so annoying if it were surrounded by some solid supplements (it would remain utterly pointless).

Probably even more worthless than the play-along thing, is the so-called ""Lost Filmstrips of Carlos Las Vegas De Cordova.""  Some web critics have been duped into thinking that this is actually footage from the original production.  It's not.  This is some clown's version of fan fiction.  This ""lost"" footage was quite obviously newly created specifically to be a supplement for this dvd, shot on video and treated to look sort of like old black and white film.  The guy who's supposed to be Steve Martin shouldn't fool anyone.  This thing is beyond words, it's so ridiculous.

Much has been made of this being the first time ""The Jerk"" has been presented in widescreen since it's theatrical run.  I'm all in favor of preserving the original aspect ratio, and I was initially very glad to know this would be finally getting that treatment.  The truth is, not much if anything is really ehanced to the viewing experience of this movie by it being in 1.85:1.  In fact, I was so used to the full-frame presentation on the previous disc, that I was distracted by the loss of at least one gag - a victim of the widescreen framing.  Well, maybe loss is going too far - but let's say the obstructed-view of at least one gag.  I'm referring specifically to the scene where Jackie Mason, at the gas station right before his wife gets out of the car, uses a series of hand signals to communicate to Navin (the subject is Mason's love life).  Those who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about, as Navin cluelessly mimics the series of hand motions.  It's always been a hilarious moment, though the widescreen presentation does actually work against this particular scene as Mason's hand signals go mostly unseen.  It's hard to believe the scene was presented this way in theaters.  Anyway, that may seem like nit-picking, but it was nonetheless dissapointing for me - a fan of every last detail in this movie.",1123632000,4,2658,4.772428884026258
2292925,5,B0009IOR5M,"Surreal to the point of silliness, ""The Jerk"" captured the atmosphere of comedy perfectly in the 70's. Before Robin Williams broke through to a larger audience on the big and little screen, Steve Martin was THE JERK. As dense as a brick, Martin doesn't so much as act like a jerk as become one. Opening like a variation on all those Hollywood tales where the hero of our story is down on his luck but soon to be redeemed (of course, this IS a comedy so it's unlikely he'll get the redemption we expect because, well, that wouldn't be funny),  Navin Johnson (Martin) mentions at the beginning that he was ""born a poor black child"". Adopted by a poor African-American family living in poverty, Navin is horrified to discover that not only is he adopted but he's always going to be Caucasian and have absolutely no rhythm. Navin discovers he does have rhythm after all (""praise the Lord!"") when he listens to a radio playing dance music from the time. Navin eats his Twinkies, learns the difference between sh-t and Shinola and hits the road hoping to be rich. Armed with the advice his family gives him (""God bless the working man...and remember never trust whitey!""). He hitchhikes getting his first ride which takes him to the end of a fence getting about twenty feet away from home. Needless to say, life is more than an adventure for Nathan and his dog Shithead; it's a vocation.

Receiving a very nice transfer, ""The Jerk"" looks typical of a film from the late 70's with noticeable film grain and while the colors aren't quite as vivid as I would have thought, they're acceptable. This is the first widescreen presentation for the film so that's something to be thankful for. There's quite a bit of analog debris in the form of dirt (in fact it looks as if this is exactly the same transfer as the previous edition). The 5.1 remastered Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix has nice presence but (not surprisingly) it doesn't use the format particularly well.

 In addition to the original production notes from the previous edition and theatrical trailer we also get 1 extra and 1 featuring footage cut from the film. ""The Lost Filmstrips of Father Carlos Las Vegas De Cordova"" is a ""continuation"" of the film within a film where we see Martin play various characters doing things like verbally abusing a plant, dressing a bulldog in a clown suit as the audience cheers and takes pets in a bizarre parody of cock fighting. It's really footage that was cut from that sequence. ""Learn to Play `Tonight You Belong to Me'"" includes sections where you can learn to tune a ukulele (something I've been dying to learn), play it, play along with the Ukulele Gal and, finally, play along with the jerk himself. It's bizarre to say the least. The last bit is just a scene from ""The Jerk"" where Navin serenades his sweetheart at the beach.

No commentary track from Martin or Reiner. Honestly, you'd think they were embarrassed by this film! Or, maybe they weren't asked to do it or wanted too much money. While an improvement on the original edition of the film, that improved is slight at best. The featurettes are pleasant diversions but the real reason to get ""The Jerk"" is that this is the first time it's been presented in widescreen. The image quality could have been cleaned up quite a bitas there's quite a bit of analog debris that appears early on in the film. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this unless you're dying to have the widescreen version of this classic comedy.",1123113600,65,3472,4.666666666666667
2292926,3,B0009IOR5M,"For such a classic, highly regarded comedy the lack of and inferior quality of the extras is a crime.

First up is a step-by-step instructional video on how to play ""Tonight You Belong to Me"" on the ukulele. While it is kinda cool to be able to follow all the notes and spots on the guitar that you need to know, this extra feels inconsequential even for The Jerk.

Perhaps the most disappointing extra is ""The Lost Film Strips of Father Carlos Las Vegas de Cordova,"" which attempts (badly) to recreate the grainy bootleg film that appears in the movie but continues on with someone who doesn't even resemble Martin!

Things improve slightly with a vintage (and very funny) theatrical trailer.

In lieu of a Making Of featurette there are production notes that include lots of interesting factoids and quotes from Martin and director Carl Reiner who recount anecdotes of filming The Jerk.

What the...?! Were these extras put together by Navin himself? Nah, they would've been funnier. You know the extras stink when the best thing is the trailer. Simply dreadful.",1123113600,3,1064,4.824175824175824
2292927,2,B0009IOR5M,"Carl Reiner and Stever Martin created one of the funniest movies of all time in The Jerk.  Universal has created one of the worst ""anniversay editions"" ever released on DVD.  While the movie does get the widescreen treatment and the packaging claims that the sound has been remastered, the ""extras"" on this DVD are so LAME I don't even know where to begin.  Why is there no featurette, no commentary track, no deleted scenes, no cast interviews?????  Instead we get NOTHING!!!  While I haven't seen the original DVD release of this movie, the picture and sound on this 26th Anniversary edition are average at best.  The only extras of any merit are the trailer and some production notes.....that's it.  The other two are the most ignorant things I've ever seen to pass for DVD extra features.  The movie itself scores a 5 with me, but if you already own a copy of this on DVD, the only reason you have to upgrade is the widescreen treatment.  Other than that just stick with the original copy.",1122595200,6,993,4.628571428571429
2292928,4,B0009IOR5M,"This is a classic comedy film, well worth having around.  But you should be aware the older DVD edition is full frame 1:33:1.  That means it shows almost the whole picture that was originally shot by the cameras.  The newer, widescreen edition shows just a little more of the frame on the left and right, but you can see much more of the top and bottom on the previous, full frame DVD.  This new edition does have better picture and sound, and the size of the picture should match the theatrical presentation more closely than the full frame DVD.  So whichever framing you think is more authentic is up to you.",1122422400,4,610,4.45945945945946
2292929,5,B0009IOR5M,"Okay, instantly this is The Jerk. That alone rates 5 stars. Easily the funniest movie ever made. The one I've based far too much of my life on. Anyhow when you watch the TV version, as I did several times growing up, you see a man come to Navin Johnson asking for money to fix the cracked leather seats on his private airplane. Great, funny scene. Years later I bought the VHS copy, this scene is missing. What the? More stuff in the TV-edited-for-commercial-content version? that doesn't seem to make sense. Also on the ""TV"" version when Navin first breaks up with Marie, he goes on the tilt-a-whirl for hours. He comes back down and talks about reeling through every emotion up there. Navin tries to name his emotions with the help of his fellow carnies, who are the type of guys who have no emotion. Anyhow again, on TV, not the VHS. That just isn't right. Do these extras, that really shouldn't be extras, make the cut to this ""special"" edition DVD? If so I'll buy, if not, well I'll still probably buy, but I only want to pay One dollar and NINE CENTS!!!!!",1122163200,12,1061,4.446153846153846

2293059,5,B0009IOR5M,"The Jerk was a brilliantly written comedy starring Steve Martin and a cast of zany supporting characters.  Bernadette Peters plays his girlfriend in a perfect acting turn.
The plot has Steve Martin as a dull white guy somehow raised by a wonderful, loving, but poor rural black family.  He's unbelievably naive, not to say 'dim'.  He moves to the big city, is taken advantage of by everyone, but somehow makes a fortune.  He then loses a fortune due to a liability lawsuit and is on skidrow. What happens at the end is for you to discover.
The twists and turns of the film have Steve Martin encountering some eccentric people who all try and fleece him as a 'rube'.  Jackie Mason plays his boss at a gas station and is great.  Martin encounters the 'mob', gang punks, and others in a series of 'sketches' where you are constantly surprised by the humor derived from those odd moments.
The Jerk is never mentioned when a listing of the great comedies of all-time is discussed, but it should be.  Please get it and see for yourself...",1417132800,,1032,4.576086956521739

Oh, it was still funny but just not the ""hilarious"" movie I always remembered it as. Maybe its reputation and memory exceeded its value, or maybe it's funnier when you are younger.  The movie didn't change; I must have.

Whatever, there is still a lot of good laughs in year, subtle and slapstick variety. Now I laugh more at the subtle things. Almost all the characters in here, beginning with Steve Martin's ""Navin R. Johnson,"" are totally wacky. Bernadette Peters, by the way, never looked prettier.

 This was in the earlier days of the ratings system and that PG rating would be at least PG-13 today. It still fun to see it after a long absence. Martin was on a roll back in those days, ""a wild and crazy guy,"" and it's good that he's still entertaining us 30 years later, although in a more subtle way.

2293135,4,B0009IOR5M,"`The Jerk' is one of those comedies that is talked about by just about everyone; one of those comedies you feel almost incomplete if you haven't seen since everyone else around you has seen it and is always talking about it.  Well, that's at least how it was with me until like a week ago when I finally got around to watching it.

The film tells the story of Navin Johnson, a white man who was raised by blacks.  After finding his rhythm he decides to leave home and spread his wings.  He picks up a slew of odd jobs here and there before joining the circus and meeting the girl of his dreams and then accidentally making millions when he creates an odd invention that proves to be a hit.  After making his money and squandering most of it he finds himself destitute and alone, yet again.

Like the tagline suggests; this is a rags to riches, to rags kind of story.

The script is actually really well written because it manages to be funny almost all of the time.  There are a few scenes that don't quite work too well, but the films short running time also helps with keeping the pace brisk and so the film really doesn't have time to meander on the weak jokes; they just move right along to the ones that work.  Steve Martin (in his film starring debut) is a comedian whom we all have come to know and love and respect, and this may very well be his finest hour.  He is utterly hysterical, and he actually manages to bring a shade of humane naivety to his characters senseless acts.  We actually really like this guy regardless of how stupid he is.

Martin is helped out by a large and impressive cast, everyone from Bernadette Peters to Catlin Adams to M. Emmet Walsh showing up to raise the roof.  Walsh has a hilarious role here as the madman who randomly picks Navin's name from a phonebook and plans to murder him.  The scene alone may be the best scene in the film and is well worth the cost of the DVD.

Truth be told, this is not everyone's cup of tea or type of humor.  This is far more slapstick than intelligent, but I think you would know that already.  If you are more into the mature comedies then this may not be for you, but if you can appreciate a good `over-the-top' laugh riot then this is a film you're going to want to see.  You're bound to find a laugh somewhere, whether it's from the name of Navin's dog or from the discovery of Navin's `special purpose'; this movie is designed to tickle that funny bone.",1225843200,,2433,4.286652078774617

Steve Martin is at the peak of his comedic form here, playing Navin Johnson, who is so stupid he doesn't even realize he's not a black person.  Bernadette Peters gets to show off her vocal skills and comedic talent too, as Navin's lover, Marie.
Navin goes through a period of his life working at a gas station, then at a carnival, accidentally makes a fortune, then loses it all when the product that made him rich starts causing serious problems.

I don't necessarily buy for the extras, which didn't come with my early generation wide-screen version of ""The Jerk,"" one of those movies that never gets old. That applies only to the unedited version of course. The successful formula for this movie has been imitated, but never duplicated. Martin was at his comedic peak when this movie came out, and that's obvious throughout The Jerk. And perhaps my favorite female celebrity (yeah, yeah. I get lots of slack for that) of all time, Bernadette Peters plays Martin's love interest, perfectly setting up Martin's unique sense of humor throughout the movie. There are times I merely scroll through the movie just to watch her scenes. Complete infatuation. The whole ensemble in this movie is perfectly cast, as they deliver regardless of amount of camera time. The funniest scenes are gutbusters, many of them embedded in pop culture history. I lost count of how many times we quoted scenes from this movie whenever the opportunity presented itself, often in a drunken delight I'll admit. There's never a moment in this movie where you didn't drink your beverage carefully for fear of spitting it out in sudden subtle, or explicit hilarious moment, and many of those moments have aged well. It's shame Martin has become so reluctant to doing comedic material and given us more paternal roles as years haver rolled by, though it's understandable that he'd stretch himself out. And to be fair, Martin comedies that followed were hit and miss for the most part. They all paled by comparison to the gold standard set by The Jerk. And if that's all you're asking from you're DVD, you'll be more than happy.

In this film, back in 1979, she's is just as cute as she can possibly be!

Watch for director Carl Reiner's cameo in the film. :)

The DVD calls itself an anniversary edition, as others here have noted, but it's very, very stingy with extras. At least the transfer and sound have been cleaned up, but there isn't much else. It's really disappointing not to have more deleted scenes. During the 80s (and beyond), when the film was broadcast on television, it came with several additional scenes, restored to the film to make up for other cuts (for content), but these aren't included in the DVD.

2293153,2,B0009IOR5M,"This is one of my favorite comedies.  It's not for everyone, as you must understand Martin's unique style of humor.  That having been said, the DVD is awful.

The transfer is decent, although could have been cleaned up more.  Luckily, it's at least anamorphic widescreen.  The sound, while hardly sounding like 5.1, still sounds decent, as i doubt surround sound was on the mind of film makers in 1979.  Seriously, it's not Star Wars.

Extras?  Fugetaboudit!  NO commentary.  NO making-of.  NO interviews.  Just one delected scene, trailer, and a dumb ukelele lesson.

The WORST part!  There are scenes missing!  Perhaps this version of the film is exactly as it was released in the theaters, but i'm too young to know.  However, every time i've seen it on television, there were scenes not present in this release...such as the several different people requesting donations from the rich Navin Johnson.  In this, you only get the Mexican priest.  Where's the guy who needs new seat covers on his plane?  That scene was classic!

You know, this is the SECOND release of this film on DVD, and they call it an ""Anniversary Edition.""  If they're going to give it a name like that, they could at least include the cut of the movie with extra scenes added back in.  Maybe the commentary and a simple 15-minute making-of is asking too much, but at least give us the material that's already in the can.",1159660800,152,1395,4.725
2293154,4,B0009IOR5M,"Navin Johnson is an idiot. He was adopted and raised by black sharecroppers in Mississippi. Navin loves his family but he feels he doesn't fit in. His family all has rhythm, but he doesn't. So, on his 18th birthday he leaves to discover the rest of the world. After hitching a few rides he ends up in St. Louis working and living at a gas station. My favorite scene in the entire movie happens there. The new phone books arrive and Navin gets all excited. ""This is the kind of spontaneous publicity--your name in print--that makes people. I'm in print! Things are going to start happening to me now."" That scene is priceless. While at the gas station Navin invents a device for a man's glasses that later makes Navin a billionaire. But, before that happens he gets shot at by a crazy sharpshooter, gets a job at a traveling carnival, meets a biker chick, breaks up with the biker chick, and fall in love and marry the woman of his dreams, Marie Kimble (Bernadette Peters). Of course, Navin ends up losing everything and that's why he's a jerk.

THE JERK wasn't Steve Martin's first movie, but it was his first starring role in a feature film and introduced the style of comedy he was doing on the comedy circuit to a broader audience. The movie is filled with all kinds of jokes from witty one-liners, poop jokes, sexual innuendo, slapstick, and a lot of crazy nonsense.

There were moments of THE JERK that I really enjoyed, but there was a lot of stuff that was just plain stupid. Of course, there's a lot of material in the film that no one would be able to get away with today. Steve Martin always was more than just a ""Wild and Crazy Guy."" He's an intellectual at heart and one can see snippets of that side of Martin in THE JERK. Unfortunately, it's overshadowed by the type of comedy Martin was doing on the comedy circuit that appealed mainly to teenagers and college students. Actually, the reason I ended up liking THE JERK wasn't because of Martin at all, it was because of Bernadette Peters. Peters is one of the finest actresses of all time--she can do serious drama or slapstick comedy and do it better than any other actress. She's a classy lady with a broad charm. Martin is the star of THE JERK, but the film would not have been able to stand if it wasn't for Peters.

THE JERK is a must-see movie for Martin or Peters fans. It's also a movie that people who enjoy lowbrow humor will probably like. The film's largest audience at the time it was released was college students and teenagers. Twenty-five years that core audience probably hasn't changed much.",1159056000,2,2574,4.507494646680942

I'm a believer now, completely.  There were so many great scenes.  Bernadette Peters was absolutely wonderful.  The plot was so silly and unbelievable that it made perfect sense in a bizarre sort of way.

2293168,4,B0009IOR5M,"This is a great DVD on how to play ""Tonight You Belong To Me"" with a Ukulele!  With lots of practice and this great program, after a relatively short time, I was able to play ""Tonight You Belong To Me"" on my Ukulele!

However, the special bonus features leave a lot to be desired.  One lame extra was a movie about some jerk just because the song ""Tonight You Belong to Me"" was played on a Ukulele in it.",1130803200,7,404,4.0886075949367084
2293169,5,B0009IOR5M,"Steve Martin created several loveable offbeat characters in the late '70s.  This is one of them.  Now he's writing for the New Yorker and composing novels.  Go figure.  He's smart, he's funny, and he's King Tut.

This is a great comedic movie and it receives proper treatment in this release.  If you can't figure out why some people hate cans of oil, this is the DVD for you.",1129248000,2,376,4.455882352941177
2293170,5,B0009IOR5M,"Laughed like crazy the first time I saw it and still laugh each time I see it again.  I let my grandkids watch it too.  A couple scenes are a bit racy for their age group but what the heck! (6-8-9)

Steve Martin is a natural born comic, I think.  If you don't like him, you won't like the movie.",1127952000,3,295,3.8666666666666667
