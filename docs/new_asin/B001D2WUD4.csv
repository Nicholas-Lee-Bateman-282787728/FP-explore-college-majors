3523400,3,B001D2WUD4,"I agree with most of the posts here - I am happy to have purchased this just for DVD 1 so I could get the rest of the first season, very funny episodes there and just as good as all the episodes from the first DVD set. The series went down hard in season two though. Penetration Island really shows this, as they for some reason used gratuitous violence that just seemed very out of place and ruined the sense of light-heardedness that was a key component of the show. The other episodes from season two are just as bad; they easily slipped into simply re-using funny characters and parts from Season 1, losing the creativity and originality that made the first season so funny. You can tell the life was somehow gone from the series. The Porcelain Bidet character introduced in season 2 had zero chemistry with the cast, they should've continued with Prof Milosevic instead, who DID seem to fit in quite well with the cast towards the end of season 1 (again, great reason to buy this set since he is only on the season 1 episodes available in this set).",1434153600,,1054,4.438144329896907

3523434,5,B001D2WUD4,"The first original series from FX! Produced by the great Howard Stern!!!!!!

Why can't we just say a quick note about the product we bought? Amazon makes it too time consuming and they probably wonder why so many people don't review their items!",1367020800,,245,4.6976744186046515
3523435,1,B001D2WUD4,"The first set of son of the are great. There was some indication from the reviews that this second set stunk but how bad could it be?  In sitcoms there is often a decline from the best seasons but this is insane. I could not make it through the series. Did not laugh once, and I am afraid as much as I liked the first series that I will never look at Johnson the same way again. I could not believe how bad this was.",1364860800,2,416,3.8941176470588235

3523486,5,B001D2WUD4,"Oh man, I wish Son of the Beach was still going! I am a Howard Stern fan, so I was instantly attracted to the show, but even after his creative input trickled down, the episodes were still hilarious and hugely enjoyable (if not exactly suited for the entire family.)",1361145600,,266,4.448979591836735

3523488,5,B001D2WUD4,I recieved the item super fast and was packed very carefully. Excellent item. I bought this set in hopes of getting a good laugh like I did when they aired on tv.,1354665600,,162,4.09375

The quality is just a little grainy, but I've been watching alot of HD, and these are not HD. But they look great. I could not find this in any store. A great show & fun to watch, enjoy.",1277942400,,274,4.0
3523494,4,B001D2WUD4,"This show was one that you either liked or loathed.  I liked its combination of dazzling dames, corny humor, ridiculously unlikely plots, and ""over the top"" acting.  I specifically got this season because Amy Webber was in it.  An incredible brunette, she didn't have to act too much...the bikini did most of the work.  Together with the dour blonde who was in all seasons of the show, the muscleman, and of course Tim Stack and the black actress, this little troupe carried off the show.  Yes, the show, on its face, was a spoof of Baywatch, pure and simple.  However, Baywatch never had any of the convoluted plots that this comedy series had...they were more like spoofs of Bond films than anything else.

The show was silliness personified...and I loved it.",1274486400,2,761,4.763358778625954
3523525,4,B001D2WUD4,This show at time pretty dumb but at the same time it has some funny and campy moments..still like to watch it..,1265760000,,112,4.136363636363637
3523526,5,B001D2WUD4,ot as popular as the first season but still ok. Amy Weber is the main reaosn i got it. Sometimes I wonder how this show ever mad eit into basic cable haha but it was on during a time where poliical correctness didn't exist,1265241600,,222,4.068181818181818
3523527,5,B001D2WUD4,fun as all hell,1264809600,,15,3.0
3523528,3,B001D2WUD4,"My husband and I both LOVED the first volume. The first disc on Volume 2 carries on the same humor as Volume 1, but after that, it's pretty much downhill. Anita Massengil is gone, and the Porcelain Bidet character that is added to the team is an absolute flop. We are also suddenly and without explanation introduced to a pregnant BJ Cummings, which REALLY throws the humor and flow of the show off. Alas, the true Son of the Beach fan will still find the wisecracks and puns amusing even through the worse episodes. If anything, it's worth getting to complete the show and it's definitely worth it for the rest of Season 2.",1252713600,8,624,4.482456140350878
3523529,1,B001D2WUD4,"For those of us who've waited anxiously for Vol. 2 to finally appear, this is a sour disappointment. The jokes and scenarios are more contrived, and it feels like the cast members just didn't have their hearts in it anymore. The guest stars are more high-profile than in Vol. 1, but their appearances contribute little to the episodes.

Additionally, Mayor Massengil and her son are gone, and a new (and unfunny) female lifeguard is added to the SPF crew.

It's almost as if all the show's writers were replaced during season two (which is split between Vol. 1 and Vol. 2). Most of these episodes spoof well-known shows or movies, like The Matrix, Survivor, and James Bond -- but they try too hard and the spoofs run on too long.

There are a handful of laughs in this volume, but none of the belly laughs of the first volume. Those of us who crave the gut-busting hilarity of Vol. 1 will just have to settle for re-watching those classic episodes.",1240790400,2,948,4.564705882352941
3523530,3,B001D2WUD4,"Classic Notch.  Not quite as funny in my opinion as Volume 1, but there are a couple of good ones on this...plus this Volume 2 was released by a completely different group than Volume 1.",1232323200,,186,4.314285714285714
3523531,4,B001D2WUD4,"This volume is good for one thing: the rest of season 2.  Apparently they knew they were being cancelled and didn't care about season 3 and just tried really hard to blow as much of the budget as possible ( plus the b.j. cummings character is pregnant and that throws off the original dynamic that makes the show hilarious).  So, if you are a true fan, buy it, it contains the rest of season 2 which you need and is great.  Season 3 can hit the dumpster though.",1229385600,14,461,4.215909090909091
3523532,5,B001D2WUD4,"We've waited 5 years to get some Johnson.  The wait was worth it.  The second greatest comedy series in the lowbrow category has arrived and is as funny as ever.  Notch and his unit bring glory to Malibu Adjacent.
Notch Johnson goes down as a classic in the tradition of Al Bundy.",1229040000,3,280,4.346153846153846
3523533,4,B001D2WUD4,"Go back to the beach for another heavy dose of mindless entertainment and skimpy eye-candy in ""Son of the Beach: Volume Two"". World famous lifeguard Notch Johnson (Tim Stack) and his well-endowed unit SPF-30 (Jaime Bergman, Leila Arcieri, Kim Oja & Roland Kickinger) protect the sunny beaches of Malibu Adjacent from every day dangers. From executive producer Howard Stern and star Tim Stack, ""Son of the Beach"" is the side-splitting and raunchy parody of ""Baywatch"". The half-hour comedy series premiered on the FX Network in the spring of 2000 and ran for three seasons. Due to its crude humor and politically incorrect jokes, ""Son of the Beach"" isn't for everyone. Its ridiculous storylines and silly acting won't win any awards, but the comedy series does offer an abundance of bawdy sex jokes, obvious genre stereotypes, movie parodies and great low-brow humor. As bumbling life guard Notch Johnson, Tim Stack is very funny and manages to keep the series afloat. These final episodes of ""Son of the Beach"" feature guest appearances by Jason Alexander, Mark Hamill, Alan Thicke, Vincent Pastore, David Arquette, Adam Corolla, Bill Maher and Gilbert Gottfried.

After 5 years, the final episodes of the FX Network comedy series have finally arrived on DVD in a fine 3-disc set. The presentation of ""Son of the Beach: Volume 2"" is very similar to the first volume set. All 21 episodes of the second half of Season Two and all of Season Three are presented in their original full screen format. Despite some noticeable grain, the picture quality is good. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is rather satisfactory. The special features in this 3-disc set include DVD menu introductions with series star Tim Stack, audio commentaries by the series creators on eight episodes, 17 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage, cast audition tapes, promos, three sexy montage highlights and a table read of the show's pilot. Overall, ""Son of the Beach: Volume 2"" gets a ""B"".",1226448000,6,1955,5.052631578947368
3523534,5,B001D2WUD4,"...that this would be like other shows that have suffered from partial release due to poor sales or whatever. I'm very excited that this is finally being released. I've practically worn out Vol. 1 both by watching it myself, and by showing it to friends who somehow missed it when it was on TV. So far everyone's loved it. Pure mindless fun.",1223769600,,341,4.516129032258065

A cut out is a promotional copy that is not to be for sale because royalties to the rights owner aren't paid.  HOWARD STERN FRIENDS, THE SELLER IS NOT PAYING HOWARD HIS ROYALTY FOR THIS SALE.

Don't misunderstand me, the show is a blast, and lots of fun!  This isn't a complaint in any way against the show, just this seller.
