8524358,4,B00838N3AK,"Alex (Michelle Argyris) is going to school and rooms with two other girls: Jessica (Shantelle Canzanese) who is like her BFF and Bree (Vanessa Broze) who is her frenemy. Unknown to Alex, her and Bree share her boyfriend Brian (Kevin Jake Walker) because Alex is still a ""pure vessel.""

One night after some parting, Alex and Jessica visit a gypsy (Louise Hollingsworth). After this episode the film turns in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Exorcist"", and ""The Entity"" which you can pretty much tell by the two titles for the film:The Devil in Me"" and ""The Devil's Seed."" Guess who the kid is.

The film has a good build up and creep factor. It is far superior  to ""Devil's Due"" a film of similar topic. Worth a view for horror fans even if you know what is coming.
