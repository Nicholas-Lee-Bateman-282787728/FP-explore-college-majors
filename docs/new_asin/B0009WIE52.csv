2327279,5,B0009WIE52,"This show was adorable, especially the second part about how children deal with their differences. Seeing the things that they go through every day is amazing. It's sad and heartwarming all at the same time. As an 18 year old, I watched this with my 47 year old mother. We both loved it. She has shown it to all her friends. Everyone loves it. I would recommend that everyone see this, at any age.",1299110400,,397,4.378378378378378
2327280,5,B0009WIE52,"She doesn't care for the cartoons...as with any other cartoon show. She loves to see the children and hear them talk. I think this is a great video for very young children to teach them EARLY about being different in many ways AND accepting all our differences.

The video is NOT long so know that it's only 30 minutes long.",1298505600,,324,4.4
2327281,5,B0009WIE52,"I just watched this video on HBO and I loved it! It covered all types of children and circumstances that children experience in school. It had a child who was blind, one who had braces on his legs, and another who was a little person. This video also read aloud children's books that shared other differences people have that make us special. I plan on using this video the first week of school to set the tone in my classroom. This video shows kids and how they feel when kids aren't sensitive. It also shows what's great about everyone no mater what challenges they may have.",1281657600,,577,4.452830188679245
2327282,5,B0009WIE52,This video is very well done. I think every child should see it and adult too.,1255910400,,78,3.9375
2327283,5,B0009WIE52,Everyone should see these videos...They are wonderful.  I love the perspective that the video take about ability awareness!,1243641600,3,123,5.833333333333333
2327284,5,B0009WIE52,"My husband and I recorded this show from HBO on a whim, hoping it might interest our 2 year old.  Well, all of us love it!  My husband, myself, my 2 year old and my 13 month old.  The show is filled with wonderful stories narrated by well known celebrities, as well as commentary from children.  It almost reminds me of ""Kids Say the Darndest Things"" which is a show I truly miss.  The show celebrates poetry from Langston Hughes, one of my favorites and the music is fabulous.  My 2 year old gets so excited every time he hears ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" by The Mamas and The Papas now.  I had never heard of it before and love it now, too!

This show is just wonderful and I can't wait to get my permanent copy on dvd!",1194134400,5,723,4.078014184397163
2327285,5,B0009WIE52,"Real kids, real diversity, and real emotions instill respect for what we all share in common and our individual differences.  The best parts are the monologues from children who are incredibly aware of themselves as individuals, how they are different, and what that means to them.  I am from the generation where ""Free to Be You and Me"" (which focused mostly on the commonalities and differences between men and women) was shown in all local public schools.  In addition to sex role differences, this video takes on issues of race, size, disablity, language barriers, blindness, and other individual characteristics which are explained by real children.  This video is appropriate for ages 3 through adult and will promote an understanding, tolerance and respect for peoples' differences.",1126396800,17,789,5.288
2327286,5,B0009WIE52,A great way to teach diversity these days. Should be a required teaching instrument. My child loves to watch it on HBO and can't wait to get the video.,1126224000,,151,4.241379310344827
2327287,5,B0009WIE52,"and maybe by then acceptance, tolerance, appreciation, thoughtfulness, and compassion from children's peers would become learned instincts. The most direct and hypnotic logic through the variety of words, faces, and body languages.  The minds behind production of this film give tremendous hope for mankind that must begin during childhood.  A beautifully executed film addressing children by children.",1094428800,2,402,6.035087719298246

8068215,1,B0009WIE52,"Me and my husband was very pissed. This is a prime example of white soicety taking away african images from our children- the next generation. Dam have't they done enough of erasing our affluent history going far back as kemet. They really hate for us to express and love ourselves. This is a form of self hate, that the haters are producing wake up people. Then again what are we Africans expecting, they are in control of (tel a lie vision)we can't count who those who hate the race of the choosen  ones by the creator. We must take a stand and I don't mean marching with poster,  iI mean unity, united we stand and they fall it's as simple as that. This Dvd was very disrespectful, Im not knocking they kids in the film but those behind the camera. They key of it all is to create your own images for your child through books and the internet, we have a ubiquitous history seek and you shell find. And don't give and fall for the bates.",1455494400,4,939,4.299435028248587
8068216,3,B0009WIE52,"It was ok, the title is misleading I thought it was strictly about being proud of your natural African hair but it wasn't.  Though it did speak about other things like dwarfism, it wasn't what I was expecting.",1429488000,7,209,4.5
8068217,4,B0009WIE52,This has a lot of great examples of different children with different disabilities. I use this as a teaching tool in my elementary school for general education students.,1400025600,,169,5.071428571428571
8068218,5,B0009WIE52,"Emotionally honest.  Showcases the brilliant light and life inside each of us by celebrating vulnerability in expressive moments.  Kids without pretense.  Good, core stuff.  Love it - feel reconnected to myself when I watch it.",1391817600,,227,5.4
8068219,5,B0009WIE52,My third grade students enjoyed every second of it. It really created awareness of how our differences bring us together as a classroom and school community. THIS VIDEO IS VERY WELL DONE!!!! 10 stars.,1363219200,,200,4.911764705882353
8068220,2,B0009WIE52,"From the title, I thought the stories reflected black children and most of the characters in the movie are white.  Finding movies that my black children can identify with is extremely difficult.  I'm actually offended and pissed.  I returned it.  Diversity and tolerance is cool but I wasn't looking for that.  I wanted a movie that was entertaining and Black characters were the main characters.",1348790400,16,396,5.030769230769231
8068221,5,B0009WIE52,Very uplifting and Inspiring DVD.  The children had a lot of wisdom even in their young years.  I recommend this to all parents and grandparents.  View it with your children. :),1346976000,,177,4.645161290322581
8068222,5,B0009WIE52,"Amazing, short movie about what it's like to be different as a kid...it was eye opening for my 5 year old who's heading off to kindegarten. I was happy to be able to explain some things to her about being open to differences, kindness and inclusion using this movie as a tool.  Fantastic.",1313971200,,288,4.433962264150943
8068223,5,B0009WIE52,"This is a wonderful video about diversity. It is geared toward children and shows a multitude of children with differing abilities and experiences. The video shows children of different races, ages, genders and social classes. A MUST SEE!!",1302998400,,239,5.315789473684211
