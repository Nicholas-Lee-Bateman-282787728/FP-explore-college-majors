374153,3,6301802535,"While not my favourite Temple film, this was quite popular in it's day and the children should like it (especially since the colorization process has improved substantially). Shirley goes to live with her paternal Grandfather (C. Aubrey) with her mother (June Lang) in India. Queen Victoria's Regiment is the theme of the plot and in order to get her Grandfather's love and respect, Shirley goes to McLaglen and asks that he make her a soldier! Caesar Romero is good as Temple's Hindu confidante and Temple is credited for ending war. Ponderous and not terribly exciting, the military drills are rather impressive and the colour looks amazingly natural; a semi-classic which should appeal to younger kids.",958435200,,705,5.139130434782609
374154,5,6301802535,"For anyone who hasn't already seen it, this movie is a pleasant surprise.  It tells a rip-snortin' adventure yarn without sacrificing the familiar sentimental elements of a typical Shirley Temple movie.  There isn't much  of the usual light-hearted singing and dancing, but Shirley's infectious  charm manages to shine through in the story of a young girl in 19th century  India.  Cesar Romero plays Khoda Khan, the rebel leader who wants the  British out of his country.  C. Aubrey Smith plays Shirley's no-nonsense  grandfather, Colonel Williams, commanding the British military outpost.  The tough soldiers, especially Sergeant MacDuff (Victor McLaglen),  immediately fall under Shirley's spell, and make her the regiment mascot,  ""Private Winkie.""  Shirley also charms Khoda Khan while he is  held in the garrison jail.  (If she could bottle it, she would make a  fortune).  After Khoda Khan escapes to his rocky fortress, Shirley, with  the help of the slightly mad Mohammet Dihn (Willie Fung), follows Khan,  seeks to appease his anger at her grandfather, and tries to bring the two  men together in peace.  Shirley stomping her foot in frustration before the  howling rebel chieftains and calling them ""...very, very mean!""  because nobody takes her seriously is a great moment in this movie.  Believing the rebels have kidnapped his granddaughter, Colonel Williams  leads the regiment against the great steps of the rebel fortress, and  bloody conflict looms.
This movie succeeds for several reasons.  Shirley  Temple in an action-adventure flick sounds unlikely, but the result is  delightfully entertaining.  The portrayal of British colonialism reminds  the viewer of movies such as ""Gunga Din"" and Errol Flynn's  ""Charge of the Light Brigade.""  John Ford's direction adds a  comfortable blend of action, sentiment, and humor.  In characteristic John  Ford fashion, there is effective use of music (pipes and drums), especially  during an emotionally wrenching military funeral segment.  Shirley Temple  had progressed from her ""Good Ship Lollipop"" days, and presents a  slightly more grownup version of America's sweetheart.  Don't worry!  Her  trademark curls are intact.  Cesar Romero, obviously not Indian, does well  as the melancholy rebel chief.  C. Aubrey Smith is appropriately  Kiplingesque as the stuffy colonel.  The very Irish Victor McLaglen is  amusing as the Scottish sergeant.  Nothing particularly artistic to report  of this movie, but it's great fun for kids of all ages.  Make the popcorn,  gather the family around, and enjoy the ride.",954460800,4,2568,5.434782608695652

There is only one song sung by Ms. Temple in the movie, but It's one of my favorite songs.  It seems that when the movie was made, the era of the British in India was looked back with some fondness to have movies done about it (as Vietnam era movies were done many years after the fact), but still close enough that some people were still alive to remember ""the good old days""..

Full of many nice Ford touches; vignettes of interelationships held together during the drama of impending war.

374357,5,6301802535,"I never realized this film was originally released in different tints for different scenes until I read the story of its restoration, which is included on the DVD.  It was an unusual process at the time - usually a film was either in color or black and white.  The restoration is indeed a magnificent job!
\
 Wee Willie Winkie was Zanuck's way of trying to hold up his ""falling star"" by putting Shirley in a different ""formula"" and Wee Willie (as is Shirley's other 1937 release, Heidi) is a successful endeavor.  By 1937, box office audiences had grown a little weary of the ""little orphan Shirley"" plots that were essentially the same story with variations in each theme.  Zanuck paired Shirley with John Ford for the first time in an attempt to give her something more to do than dance and be cute.  Shirley found Ford to be a difficult director but someone she later bonded with and he even became her first child's godfather.  Missing from this film are the ""cutsey"" things written into Shirley's other pictures - the silly dialogue, or the ridiculously short dresses and ""baby talk"" that Fox's screen writers were using at the time in order to make her seem younger than she really was.  Toned down are some of her sometimes exaggerated cute gestures that got to be a bit much as she got older, and it really makes her acting ability shine beautifully.  (This was something Mrs. Temple pushed Fox for; to expand out of the ""same old"" plot lines and it was something they butted heads on frequently.)

The two films of 1937, both period pieces so they eliminated the ""song and dance frilly baby doll dresses and cutesy song lyrics"" of her 1936 films, provide a beautiful transition to the ""older"" Shirley that we see in 1938-1940.  Although her films went back to essentially the same types of stories in 1938, she had matured with an ""older child"" look; and her characters were more self reliant, smarter, mischievous and less baby like and helpless.  Wee Willie has Shirley breaking out of the ""perfect baby"" role into a more realistic child.  She disobeys by entering the soldiers barracks and conversing with them after being told not to - she doesn't  stay in the coach when there is an arrest in the streets, instead she leaves and gets mixed up in it, and she converses with Khoda Khan, the enemy, while his is in prison; something she has been forbidden to do.  All of these actions make her much more of a real child than the perfect cherub we see in films like Bright Eyes.  A spanking scene was actually filmed for this movie, but was cut prior to its release.

I was surprised at how long Wee Willie is - I don't recall it being that long, but perhaps because the TV print is sometimes shortened.  I really enjoyed this Shirley film - it was not one I recalled enjoying terribly much in the past, so I would say it's better suited for older children or adults due to its length and some of the longer scenes with adults.  While Shirley was still the #1 box office draw in 1937, both Wee Willie and Heidi faltered at the box office compared to her other films.  Today both of these films are classics are are no less worthy than her previous releases.

A lovely restoration --it's a shame that Fox doesn't find it necessary to do this with all of Shirley's film.  Stowaway, which came with my copy of Wee Willie is a shambles in my opinion.  It's grainy with scratch lines through it.  Other films, such as Poor Little Rich Girl and Our Little Girl haven't been been released on DVD at all except overseas, and we have to wonder why. Shirley is still so well loved and enjoyed today and all her films are deserving of being fully restored and released.",1324944000,8,3668,4.5227272727272725

374394,4,6301802535,"Fox continues to release the Temple films without any real extras; this one appears to be no exception. Since it was also part of a John Ford boxed set, it underwent an extensive overhaul (about 77 hours according to the background information on the DVD). Original elements at Fox were unusable for ""Winkie,"" but the final result is very good. There is NO colorized version to choose from here, but rather a sepia-tone version, just as the film was originally released. For film buffs, this is a plus!

""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) VERY loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's popular story. Taken by her mother (June Lang) to live in India, a young girl (Temple) gradually wins the heart of her feisty grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a colonel at a British army outpost. Before long, she captures the hearts of his entire regiment as well as his chief enemy (Cesar Romero), using her charms to prevent a full-scale war. Directed by John Ford; definitely one of Temple's best films, thanks to the chemistry between Temple & Romero, and Temple & Victor McLaglen (get the hankies out for one of their scenes). Presented as a flipper disc featuring a tinted version of the film (in a very pleasing sepia tone) that was based on original notes and research to make the film look as it was first released as well as the black and white original, both in their original full-screen theatrical aspect ratio. With English Stereo plus English and Spanish Mono, the feature also includes English, French and Spanish subtitles. 100 minutes. Bonus feature: Restoration Comparison which describes in detail what was done.

This film is also available as part of the John Ford collection AND as part of Volume 6 in Fox's Shirley Temple Collection.",1209168000,10,1726,4.8474576271186445

374396,5,6301802535,"Rudyard Kipling stories have always translated well to film and television, think The Jungle Book, The Man Who Would Be King, and Wee Willie Winkie is no exception.  In India in 1897, young Priscilla Williams and her mother Joyce are traveling by train to a remote British outpost commanded by Priscilla's grandfather.  Upon arriving, Priscilla finds out that her grandfather doesn't quite know how to interact with little girls so she decides her best option to get to know him is to become a soldier.  With the help of the friendly Sgt. Donald McDuff, Priscilla tries to become a soldier, and with a new name at that, Private Wee Willie Winkie.  There is something undescribable about this film that makes it so good.  It hits all the right notes throughout.  Seen through Wee Willie Winkie's eyes, everything is very innocent and child-like, an example being she can't see why the British and Indians are at war.  All this just makes the movie work that much better.  Everything is working well here, so don't miss this movie.

  Shirley Temple gives one of her best performances as Priscilla Williams, a precocious little girl who is always curious and therefore always asking questions.  She's able to do the comedic and dramatic scenes equally well.  Victor McLagen is incredible as Sgt. Donald MacDuff, the soldier who befriends Priscilla and teaches her to become a soldier, giving her a new name and a pint size uniform, toy rifle and all.  Temple and McLaglen's scenes together are what takes this movie from a very good to a great movie, especially their last scene together.  It's too bad the always reliable McLaglen didn't get some kind of recognition for his role here.  C. Aubrey Smith plays Colonel Williams, Priscilla's grandfather and commander of the post who initially doesn't know how to interact with his granddaughter but ends up becoming very close.  June Lang is good in a small part as Joyce, Priscilla's widowed mother trying to adjust to her new life with a crush on the outpost, ""Coppy"" as Priscilla calls him, Lt. Brandes.  And a young Cesar Romero rounds out the main cast as Khoda Khan, a leader of the Indian opposition to the British.  He too has some very strong scenes with Temple.

  Now, I haven't seen the VHS so I can't answer to its quality, but the movie is now available in DVD format as part of the ""Ford at Fox"" collection.  I can't say you should buy the whole set, it's pretty expensive, for one movie, but if you like John Ford movies, especially his early ones, then the set is a safe buy.  The disc for Wee Willie Winkie doesn't have any special features, but it offers the black and white version and the tinted version.  Th B&W version looks very good and cleaned up from some TV versions.  So if you get a chance, watch Wee Willie Winkie, you won't be disappointed!",1199145600,,2819,4.6904276985743385

But, in my opinon its one of her better movies.

Take into account there is no singing or dance squences instead there are battles, and a lot of gore. You might want to view it yourself before you watch it with your children or grand-children! The story takes place in India when the British were still occupying it Shirley and her widow mother move onto a army base to be with her grandfather. But, they move when the area is on the brink of war with the natives. Shirley trying to please her grandfather asks Sgt. Mc. Duff to help her train to be a solider and Shirley manages to capture the hearts of all those on the base.

When Shirley's soldier friend Victor McLaglen dies of his wounds in his hospital bed during Shirley's visit, it is obvious to the audience, but not to the naive child. I found that scene the most touching in the whole movie.  In other respects, it is a very good piece of movie-making, with old war horses C. Aubrey Smith and Cesar Romero turning in solid performances as Shirley's commander-grandfather and the villainous enemy to British concerns, respectively. Shirley manages to quell troubles in India, at least for now, by virtue of her innocence and pluck. Well worth seeing.",995500800,10,733,4.911290322580645
374402,5,6301802535,"This is an outstanding movie. What makes it so fantastic is that it isn't just a great Shirley Temple vehicle...it's a great FILM all the way around. The director, John Ford, the supporting cast, including Victor McLaglen and Caesar Romero, and the production values are all top of the line.
The story seems predictable at first--once again, Shirley's precocious character, Priscilla, is missing a parent (this time, her father). As in some of her other films, she goes to live in a new environment with a grumpy older relative (this time, her grandfather, a British military general).
This is where the similarities end, however. Priscilla decides she isn't content sitting at home with her Mum, sewing samplers--she wants to join the Queen's Army. With the help of Sgt. MacDuff (McLaglen), she procures an official uniform, learns the drills, and adopts a military name--Wee Willie Winkie (the name, by and by, comes from a Scottish nursery rhyme). She also dabbles in international diplomacy by striking up a friendship with the Indian leader jailed in the army camp, Khoda Khan (Romero). When Khan's chieftains attack the base, it's up to Winkie to find a way to achieve peace.
One neat thing about this film is the theme of empowerment it has for young girls. It was made in 1937, and set in the prim-and-proper Victorian era--and it was about a little girl joining the army! Priscilla holds her own among the soldiers--at one point in the film, unhappy with a decree made by her grandfather, she storms into his office to argue about it (and she wins the argument!). The film sends the message that girls CAN do anything--be it sew or march in the army.
There is also a strong message of peace, in spite of all the military trappings--the battle between the British and Indian forces is not solved with guns or cannons, but through mediation. Winkie impresses her fellow soliders not by killing people, but by using her head and thinking things through.
Ford's direction is beautiful, and the script is strong. There are several extremely memorable scenes: the one that stands out in my mind is at the end of the film, when Khoda Khan, Winkie and the British general meet on a hill, surrounded by British and Indian troops.
Temple is wonderful in this--it is probably her strongest dramatic film and one of the best story-wise. She actually did her own stunts in this film--the scene where she ran across the path of the stampeding horses wasn't done with camera tricks!  McLaglen is endearing as Sgt. MacDuff. Romero is also phenomenal--he makes Khoda Khan much more than a one-dimensional villain.
No, this isn't a light, happy musical. It IS, however, a film with a lot going for it, and definitely worthwhile.",987984000,28,2719,4.859913793103448
374403,3,6301802535,"This Shirley Temple film is one of my least favorites and is not suitable for young children-they'll just be bored.  Shirley doesn't dazzle her audience with her musical talents, which gives the movie a downside already.  She plays a prim and proper English daughter named Pricilla living in India with her grandfather (a colonel) and mother on military grounds.  She then decides she wants to be a member of her grandfather's army to make him proud of her.  Her soldier name becomes Wee Willie Winke.  The movie is very boring and very much drags it's story line.  At the end, Shirley saves the world from war.  Although the movie is dull, I must ammit Shirley is a very good actress in the movie.  She is dramatic, sweet, and tough. The only reason ""Shirley lovers"" should buy this movie is to see her great display of acting talent.",979862400,2,835,4.63265306122449
7816353,5,6301802535,"Wee Willie Winkie, Directed by America's finest director, John Ford, is a military tale of adventure set in Afghanistan of the 1800s. At the center is a little girl who has come to the fort with her mother, because her father has died and there is nowhere else for them to go. Wee Willie Winkie worms her way into the hearts of the hardened soldiers and swell the heart and is bound to bring a tear to your eye by its conclusion. Its a clear example of why miss Temple became an international star.",1520899200,,498,4.308510638297872

7816355,4,6301802535,"The film's story is on the thin side, but it does a superlative job recreating India during the British Raj. I was surprised that it was all shot in California as it has many details and exotic color. As with other Ford films, we enter a world with rituals, culture, music, tradition, uniforms, and language.

Shirley Temple shines with her usual charm, but the death scene where she sings Auld Lang Syne is simply outstanding. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes. She perfectly portrays a child's incomprehension of death, although she knows there's something wrong with Sergeant MacDuff.",1517529600,,594,4.881188118811881

Great movie and overall I would still watch this DVD in either B&W or the quasi-color, but don't buy this if you are thinking this will be a colorized version.",1502582400,,336,4.234375
