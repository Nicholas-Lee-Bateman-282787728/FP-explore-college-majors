7834115,2,6302999723,"Alice in Wonderland: A Dance Fantasy is a bad example of how books can be turned into great films. This not-even half hour ballet is utterly disturbing and vile in its nature. I liked the style, but the plot that the Alice stories are famous for is absent and the memorable characters we once knew have been replaced with boring or just stupid characters who we just want out of our faces. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it reminds me of a school play, and I love those. I guess I was just expecting a ""bit"" more than this. It might have been better if I hadn't have been comparing it to other Alice films, but I still think it is strange.",1059955200,3,655,4.165354330708661
