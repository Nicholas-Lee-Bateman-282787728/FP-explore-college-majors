Her love for singing and a new friendship helps her transcend the role of town oaf by showcasing her magnificent  singing ability on a local talent show after her prerequisite makeover (!?!). Was this a feel good movie??!!  The Singing was really  er, there are no words. But  I did make it to the end of the movie (that was the positive comment) I guess I was drawn to the movie in a sick sort of way. Fini",1374710400,,544,4.520408163265306
8060724,4,B0009GX1O2,"Marilyn is a hairdresser in Switzerland.  She's overweight, underemployed, and is having an affair with the mayor of the town.  Meanwhile Georg, her partner in the salon would like to marry her and she also strikes up a friendship with a gay musician named Halil.

Marilyn has dreams of being a singer and composing her own songs.  Her journey from hairdresser/mistress to singer composer is both touching and funny.
