8180337,5,B000NOWUZ6,"Thank you Mr. Waite!!!  This is a keeper, for me.  And to think I almost didn't look at the Photo Gallery -- so much of it and so touching!

The Maharishi himself appears, talking, throughout most of the film, which is what I was after.  And also wonderful to see the Guru Dev featured, so to better see where the Maharishi came from.

I had taken the TM course back in college in the early '70's and this reminded me so much of that  -- back when it seemed it would be youth, bluejeans, and sunny days forever, just like the time on this film where we find the Maharishi appearing.

Don't know how 2013 finds the maker of this film, but thanks again.",1373414400,2,651,4.201612903225806
8180338,5,B000NOWUZ6,"This is a wonderful DVD of Maharishi in the 1960s.  I thoroughly enjoyed going back in time to hear his instruction and guidance into the life-changing practice of Transcendental Meditation and I am greatful to this documentarian for making it available.  I took the TM training in the 80s but fell out of practice in recent years, but this film inspired me to begin again and I could not be happier!  Forget the BS about ""flying Yogis"" and other over-the-top cultish claims of the Maharishi University in Iowa today. The meditation technique does everything for me that Maharishi talks about in the video: peace of mind, calm, clearer thinking, and a much better outlook on life - that's all I care about. Best of all, it has NOTHING to do with religious beliefs.",1331337600,8,764,4.7293233082706765
8180339,4,B000NOWUZ6,"It was a great moment when the DVD arrived and I got into it as soon as possible. It was sent by the author himself giving all his coordinates with the DVD. It is rare to have a personal relation granted with the purchase but it is well within the spirit of the matter.  For all of those who luck information on how the Indian spirituality actually arrived in the west, this is a very important document. I immediately after watching the DVD bought the book ' Science of being and art of living by Maharishi and was taken into the world of TM. I would say that the DVD is almost a collectors item by now.",1243296000,6,604,4.162393162393163
8180340,5,B000NOWUZ6,"As a child of the 60's, I was intrigued by the title of this film and thought I would take a chance and buy the DVD.  It blew me AWAY!!!  For a film from the late 60's this movie is way ahead of its time in terms of technical and aesthetic boundries.  Seeing and hearing the Maharishi interact and discuss his philosophy and teachings about Trancendental Mediation is something to be preserved for ALL TIME!  This individual from the East who started something new in the West and is now practiced throughout the World - is monumental.  The highlights for me was seeing the Maharishi landing in Tahoe aboard Bill Lear's jet with Bill Lear himself piloting the plane; the interviews with ""the man on the street""; meeting the original leaders of the US movement; seeing a young Tina Sinatra interviewing the Maharishi in Tahoe; filming in Watts (Los Angeles) only 3 years after the riots of 1965.  I cannot say enough about the music of the great Paul Horn playing in the background.  This film is an exceptional documentary that not only provides the viewer with a taste of the excitement generated by this man, but an insightful look into the Maharishi, his sense of humor and his wonderful demeanor.  The director, Alan Waite did a phenomenal job, but let's face it, he had tremendous inspiration, when you realize the Maharishi commissioned Alan (a TM'er himself) to make this movie and participated in its final version.  But you continue to receive more and more....  The Bonus Features include wonderful pictures of the Maharishi in different world locales, hearing him tell us - in his own words how he started the movement in the United States and lastly director Alan Waite's commentary about the background or the genesis for a particular scene is magnificent.  Anyone, anywhere in the World, who loves this man, believes in his teachings and philosphies, who uses Transcendental Meditation, or wants a front row seat into the Man, his Mission and his/its history needs to have this film in their library!  No college class on contemporary history would be complete without this beautiful historical masterpiece!  Do yourself a favor and pick up this DVD.  You'll watch it over and over again.",1174435200,13,2202,4.8373333333333335
