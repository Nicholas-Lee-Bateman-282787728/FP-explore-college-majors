2726579,5,B000M7XRC4,"The second season of Adult Swim's The Venture Bros. surpasses its first in nearly every way. The first season introduced us to the Venture universe, which is occupied by hilarious characters who never cease to reach new levels of incompetance. Many of the episodes were laugh-out-loud hilarious that remained so throughout the entire half hour. So if season 1 was taht good, yet this year is so much better, that really says something to the quality of season 2.

The precredits sequence of the season premiere, ""Powerless in the Face of Death"", is amazing to watch, though some of its power may be lost on DVD. There was a 2-year gap between seasons 1 and 2, and season 1 ended with the deaths of Hank and Dean Venture, the title characters. In the hiatus period, there was a lot of speculation of how the show would go on (Dr. Thaddeus Venture and his brother Jonas Venture, Jr. would be the new Venture Bros., Dr. Orpheus would ressurect them, Dr. Venture would clone them, Dr. Venture would use the Grover Cleveland time machine to save them), and it would be an understatement to say that fans were eagerly awaiting to see what happened next. Set to the tune of the song Everybody's Free, the opening sequence is a montage of the various major characters, reminding us where they were left and how they are dealing with their various situations. Dr. Orpheus is still upset about the boys' deaths, for which he blames himself, the Monarch is still in prison while Dr. Girlfriend appears happy, if somewhat bored, living with Phantom Limb, and the Mondarch's henchmen have nowhere else to go after blowing up the Coccoon lair. Pete White and Master Billy Quizboy have fitted Jonas with a robotic hand replacing his deformed chicken-wing-like appendage. Meanwhile, it appears that Dr. Venture hasn't been coping well with his sons deaths. He steals the X-1 jet, forcing his bodyguard Brock Samson to go on a global hunt for the good doc.

By the end of the first episode, we find out the creepy truth about the Venture Bros, which was heavily hinted at in the first season. From there the 13 episodes of the season, with possibly one exception, are superb. One thing I liked this year was that there was a little more of an overarching story to the season. The first year had episodes that were pretty much all stand-alone stories, which work with a show like the Venture Bros., but I'm a huge fan of serialized story-telling, and when I started to see developing stories at the end of season 1, I was really excited. The season's arc actually has to do with the villains, though. It is about the Monarch's quest to get Dr. Girlfriend back from Phantom Limb. The first two episodes of the season show how he escapes from prison and begins to rebuild his influence. Throughout the season, episodes like ""Victor. Echo. November."" and ""I Know Why The Caged Bird Kills"" show the hilarious journey that the Monarch takes to win back his love from a vastly superior villain.

Still, there are plenty of stand-alone episodes. In my opinion, no other Venture episode embodies that idea so well than ""Escape From the House of Mummies, Part II"". The episode satirizes multi-episode stories, as there is no Part I, but it also pulls a huge trick by switching around the A and B stories. While the story of Hank, Dean, and Brock's journey through a cursed temple accompanied by various historical figures would normally be the focus of the episode, it is merely the backup story that supplements the story of a silly bet between Dr. Orpheus and Dr. Venture over whether magic or science is superior. ""Twenty Years to Midnight"" is a great example of parody of adventure tales, with the Venture family trying to track down various pieces of a machine built by Hank and Dean's grandfather. The Impossible family, a wonderfully twisted parody of the Fantastic Four, show up to make things more difficult for the Ventures, and a cameo by Johnny Quest (the main influence of the show) make for an amazing episode. Nearly every episode was phenominal (with the exception of ""Guess Who's Coming to State Dinner?"", which even the creators kind of agree with), from ""Fallen Arches"", which introduces Dr. Orpheus' old team to ""Hate Floats"", which features a team-up of Phantom Limb and Brock.

The season ends with the 2-part extravaganza ""Showdown at Cremation Creek"", which completely changes the status quo for the next season. There is a wedding, a huge battle led by Brock and soldiered by the Monarch's henchmen, a bizarre fantasy sequence involving Dean filling in the role of the lead in The Neverending Story, and David Bowie! It ends with a great cliffhanger, though after having the title characters die, it would be hard to match the season 1 cliffhanger.

While there are plenty of crazy situations, the show wouldn't be half of what it is without the amazing characters. With few exceptions, everyone in the Venture universe is somehow a failure. Dr. Venture is utterly incompetant as a ""super-scientist"" despite what he believes, his sons are oblivious to nearly everything in life (Dean and Hank think that an erection is caused by evil spirits), and Brock, though a great bodyguard, has no self-control. The Monarch and his henchmen can barely do their ""jobs""; the Monarch is jealous, weak, and unable to understand why people can't get anything done, while his henchmen are out of shape nerds who quiver at the words ""Brock Samson"". Though Dr. Orpheus is a competant necromancer, he is a know-it-all workaholic who drives away the people he cares about.

Most guest stars from season 1 returned, including the Pirate Captain, the Impossibles, Peter White and Billy Quizboy, Baron Underbheit, and the Impossibles. All of these characters were loved by fans, and were effectively used this year as well. But there were plenty of new characters this year that quickly became fan favorites as welll. Personally, I really want to see more of Jefferson Twighlight and The Alchemist, the two other members of Dr. Orpheus' group the Order of the Triad. Twilight is a parody of Blade and the Alchemist is a gay monk who can't really decided what to do with his life (voiced by Dana Snyder of Aqua Teen Hunger Force). Dr. Henry Killinger is a hilarious ""consultant"" whose true purpose is better left to be found out while watching. Finally, there was the strange Observor from ""Twenty Years to Midnight"", whose catchphrase ""IGNORE ME!"" was incredibly funny every time it was spoken.

Despite one misstep, this is a great season of animated television. Many shows on Adult Swim's lineup (that were created for AS) look awful; the animation and/or plot appear to be worth almost nothing, but the Venture Bros. is at the other end of the spectrum. Despite being underrated, it is one of the funniest cartoons I've ever seen, ranking up there with South Park and The Simpsons.",1169510400,88,6859,4.807627118644068
2726580,5,B000M7XRC4,"The Venture Bros. is sort of a combination of Johnny Quest gone horribly, inappropriately wrong combined with parodies of other classic cartoons, comic books and pop culture tossed into a blender creating a deliciously sharp mix capable of producing side-splitting laughter. This hilarious parody covers the range from Fantastic Four, Scooby Doo, Hardy Boys and everything in between. Every bit of the ridiculous physics and sensibilities of comic books, cartoons and juvenile fiction is lampooned with razor-edged wit. This is one of the best of the Adult Swim cartoons to run on Cartoon Network and I can't wait to have this set on DVD so I can freeze-frame and dissect all the great moments. Season One of The Venture Bros. was terrific and Season Two was even better. Several episodes of Season Two are particularly good, including ""Hate Floats"" and ""Fallen Arches."" Highly recommended!",1169424000,4,890,5.1875
2726581,5,B000M7XRC4,"I bought season 2 on iTunes, and I can't help but be compelled to get the dvd version as well... Being a huge fan of season 1, I worried that the series might loose steam. Much to my delight, I think AstroBase Go! & Noodle Soup really came into their own with this round of episodes.

WARNING: The introduction to 'Hate Floats' (episode 2:2) may cause viewers to laugh hard enough to either cry, soil themselves, or likely both.",1168300800,8,428,4.417721518987341
2726582,5,B000M7XRC4,"One of the funniest shows on Adult Swim is the ""Venture Brothers,"" a deeply warped look at boys' adventure characters like Jonny Quest and the Hardy Brothers.

The second season is basically much the same as the first, building on previous storylines (example: Jonas Jr.) and having various kooky violent adventures for our friends, and hilarious dialogue (""You've come to steal our great ideas. You've been foiled--we have none!""). That is, after they deal with the shocking cliffhanger that the first season ended with-- the death of Hank and Dean, the title characters.

The second season opens with Dr. Venture escaping to various exotic locales, before being dragged home by Brock. A devastated Dr. Orpheus decides to use necromancy to bring the boys back to life, but can't find their souls -- and a zombielike Hank and Dean appear in the doorway.

Oops, it turns out that the boys have a penchant for getting killed, and so Dr. Venture always keeps handy clones in the compound -- and presto, the Venture Brothers have returned, unaware that they ever died. Meanwhile, Dr. Venture has a nasty encounter with a teleportation device, and the Monarch escapes from prison (courtesy of a gay gorilla with a romantic streak).

In the episodes that follow, the newly cloned Venture Brothers (plus Dr. Venture and Brock) must deal with a variety of new and bizarre adventures: a crazy woman who might be connected to the twins, evil Egyptian cults, aliens, Lincoln's ghost, Japanese demons, ""Venturestein,"" villainous double-dates, bad porn, and Baron &Uuml;nderbheit mistaking Dean for a girl... and falling in love with him.

The second season of ""Venture Brothers"" is, if it's possible, even funnier than the first was -- the storylines just keep getting stranger and more comic, and the characters are just as kooky as ever. The climax of all the weirdness is the finale, with a big battle, and a shocking discovery about the Guild's Sovereign... right before we get another cliffhanger.

On the new front, there's plenty of unethical experiments, blood'n'gore, wacky quests, teenage crushes, and two-part episodes with no ""part 1."" And since we were left wondering about questions like ""where is the twins' mother?"", ""how did Brock get this way?"" or ""when will Dr. Orpheus get an arch?"", we actually get some answers on that front. Since this is the ""Venture Bros,"" there are no remotely normal ones.

The stories are as well-written as ever, with weird plot details (when &Uuml;nderbheit hears that there are no holding cells, he orders ""Put zhem in... ZE PANTRY!""), and gloriously wonky dialogue (""I have watched you pull a man's eyes from his head and make him dance like a marionette with his own optic nerves!"" "" At least I didn't break his heart"").

James Urbaniak is excellent as ""amphetamines and failure"" scientist Rusty Venture, and Patrick Warburton is (as always) hilarious as the bloodthirsty Swede secret agent Brock. Michael Sinterniklaas and Christopher McCulloch are also great as (respectively) Dean, Hank and the whiny-voiced Monarch, and  Steven Ratazzi is great as the hyperdramatic necromancer. Too bad a certain real-life person doesn't play himself.

The second season of ""Venture Brothers"" is every shred as good as the first one, and will leave viewers dangling painfully at the end. When does Season 3 start?",1167264000,52,3339,5.076642335766423

2726660,5,B000M7XRC4,"So this is season 2 of Venture Brothers, and if you're considering this purchase it should mean that you've already watched season 1.  Venture Bros has a very particular type of humor, and you either love it or you hate it.  Since you've made it this far in you should already know which of those is true for you.  If you enjoyed the first season then you're going to love season 2.  If Venture Bros humor didn't work for you so far, I wouldn't bother with this purchase.

For fans of the show, this is a great build upon what came before.  We get more interesting background and development on each of the unique characters, and the humor is just as great as what you've come to expect.  I highly recommend picking up season 2, it's well worth watching a few times over.

A note of caution, there is one episode partway through this season that claims to be ""part 2!"" continuing from an earlier episode.  No, you didn't miss an episode, there was no ""part 1,"" the part 2 bit is just part of the joke.",1388707200,,1001,4.310160427807487

2726691,5,B000M7XRC4,"I have nothing but good things to say about ""The Venture Brothers: Season Two,"" which chronicles the continued misadventures of failed super-scientist 'Dr.' Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, his naive and socially inept sons Hank and Dean, their savage bodyguard Brock Samson and myriad other friends, associates, villains and arch-enemies.  I think it intriguing that the four main characters are effectively the most consistent, having evolved the least throughout either the first or second seasons... and though the secondary characters are, well, secondary, the plot of each episode evolves predominantly around one or more of them at a time - for reasons that I cannot really explain, this works extremely well for the program.

The program itself all boils down to a darkly hilarious spoof on a 45-year-old Hanna-Barbera action cartoon... or, as I said in my review of The Venture Brothers: Season 1, ""'Johnny Quest' gone horribly, horribly wrong..."" and again, that is all you need to know.",1255737600,,990,5.2993630573248405
2726692,5,B000M7XRC4,"What's up with the Monarch and Dr. Venture? Related? Is it an ""Austin Powers"" type thing? Anyway.

So they say it's a show about failure? I can see that's true BUT it is life affirming, sort of.
Actually of all the Adult Swim shows Venture Brothers has mainstream appeal and potential for a much, much larger audience than it enjoys now. Or it would if America wasn't so hung up on naughty language and sexual references. Things change though. Just look at South Park. (I still can't believe what they get away with, so who knows?) But only airing late on Adult Swim it will never be as popular a success as Fox cartoons. (Maybe that's OK, I'm just sayin.)
Anyway, I did read a review of Venture Brothers by this guy Michael Abernethy for ""Pop Matters"" that dismisses the show as ""idiotic"" and says his ""nightmares are more enjoyable than this infantile series"". I really didn't know we're supposed to take the show so seriously. See, that's why people love to hate critics. He get's it all wrong. I'd say if you haven't seen it, don't be looking for the sharp social commentary of a South Park or the Simpsons -that isn't the point of the freakin' show. Properly viewed without a stick up your --- Venture Brothers can be enjoyed (by adults) as a lighthearted homage to Johnny Quest and seemingly countless adventure serials, pulp magazines, television shows, movies, toys, fashion trends, and comic books. Characters directly based on James Bond and Blade to GI Joe commandos and Scooby-Doo and Star Wars make appearances as do real-life media personalities Hunter S. Thompson and David Bowie -both enjoying memorable roles in the series as themselves, so to speak. No change to names or alteration of looks. (Well just certain body parts in one case). I just got a kick out of a show so loaded with cultural references and one that would feature a figure like Hunter Thompson and in the way that it does. For that matter Bowie's role is perfect.

What really makes the Venture Brothers a great show are the rich background stories to all the characters, some of whom are purely original creations. The writers know what they are doing. I wonder what the story is with Dr. Venture and the Monarch, really? Is it an Austin Powers type deal? Read a perfect tag for the show that also sums-up why I dig it: ""If filmmakers Woody Allen and Sam Peckinpah had collaborated on Jonny Quest, it would have come out a lot like this."" I love Woody Allen and Sam Peckinpah. Highly recommended show.

Season 2, in humble opinion not only vastly surpassed everyone's expectations -taking the series to another level- but so far it is the best. 3 is up there though. Best to go chronologically and see the incredible development of all the characters and their rich, highly entertaining background stories.",1248134400,,2792,4.705521472392638

Season 2 improves over season 1 in every aspect. While season 1 had a good number of ""miss"" episodes, season 2 really only had 1 or 2. The characters are more developed than they were, and Jackson and Doc really know exactly where they want to go, whereas for season 1 it seemed alot more episodic and ad-hoc.

The special features are good, but not amazing. The tour of Astrobase Go! was amusingly cheesy, but otherwise not terribly interesting. The deleted scenes have a few funny moments, but were largely cut because they obviously didn't add much in most cases.

2726697,5,B000M7XRC4,"The Venture Bros. is something of a sleeper hit in my world; I had never paid it any mind until my roommate brought the first two seasons home on DVD. While not as blatantly non sequitor as Aqua Teen hunger Force or as humorously ADD addled as Robot Chicken, the Venture Bros. series offers some of the best comical writing on Adult Swim, period... and season 2 drives this point home beyond a shadow of a doubt. Season one established a world where super scientists, necromancers and villain unions are commonplace and failure, both in an epic and mundane sense, is the central theme. The second season expands upon this established universe and theme with a slew of new material that easily surpasses season one. It's clear that Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick draw from a wide variety of influences that they blend into a seamless world of action, intrigue and unparalleled hilarity. All things Pulp, Sci Fi and Pop Culture are hilariously and cleverly lampooned, be it obscure comic book parodies that hearken to the golden and silver age of Marvel Comics or the days of Doc Savage or unexpected music sub culture references that resonate with fans of the goth, punk classic rock and new wave scenes. Being that it borrows from such a wide and diverse palette of things to mock, I can honestly assert that Venture Bros. has material to offer a wide variety of pop culture enthusiasts from all walks of life.

2726699,5,B000M7XRC4,"Review of ""The Venture Brothers--Season 2:""

Without a doubt the most intelligent show (animated or otherwise) that has been released in awhile.

The Venture Brothers is a witty and sarcastic parody mix of (but not limited to) Scooby Doo; Johnny Quest; Mission Impossible; all of the cartoons and culture of the 1960's and 1970's; G.I. Joe; James Bond; NASA Space Programs; references to the 1980's; contemporary social culture; Marvel and DC Superheroes; etc., etc.

If you grew up in the 1970's and 1980's you will absolutely relate. Without sounding obtuse, you will either ""get it"" or you will not. My opinion is that if you do, you will love it.

This single show makes me remember and relive many fond memories of my childhood and yet is still relevant for today. Super at five stars.",1234742400,,790,4.82962962962963

The villians in this series are simply hilarious and watching the first few season episodes and seeing what goes on with ""The Monarch"" in prison and what happened to his ""henchmen"" was simply hilarious!

2726707,5,B000M7XRC4,"I have to admit that I was wondering how the 2nd season could trump the first. It's a common problem with great series where all of the good ideas are used in the first season, or they fold to pressure & create ridiculous triangles or use cliche plot devices. Not so with the Venture Bros. Any plot cliches or triangles are used as either a parody device or something to actually further the plot along rather than something to spin wheels with.

This season sees the fleshing out of the Monarch & Dr. Girlfriend's relationship, as well as showing a little more of all the characters you've grown to love.

The DVD set is pretty nice, and I love the feel of the cover art. Since most of the jokes are brought from old series & movies, it's highly suitable to make the poster for the cover have an aged feel to it.",1215388800,,813,4.30718954248366
2726708,5,B000M7XRC4,"Prepare for an even more hilarious season of the greatest cartoon on TV - better than 'Aqua Teen' because it's more intelligent, otherwise that would be the sentimental favorite - as the episodes follow a season-long story arc involving the Monarch's attempts to win back Dr. Girlfriend.

As Dr. Venture, Brock and the boys continue their misadventures, they manage to parody Scooby Doo, 'Oz,' 'The Manchurian Candidate' and even Henry Kissinger. Add to that Dr. Orpheus trying to get his old super-hero team back together (hint: one's a  homosexual monk, and the other is a 50-something version of Wesley Snipes' Blade character with a crackhead-like addiction to Nik-L-Nips... you remember, the syrup in a wax bottle?). If you DON'T remember, the Venture Brothers may be lost on you. Constant pop-culture and old-school cartoon references keep quick heads laughing the entire season long.

As always, Hank and Dean Venture's complete lack of any practical knowledge provides much of the humor, but the interaction between each of the neurotic characters and how they all deal with the fact that they're basically running around playing superhero continues to delight.",1214092800,,1169,5.274193548387097

2726711,5,B000M7XRC4,"As I'm writing this, season 3 has just premiered. While it is unfortunate that 2 years pass between each season, I'm happy.  I really admire this show as an original creation. In the last few years Adult Swim has gotten steadily  less funny (Metalocalypse, Assy McGee) or just plain stupid (Tom Goes to the Mayor, Tim and Eric Awesome Show), so any new Venture Bros should be celebrated. About once a month, I watch both my DVD sets in one run (since Adult Swim rarely, if ever, plays the show).
The thing that I like most about the show isn't just the comedy, it's how cool things get when the action gets ramped up. This is used to great effect in the second season (see ""Victor, Echo, November"", ""Assassinanny 911"", ""Hate Floats""). And yes, Brock Samson is the coolest character ever - the best episodes seem to pivot around him. Kudos should go to Patrick Warburton. While he has done A LOT of voice work over the years (Joe on Family Guy, Kronk, Jak and the power of Ju-Ju, the wolf in Hoodwinked), he voices Brock differently - that quiet, whispery intensity is just awesome. That scene in ""Victor, Echo, November"" where he's naked, covered in blood saying: ""To feed on their fear, to...feel the kill"". Great.
Not to say I don't like the comedy - the Scooby-Doo send-up in ""Viva Los Muertos"" is a classic for the ages. And the Monarch's two henchmen speak to the sci-fi geek boy inside all of us. And isn't Dr. Orpheus just the best Doctor Strange joke?
So, while Adult Swim does have its problems (the overemphasis on Family Guy, the totally horrendous live action shows like ""Tim and Eric""), this show, ""Boondocks"", and ""Frisky Dingo"" show how cartoons can be action packed, funny, and warrant repeated viewing.",1212883200,,1719,4.632786885245902

Thirteen excellent episodes that surpass the first season, starting with the season opener ""Powerless in the Face of Death"" that begins with the song ""Everybody's Free"" and a great montage of what everyone is doing, the return of the Underbhiet in ""Love Bheits"" & Molotov Cocktease in ""Assasinanny 911"", a wonderfully titled ""Twenty Years to Midnight"", and the final two-parter ""Showdown at Cremation Creek""

The packaging and cover art are simply great. The line ""Love never blows up and gets killed"" is hilarious considering just how the Venture boys make their return.

The ""Extras"" consists of deleted scenes and a ""tour"" of Astro-Base Go which is a very cheap, but funny video.  It certainly appears that the creators don't take themselves that seriously which is a good thing. I do get the feeling that they've been bitten by the same ""performance"" bug that Trey Parker & Matt Stone from ""South Park"" got. Guys, just because you can create funny stuff doesn't mean that you come across as funny.

My one complaint is about the DVD commentary which is pretty bad on virtually every episode.  Its one thing to go off on tangents, but most of the commentary is just the guys talking about nothing in particular.  Hopefully they'll think of DVD commentary a bit differently on the next season, which will probably come out in the Fall of 2008.

That 1964 prime-time series did more to spark this boomer's love of animated action and adventure than anything else on TV in that decade. The Venture Bros., however, manages to trump my nostalgic enthusiasm by revisiting the concept: Both series feature a single-dad scientist travelling the world with a no-nonsense bodyguard and a pair of teenage boys, but the new one found a way to make it work for an adult sensibility: It's screamingly funny. And the new series goes places the Quest Team could never have imagined, like subletting their lab space to a over-the-hill mystic and his teenaged Goth daughter. And The Venture Bros. adds a layer of goofy superheroics, like some demented version of the Marvel Universe, to the mix.

The Venture Bros. stretches its low budget to great lengths not just with inventive visuals, but some of the most densely-plotted, richly-appointed and downright-hilarious writing anywhere on TV. Every episode pays new benefits on repeat viewings, with both verbal asides too quick to catch the first time around and insights and commentary on the genre that sailed over the head of pre-teen viewers in decades past. If you think a walking Robot Eye or hordes of evil henchmen dressed as flying butterflies are simultaneously ridiculous and, well, wicked boss, this is the show for you.

If you love any of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup, then you should love Venture Brothers. How could you not love this sick, twisted takeoff / spoof of Jonny Quest? Heck, they even use Quest in a few episodes.

I have friends from college who are exactly like 21 and 24 (except they don't actually 'hench').

2726751,5,B000M7XRC4,"Ok... let me start out with what I don't like about Season two: The narrative has gotten a little too soap-opera-y for my tastes. Now there is less emphasis on the action and adventure, and we are made to go from episode to episode with more emotional baggage from the characters. I know that this is usually indicative of sophmoric outings, so I'll let it slide - here's hoping that now that we know (too much) about the characters, we can get back to the witty, slightly retro thrills and fun that was the hallmark of the first season. That season is a must to enjoy this one, although the animation seems to have improved as well as the general art direction. Characterwise, all the favorites from the first season are here, and they are delved into more deeply. And the first episode here is a great, if sometimes draging, answer to the last seson's cliff-hanger question. The opening sequence alone calls to mind a deserved nod to Alan Ball's benidiction/finale of  Six Feet Under. From there, we get more explanations, and less action, but if you love the characters, you hang on. Favorite episode would be "" Echo Bravo Niner"" which treats us to what made season one so enjoyable: Action, irreverence, complete episodic narrative and Brock Sampson naked. That being said, there is still the great writing, although it falls short in the sheer number of the great one liners from the first season. It should be said that the packaging on this set is great - the artwork is wonderful. I would have prefered more more extras - but any fan always does. So why do I still give it 5 stars? Because even when this sputters, it still stands as some of the best work of TV. My ( unsolicited ) advice for season three? More of the action adventure 50s/60s men's magazine, tongue and cheek goofiness that makes the Venture Bros so fun to watch, and that makes you feel so smart for doing so.",1179100800,,1886,4.547058823529412

2726758,5,B000M7XRC4,"Seems Adult Swim made the right choice to renew this show for another season, as this season contains some of the funniest and craziest material I've seen in years!...considering how much sluggish comedy makes it on TV and in the theaters these days.

Here are my thoughts on all 13 half-hour episodes of this set:

Powerless In the Face of Death: Great season opener, as you find how the VBs Hank and Dean come back to life (and how they kept coming back to life) after their demise in the end of the first season. Plus the Monarch makes his daring escape from jail with the help of a...gay gorilla? 8.5/10

Hate Floats: Not one of my favorites, but still works. The Monarch makes his return to find an abandoned cocoon lair, and almost all of his henchmen departed and moved on. 7.5/10

Love Bheits: Disturbing, but hilarious. On the way to a costume party, the Venture family crashes into Underland and its head-honcho, Baron Underbheit, holds them hostage and plans to marry Dean, whom Underbheit mistakes in Dean's Princess Leia costume for a woman. 9/10

Escape To the House Of Mummies, Part Two: One of my four favorites from this set. After abandoning Brock and the rest of his family from a big ""two-parter"" adventure, he makes a bet that he can preform a task--shrinking--better with science than Dr. Orpheus can with magic. Pure hilarity. 10/10

Twenty Years To Midnight: Another one of my favorites, Dr. Venture reluctantly teams up with his brother Jonas Jr. to put together the four pieces to his father's ""greatest invention"". Fun from start to finish, as I love the character of Jonas Jr. This also contains my favorite Venture moment: Jonas and the ghost pirate captain encounter a middle-aged drug addict Johnny Quest (""WHOOOAAA!! Don't you talk about my father! OOWWWW!!""). Not to mention the returning debuts of the Impossible family and the ghost pirate captain, and a ""Contact"" spoof. 10/10

Victor. Echo. November: Lots of things happen in this episode: Dean and Hank on a date with Triana and a ""surprise date"", Dr. Venture renting the worst porno ever (in some of the episode's weakest spots), and Phantom Limb trying to impress Dr. Girlfriend by sending a fierce army to the Venture industries with hilarious results. (7.5/10)

Assassinanny 911: This explores Brock's past, and how he met mercenary Molotov C***tease. Brock puts Molotov in charge of guarding the Venture family as he hunts down an old friend of his. On a sidenote, Hank develops a crush on Molotov. 8/10

Fallen Arches: Dr. Orpheus is one of the best characters of the show, and this is my favorite story about him: Dr. O. realizes that he has a lair-screening from the Guild of Calamitous Intent, and all he needs to do is to bring back the Order of the Triad he'd departed 16 years ago. 9/10

Guess Who's Coming To State Dinner?: Heard this is one is the most underrated episode of this season. I think it's pretty funny. While in the Venture family's visit to the White House in reluctant celebration for a survivor of a spaceship crash, the ghost of Abraham Lincoln tries to foil a plan to assassinate the president with the help of Hank and Dean. 8/10

I Know Why The Caged Bird Kills: The third of my four favorites. The secret about the Ventures' mother is revealed as a mysterious man helps the Monarch in organizing the cocoon and #21 and #24 and not liking the changes one bit. 10/10

Viva Los Muertos!: Yes! I've been wanting to see the dull Scooby Doo gang wickedly satirized, and now my prayer has been answered! To bad it's just a B-story. The A-story involves Dr. Venture playing Frankenstein as he resurrects a dead corpse Brock has recently killed, and Brock not like himself since the resurrection. While having a disturbing hallucinogenic scene involving Hunter, this marks the fourth of my four favorites of this set! 10/10

Showdown At Cremation Creek, Parts 1 and 2: Having these two episodes together alone will make a great season finale, as it contains hilarious moments throughout, secrets revealed, action galore, and a great cliffhanger that'll set the stage for the third season opener. 10/10

An excellent season, by and large. In addition, all 13 episodes are presented in Dolby 5.1 surround as they contain commentary tracks by the creators of the show. Also included in this set a big batch of deleted scenes, and a neat tour through the studio AstroBase Go!.

2726770,5,B000M7XRC4,"Other reviewers have done a good job of running down the basics of what the Venture Bros. formula is, how this season builds on (and in my opinion is better than) the first, and how it truly is one of the better cartoons currently being animated.

I have much affection for the Adult Swim block, but VB could stand on its own two legs and what's more is almost out of place with more obtuse Williams St. productions.  If you are a cartoon fan this DVD is a must, some of the animation is, unfortunately, still somewhat limited but still enables the creates to tell stories with a broader canvas than if it were live action.

Much credit, if not all goes to the creators, Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer.  These are two adult age lost boys who through this series get to riff on subjects common to just about every adult 25-35 can wax nostalgicly about: Star Wars, wearing costumes, toys, Marvel comics.  At its very, very best VB presents us a world where archetypes like the boy genius, the arch rival, the stony assassin, the mad scientist, lead lives that parallel our own, they endured insufferable college roommates, settled into disillusioned adult lives and banter among themselves the way you would among your own friends.

If you're already a VB fan or are sitting on the fence about buying a DVD of episodes you may have already seen, I would encourage you to buy this volume if for no other reason than for the 'extra' tour of Moon base Astro-base Go.  Far more than padding to round out the DVD, this is a nice look at what the creators can do when not necessarily working to the constraints of the Venture Bros animated world.  It is well written and dovetails perfectly with the tone of the second season and allows a behind the mirror look at the minds behind the show.  Commentary by these guys can be fun or irritating, often shy on productin details it mostly revolves around them discussing the strange and sometimes hilarious stream of consciousness pool of influences that get distilled into the show.

2726777,5,B000M7XRC4,I have seen all of season 2 and it is even better than season 1. I didn't think that it was possible to better the first dvd set but I was wrong! Quite possibly the best thing ever on television.,1170979200,8,195,3.9
2726778,5,B000M7XRC4,"It's a classic that everyone in this planet ought to check out. Although I'm not fond of the computerized graphics (I'm a penciler fan, mind you) that lacks detail, I must say I'm quite fond of the plots and hilarious episodes and thus ignore the art. It's very comical and serves right to be watched by everyone.",1169856000,3,313,4.508771929824562
2726779,5,B000M7XRC4,"A surprise hit in it's first season, Adult Swim's Johnny Quest-spoofing Venture Brothers returns for another batch of hilarious excellence; picking up from the first season's cliffhanger ending.  The last time we saw Hank and Dean, they were, well, dead.  A distraught Dr. Venture is drug back home by a now mullet-less Brock (still voiced by the great Patrick Warburton), as an even more distraught Dr. Orpheus prepares to go into the black arts to bring the twins back from the dead.  The end result is simply hysterical.  After all that, arch enemy Monarch escapes from prison, villains inadvertantly, and inappropriately, fall in love, and dangers abound for the Venture crew.  And, just like the first season, the conclusion of season two of the Venture Brothers will leave you in stitches and begging for more.  Easily one of the best shows to ever grace Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup, the Venture Brothers is still a just plain awesome treat.",1169683200,12,955,4.9748427672955975
