8631136,5,B0000UYXNA,"I purchased this DVD thinking it was going to be a waste of money.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  When you start to watch this DVD you become torn between making an immediate shopping list with a fast track to the store and continuing on to the next desert.  Mr. Nix does a fabulous job of making mouth watering deserts in cast iron pots over an open campfire.  I am fairly new to the dutch oven scene and I am amazed at just how simple these recipies are to follow.  I cooked the coconut macaroon cake for my friends and they loved it.  Many had third helpings.  They couldn't believe that something so good came from some huge black pot cooked outside.  While you are watching this video the viewer gets a glimpse of the other things he cooks that must be on other videos.  Examples like the beef stew that makes you want to reach into the TV grab a bowl or the venison torte.  Man, I don't even know if I like venison but I would surely try that!!  I can't wait to buy the other Campfire Cafe DVD's because I was greatly impressed with this volume!!!!",1125878400,,1058,4.24
