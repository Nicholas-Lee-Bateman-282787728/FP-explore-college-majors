8516079,4,B007FYP5Q8,"While amazon's delivery packaging was good, the actual product packaging had some problems when I opened the cellophane 2 of the 3 DVDs were loose inside the packaging and a piece of the plastic that holds the DVDs in place was broke off and sure enough one of the DVDs was scratched, luckily after I watched it I realized that none of the hooping part was affected by the scratch.

I watched all the way through the first DVD to check on the scratch and thought it was pretty good, moved along at a good pace and was cool to see how they teach all the basics very step by step and detailed for a beginner.  The reason I only gave 4 stars (aside from the scratched DVD) is because what they didn't go into was the Hoop itself.  There are so many different kinds of Hoops out there and for a beginner it can be a bit daunting trying to research it all, so I would like to know more about what they were using and why, etc...Weighted vs. regular hoop? Regular kids hula hoop from Wal-Mart or make your own hoop?  There was one comment about how begginers usually start with a larger heavier hoop, but that was the only comment.  Since I only recently recieved my DVDs I haven't watched the other two (routine or fit) so I am hoping maybe they will go into at least the recommendations of hoops for these DVDs.  Still, I think I will enjoy these DVDs and think it will be a good starting point for my Hooping endeavors.",1401408000,4,1416,4.264925373134329
8516080,5,B007FYP5Q8,"Marisa is just like the girl next door.  I gave it five stars because it is so basic, and that's just what I needed...the basics. I love the fun atmosphere. I love the attitudes. But, again, it is very basic and it really was a perfect fit for my needs as a beginner hoopster.",1387584000,,276,4.111111111111111
8516081,5,B007FYP5Q8,Just looking at Marisa Tomei's body and seeing what she has accomplished using the weighted hoop is inspiring!  Then the instructions are very easy to follow.  I was able to use my hoop within minutes and it is a great workout!  I do suggest using the small hoops for the arms if you are a beginner.  Stronger arms can use the larger hoop.  I have recommended this DVD and the weighted hoop to several of my friends and I had them using the hoop within minutes!  Great Program.,1384041600,4,477,4.363636363636363
