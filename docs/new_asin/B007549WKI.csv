5056750,4,B007549WKI,"You should know that Iron Man is my second favorite super hero of all time.  Make of that what you will, but obviously I am going to show some favoritism to Iron Man products.  Let's just be honest here.

Now that that's out of the way, lets settle something.  People seem to either love or hate anime.  I love anime and have been watching it for a very long time.  If you love Iron Man, but hate anime, don't even bother watching this.
A lot of people on various websites have trashed these Marvel anime just because they are anime.  If anime isn't for you, then these aren't either.

If you do like anime, then you already know that anime is slick and visually stylized.  I has a certain feel or Japanese quirkiness to it, that will be lacking elsewhere.  This anime has that, but brings the fun of centering on a popular super hero that I know and love.  The artwork is nice, crisp and colorful.  It's very pretty to behold.  Of course like a lot of animation in this cost cutting age we live in, there aren't 30 or 60 frames of animation.  Now that things are done on computer instead of hand drawn, companies tend to skip as many frames as possible and often show many static scenes to cut time and expenses in production.  That's just something you have to deal with now.  Anime purists are aware that old school hand drawn anime had a much more fluid sense of motion to it and a lot less of the shortcut method.

None of that has proved to be a bother in the Iron Man anime.  That is partly due to the fact that the episodes are fairly fast paced.  Iron Man is facing dangers very soon.  This is only a 12 episode show and that could be looked at as a good thing.  A lot of anime will do a 26 episode season or series.  Some good much longer and some go way too long.  At least here, you know you're going to get the entire series with one purchase and the show has to come to an end.

So without spoiling anything, I just feel that this is a fun, beautiful, fast paced anime style tribute to a great superhero.  I think studio Madhouse did a great job.  These not a high level of utter silliness that can be found in some anime.  You won't find singing pigs or magical cat girls, so don't worry about that.

At this price, this is totally worth buying if you are a fan of both anime and Iron Man.

For me, the enjoyment of this series has been even more pleasurable because me and about 30 of my friends will be getting together to watch all of the Marvel super hero movies and then going to see The Avengers in the theater the next day.  The Iron Man anime is a fun appetizer.  The rest is dessert.",1335484800,20,2607,4.16432865731463
5056751,3,B007549WKI,"I watched the series when it previewed on G4 and I found that it was not bad. The animation was quite good, and the females in the series are properly proportioned.... you know what I mean X-men.... There is intrigue, betrayal, and action in every episode that I watched. There was even a cameo from another character in the Marvel universe that one will not see coming. Even though I gave it 3 out of 5 stars, I will still purchase this for my Marvel collection.",1334361600,15,463,4.395348837209302

Great story & jaw dropping animation. It's ironic because as much flack as this project got from the get go, growing up a comic fan in the 80's to mid 90's we always fantasized to see something like this. And now that it's finally here, fan boy's still find negative things to say. There's just no pleasing some people but to the uninitiated, I recommend giving this a chance.

The story has a good arc story line and each episode is well written and animated. I feel that this series shows what can be done with a comic book character.

5056826,1,B007549WKI,"Buyer beware!  This product may not work on your DVD player (yes, even if it's Region 1)!

I use my XBOX 360 to play all DVDs I watch and have never had any problems with disc recognition before.  Given that the discs work fine on my desktop computer, I can only assume there is some sort of short-sighted copy protection scheme on this product that prevents some DVD players from recognizing them.  I strongly recommend borrowing a copy from your public library to test in your DVD player first unless you don't mind spending your dollars on a flawed DVD product.  Truly, this series is so good it's worth supporting the studio in spite of the dysfunctional DVDs.  It is by far the best animated Iron Man series ever produced and I would give it 4.5 stars.

I leave this review as a warning to other prospective customers that the product you buy may not actually work.  Unfortunately there is no other way to get the series; let's cross our fingers for a digital download option, folks!  Or just borrow the DVD players of every friend you've got until you find one that works, because this one is worth watching, Iron Man fans!",1362182400,,1129,4.522167487684729

5056828,5,B007549WKI,"A lot of fun. The Iron Man character lends himself well to the Japanese anime medium, as it's a mechanical suit in the tradition of so many manga and anime anyway. A novelty addition to any Marvel Comic fan's collection.",1359244800,,220,4.525
5056829,5,B007549WKI,"I highly recommend this Anime to any Iron Man fan.  The Japanese art form applied to this character adds to the artistic realm of Iron Man.  It does not detract.  Sure a few small liberties are taken with the origin, but we are all used to that.

It more or less adheres to the past history set forth in the Iron Man movie that starred Robert Downey Jr. including Stark being kind of a smartass womanizer. That aspect is maybe slightly toned down for the Japanese audience, but it is definitely there for the characters to react to.  Although this 12 episode series is OK for kids, this is really geared towards an adult audience with the internal conflicts of the character taking the forefront.

The CGI of the Iron Man suit is a little different ""Mecha"" anime style, but still very nice.  Even so, to me it was still somehow reminiscent of the Adi Granov designs, and some of the flight positions that he drew.

Now about the language - fear not! It is dubbed in English, but you have to choose English from the languages menu. The default is Japanese.  It also offers English subtitles, but as someone else said in these reviews, the subtitles don't exactly match the spoken English.  I suspect that the subtitles were the original script which the voicing actors improvised off of.  I recommend not using the English subtitles, because the spoken English is much better and elaborates a little more.  I thought the performances, particularly of Tony Stark and the Captain were beautifully voiced.

There ARE some special features that come with the 2 disks. Two features on each disk. They consist ""Re-Imaging Iron Man""; ""21st Century Hero: The Technology of Iron Man"" plus two other interviews with Japanese creators of the Anime that are subtitled in English.

If you have never seen Japanese Anime, this would be a good place to start to appreciate it.  The cinematic techniques are interesting in their own right, analagous to the innovative visual techniques used in graphic novels.

Concerning the story arc, I was impressed how very gradually the characters response to Tony Stark changes over the course of the story. Despite all the rough American edges to the un-acculturated Stark, you can see how the Japanese really have an appreciation for Iron Man.  They have done a beautiful job with this Anime.",1357257600,2,2317,4.78140703517588

5056853,3,B007549WKI,"I'm gonna make this short.  It seems that these Marvel animes are following a formula.  The Protagonist goes to Japan, something happens (It's not Godzilla this time), choppy dialog in between, lots and lots of lazy animation when talking, some cool battle sequences, 12 episodes later...it's over.  This isn't a bad anime, but my advice...save your money.  Get it from the library, but hey..if you're an anime lover and you don't care about a good story...this is for you.  I will say this about it..the coloring is fantastic, the character models are really cool and the animation is awesome! (With the exception of the close up on the face/ talking animation.

5056855,4,B007549WKI,"I just finished watching the X-Men anime series and really hated that one. There was no action at all and it was just basically them standing around talking for 19 mins and a minute of them actually fighting something.

Iron Man series does it right. There plenty of action and guess what when they talking they are fighting at the same time. Who knew they could do that. Hint, Hint, X-Men.

I like how all of Iron Man enemies also have armor like him. This makes for interesting fights as they all have different powers and armor like him. The thing is, Iron Man has only a few ways to win his fights. Mostly him just shooting at his enemies with his hand cannons or chest cannon. Iron Man fighting style isn't much as he is always getting hit and throw around quite a bit. It's a really good thing that he has armor on, huh. This is a Japanese anime, so he does know some moves, I now see him know how to do kicks, which he never did before in western shows.

I love the story line and characters. They do fit nicely in this 12 shows series. I do recommend this as a buy.

-----Spoiler Alert-----

Towards the end, I kind of didn't like how they killed off every single character at the end. It didn't matter if they were a good guy or bad guy because they all died. In every last show, it seemed like the writers wrote in one main character would die in that show. I didn't really see the point to doing this. Sure some of the main people could die and that would have a point, but all of them? No that's just careless. Then, at the very end, the only one left was Iron Man himself and the two reporters. Also, the two reporters didn't even know where Iron Man himself was, so mostly they separated and pretty much means they are dead to him anyways.",1340323200,,1753,4.205357142857143

5056857,1,B007549WKI,"For the love of God, don't buy this DVD!

5056859,4,B007549WKI,"I'm not a huge anime fan but when I heard Madhouse was involved in the production of this I knew I had to check it out. For those of you who don't know, Madhouse is a studio that produces many high quality shows in Japan, such as Trigun, Death Note, and Ninja Scroll. It was basically a given I'd have to see this since I love Iron Man and Marvel, so a superhero anime in the hands of such capable talents was bound to be something interesting to say the least.

Since it is an anime, you will naturally see many Eastern influences in the show but they are not done to an extreme that distracts the viewer. There can be some quirkiness in regards to character's facial reactions reacting to things and the physical animations they do when they go about some things but it is nothing compared to your average anime so if you dislike that kinda stuff rest assured it's not overdone. Some people may not even know they're watching an anime to be honest if they aren't too familiar with the style. With Madhouse, I had no doubts the animation would be superb and I was correct; the animations are sleek, the action is easy to follow, and art they used for the characters and backgrounds are absolutely beautiful.

As for the episodes themselves, they're pretty decent and mostly follow a ""freak of the week"" format. Not going to lie, some of the show's villains are pretty weak in their character development; the reasons for their actions are poor, and some are entirely way too generic. There are some really great episodes though and asides from a few that I thought were useless due to the weak villains used, it's overall a nicely paced story with 12 episodes. I think the most notable thing to mention in regards to the voice cast is Adian Pasdar (Heroes) takes a bit to get used to as Tony Stark but he grows on you once you quit imagining Robert Downey Jr.'s voice as Tony's (if you're like me).

If you enjoy anime and Marvel or Iron Man, I can pretty much assure you you'll love this. It's not a full-blown anime but incorporates enough signature qualities of one that you'll be right at home if you're a fan of the style. If you don't like anime, I'd say at least give an episode a watch and see what you think then as it's anime but depending on your definition and knowledge of the animation style, it may not even bother you. As I mentioned earlier, this show does utilize a ""freak of the week"" format in a sense that most villains are connected to a bigger enemy that threatens Tony so if you don't like shows that use this story style you may not care too much for this show.",1336953600,2,2587,4.374220374220374

5056861,2,B007549WKI,"This is nothing more than a very typical and bland anime cartoon with Ironman thrown in. He could have been replaced with anyone and the series would be exactly the same.
I enjoyed the Xmen anime that came out along with this, it was Xmen blended with anime and it was almost a good as any xmen animation ever and certainly different.
Ironman on the other hand is just thrown into japan, surrounded by pointless characters that are staples of every anime ever. The pointless reporter and comedy side kick that has to be inserted in each episode, painful.
And the any other marvel stars? Well just when I thought there was hope, they made the worst incarnation EVER of one of the best heros ever.
The series looks good, not great. I don't think there was one overall start to finish great episode. The whole thing was just too standard, I didn't feel like I was seeing an addition or different take on Ironman, they just stuck him in a regular, subpar, unoriginal anime cartoon.

The writers did a good job with Stark and the Armored Avenger. Try it, you may like it. You get a lot of bang for your buck.",1446336000,,407,4.1
