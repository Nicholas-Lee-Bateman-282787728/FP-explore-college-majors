About a group of factory workers in Turin who go on strike. The film had its premiere at the 35th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party. The script was nominated for the Academy Award. The story of exploited textile factory workers in Turin, Italy at the turn of the century and their beginnings of their fight for better working conditions. Professor Sinigaglia (Mastroianni) helps the workers organize their strike and give form to their struggle.

A record of problems, and an inventory of labour issues, packed in a very convincing, but not supernaturalistic way. A good film.
