8423992,5,B004CYVYYQ,"I watched this with my 11yr old son and some of his friends. Was the monster dog realistic looking? No, but who cares, it was a fun movie to watch with the kids.",1358467200,,161,3.909090909090909
8423993,2,B004CYVYYQ,"MONSTER MUTT looks like a movie from the 60's--from its by the numbers plot to its horrible acting and its laughable monster dog effects.
Small children might get a few chuckles but sane adults will cringe and find something else to do while the kids watch.
I watched the whole thing just to see how bad it was gonna get.  MONSTER MUTT is just a really bad movie!",1300665600,2,363,4.338235294117647
8423994,4,B004CYVYYQ,"Watched with the kids (10 yol daughter, 6 yol son). They were entertained. Lots of luaghs,... they seemed amazed at the impossible and silly situations..... It's a fun fantasy kids movie.

There's not much in the ""special features"" of the DVD. Only a trailer of the movie itself, and ""Behind the scenes"". You can also turn on/off english subtitling.

Possible spoiler alert:....... The ""Monster Mutt"" does not look very realistic,... a bit like a puppet,... made me think a of the big flying dog-like animal in Never Ending Story (tough funier and with lots more energy),... but still good and fun. Perhaps the fact that it's not 100% realisitc even helped with my kids enjoying this movie. Especially my 6 year old. He could relate that it's just ""silly and impossible"".",1294704000,5,771,4.877862595419847
