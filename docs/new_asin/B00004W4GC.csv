7924695,3,B00004W4GC,"Oranges and Lemons, 1923 film

The story begins at a packing house where women pack lemons into crates. Oranges are processed or sorted by a rotary machine. [Oranges are picked green, they turn orange as they ripen.] Men pick oranges from trees. There is humor from swinging doors, and a mistaken identification. [Note the physical humor, needed in a silent movie.] There is humor from a too-full box. Next boxes are sent to the second floor. Running on a conveyor belt for more humor. Escape on a package lift? The lunch whistle ends this fun.

Stan Laurel created a comic situation and designed his gags to fit in, one leading to another, as in this film.",1322265600,,657,4.655172413793103
