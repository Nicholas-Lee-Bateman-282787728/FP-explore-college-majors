8050518,1,B0007QJ1XO,"The movie itself is ""very good"" - 4 stars on the masked lucha cheesy scale.  However, this DVD from Ground Zero is clearly stated to have English subtitles. I don't know Spanish very well, so I bought this version for the subtitles.

Had I known the description was wrong, I would have purchased ""Dos Peliculas Mexicanas - Triunfo De Los Campeones Justicieros Y Una Rosa."" Same film with a bonus Lucha for half the price of this one!",1325894400,2,433,4.538461538461538
8050519,3,B0007QJ1XO,"First, let me say that I love lucha films and this particular series is possibly the most entertaining I've discovered.  The movie itself gets five stars from me.

However, this particular release by Ground Zero has a couple of faults buyers should know about:

1. This release is _not_ captioned, in English or any other language  To be fair, you don't really need to understand Spanish to enjoy lucha films, but based on the Amazon description I was expecting subtitles (FYI: the 'capitulos' in the menu means chapters).

2. Video quality is considerably lower than usual.  There are compression artifacts and other reproduction flaws that are hard to overlook or excuse, on top of the expected graininess and scratching.",1255651200,4,723,5.033613445378151
