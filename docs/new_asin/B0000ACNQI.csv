I wish it was available on DVD though. I highly recommend this movie to everyone that wants to share a faith based message with their children. I haven't seen this movie in 15 years and still remember it like it was yesterday, that's how good this movie is.",1434412800,,411,4.15

The Kids liked and it told a lovely story of what we can accomplish by working together. Wish they had more stories like this.",1392681600,,276,4.12962962962963
7996651,5,B0000ACNQI,"My title says it - you cannot go wrong with these ""Francesco"" movies. We have three of them. Not sure if there are more or not. Had them for our last few years homeschooling and wish we could have had them sooner! My grandchildren have them now and I am going to get what I can to send them to our other little just-about-three year old granddaughter. The songs and the story keep their interest and they seldom tire of the stories, watching them over and over. (I don't mean hour on end; but day by day. 'Tho' it would not be objectionable if this is what they had to watch hour by hour w/o any other!)
  The colors are vibrant and the messages are life-impacting. [Story likeness is from St. Francis of Assissi, I believe.) And the animal friends are incorporated into the story lines and each of our children had their favorite one. A delightful bluebird, a bee, a raccoon, owl, etc. Good for all ages :) and for those wanting some of Jesus to share, this will be a best friend :). Teaches kindness, love one another, love your neighbor, teamwork, obedience, reverence for the Father God, joy, optimism and hope in times of struggle or disaster. The songs are memorable and I found myself singing along :). The 'negative' part of life is dealt with in very teachable manner, allowing folks to realize life is life and we have to meet it with good attitude - my favorite part, I think!

  I am hoping they come out with them in DVD and will enjoy them as long as possible! A very 'profitable investment' in a child's life - or even an adult's!",1359676800,,1545,4.388111888111888
