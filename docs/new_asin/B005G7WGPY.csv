8471393,1,B005G7WGPY,"I love any documentary about the Vietnam war, especially anything about air wars. This DVD is probably the most boring thing I have ever watched. I was expecting so much from this. I couldn't wait for it to arrive. I could barely keep my eyes open. BORING.",1523664000,,256,4.468085106382978
8471394,2,B005G7WGPY,"This video is terrible. It is inaccurate, the narrator made several egregious errors, and the videos used were pathetic. They did not reflect what the narrator was saying and, in at least one instance, used clips from a Korean War movie (Skyraiders from the movie Bridges at Toko-Ri). Those pilots interviewed for this were/are the real deal, but must be embarrassed to be associated with this poor quality, inaccurate flick. Don't waste your time/money.
I am a Vietnam Veteran Army Helicopter Pilot who has read and studied the war extensively since my participation in it 1971-72.",1518912000,,582,5.072916666666667

8471397,2,B005G7WGPY,"They show F-5s several times and talk about F-105s. Additionally, they call the B-52 a name that is not the ""Stratofortress"", but some other name.  While this may appear to be nitpicking, there are several other clips that are repeated throughout the DVD.  At times, I felt like I was watching a DVD loop of the same footage.  The veterans interviewed are the highlight and the heroes of the war, but unfortunately, the producers did not create a quality aviation DVD.",1422057600,3,468,4.753086419753086
