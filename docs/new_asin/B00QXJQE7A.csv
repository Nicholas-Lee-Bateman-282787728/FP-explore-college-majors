8693230,3,B00QXJQE7A,"Deepika Padukone is always a great actress, and was really low key in this one, very natural. Had some funny moments, liked it. Didn't find it going into a 'most memorable movie' category in my movies list, but was enjoyable and a good story. Didn't have the singing and dancing but had a nice soundtrack and mellow flow to it. Glad I saw it.",1465603200,,342,4.359375

8693232,5,B00QXJQE7A,"A wonderful film.  The story was sweet, the acting was good, and overall I think worth seeing.  It is not your typical Indian movie.  Quite the departure from Bollywood.  I enjoyed it and would watch it again.  That is a rare for me.",1446681600,,233,4.325581395348837
8693233,3,B00QXJQE7A,"In its finer moments, Finding Fanny diverts as a quirky character study and as a rollicking road movie. It also drags in spots and, sometimes, the idiosyncrasy falls flat. And yet it's worth a tune in for a chance to check out who's probably my favorite Hindi actress currently, and it's Deepika Padukone. I love that she takes risks in this movie. Finding Fanny is essentially a five character act, but it's Padukone who shines best and most.

In the slow, sleepy village of Pocolim, somewhere in Goa, the old postmaster Ferdie (Naseeruddin Shah), one evening, espies on his doorstep a letter that he'd 46 years ago penned to the love of his life, Stefanie Fernandes. In that letter he'd asked for her hand in marriage. 46 years later he realizes that the letter had never been delivered. What else is there but for old Ferdie, his heart newly broken, to embark on a quest to find Stefanie Fernandes, never mind that he hasn't even a clue as to where to start. Ferdie, a gentle soul, doesn't set out alone. He's joined by four colorful travel companions: a young virgin (Deepika) what's been widowed these past six years, a sullen mechanic (Arjun Kapoor) returned home after making his fortune, a pervy artist (Pankaj Kapur), and the obnoxious village busybody (Dimple Kapadia). The expected stuff unfolds. Long-buried secrets are busted wide open. Grievances are aired. Old wounds are ripped open. And because this is still a comedy, a cat is placed in mortal peril.

This movie is also unusual in that its running time is only 97 minutes long. Typical Hindi pictures routinely play at least 2 hours and, more often, 2 and a half hours. You'd think the abnormal brevity translates to a more focused narrative. Nah. There's a sprawling travelogue feel here, and an episodic vibe. The plot is wafer thin, consisting mostly of the core cast driving around in a run-down vehicle and peculiar things happening to them. And, yeah, there is a whiff of Letters to Juliet. Maybe my biggest issue is that three of the core cast come off as too caricaturish. It's hard to fall in love with them, hard to invest in their respective arcs. The only thread I was seriously interested in was Deepika and Arjun's fractious relationship. I like how that unfolded in unexpected ways, and, again, a basket of kudos for Deepika, that rangy beauty, for being adventurous.

3 out of 5 stars for Finding Fanny. The beats that don't quite work are compensated by the whimsical moments that do. And my favorite scenes simply have to be those moments in which the movie goes for the dark humor  la A Fish Called Wanda. That scene with the cat. That scene with the lecherous painter near the end. The look on Naseeruddin Shah's face when he at last achieves his goal. Never mind that the film's execution ultimately left me wanting, that not all the actors grabbed me, that those tries at being quirky instead end up being merely prosaic. Listen, it's a Bollywood movie that should be lauded for being different and for taking chances. And for those who stay to the end, Finding Fanny builds up to a boisterous third act in which I feel they do get the whimsy just right.

This DVD set comes with two discs. Disc 1 has the feature film (with English sub-titles) and the option to skip to the featured songs. Disc 2 has the following bonus stuff:
