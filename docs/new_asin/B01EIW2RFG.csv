8758880,4,B01EIW2RFG,"Twelve episodes on two discs for the respective formats of DVD and Blu-ray. This is English subbed only. Good voice acting but the presentation of the picture looks a little dated for the year to which it came out. Its a nice story with a pleasing set of events. There is mild sexual humor with a one or two misunderstanding moments in there. Nothing too extreme as far as content rating goes.

A group called the Shepherds use a magic library to read the various outcome of people's lives. They act as shepherds to alter life events for those who they deem will change humanity for the greater good. There is a catch. To join the ranks of the Shepherds, one must be willing to be forgotten by all and become a timeless entity assisting in the lives of others.

Kyotaro Kakei is able to catch glimpses of the future and uses this to save a girl's life on his day at school. This act earns him recognizing by the Shepherd group who want him to recruit him. With a kind nature he lives largely as a loner trying to understand people through books which makes the path opening up to him a very viable one. He teams up with another would-be Shepherd vying for the position he is being offered and in doing so gets a taste of changing people's lives for the better.  An afterschool group forms around him and the girl he saved to complete a special project of making other people happy. Kyotaro struggles with the decision of being forgotten forever as a Shepard to help his friends and countless others or stay with the people he has become attached to. To top that choice off, he learns that one of his friend's life hangs in the balance of that very choice.

Its worth a watch, but perhaps more so on the rental side for most. But if you like kind-hearted characters with sappy moments like I do, this is buy that you can get some good feels out of.",1487635200,4,1847,4.3604651162790695
