8742884,5,B018T43RHQ,"This is one of several video productions by The Institute for Creation Research. Their videos are extremely well done and contain very compelling evidence for a creator.  However, even if you are not a believer in Biblical Creation, these videos are extremely fascinating.  The processes they demonstrate about the function of the human body are truly eye opening.  I was aware of much of these functions in a general sense but the details displayed are pretty amazing.  BTW, buying these directly from icr.org will save you some money.  If you visit their store look for ""Uncovering the Truth About Dinosaurs"" and ""Unlocking the Mysteries of Genesis"".  A series about the universe will be out in about a month.",1506902400,,711,4.983050847457627
