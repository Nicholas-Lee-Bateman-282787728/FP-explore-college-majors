Glad I did no fall prey to the 10 bucks!!",1330992000,3,102,3.9047619047619047
3883589,3,B002A9JXRA,"As a Fan of all things Phantom of the Opera, I've wanted to see this movie since I saw it on Netflix almost a year ago. Unfortunately, it was only available on DVD, so I was not able to watch it, since my family only gets he streaming service. Naturally, when I saw it on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy it.

It met my original expectations almost spot-on. The acting and sound quality wasn't the best, but the story line was decent, if not original. However, when I spent the ten bucks on it, I was expecting a movie longer than 45 minutes, and the price made my expectations for the acting and the locations go a little higher. It was there that I was let down. If you want to see this movie, I'd recommend renting it - ten bucks is double what should be asked for a short film of this quality.",1327276800,,802,4.10828025477707
3883590,1,B002A9JXRA,"I agree completely with Randy Marten's advice not to waste your money on this amateurish production.  Fortunately, I only rented it on Instant Video rather than purchasing it. I didn't have high expectations before watching it, but thought it would at least be entertaining.  It was not.

Everything Randy Marten wrote in his review is true.  I would just add that I could have forgiven the abysmal acting and cheap sets if the story had been at all interesting or original.  This is just a painful, boring crossover fan fiction of Phantom of the Opera and The Da Vinci Code. Even if you love both of those stories, you won't love this one.",1319241600,11,640,4.628318584070796
3883591,1,B002A9JXRA,"...because it's a low-quality, terribly written, poorly acted 45-minute amateur production that adds NOTHING meaningful, original or compelling whatsoever to the storyline of Gaston Leroux's original 1911 novel nor Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 popular musical stage adaptation.

It is just slightly better than if it had been written and produced over a weekend by school children on a cheap video camera for a class project.  And I literally mean that: 6th graders could come up with a more compelling storyline than this movie has, which essentially is a hodge-podge of mostly unrelated scenes that are poorly filmed and edited together, do little to advance the basic ""secret"" of the story, which, once revealed, is extremely underwhelming, leaving me with the thought, ""OK, so what?""

That a modern day cult would kill to keep this secret hidden, which is an integral part of the story, is hardly likely.

I've been a ""Phantom of the Opera"" fan for many years now and admit that I was somewhat intrigued by the other positive reviews of ""Angel of Music,"" so I recently bought a used copy of this DVD and watched it last night, perhaps hoping to be surprised, yet not expecting too much, so my expections weren't all that high to begin with.

But the basic story of this amateurish tripe is absolutely pathetic with no substance or meaningful point whatsoever.  It was a total waste of $10 and 45 minutes of my time.  I even viewed some of the ""features"" on the DVD, and they were even worse than the main production, which is hard to imagine!",1267574400,10,1544,4.80377358490566
3883592,4,B002A9JXRA,"If you are a Phan of The Phantom of the Opera you should consider giving this film a try.

I was happy to have stumbled across the trailer for this film online. As I investigated more of the story, I was immediately interested in seeing the actual movie. After watching it and all of the bonus features, I stand by my sudden choice to buy the independent film.

The story takes an interesting spin with one heck of a twist for the finale!! It is amazing to see what determined people can put together on an independent film budget. Don't expect a Hollywood blockbuster- it is an independent film made by fans of the story of Erik and Christine.

Many fans simply draw doodles or write fan fictions to contribute to the phandom of the Phantom.... ANGEL OF MUSIC takes it a step farther and makes a 50 minute long movie. The DVD is filled with bonus features.

As I've said before, if you're a true phan then ANGEL OF MUSIC is a must see!",1266105600,3,936,4.331428571428572
3883593,4,B002A9JXRA,"To be quite honest, whoever expects a Hollywood epic from this movie will be disappointed. This does not mean that the film is worse than his predecessors or worse than it's successors will be. It is an attempt to show the story from a different angle, and in this, it succeeds.

The main point in the plot is a certain association, or CULT, whose main goal is to keep the secret of Christine Daa's bloodline by any means necessary.

The reporter, Eric Nelson, comes dangerously close to this secret. So close, that the CULT is forced to take action. Eric's ambition ultimately culminates as the events of the past begin to project themselves to present day. Erik, the ""Phantom of the Opera"" and Christine's ""Angel of Music"", is apparently still ubiquitous and he begins to exercise his power over Eric Nelson.

The movie promises to change everything you ever knew about the ""Phantom of the Opera"". However, this promise is only fulfilled if the audience is not familiar with the many versions of the theme. If you are, then it is certainly a new insight and some food for thought. For the connoisseur, however, is not an innovative perspective of the events. The idea that the characters of today parallel the characters of the past is not new. On the other hand, the idea to create a cult that exists to protect Christine's bloodline is a somewhat unusual and different view of things. Unfortunately, this only gets interesting when flashbacks / visions link the events together and seemingly everyone gets a place in history. This leaves the question - and this is certainly not a disadvantage - whether they are really just visions, or if there are some ideas of ""rebirth"" and ""reunion in the next life"" to be addressed. Therefore, there is a lot of room for speculation.

The story, told in 45 minutes, offers new approaches for consideration. The thread is lacking a little, and sometimes the sound quality makes it difficult for a non-English speaking audience to understand the text. But as a whole, the plot is conclusive and the cast is well chosen. In some places, the sound quality and camera work could be better.

The movie clearly derives its quality from the idea of showing things in a different light. Precisely, this is what makes it interesting and worth it, for a connoisseur. For a layman, in matters of ""Phantom of the Opera"", there would be some problems while following the plot because some knowledge is assumed. Therefore, as an introductory film, it is not recommended, especially if you have at least read Leroux.",1249603200,15,2543,4.783599088838269

3883595,1,B002A9JXRA,"Choppy, uneven script, poor acting.  A total bomb.  I would only recommend this to someone who needs punishment. Did I mention it was terrible?",1398729600,3,143,4.916666666666667

3883597,2,B002A9JXRA,"As a ""Phantom of the Opera"" fan, I'm always looking for movies with a ""Phantom"" theme. When I saw the title, ""Angel of Music,"" I was intrigued, since the Phantom is referred as the ""angel of music."" The description mentioned that it would make you rethink Lerouxs's romantic story, so I knew I had to see it. But after I watched it, I was disappointed.

Even though it did make numerous references to the story, I didn't care much for the storyline involving a mysterious cult linked to the novel. The actual ""Phantom"" scenes were OK, but it was like watching a school production. The acting and action (or lack of) was corny.

This version might be better off hiding underneath the Paris opera house or destroyed by a falling chandelier...",1358985600,3,740,4.641221374045801
3883598,1,B002A9JXRA,I did not enjoy this Phan-made film. I didn't like that they kept skipping between past and present. I especially didn't like the whole 'Cult' thing and I especially hated the ending. I much preferred the altenate ending.,1358121600,,221,4.842105263157895
3883599,1,B002A9JXRA,Movies just don't get any worse than this. I had to give it at least one star but it doesn't even deserve that.  The only way you will ever get through this film is to watch the review made by the Phantom Reviewer- he at least made it good for a few laughs and it wasn't meant to be a comedy.,1356912000,2,292,3.7868852459016393
3883600,1,B002A9JXRA,"This was a waste of time. It was an interesting idea at first - A Phantom of the Opera story with a Da Vinci Code twist... But I soon realized that it wasn't worth it.
The acting in particular was atrocious... I wanted to throw tomatoes at them, it was so bad.
I love the Phantom of the Opera (Leroux's book and ALW's musical), but don't waste your money on this; it was painful to watch.",1355443200,2,388,4.118421052631579
3883601,1,B002A9JXRA,"This is an amateur effort that frankly misses on all levels ... the acting is poor, but then it might not be their fault since the script is utterly incoherent.  Neither characters nor even the plot are developed.  MAYBE there is a kernel of a concept here, but despite the obviously earnest and sincere efforts of all involved, it is a total failure on all levels.",1345939200,2,365,4.515151515151516
3883602,1,B002A9JXRA,"When I saw the summary I thought it sounded interesting. I was curious to see why the filmmakers would give Christine Daae's bloodline the importance that it suggested, but the film never offers a sound reason (it does give a reason, but it doesn't justify the importance of the bloodline and why a cult would be so protective of it ... or maybe I missed something?). The acting is wooden and awkward while the script is cringeworthy and the sets are not impressive. I'm not a fan of the use of green screen for backdrops, and this technique is used several times. Overall, it felt like a group of phans wanted to make a film about the Phantom without having a real good reason to do so. I certainly think that there could be much more to the story, and I'm open to believing that Eric and Christine were real people, but this film doesn't add anything to the legend that already exists (outside of the weak bloodline plot).

I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, and I'm certainly not a pro, but I'm familiar enough with the worlds of indie filmmaking and writing to know that this piece dropped the ball before it was ever in the air. I do give the cast and crew credit for putting their resources into this, but the quality of the overall film is just bad all around. If you're already familar with the basics behind the Phantom then I'd say skip this and check out some phan fiction instead.",1344902400,4,1391,4.454901960784314
3883603,3,B002A9JXRA,"Having read the reviews prior to buying this DVD, I knew that it was going to be pretty bad. However, I found that the movie had a few pros and cons to it.

Pros:
-Christine was blonde, as she was supposed to have been.
-They seemed to take aspects of the original novel and put it in the movie. This includes scenes and dialogues.
-Full-faced mask. One of the things that ALW got wrong about the Phantom.

Cons:
-Unless I heard a totally different version of Marguerite's Jewel song, the one in the movie was incorrect.
-The actress playing Christine/Kristin was HORRIBLE. Her voice irritated me, and near the end you can tell that she is looking down at her script.
-Christine is far too old in the past scenes. She was supposed to be about 18.
-The singing was rather bad. Could have been a lot worse, but still.
-The movie played out like a documentary.
-The sets were horrid, and you can tell they edited a lot with a computer, including the muzzle of the gun and the sets of the ""opera house.""

I didn't mind so much the whole ""cult hiding the bloodline"" idea, and if it was done right, it could have been a very good movie. Sadly, it is obvious that this was not a professionally-done movie. As a Phantom Phan, I am very glad to have seen it, and parts of it I rather enjoyed. Other parts, however, made me want to run to even some of the worst other adaptations I have seen.",1331251200,,1382,4.3076923076923075
8359153,1,B002A9JXRA,Total home made by people who want to see themselves on screen.,1521849600,,63,4.333333333333333

8359157,1,B002A9JXRA,"Omg, this was the worst ever. The premise was okay, but the acting, filming and screenplay were the WORST! The sound was terrible, the casting inappropriate. What a waste of everyone's time.",1485388800,2,190,4.96875

8359159,2,B002A9JXRA,"The premise of this movie is decent enough: the idea that there is a 'truth' and need to protect Christine Daae's bloodline secrets. The film seems to imply there is incest in the Daae bloodline but doesn't truly establish if that 'tainted' blood stems from Gustav Daae, or somehow, from Erik. Added to this convoluted story line is the fact the filming is only so-so, sound is decent, acting is sub-par, and all dialogue comes across as forced and disjointed. For any that view this and have actually read journalist Gaston Leroux's ""Le Fantme de l'Opra; The Phantom of the Opera"" (1910) will find this short movie gravely disappointing and extremely error-filled. And, in no account viewed or read by this viewer, has Christine Daae been older than Raoul.

The movie is based on discovering the truth behind Gaston Leroux's words in his novella; however, many things mentioned and questioned actually stem from Andrew Lloyd Webber's 2004 hit movie, ""The Phantom of the Opera"", starring Gerard Butler as The Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine Daae, and Patrick Wilson as Raoul - which was established in his long running theater musical of the same name. One item in particular in this movie is when modern day Eric is heading into insanity and 'becoming' Erik - as Erik, he has written an opera, ""Don Juan Triumphant"". This happens in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical and not in Gaston Leroux's novella, which anyone can verify via either a quick Internet search or by watching the Special Features found on the BlueRay disc of Lloyd Webber's musical. Even a creative retelling such as what was attempted here, should be researched and verify the known facts they are attempting to prove or dis-prove. Inserting the opera ""Don Juan Triumphant"" which is pure Andrew Lloyd Webber and not Gaston Leroux into this account that is claimed to be based on Leroux's words, should be proof positive for the need of research, even in fiction. It must be believable. Claims that the research the modern day Eric was doing, based solely on Leroux's novella, while mentioning music found in the movie version, were enough to suspend any possible belief in this viewer and cause her to lose all faith in any believability of John Woosley's story telling ability.

This viewer happens to be a fan of almost all tellings of Leroux's ""Phantom of the Opera"", from the 1925 version with Lon Chaney as The Phantom to the 2004 version with Gerard Butler as The Phantom, and admits Andrew Lloyd Webber's 2004 movie musical is by far her favorite. This viewer has also read Leroux's novella, English translation. This viewer does not consider herself or claim to be an 'expert' on The Phantom, simply a fan that does devour The Phantom related movies and books, veraciously. However, the movie being reviewed here leaves one wanting in many areas. Therefore, this viewer does not recommend this movie.",1475971200,,2876,4.903490759753593
8359160,1,B002A9JXRA,Frankly the movie PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was better than this and I was very disappointed in finding out this was a not a real writer but just an actor. Weather or not Christine Daaz is real or not is not the issue. The original manuscript  of the Phantom of the Opera was most likely inspired by a true incident and if the Phantom was real in a Opera I am sure there would be records of strange unexplained occurrences written somewhere.,1472169600,,436,4.317073170731708

8359162,1,B002A9JXRA,HORRIBLE! I would ask and believe that I deserve a refund  for this one. Looks like it was filmed in a basement. I have seen better work on YouTube for free. It should have zero stars but I had to give it at least 1 star to comment.,1430870400,,232,3.8333333333333335
