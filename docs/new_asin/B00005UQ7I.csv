7955165,3,B00005UQ7I,"This movie deserve a 3 star Just for the last fight scene.  I've seen better fights using the same kung fu styles.  I though most parts of this movie was boaring, leading up to the ending,,,not to mentioned the remarkably poor picture and sound quality.  I had to force myself to sit through the entire cinematography of this flick,,,,,,,,,needless to say,,the final scene,,sort of compensate.  Definatly worth checking out!!",1147910400,,425,5.115942028985507
7955166,4,B00005UQ7I,"Ok, while if I were simply reviewing the movie it would be more like 2 stars. Some good fight scenes, and a cliche and over-used story. However, the special features are where the DVD really shines. The actor bio's being a definate favorite. For each of the three main actors, there are 5 different clips of fight scenes from their respective other movies. Unfortunately the video quality is terrible, it seems to be ripped right off a vhs copy (not even a super-vhs master...). The audio isn't in as bad of shape as the video, but it seems they didn't clean it up at all. The dubbing is pretty bad, but hilarious at times, with lines such as, ""I like to do it in the dark"". For having purchased it at the low price of 8 bucks, I'd say it's definately worth around that. If not only for the bad dialogue and great extras, then for the last fight in the movie. A really good 2 versus 1 featuring most of the styles that are performed in the rest of the movie. Overall, if you're a hardcore martial arts fan and don't care about video quality or story, definately check it out.",1085961600,,1075,4.326732673267327
7955167,3,B00005UQ7I,"This movie was very boring until the last fight scene. Which is why I gave it 3 stars.  The final fight scene alone I think was worth the purchase, but I think you should rent it first and decide yourself.  The last fight lasts about 15 min and is great because the fighters anounce their styles. They use cobra style, tiger style, tiger claw style, panther style ,rattle snake style and various other styles. Some styles even have a sound of that respective animal. Like when he uses the panther style, you can hear panthers roar. The final fight scene also includes a lot of trash talking which I like. Video was crappy. Some frames were either all black..or all green. I recommend you rent this movie, and fast forward to last fight.",1051315200,2,736,4.526315789473684
7955168,1,B00005UQ7I,"I thought i would take a gamble on this movie. I gambled wrong. I have no idea what the other guy saw to give it five stars. The quality of this movie was atrocious and the kung fu was really sub par. If your looking for a good movie to chill out and watch with some friends try: Master Killer, Fist of the white lotus, 18 fatal strikes or if you can find a copy of Mystery of chess boxing then your in for a real treat. >Peace",1023926400,,427,3.8636363636363638
7955169,5,B00005UQ7I,"This film stars Chi Kuan Chun,the star of countless Shaw Bros. classics. It has a great variety of styles. The technical aspects are terrific.only minor complaint is that it's full screen. It is in 5.1 sound though. A very rare film. The extra features are amazing also. Highly recommended,along with the Wu Tang Clan's other releases like Shaolin Drunkard and Kung Fu of 8 Drunkards.",1018396800,,384,4.923076923076923
