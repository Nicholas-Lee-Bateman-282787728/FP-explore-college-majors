I could not stand to see such a great movie given such a pathetic dvd release. In addition, there is no art work on the cover. It has nothing going for it. Don't waste for your money. My VHS version which I recorded from television years ago is far superior to this rubbish. Amazon should remove this item. A shocker!!!",1305676800,21,484,4.388888888888889
8443347,1,B004VGH4RQ,I am a big fan of Film Noir and have been happy to see rare titles finally surfacing on DVD. The Warner Archive produces great quality tranfers on an on-demand basis and I've been very happy with their service. Because of that I decided to check out the Artflix on-demand DVD's offered here through Amazon but Boy was I disappointed. I only watched about 5 minutes of this DVD and had to shut it off. The transfer is of such a lo-res quality that the image is pixelated and you can see the image trying to fill itself in as it goes along. I will not be buying another from this series and warn others that until they up the quality I would avoid buying these DVD's.,1304467200,26,665,4.244094488188976
