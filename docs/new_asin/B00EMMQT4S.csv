8606897,5,B00EMMQT4S,"I love Isaac Asimov and was a little surprised to realize that this movie was not a direct translation of the I, Robot story. But that doesn't change the fact that it was an excellent story, excellently told.  The blu ray pack is pretty cool as well. Great presentation, great visuals and fun special features.  And this was an awesome price - get it, you'll be glad you did.",1396396800,,375,4.420289855072464
