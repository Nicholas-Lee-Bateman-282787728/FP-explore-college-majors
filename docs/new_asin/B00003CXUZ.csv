1314933,5,B00003CXUZ,"I don't typically like cowboy/rodeo/country-western movies because those types of things aren't really my style. But this movie was a pleasant surprise; I did enjoy the story, and as a film, it wasn't half bad. It may or may not be a favorite in its genre, but I found it entertaining. Sutherland and Thomas play Hank & Eli quite well, and as usual Daryl Hannah is perfect in her role (who, fittingly, is a vegetarian). Molly Ringwald, I'll admit, did seem a tad useless as the movie went on--not Ringwald herself, exactly, but her character's importance. As far as rodeo movies go, this is a pretty cute one. Celia does sort of fall out of the story too fast, and the entire sad ending is focused on--to me at least--showing the absurdity of riding an animal who can kill you, as a sport. It destroyed not only the dead rider's life but his family's too. Thankfully the bull goes free at the end and does not have to pay with its life for the sad fate of the man.",1120262400,,964,4.391061452513966
1314934,2,B00003CXUZ,"This movie could have been so much more than it is. It offers up more wasted potential than an ""American Idol"" audition.

First, there's the angle of the absent father. While we're thrown some teasers - and even a pseudo-reunion between him and Ely - we are not ultimately emotionally satisfied with the outcome. There's no real resolution, no deep truth.

Then there's the angle of the ""love triangle."" This never took off, simply because Celia and Hank had no further interaction once she and Ely took up together. And then, Ely parted ways with her entirely. Through all this, Hannah delivers no stunning performance. Her character is fairly two-dimensional at best.

And then there's the ""drive to win"" that Ely is supposed to evince. This never really appears. We're just supposed to understand how driven he is by his brooding looks and foolhardy acts.

I will give kudos to the slow motion filming sequences in the beginning and the end. They are affective. However, we could've done with a little less bull drool flying through the air like a trapeze act.

All in all, this movie is plagued by wasted potential. The waste of Molly Ringwald's character is especially troubling. Why even introduce her, if she isn't going to play a pivotal role in what happens with Ely and Hank? A lot of this film seeming plodding and pointless.

I wanted to like this movie. I truly did. I'm a whopping huge PBR fan, and desperately wanted to like this movie. However, the movie itself prevented me from doing so.",1112227200,2,1505,4.747126436781609
1314935,5,B00003CXUZ,The ending was sad but at least Marcus Thomas didn't die. Marcus Thomas was the cutest in the movie though.,1086220800,,107,4.4
1314936,2,B00003CXUZ,This movie could had been better had it offered an interesting story and better acting. The only one into this project is Keifer Sutherland. The others basically coast through their parts. Darryl Hanna is virtually non-existent and Molly Ringwald does not have much to do. The ending makes no sense either. It does give you some sense of how hard (insane) the whole bull riding thing is but that does not make up for the film's serious defects. I want my 100 minutes back.,1084752000,2,472,4.630952380952381
1314937,5,B00003CXUZ,This movie was great in my opionion. It deals with every aspect of being in a rodeo and being a cowboy. I love this much as much as 8 Seconds. Their both great! The ending is VERY sad and yes I shedded some tears....if you can't handle seeing some extremely saddening part this movie isn't for you.,1079222400,3,298,4.245614035087719
1314938,3,B00003CXUZ,"This is a good movie, yet it is kinda hard to explain. I will admit that this in not a movie for those of you who always need tissues during an emotional flick. A great supporting cast makes for a good performance though. So if you are the cowboy type or like rodeo movies then i would suggest watching this.",1077494400,3,308,4.15
1314939,4,B00003CXUZ,"I enjoyed seeing other dimensions of Darryl Hannah, Kiefer Sutherland and Molly Ringwald. The experience was like looking into a parallel dimension. I also enjoyed learning about the world of bull riding (even if fictionalized). In my opinion the star is Marcus Thomas whose performance makes the show a lot more than Hollywood Does Country. I also enjoyed the little touches of country living authenticity like Connie's home and the ranch. The pace of the story let me take in all the details. There's enough bull riding, fighting and intrigue for variation. I enjoyed the slow motion. I've watched TV bull riding events and it's over too fast to really see anything. I recommend this for couple viewing. A nice romance, a good ending and some necessary roughness. Oh, and good music.",1053043200,6,785,4.954545454545454
1314940,5,B00003CXUZ,"The marketers positioned this movie as a love triangle between sibling rodeo cowboys (Kiefer Sutherland and Marcus Thomas) and a girl (Daryl Hannah), which is about as wide of the mark as missing the broad side of a barn. The key character who drives these brothers apart is their father, a champion bull rider, long retired, and long absent from their lives, played terrifically in a cameo performance by British actor Pete Postlethwaite. The old man gave all his attention to the one who took after him and scorned the other, who had the more tender heart. Then he left home, at the wrong end of a shotgun, pointed at him by the boys' mother, played wonderfully by Melinda Dillon. But his impact continues to be felt.
Both boys grow up to become bullriders, like their father. Only one (Sutherland) opts out and turns his talents to being a rodeo clown (bull fighter) and raising rodeo stock, specifically a fierce bull that no cowboy can ride. Like the old man, the bull does his damage, but not before one of them has suffered a near-fatal accident after being named Rookie of the Year and then returns to the circuit against the wishes of brother, mother, and girlfriend (Molly Ringwald). Celia (Daryl Hannah), a barrel racer figures in there rather briefly as one of several things that estrange the two brothers. There's also pill popping, groupies, and angry outbursts. The two men are finally reunited and reconciled at the national bullriding finals in Las Vegas.
From what I know of rodeoing, and it's not extensive, the representation of life on the circuit is pretty accurate. The slow motion photography used to heighten the dramatic tension during the rides is realistic only if you think of it from the perspective of the riders themselves, for whom eight seconds can surely seem close to an eternity. There's some depth to the script, and scenes are played in a way that let the characters seem more three-dimensional than your usual cowboy-hero movie. Sutherland, in fact, is interesting to watch as a self-conscious man who goes all clumsy around a woman he'd like to impress. Thomas needs only to look lean, a little haunted, and good in a pair of wranglers to convey the troubled, driven man who cannot stay away from a sport that has already nearly killed him. And he does all that nicely.
Compared to a rodeo movie like ""8 Seconds,"" about real-life bullrider Lane Frost, this one is not so predictable, a little grittier, less sentimental, and it doesn't go overboard in glamorizing rodeo. Here, for instance, the lovers split up and stay that way. In Garth Brooks words, ""that damned old rodeo"" takes its toll on everyone.",1045872000,24,2646,4.792122538293216
1314941,5,B00003CXUZ,"I highly recommend this movie. It is really good and the two main characters are Hot. I love Ely !!!! This movie has it all, the ups, the downs, and the dramas of rodeo.

1315473,4,B00003CXUZ,"This one took me by surprise. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I thought, oh, this is just going to capitalize on every silly cowboy/Western stereotype out there, and once it started, it seemed like it was actually going down some smarmy love triangle road, but ultimately, it wasn't either of these. Yes, there was plenty of good rodeo action and a little romance sprinkled in, but mostly, this was a story about family and about maturity--about what kind of person do you want to become? It never sagged and kept me engaged, and while the ending was tough, I loved it. I do recommend ""Cowboy Up""!",1432857600,,600,4.669811320754717

I see this title 'Cowboy Up' and you know the first thing that comes to mind is "" This has got to be good""!! The people who brought us this film should be sooo thankful and grateful that they could use such a title ! ( I do have a lot to say about this film but I will try and keep it short ).---  I think that Woody Harrelson  would of made a much better Ely - who was played by Marcus Thomas . The bottom line for me was that Marcus Thomas just can not act !! Plain and simple !! He must be related to the Director or Casting agent .  He destroyed this film ! -- They rest of the crew was just about average . Maybe a B- or a c+ . But whatever !! -- I could not stand watching this guy . -- I had just watched 'The Cowboy Way' with Kiefer and Woody . That was very entertaining . They 'clicked' together . (makes me wonder what Kiefer was thinking when being paired with this rodeo clown). --- So There it is --- This film  , with such a great title , was a big let let down due to the acting . I could swear that Marcus Thomas MUST have great connections!!-- And it also seems like that the production company was running out of time and money .

1315747,2,B00003CXUZ,"Young Ely Braxton (Marcus Thomas) is an up and coming rodeo bull rider who suffers a movie opening Serious Injury.  Brother Hank (Kiefer Sutherland) is the responsible older brother who raises bulls, teaches a zen-ish style of bull riding (`Empty your heart of hate before you ride,' that kind of thing) and is a rodeo clown - the fellow who distracts the bull after its thrown his rider and, reasonably enough from the bull's point of view, wants to crush into pulp the prone body of the thrown rider.

 I've kind of made a point of searching out and watching rodeo movies.  There aren't a lot of them, and most concentrate on the maverick qualities of the rodeo rider.  Always a bull rider, by the way.  Most, too, feature some heavy hitters - guys like Steve McQueen and Cliff Robertson - in the lead roles.  COWBOY UP is a little different.  Bull riding is more of a backdrop here, a setting against which sibling rivalry, a search for a lost father, and some sticky romantic entanglements can be played out.  Not that we don't get a LOT of slow-motion shots of mucus draining bulls bucking and snorting and doing their best to toss and trample their tormenters (again, `tormenters' from the bull's point of view.)  It's just there's a whole lot more soap than horse in this opera.

 Which wouldn't be so bad if the second lead, Marcus Thomas, was a polished actor.  Unfortunately his one expression seems to be that of stunned introspection, as thought on the first day of the shoot a crew member had asked him a preposterous question that he couldn't get out of his head.  Thomas is talking to a grip, say, on that first day, and the grip wonders out loud whether birds would have to fly if they had opposable thumbs. Thomas guffaws, of course, but every time the studio lights fire up the question returns to gnaw at him, and when he should be `in the moment,' or whatever it is actors say, with movie girlfriend Connie (Molly Ringwald,) instead he's picturing a southbound autumn highway with clusters of hitchhiking ducks.

 I'm not sure it matters, anyway.  The story's kind of an ill-fitting hybrid to begin with.  Things become more complicated later when young Ely hooks up with pretty rodeo horse rider Celia Jones (Daryl Hannah,) brother Hank's old flame, which supplies just enough plot to propel the film to the grand finale.  Ely's search for his missing father is resolved, although that search was so unstressed in the movie I didn't even realize it was a Big Issue until it was on me.  And, of course, as in almost all rodeo movies, Ely gets to ride the big bull, preferably the one who threw him earlier.  In this case the big bull is Zapata, one of brother Hank's bulls, in fact.

 I've never been a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but he's great in this one.  Ringwald, Hannah, and Melinda Dillon - the mother in both `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and `The Christmas Story' - are wasted as sideline fodder who have little more to do than seduce or wring their hands and hope Ely gets some sense and give up the bull riding.  The highlight of the movie for me came when, while Hannah and Thomas were deep in their fling, Ringwald and Sutherland shared a piece of consolation pie at the local diner.  Ringwald, inevitably I guess, says to Sutherland, `In a different world you and I would have made a lot more sense.'  Hey, Molly - in a different and better movie you and Sutherland would have made a lot more sense, too.  COWBOY UP might appeal to hard-core rodeo fans, but the rest of us would be better advised to steer clear of this one.",1155427200,3,3568,4.5328125

7918289,3,B00003CXUZ,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2001 and directed by Xavier Koller, ""Cowboy Up"" concerns rural California brothers in the tough rodeo business: Ely, the younger brother, is a banged-up bull rider (Marcus Thomas) while Hank is a rodeo clown/contractor (Kiefer Sutherland). The former is romantically interested in a vet assistant (Molly Ringwald) while the latter has his eyes on a rodeo barrel racer (Daryl Hannah). Melinda Dillon plays the brothers mother at their ranch. Russell Means, Bo Hopkins and Pete Postlethwaite are also on hand.

The film was meant to debut in theaters in 2000; and then early 2001. It was stuck on the shelf due to the distributor going bankrupt and was eventually released to video in late 2001. As an intended theatrical release, the film has polish, which can be observed in the haunting opening bull riding sequence. The story, however, is akin to the typical Lifetime flick, except mixed with stunning bull riding sequences.

Its interesting seeing Ringwald 12-15 years after her halcyon years as a teen icon in the mid-80s (I much prefer her here as a woman). Despite the prevalence of country tunes on the soundtrack, the creators wisely throw in a couple of rock ditties, like the kinetic Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo (1974). The movies decent, I generally enjoyed it, but I wouldnt recommend it, except to fans of the cast or rodeos.

The Braxton Ranch in the movie is actually the abode of Gary Leffew, the Rodeo Hall of Famer.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour 45 minutes and was shot in Santa Maria, California, and Las Vegas. WRITER: James Redford.

7918294,4,B00003CXUZ,"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that had a complete twist at the end that takes you by surprise. The entire film was set up leading to an obvious conclusion and then BANG!!!, an entirely different outcome. It was enjoyable to watch all of the old favorites from the 80's. Keiffer was wonderful as the older brother keeping everything together, Molly Ringwald looked like she hasn't changed since Sixteen Candles and I was reminded why I never really liked any of the characters that Daryl Hannah played. But that aside, the story was an incredible look into the brave boys who are in the rodeo circuit and how dangerous their lives really are. Entertaining and a good story overall, we enjoyed it.",1485907200,,711,4.650793650793651
