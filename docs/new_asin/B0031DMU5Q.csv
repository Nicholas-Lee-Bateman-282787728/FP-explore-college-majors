8386892,5,B0031DMU5Q,"Such an entertaining series and such a shame it was cancelled as I saw so much potential in ongoing story lines. Debra Messing is pitch perfect in this role that calls on her to be comedic, serious, appealing, fashion savvy, down to earth and, most of all, intelligent. Really a multifaceted personality who most women would love to have as a friend. This is Messing's forte so if you're a fan like I am, buy it even though it's an unfinished story. The last couple of episodes wrap things up pretty well, though, like a really nice lunch at a great restaurant, you'll wish for more of the same for dinner.",1457308800,,606,4.468468468468468
8386893,5,B0031DMU5Q,"This series was cancelled way too early - the story of a woman whose wealthy husband goes off with a younger gal.  It's well written, funny - a ""gals"" show.  You'll love it!",1427414400,,173,4.212121212121212
8386894,4,B0031DMU5Q,"This is very light fare, lots of fun, if you love Debra Messing, and who can resist?  I've lent it to all my friends for relaxing downtime enjoyment.  You find yourself smiling right along.  She has, of course, a gay friend who is, of course, so funny.  She has an ex you love to hate.  She has clothes you love to look at.  Judy Davis and Joe Mantegna are here too - a couple of accomplished actors.",1392508800,3,400,4.12987012987013
8386895,5,B0031DMU5Q,"the series did not last very long, but the miniseries was very good and funny.  Personally The series  I thought didn't have far to go before getting too ""corny"" yet what was produced was good in the acting and dialog. Debra Messing is one of my all time faves.",1373241600,4,261,4.3061224489795915
8386896,5,B0031DMU5Q,"Both the DVD and the book by author Gigi Levangie Grazer are entertaining; filled with subtle and not-so-subtle social satire of the elite in Hollyweird and wherever the air is rare.  The rich (and famous) really are different from us, thank you F. Scott Fitz.  More's the pity that this series was not picked up, as we could all still be enjoying it immensely.
