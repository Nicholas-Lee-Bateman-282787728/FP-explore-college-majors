but the real format was  a cross between 4.3 and 16.9. But the story was very good.",1386979200,,167,3.911764705882353
8436151,4,B004MNW8E2,"The multi-talented Faruk Kabir is the writer, director as well as the actor. Sharman Joshi, who was part of last year's super success 3 IDIOTS, and a powerhouse of acting, Naseeruddin Shah are also part of the ALLAH KE BANDAY cast. Infact the highlight of the film is Sharman Joshi, best known as a comedy actor and charmed with his chocolate boyish looks, playing gangster for the first time. This is also the first time we see Sharman in a rugged appearance, in a noir style.

Set majorly in the slums of Mumbai, the film instantly reminds one of the Oscar-winning SLUMDOG MILLIONNAIRE. One has to say, the portrayal is much more real this time around.

Without wasting any time, director Faruk Kabir draws you into the story. You are absorbed into the world of Vijay and Yakub right from the word go with many gritty moments.",1300579200,,828,4.625850340136054
