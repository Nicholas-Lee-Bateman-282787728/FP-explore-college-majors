174633,4,0987086901,"I am a little disappointed that there is no interview with any recovered patients or any testimonials that convinced people that ther CURE is obtained by any real people. No doubts the video presented many truth and facts but ultimately if I want to convince any of my cancer friends to give alternative a good look or try, they must be convinced that there are people who did it and survived, this is lacking in the video here.",1308614400,35,428,4.5

Being a cancer survivor with mainly natural means I thought that I had learned all there was about cancer and its treatments. Turns out I had only scratched the surface. Not only does this documentary contain a vast amount of knowledge it is also presented in such a way that even my 15 year old Granddaughter watched the entire documentary with me and didn't once get bored. It even contains funny animations which are entertaining and very memorable.

Recommended",1307577600,39,722,6.078431372549019

174636,5,0987086901,"Like most things in life, if we go to what God has provided, we will prevail.  This DVD should be seen by every person diagnosed with cancer.  Perhaps everyone before they get cancer!  We are what we eat.  There is hope.  What is happening to all the billions of dollars put into cancer research?  Surely they would have found a cure by now.  Why don't they?  Well, it's simple, the billions of dollars made on the cancer treatment now available and the billions they raise.  Wake up people.  Follow those brave doctors and nutritionists who have the answer.  This is an amazing DVD.",1395619200,4,583,4.563106796116505

The book is great, but I like seeing and listening to people who really know talk about the different aspects of cancer and offer practical ways to approach it with or without standard treatment.

174642,1,0987086901,"The sole purpose of this DVD is to frighten the sick and vulnerable away from medicine and into the hands of profiteering quacks. To answer another commenter's compalint: of course there are no testimonials. If you have cancer and don't seek proper medical treatment, opting for so-called ""alternative"" therapies like coffee enemas and weird diets, you stand a very good chance of not living long enough to regret your foolishness.

174643,3,0987086901,"I liked the movie, but it wasn't what I was looking for, I wanted something more in-depth, and the movie offered very basic information, too much information but still very shallow, for example, when it comes to diet, they were talking about good diet, but nothing in specific. I would recommend this movie for someone still new to the concept of natural healing for cancer, as it offers too many ways and different theories for the cause of cancer and healing it naturally. still, this DVD is valuable.",1368489600,,503,4.7272727272727275

Although I don't agree with everything in this documentary, I would recommend it to anyone who has a loved one that has cancer or anyone who is suffering from cancer.",1341273600,,404,5.044776119402985
174648,4,0987086901,"Here is a short list of the complete picture of it...

Main Solution:

1- Gerson Therapy (Fresh-Raw-Organic Diet)
2- A good Nutritionist/MD hybrid supervision and monitoring
3- Maybe Specific Vitamins (for the ones that are very low)

Supplements:

1- Transfer Factor
2- Marine Phytoplankton
3- Probiotics

THAT IS ALL THE VERY BEST TO FOLLOW

After all diseases are gone the person should go with at least 51% fresh-raw-organic food from the plant kingdom next to the piece of meat if they still want to eat some meat and pizza.

A minimum of 51% in your stomach should be that, now remember that veggies look bigger in the plate than in the stomach, but juicing them and drinking them with meat or pizza (after all disease are gone) is much easier to get full at 51% the good stuff and 49% the bad stuff. 60% the good stuff its allot better. However people claim eventually you don't want the bad stuff anymore.

Movies that show how its done instead of talking about it:

1- Simply Raw - Reversing Diabetes in 30 Days
2- Fat Sick & Nearly Dead

Other 5 Star Movies:

1- Food Matters
2- Hungry for Change
3- Dying to Have Known
4- The Gerson Miracle
5- Killer at Large
6- Food Inc
7- Vegucated",1338422400,28,1195,4.486111111111111
174649,5,0987086901,"This film presents compelling leads for anyone's own research that hasn't already locked themselves into the ""established cancer treatments/protocols"". There are many healthcare practioners, nutritionists, M.D.s, and other professionals in this video that provide plenty of alternatives to research - there is no way around the work in researching yourself other than recommendations from those you trust beyond any doubt and following their suggestions. The politics involved in the ""Sickness Industry"" today is beyond what most could imagine - start with researching that and you'll then have incentive to dive into researching the rest!",1332979200,,639,5.808510638297872
174650,5,0987086901,"I have watched every DVD on cancer made for the lay public I can get my hands on, including some of the more technical ones such as Nicholas Gonzalez explaining enzyme therapy.  This is the video I would suggest people start with.  Many of the videos out there expend a lot of effort knocking down the mainstream cancer establishment...and while my second favorite is Healing Inside Out, it spends more time on the negative than on offering insight into how cancer is caused and how and why integrative and natural therapies do indeed reverse cancer.

Cancer is Curable Now covers the broad spectrum of issues involved in cancer, and provides details about what can be done.  My only caveat is that it is long...it can be overwhelming if viewed in a single sitting, so I suggest breaking it into two parts.  It begins with an overview of the problem and does cover the major issues at hand with mainstream oncology.  But then it moves to interviews of providers who are the top of the field in treating the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of the disease.  It emphasizes well the need for follow up care and a permanent change in lifestyle.

Highly recommended.",1319760000,44,1170,4.729064039408867

174654,1,0987086901,"The video gives advice already well known to most cancer suffers who use alternative treatments such as eat organic raw vegetables, exercise, don't eat sugar or processed food etc.

Go to a doctor in Denmark.

Get hyperbaric treatments.

Take supplements. They don't tell you all the ones to take but a few days later I got emails for miracle supplements. They say take lots of vitamin C.

I paid for a video that gave me limited information they got a bunch of emails from others seling cancer cures. One was in this video. He was a retired colonel.

This was a waste of money and now I'm on a list with some probably charlatans sending me cancer cures.

This video doesn't give you specific cures for your cancer only they tell you there is a cure somewhere and to follow some general advice.

I wish I could send it back for a refund.",1310256000,56,837,4.431372549019608

Clearly shows that we are being murdered at an unprecedented scale and not just US, OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS are also being genetically damaged possibly beyond repair. Makes me wonder if Neanderthals were a by-product of previous science gone wrong (like ZIKA).
The question is WHY are they reverse Terra Forming this planet into one which will become like Mars or Venus? Because if you have any kind of intelligence, THAT is where we are headed and the morons running the corporations seem too stupid to see it.

100 years ago autism was less than 1 in 150 children, 300 years ago it was virtually unheard of, today it is 1 in 68 and within 20 years it is predicted to be almost 100% of children born after then. Males seem to be targeted more than girls which should raise alarm bells if you understand what EUGENICS is. (1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls - circa March 2014 - source cdc.com)

Cancer, before sugar was discovered was almost non existent, within the next 30 years cancer is expected to hit 1 in 3 people.
Sugar, GLYPHOSATE, Corn syrup (HFCS) , Chlorine, Fluoride are the main contributors to cancer and neurological damage yet the MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT does nothing and says nothing because it will interfere with their income.
In Australia (circa 2016), it is estimated that 130,466 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed (72,048 males and 58,418 females). Again a disproportionate number of men.
Ancient Egypt has supplied many hundreds (even thousands) of mummies. Researchers at the University of Manchester's KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology in England, reached a conclusion in 2010 that they had finally discovered a mummy which showed signs of cancer. - This is a long way from the massive rates of cancer we see today.

Fluoride (classified as both a medication and toxic poison used in rat poison) - and which is proven to cause neurological damage to the fetus, as well as children and adults AND SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NO benefit in stopping or even inhibiting tooth decay. The fluoride dumped into our water is a toxic byproduct from Aluminum (which is not what most stupid dentists will tell you - why ? = $$$).

I've found from personal experience that MOST people, when told they have a year to live, give up, refuse to change, refuse to research and learn, and go quietly into the long night. So, until you know the person this will help has decided to fight for their life and actually wants a cure, there isn't a lot that will help. And, there's not a lot of an attention-grabbing nature in this one to make that inner change happen. Don't get me wrong--the protocols talked about here will save lives--but there is no detail in this DVD, and it doesn't push for the drastic change in perspective needed to regain a life from cancer.",1409097600,4,993,4.745664739884393
