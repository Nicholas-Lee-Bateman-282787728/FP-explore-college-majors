8323112,5,B001N3BD0O,"It's packed with just 1 disc in 1 normal case like the others, but picked by the creators, it's all of the best, top rated episodes of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! This disc has about three or four more episodes than a normal disc would, so its running time is up to approx. 135 min...just to point out.
But as far as every episode goes on this DVD, I personally thought some did deserve to be ...the ""best"", and that some didn't. But it's YOUR opinion that matters when buying this.
So overall, it's a brilliant handfull of SMB Super Show episodes! :)
Enjoy!",1344729600,,564,4.330188679245283
8323113,5,B001N3BD0O,"I have 6 y/o twin Grandsons who absolutely love everything Mario! When I am busy, especially getting dressed for church on sunday mornings, they watch Mario and I am not constantly interrupted by them. They rush to get dressed for church without argument so they can finish watching. They know all the players, songs and tell me what is going to happen next since they have seen it so many times. They are safe for them to watch with no bad language, etc. Love them.",1284940800,,466,4.4941176470588236
8323114,1,B001N3BD0O,Just as a warning for those wanting to buy this.  My parents bought this for me for Christmas (I think from the local Target) and I just want to warn everyone that this dvd does NOT have the live action scenes that starred Captain Lou Albano and Danny Wells.  It's as if those scenes have been removed.  They also are not there in the opening song dancing around like they used to be.  However Captain Lou Albano is still there for the ending credits.,1261699200,,451,4.333333333333333
