8709265,3,B00V5A1HH4,"Rush fans know the story of Rush in Rio - how it was recorded. It will never be the world's greatest sounding show. It was stormy, equipment went down and they had to compromise. That said, this historic concert is presented with considerable power, if also with a lot of grit and a lack of some tones you'd typically listen for in a rock concert. Image quality is so-so also.
So, I've knocked off a star for picture and sound. I've also knocked off a star for the presentation on Bluray. Viewing this side-by-side with the DVD, I see no significant upgrade. Having now upgraded all my Rush concerts that had a BD available, this is the only one that I feel was pointless.
So, if you already have the old DVD set, skip this. If you don't, get whichever is cheapest or otherwise do what makes you happy.",1483401600,9,802,4.389261744966443
8709266,3,B00V5A1HH4,"5 stars for the performance  one of the defining shows of Rush's career, a must-see for any fan and a great intro for new fans as well. But the blu-ray is awful quality, mostly because the show was filmed in standard definition, so it's not an upgrade in quality. If you don't own it, it's worth buying, but if you already own the DVD, the blu-ray is not better.",1473033600,4,362,4.246376811594203

8709268,5,B00V5A1HH4,"Just imagine, 40,000+ people jumping up and down in unison and keeping time while singing the notes to YYZ. Live in Rio is incredible to watch! Needless to say that Rush is great and their shows are phenomenal, but this one stands out as one of their best. If you like Rush, you will love this! A definite must have!!",1466121600,2,317,4.3
