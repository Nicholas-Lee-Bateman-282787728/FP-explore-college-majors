4999877,4,B006JY3OAE,Great forensic feature following cases as our own version of Law and Order.  Fascinating the way the British solve their own way.,1383091200,,129,4.863636363636363
4999878,4,B006JY3OAE,We haven't watched it yet but we believe that it will be as interesting as others that we have ordered.,1381104000,,103,4.2
4999879,2,B006JY3OAE,"The script tries to be clever by using various catch phrases such as ""victim-ology""...etc. as well as background music and camera angles that are obiously trying too hard.",1372291200,,171,5.142857142857143
4999880,5,B006JY3OAE,"This was a really good, gritty crime drama. its shame that there were only two seasons done. The acting and the story lines were not bad while the character development was a bit slow.",1369785600,,184,4.4411764705882355
4999881,5,B006JY3OAE,"I have the first series , I enjoyed it . I am still viewing the second series, so far I am enjoying it.",1363651200,,103,3.5217391304347827
4999882,5,B006JY3OAE,"This one was series two which ran in 2005. the first 8 episodes ran in 2003. This was a spinoff from the bill. the bill ran from 1982-2011! or so. it produced more episodes over a thousand! than any other british drama ever.  For some reason this never got the chance at a third series. It's very slick and fast paced with a cool rock music soundtrack. Itv would later ax many of it's biggest shows due to bankruptcy in the last few years. But at this time , they didn't give this one enough time to catch on. And unlike the bill which had tons of episodes. !,000 + ) this had only 4 hour and half eps in series two. series one had double the episode count of this one. This takes place in london in the mid zeros of course and it's fast and well produced. You can tell it was not a cheapo show. the lowest rating on here for this one is a three star. And I disagree with that. This should appeal to any fan of crime shows. And it even has subtitles if you need them.  This was one of the better more realistic cop shows from the last decade out of the uk. And it's a shame it never had more of a chance. the bill isn't around either now but it had a great run at least! like taggart did.",1344643200,2,1188,3.9665271966527196
4999883,2,B006JY3OAE,"Murder Investigation Team was on TV for 2 seasons. The first season was better then the second season. In the second year they changed characters and the storyline.
The scripts were not well written and very boring. You felt like the writers were plucking ideals from the newsprint and trying to write a script around it. This worked really well for Law And Order because the writing was excellent. In this situation the scripts were uninteresting and did not come together. None of the main characters grabbed your attention. In recent years the quality of the British Detective Series has declined. Unfortunately the Brits have copied more and more the American Style Detective Series format.",1340409600,2,694,5.043478260869565
4999884,3,B006JY3OAE,"They only made two series of Murder Investigion Team in 2003 this one was much better than the first, which I found hard going. When you consider what's available now to watch of a similar nature, I can see why they pulled the plug on this one after two series. It's still worth watching, but well behind TV series, like Above Suspicion and Scott & Bailey.",1339286400,3,356,4.409090909090909
4999885,5,B006JY3OAE,"I watch all the British series like this one, and thought season 1 had so many problems. Too many to go into, but the constant shaking camera trick was enough to make you seasick. Season 2 is totally different, including some of the cast. Now it is first rate. I'm sure that if this series was like season 2 in the beginning, it would have continued for many more years. Too bad they got it right too late, now I want more.",1335139200,12,423,4.170731707317073
4999886,5,B006JY3OAE,"Realistic investigation struggles. Now cop stuff, plus personal issues with MIT racing to solve crime. It explodes with pace and intrigue making 4 thriller episodes filled with police action, raids, chases and arrest struggles. False leads, new suspects, and dead ends cause this team to dig in the London sewer fringe. DI Trevor (Michael McKell) is promoted to Gov while DS Rosie (Lindsey Coulson) is upgraded too. DS Purvis (Richard Hope) is the 3rd cop back. Other regulars are new to the series but keep the same velocity and thrill.

Bonus material confirms the series was shot with High-Def cameras and it matches the technology driven team assigned grisly crimes. Guest stars are included as both good and bad guys/girls. There is occasional sharp wit, but mostly sharper evidence considerations, at least with personal issues are not clouding the moment. That human side of MIT cops is a stronger focus, over Series 1. Office relationships and personal problems form side-plots that carry over from one episode to another. But each episode has its primary brutal death (graphic images) to solve.

Series 2 has four 70-minute episodes...a few guest stars are listed, only some.
SDH subtitles available
1 PHONE TAG: Trevor and team look for an ice pick killer. This and all episodes are shot through with cop jargon. The murder seems to have association with stolen mobile phones and a sordid game of phone tag. Is the victim's father's kidney need a motive? New team player, DC Sharpe (Diane Parish) must prove her worth. Guest stars Kenneth Cranham (Without Motive) and Clare Higgins proves theirs.

2 VIPER'S NEST: Did a favorite doctor jump or get pushed off the hospital roof through a skylight of the canteen? Dr Masters (Anthony Head- The Invisibles) doesn't know, nor care, but does a fine job as guest star. Is there drug dealing afoot? A botched surgery? DCI Wishart (Meera Syal) pushes the team.

3 PROFESSIONAL: Pro footballer [soccer to Yanks] autopsy reveals death by blow to the head. Stalker hate mail and phone calls confirm victim was leaving as a ""free transfer"" [free agent to Yanks]. Was it an extreme fan attack? Team members struggle both personally and professionally-more than normal. Big Bad Mother-in-Law (Rebecca Lacey- The Bretts) and team manager (Tim Healy- The Grand) are suspect, as well as guest stars.

4 SEXUAL TENSION: A woman is gagged and strangled, yes more. Of course an ex-boyfriend is suspect. Then another similar killing. Copycat? Serial killer? CCTV and evidence points to a team member--not good for cop morale.

I liked the reality and the tension/action of the episodes forcing the viewer to literally join the Special Crime Unit's thought process. Even better than Series One.

4999906,4,B006JY3OAE,"Characters in this series grow on you and are pretty compelling.  Plotting is contemporary.  For example, the first episode involves playing an online phone tag game - only the victim really does get murdered.  The pace is fast.  Like the team of investigators.  If you like British contemporary crime shows, you may want to sample this.",1391472000,2,337,4.946428571428571
