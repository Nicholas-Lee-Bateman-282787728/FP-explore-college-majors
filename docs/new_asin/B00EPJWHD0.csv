They did get into some of the heists they did and how they performed some of them, but it showed a lot about Yugoslavia and why/how the thieves got their namesake.  I learned a lot of stuff about Yugoslavia, but for this kind of movie, it wasn't what I was looking for.  I wish they had focused more on the Panthers.  I imagine it would be difficult though, since they only had access to 1 - 2 Panthers, so there's only so much you can get from them.  In the end, unfortunately, I would not recommend this to someone who's a fan a heist films like myself.",1387497600,3,731,4.185714285714286
5933419,5,B00EPJWHD0,"This is an excellent, wildly entertaining documentary that combines good investigative reporting with the high-octane buzz of a top-notch thriller. The world's most notorious ring of diamond thieves has not only been captured on film (the footage from security cameras at several heists gives a visceral idea of just how daring these criminals were), but has finally been infiltrated and interviewed. Don't miss this. Havana Marking is clearly a young director worth keeping an eye on.",1385942400,3,485,5.394736842105263
5933420,3,B00EPJWHD0,"The story is told as a documentary. It includes interviews with the police detectives, a reporter, and two members of the gang represented in animated form. The documentary uses actual file footage from the robberies which are said to be over a 100 valued at $300 million dollars. The robberies took place in Europe, Arabia, and Japan. The crimes in Spain and Dubai are detailed. Jewel thieves like Nissan and Audi S8.

Much of the documentary is a history lesson of Yugoslavia starting with Tito in 1945. The criminals were from Yugoslavia and returned there to avoid prosecution. They used a pretty girl to case the shop before they did their smash and grab robbery. They had it down to a science. 22 seconds in the store. Anything more than that and the risk of getting caught increases.

The documentary was interesting as I was unaware of the police/media named ""Pink Panther"" group. I could have done without the long version history lesson of Yugoslavia. No Henry Mancini.

Parental Guidance: 1 F-bomb. Brief nudity.",1384560000,2,1023,4.867816091954023
8608160,2,B00EPJWHD0,"I am not sure how a movie about some of the most talented thieves in the history of time can be SO BORING. Not kidding, it felt like trying to get through a very slow read. I enjoy documentaries, but i felt like this one was put together in a way that really didn't even peak interest. I rented it after reading about the Pink Panther group in The Culture Code, really disappointing.",1531353600,,383,4.260273972602739

8608162,5,B00EPJWHD0,"Awesome film! I didn't think Mike and Lela were actors, I was sure they are the real Panthers, animated in order to not be recognized!! Wow... They are acting! These guys really do deserve some great reviews! Especially Mike (Actor is Tom Benzon): at times he looks a bit like Tony Soprano with his body language, then has a real Balkan accent, biting his lip...
animation and storyboard/ the plot runs smooth and gives us a very different perspective on the criminal world.
Check it all out yo!:)

8608168,4,B00EPJWHD0,"Whoever heard of Doppelganger Releasing?  Sounds like a bad English translation of a German company name.  Anyhow the BBC was also involved, the copyright is 2013, but the events documented here occurred decades ago.
All this stuff is true.  The gang stole an estimated $300 million worth of jewels from high-end jewelry stores on at least two continents.  They had it down to an art form: no more than 22 seconds from entry to exit from the store.
We learn that many but not all of the gang members were eventually captured.  The filmmaker succeeds (presumably at some personal risk) in locating and interviewing two of them still at liberty, and what they say is sociologically interesting.  This gang arose out of the disintegration and civil war in what had been Yugoslavia, after the death of Tito.  As in Russia, when the regime toppled the country also fragmented, and for a period of time the police, military, government officials and criminals all found it mutually profitable to steal from other countrieswhich is how some gang members never were arrested.  Mike explains, intellectually but with no remorse, how and why the gang came to be.  His former girlfriend, who used to case the joints before a robbery, claims that for her it was never about the money as much as it was love for Mike.  How she kept hoping after just one more, he would quit the life of crime and they could settle down happily and peacefully together.  Eventually, she realized he wasn't going to quit.  How she left him, married, settled down, had childrenyet still, somewhere in her heart, nothing since seems quite as real as the love she felt back then, for a person and a past that no longer exists I give it, maybe A-.  Its like a microcosm for all of human life, from the very personal to the world at large.",1408147200,2,1802,4.6645569620253164
8608169,4,B00EPJWHD0,"""We understood in this time that they were able to do things incredible that nobody had done before"" - Captain Herve Conan.

And all the elements are in place for a well-paced, intriguing documentary on the highly structured and effective international diamond heist criminal organization known as the Pink Panthers.

The filmmakers strike a clean balance of perspective, allowing all the interviewees an equal voice.  We are offered the perspective of the criminals (the main driving story being that of Pink Panther member ""Mike""), the inspectors, and that of a reporter who gained the trust of a few Pink Panthers members who granted her interviews.

The filmmakers could have covered each and every bank robbery through captured news and video footage, traveling down the path of a route bank heist documentary, but this one-dimensional path would have grown tiresome quite quickly.  Instead, we are offered animated sequences of the Panther's personal stories to progress the narrative.  For some, these animated sequences may be a distraction from the live action of the documentary, but given the mystery and secrecy of the Pink Panther's organization, this degree of artistic liberty is both a welcome and necessary technique.  After all, even those who allowed themselves to be interviewed will only divulge so much of their history, and it is this animation that allows for a more illustrated conveyance of the Pink Panthers' stories.

Equally interesting and fascinating is the role of the women in the Pink Panthers, as they are established as the most important part of the organization.  ""They have the leading roles"" and ""have to do the main job"".  From the perspective of a former Pink Panther, Leila, this comes at no small cost...emotionally, physically and mentally.

Also, I have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviews of Smash & Grab, in that I feel that the history lesson of Yugoslavia provides the necessary backdrop for understanding the origin of the organization.  As is so often the case, criminal behavior is exponentially elevated in times of desperation and suffering.  This is accurately conveyed in the coverage of Yugoslavia's collapse, which led to the literal exporting of Yugoslavian criminals into Europe.

Smash & Grab is a highly engaging and well structured documentary, from a blanket understanding of the network structure of the Pink Panthers, to the psychology of all those (interviewed) involved directly or indirectly with the organization.  Although it can only devote a limited amount of time to all the elements of its source material, it beautifully covers the many varying aspects of the world known as the Pink Panthers.

If you're searching for a well-rounded documentary that covers the thrill of the heist while simultaneously exploring the psychology and dynamics of criminal motivations behind the scenes, Smash & Grab is your film.",1388188800,5,2907,5.232758620689655
