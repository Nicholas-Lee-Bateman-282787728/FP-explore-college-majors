At the time of this review there is no set list or details in the way of content. Before I provide those I want to address the video and sound quality. Both are more than adequate, especially since some of the content is over seventy years old. I am pleased with the quality of the transfers, but I am also aware that when dealing with old video and sound it's nearly impossible to economically achieve perfection. And much of the content here is not perfect.

Here is what's on the video:

Ella Fitzgerald Ella Fitzgerald and her Orchestra are on the first three tracks that is from a 1965 TV show:
1. A- Tisket, A-Tasket
2. Imagination
3. Oh! Lady Be Good

Sarah Vaughan has the next six tracks from various performances. Some are from Snader telescriptions from the early 1950s and Misty is from 1959:
4. You're Mine, You!
5. The Nearness Of You
6. You're Not The Kind
7. Perdido
8. Misty
9. Over The Rainbow

Carmen McRae's four performances are from Ralph Gleason's 1962 broadcast of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-Casual-Carmen-McRae/dp/6305320551/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz Casual - Carmen McRae</a>. These clips alone are worth the cost of this DVD:
10. Trouble Is A Man
11. If You Never Fall In Love with Me
12. 'Round Midnight
13. Love For Sale

I am not sure of the source of June Christy's performances but the video is reasonably good and the clips a valuable record of a popular swing vocalist from the Stan Kenton band:
14. Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'
15. He's Funny That Way
16. Takin' A Chance On Love

Peggy Lee's two clips are from Snader telescriptions circa 1950-51. A gem is her rendition of Why Don't You Do Right:
17. Why Don't You Do Right
18. I Cover The Waterfront

Lena Horn is positively wonderful in her clips, both taken from movies:
19. Born On Friday (and Unlucky Woman) are from the 1943 movie titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Woogie-Dream-1943/dp/B002PI4TXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Woogie Dream (1943)</a>.
20. Stormy Weather is from the movie of the same title:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stormy-Weather/dp/B000UL088I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stormy Weather</a>.

The final track is Helen Humes backed by Dizzy Gillespie and his orchestra in 1947:
21. Hey Baba Leba

This DVD is 68 minutes long and is a nostalgic trip into the past, covering performances from the early 1940s through the mid 1960s. If you are a fan of some of the great jazz vocalists of that era or this DVD contains one or more of your favorites this is a bargain.",1376265600,,2955,5.590604026845638
