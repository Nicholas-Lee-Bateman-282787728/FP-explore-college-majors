5006730,5,B006MWA906,"I've never read the comic, but my sister got me hooked on the anime with the words ""chibi Italy"". (chibi are tiny cute versions of a charater with biiiggg eyes)

The premise of the show is simple: countries are personified as bishonen (cute boys), and historical events are played out on a personal level (such as the allying of Italy and Germany, or the interaction of Italy and The Holy Roman Empire). The episodes are about 5 minutes in length.

I don't know too much about World War II, so I didn't have any problems with historical inaccuracy, on the contrary, I probably learned some things (I feel dumb, but I had never heard of the term ""Axis Powers"" before watching this show).

It is easy to be offended by this show, as the characters (countries) are stereotypical- i.e. Italy is a cute, but totally dumb bishonen, who occasionally dresses up in a maid outfit and looks just like a girl. So, for example if you are Italian, you might object to your county's portrayal and/or handling of historic events. Or you might object to the turning of very serious war matters into jokes. But if you are able to look past all that you might enjoy this funny and entertaining show.

I've seen this show in both Japanese and English. It is easier to watch in English, especially when a bunch of characters start talking all together very quickly (hard to read subtitles), the actors did an excellent job and the script was well adapted, with the jokes adjusted slightly to fit the language and culture. But the Japanese cast was also really good, so I am hard pressed to say which one I liked better.

PS Hetalia is composed of two parts: Hetalia: Axis Powers and Hetalia: World Series. So this set is only the first half of the entire series of Hetalia.",1331683200,61,1753,4.552380952380952
5006731,4,B006MWA906,omgz I was all like YEA :D when I got it. I was a little disappointed to see the box was just a slide thingy. u push it out the movie holding thing. (i fail at reviews) anyway Hetalia is a great series that everyone should see. Just a warning... there is cursing and small nudity. (*cough* *cough* france *cough*) but its no big deal. Buy it today ppl! :3,1330992000,4,355,4.085714285714285
5006732,5,B006MWA906,"I'll begin with this: this show was NOT intended for those that are easily offended or upset by stereotyping, historical inaccuracies, or the trivialization of major historic events (also, homophobics beware this is not the show for you).

Other then that this show is a funny 5 min episodes of pure fun and enjoyment.

With the dubbing of ""Hetalia"" you would fear that it would be stripped of everything not PC (which is literally the entire show). However, in the English version, the jokes are more offensive and the innuendo more rampant. The Japanese version skirted around any Nazi references, but the English version throws one in no more than a 2 minutes into the first episode.

While this show is rated TV-MA Trust me your teenage kids will most likely seen and or hear of everything that this show lets out (but it is not a show for the super young). The rating is mainly for language (trust me there are a lot of cussing).

This is a wonderful show, that promotes cultural understanding by not pointing the finger of blame at any one country for any of the bloody events of the past, instead choosing to simply make each country lovable in its own quirky way (plus make fun of them all).

And yes people I have this complete series not the 2 parts (I bought it at a con a week ago) and I find it to be fun and enjoyable.",1330300800,45,1332,4.442622950819672

5006737,5,B006MWA906,"I'm a huge anime fan and I love history; in fact, I'm majoring in history with the hopes of being a history teacher in the future. When I found out that an anime had a heavy focus on historical events, I knew I had to get my hands on it! Hetalia is a delightful and adorable anime, with many lovable characters and funny episodes. However, it should be noted that this show heavily uses many stereotypes and jokes that not everyone will feel comfortable with. That being said, a lot of the humor is on the lighter side, such as America's obsession with hamburgers, Canada being soft spoken and too nice, and England's obsession with magical creatures. The episodes are very short, about 5 minutes; however, the intro and outro flow so smoothly that it is easy to binge watch. I highly recommend this series.",1481328000,3,807,4.572413793103448

5006740,5,B006MWA906,"To start off, this is not a children's anime series and I knew that at time of purchase. This series is not politically correct either. This show stereotypes countries down to single characters and it is hilarious! I am not typically an anime fan as it seems most series have overly emotional characters and unnecessary yelling. However, I wanted to give this series a shot because the idea sounded awesome and as long as you know what the series is about you won't be disappointed! The only thing I don't care for is the episodes are each around 5 minutes and the end theme song plays after each episode. I was able to skip it with the chapter button but I could see how it could annoy some people. At least the song is fast paced and catchy. Depending on the episode, the country singing it changes so that is fun too.",1466467200,2,820,4.401315789473684

5006777,5,B006MWA906,"Hetalia is unexpected surprise. The idea of cute guys personifying various superpowers and countries sounded like a flimsy shallow material. Fortunately, its far more than that.

It's loosely based on WW2 with the Axis and Allied Powers going at each other, with cowardly pasta-loving romantic Italy as the title character. This anime makes fun of the different stereotypes and generalizations from each country and turns them in something lighthearted and thoroughly funny. And quite possibly persuade you to go into deeper research for the facts. Despite the episodes being only 5 minutes, theres no anime I can think of thats using its short running time so efficiently!

It is not perfect however. Some story segments are predictable, rehashed, or not pushed further. Some segments I didn't really enjoy were ""America's Storage Cleaning"", which it was simply dragged on a bit long when they could've used that time to tell other stories.

Music is fittingly whimsical if not a technical marvel. However the ending song ""Marukaite Chikyuu"" (""Draw a Circle, There's the Earth"") is a fantastic anthem song and each of the Allies and Axis Powers get their own cover!

Animation wise, it's cheerful and colorful but like the music, it's nothing to write home about. However veteran animator Masaaki Kannan, creates wonderful character designs and supervise the animation for the series. That being said, it remains eye pleasing and consistent it not breathtaking.

The Japanese version is what you'll expect. High quality voice work, wide and distinct vocal ranges, and well known seiyuus such as Daisuke Namikawa (Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle) as Italy and Akira Sasanuma (Link, Twilight Princess) as Austria . In this version, various dialects are used as opposed to accents for speech. They really get into character hit the right emotional arcs for their characters, which is slightly diminished in the dub.

The English dub by Funimation, for better or worse, the do more than just use accents and changing the dialogue to suit the English audience better. They would add more historical fact or stereotypes and sometimes come up with a completely new punch line. Along with above average voice acting, it is still a very satisfying experience.

DVD menus are easy to navigate along with a decent amount of extra content. Extras include historical background used for the show, voice actor and director interviews, as well as episode commentaries. Back tracking can be difficult however due to the lack of episode titles and thumbnails. Overall, the DVD content and packaging are probably the best I can ask for.

I cannot say enough on how much I really enjoyed this series. It's a lighthearted but well thought out series with cheery visuals and music. You also can't go wrong with either the Japanese and English as they different approaches. DVD extras are adequate when taking the content of the series as a whole. Highly recommended!",1437177600,8,2942,5.140167364016737
5006778,5,B006MWA906,This is the funniest show I have seen in a while. If you are starting your anime collection; you need to start with this one.  ;-),1436486400,,130,4.0
5006779,5,B006MWA906,"I love animes that are funny and not so serious so I can wind down after a day of school or work, and let me tell ya, this is probably the best anime series I have ever watched!! The characters are so lovable and hilarious, what's not to love? All the way to America shoving hamburgers down his throat, France being a perv, Japan refraining from speaking, and Prussia being AWESOME!!

You might be wondering if this show is educational in anyway, and IT IS! I'm not joking when I say I got an A in history because of this show. The characters are personified as countries, they're easy to remember and hard to forget! They mainly discuss WW2 in season 1-2 but they sprinkle other facts about other wars and pacts in other episodes, which are hard to miss.

You'll be addicted to this series in a heart beat, have fun watching!

5006833,5,B006MWA906,"14 year old daughter loves this show.  OKay, it might not be the most politically correct, but would you believe that she actually got interested in WWII because of this show?!?

But other than that, it's just fun-- Basically every country is stereotyped into a character-- So America is lazy, self-centered, and eats a lot of burgers... If you can't laugh at that-- then I do NOT recommend this show to you.  If that gave you a bit of a chuckle, well, then the other characters would probably crack you up too.  (Italy: ""Make Pasta! Not War!"")

She also has the Hetalia Paint It White movie and says she likes that better than the series boxed set, though--

What she doesn't like about the series boxed set is that they mix the WWII parts with the Chibi-Hetalia parts, and she said that gets confusing and she wishes they would've put all the chibi-Hetalia parts together and all the WWII parts together.  (The Chibi ones are the characters in cute little form and represents the country/characters as children-- so the story telling has a fractured timeline that she doesn't enjoy, I guess is what she is saying...)

Other countries are introduced with how they are perceived. This show on the serious side, explains history through out time, telling of how the Roman empire became great, it fell and now Italy is the grandson to this empire.

Some of the jokes were re-worded as well so I actually got them (whereas on the sub they simply seemed like a statement).  There is a problem others have that I don't- apparently the comedy is a bit thick and political for some.  But I get it pretty much every time.

As far as packaging go, this came fairly quickly and was secured in a surprisingly hard to open box. The cover was also vacuum sealed in plastic.

The only thing I could say against it is that oddly dramatic opening scene that appears every time a new episode starts is NOT skippable....skip it and miss a scene, or watch it and be annoyed for a few moments?

When I decided to watch it, I realized why so many people had been won over by Hetalia. Normally, this isn't my type of show, but I couldn't help but be won over. Hetalia tells history in a way that is entertaining and makes a person want to learn more. You can watch and laugh, and as dorky as it may sound, you're also learning. My favorite events in history- yes, history was always one of my favorite classes- have now been realized and it's fun to watch. Having countries personified as individuals also makes it more understandable and emotionally captivating.

I've learned more about different countries that have always interested me and with each episode and the different ways in which it portrays historical events, I am utterly enjoying myself! Hetalia has become part of my life. To mention any moment in history covered in the show, you will think of the characters. I highly recommend buying this and watching it, or just watch one episode, because I am sure you will love it!

The shipping was about right in time. You can trust amazon to do their shipping well. If you've never seen the show and are easily offended about your race or country then I wouldn't suggest it. Although, it doesn't just get racy with one or two countries it makes them ALL have faults. It's funny because of all the stereotypes and almost random humor. Like it says on the box if you're in it for the history, hetalia is rather fast paced and at times out of order. It isn't the most reliable source for it either. But! It does give you a lot of random interesting facts to look forward too. If you're an an American I find that most Americans I show this to don't like how the revolution is portrayed, just for your info. Also, they are almost all boys, so there might be a little gayness from time to time, but it's cute so its easy to overlook. But if you're a yaoi fangirl, I've gotta say not a better, more entertaining, anime could've fallen into your hands and also support some adorable yaoi (it's not ALL yaoi though, dur.).

5006886,4,B006MWA906,"If you enjoy Politically Incorrect humor, you might find any of the Hetalia amusing. Although some might find some character comments to be stretching the intentional offensiveness envelope beyond the pale. Having done some world travel myself, I found the series and movie does a good job of presenting national stereotypes as those from other countries see them, i.e. not just a Japanese-centric author's view. Even the English dubbed voice-overs stay true to the original's intention. An added bonus is the fact that you might even learn something historically or culturally you never heard before; Such as the existance of Sealand, proposed ""Marriage"" (mergers) of France and England, and other trivia.

As a person who likes to follow politics, I found Hetalia very entertaining. Yet I dropped points for the constant interruptions with the previous episode's trailer opening previews, opening credits, the ""Circle Song"" and next episode trailers in the 5-minute episode format to be a little annoying, too redundant and a constant distraction from an otherwise entertaining product. Granted, I understand that director ""Bob"" did it that way as his way of attempting to seperate each portion into a Webcomic page, similar to ""Sunday Funnies"" style of cartooning, but IMHO it just doesn't work

5006900,5,B006MWA906,"Alright full disclosure time:  I am one of those ""Johnny come lately"" people to the Hetalia party.  I had actually gotten one of those glossy cards from an Anime convention some years ago with two of the Hetalia characters (Japan and America) but that was, at the time, the most I ever knew about it.  A few months ago (yes I said months and this section of Hetalia has been around since 2010) I started watching some random clips of the show because I started to have some interest and then it was off to the races.

Now that we got all that mess out of the way let's talk about the actual series itself...

This series takes place between WWI and II so you will meet the ""Axis"" and the ""Allies"" mostly.  The Axis consists of the following:

Germany
Japan
England

(There are others but for the purposes of this review we'll pretend they don't exist yet)

The Allies are:

America
England
Russia
China
France

(There is Canada...but no one acknowledges his existence)

There are other countries that you will meet in this series that have a major/semi-major role in this series such as Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Austria, the AWESOME Prussia (And for a time he used to be the ANNOYING Prussia to me), Sealand and a variety of others...oh yeah at least one Nordic shows up...but I try to pretend he doesn't exist (If you are curious its Finland).

Now let's also get to this ""Elephant in the room"":  How the countries are portrayed

In the world of Hetalia the countries are portrayed as people and have a characteristic that is a symbol of their country (Ukraine's ""Colossal Knockers"" are representative of the ""Fertile tracts of land"" in her country) so you have to take that into account when you watch it.  Also the vast majority of the countries represented in THIS series are men so if you are slightly homophobic staying away from this series might be a good idea!

If you want to know my favorite country/character/voice actor in the series its Austria/Roderich Edelstein/Chuck Huber.  The ""Austrian Aristocrat"" is by far one of the coolest and funniest characters at times especially when he gets pissed.  Perfect example is episode 6 when he ""shows his utter disgust for Germany through the piano"".  I've said it aloud and I'll say it here.  If we all resolved our anger the way Austria does in this one clip the world would be a better place...just sayin'

favorite clip in this season:  That's an easy one and it involves Austria and Prussia

After a meeting in the supermarket Austria, Switzerland and Lichtenstein go to lunch (because Austria offered and Switz is a cheapskate) and the three are at a fairly high class place.  Everything goes fine until Prussia rears his head and calls out Austria for being just as cheap as Switzerland which was funny as hell and in a bizarre way made Prussia semi-likable to me (Fan fiction did the rest)

WOW okay this turned into a bit of a full length novel didn't it?  Let me wrap this up then

If you are into historical accuracy you might not watch this but there is some cool stuff to learn even among all the slapstick and sometimes crude humor of this series.  Its definitely a series that I recommend to anyone who needs a good laugh and just wants to have fun.  We all have series' that make us laugh till it hurts well this one just about did that for me and I can't recommend it enough
