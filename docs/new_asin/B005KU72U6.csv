8477248,4,B005KU72U6,"Ran across this series here on Amazon. I don't have cable so I was unaware of the show. Took a chance and ordered it. I'm a fan of most of the shows like this that Discovery Channel produces, so I figured I would like this one too. And I did - but not a lot. I think one of the reasons I really didn't get into this series is that they imposed a two-week time limit on all the projects that they did. Which might not have been bad, but they came up with some really involved projects and I just didn't think that they had time enough to develop them to the degree that they could have been. IMO, they really should have given themselves at least three weeks. Something else that I thought was a issue, is that I never really got to know the four guys that were featured on the show. They all were a bit generic, even after watching most of the episodes I had a hard time remembering who was who and what was their specialty. I think that was due to how they kept cutting from one cast member to another and never spending much time on any of them.

Another problem I had with the show, was most things that they attempted came off a bit canned - the facilities they worked out out were custom made for them. The projects at times seemed a bit too easy. For example the Backyard Waterslide Simulator episode - the main component, the fiberglass slide was given to them by a waterslide company. The project they ended up building was engineered by another company. And most of the work that went into building the machine, was done by other people. It was an interesting build - I just think there should have been more done by the show's cast.

Still, I found the series interesting to watch and would recommend.
