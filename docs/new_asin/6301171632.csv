7810279,5,6301171632,"Very pleased.  It's nice to get two related shows on a VHS, but someday we hope more of the Lawrence Welk material will be released on DVD.  As far as the shows go, these are two great ones.  We enjoyed watching it last Christmas and New Year's.",1454371200,,245,4.170212765957447
7810280,4,6301171632,"Musically, The North Dakotan Larry

Welk, son of Volga german ancestors,

had no peers in the big band, polka

style American music. I have watched

many of his shows over the years in

the household I grew up in! North

Dakota's contribution, along with

the late Gordon Kahl (although some

of Kahl's beliefs were kinda nutty)

to our civilization. Welk, who pas-

sed away at age 88 some yrs. back

has a great Museum up in that state

as well!",1150243200,,447,4.45
7810281,5,6301171632,"This VHS tape covers 2 terrific Lawrence Welk shows on one VHS tape. Each show is about 47 minutes in length. The first show is ""Christmas Reunion 1985"" (the Amazon listing reads 1995, but that is an error) and the second show is ""New Year's Party 1971."" Of the 25 Lawrence Welk VHS tapes on Amazon, this one is the most affordable and of excellent quality listed in the Marketplace as low as $4.95.",1109721600,11,399,4.405405405405405
