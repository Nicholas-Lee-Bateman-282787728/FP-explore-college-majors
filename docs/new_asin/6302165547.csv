433346,5,6302165547,"""Went the Day Well?"" is incredibly suspenseful, historically fascinating, and surprisingly harsh.  It is a no-nonsense film made for a wartime populace.  While it incidentally packs in a lot of propaganda advice (how to spot suspicious activity, what to do in a military emergency, the importance of ""doing your bit"" for the country), the major drive of ""Went the Day Well?"" is to psychologically adapt a everyday people to wartime violence.  This means that terrible things happen to kind and lovable people, and--what is perhaps more upsetting--that kind and lovable characters kill people brutally.  It is a kind of cinema violence which I don't think that current cinema prepares us (the one contemporary film it reminds me of is ""A History of Violence,"" in that both films take violence seriously).  It probably owes a great deal of its touch to Graham Greene.

I'm surprised that one reviewer found the Germans portrayed sympathetically.  I would say the film's single identifiable flaw is that all of the Germans are shown to be heartless pigs.  It is always a shame when even propaganda that is ""in the right"" can't allow the fact that most people, even enemies, are fairly decent and civilized on a person-to-person level (the great message of Vonnegut's Mother Night).

""Went the Day Well?"" is that really very rare thing, a genuinely troubling film.  *And* it's exciting.",1187913600,26,1382,5.048458149779735
433347,4,6302165547,"This film is a very well made 2nd World War story, which is based on a short story by Graham Greene.

The acting was generally very good, although there was one officer who struck me as being particularly wooden, but his was a small part and of little consequence. There are quite a few memorable scenes in this film which (for 1942) are very tense. Interestingly it is the British who commit the more horrible acts of violence, whereas the Germans are mostly portrayed in quite a good light.

Unlike a modern film the acts of violence in this film were never shown in graphic detail, but surprisingly the film made it quite obvious what was about to happen, even if they couldn't show the detail. In this respect another aspect of the films strengths was the cinematography.

My only other criticism is that the surprise element in the film is removed by the introduction by one of the villagers at the start of the film. Overall though this is one of the very best 2nd world war films made at the time I have ever seen. Strongly recommended.",1176940800,7,1043,4.507936507936508

The narrator proceeds to tell the story about how the village was invaded by Germans in 1942.  The Germans were disguised as British Soldiers, but soon gave themselves away.  The town found itself the prisoners of the Germans, and the film shows how the citizens coped with the situation.  Even though we know what the ultimate end of the story is, the film does an excellent job of making us doubt the final outcome.",1167955200,20,587,4.5

One of the most subversive films to come out of World War II, a British drama that was unsettling in its day and is even more so now.  Still truly unnerving, one can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for audiences facing the very real threat of Nazi enslavement.

I knew director Cavalcanti only from Dead of Night - oh, and Nicholas Nickleby, like this film produced by Daniel Day-Lewiss granddad Michael Balcon. Bad guys Leslie Banks (for me, Chorus from Oliviers Henry V) and handsome David Farrar (later a Michael Powell star in The Small Back Room & Black Narcissus). Good guys Mervyn Johns (also Dead of Night but above all my favorite Bob Cratchit opposite Alastair Sims Scrooge) and Frank Lawton (MGMs grown-up David Copperfield but just saw him again as the inconstant love interest of Margaret Leighton - who reminds me of Laura Linney - in the Robert Donat Winslow Boy).

433449,5,6302165547,"Maybe the best movie Ive seen all summer was recently broadcast on Turner Classic Movies for the first time 70 years after it was initially released.

Based on a 1940 Graham Greene short story (""The Lieutenant Died Last""), this rarely seen, brutal, unexpected and unnerving home front propaganda is front loaded with a visceral paranoia that is much more than a mere wartime conspiracy thriller or a Tarantinoesqe black-comic nightmare.  On the surface it is a surrealist masterpiece about a troop of English-appearing  army types who are in fact Nazis in the process of taking over the quaint English village of Bromley Greene in 1942.

The title comes from the opening line in a familiar English poem frequently used to honor the dead of WW I and later WW II.

Went the day well?
We died and never knew.
But, well or ill,
Freedom, we died for you.

The film begins with a drive into town and the genial town gravedigger recollecting to the camera the Battle of Bromley Greene.  He stands by a memorial in the 13th century churchs cemetery honoring the dead and reflects on the battle of some years past before Hitler was conquered (even though the film was made in the midst of war.)  The quiet confidence of good conquering evil is breathtaking.  The opening reminded me of the narrator in the play Our Town.

The film was released in America as FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, but in fact the story covers 72 hours during the ill-fated German invasion.  The movie opens with Nazi officer Ortier (Basil Sydney) parachuting into Bromley and contacting local turncoat Oliver Wellsford (Leslie Banks).  They use the movies title as a password.  Slowly the villagers pick up inadvertent and seemingly benign clues (an Austrian chocolate bar, numbers on a note written in the Continental manner, etc.) about the strange behavior of the British uniformed men living among them.  When Mrs. Collins, the postmistress-telephone operator, alerts some of her fellow townspeople, they slowly and methodically are whipped into action, finding ways to subvert the enemy and alert the authorities.  The tension and action explode when a group of villagers worshipping in the church are held hostage and the vicar is shot dead when he defiantly rings the church bell as an alarm.

As directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, the big surprise is the savagery of the action, especially after the mild opening in the bucolic setting.  Suddenly, Home Guard soldiers are shot on a patrol, and a group of children are set up to be shot in an cold-blooded effort to punish adults for disobeying orders.

The resourcefulness of the townspeople in the defense of their land and homes is relentless and shocking.  A Bromley woman sweet talks a German, then throws pepper in his eyes and whacks him with the only weapon handy -- an axe.  And we root for her.  As we do when a society woman grabs a grenade in a willing self-sacrifice to save the lives of others.  Theres a righteous vengeance in the improvised, extensive combat that seems very modern  at least in cinematic terms.

Ealing Studios was famous for its comedies in the 1930s.  WENT THE DAY WELL? was planned as a piece of simple propaganda to warn the British public about the looming threat of a Nazi invasion.  Even though that particular threat had diminished somewhat by the time of the films 1942 released, the movie was like an emotional injection that encouraged resilience, vigilance and courage.  But even more than that, it celebrated their common bond of pluck, fortitude and community spirit on which the Brits prided themselves throughout the war.

Watching it today, one is reminded of the sanctity and sacred place we call home and that real evil can lurk on our borders.  And it is not a paranoid fantasy to be alert to those who, for whatever reason, within or outside our borders, wish to take that away from us.  And sometimes the enemy can look almost like us.

The movie was filmed (the cinematographer was Wilkie Cooper) in picturesque Turville in Buckinghamshire (just off the B482, if you're headed there).  Its remains relatively unchanged and is still used occasionally as a movie location.  If you have a region free Blu-ray player, theres crisp clean transfer available on Amazons UK site.

433452,5,6302165547,"There were several aspects of this movie that wowed me.  I do think that starting with ""this is how it ends"" gives the viewer a certain opinion of what the end is, but how the village gets to the point of burying them is the interesting part.

I expected sort of a camaraderie thing, a standard ""the men decide they can't take it any more and fight back"", but incidents that would be shocking today yet very truthful kept occurring, even up until the climax of the movie.  As for Germans being portrayed as ""heartless"" and therefore the film being ""clearly propaganda"", I have to say that many people on both sides had to throw away their humanity.  The situation was such that the most villainous person in the film (who we are in on early and it is so frustrating to see the villagers be clueless for so long) was pure evil, and the Germans were just doing their job.

All in all, it is very worth seeing, and the acting is very good.  You could feel the anguish and horror of the villagers as various things unfold.  You can see the frustration as things go from everyday to bad to better to worse.

I was convinced this could have been a real story.  A story that could be remade nowadays with few changes and certain incidents would be considered revolutionary and worth writing articles about.  Thank you to TCM for showing this.",1399766400,,1335,4.434426229508197
433453,5,6302165547,"Went The Day Well? is  a real find, which premiered for the first time only a few weeks ago on TCM. It warns  Brits in 1942 to be alert about Nazi invaders and fifth columnists. Its worth watching for its excellent cast, a great script and superb b&w cinematography. It came out of the legendary Ealing Studios, which shows they did more than great comedies",1398470400,,357,4.476923076923077
433474,4,6302165547,This was an excellent historical example of British propaganda with a positive result to the people of England.  The story was done quite well.

433475,4,6302165547,"The title paraphrases Winston Churchill's description of the difference between the United States and the United Kingdom, though I think Sir Winston mostly had in mind England.  If you speak German, of course, you will immediately recognize the German's penchant for ""knowing"" English but just not able to master the syntactical changeover that makes the statement idiomatically correct:  ""Is your day going well?""  Or....""How's your day going?""  Or even more English:  ""You alright?""  There's this distancing in the German psyche.  My wife was German, and having spent two years living and working in Germany (not the US military) as a teacher at a German prep school and working as an apprentice on a farm in the Black Forest, I have a grasp of German strengths and their few but deep frailties.  This film, in black and white, reveals both culture's mindsets and governing values and virtues.  Eric Blair, aka George Orwell wrote that England was one country in the world where you could brush a man off the pavement (sidewalk) and he would say to you, ""Sorry.""  This green and pleasant land's power is revealed in this movie.  The English powers of observation, penchant for infinitesimal detail, tolerance and gentleness not to mention spiritual freedom surfaces in mundane conversation and an equally mundane plot.  A metaphor perhaps, the village being the island of Britain...which is an island in more ways than geographically.  I recommend this film if you enjoy subtleties of divergent cultures.  It also reminds us that heroes are everywhere, a comforting thought nowadays.",1383523200,4,1585,5.1647058823529415

What promises in its opening minutes to be an eccentric British comedy of war-time pluck evolves into a very savage and vivid evocation of the socially corrosive effect of fighting a war of invasion on home territory.  When we remember that this film was made actually at a time of war the effect is quite an eye-opener.

The  film, while British in content and performance, was directed by the wordly Brazilian film-maker Alberto Calvacanti and so it is perhaps this which gives it its unsparing quality.  A disturbing masterpiece, perhaps?",1250899200,4,570,4.895833333333333
433478,4,6302165547,"Having recently found this at a local DVD store I was sufficiently intrigued enough to buy it. Having finally sat down to watch this film early this morning I was rather surprised by this little UK propaganda film. Unlike many of its counterparts (either American or Birtish that I've seen anyway) this film went beyond simple propaganda needs and became an intriguing thriller in its own right.

The film's cast helps to sell much of the story. From Basil Sydney and David Farrar as the officers leading the attack to Leslie Banks as their ally in the village to the young Harry Fowler along with Valerie Taylor, Frank Lawton and Muriel George amongst others the cast all seem perfectly natural in their roles. All in all the result is that it's a fine cast telling a fine story.

The main selling point of this film though is the story. Years before Jack Higgins would turn the concept into his bestseller (and later still a fine film) called The Eagle Has Landed writers John Dighton, Angus MacPhail and Diana Morgan would take a short story by famed writer Graham Greene (The Third Man, Our Man In Hanvana etc.) and create a fascinating tale. From the moment Mervyn Johns gives his introduction to his epilogue for the story the audience is aware that this is a World War II propaganda film without any doubt. Yet it soon becomes apparent that this is far more then that. The story soon becomes a tale of deception, double crosses and the power of the ordinary person in a time of war. While the film's propaganda message will be lost on many modern viewers, the story is a compelling one to be sure.

The production value's are handsome as well. Tom Morahan designs make for a highly convincing English village which one imagines couldn't have been easily built during wartime. Famed composer William Walton (soon the become famous for his work on the Olivier Shakespere films) provided a fine score, especially at the opening and closing of the film. yet the highlight of the production side of the film is the wonderful cinematography by Wilkie Cooper. Cooper's cinematography, from sunny summer days to the moodiness of a night of desperate attempts, perfectly fits each moment and situation.

The film isn't perfect of course. While the story is intriguing in itself, there is something of a mistake made by having the opening and closing done by actor Mervyn Johns. While they serve a fine purpose as propaganda pieces (and of course bookends) the opening gives away quite a bit very early on which dampens the surprise that comes as the film progresses. There's also the staging of the battle sequences that, like many films of this era, seems rather dated today with all its hollering and men falling over. These are relatively minor problems though when compared with the rest of the film.

With the combination of intriguing story, nice performances and handsome production values Went The Day Well? is an intriguing film. While at times it is an overly obvious piece of World War II propaganda as a thriller it stands up quite well nearly seven decades on from when it was made. With its timeless tale of the power of the ordinary person it is a film that speaks even now.",1239321600,9,3187,4.724820143884892

Despite actually being made during the Second World War, this is not a crude propaganda film but rather a morale boosting entertainment for the sorely pressed British. The film showed how English resolve and love of country can overcome all and where ordinary folk risk, and some lose, their lives to do their bit for the country.
The stars are an A-list of 1940s actors & actresses, all sadly passed on now  Leslie Banks, Marie Lohr, Frank Lawton, Elizabeth Allan, Thora Hird, Mervyn Johns, Basil Sydney & Grace Arnold. The infantry appearing were actual soldiers from the Gloucestershire Regiment, who had volunteered to be in the film as extras for added realism. How the film was even made (at Ealing Studios, London) under wartime conditions is quite amazing.
Overall, an excellent film for folk interested in this period  not a historical movie, nor a futuristic movie, but one set and made in the actual present of those acting and those viewing.",1503014400,,1536,4.858778625954199
7822026,4,6302165547,"For a fan of old British films, this is something of a curiosity, and one where the backstory contributes almost as much of the interest as the film itself.

First off, its produced by Michael Balcon and Ealing Studios, better known for its stellar run of comedies from the late 40s to mid-50s, often starring Alec Guinness, that, for many people, exemplify a certain type of Englishness. These include Hue and Cry (1947), Kind Hearts and Coronets, Passport to Pimlico, and Whiskey Galore! (all 1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), and The Ladykillers (1955). So, an Ealing war film would seem to be something of an oddity. In fact Ealing actually made a number of such films during the war and afterwards, most notably The Cruel Sea in 1953, often thought of as one of the best British war films ever.

Second, are the origins of the film, and the reasons for making it. Its based, loosely, on a short Graham Greene story, The Lieutenant Died Last, published in 1940. This was essentially a propaganda piece placed in the American market (Colliers Weekly), to promote support for the British during the war, and which was never intended for publication in Britain itself. The idea of the story was to show that the average British civilian was quite capable of fighting back against an invading force, and not just stoically keeping calm and carrying on, as they had through the Blitz of London (Sept 1940  May 1941).

Third, it also bore all the hallmarks of the British Ministry of Informations (MoI) attempts to rouse the British public to the dangers of invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany. After the end of the Blitz, Hitlers expected invasion of Britain never materialized, so opinion polls showed that the British public no longer feared invasion. Additionally, many Britons complacently thought any invasion that was attempted wouldnt get very far, which worried government officials. So, the MoI sought to make the public aware of the harsh realities and consequences of what occupation might bring. Ealings timing was out, though, as while invasion was still a possibility in March 1942 when the film went into production, that likelihood had faded significantly by November when it was released in Britain (and certainly had by June 1944 when it was finally released in the US).

The film was also made on the usual tight Ealing (low) budget, with a director (the Brazilian Alberto Cavalcanti) with a background in producing documentaries rather than directing feature films. Not only that, but the film was intended to do one thing in the US market and another in the British one, so its not surprising that it doesnt always work on all levels.

The result is a plot and some performances that do not always stand up to heavy scrutiny, and which is more competent and workmanlike than true classic. The plot has 60 German paratroopers converging on a sleepy English village with the intention of knocking out Britains radio-location capacity to open the way for a full Nazi invasion. Once the unsuspecting villagers (rather like the equally complacent British public) finally catch on to reality, they fight back in any way they can until the regular British army and Home Guard can ride to their rescue at the end of the film.

The drawbacks, to modern eyes, are mostly due to the budgetary constraints and the technology available at the time. First off, British actors play all the Germans. This means they're all pitch-perfect playing British officers and Tommies, but rather less so when required to drop the pretense and show themselves for the Nazis they truly are. The scene when Basil Sydney reveals himself as a German officer is rather comic, as rather than moving straight from British officer BBC English accent direct to officious German accent, he slowly morphs from one to the other over the course of several lines, as though not capable of a direct switch! Nor are all the fight scenes convincing either, with some of the German soldiers being rather limply over-powered.

It does have a surprisingly dark edge to it, though. Cavalcantis documentary background meant he presented the scenes where the villagers fight back in a very straightforward way. Most notably this sees Muriel Georges rather matronly village postmistress, Mrs. Collins, dispatching the German soldier billeted on her with an axe! British audiences of the time cheered the scene in cinemas! There are no histrionics involved, no blood is seen on screen, its all just done in a very matter of fact way  British understatement at its finest.

Overall, then, not a classic, but still an enjoyable enough way of spending 90 minutes if you like this type of film.

Finally, a note on the DVD itself. Although it wasn't noted in the info on Amazon, this looks like a made-to-order disc, rather than a general release. The disc itself has the characteristic blue color of a dvd-r, and the inlay sheet is basic; mostly a version of the hand-drawn movie poster (repeated on the title screen too), and it erroneously lists Christopher Lee as being amongst the cast (which he isnt! He wouldnt appear on screen for another five years). There are no extras on the disc either, the only menu options being play movie and scene selections. The print is clear and crisp though, so nice to view.",1502323200,,5285,4.887276785714286
