I never missed the weekly sci-fi/horror films on TV Saturday night and afternoon. I was in a nostalgic mood this Halloween and wanted to watch some of my old favorites. I never heard of this film and I decided to watch this film as an early selection for my Halloween horror marathon. It is a nice surprise to watch something so old that you have never seen before. The movie does have a good cast with Richard Long(Nanny and the Professor) David Janssen(The Fugitive) and Marshall Thompson(who popped up in many of these pictures). It's much better than some other old mumbo jumbo voodoo movies I've seen but, it was a tad too long for me. I can understand other reviewer's giving this a higher rating because they grew up with it and it is special to each of them. This is available on DVD on Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection volume 2. The print is really nice!",1193788800,3,967,4.438202247191011
552185,5,6303046509,"If you haven't seen Cult of the Cobra, then your in for a treat!

This is a great old Univeral horror flick from the studio's

heyday in the '50.

 It has all the elements of a British horror tale. Set in the

far east. A group of American GIs are on leave for a few days.

Seeking some fun and excitment. They let begger talk them into

seeing a secret ceramony, held by a cult of snake worshippers!

 Trouble ensues when they are discovered by the cults high priest. A fight breaks out and the GIs barely escapes with their

lives! But as they run for it, the High Priest swears vengence

against the infidel intruders. He calls upon the Cobra Goddess

to hunt down the men one by one. And bring a terrible death upon

them!

 The rest of the story procees from there. And it's great camppy

fun to watch. I fully recomend this one.

 And it is my great hope that Universal will create another box set of its lesser known horror and science fiction films. like it did for its Legacy Collection of Master Horror films.",1157155200,4,1019,4.273684210526316

Faith Domergue is awesome as the ""lady cobra"". She actually metamorphoses into one. I saw this film when it first came out in 1955 and the memory is still fresh in my mind. I think this is her best film.",1052870400,10,265,4.32

552188,4,6303046509,"If you like cobras and if you like Faith Domergue you'll like this film.  At the beginning the mysteriousness of the cobra cult is well done as the  servicemen watch.  I'm afraid I found it difficult not to root for the  villainess because the cult of the cobra had been breached in the  beginning. Faith, the villainess cobra lady, steals the show.  Her  beautiful eyes are highlighted just before she turns into the cobra.  Each  time she appears in the film you're drawn to stare at her eyes wondering if  it's time for her to change into a cobra again. The cobra's perspective is  realistic as it seeks out its next victim. I viewed this movie when it came  out in the theater in the '50s and again much later on TV at which time I  recorded it.  Although the review isn't supposed to center on an actress I  must say this movie made me an instant fan of Faith Domergue.",965260800,17,874,4.341614906832298
7836519,4,6303046509,"Six soldiers bait a snake handler into showing them a super-secret Lamian temple where women supposedly change themselves into snakes.  Theres a dance.  One of the soldiers whips out a HUGE camera and takes a picture of the dancer putting herself back into a basket.  Not unlike some Disneyland attractions, a FLASH is not appreciated.  Pandemonium ensues.  People run, the temple is set on fire, and a curse is invoked.  Naturally the soldiers think its a lark until the photographer is snake bit.  Hes momentarily saved only to be bitten again in the hospital and dies.  Back in New York, the other five soldiers soon discover that distance will not save them from the curse and a particularly vengeful snake woman (Faith Domergue).

This movie has its moments.  It would have been better served though with a different actress playing the killer.  Someone who could actually convey menace and not just stare vacuously.  This movie is more notable for its all-star male cast featuring Richard Long, Marshall Thompson, David Janssen, and Jack Kelly.",1497225600,,1050,5.005780346820809

This leads to their being cursed, and stalked by an eeevil, murderous presence (aka: a rubber snake, complete w/ p.o.v. ""cobra-vision""). CULT OF THE COBRA is a decent enough, 1950's creeper, starring the lovely Faith Domergue (THIS ISLAND EARTH, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA) as the titular woman / death-bringing-creature-of-ultimate-doom. Among the soldiers are David Janssen (MOON OF THE WOLF, FER-DE-LANCE), Richard Long (HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL), and sci-fi mainstay, Marshall Thompson (IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, FIRST MAN INTO SPACE). While more modern viewers may consider this movie a tad slow, the plot is intriguing, and Ms. Domergue's ssslithery performance is quite effective.

7836524,2,6303046509,"Cult of the Cobra, 1955 film

This takes place in Asia (?) in 1955. American soldiers walk in a marketplace and take pictures. They see a snake charmer. The Lamians believe men and woman can turn into snakes. They are told where this happens for $100 (a huge sum then). Daru takes $10 as a down payment. The soldiers wear robes and are warned to keep silent on pain of death. Then the show begins! The flash of a camera starts a small riot. The soldiers flee in their jeep, then return for Nick. One man cuts the snakebite to release the venom. The wounded corporal is into a hospital, the window is open! Something happens at night! Only a snake with a brain could do it. The others return to New York city. One soldier hears bad news. Late at night a woman screams! She saw a man! She has just arrived in New York. Tom befriends Lisa.

They see the sights together. A small dog barks at Lisa. [Did you catch the clues?] Rico runs a neighborhood bowling alley. What is in his back seat? A woman walks away. There is a funeral. A horse shies away from Lisa. [Horse drawn wagons in New York city? Note that old style refrigerator.] Lisa left her gloves behind, he returns them to her apartment. Where is she? Later one of that group jumped out of a window! The next day two of that group are called to the police station; Carl is dead. Julia cooks with a pressure cooker. [Remember them?] The police question the pair. One tells about their experience in Asia and the threat. Can anything happen to Paul? He kisses Lisa. Later the police find a body. Pete was found dead from snakebite. At the theater Julia is threatened by a snake. But it is pushed out the window, lands on the pavement, and is killed. Then it undergoes a metamorphosis!

This is a low-budget production that just runs along. One value is its views of New York city life in that era. [Even if filmed on a back lot.] Much has changed since then (but Im not a witness). How did Immigration allow a cobra to enter the country? I thought they were banned like vampires and werewolves.",1435536000,,2048,4.356020942408377

7836526,2,6303046509,"""Cult of the Cobra"" (1955) serves as passable drive-in fare, even though it's a blatant rehash of producer Val Lewton's ""Cat People""  right down to the jarring shock effects. The ""B"" thriller benefits from a good cast and decent production values, but should have been 10 minutes shorter. Devoted fans of Faith Domergue, Richard Long and David Janssen will not be disappointed. Edward Platt (""Get Smart"") briefly shows up as the high priest.",1393632000,2,441,5.041095890410959
7836527,4,6303046509,"About 50 years ago, when I was a young girl, a local station showed horror movies every Saturday afternoon and then again at night.  This flick was one of the scariest back then.  In the last few years, I've taken a look at some of those oldies.  A few still hold up.  THEM was the first one I ordered, and it was every bit as good; I still watch it occasionally.  A couple of years ago, I remembered this one and decided to purchase it.  In some ways, it's even better from an adult perspective.  Still can give a few chills, but raises some issues.  Such as, the ""heroes"" intruded on a private religious ceremony that was none of their business.  When a snake woman follows to punish them, she is considered the monster--at least back when the film was made.  I now have a lot more sympathy for her.

I keep hoping for a remake of this flick.  With current special effects, this could be a stunning experience.  I keep esp. thinking about when she injects her victims with venom.  That could be psychedelic.  And the shifting back and forth between woman and snake...a lot could be done with that, too.",1343260800,6,1104,4.396039603960396
7836528,3,6303046509,"In the 1950's, Universal Studios had their last great run at the science fiction, fantasy, and horror pictures they'd been pwning since the monumental releases of Dracula and Frankenstein in 1931. They had zipped through the previous decade mainly cranking out sequels starring different conglomerations of their famed Universal Studios Monsters, but those horror worthies were relegated to facing off against Abbott and Costello by the end of the decade. Universal rather admirably turned to a series of new monsters, and while some of them were a little out there (The Monolith Monsters, anyone?) having all new beasties to marvel at was probably more exciting than a ninth or tenth entry on the Frankenstein monster's resume'.
  The story here gives us six servicemen stationed in Asia in 1945, looking for kicks as World War II nears its end. They hear tell of a local cult who worship snakes and are even legendarily able to transform into snakes. One well placed bribe later, the sextet find themselves duded up in robes and watching one of the cult's rituals, warned to keep a low profile or face possible death. The ritual itself seems to consist more of variety show dancing than snake transformations, but finally there is a snake on a string that comes out of the same woven basket a woman crawled into. It's not much different than a bad Las Vegas magic show, but that doesn't stop the dumbest member of the group whipping out his trusty camera, which of course is the size of a lunch box and is equipped with a giant flash bulb.
  Flash! Sure enough, this causes no end of consternation among the cultists, and the film's biggest surprise occurs when the boys are summarily cursed by none other than the Chief of Control himself - Ed Platt!
  One guy runs a bit faster than the others, and he is soon after found snakebit outside the cult clubhouse. Luckily this doesn't kill him, but a second run-in with a snaky shadow in his hospital room sends him to the Great Beyond. Wow, that's just like what Ed Platt said, but the rest of the boys have to get packed to head home, so la-de-da.
  Back in America, the guys go about getting back to their lives, with Richard Long and Marshall Thompson rooming with each other heterosexually and fighting over the winsome Julia (Kathleeen Hughes). Then just as Julia decides to go Long, Faith Domergue shows up as a mystery woman and new girlfriend for Thompson, and shortly after, the boys start to find themselves facing off against that same snaky shadow, now backed up with low level snake-eye camera shots. Although the deaths seem to be accidents (car crash, fall off a balcony) only Long notices the bite marks seeping deadly cobra venom...
  What is Domergue's secret, and will Long be able to convince Thompson she's not what she seems? Or will Thompson assume Long is just blocking him again after winning over Julia? The answers await those brave enough to face...The Cult of the Cobra!
  This is not a bad little flick, helped immensely by the presence of familiar faces like Long, Jack Kelly, and David Janssen. Top billed Domergue is okay, a little too conflicted in her mission perhaps - it might have been more fun if she took more evil delight in her misdeeds, but that's a quibble. The movie is also a little light on monster action, as we only get a few shots of that String Cobra, er, I mean, King Cobra, in action, mainly making do with the aforementioned snake shadow and snake-eye camera. But it's fun in that 1950's horror flick way, with almost nobody working any kind of visible job - Hughes is in some kind of show, and Janssen runs a bowling alley back in the states, but the rest just hang out, drinking and smoking and not worrying about death curses. For that alone, this one gets a recommendation, just keep the anti snake venom serum handy!",1342828800,2,3825,4.675595238095238
