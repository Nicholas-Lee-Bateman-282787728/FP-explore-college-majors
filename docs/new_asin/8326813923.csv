1170770,5,8326813923,"I think that Bogowie (2014) and Miasto 44 (2014) are the two best Polish productions from last year.

Bogowie (Gods), is an autobiographical film on Zbigniew Religa (1938-2009), who was the most prominent Polish cardiac surgeon and later in his life a politician. The film only concentrates on the years from late 1970's to mid 1980's, and on the attempts of Religa and his loyal and hard working staff at the heart transplants.  The first successful transplant performed by Religa and his staff happened on November 5, 1985.  However the patient dies few days later from some complications.  In addition, the movie also concentrates a little on Religa's personal life, and his relations with wife and his staff.

The film authentically depicts the communist Poland from the well created sets to clothing, cars, furniture, and atmosphere.",1426982400,2,838,5.132352941176471
