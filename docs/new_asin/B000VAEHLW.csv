8217747,3,B000VAEHLW,"Master McAllister (Lee Van Cleef) and apprentice Max (Timothy Van Patten) are traveling the countryside in search for his missing daughter as they stop in a city where Max helps out with a cute biker girl who has a union outside of her cannery place and to also help clear Mcallister's name by rescuing hostages taken by terrorists.

Basically episodes 3 and 4 of the short lived ""Master"" series in one movie, the martial arts choreography is improved as is the acting but it's still a somewhat silly ""Kung Fu"" cash-in show only with ninjitsu instead of kung fu, MST3K had a ball with this movie and i don't blame them as it's not totally bad at all.",1314057600,,650,4.508474576271187
