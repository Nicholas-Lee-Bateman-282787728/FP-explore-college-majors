this film makes very little to no sense what so ever",1400716800,,89,3.5
8503060,5,B006QPKLWA,"The young film makers have embraced a difficult play with guts and verve and gone one further -- released their work to the public on a DVD. This is the kind of imagination, artistic integrity and courage that both the theatre and film need. I look forward to more work by this team.",1378080000,,283,4.3584905660377355
8503061,1,B006QPKLWA,"Very disappointed in this DVD. I did not notice that the run time was only eight minutes (my fault). Not being anywhere near a full version there really is not much here at all. The text of the original play is almost non existent. Moreover, the acting, makeup and production has the feel of a high school project. If you are interested in Euripides don't bother with this. If you are interested in amateur theatricals I suggest finding some kind of DVD collection or best of. This is simply not worth the money!",1334361600,7,512,4.516129032258065
