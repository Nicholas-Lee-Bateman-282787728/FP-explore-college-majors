His shtick was he was cheap but in real life he was very generous.
The forever 39 year old man.

8252087,3,B0013LPRXA,"The three stars pertain to the value of the purchase versus another product, not Jack Benny's humor. That is always 5 stars in my book.

There are so many public domain packs of 50's TV I can see why anyone would be confused as to which to buy. In this case, every episode in this two disc set except one is on the four disc set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Jack-Benny/dp/B000UVV260/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Jack Benny</a>. The one missing is ""The Railroad Station Program"". The four disc set is cheaper than this one and includes 40 episodes of programs starring Jack Benny. Most are from the Jack Benny Program, but several are from other shows in which Jack made a major appearance or from TV specials that he hosted. I recommend that product as a better buy. The episodes in this 2 disc set are:
DISC 1:

The Humphrey Bogart Show
Guest Star: Humphrey Bogart
Police Lt. Jack Benny grills notorious killer ""Babyface"" Humphrey Bogart. Bogart is promoting his new picture.

The Jam Session Show
Guest Stars: Fred MacMurray, Kirk Douglas, Dan Dailey, Tony Martin
Jack's friends are coming over for their weekly jam session. The band is Tony Martin on clarinet, Fred MacMurray on saxophone, Dick Powell on trumpet, Dan Daily on drums and Kirk Douglas on banjo.

The Christmas Show
Guest Star: Charles Cantor
Jack goes Christmas shopping with Rochester and drives the staff of the department store crazy.

Railroad Station Program
Guest Star: Artie Auerbach
Jack takes the train to New York to talk to his sponsor, Lucky Strike. He stays in the usual dump, the Acme Plaza, where a girl keeps phoning the room, arranging for her elopement. Unfortunately, Jack never tells her it is a wrong number.

Talent Show
Guest Star: Jayne Mansfield
During the monologue, Don announces that a purse has been found. It belongs to Jayne Mansfield, who was sitting in the audience when an usher grabbed her purse - a sneaky way to get a guest star. Jack hosts a talent contest and Mel Blanc plays an animal impersonator with hilarious results.

DISC 2:

Goldie, Fields and Glide
Guest Star: Bing Crosby
Jack recalls his old vaudeville days and the tours he made with his two partners, Bing Crosby and George Burns, who were billed as ""Goldie, Fields and Glide.""

How Jack Found Mary
Guest Star: Bea Benaderet
Jack and Mary have differing recollections of how they met when Mary worked at Macy's. In Jack's version, he is handsome spender. Mary remembers it very differently, especially buying the engagement ring.

Reminiscing About Last New Year's
Guest Star: Bob Crosby
When the show's cast invites Jack to a big New Year's Eve party, he turns them down because he has a date with his new lady friend Gloria. A couple of hours later, however, Jack finds himself at a ""party"" with his new date - Rochester.

The Honeymooners Show
Guest Star: Audrey Meadows
Jack plays Ralph Kramden in a take-off of The Honeymooners, with Audrey Meadows as Alice and Dennis Day as Ed Norton.

4 O'Clock In The Morning
Guest Star: Bea Benaderet
After being awakened at 4:00 a.m. by a phone call from ""Hank, The All Night Radio DJ,"" Jack finds that he can't get back to sleep. He and Mary go clothes shopping later that day, but it turns out to be an ordeal for the exhausted Jack.

All of these episodes are hilarious, but why buy not buy these episodes plus two more discs full of Jack Benny for a cheaper price?",1209859200,26,3442,4.833333333333333
