3563632,4,B001F2U6XI,"What a good show this turned out to be. It has good voice acting, likeable characters, and a good story. It is not the best anime I have seen but I have watched it twice since buying it 2 months ago(that is not normal for me) and would probably watch it again. It was really enjoyable and I can only pray that they release season 2 and 3 in english soon!!!",1236816000,2,356,4.028169014084507
3563633,5,B001F2U6XI,"Well, some people has given this a low score and for the life of me I can't understand why.  For starters the show is fun, lighthearted, and good.  It starts off well and it ends well.  If you like Anime, than you need to pick this one up.
The rights to this show were first given to Geneon, but they dropped it and Funimation picked it up, and delivered this 3 disked box set.  This is not a slim pack, what you get are three full case DVD's with a box that holds all three DVD cases.  The box has good art work, and the DVDs them self's have reversible covers.  The special features are not really worthy to be mentioned.  As with all Anime almost, you get the standard special features. Clean Opening, Clean ending, previews, and some art work, also some promo stuff, but not much.
The video and art of the show is really good, not too flashy, but not dull.  The audio is top notch, and the dubbing is superb.  As with all Anime there is going to be people that hate the English voice acting, but in this Anime the English dub is really good.
After this season of Zero there is two more seasons, which each has 12 new episodes.  Buy this  box set, it is a great deal for 13 episodes of a great, and fun Anime.

Update:

Just got a letter from Fanimation (I wrote them), they have said that they do not plan to release the other two seasons.  :-(  I guess not enough people bought this.  They probably downloaded this season, stupid so called fans (Pirates) ruin for everyone else.",1235952000,6,1483,4.242857142857143
3563634,3,B001F2U6XI,"The Familiar of Zero is an anime about a girl's experiences, and her classmates, at a magic academy. The plot revolves around her and her helper's day to day lives in the academy sprinkled in with various missions where students (apparently the most qualified despite being novices) go on tasks to root out problems facing them and their friends/school/country.

While the plot itself is dry and not treated very serious, hence it is hard to get drawn into, the bright spot of this anime is the humor. The aim is to throw as many jokes as they can at you in an episode. Be warned that there is a lot of crude humor, whether it be a woman's bust size, misunderstandings of awkward situations, or clothing malfunctions. If this is up your alley, jackpot as this is fanservice 101. But even aside from that, characters, even if 1 or 2 dimensional, are still enjoyable.

In addition to humor, there is some romance sprinkled in, but this is one of my biggest problems with these kinds of anime. Its the kind of romance where the intended couple briefly hooks up, breaks up, loves each other, than hates, there is very little progression in their relationship, and usually its romance followed by humor, not giving the romance a real chance to grow.

Recap, after you watch it you may forget the plot and some of the characters, but you'll have a lotta laughs in the process.",1233792000,13,1370,4.60655737704918
3563635,2,B001F2U6XI,"Port to R1 is good including a fine voice acting job and quality picture. The box set is of high quality as well. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the anime itself. In short, it is very generic. A fairly spineless guy gets to be beaten and generally mistreated by his favorite tsundere female lead (Louise). Every other girl in the anime likes and flirts with him, from the maids, the other students, the princess, you name it. And of course, you've got the mandatory dose of fan service, deja-vu misunderstandings and mishaps (followed by beatings of course). A lot of the situations would make you cry in sheer ridicule of it. All this done without the tacts and endearing qualities of IMO better animes in the genre such as Ah! My Goddess or Ai Yori Aioshi. The plot is  simple and predictable, definitely nothing to write home about and more of a background to the so-called romantic situations (in other words romantic for 5th graders). only redeeming part of the anime is the no-nonsense talking sword. If you like to check out your brain at the door when watching anime and enjoy fan service and harem setups, this is for you. If not, you're likely to be disappointed. For what it's worth I do not recommend the 2nd and 3rd seasons either as it's more of the same, just even less interesting since novelty has worn out.",1232409600,,1337,4.594142259414226
3563636,5,B001F2U6XI,"this series is a must have for anyone. Even if the person isn't into anime it is very funny, and with any starting series it doesn't have much of a story if that is what your looking for. All in all the series is about a guy that is transported to another world. Then the guy makes a contract with a noble witch. The guy has to do EVERYTHING for her, and the girl is a very abusive person. that is one reason why the series is very entertaining.
Some people will be disapointed about the story but the later series will be in the US later in the year hopefully.",1230076800,,561,4.063063063063063

3563639,4,B001F2U6XI,"The First of 3 (as of 12/06/08) Seasons of Zero no Tsukaima, and the only season currently available domestically Geneon had this licensed for quite some time but folded up shop right before they released it.  Thankfully Funimation is now the american distro for Geneon titles so we get to see it.  Overall if you can get past the Main Loli Character this series has its good points.  The first seasons is mostly comedic in nature, but if you follow this series beyond the first season it does get pretty serious and somewhat dark later on (season 2, and parts of season 3).  No real comment on the Dub, since I haven't watched it in english and I don't plan on it.  I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10 rating, while not anywhere near some of the best anime series I have seen its better then your current flavor of the month (insert title here) animes.",1228521600,5,849,4.348101265822785
3563640,5,B001F2U6XI,The Familiar of Zero offers a hilarious and unique story line about a Japanese boy that enters a world of magic. The graphics are pretty good and the voice cast is one of the best. I would recommend this to anyone who watches anime and comedies. It by far my most favorite anime in existence.,1227571200,5,292,4.327272727272727
3563641,5,B001F2U6XI,"This is such a refreshing, fun series!  I loved everything about it.  Louise reminds me of Lina Inverse from Slayers but where Lina would blow everything up on purpose, poor Louise just blows things up on accident.  Everything seems to go wrong that she touches.  Every magic student has to summon a familiar in their second year.  It's a huge thing, and the students are so proud when they finally get their familiar, only Louise screws this up too and in all the history of the school, she is the only one who has ever summoned... a human.

The Japanese boy is quite bewildered to be in a new world with two moons and having a girl claim to be his master (of sorts).  She starts out treating him like a pet/slave (as other familiars are) but it quickly branches out into more than just that.

Great music, a fun plot, solid animation and nice character designs make for a very cute and entertaining anime.  There's plenty of comedy and action and its just a great series overall.  HIGHLY recommended!

This box includes the entire season in three full size cases housed inside a collector's box.",1226966400,21,1097,4.545918367346939
3563662,5,B001F2U6XI,"This box set contains season one (ep. 1-13) of the Familiar of Zero. This is the only Familiar of Zero box set with English dub. This, and the fact that Geneon only produced this box set for about three months (6 years ago), makes this box set extremely rare and subsequently valuable. I paid $170 for mine, and although the condition was reported as ""acceptable"", it appears to be in ""good"" or even ""very good"" condition; $200 is a reasonable price for a good (or good+) conditioned box set at this time. I'm glad I purchased this item. It's well packaged, with colorful and dynamic artwork covering all 3x disc cases. Each disc case contains it's own unique poster--so 3x posters in total. This anime is great. Lots of action, comedy, and romance--this anime gives you what you want to see, and does it in all the right ways.

3563663,5,B001F2U6XI,"Louise is a noble attending a magic academy. In her world, the social status of a person depends on their ability to use magic. Although her family is well respected, Louise hasn't ever successfully used magic. She has earned the nickname ""Zero"", for her 0% success rate. One day, when her class is summoning familiars, she summons a young man from Earth named Seito. She is ashamed that she summoned a peasant. She puts him to work doing her chores, but he quickly grows on her. Seito also has a strange power which has a mysterious connection to Louise's magic. As they become close, the world begins to crumble around them. Their bond will be the only hope for the future.

This anime was a lot of fun. It seems shallow and silly at first, but halfway through a great story develops. I found myself starting to tear up a little bit at times. There are some great characters, and a really good story. The animation and soundtrack are both really well done. The voice acting is slightly above average. There are some suggestive situations in this series, but no sex or nudity. 13 and up is probably a good rating. My only complaint is that this series is broken up into several short seasons. Geneon closed and left only this 1st season behind. It has also been subject to greedy people asking a ridiculous amount for it. You're lucky if you can find it for under $200. I payed too much for this, and it really bugs me, but I really enjoyed this series. I think you should watch it online and decide whether or not to break the bank on this set. I believe this is the only set that is dubbed, so this is really the only option you have if you want to buy it dubbed.",1362700800,3,1666,4.374193548387097
3563664,3,B001F2U6XI,"I have seen all 3 seasons of this show and i loved them and i also can't wait for season four which is hopefully set to air early next year. That being said the price for this item seems way to high. Even if this is a hard to obtain box set it still seems to high. It is totally worth the watch, but purchasing the DVDs at $140 is way to steep. If it were $60-$80 then even for this box set, in my personal opinion, that would be worth it.",1317859200,,439,3.782608695652174
3563665,5,B001F2U6XI,"I remember watching the very first episode for the very first time in Taiwan. I loved it and have been searching for it ever sense, (weak search. More like I wasn't into anime back then).

Finally bought the box set and bummed that there is no second or third season because I would of bought that. The anime is awsome. Its one of those romantic comedies that although the main charaecters are female, the male character Saito is the most important character in the anime. This is a lot of damsel in distress kinda thing. This is one of those animes that you hate the lead female character (Louise) and you feel for the male character (Saito). One can kinda wish Saito was more aggressive and wasn't so timid even though he passionatly doesn't believe in the nobility vs peasent domination. There is a lot of domination themes in here, but in some ways, a lot of this is funny. You also feel that Louises domination is needed because of how weak and useless she is. Saito usually comes to the rescue and Louise resents it because she is nobility vs peasent. This anime plays off that concept and makes it funny, but Im surprised to not hear a lot of jokes from Kirche which was the one that I expected to make the most fun about the issue (Just like Kuriko from Maburaho). I also kinda want to see more of Kirche because she is possibly the only character that presents a very light hearted personality. Plus shes hot (Expected) and its just fun to see her try to seduce Saito. Montmorency is also another character that would be fun to see more of to.

This is Adult anime to. Saito spends most of the time waching lacy panties and there are a lot of breast jokes and flat chested jokes from all sides of the spectrum. Kirche also does a lot of seducing and rubbing breasts with Saito as well. Although its all funny, this is adult content. There are also other aspects to, but can remember.

This is a real cute anime and a lot of fun to watch. This was worth the money and as a newbie anime watcher that just recently started, this was a good one to have in a collection. Not much else to say that hasn't been said before.",1261440000,2,2125,4.347607052896725
3563666,5,B001F2U6XI,This is a great show and and great buy. The boxset comes with some unique artwork and 3 mini posters that all look great! This show is still waiting for it's fourth season Please support by purchasing this set and future releases!,1251849600,,230,4.5
3563667,4,B001F2U6XI,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this anime which I watched with my 10 year old daughter.  Both of us ended up enjoying it a lot.  It's in a girlie (Shojo), crazy style with lots of screeching, squealing and wild antics.  The relationship between the two main characters is sweet (although a little aggressive!) and the story line is nice.  Our major disappointment with the series was how short it was ... only 3 discs.  The story was a bit 'compressed' and had a lot of potential.  It would have been better if it had been told over four or five discs.

I think the sexual references in this anime are pretty strong, too.  If you're concerned about this sort of thing then this isn't an anime to watch with your child.

We are big fans of anime and I wouldn't this as highly as others in the same style, e.g., Fruits Basket, but it's good if your expectations aren't too high.

The packaging is good.  The box is high quality, sturdy cardboard with good artwork.  Inside are three standard DVDs with a small picture booklet inside each one.  The covers are reversible.",1251244800,,1071,4.458762886597938
3563668,4,B001F2U6XI,"Comidramaction! Think of this series as a light Inuyasha, just without the demons and ""sword calls"" (you know like Wind Scar but there are spell calls...but that makes more sense :) The story revolves mostly around Louise (who sucks at magic) and her familiar Saito (who happens to be a human of another dimension). Starts off with some comedy, goes into some drama near the middle of the series and then action. Does it do it well, I think so. Not to much of drama or action, but I don't think the creators of this series wanted to make it too dramatic or with too much action. It mainly is a comedy (which is a good call imho). The first series is definitely a keeper (not too fond of the last series they came out with..too eicchi and no focus on story, but that's another review!). Ok animation (could be better.) Music well, ehhh it's ok, but nothing that really stands out. Voice acting is good (I watched it in Japanese with subs so I can't say anything about the dubs.) In all I say 3.5 for a good story line. I recommend it to 13 yr's older and up.",1242864000,,1057,4.29
3563669,4,B001F2U6XI,"OK, so I really didn't know much about this series before I purchased it.  The DVD formatting isn't great, but it's not bad either.  The voice acting is actually quite good (if you're an anime fan you might even recognize a few voices from other series) and the show itself is really creatively written and orchestrated.  The music fits pretty well too, though it's not quite on par with some of the other shows from around the same time.  All in all, I give it 4/5 stars.",1241222400,,472,4.390804597701149
3563670,5,B001F2U6XI,"Zero No Tsukaima or The Familiar oz Zero. is one of the titles saved and re-issued in 2008 by Funimation Entertainment. The animation is by JC Staff and is rated 13 and up due to the amount of ""tastefully positioned fanservice"" To give a catch-all statement about this series think. ""A Conneticuit Yankee in King Arthur's Court"", by Mark Twain, Meets ""The Taming of the Shrew"", by William Shakespeare, meets ""Harry Potter"" Series by J.K. Rowling. Place in an Anime blender and Voilla!

The story is of a paralel world where magic exists and humans who are able to use it are called Mages, ordinary people are called peasants. Periodically, in this world, gateways open to our world and people get stuck in this magicly charged land. One day Saito our hero, is walking through the streets of a major Japanese city. He sees a gateway that aparently no one else sees and is sucked in. To his horror, he is now the quintisential stranger in a strange land. Aparently now the familiar of an unsuccessful magic girl named Louise, called Louise the Zero by her classmates due to her unsuccessful use of magic. Some ""binding contract is invoked between them when she kisses him.

A binding contract? With no Quid Pro Quo, and no mutual asscent. Well Mr. Saito like any modern human from a 1st world country chooses to ignore most of what his new master Louise says and do his own thing when he chooses. Over the course of the series we see a deepening of Louise and Saito's relationship as he begins to take on a roll as more a protector than as a servant. Louise is clearly attracted to Saito and is insanly jealous when he interacts with other girls. Refering to Saito more than one time as a ""dog"". But her noble standing prevents her from expressing to Saito how she feels about him. Saito for his part grows to respect Louise an possibly even love her in a way, but he is a bit of a lothario and the center of the attention of females other than Louise. That does not in any way make this a harem anime though as Louise exerts her ""ownership"" of Saito drawing him back every time.

The thiteen episodes of this anime were not enough to bring the plot to fruition. A viewer is left wanting more story development and more subtext. I realize that shows like this are cranked out fast and have to ""work for TV"" but it leaves the viewer with some loose ends which this reviewer would like to see tied up. Theres pleanty of room here for a well developed second series or a movie. bt since this was a 2005 title in Japan we probably won't see it.

If you are at all into paralel worlds, magic, or romances I'd recomend the Familiar of Zero for their slate of viewing and a place in their home video/DVD library.",1238976000,,2703,4.4325955734406435

I want to see her voice season 2 and 3.  also the rest of the new and upcoming voice cast is also excellent.

The one plus or negative depending on your experience if they downsampled the japan video masters and audio to to fit on less discs and give Americans a cheaper price.  With modern compression you will hardly notice a difference in the audio or video department unless you have a high end tv and audio setup.
