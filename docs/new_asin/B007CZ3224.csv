HAVE TOO ORDER MORE MOVIES 2 MORE ARE ON MY LIST..",1368230400,,106,3.8636363636363638
5078860,5,B007CZ3224,"This collection has the distinct goal of giving you the best of Batman.  Some are better than ohters. However if you like the caped crusader, you'll like the stories offered here. Like many others; I can't afford the high cost of some of the past volumes of Batman: The Animated Series.  It's not fair that volumes two and three are more than double the actual retail price. This is the next best thing.  The episodes here have more of a punch than the usual Batman fare. We get to see the origin of Harley Quinn.  We get to see Batman make some not so easy decisions in his career.  Bruce Timm, producer and artist, offers what's easily considered the definitive version of Batman.  You can't go wrong on this purchase.",1341792000,4,720,4.5
5078861,3,B007CZ3224,"These are the episodes include in this DVD I would have liked to have seen more from the original Animated series, and they should have thrown in a Batman Beyond Ep for good measure or as a bonus.

Batman: The Animated Series: Heart of Ice (1992)
Batman: The Animated Series: Off Balance (1992)
Batman: The Animated Series: I Am the Night (1992)
The Adventures of Batman & Robin: Avatar (1994)
The Adventures of Batman & Robin: Bane (1994)
The New Batman Adventures: You Scratch My Back (1997)
The New Batman Adventures: Cult of the Cat (1998)
The New Batman Adventures: Legends of the Dark Knight (1998)
The New Batman Adventures: Old Wounds (1998)
The New Batman Adventures: Over the Edge (1998)
The New Batman Adventures: Joker's Millions (1998)
The New Batman Adventures: Mad Love (1998)
The Batman: A Matter of Family (2006)

Heart of Ice is the best Batman episode from a series ever, it was nominated for the Emmy, It gave Mr. Freeze a real back story, that you almost feel sorry for him by the end of the episode.  They butchered the same backstory in Batman and Robin the film.

Off Balance is an okay story featuring Ra's al Ghul and Talia

Joker's Million is another great one where the joker inherits Millions, but the jokes on him when all the money turns out to be counterfeit

Mad Love tells of Harley and the jokers relationship and how they met.

so all in all it's okay, The's rumor of Talia in the dark night rises, so maybe these are all tie-in eps.

I would have liked to I almost Got him which is one of my favorites,  The Joker's Favor,The Trial, House and Garden,Perchance to Dream and The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne, would have all been great to see in a best of, and great bonus Ep from Batman beyond would have been Out of the Past",1341792000,20,1761,4.478125

8514732,5,B007CZ3224,"I really enjoyed these cartoons. Co-stars Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl in some of the cartoons. Other appearances include Catwoman and Harley Quinn. Joker, Mr. Freeze, Bane, Penguin are some of the bad guys. I'm unsure when these cartoons are made, but quality are no different than current Cartoon Network shows. Great for kids and adults too.",1475539200,,345,5.178571428571429
8514733,2,B007CZ3224,"Unlike the Best of Superman, the Best of Batman has content limited to the Animated Series. I would had liked to see various animated cartoons throughout the years.
I would had liked to see Filmation, Hanna Barbera along with the Warner Brothers (Bruce Timm). That would make the DVD more interesting.",1471392000,4,301,4.921568627450981
