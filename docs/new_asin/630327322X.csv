7843318,4,630327322X,We couldn't find a digital or DVD version of this movie but its one my husband loves so he bought it on VHS and a VHS player just for this movie. It's corny and whatever but he loved it from a long time ago. I had never seen it before we bought it and I think its okay. I probably wouldn't think it was so great but hey its alright.,1365292800,,332,3.757142857142857
7843319,3,630327322X,"Getting In is a simple film from '94 about a kid, who doesn't really want to be a doctor--it's more a matter of family tradition--trying to get into Johns Hopkins and getting caught up in the murder of the other students on the waiting list. The story isn't all that great and Stephen Mailer's performance is weak. Kristy Swanson does a pretty good job--for her that is. There are two surprising cameos, Matthew Perry and Calista Flockhart, both before they became big stars. Maybe I'm too used to Chandler and Ally, because I felt that they weren't right for their parts. The real gem of the movie is Dave Chappelle's character. And Andre McCarthy plays a dark role, and surprisingly pulls it off rather well.",1071100800,2,710,4.688
7843320,3,630327322X,"It is light unambitious film that tickles the funny bone a fair bit with ghoulish jokes about killing people with style.  This is not a bad film but it never reaches the true tongue-in-cheek styles of ""How I Got Into  College"" or the morbid grace of ""Heathers"".  Somewhere it  falls short and in this kind of picture that means the script.  The  dialogue is not snappy enough and you kind of wish the psychopath would  kill the pathetic hero of the picture.  But there are a few chuckles that  beat other 3 a.m. cable fare.  The acting is not bad but I don't get the  feeling it was suppose to be great either.  The comedy arrangement is one  innocent man, one deranged psychopath, one pretty co-ed, and a Med-School  Wait List.  So if you don't mind guessing the end at the beginning and  never being truly surprised then this picture can give you some interesting  laughs.",914371200,2,874,4.5
