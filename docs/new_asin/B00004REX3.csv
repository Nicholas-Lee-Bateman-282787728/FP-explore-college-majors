8423230,4,B00004REX3,"This was the first Soft Bodies video I've seen, and it definitely delivers if you like your nudity sexy but not explicit. The ladies featured are Taylor St. Claire, Mason Marconi and Becky LeBeau. LeBeau not only appears  in the video, she is also the producer, executive producer and sings most  of the songs on the soundtrack!  LeBeau is a very impressive and remarkable  woman, and not just her extremely gorgeous body, but her intelligence and  talent in being one of the few women who run the show in the soft-core  video industry.
I enjoyed Becky's and Mason's segments the most, and  Taylor's segment is fine as well.  My only problem with the Soft Bodies  videos is that they only feature 3 women (in fairly long segments) on each  tape, and if you don't like 1 or more of the ladies,  you probably won't be  satisfied. But it's definitely a high-quality production with high-quality  babes. Another plus is that it's shot on tape, (giving you that live feel)  and not on film like Penthouse and those awful Playboy videos.",954201600,,1031,4.687150837988827
