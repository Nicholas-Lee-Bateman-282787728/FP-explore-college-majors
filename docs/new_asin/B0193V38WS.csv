With time, I see that that question may be answered. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that SKYFALL would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film, but something more. It seemed like something special as going on. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film, but that is the key. I got a feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. Perhaps one must reflect on it I suppose. SKYFALL is a good Bond film and with the release of SPECTRE and the tie-ins with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, these are two Bond films that are strengthening Daniel Craig's tenure as 007. If you are going to see SPECTRE, I suggest you see QUANTUM OF SOLACE and SKYFALL first.",1477526400,,1406,4.4324324324324325
