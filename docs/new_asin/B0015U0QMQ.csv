However, it is an example of how Clayne Crawford (Lethal Weapon series) got his start.  No real plot. Horrible language but I expected that. There are a few memorable lines but I am very glad I paid so little for it.",1491264000,,344,4.444444444444445
8259949,3,B0015U0QMQ,"I have always wanted to see more of Shanna Collins since Swingtown. This is not a good Shanna Collins film. Suprisingly, Vampire Diaries' Candace Accola has quite a role here.
Just to guide people: This movie is dirty without being sexy. It inhabits the criminal edge of the sex/escort industry- and it's no fun. It is unkind to the idea of saving people involved in this. It's a grim and realistic look inside- and that's all. Don't pull back this curtain out of mere curiosity. It is one of the least 'erotic"" or 'sensual"" films out there.",1466899200,2,541,4.587628865979381
8259950,3,B0015U0QMQ,It is very hard to understand what the movie is trying to show.,1440460800,,63,3.923076923076923
8259951,2,B0015U0QMQ,"OK, it really is a terrible movie, but you probably knew that.  The pacing is bad.  The characters are not developed at all and the story is a cheap cardboard cutout of a real issue.  It's also, overall, kind of deliberately unpleasant, which would be fine if it was a sincere story or documentary, but it's not.  It's too fake to be gripping and too unpleasant to be entertaining.  As a whole, it doesn't work at all.

The occasional scene is fun, in a b-movie torture porn flick kind of way, but that's like 2 fun minutes in a 2 hour pile of junk, and I think the makers of the movie realized that when they put Brittney Snow and the punching scene on the cover.  Britney sells, but the movie stinks.",1435449600,2,702,4.2727272727272725

8259953,4,B0015U0QMQ,A good movie that will keep you in your seat but not a major award winner. This isn't a movie for everyone.,1376006400,,107,3.909090909090909
8259954,4,B0015U0QMQ,"I was surprised by this film.  I expected yet another B grade film for immature gore and titty hounds.  Instead, I found a film that refused to sensationalize the world of the sex industry and refused to cheapen itself with gratuitous scenes of sex and nudity.  Kudos to the film makers for attempting to make an ambitious movie about the lives of young men and women who find themselves caught in the sad, greedy, exploitative world of the sex industry.  The plot is complex enough to keep the viewer's attention.  This could have been a five star film -- if there had been better character development.  Although the sex workers and the sexually provocative high school women are portrayed sympathetically, they remain uni-dimensional and flat. Because we fail to get a richer sense of the characters, the movie lacks an emotional repertoire.  Melancholia is the only emotion it doled out.  Nonetheless, if you appreciate an honest look at the sex industry, this movie is worth watching.",1374537600,,989,4.9156626506024095
8259955,5,B0015U0QMQ,well this movie looks like  happiness and crash  if you like this kind  of movie  you will love this one  there is a little longueur  in the middle  but the end  is very good  so i enjoy it a lot,1215993600,,195,3.675
8259956,2,B0015U0QMQ,"Just a forwarning to those of whom were expecting something else.  On The Doll was filmed and edited masterfully.  This was the film's strongest point in my opinion.  Everything else was, ehhhh...  I was looking forward to seeing this for a week or so as I though it sounded interesting, and the fact that it had been totally rented out since it's release date.  Within five or ten minutes one can see the gorgeous camera work with an atmospheric soundscape that seemed to be well done, encompassing fairly shallow acting that seemed to be, not so well done.
Lots of potential threading through this storyline which, cleverly enough, encompassed three different scenarios into one inevitable downward spiral.  Also, for those whom like me, rented this in hopes of some grotesque scenery will be terribly dissappointed.  I believe that the castration that happens within the last five minutes of the film is the only reason the MPAA refused to grant an R rating.  That's all you get here gorehounds, and though the effects were realistic enough, the inclusion of this seemed rather arbitrary, since it was supposedly an accident.  If you want my opinion, stear clear of this and try ""Descent"" with Rosario Dawson.  It is a lot slower paced, but more professionally executed and thus creating more effect.  I tried this one out hoping for lots of sex, drugs, and gore, and was suprised when I became bored with the film's direction, and irritated with the subpar acting.  Just my take...",1214265600,14,1485,4.872509960159363
