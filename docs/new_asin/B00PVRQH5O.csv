8689498,5,B00PVRQH5O,"I really like this dvd alot. The two stories that gave me the chills are: Jackie the little ghost haunting the pool area of the Queen Mary and The story of Herb B. who killed men in his swimming pool. Even when Ghost Adventures went to Fox Hallow Farms, the story gave me the creeps. This video shouldn,t be for kids. I really enjoyed pyshic Peter James trying to get Jackie to speak to him. I also enjoyed listening to Evon Peron talk about her and her family,s experiencing the haunting called The Conjuring. I am really glad I purchased this video. Also this video has the very begining of Ghost Adventures with Zak, Nick and Aaron. Don,t watch this video alone.",1436054400,2,665,4.459016393442623

8689501,5,B00PVRQH5O,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to watch the episode where famous psychic Peter James(with the iconic thick black mustache and white hair) visits the Queen Mary(Ghost Encounters: The Queen Mary/52 mins) in Long Beach, California. Peter James appeared in quite a few of these ghost investigation type shows but he was most famous for his time at the old Queen Mary ship where he did actual paranormal tours late at night in search of lost spirits.

Also appearing in this DVD is Zak Bagans(Ghost Adventures/87 mins), he is the host for the Travel Channel's hit show 'Ghost Adventures'. Zak is a younger, edgier type of host with a loud and aggressive style(as compared to the older and more subdued types that usually host these type of paranormal shows). In this episode, he and co-host Nick Groff visit a couple of creepy, old locations in Nevada where murder and chaos prevailed.

The other episodes on this DVD include 'The Haunting of Fox Hollow Farm'/64 min, 'Ghost Stories: Walking with the Dead'/52 min, and 'Andrea Perron: House of Darkness House of Light'/119 min. If you enjoy watching paranormal/ghost investigation type shows, then this DVD is right up your alley featuring five episodes full of creepy old locations and unexplained hauntings.",1424390400,4,1258,4.985714285714286
