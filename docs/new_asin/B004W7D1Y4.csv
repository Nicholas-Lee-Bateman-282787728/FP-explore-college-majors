8444748,3,B004W7D1Y4,"My review of this is almost exactly same as my review of Andy's Paul Gilbert DVD, summarized below:

This DVD contains 40 licks in the style of Nuno Bettencourt arranged into a complete instrumental tune.

The good elements of this DVD are that the overall tune and individual licks are nice and very well played.
However there are a number of problems prospective buyer should be aware of:

1) No written TAB or music notation, either on-screen or in PDF format
2) Backing track has no chart and is only playable via DVD (no separate audio file)
3) Several licks utilize uppermost frets of 24-fret guitar - unplayable on a 21 or 22 fret guitar

Use of a 24-fret guitar seems a little strange in this case given that Nuno's N4 is a 22 fret model.

Weakness of spoken only format is evident, for example, in Lick 30 where fret 12 D string is mentioned but played on G string, or Lick 33 where tap 17 is mentioned but tap 19 played; if you do buy this you will need to keep your eyes and ears open.

I wasted many hours transcribing this DVD when I should have been just looking at tab and playing it; I will probably not buy any more Lick Library DVDs until they change their format to include some kind of notation.

No dis-respect is meant to Andy James, licks and playing are very good and I also own a few of his CDs.",1336780800,3,1320,4.27710843373494
