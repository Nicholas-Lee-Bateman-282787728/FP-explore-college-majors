5891609,4,B00E5N8OK6,"Spencer (Darryl Dougherty) is a womanizing reality TV show producer. Lance (Ali Adatia) is trying to pitch him a new show, one where you watch a man's life get destroyed. The womanizing Spencer doesn't like it. Reality shows must have scripts because real life is boring. The show must create excitement, and people must believe it.

The film opens with thriller music as we see a woman(Noelle DuBois) hiding a suitcase. The music was far more exciting then what was on the screen. Later that same woman shows up at Spencer's door ""selling cookies.""  Spencer invites her in and she films them having sex using his equipment.  She leaves with the tape. (Who uses tape anymore?)  Spencer believes the woman is certifiably crazy.

When the house loses power, Spencer discovers his security system doesn't have a temporary battery backup, like the one in my trailer. The movie turns into an abduction film.

I fell in love with Noelle during the film, but Dougherty's character was substandard. I also enjoyed the haunting tune  ""Envy"" by Daily Jane played during the end credits. They really needed to have worked that into the film.

5891637,2,B00E5N8OK6,I don't blame the actors on this one.  The script is what made this a bad film.  It almost seems like a porn production trying to go legit.,1435363200,,139,3.9285714285714284

5891645,5,B00E5N8OK6,"This is one hot movie.  Allison is one hell of a sexy lady.  From the start to finish, it stayed very hot,  I hope this director will make more movies in the future.  He has a heck of a talent.",1421971200,,193,3.75
5891646,1,B00E5N8OK6,"very bad acting, B movie quality, boring plot, semi cute girls",1419897600,2,62,4.7272727272727275
5891647,2,B00E5N8OK6,"HAHAHAHA, this film was hilarious from the very beginning.  The dumb looking women in the limo, over acting their parts is something that reminds me of all the gals on Facebook who try to look like models?  Posers?  Everyone wants to be someone, no matter what the cost, even if it means degrading yourself as a play thing for some idiot who imagines He's a star (in his own mind)

Attractive people?  Why yes, they are.  Lousy acting, no doubt.  And I can't imagine what it would be like to ACT a part.  Except I've seen good actors to now the difference.  The one thing that comes to mind, is when a Great or even Good Actor is in ""the Role"" - it isn't forced, it's natural.  Something I've noticed in watching a variety of films.  There's also some human frailty missing, in that no one is THAT self assured.  Which makes it look fake.

Bottom line, I soon lost interest once he started pouring the drinks.",1419292800,3,909,4.37125748502994
5891648,2,B00E5N8OK6,"Good idea for a script of a writer showcasing his script to an aloof producer by unknowingly, to the producer, making him a part of the story. Problem is that the acting was too artificial; the scenarios equally artificial (e.g. when you escape your captors from your suburban home you don't run away going down the middle of a deserted four lane highway where your captors can pursue you in a car - just dumb!); that, and other equally inane decisions made this a tedious movie to watch. Filming and editing made the movie seem as if it was being filmed on a movie set.",1403740800,3,570,4.438095238095238
5891649,2,B00E5N8OK6,I can not recommend this movie. The acting and the cinematography is terrible. There is no suspense. You figure out who-done-it (or who paid to have it done) early on in this film. The description does not quite live up to what the movie actually contains. Just not my cup of tea.,1383868800,3,280,4.403846153846154
8601520,2,B00E5N8OK6,"Interesting story. But I had trouble watching the actors. Could they have found a more revolting male lead, or a less sexy female? I had trouble believing this girl could have any online fans at all, much less lead to any obsession. She is mildly - and I mean MILDLY - attractive. Please.",1529712000,,288,4.452830188679245

8601524,1,B00E5N8OK6,"Well, uhm, what can I say that hasn't been said already? The acting is subpar (very, very subpar), the cinematography is devoid of any merit (it's shot digitally without any filming techniques to make it stand out. It's shot-reverse shot and pans everywhere. Not only that, it seems to be above 30fps, which is strange for film as movies usually cap out at 24fps. Not inherently bad, but I don't see a reason for it in this film at all.) and the characters are forgettable. Even as so bad it's good material, go watch The Room. Nothing about this film stands out.",1497657600,,563,4.529411764705882
