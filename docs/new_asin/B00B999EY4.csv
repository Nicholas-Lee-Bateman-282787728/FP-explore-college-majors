The bullies, Scooter & Robbie reminded me of Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern. But overall the movie needed just a bit more... but for a super family friendly movie; I highly recommend it. The kids will laugh and the younger ones will want to watch it over and over.",1365724800,,393,4.472222222222222
8564584,1,B00B999EY4,"Watchable, somewhat bareable and yet absent of imagination for even the simplest, undemanding kid's movie genre expectations. The film won't excite, amuse or even truly engage due to too much time being made sure to acquire semi-big name stars in the indie film scene and being filmed competently. If it's on FreeForm channel or one of those Christian movie channels, be my guest but this film won't ignite as any fun family gem.",1497916800,,429,4.890410958904109
8564585,3,B00B999EY4,"I got it because a friend of mine was in it. This movie is okay for what it is. It's very generic. The kid doesn't seem to have a bright future in acting though. It's a direct to dvd kids movie. It's not gonna be stellar. This is coming from a teenager, btw. Overall, it would be good to keep kids occupied on a long trip, but it's not like Frozen or anything.",1496793600,,360,3.9452054794520546

If you ever wondered what was in the briefcase in ""Pulp Fiction"", this movie might provide the answer.",1424131200,,141,4.64

8564589,5,B00B999EY4,"My kids really enjoyed this.  It kept their attention and I love hearing them giggle.  They are ages 7, 6, and 4.  The four year old didn't understand everything happening, but it kept his attention for most of the film.  This is a great accomplishment for a busy four year old boy!  As a parent, I really appreciated that I didn't have to worry about the content.  I'm sure the kids will request it again for movie night.",1373414400,2,422,4.346153846153846
8564590,5,B00B999EY4,I purchased this movie because I'm on twitter with Tanner Fontana and he suggested it. Definitely some good acting on all the kids parts. The story line may seem like a kids movie but I suggest this movie to all parents. Take the time to really listen to your kids. Great movie.,1373241600,,278,4.365384615384615
