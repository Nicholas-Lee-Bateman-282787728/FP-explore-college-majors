6993554,5,B00SWFM80U,"When you're afraid to fight for someone and decide to PAY someone else to end the trouble (and the troublemaker), you best be really sure whom you are paying to do the job. This movie's somewhat shocking violence may have you asking, ""WHAT just happened?"" and you may also be going back to watch more than one scene again to verify the horror.

A powerful film with an unexpected ending, NOT for the squeamish.",1431820800,6,410,4.54054054054054

6993584,4,B00SWFM80U,"The movie may seem a little slow getting started but it is necessary to develop the characters and plot. Without giving away the twists of the plot, it is enough to say that it can be looked at from a couple of different perspectives. It could be what happens when well-meaning family butt into their adult offspring's business or it can be seen as an immature young man ruining his own, and his mother's life due to his lack of considering the full ramifications of his actions.",1458086400,,479,4.517241379310345

6993593,5,B00SWFM80U,Movie was definitely enjoyable. It was very intense. It shows the human element of people and how one can be pushed to the limit.,1453766400,,129,4.416666666666667

6993596,4,B00SWFM80U,"I liked it a lot. To me it was slow paced, but when the story really unfolded i was intrigued. The thought of defending your sisters honor but when its all said and done, the brother is left second guessing his own actions.",1449187200,,223,4.209302325581396

6993610,4,B00SWFM80U,"A compelling look at the manifestations of schizophrenia.  Very well acted, directed and produced.  Could a person so afflicted really function in society as portrayed here?  Doubtful.  Nonetheless, a solid film worthy of attention.",1445385600,,232,5.735294117647059

6993615,5,B00SWFM80U,This movie is typical of a lot of under publicized movies.  It is thought provoking and intelligent and full of wonderful actors.  Even though it is violent and dark somehow it isn't depressing.  I would say it's one of the best movies I have seen this year.,1441324800,,258,4.446808510638298

6993618,5,B00SWFM80U,"This is a film that is hard to stop thinking about.  The plot is character-driven with a gritty realistic outcome.  The most compelling scene for me was the sister's interaction with the hired killer, the irony of which would never be discovered by her clueless brother.  The philosophy of the sociopathic killer is compelling.  In fact, there isn't a single character whose motivations aren't interesting to consider.  Way better than your typical bad guy suspense film.",1440201600,3,471,5.144736842105263
6993619,4,B00SWFM80U,"This was a slow moving but compelling story about domestic violence and how it can spiral out of control with not one person thinking about long term consequences because they just can't get out of their own tunnel vision emotions.

The only part that didn't seem quite real to me was in the diner when the brother truly started to understand he was in over his head.  Anyone who couldn't control himself even fractionally better than that man did would have long ago been at best a lifer in prison or dead.  A little more 'controlled' rage might have been more effective, although the suddenness of that moment sure got my attention.

Regardless, after that scene there was no turning back.  Realization set in but it was too late.  You knew you were watching a train wreck in progress, but you knew that when you started.  It is always a train wreck, you're only waiting for the details.

Nice job.",1440028800,10,900,4.58125

6993621,5,B00SWFM80U,"All of us movie junkies love indie flicks.  Here is a new, 2015 thriller, on prime.  You aren't exactly on the edge of your seat, but you have scooted up, and are leaning forward.

Better than most non-prime, big production movies, we pay for.  Plus, the husband looks and acts just like Bradley Cooper.  He doesn't have those blue eyes, but he has everything else.

PS no blood, guts, or sex.",1439769600,6,393,4.464788732394366
6993622,5,B00SWFM80U,"This is why I love independent films so much more than the 'blockbuster' type. Last night I watched a movie with Angelina Jolie I could barely finish - it was awful. I'd never heard of this one when I saw it on Netflix. Excellent movie - it is depressing, so if you're looking for 'upbeat', look elsewhere. The acting was fantastic by all involved, and the storyline very realistic. Highly recommend.",1439424000,3,400,4.647887323943662
6993623,5,B00SWFM80U,"A dark and disturbing movie. Well done with terrific acting especially Chris Mulvet who gives one of the best performances I,ve ever seen. Should have won him the highest awards of the year.",1439164800,,190,4.787878787878788

6993625,5,B00SWFM80U,Truly a great watch!,1438473600,,20,4.25
6993626,4,B00SWFM80U,Good solid movie. I wasn't sure what to expect but it kept a steady momentum til the end.  Not entirely unpredictable but had enough suspense to make me wonder if it would play out the way I was thinking it might. Two parallel storylines of the sister's attempt to save her marriage and her brother's boggled hit on her husband.  I think the most poignant moment comes near the end when the husband who has been seemingly doing all the right things seems to stumble and at that point I was left wondering if indeed the brother was right in what he initiated. Worth watching.  Some brief cold-blooded killing and minimal language but otherwise pretty mild for an R rating.,1437782400,3,671,4.575

Her mom Angela (Joelle Carter) berates her brother Gordon (Kenny Wormald) for not standing up and protecting his sister. Gordon attempts to redeem himself by hiring a hitman (Chris Mulkey) as the couple works to get back together.

The film was well acted. It has a message that living with your deeds is sometimes harder than being dead. It has the same message as ""John Doe: Vigilante"" but not nearly as fun. The film is a drama and for a long time it doesn't seem like it goes anywhere.
