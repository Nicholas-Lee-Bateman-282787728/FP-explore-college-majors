Warm Up (dribbling, passing, moving,  etc.)
Individual and Team Techniques (offense and defensive tactics. 1v1, 2v1, 2v2 games)
Group Tactics (principals of play, various games - 3v2 goal, 4v4, group defending)
Team Patterns and Tactics (4-4-2 positional play, 4-4-3 positional play)",1415145600,,565,5.314606741573034
8317144,3,B001L487UO,"When I was growing up, soccer was a word, but nobody played it.
You played football, baseball, or basketball.
Now I am the father of a seven year old, and I know nothing about the sport, and they don't teach it here in Florida. You just go out and kick the ball.
Is this video good for children that age? Or is this video geared at people that just want to coach?
If you want to sell this product, the description needs to be better.",1270598400,,433,4.105882352941176
8317145,5,B001L487UO,"I've been a recreational soccer coach for 5 years and have viewed several other coaching DVDs, but this one is one of the best. (David Beckham's DVD is very good also.) I've learned several new drills and coaching points from this set that I haven't been taught before and that will improve my coaching and my team's skills. I'm anxious to begin our Spring season!
Play hard, play smart and have fun.",1235347200,,400,4.569444444444445
