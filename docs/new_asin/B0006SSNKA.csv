2193683,5,B0006SSNKA,"The Punky Brewster saga continues with this fabulous set of Season 2!

Punky Brewster ROCKS!!

This 4 disc set contains all 22 episodes of the 1985-86 season, and 3 hours of the popular Saturday morning animated show It's Punky Brewster, as well as an interview with Helsinki-born actor George Gaynes, who played Henry Warnimont, Punky's foster (and later adoptive) father. An extra special feature of this Season 2 set is a sheet of free Punky Power stickers included in every box. I LOVE Punky Brewster! I've got Punky Power!!

In Season 2, Punky and the gang are back, and a year older. Punky and her friends are now 9 and in the fourth grade with Mr. Mike Fulton, who was introduced at the end of Season 1 as a worker at Fenster Hall, the emergency children's shelter. Now Mike has gotten a job as a teacher, and Punky, Cherie, Allen and Margaux are all in his fourth grade class.

One of the differences between Season 1 and Season 2 is the absence of Eddie, the goofy, and geeky apartment building's maintenance man. Although, I can understand his removal, as this season is primarily about Punky, and the developing relationship with Henry and her friends, I still kind of missed Eddie in the second season. To me, he injected a different kind of humor into the show, with his constant mishaps, and his run-ins with Henry and his wisecracks. Oh well. The show is still terrific anyway. I just kind of missed those scenes, that's all.

Season 2 also deals more with serious issues than they did in Season 1, which though had some heavy episodes (Fenster Hall, I Love You, Brandon, etc.) they weren't as many. In Season 2 there are episodes that deal with drugs and peer pressure (Just Say No), parental kidnapping in custody disputes (Milk Does a Body Good), the consequences of stealing (Christmas Shoplifting) facing one's fears (Urban Fear) gender discrimination (Girls Will Be Boys), compassion for others (The Gift) and more!

But though this season deals with several serious issues, they are presented in such a way that it is suitable for all ages to see. Also, like Season 1, there is no graphic violence, or other inappropriate material.

However, there is one 2 Part episode (The Perils of Punky) in which Punky and her friends find themselves lost in the woods during a camping trip, ending up in a vacant Indian cave, where Punky tells a ghost story that becomes the basis of the episode, which younger children (even some sensitive adults alone at night! LOL!) might find scary.

But other than that ONE 2-part episode, this show is still a WONDERFUL family-friendly show! Out of all the DVD's I've seen, Punky Brewster is one of my favorites! I CAN'T WAIT until all 4 seasons of this wonderful show come out on DVD! I am going to buy them all!

Ever since I got this set, I have been watching it over and over! When and if I have children someday, I want them to watch this great show too! Although at the rate I am watching it now, by then, I may need to buy a whole new DVD set of this series! LOL!!

Like with Season 1, I love ALL the episodes on this set, but I think my favorite episode would have to be the 5 part ""Changes"" episode, because it shows how the love between Henry and Punky has blossomed over the past two seasons, and how although they're not biologically related, these 2 have truly become like father and daughter. Best of all, this 5 episode story arc ends with Punky being officially adopted by Henry!

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster-Season-Two/dp/B0006SSNKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster - Season Two</a>&nbsp;also includes 16 episodes of the animated series, ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons, as well as an interview with George Gaynes (who played Punky's foster/adoptive father, Henry Warnimont)

However, even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have one complaint, and a couple of quibbles about it.

First of all, my complaint (and IMHO, the biggest problem) with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!

Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding ANOTHER cardboard box that unfolds and folds up/out (the style used for THIS set, as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster-Season-One/dp/B00020X83Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster - Season One</a>), I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>&nbsp;among others!) instead!

I am kind of anal about DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.

But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

In addition, I also have a couple quibbles about this DVD set.

The first is that just like the previous season, there is still NO special audio like Dolby Digital, Surround Sound, THX, or DTS. While the picture and sound are still relatively good, considering that this show was made in the 80's, it might have been EVEN BETTER, if it had been remastered with a 21st century audio system.

My second quibble is that there is still NO closed-captioning or subtitles available on this DVD set. As I said in my review for Season 1, this is a minor quibble, though many other DVD box-sets, at least have this one basic feature. Unfortunately Punky Brewster does not. Not only that, but with some of the other DVD's that do not have closed captions available, they have at least enabled TV captioning, such that if a TV has a closed-captioning feature built in, then it can still be possible to get captions. But with Punky Brewster, this feature has NOT been enabled, so it does not work.

It's a shame because everything else about this DVD set is so great. I just wish that Shout! Factory had considered those with disabilities or language issues and thought to include closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!). Not only so that those who don't speak English, as well as those with hearing impairments (the deaf, the elderly, etc.) can watch this wonderful show, but also because sometimes, when Punky or another character is talking quietly or mumbling, its kind of hard to understand, and closed captions would help to decipher mumbled and/or softer-spoken dialogue. Naturally, they would need to raise the price a little to cover that, but I, for one would not have minded (and would not mind) paying a little more for those important features when buying a DVD or especially a DVD box set!

Punky Brewster is still TRULY a GEM!!

Its really too bad that they just don't make shows like this anymore. I grew up in the 80's and this show is an instant blast to my childhood. The 80's had so many WONDERFUL (not to mention mostly family-friendly!). Punky Brewster, Webster, Mr. Belvedere, Perfect Strangers, Who's the Boss?, Full House, Family Matters, Baby Talk, Head of the Class, Family Ties, Growing Pains, Picket Fences, Life Goes On, and more!

Unlike now, when TV is clogged with crap like the reality show rage of Survivor, Fear Factor, and other equally revolting junk.

Punky Brewster is a MUST for all 80's fans & 80s kids like me. I strongly encourage not only Punky Brewster fans, but ANYONE with young kids, anyone who is planning on having kids someday, or anyone who liked this show and wants to see a wholesome, sweet, and QUALITY ""family-friendly"" show (though admittedly, on occasion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster/dp/B00020X83Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster</a>&nbsp;CAN get a bit treacly saccharine-sweet) that everyone can enjoy, to buy this set of Punky Brewster! You won't be sorry! I sure wasn't, and I play these DVDs often!

I LOVE PUNKY BREWSTER!

Punky Brewster RULES! I've got PUNKY POWER!! :D

 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1112227200,15,8967,5.161268090971744
2193684,5,B0006SSNKA,"Another great DVD collection of Punky Brewster is included in the second season set. I think they only bad point to make on the DVD is that it was not encoded in stereo, as it had originally been back when it was first aired... infact many of the episodes on the disk say 'in stereo where available', but it's not, and a funny muffled sound is present when music or audience laughter is heard.

It was good to see George Gaynes in the interview on this DVD, as well as Ami Foster and Cherie Johnson on the first season DVD.. I am told that the actors who played Allen and Mike Fulton will be on the third disk, leaving Soliel to do her interview on the final season.

I gotta give this DVD 5 stars!",1108598400,5,698,4.162962962962963
2193685,5,B0006SSNKA,"I was only a year old when Punky Brewster first aired on NBC.  I am now 21 and have been waiting for this show to be on DVD since it went off the air as reruns when i was in the 4th grade...about 1994.  I think Punky was my idol.  I loved everything about her and the fact that I looked like her.  Its so great to watch all these episodes now, because its hard to even remember them.  I remember the characters and some stories, but not well enough. I get so excited to come home after going to school (college!) LOL and watch a few Punky episodes. Its funny how much things change.  I loved all the episodes, but ""Perils of Punky"", the 2 part episodes were so strange!  I don't know if little kids were enjoy it, but its Punky so its ok.  I just wasn't thrilled with those episodes.

  I also loved that there were stickers!!!!!  I hope that they continue putting out the rest of the episodes of Punky.  As someone else has mentioned, the cartoons are a great bonus!  I loved the saturday morning cartoon and we wouldn't be able to have them w/out these DVD's.  I also hope that the next DVD set has an interview w/Soleil because that would make the set complete.  I think its only fitting that she talk about the show that launched her career.

  If you're looking for something to remind you of your childhood in the 80's...this is it!  My boss's daughter (and my friend) is 10 years old and I have her hooked on Punky.  Her mom watched it as a teenager, and likes that I have been buying them and sharing them with her.  I love to see that kids now days are able to see something WORTH watching.  Shows today just aren't what the 80's and early 90's were.",1107993600,9,1659,4.196825396825397

Can't wait to re-live those classic moments and cool treehouse set again. These Punky dvd's are loaded with extra features like the cartoon series and interviews... value for  money at it's best!

Unfortunately the cover art is exactly the same as Season One with the exception of an orange background... how unoriginal and dare I say cheap! Please Shout! Factory... change it for the sake of the fans! The dvd's will be more sought after if they had different covers.",1103155200,,577,4.76

I've always teased my 8 year old calling her Punky because she has a very unique fashion sense. When I saw that the first three season were available on Instant Streaming on Amazon (we have Prime so they are free) I couldn't wait to watch them with her.

We've been watching them over the Christmas break and she loves them and so do I. These shows are wonderful. They deal with real world kid problems head on, no punches pulled. Real financial loss, drugs, abandonment, parental illness, even an episode where the whole class watched the space shuttle blow up live on TV. Night and day from any of the stuff/crap you see today on Disney Channel or Nick.

I can't imagine a network having the courage to make shows like these today. They are honest and forthright, no candy coating, no drama. The kids look real and act age appropriate - she's precocious with being pretentious and no one is dressed in clothes that cost more than the rent.",1356652800,,1105,4.433497536945813

Punky Brewster, this is a total blast from the past! I wish they still had this show on TV, but I must say DVD is better!
To anyone unfamiliar with Punky, it is full of wholesome, safe kid-friendly entertainment but also shows morals without being preachy and puts all of it
into language that kids can understand. I strongly recommend it!
As a kid I liked watching this show when it was on (from what little I remember)
And as an adult I STILL like it! They don't make shows like this anymore, Punky Brewster is one of a kind!

2193739,5,B0006SSNKA,"Punky season 2 continues with the same types of stories as before.  Some changes were made, such as Mike Fulton being the kids' teacher now.  It's just as good as the first season, though.  Part of the fun of the show is seeing the guest stars, too.

My favorite episodes are:  The K.O. Kid-Punky stands up to a bully; Punky's Treehouse-with teamwork, the gang builds a great treehouse; Baby Buddies-Punky and Cheri start a babysitting business; Tap Your Troubles Away-Punky can't dance; Just Say No-Punky and Cheri join the Chiclets, and learn an anti-drug lesson.  Soleil is shown at a real Just Say No campaign at the end of the episode; Love Thy Neighbor-on Halloween, Punky helps out a neighbor; The Gift-Punky's school custodian and friend discovers that she has a hidden talent; Milk Does a Body Good-guest star Candace Cameron is a girl with a secret that Punky and Cherie help uncover; Christmas Shoplifting-one of 2 guest appearances by Peter Billingsley, aka Ralphie in A Christmas Story.  He teaches Punky how to shoplift, and she and Mike get in trouble.

Like the first season's episode that taught about the loss of a pet, this season has a few special episodes that deal with serious issues, such as the one about the Challenger explosion, and the 5 part Changes that deals with Henry being ill and almost losing custody of Punky.

Comes with a sheet of stickers, and the bonus features are good.  Especially the cartoon, It's Punky Brewster.  Fun.

Great show, good for all ages.",1259539200,,1496,4.80078125

2193755,5,B0006SSNKA,"The release of this classic children's series has undoubtedly delighted many ""1980's kids"" who remember watching the show. Just as sweet and engaging as it always used to be, ""Punky Brewster"" is great to introduce to a whole new generation of children (but, of course, those of us who are still ""kids at heart"" will probably enjoy it just as much, if not more!)

Season 1 focused mainly on the shocking impact that Punky's sudden appearance had in the life of Henry Warnimont, an originally grumpy old man who was used to living as a hermit in his own little apartment. Punky gradually decorated his life, but she herself was also going through insecurity and fear of abandonment.

While Season 1 was mostly about Henry and Punky seeking to create a whole new family dynamic for themselves, Season 2 zooms in on Punky, her friends and her 4th grade teacher. Henry is now a warm and devoted fatherly figure to this little girl, and it appears that the writers used this season to really take off with the storyline. Issues pertaining to CPR and drug use are presented with an innocent ""Punky"" touch, and the season ends with an incredible bang when Henry finally adopts Punky as his own. The 5-part episode ""Changes"" is beautifully done and perhaps the biggest success in the show's 4-year run. Here, you get to see how much this old man and little girl love each other and how difficult it was for them to finally get to that glorious end result of being adopted as father and daughter. I often wonder why they didn't save that for the series finale, where it may have fit in on a much more emotional level, but I guess there could have been a variety of reasons for that.

I have loved having Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and cannot wait for Season 3 to come out in the summer. It is, however, a whole different experience to watch this show as an adult. You may be surprised to find how cheesy and silly the storylines are, but as another reviewer here has said, it's important to remember that the series was written for kids. It was not geared to be a family show, but rather something for the young crowd. The jokes are a bit goofy and it is clearly a very youthful rendition of innocence in childhood. In any case, it has all the fun and cutesiness to attract young viewers and is innocent and sweet enough to reel in older crowds, as well.

Soleil Moon Frye did a terrific job with this series--for a little kid, she sure had a lot of talent and was capable of transferring a lot of childlike spirit to the screen. She and George Gaynes worked very well alongside one another, and that little Cherie Johnson was always a wonderful asset to the show. Sweet, funny and irresistably charming, she had the most adorable presence. Then, of course, there was Susie Garrett, who was very funny and also brought some great humor to the episodes through her interactions with Gaynes.

Good acting, a very sweet plot, and genuinely clean 30-minute fun for everyone. What more can you ask for??",1142640000,4,2984,4.518518518518518
2193756,5,B0006SSNKA,Does anyone know when Season 3 of Punky Brewster will be out? I am looking for my granddaughter. She loves Seasons 1 and 2 and she can't wait to see Season 3.,1141776000,3,158,3.96875
2193757,5,B0006SSNKA,"Punky is best at 3 am with a tub full of gummi worms and a good friend. This is perhaps the absolute best bad show ever shown on television. You are either in one of two camps: so cheesy you want to pull your hair out and run away screaming, or loving every minute of it and laughing at how the jokes are almost parodies of themselves. Punky is way more entertaining and campy than any Full House episode. It tries so hard to be politically correct that it isn't anymore. Its just great.  Some of the very best episodes are on this season, such as the one where they get stuck in the cave, and the one where Cherie gets locked in the freezer and almost dies! That's the one everyone remembers from their preschool years. Its lots more fun to watch with someone so you can go back and forth saying clever things like , ""That would never happen!"". All in all, if you don't like Punky, I will probably never understand you. But that's ok, because you and I are just internet anonymoties. I need to get back to work now. Go out and buy this.",1132012800,6,1037,4.211055276381909
2193758,5,B0006SSNKA,"I first bought Punky Brewster Seasons 1 and 2 for me...it was like going back to my childhood, I loved re-watching these episodes that had me glued to the TV as a kid. I don't want to bash a lot of the kids programming that's on TV now a days, but there's nothing that compares to the simplicity and warmth that this show emulates. I gave these seasons to my neice(8 years old) and nephew(11 years old) and they are hooked! They are begging me for the third season, but I keep telling them that it's not out yet! So in the meantime they're re-watching season 1 and 2 over and over! The extra's are great, the show is smart and sweet that parents will not be annoyed at watching this with their children.

So please, let us go back to pig-tales, big bows and those different colored socks...a time of innocence, and that all-encompassing free spirit!",1120262400,3,849,4.407643312101911

I was so excited to find them on Amazon (and at a great price!).  I ordered it  and we have watched it many times.  I find it refreshing compared to so many of the current shows that are marketed towards preteens today.  Keep in mind the picture quality is the same as it was when the show's first aired!  It took a while for my kids to get used to the grainy appearance (after all the HD programs that they watch!).  Once they got passed that, they love the show!",1491350400,,588,4.0964912280701755

It is so fun to see her laughing and identifying with the true childhood thoughts and feelings of young children. This show does not present the children as preteens as shows do now.
