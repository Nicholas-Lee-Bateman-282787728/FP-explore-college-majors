In Myrna Loy's first talkie, the bandito El Malo (Bohr), a sort of Mexican Robin Hood, is annoyed by a WANTED poster that skews his handsome face and offers only 1K for his capture. Plans for revenge on the town's sheriff (Miller) are set aside when El Malo visits a local cantina and sees his old flame, Carmita (Loy) is a dancer there. Their renewed friendship upsets Carmita's dance partner/current boyfriend (Burt), who is mortified when El Malo cuts in on their tango.

The spurned boyfriend waits for a chance to make the outlaw pay...with his life. An opportunity to strike comes when El Malo witnesses from afar a stagecoach robbery and discovers that one of the three men responsible is the town's mayor, Seth Landport (Morgan). El Malo tells Landport to meet him later that night at the cantina. This is when the still-angry boyfriend makes his move...
