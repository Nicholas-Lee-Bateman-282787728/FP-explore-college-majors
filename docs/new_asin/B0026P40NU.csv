3856251,5,B0026P40NU,"The characters are all members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and very well researched. After studying art history for years it was so much fun to see Rossetti and Burns-Jones fleshed out in such an authentic and endearing way and after 30 years as a painter I find things have not changed that much in the art world.

However, this great BBC series made me a fan of an artform so much so that I am reading the book this show was based off of, searching out museums in hopes I can see pieces in person and wanting to learn more about the movement & the other artists. I really enjoyed the entire cast; the stories behind these artists definitely keep the show rolling and still barely touch the surface of the PRB circle...

It's a wonderful show and still only a peak into those that made up the PRB.",1295308800,5,560,4.137614678899083

3856255,1,B0026P40NU,"I cannot believe anyone who cared for the Pre-Raphaelites had anything to do with this production. After the first two episodes, I considered it passable, though I thought John Ruskin was treated shabbily. After that, it all went downhill. I finally threw up my hands and howled at the protrayals of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones; it was evident that the script writer knew NOTHING about the two men, who were made to look like imbiciles, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum in matching purple waistcoats. William Morris was a true polymath: father of the arts and crafts movement, socialist, medievalist, calligraphist, printer, and early environmentalist, and to dismiss him, as this travesty does, as a loutish, stammering fool, is unforgivable.

Though some critics have praised the set design, no one has pointed out the ham-fisted attempts to reproduce some of the artists' paintings used in the production. You did not need a book to hand to see how wretched Rossetti's ""Bocca Baciata"" was rendered. And whilst on the subject -- why on earth would you have a script that went beyond the original PRB? Jane Morris was so striking as to be impossible to cast. Only a credulous fool could suspend disbelief long enough to credit that the actress playing the role could inspire the lust Rossetti feels when they first meet. She looks NOTHING like Jane Morris.

If anyone out there wants to know a little about Rossetti, Morris, Ruskin, and Burne-Jones, they ought to read:
Oswald Doughty's and Jan Marsh's biographies of Rossetti
Fiona MacCarthy's magisterial biography of William Morris
Tim Hilton's exhaustive biography of John Ruskin
Lady Burne-Jones's Memorials of her husband (and the forthcoming biography of Burne-Jones, by Fiona MacCarthy).

""Desperate Remedies"" is a desperate, rubbish treatment of these four men, in particular.

Give this a miss.",1281139200,68,1860,5.210702341137123

The series is a look at the life of the Pre Raphaelites and tries to show why they were do revolutionary. Today they have a very staid and boring reputation, but their art took the world by storm.
So, strap on your seatbelts and take a roller coaster ride through the lives of four young artists and their models as they drink, take drugs, whore and paint themselves into a frenzy. The device of a totally fictional ""brother"" as a narrator works beautifully.",1263686400,24,606,4.278260869565218
3856257,5,B0026P40NU,"Notwithstanding the louche, proto-punk appeal of the leading actors, this is more than just a romp dealing with the ""alpha-fops"" who founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  The name reflected their rejection of Raphael's ""grand manner"" as they championed a more realistic style combined with symbolism (mostly Christian and mythological).

Peter Bowker's well-judged script focuses on the professional and personal lives of the charismatic Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the urbane John Everett Millais, and the manic William Holman Hunt.  The dialogue blends Victorian idiom with contemporary expressions and delivery.  The lush production is based on Franny Moyle's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperate-Romantics-The-Private-Lives-of-the-Pre-Raphaelites/dp/1848540507/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites</a>. A brash, fantastically comedic glam-rock score by Daniel Pemberton accompanies scenes of artistic creation, of sex, and of the Brotherhood swaggering abreast through London asserting their brilliance.

Using a fictional narrator (the diffident but awestruck diarist Fred Walters), the dramatisation remains historically faithful.  Flame-haired hat-shop girl turned model/Muse Lizzie Siddal, models for Millais's iconic ''Ophelia'' in a full bath warmed by dozens of candles; Charles Dickens pours scorn on Millais's ''Christ in the House of His Parents,'' accusing it of blasphemy;  the repressed influential critic John Ruskin (Tom Hollander - wonderful) is sexually repelled by his wife Effie, leaving the way open for her to fall in love with the engaging, affable Millais.

Pacy and racy, the story follows the hungry, ambitious group through the  dingy brothels and shops, on their search for Muses and models; in their studios, getting and losing inspiration - and having sex; humbled by old fogeys, while seeking sponsorship at Royal Academy exhibitions.  Oozing talent and testosterone, Rossetti (Aidan Turner), emerges as the leader of the pack, although the personalities are all distinctive and beautifully acted.

For some of the Brotherhood and their models, dark outcomes lay ahead (notably not Millais - he became President of the R.A.) But that's another story.  For now, this is a very watchable account of the bright young things in the prime of their inspired lives.",1248393600,59,2391,6.190332326283988

3856286,4,B0026P40NU,"A six-part miniseries about the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, composed of Dante Gabrielle Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, and John Everett Millais, is a great idea  in theory. Their lives and works were fascinating, though right from the opening text of ""Desperate Romantics"" it's made clear that certain dramatic liberties have been taken. As is written at the start of each episode: the Pre-Raphaelites were innovative and daring, and this show ""follows in that inventive spirit.""

So you can toss aside any expectations about historical accuracy. There's no mention of Lizzie's miscarriages, Fred Walters is a complete fabrication, and Christina Rossetti is omitted entirely. Instead series takes a deliberate modern take, depicting the brotherhood in much the same light as modern day rock stars, and focusing less on their artwork than their love lives. Throw in plenty of sex, nudity, rivalry and intrigue, and you've got ""Desperate Romantics"".

It's through the eyes of reporter Fred Walters (an original character created for the show) that we meet the Brotherhood: hedonistic Gabriel, passionate Hunt (nicknamed ""Maniac"") and introverted Millais. They're on the lookout for patrons and muses, the former to be found in writer/critic John Ruskin (to lend them money, credence and moral certitude), and the latter a range of young ladies from prostitutes to milliners.

It's the likes of Lizzie Siddle (a hat shop girl), Annie Miller (a working girl) and Effie Grey (the unhappy wife of John Ruskin) that are the centrepiece of the show, simultaneously frustrating and inspiring our artists. In many ways they're treated poorly  even abominably  whether it's Ruskin's neglect of his wife, Gabriel's faithlessness to Lizzie, or Hunt's ongoing demands that Annie learn to be a lady before marriage, rendering all of them little more than objects to be used and discarded.

In this sense the miniseries might well be a tragedy, though often it comes across as a comedy; a sitcom about hapless men struggling for success. They could as well be businessmen or lawyers as artists, as the story is much more interested in their social entanglements than their art  as someone who didn't know an awful lot about their work, the series doesn't provide many insights.

This somewhat uncomfortable blend of tragi-comedy comes to a head with the infamous exhumation of Lizzie Siddle's grave so that Gabriel can retrieve his poetry  at the same time it's depicted as the pinnacle of Gabriel's amorality, it's set to jaunty comedy music. Suffice to say, its tone can be a little strange at times.

The casting is excellent, with Adrian Turner bringing his usual smoulder to Gabriel Rossetti, and Samuel Barnett as a very sweet Millais (who fully deserves his happy ending with Effie). Rafe Spall plays Hunt as a man worthy of the nickname ""Maniac"" and Tom Hollander is a rather despicable John Ruskin. Unfortunately, Sam Crane as Fred Walters is saddled with a rather uninteresting character, used as a lovelorn Cyrano to better contrast with the rest of the Brotherhood, and though Amy Manson certainly looks like a pre-Raphaelite painting, her eyes are a little blank at times (perhaps she was given contacts?)

With cameos from Charles Dickens, William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones (who are mostly caricatures) the series does a colourful job of capturing the world the Brotherhood lived in, from its Victorian staidness to its glamourous underbelly. If there's a single image that captures ""Desperate Romantics"" in its entirety, it would be the boy in their vivid waistcoats and top hats, striding down the street as though the entire world was theirs for the taking.",1478649600,,3662,5.188135593220339

3856362,4,B0026P40NU,"The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were the rock stars of their day -- revolutionary artists who lived scandalous lives when they weren't painting and writing.

And ""Desperate Romantics"" bounces merrily between the Brotherhood's artistic and romantic travails, although taking quite a few liberties (and ending rather abruptly). It eventually turns into a bawdy, sexy soap opera full of love polygons that can only end in death and/or heartbreak... and is mainly hampered by the liberties taken with history.

Journalist Fred Walters (Sam Crane) is mesmerized by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood -- naive prodigy John Everett Millais (Samuel Barnett), fiery and religious William Holman Hunt (Rafe Spall), and the wild sexual Dante Gabriel Rossetti (Aidan Turner). He believes in their dedication to beauty and artistic truth... although unfortunately the stuffy artistic community does not.

So Fred tries to help them. First he finds them a model in Lizzie Siddal (Amy Manson), who immediately attracts every man who knows her. Then he helps them gain the patronage of John Ruskin (Tom Hollander), a famous art critic who gradually warms to Millais and becomes his official sponsor.

But as the Brotherhood become celebrated, their love lives take a turn for the insane. Dante and Lizzie begin a passionate, roller-coaster affair that can only end in tragedy, Hunt falls in love with a bawdy prostitute whom he tries to reform into a lady, and Millais finds himself in a bewildering plot involving Ruskin's wife Effie (who is understandably irritated that her husband has never had sex with her).

""Desperate Romantics"" is (generously) about 75% about the Brotherhood's love lives (especially Rossetti and Lizzie) and maybe 20% about the travails of their art. Of course, there's a lot of overlap -- all three men fall in love with their models, and inspiration seems to be something they can best find in a woman's face.

The entire miniseries is a big explosive mass of passions -- laughing, explosive fights, graphic sex scenes (especially Dante with just about every redhead he meets) and painting with intense abandon. It certainly puts forth that the Pre-Raphaelites were not very nice people sometimes, but watching them explode their way through staid, stuffy Victorian society is delightful. It's sort of like a period soap opera, but with more sex and classic art.

And the actors all seem to be throwing themselves into it -- Turner is particularly enchanting as a wild, charming libertine who constantly chases the forbidden, and loses interest in it when he's gotten it. Barnett and Spall each have their own unique presence, both as the short-fused religious guy and the virginal naf, but Turner is clearly the star here.

Conversely, Crane's mild-mannered journalist is a pretty boring presence, and his attempts to chase after the lady-loves of the Brotherhood become skin-crawlingly embarrassing. And Mason, while she gives a pretty good performance, always sounds like she's in desperate need of a throat lozenge.

So what are the downsides? Well, it deviates from history in some ways -- for instance, William Morris is presented as brilliant but bumbling and clueless. And Lizzie's suicide is presented as ONLY being the result of tension with Rossetti, when in fact she had suffered a devastating stillbirth and depression. Oh, and Rossetti dug up her grave seven years after she died, not a few days later.

""Desperate Romantics"" is a tale of sex, drugs and classically-influenced art -- and while it fiddles with some important details for the sake of drama, it's a fun, explosive miniseries.",1400198400,4,3611,5.210344827586207

It is not in anyway in concordance of the time period of the story and there is a constant underlying confusion between the language the characters speak, and the music which is more similar to a Teletubbies march than anything else. The characters remain shallow.--such as Dickens is completely a caricature, Aidan Turner as Gabriel Rossetti is more similar to a painfully handsome senior highschool production heart throb than a mid 19th century romantic painter, Hunt is barely coherent..., sadly, because my curiosity is now definitely peaked to learn more about these painters whose work I've always admired, but never been able to put into perspective.  But let me get back on the soundtrack: it is possibly the worst ever.(Well, maybe anything by Philip Glass is even more painful).
Excruciatingly handsome Turner is frequently in sexual situations, almost more time is spent without his shirt off than on.

3856384,2,B0026P40NU,"Ok, I know this is a 'fictionalized' account, but this cynical, mocking, shallow account is an insult to preRaphaelites.  It tries to 'frame' them as partying rock stars, or in the case of Hunt, as a dumb hypocrite (yes he had his passions, but beliefs were serious to him). In watching this series you get no clue into their intellectual insights, into their vision and drive. You'd have no clue why they were friends in the first place only that they're all out to lie backstab and cheat each other... Occasionally the writer sticks in some banter about 'new ideas' but we never find out how or why.

You would never know that these guys could quote Dante and Keats at length, how hard they worked, or that, for example, Hunt had deep sincere religious convictions that drove his work. Sorry these guys were not superficial 'rock stars' who appealed to shallow 16 year olds (which describes much of the baby boom generation, even at 60).  Really this boilerplate soap/bodice ripper script could may as well be about a group of young, not so smart bankers or journalists or Postal workers for that matter. They have no gravitas. But what it really is, is a reflection of what the media elite think lies behind human nature-  even with artists that gave us works like PRB, and that is a sad reflection of them, not the PRB artists, and knowing that, its not hard to figure out why the UK is in the state it's in.

The acting and screenplay are awful. Dante seems to do nothing but bed women, kiss his men on the forehead when they do something he likes, and say things like ""That's such a Fred thing to do"" - does this sound like 19th century dialogue or a ""Friends"" Sitcom?

Other commentators have pointed out the historical inaccuracies, I agree and will add to my displeasure of depicting Morris and Burnes Jones as comic nit-wit duo.  The inaccuracies are not mere trivia - the series misses the whole essence of the PRB.

Some other reviewers also noticed the absence of Chritinia Rossetti... all I can say is, thank goodness! Goodness knows what the writers would have portrayed her.

On the upside It's beautifully shot, Zoe Tapper is great as Ruskin's wife, she is one of the few characters who actually seems 'Victorian' and not an MTV video jockey in costume.  Overall, I would say its worth watching if only for the visual appeal and occasional chuckle.

I love the work of the Pre-raphaelites, i hope to see a better depiction soon!",1315958400,11,2445,4.597701149425287
3856385,5,B0026P40NU,"If you are a huge fan of the PRB, you'll find a number of flaws in Desperate Romantics -- enough that I had to summon Coleridge's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" in order to enjoy it -- which I actually did.

Examples:

* The series never addresses Lizzie's pregnancies -- two of them -- that also helped push her to the edge of sanity. Lizzie was pregnant twice in actuality. The fetus died iwhen she was pregnant with the first child, and she was forced -- as often happened in that day -- to carry it to term, go into labor and give birth to a corpse. This took a terrible emotional toll on Lizzie. She was already suffering with Gabriel's incessant affairs, and she felt worthless. When she became pregnant again, and the affairs accelerated, she increased her laudanum intake and died of an overdose. While many believe she committed suicide and it was covered up in order that she would be buried in hallowed ground, I'm of the school that does not discount murder by one of Rossetti's crazed mistresses. Most likely candidate from where I sit would be Fannie Cornforth, who posed for Boca Baciata and who was mad about Gabriel. There are any number of candidates.

* The infamous disinterrment. The film shows Gabriel tossing his poetry in ON TOP of the closed coffin. This is inaccurate. Not only did he bury the poems in the coffin, but the legend grew up that when they disinterred her, her famed red hair had grown to the point that it filled the coffin. The poems were riddled by worms. Fitting, if nothing else.

* The number of paintings for which she posed.  The film downplayed the scores of paintings for which Lizzie posed -- she was Gabriel's primary model. Read Christina Rossetti's poem about Lizzie and her brother -- it was her face that ""looked out"" from every canvas he painted -- even when he painted other models. And while the posthumous painting of Lizzie is his most famous painting of her and is considered his masterpiece by many -- it's far from his only or best painting of Lizzie.

* No mention of Christina. Even though it shows Gabriel's painting of the Annunciation which featured Christina, his sister, it failed to mention her at all even in context of the painting.

* The deplorable depiction of William Morris.  They somehow found it appropriate to turn the founder of the Arts and Crafts movement into little more than a buffoon.

* Minimizing Gabriel's role in the movement.  Rossetti was the primary artist in the movement and the founder of the PRB. He was a most prolific painter, yet Millais and Hunt are shown painting more portraits. I think whoever scripted this series had a bias against  Rossetti. Heaven knows, I have my own bias in that area -- due to his philandering and mistreatment of Lizzie -- but you can't deny the man's genius or belittle him. Look at Proserpine, The Beloved, La Ghirlandata, Astarte Syriaca.

REDEEMING QUALITIES:

The film DID do a fantastic job of its portrayal of Ruskin, of Hunt, who was given over to both his rakish ways AND his extreme religion, of Ruskin's poor virgin wife. And its portrayal of Millais is sheer genius, I felt. He was depicted precisely as I've envisioned.

Another greatly redeeming quality is its portrayal of the PRB as they were - wild young men barely out of their teens with these preposterous dreams of being the next great movement in art -- something they dreamed and then made come to pass with all the dynamic energy and bravado of their youth. They erupted through a staid and boring period of art to create a veritable volcano of human emotion and humanism -- whether you're looking at Boca Baciata or Ophelia or Millais' Blind Girl or even Hunt's Scapegoat.

I loved seeing them with their hats on lopsided, swaggering through the cobblestone streets, demanding to be seen.

So that was wonderful enough that I know I'll watch the series again. All that said, I still wait impatiently for the day when a film about the incredible story of the PRB will be made with a measure of accuracy. The truth was far more dramatic than the watered down version this became.",1309824000,47,4086,4.64632454923717

8353357,5,B0026P40NU,"Three painters and 1 writer, naming themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, didn't exactly burst on the London art scene; they sort of bullied their way in. They challenged the academicians of the London Royal Academy, introducing or reintroducing, a medieval style, mixed with some Italian 15th century influences. They actually, by and large, were not great artists. There is one glorious painting by Rossetti, titled Bocca Baciata (Lips That Have Been Kissed) in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.  Its story is in the film.  Rossetti did become an outstanding poet. This cohort had a definite penchant for redheaded models with thick wavy hair and plump lips.  Moderately loyal to their brothers (when they werent, their confessions were immediate), they generally advised each other, critiqued each others work, and one, in particular, Rossetti (the fiery Aidan Turner of Poldark), provided special guidance in sexual Congress (it seems I cant prevent the capital C).  Whether historically precise or not, this 6-part miniseries is successful in every regard  writing (fleshing out characters and producing such a clever script), directing, casting, acting, music, cinematography, editing, costumes (amazing), art, design, and on and on.
