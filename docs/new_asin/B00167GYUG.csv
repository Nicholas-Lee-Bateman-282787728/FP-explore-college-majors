8261283,1,B00167GYUG,"As with all attempts to reenact the single bullet theory, certain little ""details"" have to be fudged to make it appear convincing for the uninformed TV viewer. Entrance wounds need to be moved (many people are unaware that the medical panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations in the 1970s moved the wound in JFK's ""neck"" down to its proper place in his upper back); angles need to be changed; the bodies of JFK and Connally have to be arranged in ways that do not fit the photographs from Dealey Plaza (depicting JFK leaning forward, when he was actually sitting up straight), or showing the bullet entering the wrong side of Connally's wrist, as NOVA did.

One of the most prominent errors in this program's reenactment (using two headless torsos) is that the profile shot of the bullet's path made it clear the bullet exited from the Kennedy torso's chest, and not its throat. They do correctly show the bullet entering JFK's back, not the neck, but the result is exactly what critics have always noted: the bullet would exit from JFK's chest.

8261285,5,B00167GYUG,"The cable television network ""The Discovery Channel"" aired the documentary program ""Unsolved History: JFK -- Beyond The Magic Bullet"" in November 2004, a very impressive John F. Kennedy assassination-related program which set out to attempt to duplicate (with all possible accuracy) the controversial ""Single-Bullet Theory"" [SBT]; and it's a program which hammered one or two more nails into the ""conspiracy"" coffin.

The more and more time that passes, the firmer and more solidified the ""Lone Assassin"" position becomes with respect to JFK's murder in Dallas on November 22, 1963; while the ""It Was A Conspiracy"" side makes no headway whatsoever, with zero tests like that of The Discovery Channel's ""SBT"" test coming from the ""conspiracy"" side of the table, in order to buttress their continued beliefs that a multi-gun conspiracy was responsible for ending the life of John Kennedy in Dealey Plaza.

Several impressive things supporting the overall doability and viability of the SBT scenario came out of the ""Beyond The Magic Bullet"" program, such as the ""log"" test, which has a Western Cartridge Company [WCC] rifle bullet -- just exactly like the whole bullet that is in evidence in the JFK case (Warren Commission Exhibit No. 399, commonly known as ""CE399"") -- being fired into a solid tree log.

The test bullet penetrated more than halfway through the lengthy log and came out looking absolutely perfect after being dug out of several feet of solid wood. That Mannlicher-Carcano [MC] test bullet, in fact, could have been an identical twin for CE399, right down to the slight oozing of metal (lead) from the base of the missile, just like CE399's ""oozing of lead"" configuration.

That ""log"" test tends to illustrate just how tough the Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition is. It is a fully-jacketed bullet that is designed to do a lot of damage to the things it hits without substantially breaking up or deforming the bullet itself.

However, the MC/WCC ammunition, while very rugged, does have its limitations too, as proven by the Warren Commission's tests in 1964 and by tests done in the 1970s by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kennedy-And-Lincoln/dp/0151522812/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Kennedy And Lincoln""</a>&nbsp;author Dr. John Lattimer.

The respective bullet tests performed by the Warren Commission and in later years by Dr. Lattimer involved firing various MC/WCC bullets directly into human skulls. After striking the skulls at full muzzle velocity, each of these test bullets significantly deformed and fragmented into multiple pieces....just exactly as was the case when Lee Harvey Oswald's third bullet (fired from his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle on 11/22/63) struck President Kennedy in the back of the head, killing the President.

The ""Beyond The Magic Bullet"" SBT re-creation itself proves beyond any doubt that a WCC, 6.5-millimeter, full-metal-jacketed, Mannlicher-Carcano bullet exactly like CE399 could, indeed, take a very similar path through two ""bodies"", and then emerge in pretty decent shape.

The Discovery Channel test bullet was more damaged than CE399, that's true, but IMO the test proved a very important thing -- it proved that a bullet like Oswald's CE399 could go through two (mock) bodies, do a lot of damage, and NOT BE BROKEN UP AT ALL at the end of such a test.

The test bullet, just like 399, emerged PERFECTLY WHOLE (i.e., not fragmented at all). It's all in ONE PIECE. It's flattened more than 399, yes....but certainly not banged all to hell like noted conspiracy advocate Dr. Cyril Wecht seems to think a bullet like 399 would HAVE to have been if it went through the bodies of both John F. Kennedy and John Connally and caused seven wounds.

Plus, there's the fact that the Discovery Channel's test bullet caused an extra (second) rib fracture within the John Connally mock-up ""body"" during the re-creation as well. (Which was no doubt due to the fact that the gunman performing the re-creation missed the target on JFK's upper back just slightly, hitting the Kennedy mock torso a little to the left and below the target representing the actual back wound of President Kennedy.)

But even so, the simulated bullet still wasn't nearly as deformed as most conspiracy-happy theorists seem to feel CE399 HAD to be after causing seven wounds in two men. The Connally back wound during the test was also ""elongated"" (keyhole-shaped) in nature, just exactly like the real Connally's back injury in 1963.

The SBT has been proven to be a likely possibility given the known wound locations of the two victims in the Presidential limousine. Because, after seeing such relatively-successful tests like this one in the ""Beyond The Magic Bullet"" program, we would have to believe the even more unlikely scenario (if the SBT is not how the shooting occurred) that includes a separate bullet striking Governor Connally's back at precisely the same spot where a possible ""SBT"" shot would also have struck him. And what are the odds of that occurring?

Also -- The nose portion of the ""BtMB"" test bullet wasn't flattened at all either, which is an important factor, indicating almost certainly that it took a similar path through John Connally's ""mock"" torso in the test, just as CE399 very likely took through Connally's real torso in Dallas in '63 -- indicating a bullet that smashed into most of the hard objects that it hit in a BACKWARD, END-FIRST manner, thereby keeping the nose undamaged.

And another impressive part of the ""Magic Bullet"" broadcast was the ending sequence which had a doctor giving his erroneous opinion that the damage he had just seen in the X-rays from the re-creation almost certainly must have been caused ""by more than just one bullet"".

When proven wrong in this multi-bullet belief, the Los Angeles doctor was genuinely surprised. (I wonder if conspiracy believers think that he was a ""plant"" of some kind, and that he only feigned a surprised reaction when confronted with the test results to further the notion of the SBT?)

Another point I'd like to make regarding the ""Beyond The Magic Bullet"" re-creation (with respect to John Connally's thigh wound) --- Many conspiracy theorists like to point out (with a certain amount of glee) that the ""test"" bullet in the Discovery Channel re-creation/simulation didn't penetrate the surrogate thigh wound of John B. Connally. Instead, the test bullet struck the simulated thigh and then immediately bounced off into the grass.

But it's very, very possible that a similar occurrence DID happen with the real Governor Connally in 1963. That is to say:

It's quite possible (given the nearly-""spent"" condition of Bullet CE399 at the time it struck Connally's leg) that the bullet did not remain in his thigh for any length of time at all. Perhaps it immediately came out of that shallow leg wound and then simply fell down into Connally's pants leg....where it remained until later falling out of the clothing onto his stretcher inside Parkland Hospital.

But the main point I want to make about the ""bouncing off the thigh"" test bullet vs. the real bullet that struck Connally on November 22nd is.....

If CE399 did, in fact, pop out of the Governor's thigh just after entering his leg, it would have had virtually NO CHOICE but to remain in Connally's pants leg (unless some conspiracist now wants to theorize that the bullet miraculously exited Connally's leg by way of the very same small hole in his pants where it entered).

Sure, the bullet could have conceivably found its way down to the bottom of his pants-leg opening and dropped out into the car immediately. But a reasonable person researching the case knows that that scenario did not happen....because if it had occurred, a bullet would have been found in the car that could equate to Connally's wounds.

In my opinion, it's very likely that that bullet (CE399) almost immediately fell out of Connally's leg after striking the thigh, and it remained in his pants leg until after he was wheeled into the hospital.

Such a scenario would also (in a small way at the very least) explain why there was no trace evidence left on Bullet CE399, due to the fact that it was never ""buried"" in a victim for any length of time whatsoever, thereby making it less likely for trace evidence to have accumulated on the missile.

All-in-all....the Discovery Channel broadcast did an amazing job at replicating the damage path and general characteristics of CE399. The test bullet exited the JFK mock body much lower than the real 399 did in '63, true. I certainly cannot deny this obvious difference. But we must keep in mind that a PERFECT re-creation of the SBT can never be fully achieved, with every single ""human"" nuance accounted for (since only mock torsos were utilized in the re-creation).

With some unavoidable limitations in mind, the SBT re-creation done by the Australian team of JFK researchers in early October of 2004 is as close to the real event that I believe we're likely to ever see. And the results most certainly do not debunk the likelihood of the Single-Bullet Conclusion. To the contrary -- the results of that re-creation enhance the viability of the Warren Commission's one-bullet conclusion greatly.

=========================

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

Prominent JFK assassination researchers Vincent Bugliosi and Dale Myers both put in appearances during the ""Magic Bullet"" program, providing insight and commmentary.

Mr. Myers won an Emmy Award for his excellent computer animation work that he presented in the 2003 ABC-TV documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kennedy-Assassination-Beyond-Conspiracy/dp/B0001BFDKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy""</a>, which is animation work that demonstrates the validity of the Single-Bullet Theory, providing further proof (via technology that wasn't available in previous years) that the SBT is far from being the incredible and ""impossible"" feat that most conspiracists want to imagine it is.

""It's a straight line....it's the only way it COULD have happened."" -- Dale K. Myers; 2004

Mr. Bugliosi was involved in one of the most riveting JFK-related events of all time -- that being the 1986 television mock trial,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Trial-Lee-Harvey-Oswald/dp/B001CDLASU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald""</a>. Bugliosi, as prosecuting attorney, squared off in the simulated courtroom trial against Oswald defense counsel Gerry Spence. The 21-hour trial, held in London, had a real judge and twelve sworn jurors, plus real witnesses in the Kennedy murder case. Bugliosi was able to secure a ""Guilty"" verdict against Oswald at the end of that TV ""Docu-Trial"".

That exposure to the JFK case in 1986 prompted Bugliosi to spend the next 20 years writing a massive book on the case,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reclaiming-History-The-Assassination-Of-President-John-F-Kennedy/dp/0393045250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Reclaiming History: The Assassination Of President John F. Kennedy""</a>, which was published in 2007.

Bugliosi provides a few tidbits of general information throughout the early stages of this ""Magic Bullet"" program. I would have enjoyed hearing a lot more from Vince and Dale throughout this documentary, but their on-screen time is not very prolonged, but it's intriguing nonetheless.

Here are a couple of comments made by Bugliosi during this ""Beyond The Magic Bullet"" program:

""The American people are simply misinformed. They think they know what happened; but there's an enormous amount of material in this case they have no idea about."" -- VB

~~~~~

""If, in fact, the bullet that passed through Kennedy did NOT go on and hit Connally, then the bullet that DID hit Connally, by definition, would have had to have been a separate bullet from a second gunman. Why? Because Kennedy and Connally were hit virtually at the same time. And with Oswald's single-shot, bolt-action rifle, it would have been absolutely impossible for him to squeeze off two rounds within a split-second of each other."" -- VB

~~~~~

That last Vince Bugliosi quote above goes a long way, in my opinion, toward debunking the ""Anti-SBT/Pro-Lone Gunman"" theory put forth by Mark Fuhrman in his 2006 book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Simple-Act-Of-Murder/dp/0060721545/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""A Simple Act Of Murder""</a>, which is a theory of Mr. Fuhrman's that DOES indeed have Oswald performing a non-SBT solo act and doing what Vince has said (via the above quote) is ""absolutely impossible"".

I agree 100% with Bugliosi -- it was ""absolutely impossible"" for Lee Harvey Oswald to wound JFK and John Connally with separate bullets, given the Zapruder Film timeline of the event.

The Single-Bullet Theory is still fully intact....and always will be in my opinion. It's the ""best evidence"" in the case for what actually happened to President Kennedy and Governor Connally on Friday afternoon, November 22, 1963.
