8149232,5,B000J4OYOA,"George Burns -- a comedy master.  Like fine wine, he just got better with age.  Funny without vulgarity; still can't sing worth a damn, but who cared?  An icon of the golden age of comedy.  He's been gone almost 20 years; and I still miss his wit.",1447804800,,247,4.191489361702128
8149233,5,B000J4OYOA,"This is typical george....walks a little more stilted,,,doesn't have gracie, excepting for the wig, same old george.. If you remember him or are the newbies wanting to see how it was done by a master you will love it.. He was not much of a singer although he always wanted to sing... Had great timing, great stage presence...Don't know anyone who comes close today.",1388361600,3,365,4.71875
