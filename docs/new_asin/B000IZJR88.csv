8308870,5,B000IZJR88,"In this action-filled drama, Sunny Deol plays Karan, a hired gun for the local crime lord.  When planning to beat up Kajal's father, he sees her and instantly falls in love with her.  Kajal ( Karisma Kapoor) hates Karan at first, but gradually falls in love with him as well.  Her father, not knowing her secret, arranges a marriage for KajAL with Raju (Salman Khan), a family friend.  When Raju crosses the same crime lord, Karan is hired to kill Raju and the unexpected happens.

This film is engrossing, sometimes moving, and always entertaining.  It is quite violent, not atypical for Bollywood, and contains some impressive musical numbers.  Deol is fantastic in his role, and is especially chilling as a killer.  Khan was a bit over-the-top in his interpretation of Raju, but was as charming as ever.  Kapoor played her emotional scenes spectacularly well.

Overall, this is an excellent film and well worth watching for Bollywood fans.",1490918400,,942,4.942675159235669
8308871,4,B000IZJR88,"Before you consider watching this movie, there are some things you have to accept at the outset.  1) A man will fall in love with a woman at first sight; 2) a woman will fall in love very quickly with a man who formerly attacked her; 3) the same woman will fall in love very quickly with a completely different man; 4) love has the power to reform a criminal; and 5) all will be sacrificed in the name of love.  If you can accept these things (at least for the duration of three hours), then watch on.

Karan (Sunny Deol) is a hoodlum who breaks bones at the command of his gangster boss. Kajal (Karisma Kapoor) is the daughter of an unassuming man who once got in the way of Karan. When Karan first lays eyes on Kajal, he falls instantly in love and decides to reform his life. Kajal eventually (well, quickly) falls in love with him also, but she is married off suddenly to Raju (Salman Khan), the man of her father's choosing. She devotes herself completely to Raju for the sake of her father, but she ends up falling in love with him, despite her former love for Karan. Circumstances come to a head at the end of the film, when Karan, Raju, and Kajal must fight the bad guys and much will be sacrificed for the sake of love.  Who gets to be with Kajal? Watch the movie and find out.

The style of the film is very dated, but I love it in the way that you love a cult classic. It should also be said that I love it because a) I think Sunny Deol is a lovable tough guy; 2) I think Salman Khan is pure superstar; and 3) I think Karisma Kapoor is one of the most unique, charming, and adorable actresses to grace Hindi cinema of the 1990s. If you also feel this way about these actors, then you'll probably like the movie, too. Special mention goes to Tabu, who plays the prostitute with the heart of gold - she has a wonderful dance number.

There are some memorable songs here - I particularly like ""Yaara O Yaara"" between Sunny and Karisma.  The choreography for this song has been referred to as the ant-stomping dance because...well, watch it for yourself and you'll see why.  Even if it's not the most elegant choreography ever devised, I still find it utterly charming.  On the other hand, Karisma is given some very solid choreography in her opening dance number.

Bottom line: Sunny + Salman + Karisma = goodness all around.",1303603200,2,2333,4.3180778032036615
