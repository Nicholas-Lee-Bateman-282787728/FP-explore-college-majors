5785215,3,B00D9EJFTQ,"Love the movie Count of Monte Cristo, which was the only reason for getting this dvd. Why the movie Man Friday needed to be included is a mystery! It is a DREADFUL film!",1422057600,,169,4.151515151515151
5785216,5,B00D9EJFTQ,very nice copy.,1414713600,,15,4.333333333333333
5785217,3,B00D9EJFTQ,"If I have to rate the purchase, delivery, and packing, I definitely would go with 4 stars. The reason I am placing 3 stars is because of the not good selection to combine the two movies in one disc. Count of Monte Cristo is a high level classical movie with excellent performance of Richard Chamberlain, while the second movie is less then OK. In terms of the quality of the item - excellent.",1413072000,,392,4.383561643835616
5785218,5,B00D9EJFTQ,"The Count of Monte Cristo with Richard Chamberlain is a well established classic and does not need me to praise it. It has an all star cast and the acting is superb! I owned a previous release on DVD and the picture quality was so bad as to render the movie unviewable. This release on Blu-ray is perfect so, if you are a collector like myself, this is the one to have in your movie collection.",1409097600,8,394,4.197368421052632
5785219,5,B00D9EJFTQ,I was so glad to finally get the Count of Monte Cristo on DVD. This version is one of my favorites as it follows the book better the the newer version I'm not crazy about Man Friday but I purchased this copy solely for the Monte Cristo DVD as the price was excellent.,1408579200,2,267,4.056603773584905
5785220,5,B00D9EJFTQ,Count of Monte Cristo was excellent and looked great on blu ray....I have not watched Man Friday yet.  But the price was well worth it for Monte Cristo.  Product was as described and arrived intact.,1408147200,,198,4.628571428571429
5785221,5,B00D9EJFTQ,"Whether or not you agree with how authentic the story telling is, it is quantum leaps better than the VHS tape on playback",1396742400,2,122,4.3478260869565215
5785222,5,B00D9EJFTQ,The Count of Monte Cristo is well worth the Blu-ray purchase. Man Friday won't be seen again by members in our home.,1387238400,4,116,4.318181818181818
5785223,3,B00D9EJFTQ,Count of Monte Cristo was great.  Man Friday was pretty bad!!!  For the price one of the two being good is worth it.,1383609600,4,116,4.0
5785244,5,B00D9EJFTQ,This version of Count of Mote Cristo is the one to have. The cast is perfect for each part starting with Richard Chamberlain as Edmond.,1473465600,,135,4.44

5785247,5,B00D9EJFTQ,"As I commented in a review of another movie you simply cannot crowd a book that lasts for hundreds of page into a short movie like this BUT even though Richard Chamberlain's physical appearance does not resemble the dark-haired brooding hero as described by Dumas he certainly captures the spirit of the book.  The plot has been altered in the extreme but it is a great swashbuckler.  Chamberlain is the best Edmond Dantes I have seen among the various cinematic offerings.  No one handles a cape as elegantly as this author and his acting captured the anguish of being arrested unjustly on the eve of his marriage and his imprisonment without trial.  And anyone who has ever seen this movie will never forget Chamberlain's exuberant, ""The World Is MINE!!!!""  Sadly that line does not happen in the book but that's OK.  This is a really good movie of revenge that captures the spirit if not the details of the book.  And anyone who thinks revenge is not satisfying has not read the book or seen any of the movies.",1462320000,2,1013,4.625698324022347
5785248,5,B00D9EJFTQ,"I have the VHS of The Count of Monte Cristo. I love it. Richard Chamberlain is fantastic. I bought this DVD, because it was the only way I could get it. It's a classic and I wouldn't have a movie collection without it.
It takes place in France just after Napoleon. It's about a man who wants revenge on three men who have ruined his life and he has landed in prison on an island. The movie is about how he gets even.",1433980800,2,416,4.024096385542169

5785251,5,B00D9EJFTQ,WHAT A BARGAIN;TWO GREAT MOVIES!,1424217600,,32,5.6
5785252,4,B00D9EJFTQ,"I'm saying that I give this twin pack of movies 4 stars but that is for the count of monte cristo. The man Friday movie, I really didn't like, terribly dull. so I am excluding that from this review. Still a good price for 2 movies. As for The Count of Monte Cristo...classic tale of revenge written by Alexandre Dumas. 4 men collaborate to have Edmund dantes put in prison for 15 years for reasons each has for hating him. He escapes and finds a treasure and let the games begin, he sets about destroying each one in turn. Terrific story. The actors go way over the top sometimes especially Richard Chamberlain but it works. Just sit back and enjoy the intricacies of the movie and overlook a lot of the bad acting. Tony Curtis and his Bronx accent cracks me up.",1423612800,2,762,4.373239436619718
5785253,4,B00D9EJFTQ,"I purchased this for ""The Count"" but ""Man Friday"" is an interesting film too.  Richard Chamberlain's version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is one of the most accurate to the novel that I've seen, and he does a fine job as always, but I didn't love this like I do the Jim Caviezel version (which is, admittedly, less true to the book, but oddly better for its optimistic departures).  The Chamberlain ""Count"" is pretty melancholy -- it looks and feels like the 1970s costume picture it is.  If you love Dumas and like Chamberlain you should be pleased with this film, as I am.

""Man Friday"" is a politically-correct, noble-savage version of ""Robinson Crusoe"".  Richard Roundtree is an excellent Friday, and Peter O'Toole is lots of fun as Crusoe, but these are not the Friday and Crusoe of Daniel Defoe's novel.  Rather, this is Crusoe as bigoted white man buffoon and Friday as wise and patient native.  I really enjoyed the acting of the leads, and the very funny scenes they have together, but the whole thing left me feeling rather icky.

At $15, this was a good deal to get two films on both blu-ray and DVD, but I'm sure I'll only watch ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" again.  Once was enough for me and ""Man Friday"".",1422662400,7,1219,4.529680365296803

8590977,4,B00D9EJFTQ,"The Count of Monte Cristo was a great movie!  Sadly, Man Friday was a musical!  Terrible!  This Bluray disc was a bit pricey, so I didn't expect the second movie to be so bad!",1514332800,,175,4.088235294117647

8590979,4,B00D9EJFTQ,"A really good version of the story. I was disappointed that subtitles were not available. As a hard-0f-hearing person, subtitles would have made the movie much more enjoyable.",1508025600,,175,5.285714285714286

8590981,4,B00D9EJFTQ,I'm a Richard Chamberlain fan so anything he stars in I thoroughly enjoy.  I've had this film on VCR for many years and gave up hoping it would come out on a DVD.  What an extra treat to get this movie on Blu ray.,1484265600,,213,3.8181818181818183

8590984,4,B00D9EJFTQ,"I liked Count of Monte Cristo.  I would rent it rather than buy it, though.",1478390400,,75,4.0
8590985,5,B00D9EJFTQ,I have been looking for Chamberlain's portrayal of the Count on disc since I only had a VHS tape.  His is the best version of the Count to date though it does not follow the book itself.  I think it is better than Caviezel's portrayal..  Thanks to another reviewer I picked up this 2 disc version instead of the Korean one I was going to buy and will simply throw away the Man Friday.,1474761600,,384,4.162162162162162
