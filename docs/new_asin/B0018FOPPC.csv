8269724,1,B0018FOPPC,"FIRST OFF LET ME SAY THAT THE INSTRUCTOR IS GREAT! HIS EXAMPLE OF HOW KNIFE GRIP IS NOT IMPORTANT WAS GREAT! THE REASON I GAVE IT SUCH A LOW SCORE IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE USEFUL HERE AND BECAUSE NOBODY IS GOING TO ATTACK A BIG STRONG MAN IN A MUSCLE SHIRT AND FATIGUES HOLDING A COMBAT FOLDER KNIFE! THIS DVD SHOWS THE INSTRUCTOR SLAPING AROUND A YOUNG SKINNY KID ABOUT 17 TO 19 YRS. OLD AROUND FOR AN HOUR(NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE STYLE). THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR A DVD LIKE THIS TO EXIST. IN THE END THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS DVD WAS ""I CAN KILL YOU IF DO NOT HAVE A KNIFE AND I DO"". I KNEW THAT ALREADY! THANK YOU CAPTAIN OBVIOUS FOR THE INCREDIBLE ENLIGHTENMENT!",1261267200,2,676,4.207692307692308
