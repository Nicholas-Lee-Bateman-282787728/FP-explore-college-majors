8267199,4,B0017SZ9FA,"We purchased this DVD almost 2 years ago, and my son stills like to watch it every now and then.  He finds Dot, Arch and Dee to be absolutely cute!  The graphics on the DVD are very basic, they appear as to be made out of construction paper and crayon, which catches the imagination of little ones.  Imagine being spoken to (and taught) by familiar figures that you could've built yourself?

Most bad reviews about this DVD have to do with the fact that children might not find this DVD interesting.  As an experienced parent of children who have taken music lessons; you will not get your child interested on something like this unless you take part of it.  If your child is too young to understand (3 and 4 year olds will not be interested in this); try again in a few months.

The DVD teaches notes of the staff (Treble clef), one piano octave and about certain musical terms: Piano (soft), Forte (strong), Allegro (fast), Adagio (slow).  It would've been perfect if they had continued the series with more advanced DVDs.

Overall not the best in the market, but perhaps good enough for the money.

Note: I recommend this DVD over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suzie-s-Piano-Primer-Piano-Lessons-for-Kids/dp/B002UXRE6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suzie's Piano Primer - Piano Lessons for Kids!</a>, or at the very least, maybe you should get both to help cover a wider range or perhaps alternate depending on your child's interests.  Please read my review for that one!",1423267200,2,1516,5.172131147540983
8267200,3,B0017SZ9FA,"This video was done by the same people who did Suzie's Piano Primer.  It's obvious that this one was the first one.  It's twice as long (an hour), it covers more topics, but the execution is boring.  My toddler, who loves Suzie's Piano Primer, couldn't make it through this video, so we will definitely have to watch it in segments.  This video covers notes on the treble clef staff and on the piano (which is all Suzie's Piano Primer covers), how to count the whole, half, and quarter notes, and fingering.  I'm not even sure what the little characters are supposed to be or what relation their names have to piano, but they are not entertaining.  Suzie's Piano Primer is really cute and entertaining, but it doesn't cover anything besides the keys on the piano and treble cleff staff.",1398211200,,786,4.618705035971223
8267201,3,B0017SZ9FA,"There were no reviews when I bought the DVD, so I took a chance.  I am using it now with my 7 yr olds, as an addition to our beginning home piano lessons-- just as they are moving from playing quarter notes by fingering to reading notes on the staff.

The DVD offers cute ways to learn keys,notes,basic counting,some musical terms and some simple songs.

There are printable handouts:
4 Worksheets: Match The Keys,Match The Staff,Match the Musical Terms(only 4: adagio, piano allegro, forte),Match the Staff Elements;
4 Songs, all treble clef: Go To Sleep (simple middle c-f scale) Learn The Staff Song(based on C major &F major),Tiptoe Like a Spider and The Silly Song)

There is also a Treble Clef game that is nice for practice in identifying treble clef notes(which is free on the Brain Melody website).

However....it only focuses on treble clef. The animation is very basic: hand drawn figures with rudimentary movement. The pacing on basic information and segues between scenes is slow and on areas where practice may be needed, it does not offer a pause. In addition, I wish there were an accompanying ""teacher's guide"" that indicated which handouts to use with each scene and when to pause the DVD for students to practice. The teacher's guide could also include the keys to the worksheets instead of placing them on the worksheets. Also, it would be nice to have a Bass clef game as well.

All in all, if the DVD were about half the price or there were more material, I would consider it a better value.",1360454400,,1513,4.712121212121212
8267202,1,B0017SZ9FA,"Although, it covers basic piano (keys, finger count, notes, etc.), it is unable to hold our 4yr old's attention past the 2nd lesson; moves too slow for kids. Save your money, buy something else, or as someone suggested in an earlier review borrow it from the library.",1299024000,,267,4.702127659574468
8267203,2,B0017SZ9FA,"I used this product with my 6 year old.  While it slightly kept her attention, there is very little playing along time.  Disappointed for the price.",1296345600,,148,4.653846153846154
8267204,4,B0017SZ9FA,This DVD would be suitable for very young children who know little to nothing about the piano.  I was disappointed that it did not include information on the Bass Clef notes.  My kids enjoy it.,1270771200,5,193,4.485714285714286
8267205,2,B0017SZ9FA,"This DVD is useful for a child just starting and who knows nothing about piano.  It moves along very slowly, which is good for children (though boring for parents -- lol). It is not very entertaining, but progresses in a logical and easy to follow sequence.  A good library borrow as I can't imagine a child watching this again and again.",1235433600,6,338,4.524590163934426
8267206,5,B0017SZ9FA,I bought this for my daughter who just turned 4 years old. Its an amazing video that teaches children (or adults) about the the piano in a fun way. It also teaches musical terms and how to read music. I highly recommend it.,1231372800,3,223,4.209302325581396
8267207,5,B0017SZ9FA,It was very complete.  Covered many concepts and explained the piano on a kid-friendly level.  Kids enjoy watching it. It explains things very well.  I highly recommend it.,1209340800,9,172,5.071428571428571
