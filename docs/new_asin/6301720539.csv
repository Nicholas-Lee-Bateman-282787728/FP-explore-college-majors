348854,5,6301720539,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in terms of cinematography. Hong Kong was colorful and facinating, a world that doesn't exist 60 years later. I would gladly trade my old VHS for a fresh remastered DVD. The plot has been covered several times so I'd just like to mention a few individual scenes that stand out. Susan and Clark standing on the balcony with the wind whipping at them watching the typhoon blow in across the harbor. The old bartender and aging harlot marrying in the bar because ""its not good to be alone when you're old"" Hundreds of sampans sailing to the rescue like the US Cavalry.

She finally turns to Hank Lee to help her rescue her husband.

349254,4,6301720539,"""Soldier of Fortune"" is a 1955 Cinemascope and Deluxe color exotic adventure yarn about a woman trying to unravel the mystery of her husband's disappearance in China. It was the first and only pairing of Hollywood superstars Clark Gable and Susan Hayward.

In the mid 50s film makers were trying to stem the tide of TV and cinemascope and exotic locations were all the rage - ""Macao"" (1952), ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" (1955), ""The Left Hand of God"" (1955), etc.

Clark Gable (1901-60) plays an opportunist businessman in Hong Kong. Gable was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. We remember him best as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the others - 1935's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and 1934s ""It Happened One Night""). My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958).

FWIW - This was Gable's first film as an independent after leaving his long time MGM contract. He received 10% of the gross and a guarantee of $400,000. At first he was reluctant to make the film because he thought he was too old, but he liked the anti-communist message.

Beautiful Susan Hayward (1917-75) plays the wife of an American photographer who is missing in China. She was a major star in the 40s and 50s, earning 5 Oscar nominations and 1 win (""I Want to Live""). She won Best Actress at Cannes for ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" (1955) and won a Golden Globe for ""With a Song in My Heart"" (1952).

FWIW - Hayward was in a custody battle in LA and couldn't leave the country, so all her scenes are shot in LA.

Michael Rennie (1909-71) had an active film career in England and then because of his unique physical appearance and voice was tapped by Robert Wise to play Klaatu in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951). He went on make dozens of films and was active on TV as Harry Lime in ""The Third Man"" (1959-65). Rennie does his usual stoic job here as a British officer who reluctantly helps Gable rescue Hayward's husband.

Handsome and suave Gene Barry (1919-2009) plays Hayward's husband. We remember him best from the TV series ""Bat Masterson"" (1958-61) and his Golden Globe winning ""Burke's Law"" (1963-5), and from his leading role in ""War of the Worlds"" (1953).

Look for veteran character actors Tom Tully (1908-82) as the owner of a bar, hulky Leo Gordon (1922-2000) as his helper, and Richard Loo (1903-83) as a former General who helps Hayward.

Tully made more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954). He transitioned to TV in the 50s and appeared as a regular on ""The Lineup"" (1954-9), ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" (1964-6) and ""Shane"" (1966).Leo Gordon made a career playing heavies in more than 100 films and also on TV. He's best known for playing Crazy Mike Carnie in ""Riot in Cell Block 11"" (1954), and Gordon, in fact, had served time in San Quentin where this movie was filmed. Don Siegel, the film's director, called Gordon ""the scariest man I ever met.""

Loo was Master Sun (the Weapons Master) in the TV series ""Kung Fu"". Between 1942 and 1981 Loo appeared in more than 100 films.

Director Edward Dmytryk (1908-1999) was part of the Hollywood 10, a group of blacklisted film makers imprisoned during the McCarthy era. Dmytryk was nominated for an Oscar for ""Crossfire"" (1947) and won at Cannes. He was twice nominated for a DGA award - ""the Young Lions"" (1958) and ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954). Among the 50+ films he directed were ""The Left Hand of God"" (1955), and ""The Carpetbaggers"" (1964).

The photography is from Leo Tover (1902-64). Tover was twice nominated for an Oscar (""The Heiress"", ""Hold Back the Dawn"") but I think his best work was on ""The Snake Pit"" (1948), ""The Sun Also Rises"" (1957), and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951).

The NY Times called the story ""a glib and implausible fiction that would be embarrassing to a grade-B film"", but did praise the photography as ""pretty"" and the minor characters as ""amusing"". Variety was kinder. They called it a ""well-balanced show"", said Rennie was ""extremely able and likeable"" and called the photography ""standout"". They concluded that ""Clark Gable and Susan Hayward team advantageously.""

In 1955  ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister  Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"" were the top 5. The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""The 7 Year Itch"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Oklahoma"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Virgin Queen"".

Bottom line - the story is silly but the photography is beautiful, the setting is exotic, and it's the only chance you'll get to see Gable and Hayward together.",1344124800,3,4794,4.742788461538462
349255,5,6301720539,"Holds your attention from beginning to end...you don't want it to
end.  The scenic country is amazing and adds even more to this
high adventure film!!!!!",1335052800,,153,4.884615384615385
349256,5,6301720539,"Soldier of Fortune was the epitome of the Technicolor Cinemascope adventure films of the 1950's and no one did them better than 20th Century Fox.  Soldier of Fortune was adopted from an Ernest K. Gann novel (he also wrote ""The High and the Mighty"") and is a classic and rousing old fashioned adventure movie.  During the 1950's, Fox shot a lot of on location films in the far east (such as ""Love is a Many Spendored Thing"") and the authenticity shows through (although the scenes with Susan Hayward were shot back in Hollywood because she was expecting and did not want to travel overseas).  But Clark Gable carries this film and shows why he was the ""king"" of Hollywood for almost 30 years.  This feature also stars Gene Barry and you'll see many familiar faces in the various character actors filling important roles (Michael Rennie, Tom Tully, Russell Collins, Alex D'Arcy, etc).

The film has been beautifully restored  and is shown in a wide screen aspect ratio of 2.55:1 as originally presented in 1955.  Beautifully photographed by Leo Tovar and competently directed by Edward Dmytryk.  Hugo Friedhofer composed the sound track music and was very experienced in far eastern sounding music.

A treaured addition to any film library.",1321747200,,1238,4.913461538461538
349306,5,6301720539,"One of the most under-rated adventure movies, masterfully done in CinemaScope in a wonderful transfer. This exceptional yarn, ably written by its author, Ernest K. Gann, delivers high romance, comedy (and, yes, early 50's racism) along with dosages of chauvinism and gallantry embodied in its protagonist, Clark Gable. This 1954 picture has an experienced supporting cast, including Richard Loo and Gene Barry and the lovely Susan Hayward, as the independent, steely lady. The story however, that others may more completely tell, has stayed with me since my youth because Clark Gable (as Hank Lee) happened to have a 20mm cannon below decks in his personal sailing junk to complete his wealhy trappings. What is so remarkable about this location-shot film is that the director had to shoot all the Hayward scenes stateside during her personal divorce. And you do not notice it here, with the most flattering, seamless process shots that out-do those of Hitchcock in ""To Catch A Thief."" Second to the loveliness of Hayward are the superb sweeping Hong Kong shots as you follow her in search of her missing husband(Barry) and Hank Lee(Gable) driven in his Rolls Royce. Two people who meet by coincidence with a mutual goal hold off their most secret longings until the near-impossible occurs. That about sums up a lot of 1950's steamy romantic films but that is just the start of this one. At just over an hour and a half, ""Soldier Of Fortune"" surprisingly delivers the kind of adventure and suspense done in twice the time by today's 'auteurs.' The pacing, the colorful old-world-weary hangers-on in ""Tweedies"", a local bar and habitue of down-on-their luckers, add measurably to the authentic feel of post-war Hong Kong depicted so ably by the director, Edward Dmytryk.",1320624000,,1769,5.061643835616438

* Special footnote: -- actor Clark Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in ""Dance, Fools, Dance"" (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in ""A Free Soul"" (1931) the same year. ""The Painted Desert"" (1931).  His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in ""Red Dust"" (1932) made him MGM's most important star --- ""Dancing Lady"" (1933)  Gable refused an assignment and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), which won him an Oscar,

Playing a cowboy in his last film, ""The Misfits"" (1961), which was also the final film for co-star Marilyn Monroe, the aging Gable diligently performed his own stunts, taking its toll on his already guarded health. He died from a heart attack before the film was released, Named the #7 greatest actor on The 50 Greatest Screen Legends List by the American Film Institute.

349314,3,6301720539,"Soldier of Fortune is a crowd-pleasing potboiler from the days when Technicolor was glorious (okay, it was shot in De Luxe, but the same principle applies) and CinemaScope really was CINEMA-Scope. There's not much action (the final rescue is laughably easy), but Ernest K. Gann's script is snappy fun, Clark Gable and Susan Hayward play well off each other, Michael Rennie and the colourful supporting cast more than earn their pay, Hong Kong probably never looked better on screen and there's a pleasingly lush romantic score from Hugo Friedhofer. Curious to see director Edward Dmytryk, the one member of the Hollywood Ten to recant (after being appalled at the Party's treatment of his family while he was in prison), turning in such an anti-Communist oater, but he handles it with flair. A deathless classic? Hell, no - but grand entertainment.

As well as a good 2.35:1 transfer there's a good extras package too - audio commentary by Danforth Prince, stills gallery, restoration comparison, the original theatrical trailer and trailers for Gable's The Call of the Wild and The Tall Men.",1210896000,11,1092,5.066666666666666
349315,3,6301720539,"In search of her missing photographer husband, Jane Hoyt (Susan Hayward) arrives in Hong Kong and learns at the U.S. Consulate that her mission is futile, that neither the United States nor the British government can help her...

She turns in despair to Hank Lee (Clark Gable), an American soldier of fortune who runs a profitable smuggling business on each side of the bamboo curtain...

Hank is attracted to Jane's sultry red-haired beauty... He develops a personal interest in the lady, but when she repulses his advances, he realizes that the only way to win her over is to rescue her husband... Aided by an incorruptible English harbor policeman, Inspector Merryweather (Michael Rennie), he discovers that her husband is being held prisoner near Canton, where he is being brainwashed...

Hank prepares to rescue Hoyt in his powered junk, Chicago, and is annoyed to find Inspector Merryweather aboard... Since the inspector knows the nature of Hank's merchandise, he was held prisoner aboard the sailing vessel... Later, however, when Hank's crewmen desert rather than enter Red China, Merryweather, realizing that this is a rescue mission, offers his help...

Clark Gable was getting a little too old for these kinds of actions, but the film holds attention with its good yarn and its interesting locations...

Hayward looks different without her famous long tresses... This was her second movie with the tall, gaunt Michael Rennie... She had one scene with him in 'Demetrius and the Gladiators.'

Ironically, this anticommunist adventure film was directed by Edward Dmytryk, one of the 'Hollywood Ten.'",1168646400,30,1608,5.237354085603113
