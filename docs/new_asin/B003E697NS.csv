8395326,5,B003E697NS,"SciQ is one of my children's favourite DVD series!  Sure, teenage hosts Paula, Andrew, and Pemma are completely goofy (especially the corny co-star competitiveness of the first two), but my kids eat it up.

The complete series includes four volumes:

1 - CSI, Spies, Movie Magic, and Sound
2 - Underwater, Snow, and Flight
3 - Poop (a family fave here), Bugs (also great), and Robots
4 - Food, Human Performance, and Wild Wheels

Each of the subtopics is an episode, and the total play time of the four DVDs is almost 6 hours.  In each episode, Paula and Andrew go on different quest type, real world science exploration, adventures (often two per topic, sometimes they do team up), while Pemma explores an offshoot topic in an intermission style break in the action.  As a result, each topic is explored from a variety of hands-on, real world angles.

We've watched each and every one of the DVDs multiple times, and while we sometimes have an extended break from the series, we've often 'rediscovered' it, resulting in binge-like watching.

Fun science, a good mix of high interest topics, and goofy hosts.  SciQ is just a lot of fun!

I received a free review copy of this title, all thoughts are my own.",1463097600,,1207,4.677725118483412
8395327,5,B003E697NS,Probably my daughter's favorite science show period. Love that girls are regularly featured DOING science. Ranks up there with Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye. Wish there were more seasons.,1442016000,,181,5.275862068965517
8395328,5,B003E697NS,"I would recommend this series to any school teacher or homeschooler.
It is fun, entertaining and educational.
It is action packed, so do not worry about the kids getting bored.
They also introduce the viewer to places and products they probably never thought existed.",1392854400,,267,5.090909090909091
8395329,5,B003E697NS,"Very entertaining but educational. My son loves this series, which we found at our local library, but they have only the first 2 disks and they're usually both checked out. He requests them frequently. He'll be so happy when he opens this and has all 4 DVD's to watch anytime!",1298073600,,276,4.54
8395330,5,B003E697NS,This will keep kids totally engaged! One of my CDs was damaged and the seller replaced it with a whole new set immediately.,1291680000,,123,4.391304347826087
