8207084,4,B000SXQDIC,"I LOVE GERMAN SHEPERDS AND LIKED THIS VIDEO VERY MUCH. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WAS A LITTLE SHORT. IT HAD THE HISTORY AND WHAT GERMAN SHEPERDS ARE USED FOR, BUT I WAS ALSO HOPING THEY'D HAVE A SEGMENT ON GETTING A GERMAN SHEPERD PUPPY FROM A SHELTER AND HOW TO PREPARE YOUR HOUSE FOR ONE AND OF IT IN GENERAL WHEN YOU HAVE ONE AS A PET. I'M STILL VERY GLAD I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ONLY GOOD VIDEO I COULD FIND ABOUT GERMAN SHEPERDS. WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO GET MORE.",1370390400,,482,4.08421052631579
