1834725,1,B00008DDGI,"I was very, very disappointed in this video.
Consider the following:
1. It has God depicted as a triagle with an eye in it hovering and floating.
2. It has fish coming out of the water, growing legs and turning into animals (this is certainly not biblical but the Evolution theory at its best)
3. Adam and Eve are depicted as crazed in a dramatic storm in the middle of a lake up a tree.

It's a shame that Charleston Heston's name is associated with this junk.",1242950400,4,461,4.2988505747126435
1834726,5,B00008DDGI,"This DVD production of the story of the Apostles has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, recognizing not everyone shares the same love and faith in Jesus, early believers suffered tremendously because of their faith, and understanding we need to continue to share our faith in Jesus just as the Apostles did. My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale. One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of the Apostles. I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture. There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference. As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, recognizing not everyone shares the same love and faith in Jesus, early believers suffered tremendously because of their faith, and understanding we need to continue to share our faith in Jesus just as the Apostles did.",1191542400,8,1368,4.8008474576271185
1834727,1,B00008DDGI,"This video is titled ""Apostles""... but there are only 2 of the 12 even mentioned in the program.  I am very disappointed in it, and it does nothing to further the teaching of our young children about the calling of the first Apostles who learned the Faith directly from Jesus.",1190246400,9,276,4.52
1834728,1,B00008DDGI,"I agree with T. Rose's review.  The fish turned to tiger's (evolution), God was presented as the ""all seeing eye"".  Eve was Adam's ""friend"" instead of wife.  The list goes on.  We were very disappointed.",1174694400,6,203,4.714285714285714
1834729,3,B00008DDGI,"I agree with the above review about the several problems with this video. I just ordered all 13 dvd's of this series. We watched Jonah last night, and that was a good one. This was was disappointing. I don't understand why these bible series' can't just stick to the story as it is written in scriptures.

1)They have to add all these imaginary things that never happen in real life.

2)In this particular video they added way too much dialog that isn't noted in the scripture, some which is questionable.

3)I totally hated how they didn't follow the scriptures consistantly in this story. They had Adam and Eve name the animals instead of Adam naming them before Eve was created. This was probably done to keep from offending people who are feminists. I hate that kind of stuff with a passion.

4) I did not care for God being an all seeing eye--which is a masonic/cult symbol.

The above review by T. Rose is a good one. If you want to read a very good review, I would point you to read his.",1171411200,14,994,4.409836065573771
1834730,1,B00008DDGI,"Even though Charlton Heston gives a 3 star rating for the opening 5 minutes dialog explaining what happened in the garden.  The animation was very troubling.

1) They had fish turn into tigers.

2) They had land animals created on the 5th day instead of the 6th.

3) They had God as the ""All seeing eye""

4) They had Eve being created before the naming of the animals.

5) They had the angels guarding the garden look more like little mad children rather than something to fear.

6) They had the fig leaves magically became animal skins

7) Oh yeah the big one.  They have our whole purpose is to make it back to the Garden of Eden.

Each of these troubling parts is very important when trying to explain what the Bible really says.  You may think I am too legalist about these items.  That is fine for truth does matter to me and for my children.  I over looked a lot of creative liberty in the story, but the above mentioned problems I can not over look.  If you want any truth avoid this video.",1149724800,34,997,4.262032085561497
1834731,4,B00008DDGI,"You can't go wrong with this when the price is so low. The animation quality is like that typically seen in basic Saturday morning cartoons, which is good enough for kids. What I like is that all the videos in this series give all the important details of the story, rather than giving a shallow, watered-down version as is usually the case in children's stories. These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. The only reason I didn't give this series a 5 is that each video has a hokey song that could definitely have been left out, but for such a low price and good script, I can overlook that.",1121990400,19,671,4.508196721311475
1834732,5,B00008DDGI,"My 5 and 4yo daughters love this series in general. I haven't seen many other bible videos to compare this to but the story really helped bring Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel to life. It also sparked lots of questions to discuss with my children.",1104796800,,240,4.355555555555555
1834764,5,B00008DDGI,"These children's Bible Stories are very well done. The only problem I have with them is they are close to an hour long and my classes are about an hour long, so it leaves little time for discussion, etc. Other than that, I would recommend them to anyone working with children.",1432166400,,276,4.431372549019608

1834766,2,B00008DDGI,"Nice idea, but just not done very well.  It's not this particular story, I bought 4 DVDs produced by the same company - they were all lacking.  Can't put my finger on any one issue, but it doesn't keep my attention and, more importantly, it had the same affect on my grandchildren.",1427068800,,281,4.384615384615385

1834796,1,B00008DDGI,"I recently bought this product because i have all the others and apart from the story of moses - i love this series and have been able to use it to teach and share bible truths with my 4 year old daughter. Now  i have no problem with artistic liberties and interpretation , in fact i expect them but this garden of eden went  too far and I certainly do not recommend it to anyone who thinks the Bible is God's word and who choses to believe  God. Here Are some of my issues

1) in the bible the serpent is describe as most subtle of the cattle - it was a four footed animal before the curse of being placed on its belly not a six footed one as depicted in the DVD.  Further it seemed to me that Serpent spoke because he was being used as agent of Lucifrer to decieve Eve and Adam to effect the fall of mankind. this message is crtical to the gospel and it is a message that is  shown  in other areas of scriptue - this is totally lost in a story where all the animals  can talk.

2) In the DVDS' creation story striped fish jump a shore and become tigers - and quite interestingly the DVD then goes on to frequently give many close-ups of tigers throughout the movie though they are doing nothing but walking around. This is to use the power of the subliminal message to anchor home EVOLUTION right there in the CREATION story  - you have got to be kidding me!!!!!! My daughter noticed it at once and asked me why a fish is turing into a tiger. I told her God created tigers and that the DVD is showing a lie.

3) eve appears to be created nearly a week after Adam - that is not what the bible suggests as it suggests that they were both there for the first sabbath with God - what Chapter two  of genesis does is to offer further details about how God made both man and woman - and for that matter it tells of the connection between man and the animals. Read Genesis chater 1 and see for yourself

4) Oh the other way it sings EVOLUTION is that  God made the animals in the sea and birds of the air on the same day - but this movie does not show the birds of the air as being created  on that day - why - i can only think becuase that would shoot a whole through the Evoloution Theory - which teached that life began in water. Well, folks i beleive in Creation becuase  I know God is real and he is bigger than me and he can sustain and create and call things into being in away that defies my logic - and if we study nature and even the wonder of a baby - we see it every day - we serve a great big mighty and powerful God - and that is a god by definition - he is beyond you  - beyond explaining stop trying to box him into to what our finite minds can comprehend.

In short do not show this to your kids if you believe the bible's account of creation and if you believe the bible period.",1334620800,3,2791,3.971326164874552

1834798,5,B00008DDGI,"I ordered severeal of these to show to my kids.  As we read each story I wanted to show them the movie behind it.  The kids enjoyed these very much and at a inexpensive cost, it is definitely worth it.  It's very engaging and can allow for much interaction with the kids.",1278028800,,271,4.173076923076923
1834799,1,B00008DDGI,"Just about all of the editions in the ""Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible"" are excellent - good story telling and they at least attempt to stick to the Biblical script and scriptures - NOT ""The Garden of Eden"" - YHVH as the sun in the sky and the ""all seeing eye"" - and then a very silly, bizarre, and uncalled for section with Eve and the Serpent - not to mention the just plain disregard for the Bible. This is supposed to be ""safe"" for kids to watch. We just threw this one away - time to watch Joshua or Moses or Daniel or Sampson...but not this poorly executed edition.
