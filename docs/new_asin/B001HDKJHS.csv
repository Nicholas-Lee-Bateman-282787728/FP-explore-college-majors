8473949,1,B001HDKJHS,"Seems to me I was sent a bootleg copy of this product.  VERY disappointed because this was a Christmas present for my fiance who is a die-hard fan of Eddie Van Halen.  The DVD didn't look anything like the picture and it was sent in a clear plastic case, nothing else.  You can't hear the instructor because the same lick from ""You Really Got Me"" keeps playing throughout the intro.  You can't select anything from the menu.  Don't waste your money.",1263254400,,449,4.493827160493828
