This is one of my absolute favorites because it features an episode almost exclusively devoted to Benjamin Gimm (The Thing).  He is kidnapped and taken into space to compete in a gladatorial arena.  I enjoy the stories where the hero is on their own removed from their normal habitat and on their own facing foes in a foreign land so to speak.

The second episode is a classic from the 1967 Spider-Man featuring a bizarre villain named Skymaster and his floating blimp of ill repute.  Tons of fun!

If you enjoy these old cartoons then pick this up as they are becoming harder and harder to find.  Happy hunting!!",1327017600,,868,4.443037974683544
