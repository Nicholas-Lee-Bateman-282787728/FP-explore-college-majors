8111451,4,B000EMSLR8,"In Los Astronautas(1964), Viruta(Marco Antonio Campos) and Capulina(Gaspar Henaine) help two cute girls from Venus(Norma Mora and Gina Romand) battle a Martian invasion. This film predates Leonard Part 6(1986, starring Bill Cosby) and The Adventures of Pluto Nash(2001, starring Eddie Murphy). Being a product of its time, some of the gags are dated. Viruta and Capulina are inexplicably able to breath in outer space! Sci-fi cliches such as Jetsons-ish sets and half naked, beautiful women in garish clothes are sprinkled in the film. However, this film was made in a comic vein...so it shouldn't be taken too seriously. Roberto Gomez Bolanos, alias Chespirito, wrote the script. Some of the gags from this film have been recycled on episodes of TV's El Chavo and El Chapulin Colorado:

>Capulina getting punched during word games
>Ray guns that can freeze people and objects
>Alien technology splitting people in half

This was one of the more ambitious Viruta and Capulina films. There's giant spaceships, ghastly Martians, and panoramic views of cities on Venus. Imagery like this is difficult to produce for a modern Mexican film since more time and effort is put into television. Los Astronautas is still packed with lots of side-splitting gags:

>Viruta getting hit in the head with a rock
>Capulina getting chased by a robotic dog
>Antonio Raxel getting hit by a pile of dirt

Typically, in a Viruta and Capulina comedy, the female leads were ""window dressing"". They were expected to look pretty and fall in love with Viruta and Capulina. A three dimensional role for a woman was very rare in a Viruta and Capulina movie.
In the music department, Gustavo Cesar Carrion's 'Viruta and Capulina March' is very catchy. Los Astronautas(1964) is good retro fun from 1960's Mexico.",1257206400,,1782,5.11340206185567
