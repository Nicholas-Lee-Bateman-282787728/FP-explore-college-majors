8423917,5,B004CYF7LC,"I have several collections of Johnny Carson. I will miss him every day until I die. I can remember watching him with my father. That thirty years went by awful fast. Nobody has come close since. Stephen Colbert, I am counting on you!  I miss running into people in a store and hearing them say, ""Did you see Carson last night?"" We had whole conversations just about him.",1439683200,,370,4.4411764705882355
8423918,4,B004CYF7LC,"Video & audio were quite good. At about 30 minutes in total length, only 1/3 is the guest, Sammy Davis. I expected much more. We get JC's monologue(not as funny as I remember & the crowd seemed to agree), JC doing a sketch(not as funny as I remember & the crowd seemed to agree), a very brief interview w/ Sammy, Sammy's performance(what you'd expect - great!) and a very quick trip back to the couch. The whole reason I bought this was for Sammy Davis and I was slightly disappointed w/ his limited/ edited time. Overall, as a Sammy fan, I am pleased w/ the purchase -  used DVR. Probably not one of JC's better monologues or skits though...Note: Sammy's on stage performance seemed to be complete(not edited)...",1373846400,,713,4.5703125
8423919,4,B004CYF7LC,All these shows are nostalgic;  this one was also pretty good.  Good movie to watch when it's raining outside on a cold winter evening.,1355961600,,135,4.583333333333333
8423920,5,B004CYF7LC,"I purchased this Johnny Carson DVD the day it came out.  I've watched it nearly 10 times.  If you are a fan of either Johnny Carson OR Sammy Davis Jr., this episode of the Tonight Show is truly ""priceless"".  Sammy Davis was one of the greatest entertainers of all time.  I gave this one 5 STARS all the way.",1323907200,,307,4.1525423728813555
