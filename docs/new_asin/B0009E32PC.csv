It includes the background artwork used to create the world of Innocence, the music of Kenji Kawai, and the songs performed by Kimiko Ito, the famous Jazz vocalist.",1128556800,,325,5.269230769230769
8059316,5,B0009E32PC,"The Music Anthology disc from Ghost In The Shell 2 is beautiful. It is a collection of seven music tracks from the movie, accompanied by visuals (Not just pan and scan still frames like somebody mentioned in another review, but full fledged 3D work and cell animations too: and loads of it).

The songs are fantastic, the animation is superb. There is no plot, nor is this a shorter or different version of the film. As a matter of fact: you wouldn't know what the movie is about at all watching this dvd. That is fine, because the Music Anthology disc is nothing more than an eye candy soundtrack and clips collection. The picture quality is awesome (no artefacts and blurs here, so I don't know what other reviewer meant when he mentioned this). The sound quality is perfect. I love this disc. It is a relaxing half hour of beautiful music and beautiful imagery. Highly Reccommended! Comes with two bonus videos; one of which had Gabriel the dog in it. Very cute :-)",1125792000,,968,4.563218390804598
