5568854,4,B00BB1LM4A,"If you are not afraid to fall in love than this is the show for you. If you are the type who is too afraid of the good things life might send your way then maybe not. The only fault I would admit is that it starts to get overly predictable towards the middle of the eleven episodes.

If you watch be sure to have someone to hug nearby, you'll need it.",1379808000,4,351,3.875

8565139,4,B00BB1LM4A,"This is a wonderful slice-of-life anime series! It's just one season but that one is all you need. The animation is professional and realistic. The characters are charming and real (rather than 2-D tropes where a character's personality is only one emotion). I would give it 5 stars, except for what I discuss below. If you are a fan of gory anime, or Sci Fi anime, or very violent anime, you will still love this!

My only beef is the expense. For what this is, I would expect to buy it for $19.99 - $29.99.",1487894400,,508,4.347368421052631
8565140,5,B00BB1LM4A,"This is one of my favorite anime, and one of the best slice of life/family centered shows of its kind I have ever seen. It definitely feels like a Miyazaki or Hosoda work in the form of a short eleven episode series. The animation is simple enough, but it is also expressive enough to convey emotions of the characters in its own unique style.  I personally recommend this for anyone who is looking for a heartwarming show about family that is sure to put a grin on your face, and can be watched with your own kids as well.",1467331200,,523,4.282828282828283
8565141,4,B00BB1LM4A,"This is based on the first part of a Japanese manga (serial comic novel).  It's about a man who adopts a child who is his late grandfather's illegitimate child.  Everyone else wanted to leave her at an orphanage.  The story is very cute but quite short.  It has about a dozen 30 minute episodes and is quite expensive for what you get.

Still, I can recommend this series if you like slice of life Japanese animes...",1444348800,,416,4.421052631578948

8565145,5,B00BB1LM4A,I love buying my anime from NIS the only problem is their limited selection of anime.  Quality is top rate.  subtitles are very good. If you're buying this you've already seen how good it is.  I love these slice of life anime.,1414540800,,226,4.333333333333333
8565146,4,B00BB1LM4A,"This series deals with a somewhat uncomfortable topic: what to do with an ""illegitimate"" child after the caretaker passes away. All throughout, right up to the end, the viewer may reach certain conclusions about the lineage of Rin Kaga, but in the end, you'll be relieved. In between, we are presented with a conundrum that almost no one in the family wants to deal with. In Japan, these sort of things are looked upon as shameful--it tarnishes a family name.

A relative of the deceased, realizing that the little girl, Rin, would end up in an orphanage, steps up and makes a very daring decision to take her in and raise her. He quickly discovers the major impacts this huge responsibility has on his life, work and social affairs. But he aligns with some other strong people along the way, and their mutual encouragement helps them cope. One other important character is Yukari, a single mom that he meets at Rin's daycare. They start to do things together, sharing the burdens of picking up the kids after work, etc., and both them and the kids get along well.

What would have made this a perfect ending is if Daikichi and Yukari ended up together. They seem right for each other, and their kids get along like brother and sister. It's like a Japanese 'Brady Bunch'. Unrequited love dampens my opinion just a bit, hence the 4 star rating on what otherwise would be a perfect series. And it was only 11 episodes. There was so much possibility building up in this series, but it just ends with nothing really resolved, or a sense of a strong direction ahead.

The art work takes a bit of getting used too as well. It's somewhere between ""My Neighbors the Yamadas"" and a Studio Ghibli movie of recent vintage. It's very simplistic at times. But the story was full of the subtleties of dealing with every little issue that comes up. The author must have been a single dad. In short, a great film for adults, especially those in a position of raising their kids alone.",1393891200,10,1968,4.5852272727272725
