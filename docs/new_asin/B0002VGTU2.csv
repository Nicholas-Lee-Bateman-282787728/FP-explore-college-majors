8033277,5,B0002VGTU2,You have to go to this event  Crazy speed 200 mph on the back straight away  wow what a thrill to see it on Video,1493078400,,113,3.48
8033278,5,B0002VGTU2,"I don't ride anymore but I love watching the Isle of Man TT. This is a grate DVD with views on and off the motorcycles. I'm sorry but iff I was in charge of this TT I would ban the superbikes on these roads. One mistake and the driver is dead. One mechanical fail, one driver error going through a tunnel and that is that. You watch and you will understand.",1418083200,,357,4.042253521126761
8033279,5,B0002VGTU2,If you like bikes and you do not have any of the iomtt then you're slipping. This is one of the best dvds that I own...thats not porn :),1352764800,,136,3.7241379310344827
8033280,5,B0002VGTU2,It was exactly as specified. I have enjoyed the video many times. Came in perfect condition and have zero complaints.,1286150400,,117,4.9
8033281,5,B0002VGTU2,"You gotta love the TT! That is, if you ride or want to. This is a kind of ""raw"" race. On the streets, all out, trees, houses, farms all fly by at speeds only a few of us will ever attain. Lots of fun. Start the collection now because rumor has it that the ""07 TT, the 100th will be the last!",1142121600,,291,3.7096774193548385
8033282,4,B0002VGTU2,"the video is accurate and covers all the races extensively.

Very interesting are the on board cameras and the interwiews.",1125014400,2,122,5.1
8033283,4,B0002VGTU2,"Bought as a Father's Day gift for my boyfriend, & I enjoyed this also.  Very good!! Camera angles are wonderful, as is background information.  I highly recommend.",1121817600,2,163,5.0
8033284,5,B0002VGTU2,"Excellent again! More of the same stuff we have come to expect from the annual review, only this time theres more. more on boards both facing forward with commentery and data(lean angle, amount of braking and accelerating) and a map so you can follow the rider around the 37 mile curcuit, and a rather odd rear facing camera angle from the dash board, so you can watch the riders body the whole way around. Also more coverage of Mad Sunday and the drag runs.
If you're at all interested in Motorcycle racing then you'll really enjoy watching these guys race around a road course doing upto 170MPH only inches away from stone walls, lamp posts and the spectactors.",1107388800,10,663,4.627118644067797
8033285,4,B0002VGTU2,Good onboard shots and in-depth coverage of this sport that many in North America may not be familiar with.  Tremendous onboard action and coverage.  Very long and covers nearly all the classes.  Non-motorcyclists may find it a bit tedious due to the length.,1104710400,3,258,4.953488372093023
