3516345,5,B001CQONMW,"I just love the Girlfriends series and its unfortunate that the show got cancelled but being able to watch them over and over again via DVD release is the best alternative to having the actual show air on television.  Season 5 is one of my favorite seasons because of the different levels shown to their friendships, relationships, and emotions. I've immediately placed my order for Season 6 once I saw i was getting close to finish watching Season 5.",1235952000,,451,4.708860759493671

3516352,5,B001CQONMW,"Girlfriends the fifth season has got to be the best season for me so far. I have every season 1-5. Every episode on this DVD is funny, very moving and excellent. My girls Joan, Maya, Toni and Lynn is definitely great actresses and i cannot believe there is no more girlfriends. OH HELL NO.. I'm really disappointed with CW. However i'm still happy because i have 3 more seasons to collect. I recommend this DVD what am i saying i mean seasons 1-5 and buy seasons 6,7 and 8 when they get released. I 4 sure will be.",1227571200,2,514,4.255102040816326
3516353,5,B001CQONMW,"Girlfriends - The Fifth Season is definitely the best season of this funny and poignant show. The writing and acting drastically matured, Joan, Maya, Toni, and Lynn are smart, successful, and beautiful women who always go after what they want. This show is so under-rated, it's like Sex and the City. I am so happy each season has been coming out at steady pace, only three seasons left. I highly recommend this gem of a purchase, enjoy!",1220832000,9,437,4.688311688311688

3516425,3,B001CQONMW,"Ok season one was good and ended on a high note, season two reveals it was only a joke season three was ok.
but it seems like the seasons keep getting shorter and shorter it seems each month a buy the next season I get less and less satisfied.
its like they stopped trying. they only try when the last episode comes about.",1370476800,,322,4.126984126984127

I apologize about the late feedback.

I will be looking into purchasing another DVD soon because my partner and I have already watched this full DVD.",1359676800,,161,4.714285714285714
3516448,4,B001CQONMW,"Although some of the story lines vexed me to no end & it was more drama than comedy, I thought that the writers did a good job of giving us insight into the main characters.

The story lines I enjoyed were Joan's struggles to open a tapas bar and experiencing the highs & lows of owning a business; Toni's pregnancy and Lynn's relationship issues with a band mate.

Kudos to Persia White as Lynn. She was really great this season as we got to see her character's confusion and hurt in dealing with a man who doesn't want to be in a monogamous relationship

I have to commend this group of actors again for bringing these characters to life and the flow of the stories that kept me watching the entire season in one evening.  My only negative about this set is that once again we got no extras.",1347062400,,793,4.302013422818792
3516449,3,B001CQONMW,"I had bought this DVD & when I played it I wasn't really able to watch the 1st disc due to it kept freezing & skipping, it wasn't scratched or anything but it did not want to work well.",1342051200,,185,3.769230769230769
3516450,3,B001CQONMW,"I have really been enjoying the Girlfriends series up until this 5th Season.  I have enjoyed the comedy, drama and comradery between the ladies, and guest stars; however, the main theme that the show began with is seeming to fade as the 5th season wears on.  They started out successful Black women with at least a recognizable ""African American"" togetherness and ""modern day Black woman successful kind of attitude.""  However, I don't know whether the girls are coming or going by the end of the second disk.  The drama is becoming somewhat vague, and the sincerity not quite as believable.  Toni has gone from a very defined ""Black woman from Fresno"" to this upper class acting elitist.  It doesn't make sense.  Joan's drama is continuing to spriral in a way that's not adding up, and it's becoming redundantly annoying.  She still has her moments of brilliance though, and I do love it.  Lynn has spun off into this ridiculous journey of ""try anything, do anything"" once again and is no longer stable.  Mya has waited two years lying to herself saying that she doesn't want Darnell back, but now she admits that she does want him back now that he's getting married again...?  All in all, I still enjoyed it, and I'm now watching the beginning of season 6 in hopes that things will somehow calm down a bit and head back towards a believable script that is cohesive for all the women, because I really do enjoy this show.",1334188800,,1422,4.648
3516451,4,B001CQONMW,"Now that I am on Season 5, these literally have become my friends.  I am watching through Netflix so I only get one disc at a time so it is very frustrating to me to have to wait to see what happens.

Disc 1

This disc introduces us to Joan's mother.  I wondered why Joan never spent the holidays with her family.  Now, we see that Joan's mother is selfish and beds younger men.  In earlier episodes we saw that Joan's father was selfish and had little to do with her.

On this disc, Maya is still a book author and is the character that is showing the most growth.  I like Ronnie, the cousin, but again I am curious how someone so close to their mother could have such limited or no contact with her.

Joan and William are trying to get together.  I may be one of the few people that don't want them together, but UGH! Joan is anal and crazy and William is quirky an corny; these two should not get together in my opinion.

Lynne is acting ridiculous now.  She is in her 30's and has decided to become a robot.

The worst written character, but MY FAVORITE, is Toni.  Toni is not likeable on disc 1.  She is beyond selfish and her over eating is out of character and annoying.  Toni fought hard to leave her Fresno roots behind and this baby has her falling asleep at meetings and eating food off other people's plates; this doesn't seem like the Toni I KNOW.  I really wish they could have found a white guy more compatible for Toni and left him in town.

Disc 2
Lynne meets her biological father and the meeting doesn't go well.  It is good to see from Lamont from Sanford and Son again.  Maya's agent is giving her run around so she decides to write porn.  Joan and William ended up staying in a rat infested hotel room, not having sex.  Joan and William refuse to show their affection in public.  Maya explains to us why we rarely see her son.  Lynne explains to us why we never see her sex partners and Toni explains to us why she is not living broke even though she is claiming broke.

The highs of this disc is that we get to see Shirley from Laverne and Shirley an Toni is more subdued this disc.

The lows of this dic are Maya's clothing.  Maya has NO butt and really should not wear low rider jeans or short shorts.  Lynne being broke and a sex fiend are way past old now.

Disc 3
The high of the disc was that Mary Ann from Gilligan Island shows up in an episode.  Another high of this disc is that someone changes Toni's life; we can only hope it is for the better.

The low of this disc is Lynne and her her new boyfriend.  Lynne's boyfriend looks horrible, sounds horrible, and treats her horrible.  Lynne actually begs this guy to love her in bunch of a front of people; it was embarrassng.  The other low of this disc was TONI's attitude and the cradle incident.  What Toni did with the cradle was despicable.  It really is surprising that Toni has any friends.

This season was GOOD, but I must say that a pregnant Toni is much worse than ordinary Toni.",1306627200,3,2971,4.203900709219858
3516452,5,B001CQONMW,"There's not much to say but, a really great show. Some of the topics that the woman go through are easy to relate to and others are entertainment, but its super funny. My husband even watches with me sometimes.",1283212800,,210,4.410256410256411

8288793,5,B001CQONMW,"The drama was thick this season-- but still the show captures the funny and loving element that has been apart of previous seasons. I think each of the girls (+william) go into newer directions of character growth.
