7889987,3,6305472351,"I truly adore Carlo Maria Giulini, especially his later recordings and performances, but this is a very shallow interpretation of this momumental masterpiece (one of my favorite compositions). I'm sure it has to do with the fact that there were limited rehearsals from musicians coming from all over the globe, because Giulini's other performance (on DG, on CD) is absolutely astonishing.",1287273600,8,388,5.377049180327869
7889988,5,6305472351,"I admit straight away to having ""an interest"" in this recording. It was of the inaugural performance of the World Philharmonic Orchestra, in Stockholm in December 1985, the members being drawn from top orchestras from round the world, and my wife, an oboist, was representing her orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO). Since it was a performance for charity, all the players and conductor gave their services without fee, (their expenses being met by a variety of sponsors, the main one being SAS, the Scandinavian Airline). Carlo Maria Giulini had been invited to conduct and they (the orchestra and he) spent a week in snowy Stockholm, getting to know each other before the performance. As to the performance itself? Inevitably the initial rehearsals were somewhat chaotic, since wind and brass sections were made up of players not just from different cultural backgrounds - for example, western European oboists, eastern European horns and clarinets, all accustomed to different pitch, and using different traditions of vibrato, but some sections without a first or even second common language. (Sign language came to the rescue on several ocasions, by all accounts!). Then there was the small issue of a violin section consisting of 16 concertmasters from all over, each of whom had his or her idea of how to lead the piece! However by the time of the actual performance, all these cultural issues had been melded into a really memorable performance, which is what we have on this DVD - a unique sound record of some very special musical moments for many of the players, and for the listeners.",1275609600,10,1619,5.044776119402985
7889989,3,6305472351,"One of my favourite modern conductors.
I don't mind much about the recorded sound, but the sound of the orchestra must be musical well mixed. Here we have soloists from some 60 countries, including some Indians and some Asians players whatever lumping together for I don't know how long. It's pointless to expect much from such a combination.
The photpgraphy needs much to be desired as well. Often, we see players from an angle that is not quite natural and then the players are not depicted as a section, nor as a group nor are they maninly the soloist(s). Even the seating needs to be re-arranged from a photographic point of view. So is the lighting.
Moreover, very often we have depictions of Giulini with his eyes closed for most of the time ( and when he opens his eyes he was not really looking and would close them within a second) murmuring all the time as though he was cursing!  Odd enough.

One of the reasons why I don't really enjoy this performance was, I've just finished watching Eugene Jochum's performance of the same piece with Bamgerger Symphony taped in 1982 and which was way better than this one: it was just like a realist German oil painting from beginning till the last note. Too bad a juxtaposition despite the fact that this one is 4 years younger.",1077667200,,1278,4.576419213973799
7889990,4,6305472351,"Whether or not the sound is the best (and I didn't think it was bad at all), this performance is so fine that I would recommend it over any on video, and even on CD.  (I have no trouble listening even to 78s if the performance is great.)  Giulini believes in every note of this symphony, as do I, and his way of holding the lengthy work together--some conductors, like Mehta, want to rush it here and there to ""get over"" the bridge sections--is masterful.",1006992000,3,455,4.341176470588235
7889991,1,6305472351,"What a disappointment!  Lovers of classical music deserve more than this in the DVD format.  The sound on this DVD includes the old ""tape hiss"" in the background - something listeners of quality CD's have long since  forgotten.  And to add to this, the video quality is often poor!  Fuzzy  pictures, not something you would expect in this new format.  My  recommendation:  skip this DVD and listen to von Karajan and the Vienna  Philharmonic.  A much more enjoyable experience",934588800,27,476,4.89873417721519
