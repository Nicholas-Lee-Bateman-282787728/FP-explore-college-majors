5841615,2,B00DPJH2K4,"I love surf documentaries, but this documentary has almost nothing to bring. The narration reads like slideshow bullet points, and the rest of the dvd is slow motion surfing highlights; which is fine, but don't call it a documentary.  It would make a great screensaver for your computer at least because the video is good quality.",1403827200,,330,4.892857142857143

8596029,5,B00DPJH2K4,Awesome Film !!! Changed my Life !!!,1439942400,,36,4.285714285714286
8596030,5,B00DPJH2K4,My current favorite surf movie.  Presenting the story as a history of surfing and surf boards is more interesting than the standard cowabunga content.,1434326400,,150,5.25
8596031,5,B00DPJH2K4,Excellent movie about the surfing sport history. I would have a PART 2 movie...some important history and surfers where left out.,1434326400,,129,5.190476190476191
8596032,3,B00DPJH2K4,"I liked the film and learned a few things. I read bad reviews on the soundtrack etc, but those details can be subjective. I'm not a filmmaker, so I can't speak to where it ranks. It felt historical and non surfing people can learn a lot about surfing from this film. I did notice a whole branch missing from the surfing tree...SUP surfing you know Ku Hoe he'e nalu. The wise Hawaiians you quote and have commentating in your film SUP surf. A missed opportunity to tell a story that is alive and evolving around the world. That's all I wanted to add. Aloha.",1429488000,,556,4.355769230769231
