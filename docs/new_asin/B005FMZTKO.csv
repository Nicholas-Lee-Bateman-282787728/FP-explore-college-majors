4683280,5,B005FMZTKO,"Last December, I was privileged to see one of the performances of this magnificent holiday concert and have been eagerly awaiting the DVD ever since. The choir was in top form singing of what they love, the dancers were amusing if a little campy, and the narrator Micheal York was expressive and warm. But the standout of the evening was soloist David Archuleta (only 19 at the time) whose voice soared yet caressed each lyric. The love in David's voice was felt by each one of the 10's of thousands in he audience and I know I am not the only one who left with tears in her eyes.",1312588800,35,580,4.330275229357798

4683284,5,B005FMZTKO,"This DVD is easily my all time favorite DVD - Christmas or otherwise!  David Archuletta has an outstanding voice.  Every song he sings is spot on.  Also, like another reviewer wrote, the version of Silent Night is stunning (spoiler alert-he got a standing ovation from the massive audience).  When I watch and hear this young man on this DVD with his flawless inspiring singing I can't help but think ""Let's see David Cook pull this off!""  Also of course, the MTC and the orchestra are absolutely top notch.  It also has Michael York with two dialogues.  One is the history of the choir, and the other is Luke's chapter 2 Christmas story.  Ever since I received this DVD, my folks an I set an evening aside specifically to see this DVD during the Christmas season.  I, of course, see  it a few more times per season!  Buy ""Glad Christmas Tidings.""  You will not be disappointed.",1422144000,,878,4.593548387096774

4683286,5,B005FMZTKO,The Mormon Tabernacle Choir with David Archuleta - It just doesn't get any better than that!!!,1404777600,,94,4.9375
4683287,3,B005FMZTKO,"While David Archuleta is a teen idol, his voice simply does not match that required by this choir and orchestra. The annual Christmas Concerts (provided free to the public and recorded for broadcast the following year) are best served by strong singers who are used to projecting their sound in public performances without aid of special amplification. Otherwise, the usual fair of outstandingly arranged Christmas Choral music and Orchestra is well worth adding to the holiday collection.",1391040000,,489,5.363636363636363
4683288,5,B005FMZTKO,The music was so festive and made you feel as if you were at  the concert. I would purchase more MT Cds,1389830400,,103,3.6818181818181817

4683292,5,B005FMZTKO,"I have wanted this Dvd for as long as it has been available, and that is what I asked for, for Christmas this last year, and magically it appeared under the Christmas tree. I must have been a good girl last year!",1373068800,,212,4.071428571428571
4683293,5,B005FMZTKO,The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is a fantastic group and is David Archuleta is such an iconic figure that putting the two together is pure genius.,1370649600,,142,4.72
4683294,5,B005FMZTKO,"We watched David Archuleta come in second on American Idol in that year. We had hoped that the nation agreed with us that over all David was the best candidate for the number one winning spot on American Idol that year. But, as we all know being number one winner on American Idol doesn't mean that the winner is going to be accepted by the public and a long musical career will follow. In David's case he helped produce this GREAT musical extravaganza for Christmas recently. We bought a copy and have really enjoyed the splendor of the Choir and David's performances. This is a beautiful combination of the Tabernacle Choir and David's talents brought together for this beautiful presentation! We recommend it to any one that appreciates beautiful music and it can be viewed any time during the year!",1369094400,,802,4.735714285714286

4683296,5,B005FMZTKO,"Glad christmas Tidings Featuring David archuleta and Michael York was actually not what I had planned on ordering. However, all of the customer reviews rated it so highly, it changed my mind, and I ended up ordering it. I am extremely pleased with my decision.",1359072000,,260,4.8
4683297,5,B005FMZTKO,This is easily one of the very best and most inspiring of all Christmas concerts.  My family and I will enjoy seeing it over and over.,1358553600,,134,4.153846153846154
4683298,5,B005FMZTKO,"David Archuleta is a delightful entertainer. When his talents are paired with those of the tried-and-true Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square, the entire concert is without a doubt must-see and must-own.",1356825600,,226,5.485714285714286

4683300,5,B005FMZTKO,"I've always been a fan of David Archuleta's, and to have a live DVD of him singing Christmas favorites is absolutely amazing, especially with such a great choir. David makes those listening FEEL the music and the meaning behind it. This is such a great production and I really wish I could have been there! The orchestra is also really great. I highly recommend this for any music lover.",1355443200,,387,4.6231884057971016

4683303,5,B005FMZTKO,"Every Christmas season, the renowned and beloved Mormon Tabernacle Choir presents a holiday concert in their Conference Center at Salt Lake City.  This spectacular venue seats over 20-thousand people and it is the perfect setting for the Choir's amazing productions.  Tickets for these concerts are given away via a random selection process and obtaining them would be comparable to getting tickets to see the Pope, if such was the case.  Anyone who has had the privilege of attending one of these performances will tell you how positively and astonishingly wonderful they are both visually and musically.  Each year the Choir chooses a guest narrator  who delivers one or two readings and one or two guest artists who sing during the concert with the Choir.  On this particular concert, which was performed two years ago, the guest narrator was the distinguished actor Michael York and the musical guest artist was David Archuleta.  This was the Choir's first BluRay release, although the DVDs of their annual Christmas concerts have been released for years.  Technically, these concerts are truly state-of-the-art productions.  The Mormons spare no expense in presenting picture and sound quality that is second to none.  In conclusion, I can only say that if heaven ever put on a Christmas concert to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir would be God's only choice.",1350172800,2,1396,5.164444444444444
4683304,4,B005FMZTKO,"Even though I'm not Mormon, I bought this album because of David Archuleta (who is Mormon), who sings some songs on the DVD. It's a really good concert for Christmas, with some traditional Christmas songs, and Michael York is also great! I highly recommend this DVD, you're being a Mormon or not.",1338336000,,296,4.711538461538462
4683305,5,B005FMZTKO,"The Glad Christmas Tidings Blu-ray video featuring the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and guests David Archuleta and Michael York, is a pleasure to watch and listen to. David Archuleta did a great performance and all of the features of this video presentation were of high quality and well done. This is one of my favorite Christmas Season programs.",1336435200,,343,5.035087719298246
4683306,4,B005FMZTKO,"Amazing concert, good arrangements, very large symphonic orchestra with choir, organ, dancers, a stage full of very professional artists. A spectacular Christmas !",1327449600,,163,6.130434782608695
4683307,3,B005FMZTKO,"David Archuleta is a fine young man with a beautiful voice, however just not powerful enough for a choir of this size.  Perhaps in a few years.  Although I found the history of the mormans interesting, since I've loved their music from the time I was a child, however I think they took way too much time from the concert telling it's history.  It could have been told in 5 or 6 minutes rather than  the over 15 that they took.",1325980800,2,426,4.222222222222222
4683308,4,B005FMZTKO,"This concert was awesome! I love traditional Christmas music, and no one does it better than MoTab.
David Archuletta's performance was amazing. His smile and showmanship added an air of joy and playfulness long missing from Tab choir performances. I was worried that Archuletta's voice was too soft and the choir would drown him out. But thanks to some brilliant musical arrangements he and the choir complimented each other perfectly.
Michael York's part was a little long, and I could do without the obligatory instrumental arrangement that no one's ever heard of. All in all though; you won't be disappointed, this was a great concert.",1325462400,3,638,5.085714285714285
4683309,5,B005FMZTKO,"Love this dvd has the great chior and david archuleta, what a wonderful combo. David has the most beautiful voice and he really knows how to connect to the audience.",1324944000,3,165,4.533333333333333
4683310,3,B005FMZTKO,"Good, but not same quality as previous years. Michael York is extremely capable but somehow didn't get it with regard to this kind of Christmas presentation among 22,000 + people going out to a  possible 14 million. His comments behind the scene were disappointing. Clearly not a religious person nor one who understands the sacred nature of Christ's birth. David Archuleta was OK, but always at the back of your mind is that any of the choir could do just as well and possibly better. The floor show was a shadow of previous years as was the general atmosphere.  Overall, the feeling lingers that the budget was slashed and a somewhat watered down concert is the result.
OK, but hopefully this year's concert is much better. We will find our next December.",1323561600,5,757,4.7272727272727275
4683311,5,B005FMZTKO,David Archuleta makes me smile!!  Love this young man and his awesome voice!! Saw him in concert and loved every minute!  Can't purchase a better Christman DVD!,1320364800,9,160,4.888888888888889
4683312,5,B005FMZTKO,We wwere not able to see this concert in person last year.  I am so happy to receive this DVD and CD set with my Amazon reward points.  It is a beautiful concert that we will enjoy each Christmas for many years.,1320192000,2,211,4.0
4683313,5,B005FMZTKO,"Once again the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra's Christmas offering makes for superb visual and aural entertainment with unequalled sound and picture quality - just magnificent!  Each year the programs are becoming more spectacular, and this, the latest in 2011 on DVD is a testament to the on-going commitment of all of those concerned in its production, from the television director Lee Wessman to the conductor Mack Wilberg and every competent volunteer in between.  It goes without saying that they are truly professional in every respect of their craft.

What a refreshing talent David Archuleta is in this modern dysfunctional world of greed and unhappiness.  Not only does he sing with a glorious pitch-perfect tone, but his eyes simply glow with the joy of singing with such a marvelous choir and orchestra in front of an audience of some 21,000 appreciative concert-goers in one of the world's largest concert halls.  He is certainly a top role-model for today's youth.

The other prominent guest artist is the fine British actor of stage, screen and television, Michael York [ Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (68); Cabaret (72) and as John the Baptist in Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth (77) ] who beautifully narrates the story of the Tabernacle Choir's humble beginnings in Wales to their formation as a choir in a pioneering Salt Lake City.  This disc also contains Backstage interviews with David Archuleta and Michael York.  Well worth the viewing.

Having said all of that I can heartily recommend 'Glad Christmas Tidings' as an uplifting and beautiful escape from the troubled world we live in today.  I might also recommend re-visiting some of the past Tabernacle Choir's Christmas programs of the 21st century that are still available to buy on DVD.

For the true DVD buff:  This program is anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) and NOT 1.33 and the running time is 73 minutes and NOT 66 minutes as listed incorrectly on this sites product information.

Enjoy!",1318550400,12,1975,5.096273291925466
4683314,5,B005FMZTKO,I bought the DVD but I made my comment on the CD. Sorry. I wish I could fix it. But I can't.,1316304000,4,92,3.227272727272727
4683315,5,B005FMZTKO,"My adorable, magical, musical monkey-boy pretend-imaginary son, David Archuleta --- the kid I lost at the mall in 1997 whom some nice family in Utah found and raised and he's just fine --- rings in Jesus' birthday with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and I couldn't be happier.

Watching the MOTAB Christmas specials every year was already a family tradition for ages, but having The Official Cutest Human Being Ever Born (well, at least since Jesus himself) as this year's guest just makes it that much more special.

No, my impulse to take Archuleta home, give him a room, a basket of kittens and cupcakes, and pay for his college will likely never come to pass. But events like this, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas Concert, is the next best thing to having him in your living room, giggling, gasping and warbling angelically.

Why the American music industry ignores (and, in fact, actively squelches) talented, money-making and popularity-poll winning people like Archuleta while giving all their support and promotion to magazine cover-ready kids who can't sing and need Autotune 24/7 is a mystery --- except that the latter are easier to ""control"" (i.e., yank the Autotune chord, and their careers are over). Meanwhile, David's a significant star overseas.

We need more David Archuletas. Not fewer.",1316131200,10,1308,5.098130841121495
4683316,5,B005FMZTKO,"I was not able to attend the actual performance, but this DVD is the next best thing.  The choir and orchestra were amazing as usual, but David Archuleta was the icing on the cake. The youngest person to ever be invited to sing with the choir in their Christmas program, David did not disappoint.  He has such maturity of voice and performance that it is hard to believe that he was still 19 when he performed with the choir. I loved his story telling ability with The Cat and the Mouse.  I felt that I was there watching the story unfold.  He sings effortlessly in Spanish, and his Silent Night is my favorite rendition of anyone I have ever heard. He sings with such respect and caresses each word with that glorious voice.  Finally we get a live performance on DVD by David.  It proves what his fans already know...that he is a master of the live performance.",1315612800,12,862,4.424050632911392
4683317,5,B005FMZTKO,"Though I have and will continue to travel far and wide to see the wonderful musical talent that is David Archuleta, I was not among the lucky few who attended this Christmas concert, and have waited since last December to finally see this dvd.  It does not disappoint.  The show is a beautiful, traditional, and joyful celebration of the Christmas holiday, the Choir is on point, as one would expect, and Michael York an elegant pro.  But, by far and away, for me, it is David Archuleta that shines with his characteristic grace, stunning vocals, and polished professionalism beyond his young years.  David elevates any music he sings, and particularly Christmas songs, which he says are among his favorites and most meaningful to perform, and are a fit for his stunning vocals and the emotionality he evokes from a song. As someone else said here, he doesn't sing, but rather caresses each lyric, finding the emotion in each song and telling the story with careful intention.
He is a master craftsman with music.
My neighbors must wonder why they hear Christmas music coming from my condo in early Sept., but they better get used to it...as with David's ""Christmas From The Heart"" cd, this performance dvd will be enjoyed in my home all year, when the spirit moves...it is, after all, simply beautiful music!  This dvd is one for anyone's Christmas collection.  Well Done & Thank You.",1315440000,19,1385,4.822784810126582
4683318,5,B005FMZTKO,Only few of us were very blessed to see this live and now that it has come out on DVD those who didn't see it can now feel what we felt on that day. I totally recomend it even if you are not LDS/Mormon you would love it especially with the Christmas season coming up. I would problably listen to it even if it not around Christmas because I just love David's angelic voice. One of my favorite songs is the Los Pastores a Belen sang in spanish and the one that got me all teary was defitnetly Silent Night. Don't miss on buying this wonderful DVD!,1315353600,7,546,4.11214953271028
4683319,5,B005FMZTKO,"I had the privilege, too, to watch the live concert in Salt Lake City. I flew from Boston to see David and the choir together. That was a dream come true. David was superb, his velvet voice, his radiant smile, his good look ( he looked gorgeous in his tuxedo) and that wonderful choir of angels just made worth every single cent I spent to get there. I'm so happy to have  this DVD soon. Since David was at American Idol I dreamed of a Christmas DVD with him and the Mormon Tabernacle choir. It's a tradition in our house to trim our Christmas tree while listening and watching to a DVD by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. What a treat we have now!",1315267200,8,644,4.235772357723577
4683320,5,B005FMZTKO,"I was lucky enough to have been gifted tickets to see David Archuleta's Christmas performance with the Morman Tabernacle Choir.  Drove 11 hours to Utah to see the concert and I was completely blown away.  David's voice filled that venue.  David's vocals are beyond amazing and singing these Christmas songs with such reverence and respect left me speechless.

It was great to see the reactions of non David fans in the audience, including my hubby lol.  They had complete look of amazement and all nodding there heads in approval.

My favorites of the night were Los Pastores A Belen, The Cat and Mouse Carol, Silent Night was heavenly.  David doesn't sing a bad song with those pitch perfect, velvety rich, strong vocals. I can't wait to watch on PBS this fall and to receive my copies :)",1313625600,26,789,4.7153284671532845
