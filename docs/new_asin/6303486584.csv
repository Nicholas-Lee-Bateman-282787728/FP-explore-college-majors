662039,1,6303486584,"I was very disappointed with this. It is badly cut (i.e. sections of the original movie are missing), very low quality video, and the picture only takes up about 50% of the screen window (which is probably good, blown up to full screen it would probably be un-watchable).  The ""product details"" on the website are misleading in that it infers that you are getting a DVD disk.  What you actually get is a ""DVD Movie"", i.e. playable only on a computer or similar device.  It WILL NOT play on your standard home DVD player.  I feel like returning it and asking for my money back!

If you want a copy of this movie I suggest you try to find an old ex-rental copy on VHS video - it might not be great after all this time, but would have to be better that this!  I have given it one star, as Amazon won't let me put zero which is what it deserves.

662318,5,6303486584,"Starting this movie review is difficult because I thought I would say ""This is what someone does with his Wal-Mart slip-n-fall settlement when they already own a monster truck,"" but I found out that Fred Olen Ray worked with Roger Corman.  This explains the Ed Wood-Corman-like quality - marginal, predictable script, shot fast and on the cheap with attractive females.

The story is about a young girl inheriting her grandfather's failing drive-in theater days before the bank starts foreclosing while under pressure from an unscrupulous developer to sell him the property.  She has one weekend to raise $25,000.

If you still think the girls gyrating in the hair metal band music videos were hot, this is the movie for you!  Let's relive 1988 to 1994! If you the type of guy that is looking to buy his 12 year-old son a lap dance for his 18th birthday, this is the film for you!  Just do it while mommy is getting drunk on wine at her book club meeting.

This movie has the 4th best mullet that I have seen - (1) MacGuyer, (2) Patrick Swazye in Roadhouse (greatest movie of all time), (3) the female sidekick police officer from Hunter and (4) Randy Rocket (as played by Fred Olen Rey).

This is the first movie (and most likely the only film) where I experienced a ""chubby"" (kids ask your grandmother what this means) from mom jeans and mom Daisy Dukes.  They were worn by Sarah Bellomo who, unbeknownst to me, uses the name Roxanne Blaze in porno movies.

Nikki Fritz, known for Goth erotica scenes, plays the ""awkward, nerd girl"" wearing frumpy oversized clothing until dawns her bikini exposing you to her incredibly fit (by 1990s standards) body and surgical enhancement.  Making the viewer wonder if she is really shy.  Other actresses are from adult and soft-adult films.  Ray must have told them that this was an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to work in mainstream films and show us your T, P and A.

If you can't take the overacting, listen to the commentary by Ray and Richard Gabai.",1399680000,3,2006,4.694285714285714

A young woman (Michelle Bauer) inherits a drive-in movie theater from her late grandfather.  This was the period in time that drive-ins were systemically going out of business as they had gone out of style.  That's something that would have been unheard of back in the 50s, but, it is sadly the progession of things.  {I'm not even sure whether there are any drive ins still around these days;  I remember seeing them as a kid but have not seen any in a few decades}

So, the lass tries to drum up business for the drive in < the property goes into foreclosure.  But how?  Her plan is to lure customers by having the ticket holders and concession stand workers wear bikinis.  BRILLIANT!!  Works for me every time!!

As you may expect, the film is saturated with topless women frolicking about, having fun & living life to the fullest.  Michelle Bauer is gorgeous and there are quite a few other attractive women in the film as well.  People who criticize the plotline of flicks like this seem to miss the point.  I mean, if you're looking for a deep & meaningful movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST, then go see SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Movies like this are not meant to make you think and they're always going to be lacking in depth.

662489,4,6303486584,"I received my copy earlier this week. I liked it more than I expected; unfortunately I had bought one of the pirated and cut versions off a used-DVD store and was expecting only to see the same movie plus the censored scenes. The movie is better than that.

First, ""Bikini Drive-In"" predates the collapse of the Skinemax genre around 2005 by about 10 years. You need to get your arms around that. As such, it is a glimpse into what the genre and the drive-in subculture used to be. In its era, the concept of the adult movie had a different meaning than today. A ""movie"" used to be a long-form storytelling device, and an ""adult"" comedy was a comedy that was spiced with some nudity. Some other examples are ""TunnelVision,"" ""The Groove Tube"", and Fred's ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"". Check the early movies out and you will see a vast difference from what passes for a ""movie"" today.

After the 2005 crash, an adult movie became a device for generating a group of nude scenes (AKA, simulated hardcore, or ""love"") in one long shoot. As a viewer, I have the feeling that the equivalent of the NBA's shot-clock came into effect: The format has become so rigid that it seems like the director has to get the next nude shot off before the buzzer or else he gets penalized for Delay of Game. The Shot Clock guarantees that the next ""love"" scene will start according to the clock, but the movies have gotten so predictable and flat that any chance of spontaneity is lost.

Thankfully, there's none of that in this film; instead, there must be a few dozen topless/nude scenes that are sprinkled in like fine spices and integrated into the storyline of the movie as a whole. The movie is much stronger for it. It helps define what the B-movie/drive-in subculture used to be.

This is a genuine adult comedy, not a fake hardcore. There are no phony love scenes. Thankfully, no one is required to pretend that she is in love with anyone. All of the nudity is gloriously gratuitous, presented without apology.

Second, it is a bitter reminder of how cheap the Skinemax genre has become. After they lost sight of the goal of long-form storytelling, it became easier to redefine a Skinemax shoot as just enough to get the required simulated sex scenes in. Sure, less effort is needed if that's all you want to do. It take more effort to establish characters, tell a story, and sell it.

In other ways, the movie is a homage to the lost drive-in/B-movie subculture.  Conrad Brooks, an Ed Wood groupie from the earliest days (Glen or Glenda, Plan 9) is cast as a drive-in assistant/man-Friday, just making a living in B-movies after his Ed Wood days have ended. The Mighty Monarch of Sexploitation, who ruled over softcore in the era prior to Fred, is cast as the evil real estate developer who wants to bulldoze the drive-in and build a Mega-MacGuffin. As always, he brings a comic touch to the role, establishing his character as the lovable heavy who actually wouldn't harm a fly. Check out his performance as the mobster in ""The Pick-up,"" available from Something Weird.

Back in the day, this type of movie was thought of as low budget, but by today's standards, it was extravagant. Fred has commented that he now has about two days to shoot a full-length Bikini movie on HD video and 5-6 days to shoot the season. ""Bikini Drive-In"" was shot on 35mm film by Orson Welles's cinematographer and Fred said that he spent four days shooting around the (expensive) drive-in location and another two days and a long night there. That's enough time and more than enough money to shoot a whole year's worth of today's Bikini movies. Personally I'd rather see him take the 6 days to shoot only one movie that, like this one, will earn a 20-year anniversary re-release.

One aspect of the uncut version that impressed me was how much thought and effort was put into shooting the ""big finish"" at the drive-in. Nowadays, it would have been enough to round up a bunch of nameless, faceless extras to fill out the frame in order to establish that a lot of people came to the drive-in. Not so here.

There's tons of B-movie girls who are retired but not forgotten. Nikki Fritz is cast as the ugly nerd who transforms herself into ""Miss Silicone 1994"" by slipping into a phone booth and changing into her super-identity. Any mediocre director wouldn't have even bothered with the nerd-disguise and just stuck boobs in our faces. Speaking of Boobs-in-the-Face, Becky LeBeau is in many scenes, including lap-dancing Fred Olen Ray, who was smart enough to cast himself as the lucky man (Hitchcock never thought of that move). Tane McClure appears as one of the many topless dancers and the great Michelle Bauer is cast as a B-movie star who is scheduled to put in a personal appearance on the Big Night.

The drive-in crowd puts on their own show. That's my point. Nowadays, a ""good"" movie audience is quiet and attentive, while a ""bad"" (noisy) audience plays with their cell phones or talks loudly. The B-movie drive-in audience was neither. it was participatory, perhaps like a midnight movie audience, but outdoors. The commotion they make doesn't disturb anyone because the audience is part of the show.

Besides all the top-heavy chicks, we see a guy who is dressed up in a ""Creature"" suit and we follow his little subplot. In another car, we find Forrest J Ackerman, who spent his lifetime contributing to the B-movie culture. He is involved in another little subplot. The B-directors Rolfe Kanefsky (Jacqueline Hyde & Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible man) and Donald F. Glut (of the dinosaur and mummy series) were also attracted to the big night. It goes without saying that Jim Wynorski was there to take in the view.

All in all, the missing nude scenes are all back, but they also help paint a portrait of a part of the moviegoing culture that is long gone from the American scene.",1344470400,34,5866,4.672480620155039
662490,4,6303486584,"I'm writing because a recent reviewer commented that this version is the same length as previously released edited versions.  I own a recently purchased VHS version of this movie, and previously owned a heavily edited DVD version by Miracle Productions, which I traded in for credit on a Blu-Ray purchase at a major retailer.  The Miracle Production DVD featured a large marquee on the DVD cover with the names of the major actresses.  The VHS features a model reclining on a sports car on its cover.  There is or was another DVD version with a similar cover.  I have not seen that version.

Long story short, the new DVD version of Bikine Drive-In is substantially the same as the VHS version.  Its run time is about 85 minutes, vice 86 minutes for the VHS.  I believe the difference in the running time is probably based upon the length of the legal warnings at the beginning of the film.  The new DVD version is unrated, but would probably receive an R, as would the VHS version.
The new DVD contains a commentary track by the director and an actor.  It also contains about four introductions by the director which are amusing, but repetitive.

IMHO, the picture quality is good, but not great.  The DVD cover notes that the film was mastered from the original materials; it does not say it was digitally remastered which might have improved the picture quality.  To the extent the product description suggests that the new version contains a great deal of previously censored footage, that is hype.  This version is a major improvement over the Miracle Productions DVD.  The picture quality is somewhat improved over the VHS version.",1344038400,25,1637,4.75531914893617

It's pretty much what you'd expect from Fred Olen Raye: Lots of trailer-park-style women (not top shelf in the looks department) taking off their tops--and when we're lucky, bottoms--and hopping into bed with men who they just meet.

It's also the same-old B movie plot where the big guy is torturing the little guy with an economic interest at the center--in this case, it's a drive-in movie theater.
