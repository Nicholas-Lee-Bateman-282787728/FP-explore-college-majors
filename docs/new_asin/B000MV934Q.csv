8173038,5,B000MV934Q,"I've bought other belly dance instructional videos but usually found myself bored after the second week. Amira Mor's dvd though is upbeat and fun, even though you know what she's going to say line for line. She goes through each step slowly to ensure you understand the move but the dvd in general never really goes a turtle's pace. The presentation seems a little 80s-ish and comes off low budget but you quickly learn to ignore it due to the real value you're getting, I also believe it was her first instructional video anyway. You also never feel like a complete failure because of her constant encouragement and if you pay attention to the students in the background, you'll see them making mistakes and some funny faces.",1380844800,2,726,4.724409448818897
8173039,3,B000MV934Q,"I like the DVD, but wish it could have spent more time on dancing. I like the instructions just wished had more dance routines at the end. I guess the idea was for you to get the basic and belly dance on your own!!",1370995200,,214,3.8863636363636362
8173040,5,B000MV934Q,"Love it!  Love it! Love it!  Amira Mor is very good...if you are a beginner...by all means she is the one to purchase...I have several of her DVD's and she is easy to follow...she goes slow and teaches each movement step by step...I have had other DVD's by other dancers/instructors and they move way to fast and you are ""wait what was that move you just did!!!"" and you have to stop and back up and start again...Amira Mor DVD's are a lot easier to follow and moving with her is easy....plus it is a great workout...it will make your abdomen sore...if you do it 2-3 times a week you could get your abdomen in shape in a short time.",1340841600,4,632,4.258333333333334
