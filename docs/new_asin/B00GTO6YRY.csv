8627390,3,B00GTO6YRY,"Typical mash up horror pack, it's not worth the 15-20 dollars they want on here. You can find most of these movies easily on $5.00 horror packs on here, at walmart, kmart, anywhere.
Here's the complete list, because the pictures of this set aren't super clear, and they never list the years of the films (which is important with some generic named films)
midnight's child (1992) tv movie
The Cry (2007)
Hurt (2009)
Bay Coven (1987)
The Cellar Door (2007)
The Pit and the Pendulum (1991)
Ritual: tales from the crypt (2002)
Cursed (2005)
Cruel Will (2013)
The Ray Bradbury theater: Banshee (1986 tv series)
The Ray Bradbury Theater: The small assassin (1988 tv series)
Grave Secrets : The Legacy of Hilltop Drive (1992 tv movie)
Salem Witch Trials (2002, I think it's a history channel movie)
The Haunting of Fox Hollow Farm (2011)
Haunting of Winchester House (2009) video

Most of these movies are terrible, and i mean virtually un-watchable. Somehow ""Cursed"" snuck on here, which can always add a few extra dollars to any set. I don't remember liking any other movies, there are some ""found footage"" movies on here. I got my copy for around $5.00, so i'm not too let down, but anyone paying more than 10, would probably be very upset.",1451606400,,1236,4.722222222222222
8627391,3,B00GTO6YRY,"This is another collection of recycled films. There are three discs of Echo Bridge five films. It appears they simply mix and match these discs to create different multi-packs. By ""American"" they mean American made and not that the stories take place in American. About half the films are lame made for TV offerings. It also uses two shorts from the Ray Bradbury 1985/86 HBO series as part of the ""15.""

If I was on a budget, I would pass this by for different multi-pack.

Available at Walmart stores less expensive than the Amazon offering.",1404777600,2,542,4.6947368421052635
8627392,2,B00GTO6YRY,"there are a couple of Ray Bradbury stories also a couple Tales From The Crypt tales from the television series on HBO. and some old movies that were less than stellar, its all about taste , or maybe something you wanted to see and missed but all in all rent it, if you do buy I would not pay much.",1400371200,,297,3.966666666666667
