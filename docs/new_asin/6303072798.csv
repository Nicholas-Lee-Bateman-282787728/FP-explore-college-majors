546798,3,6303072798,"Robert Taylor is the no-nonsense wagonmaster of a big ole group of women who have signed on to be the mail-order brides of a bunch of bachelor frontiersmen in California. An interesting assortment of women, some widows and some prostitutes as well as other women who for whatever reason have no prospects back east. Not so keen on Taylor, though, as to me he always seems like he's acting--I don't find him believable or immersed in his role. This movie could've been a lot better if someone else were in this role. Lots of drama for the women, as they must put up with Indian fights, deserting menfolk, floods, thirst and hunger, deaths, births, and having to move their wagons up and down harsh terrain by their own (wo)manpower. Some reviewers find it a good feminist movie, but I take exception to Taylor's rough treatment of his reformed prostitute love interest as anti-woman.",1028419200,2,882,4.771241830065359
546799,5,6303072798,"This is a rousing story starring that handsome but in this movie, unshaven and grizzled Robert Taylor leading a group of resilient pioneer women heading west to meet their future husbands for the first time.  The plot moves along briskly. The great director William Wellman shows real flair for staging exciting action sequences.  He handles a large cast of actors, horses, cattle, wagon trains, and even a cute little dog with great ease and skill.
""Westward the Women"" contains some wonderful comic moments along with occasional tragedies and much hardship along the westward trail.  The movie makes you appreciate how brave and industrious these pioneers had to be to endure the harsh weather and terrain along with occasional Indian attacks and frequent lack of provisions.
Watching ""Westward the Women"" will give you the audience a very pleasant two hours of entertainment and enlightenment about  America's westward expansion.",1021161600,9,932,5.319727891156463
546800,5,6303072798,I would recommend this movie to men and women. It displays the courage of the early frontier women trying to make a life for themselves.  The only problem with this movies is that I can not find it on DVD.  I love the colorized and the black & white versions.  Try it!,1018224000,4,268,4.115384615384615
546801,5,6303072798,Westward the Women is one of my all-time favorite films.  I love that they become so tough and overcome so many obstacles.  I cry everytime the dog in the film returns to the grave of the boy he loves.  See this movie!,1008547200,3,218,4.142857142857143
546802,4,6303072798,"Robert Taylor stars as the tough head of a wagon train of women heading West to California to marry men in need of female companionship at a new settlement.  The women are an odd assortment who prove their mettle in the face of floods, Indians, and various other obstacles.  It's an unusual premise, but director William Wellman and the story's creator Frank Capra make it memorable, along with capable performances by all the cast, especially Hope Emerson as the no-nonsence Patience.  You've got to have respect for the women and all that they faced and conquered.  The West needed a lot of strong women to help build it, and this film gives them credit.",982281600,6,656,4.728070175438597
546803,5,6303072798,"The colorized version of this American West masterpiece says volumes about the dire state of our film preservation efforts.  The computer colorizing process is remarkably effective, but it's undone by the poor quality of the  film print.  Most annoying are long and frequent stretches of the film that  momentarily go in and out of focus, likely the fault of a faulty  ""framer"" on the projector used in the transfer.  Add to that lots  of scratches and dirt throughout.  The soundtrack is mediocre at best,  unintelligible at its worst.  What a shame.  This delightful film with its  great story and great characters deserves a better presentation.  Westward  the Women deserves a proper restoration effort and a DVD presentation.",946166400,10,730,5.128205128205129

547052,5,6303072798,"I've been waiting for decades for this movie.  I first saw it nearly 50 years ago as a young teenager.  It was so different than the usual western, and showed women as more than dainty little ladies or barroom prostitutes.  I saw it once more in the 70's on TV, never forgot it.  I've been waiting so long for it to finally come out on DVD, and it has.  This is also my favorite Robert Taylor movie.  If someone is interested in more than just the standard formulaic Western, this is definitely not that!",1505260800,,504,4.308510638297872

547571,5,6303072798,"This movie has always been a favorite in my family.  We started out with the black and white recorded version on VHS and have upgraded so we can continue to enjoy it.  I love this movie because it shows you the challenges that people faced traveling West as well as the funny moments, friendships that are made, and you can see the determination people had.  There are horribly sad moments, funny moments, and moments where you feel as happy as they are.  I also liked the fact that the majority of them are women.  You see lots of westerns where people are traveling west, so this definitely puts a twist on things.  One of my favorite things about this movie is that the actors and crew actually lived out in the desert while filming the movie and were able to experience it themselves and really encompass the roles that they played.  Turner Classic Movies has a documentary about it that is really interesting to watch.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  I have loved it ever since I was a kid and it is one that my whole family likes to watch together.  I'm pretty sure I could quote the entire movie!",1480291200,,1114,4.47029702970297

547650,5,6303072798,"Robert Taylor may have had top billing but this is Hope Emersons film (playing the 6 2 Patience).  She dominates every scene shes in as the no-nonsense would-be pioneer woman out to snag a man.  The previous year she was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress in the 1950 film Caged.

The story takes place in 1851.  The men of Whitmans Valley need wives.  Roy Whitman (John McIntire) sets out to accomplish that with the reluctant aid of Buck Wyatt (Robert Taylor) who is dubious about this venture (to say the least).  But for the sake of money, he unenthusiastically takes the job of escorting 140 women west.  Through trials and hardship, some of the women make it west to marry the men anxiously awaiting their arrival.

This is an old favorite that I was happy to find was finally available for purchase (even if it is DVD-R......any port in a storm).",1470355200,5,869,4.597402597402597

The ending really delivers! I have it in the colorized version and it is the only black and white film I have seen that is actually much better in the colorized version. Robert Taylor is at his best and in his element as he escorts 150 woman westward in wagons. Who could have possibly been better suited for this role?!!!  The filming was handled in a way as to make it quite realistic from an historical point of view.  As the film proceeds, you get so attached to this group and your admiration for them grows to the point that you are invested in the superb ending when it finally arrives. There is a wonderful scene in the very middle when the ladies call out the names of women who have given their lives on the trail and it is a tribute to all who went west in our country's history. There are funny moments, tearful moments and every other type of moment as you travel with this group.

I was delighted it was finally available as a DVD.  The main reason this movie is so excellent is that it portrays women, possibly for the first time back then, as strong, capable and extremely tenacious.  In the 50's, women in movies tended to be either sexy or good housewives, with little in between.  This movie was a breakthrough for the times, and continues to be a classic.

So off they go to Chicago where they find 140 women willing to make the trip.

548865,5,6303072798,"Westward the Women (1951) is a wonderful journey of self discovery for the pioneer women making their way on the Oregon Trail to become brides.  Roy Witman (John Mc Intire)  had brought men from the east to settle a valley in Oregon.  Now that the men have their land tamed and the town built what they want now is to have a family.  To that end Witman and trail boss ""Buck"" (hunky,  Robert Taylor) head east to secure ""good"" women to become the brides.  Dannon played by Denise Darcel plays a saloon girl who with her friend Laurie want to start their lives over.  Buck has his doubts that will ever happen, but Mac Intire signs them up.  Hope Emerson is the irascible but good harted Patience,  a robust sailer widow from the northeast who lost her sons and husband at sea and is now ready to move on. Many Hollywood starlets of the day make up the rest of the brides.
 Armed with pictures of the men they have chosen for partners, the women suffer their first test when most of the hired men abandon them to face the hardships and hard work of the 6,000 mile journey through seas of grass and unending deserts.

 This movie, directed by the great William  A. Wellman, was made well before I was born but I have loved it ever since discovering it at an old time movie theater.  The movie itself is shot in glorious Technicolor, that alone enhances all the scenes. The dialog is well written with a good amount of angst between Darcel and Taylor.  The comedy in the movie comes from Hope Emerson's ""Paitence"" character - ""Oakem Smokem, I've been looking at two things this whole journey, the back of a mule and this picture, and don't ask me which ones prettier"".  Also adding some comic relief is ""Ito"" played by Henry Nakamura.  An unlikely trail hand, but Nakamura's role has him being the free, loving, comic catalyst for the wagon train.",1422489600,,1843,4.470059880239521

The story is based on a man who has settled in a California valley along with a group of other men. They farm and carry on clean lives. But one thing is missing, they have no wives. So the one man along with a wagon train master, go to Illinois, and recruit over 100 women, who too are clean women who want husbands. They then move them by wagon train to California.

I love this movie!  I ordered and received it months ago.  I was reading some of the reviews and discovered at one time it came in bw and color on same dvd or vhs.  Why in the world if this is possible would you not offer the same now?  The story in this movie is historically true and the love interest make it a beautiful romance.  I just wonder if the women of the US (including me) could ever have survived anything like this today.  What I wouldn't give if movies like this were still made today.  You don't have to worry about the language or nudity and it still is a wonderful movie! The reason I even came upon these reviews is because I was trying to find & buy the movie RACHEL AND THE STRANGER only to discover you can't buy it here.....why not?  At one time you could.  You can order it from overseas but it will not play on our equipment over here.  Why are we deprived of any of our wonderful old movies?  Please, please put this movie on dvd .

549483,5,6303072798,"I have been on both a William Wellman and a Western genre kick recently. These two converged in the film ""Westward the Women.""  The general outline of the story entails a group of women, led by Robert Taylor, making up a wagon train travelling from the Midwest to California, with the ultimate destination as a ranch where the women will become wives to the men working there. Without giving too many details of the plot away, the women, often without the assistance of the men hired to bring them west, overcome many of the trials one would associate with the landscape and period being presented.  It was a powerful, often moving film, with a conclusion worthy of a veteran filmmaker such as Wellman.  The dvd video and audio quality was good - not spectacular, but good. I own dozens and dozens of the MOD from various studios, and this is the first one I can recall that also had a feature commentary included.  The commentary was interesting without being banal or boring.  One aspect of the commentary I appreciated most was reference to the differences that would have been present in the film in they had been directed by the master of the Western genre, John Ford.",1408060800,,1173,4.647342995169082

549623,5,6303072798,"This 1951 black and white film is a good, solid western, one of the few which tell the story of one of less known but absolutely crucial aspects of the conquest of the Far West - how wives were brought to the mostly male pioniers... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film takes place in 1851 and begins in a California valley owned mostly by a cattle baron named Roy Whitman (John McIntire), a very wealthy and powerful man, who is not young anymore and as old age closes on him, aspires to leave behind something more than just a ranch and a fortune.  He wants his men to settle arounde his estate so the little valley town grows and prospers - but there is no women in this place or anywhere nearby... So he decides to invite 138 marriageable women from Chicago to travel west in order to marry his men.

Roy Whitman decides to make the travel himself and to assist him hires a skeptical, tough and unpleasant trail boss named Buck Wyatt (Robert Taylor). Women in Chicago can have a look at the pictures of the prospective mates and those who are interested, can pick a picture and sign - but only after listening to the warning, that those 2000 miles travels through merciless wilderness, roamed by hostile Indians, usually see the loss of 20% of women... Only ""good"" women are admitted - prostitutes and other saloon dancers are rejected. And then the film really begins...

This is a good film, showing surprisingly well for a 1951 movie, how HARD and DANGEROUS were those travels to the west. Accidents involving unstable wagons and unruly animals (horses, mules and oxen) were the most frequent cause of death and injury, but there were also diseases, poisonous snakes, bear attacks, poisoning by foul water and food, Indian or outlaws attacks and also internal strife, as some of those ladies came with quite a history and could (and WOULD!) use gun or knife quite well - and with all the hardships tempers were getting shorter and shorter... And then of course there was always the possibility that some escorting guards, some of which were quite unsavory characters, decide to offer themselves a kind of ""prime in kind""...

Even if Robert Taylor is the greatest star in this film, in fact he very deliberately accepted a smaller part of the time screen than one could expect - in fact this film focuses much more on women themselves. Even more surprisingly, it is not the drop dead gorgeous Fifi Danon (played by French actress Denise Darcel) who is the most important amongst them, but rather the much older Patience Hawley, played by definitely less attractive veteran actress Hope Emerson. In fact the film shows a remarkable gallery of women portraits!

There are many impressive scenes in this film, but none is better that the aftermath of Indian's attack, when the names of the fallen are cried out loud - that is something that I NEVER saw in any other western and the power of this scene is immense!

The one thing which I found really out of place is Ito (Henry Nakamura), the Japanese (!) cook who travels with the convoy. Now, granted, Ito is a great character and adds a lot to this film - but for love of God, in 1851 Japan was still a country CLOSED to the world and NO Japanese subject was EVER allowed to emigrate or even travel abroad, under pain of DEATH - and there were NO exceptions. So how did this guy found his way to America!? But OK, this is a detail - and to help me swallow this little detail, I convinced myself that maybe he simply hid on one of few Dutch ships allowed every year to trade with Japan...

I liked this film A LOT and I will absolutely keep my DVD. ENJOY!",1403481600,,3642,4.541158536585366

Being from the Midwest, I was told how hard it was for the United States to become what it is. I think this movie tells an exciting tale. It was  hard to expand west, this movie takes you along for the ride. A little hammy in places but, if a movie takes you to a place you have never been before it is a success.

550233,5,6303072798,"I will never forget the first time I saw this film. I was visiting my cousin in Redwing, MN and she had a babysitting job, so my sister and accompanied her. I was quite young and as the evening grew later, I was getting sleepy, but then... THE LATE SHOW came on... and the featured film was ""Westward the Women"".

I was instantly drawn in, as the women gathered to sign up to join a wagon train leaving for ""The West"". I was impressed by who these women were... women of all ages, sizes, ethnic backgrounds, and it made me wonder where did they come from and what would cause them to leave on such a dangerous and unknown adventure! Some of them were from other lands, and had already endured great hardships, just to arrive in America, and then to go through this! Would I have done that same thing if I was all alone in a rough and tough world, back then? Would I have signed up to travel westward on a wagon train filled with other women, to meet an unknown bridegroom at the ""end of the trail""? How scary it must have been for them, and how desperate they must have been to find a new life, or how hungry for adventure and change they must have been. The travels were uncomfortable, dirty, dangerous, painful, lonely, sometimes terrifying and tragic, but they managed somehow, without the physical strength of men to help them. This film shows the amazing strength of character and courage it took for the pioneer women to travel across the country on a wagon train journey.

As the movie continued, and I was gripped by the struggles and tragedies that besieged the wagon train of courageous women, I was fearful that my cousin's employers of the evening would walk in, and I wouldn't be able to see the end of the movie! Back then, there were no DVDs!

This film is filled with history, realistic portrayals, tragedy a little comedy, compassion, love, strength and courage. I have loved this movie from the first viewing and managed to see it a couple of times over the years on ""old movie"" channels, but I am THRILLED to have my own copy of this film to watch when ever the mood strikes. If you're like me, sometimes I just get in the mood to watch a certain favorite movie, and this is definitely one of them!

This movie is a tribute to the spirit of American Women both then and now. Finding a good husband was as difficult then as it is today but for different reasons. Everyone should be familiar with mail order brides that was necessitated out of an over population of women due to wars where the male population was decimated. If women wanted a good man for a husband, they had to be willing risk their lives to sail from the East Coast to the West Coast or as in this movie take a wagon train to a remote area in the untamed West where men had no female companionship whatsoever at the start of this movie. Either method of travel was filled with life threatening dangers in the 19th century. Most of the women who signed up for this hazardous journey were from the East Coast or immigrants from Europe and use to the civilities or genteelness of the developed East Coast or European comforts.

The challenge for these ""soft"" women passengers was that they had to gut tough quick or find themselves dying or dead from hostile Indians wanting to take their scalps, rattlesnakes, lack of water in a hot dessert and flash floods all lethal elements in a hostile environment. The story stars Robert Taylor a rugged Wagon Master whose job was to get as many of the women in his charge back to the remote settlement in the rugged wilderness of the West. This band of sisters all rookies had to learn and do things quickly that an experienced pioneer woman would find challenging. The women fought all these hostile elements valiantly but a few were killed by Indians.

Robert Taylor finally makes it back to the eagerly waiting men. Since the women made the sacrifice of the hazardous journey risking their lives, they got to choose their husbands from the collective group of men. A Parson was nearby and they all got on line to get hitched. Robert Taylor found himself heading to get on the end of that line with a hate/love relationship that ended in love.  Great movie, great action and romance at the end of the trail which is now Home Sweet Home for Westward the Women. Don't miss it.
Hope this helps.  Blessings.  Phil",1365206400,2,2195,4.558375634517766

551155,5,6303072798,"Based on a true story, this wagon train saga details a 2000 mile journey from Chicago to California. Scout Robert Taylor is in charge, but the ladies are as tough-minded as he is. They'd better be, they're heading straight into an ambush.
Fanny Kelly survived a wagon train ambush. Her narrative ""My Captivity Among the Sioux"" (Longmeadow Press) is a fascinating account of her experiences with ""a people who had none of the kindlier feelings of humanity."" Which was how the struggling Sioux viewed her people for forcing them onto reservations where they could neither hunt nor grow food.
Said Sitting Bull: ""Empty stomachs grumble loudly. If food and other provisions are not there for them, the Indians will take what they want.""
Sitting Bull and 3000 Sioux crossed into Canada's Northwest territories to get help from the Blackfeet. Army General Alfred Terry, the man who sicked Custer on the Sioux, went after Sitting Bull to get him to return. He did return, but according to Buffalo Bill, ""could not be weened from his desire to avenge the wrongs inflicted upon his people. He fought to preserve their land, their way of life, their culture, but by 1890 saw everything he fought to preserve disappear.""
By 1890, the cowboy saw everything he fought to preserve disappear, like open country where he could ride his pony as far as his pony could go in any direction. It wasn't there for him anymore.",1357862400,,1403,4.825726141078838

...If they remade the film today, the lead would be played by some young guy with fab hair who got his start in vampire movies.  Stunt crew would do everything that the cast had to do for themselves the first time around.  Unflattering costumes would of course be replaced with something more feminine...

...Complexions would be perfect, and dozens of blow dryers would be handy.  The film would be backed by the same people who cast Valerie Bertinelli  as Pancho Barnes... (one of the most courageous and homely women on the planet...)

But the trail boss is not happy. As he puts it, ""There's only two things that scare me and a good woman is both of them.""

551405,5,6303072798,"This film really redefines the concepts of Womanhood, Femininity and ""The Fairer Sex""!! These women demonstrate an example of will, determination, courage and resolve that many men don't have the backbone to exhibit. The things that make a woman desirable to an honorable man have always been more than mere physical attributes. Women desire and deserve to be honored for the content of their character. If a woman struts down the street with a wardrobe selection that puts her 38-28-38 physique on grand display, she will turn heads faster than a tornado turns a windmill; but if that very same woman falls in love, the needs of her heart become the God that sends the tornado and the architect who designed the windmill. Westward The Women gives you everything a woman can be without losing the 'Garden of Eden' essence of everything a woman wants to be. I am a man whose belief in the power and goodness of God begins and ends with the look in a woman's eyes, the touch of her hand and the soft warmth of her embrace. This film makes these three, Faith, Hope and Love a prelude to the meaning and longing of all we dream that life should be; and the greatest of these is Love.",1337385600,16,1179,4.539906103286385
551406,5,6303072798,"DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, guys---""Westward the Women"" is as intense and harrowing as any film from Hollywood's Golden Age, and is so well written, directed and photographed, that you feel as if you are a part of this rugged, dangerous journey, especially after the brutal, unyielding (and very reluctant) Robert Taylor ends up driving off the men who have signed on to guard the wagon train, leaving the women alone with him to face the elements, the terrain, AND the maruading Indian tribes.

But these are no ordinary, stereotypical Hollywood women, and I predict that anyone who appreciates great film-making will find themslves entirely engrossed in their story....a story, incidentally, written by none other than FRANK CAPRA. So you can be sure that the HUMANITY quotient is very high indeed in this intimate yet epic drama.

My only reservation is the obligatory romantic subplot between Robert Taylor and Denise Darcel, which occasionally distracts from the main story. And, yes, the comic relief scenes with Ito, the Japanese cook, do get a bit tiresome. But the vast majority of the film is a powerful testament to the courage and endurance of 19th-Century American women, with actress Hope Emerson---against all expectations--practically STEALING THE SHOW as the emotional ""fortress"" and Mother Earth figure of the intrepid band.

Other than the lovely opening and closing musical theme (sung by a female chorus which still, in 1951, maintains that classic ""heavenly"" sound from Hollywood's Golden Age), there is NO MUSIC in the film, until the action specifically requires it in the final scene----and what a scene it is.  I swear....when that little dance orchestra goes into ""Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes"", I have to fight back the tears, every time. I wish that we would see a bit more of these wonderful ladies that we have to come to love and admire during this final scene (and a little LESS of the star romantic couple) but, again, it's a minor quibble.

A first-rate film experience, now (finally) available on DVD.

I just love the ending, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, by telling about it.  The characters are very well done and you find yourself rooting for the different women, many of whom are looking for a new life.  Two are prostitutes, one is pregnant and unwed, there are several widows (including one whose husband was a sailor and she's one of the best characters in the movie), and others who are going for other reasons, but more than anything, they're gutsy and smart.  One woman takes her little boy and he takes his little dog and they're both so cute, they'll make you cry.  The man leading the wagon train tells the men that are waiting to pick brides that they went through hell to get there, and they surely did.

551507,5,6303072798,"Recalling this movie from my childhood, I searched about a year until I found this DVD. Bought a new machine that plays region 2 DVDs expressly to be able to watch this disk. Am thrilled to have the chance to see the movie now whenever I want to. The DVD was produced in France and plays versions in both French and the original English; the menu button doesn't hold the English version from viewing to viewing, so I usually have to adjust it each time. BUT IT'S WORTH IT. I hope fervently amazon.com can find a region 1 version to offer folks who aren't as avid as I decided to be in buying a special playing machine. There's no reason at all why ""Westward the Women"" should not be a popular film. The cast of some 140 women is strong, memorable, and lovely. Before filming began, they practiced in the California foothills for months, learning to shoot, drive mules, deal with rattle snakes and desert sand and storms, pull the heavy wagons up and down steep, rocky grades by themselves. How dedicated they were and how successful at making an excellent story that keeps your attention from first to last deserves to be seen as often as any John Wayne vehicle. Hope Emerson pulls off her role with wit and humor and upstanding common sense. Don't be fooled by her nasty prison warden role in ""Caged"": she played in many other movies, winning awards, as a character actor. Here she's a primary player, along with Robert Taylor and Denise Darcel, whose romance is made secondary to the primary story of the women but is touching nonetheless. John McIntire as rancher Roy Whitman, bringing the women west to populate his ranchland, and Henry Nakamura as Ito, a superb foil for Taylor's dedication as wagonmaster, deserve to be remembered and seen. The scenes that bring the story to a close, when the women and men they will soon marry first meet, are at once funny and tender. There is no more real depiction of how the west was won--through the losses endured and sustained resilience of women (and men) like these. It's testimony to Hollywood's ability to turn out a hit that I was able to recall this great film, having seen it only once before, when I was 10, some 60 years ago.

The story tells of the horrible hardships, sickness and death, that these women endured, just to get to their destination on the wagon train. The necessity of having to do ""men's jobs"" along the way, toughened up these brave ladies.

I loved the movie, and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the hardships that women and men faced, in order to settle our beautiful country.",1231286400,,666,4.635593220338983

Most history books and movies make women of that era look like a bunch of pansies!  Westward the Women depict women in a true pioneer light, able to do what is considered the work of men.  This movie spurred on my interest in women's histories.  This should be part of any school pioneer studies.

551669,4,6303072798,"Robert Taylor -a prominent male star of its era -gets top billing in this exceptional Western but it it among the small number of genre movies that focuses primarily on women and their role in opening up the West .

It is blessed by having the experienced genre hand William Wellman in the director's chair and also by being able to call on the services of cinematographer William Mellor whose striking monochrome photography shows the rugged landscape to great advantage

It is 1851 and rugged Californian rancher Roy Whitman -played well by John McIntire -hires trail guide Buck Wyatt ( Robert Taylor )to guide a troop of 150 women from Chicago to his ranch to provide brides for his lonely cowhands and other residents of the area .The women who sign up for the venture are a cross section of society ;there is a a robust Massachusetts woman ,the widow of a deep sea fisherman ; a schoolteacher ;an Italian widow and her nine year old son ; a pregnant single woman ;and the main heroine of the movie A Frenchwoman of dubious past Fifi Danon ( Denise Dax ).These -along with many others embark on the perilous journey .Trouble flares with some of the men hired to accompany the party and Tylor does not scruple to enforce his rules reagarding his men who fraternise with the women -death .Most of the crew leave Taylor and the women to go it alone .This is where the movie shifts gear into a tale of a group of outsiders banding together to overcome great odds and the many perils of the trail-Indians , hauling waagons over mountains ,quicksand ,storms and freak accidents .It is greatly helped by having a cast of women who look capable of achieving these odds rather than a colection of people who would appear lost if they were out of sight of the beauty salon

Taylor is good as the misogynistic Wyatt who comes to moderate his views on his charges -"" There are only two things that scare me and a good woman is both of them "" is a key line from the early part of the picture and  is spoken by Wyatt .He comes to regard his charges as great women and demand the waiting men to be worthy of them

It is useful to set this along side the best known wagon train movie  John Ford's Wagonmaster which set out to achieve a mythic and archetypal quality ,right down to its self consciously mythologising main title song .The Wellman movie is a great deal more specific in its focus on one particular group and is a worthy tribute to the pioneer women , a group whose role in Western expansion has not received its due from the movie industry",1102550400,45,2541,4.453763440860215
551670,4,6303072798,"As a fan of the more ""rough-and-tumbleweed"" John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns, I am almost embarressed to admit that I really like this movie with wall-to-wall women. Most of the reviewers here have focused on the feminist empowerment aspects of this movie, but actually it is an enjoyable film even if your idea of a strong woman is a wife that takes out the trash. (Coincidentally, one of the actresses resembles Bella Abzug.) With a strong story, interesting visuals and enough ""women-in-distress"" scenes to keep any man interested, this admittedly unusual movie should not be pidgeon-holed as a niche market film.",1091232000,5,622,5.107843137254902
551671,5,6303072798,"This film depicts a classic westward journey. Not the usual family voyage, but single women yearning for home and family in a California valley. Their journey begins with the women, the train boss (Robert Taylor), and the men whose work it is to help get the wagon train and the women to their destination. One night, however, all but 4 of the men desert the train. The next morning, the boss decides to ""make men out of the women"", so they can complete the trip. The struggles, heartaches, and accomplishments of these women are lived out in their quest.  The realism of this story is compelling. You, the viewer, will want to revisit this movie often and share it with your family and friends who admire bravery and strength when it shows up in ordinary people.",1061337600,9,763,4.610294117647059
