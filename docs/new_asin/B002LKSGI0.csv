8465688,4,B002LKSGI0,"I purchase this video based on the review that mentioned the song Cowgirl in the Sand and now after purchasing this video I am wondering why it was mentioned since it is not in this film.

~ UPDATE: THE SURF FILM WITH THE LONG VERSION OF THE SONG COWGIRL IN THE SAND BY NEIL YOUNG IS ""SEA DREAMS"" BY PETER FRENCH and CURT MASTALKA available from Pippi's Surf Shop, who I thank very much for the info. ~

I lived on Oahu for 5 years back in the early to mid 70's and frequented the Haleiwa Theater on the North Shore to see the latest surf flicks. Of all the movies I saw there only one had a scene that has stood out in my mind for almost 40 years. The scene had a surfer surfing to the jam sections of the song Cowgirl in the Sand by Neil Young, during the chorus there was a girl walking on the beach, this footage is definitely not in this film. I called and left a message at Pippi's Surfshop to see if someone can possibly tell me which movie this footage may be from. If they can tell me I will update this review if possible since the almighty Google cannot provide the Cowgirl in the Sand answer and it has been asked more than once.

Otherwise this film has some great surf footage in it, wish the sound quality was a little better. The ""Rocket Men"", surfers with camera clad helmets, do a great job of showing what it was like to be out there on the waves in a time and place that only film and memories can visit.",1345075200,,1424,4.078571428571428
8465689,5,B002LKSGI0,"Great footage, Mastalka was the underground photographer of his era, maybe of all-time. He knew film, and he knew the surfers. And the music was even better - Cowgirl in the Sand, etc. Reviewer forgot to mention Rory Russell, Booby Jones, Edward McQuilken (RIP) and Ricky Cassiday, all Rocketman.",1320192000,,296,5.061224489795919
