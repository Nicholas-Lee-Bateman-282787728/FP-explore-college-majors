8279244,2,B001ARJDVO,"I seriously wanted visual material for my students to use for their Colonial Williamsburg unit and was desperate for material.

When I saw this DVD, I thought my prayers were answered.  Not quite.....

I found the presentation to be rather slow which did not fair well with my students.  They lost interest way too easily.  There is a 180 page PDF file attached to a CD rom which comes in handy to a certain extent.  There is no differentiated instruction, nothing for slow learners and ESL students.  The content was way too advanced for my 5th graders.  I needed to create a video watching guide in order for the students to stay focused on the DVD.

This DVD is not suitable enough for 5th graders.  I would think high-level 6-8 grade students would benefit from this DVD.

It is certainly not worth the staggering $100.00 I paid for it.  I would have felt better if it was 1/2 price.  I took the chance---crashed and burned.

Please do not waste your money!",1363996800,6,961,4.543859649122807
