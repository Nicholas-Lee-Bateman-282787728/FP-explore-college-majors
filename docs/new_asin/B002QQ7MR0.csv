3967620,5,B002QQ7MR0,The revelations on Enigma since the 70s have cast a light on a piece of history too long kept in the shadow of secrecy.  This film is informative for beginners and those who have spent years studying the subject.  An excellent effort.,1364688000,6,234,4.5476190476190474

3967622,5,B002QQ7MR0,"I've always thought the breaking of the Enigma code was super-human, and this documentary goes into great detail about the men and women who did the impossible, and changed the outcome of the war.

3967623,4,B002QQ7MR0,"It is just not possible to give a full account of WW2 Allied cryptology in one 140 minutes documentary.  This version leaves out altogether the breaking of the German encrypted teleprinter used for high level communications.  Thus the role of signals intelligence in checking that the Fortitude deception operations designed to conceal the the coming invasion of Normandy had in fact succeeded is passed over.  But this omission leaves space to describe the Battle of the Atlantic in some detail.  Churchill had said that the one thing that really scared him in the war was the attack by submarines on the shipping needed to keep Britain going.  The documentary does find space for much about the breaking of the various Enigma systems.  But again something else has to go, and it is about another submarine blockade, this time of Japan by American submarines.  Some serious misapprehensions about the attack on the principal operational cipher systems of the Japanese Navy are passed on.  In particular the role of the British in breaking into JN-25A in 1939-1940 and JN-25B in 1941-1942 do not get a mention.  The technical work by the production crew seems first class.

3967634,4,B002QQ7MR0,"I watched this as Prime streaming video.

Overall audio/video quality was OK with the understanding that this was produced in 2001 (possibly earlier) and uses archived footage from 1910 (or so) through 1945.  Accordingly, the source material is of lower quality than what younger generations have experienced.

This really is two videos rolled into one, The Rise of Enigma and Triumph of the Code Breakers that were original part of a two DVD set and probably was a four episode TV broadcast although I am not sure of the last.

Other than the sections on Enigma there really wasn't much information on how the codes were actually broken and therefore was more of how the information was used with some code-breaking information dispersed.  Since this is a British production there were some relatively minor errors in telling the American side in the Pacific but, contrary to so many other British WWII videos, gives adequate credit to the non-British participants such as the Poles and Americans.  There also was slight annoyance with the timeline when the video got up to the Battle of Britain and then interspersed information about American participation on the Enigma side, Magic or the Japanese diplomatic codes also called Purple, then after showing video about the Pearl Harbor attack went back to the Battle of Britain with a line similar to At the same time.  Perhaps my understanding of history is wrong but the Battle of Britain was primarily in the summer and fall of 1940 whereas Pearl Harbor was December 7, 1941 although the U.S. had broken the Japanese diplomatic codes in September 1940 (approximately).

The backstory information going back to WWI and the Washington Naval Arms Limitation Conference of 1921 to 1922 and The Black Chamber was a great addition.

If one is interested in WWII this (or these) videos are well worth the nearly 2.5 hours.",1453593600,,1869,4.964743589743589

3967641,5,B002QQ7MR0,"EDUCATION BASED / NOT FLASHY

This is an amazing documentary. It's very long, and very detailed. It is not Hollywood glamor. It's made to educate.

As such, this is probably not right for someone who's not previously interested in WWII or how codes and technology impact warfare. The viewer in mind when this was made was someone who already held interest in those topics.

It jumps right into the education in the first minute of the film. There's no lead in or dramatic scenes with actors. It's all talking about improvements in technology and coded messages.

It's not a complete history of codes and code breaking in WWII, but it can't be in 2.5 hours. Codes and code breaking was an ever evolving subject for the entire war from 1938 to 1945 and it functioned differently in each theater of the war. You'd need a documentary a month long to tell you everything there was to know about WWII code technology. This documentary focuses on some specific areas of codes, code breaking, and other discussions about technology.

If you don't have a long attention span, this is absolutely not for you. If you are interested in history and WWII and can focus on a single subject for more than an hour, this is fascinating. (I'll also point out that it's easy to stop this and restart it later. I watched it in 2 sittings of an hour and an hour and 20 minutes.

3967680,5,B002QQ7MR0,"Remarkable naval archive footage of World War II. This program outlines Hilter's take-over of Europe, and also the defeat of the Japanese at sea. Fantastic war footage!! Both Hitler and the Japanese were defeated primarily by the use of 'code breakers' both in America and England.

After Pearl Harbor, the American code breaking focus shifted from Japanese diplomatic codes to Japanese naval codes. The war in the Pacific was conducted over a huge ocean area, and the Japanese and American fleets were the most important players in that conflict. The US Navy needed to obtain intelligence on Japanese fleet strength, dispositions, and intentions.

US Navy code breakers did not make real progress until January 1942. They were too late to defeat the attack on Pearl Harbor, but they would provide significant help to allow America put a stop to Japan's six-month rampage across the Pacific.  US Navy code breakers did not make real progress on JN-25 until January 1942. They were too late to defeat the attack on Pearl Harbor, but they would provide significant help to allow America put a stop to Japan's six-month rampage across the Pacific.

The most significant US Navy group in the effort to crack JN-25 was the ""Combat Intelligence Unit"" in the basement of the 14th Naval District Administration Building at Pearl Harbor, under the command of Commodore John Rochefort. Rochefort was a workaholic who had lived in Japan and was fluent in Japanese. His people worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, while Rochefort monitored and prodded their progress. He rarely emerged from the basement, falling onto a cot when he absolutely had to have some sleep.

The Rochefort group had managed to analyze the patterns in documents encoded in JN-25 through exhaustive mathematical analysis. They were able to perform some of the analysis with automatic punch-card tabulating machines, an approach that had been pioneered by Lieutenant Commander Thomas H. Dyer, one of the staff in Rochefort's group.

Cracking JN-25 required two steps, the first being to crack the cipher scheme, the second being to figure out the underlying code values. The fact that the Japanese couldn't replace their code books more often than once every several months meant that cipher sequences were often reused. Eventually, the Rochefort group was able to build up their own cipher table, and if one crib could be identified in a message, it could be used to index into the Americans' reverse-engineered cipher table, allowing decipherment of the rest of the message.

Once the cryptanalysts were able to strip away the cipher scheme that hid the code values, they then began to build up a dictionary of the code values from context and hints. For example, signals intercept combined with radio direction finding often allowed messages to be linked to the specific ships that sent them. Another hint was that different Japanese telegraphers often had distinct ""keying"" styles that allowed signals intercept technicians to identify them. It was said of one Japanese telegrapher on the carrier AKAGI that ""he hits the key like he's kicking it with his foot.""

On May 8th, British and American forces attacked the Japanese warship, Shoho, they used 82 bombers in the raid and sunk the Japanese ship. The code breaking system was working....

While US code breakers were working against Japanese codes and ciphers, the British, leveraging techniques developed by Polish code breakers, made their own remarkable penetrations of German ciphers at the British code breaking establishment at Bletchley Park.

The German military had put Arthur Scherbius's Enigma cipher machine into use. The British, the French, and the Americans all tried to crack Enigma, and they all failed, partly because they did not try very hard. Germany was at the time generally disarmed, in disarray, and not much of a threat, and after the terrible bloodletting of the Great War nobody thought anyone would be crazy enough to want to start a serious war any time soon. There was no pressure to crack a difficult cipher as Enigma.

The Poles were not so complacent. Poland was now independent after a long period of division between Russia and Germany. The Poles wanted to remain independent, while both the Germans and the Russians wanted to regain their lost Polish territories. The Poles established the ""Biuro Szyfrow (Cipher Bureau)"", to provide intelligence on their enemies. The Biuro Szyfrow proved its worth in the Russo-Polish War in 1919:1920, when it provided valuable intelligence that helped defeat the Soviet invasion of Poland.

When the Biuro Szyfrow encountered Enigma in 1926, Polish codebreakers were just as baffled as everyone else. A Captain Maksimilian Ciezki was in charge of deciphering German messages. He knew about the Enigma machine and in fact had access to a commercial version of it, but that did him only a small amount of good. The rotors of the military version were wired differently, and even if the rotor wiring was known, there was still the difficult problem of determining the daykey that defined the daily Enigma configuration. Ciezki made no progress on Enigma until 1931, when simple luck handed him the solution to a good part of the problem.

* Hans-Thilo Schmidt was then a 43-year-old employee of the German ""Chiffrierstelle"", which administered German enciphered communications. He was also embittered from a number of reverses of fortune and in need of money, a bad combination for someone in a sensitive position. In 1931, Schmidt contacted French intelligence and arranged a very profitable sale of information about the Enigma.

The documents provided the rules for using an Enigma machine and gave hints that could help determine the rotor scramblings, though they did not define the wiring between the keyboard and the first rotor. Schmidt's documents were a major step towards overcoming the first obstacle for deciphering Enigma messages, but French did little with the intelligence themselves. However, the French had an agreement with the Poles for sharing such intelligence, and passed the documents provided by Schmidt on to the Biuro Szyfrow. Captain Ciezki now had half of a grip on Enigma.

The Biuro had recruited a number of mathematicians from the university at Poznan to help them crack Enigma. Poznan had been part of Germany before the reconstruction of Poland, and these mathematicians were all fluent in German. Recruiting mathematicians was an innovative step on the part of the Poles. Traditionally, linguists had been regarded as the best candidates for code breakers, but now the field had become more technical, and a technical mind was regarded as possibly better suited to the job.

The star among this group was a quiet 23-year-old named Marian Rejewski. He had been studying statistics and intended to work in the insurance industry. Had he done so, he would likely never have made much of a mark on the world. Instead, he earned himself a place in the history books, of cryptology at least, and helped change the course of the coming war.

Rejewski was assigned to work on Enigma. The first problem was to determine the wiring arrangement of the Enigma machine. Rejewski figured out the wiring of the rotors using some mathematical logic and clues provided by Schmidt, and then the wiring between the keyboard and the first rotor of the military Enigma machine. He thought the matter over for some time, and then made an assumption: what if the Germans hadn't bothered to scramble the wiring at all? That it was in straight A-B-C-D order? That turned out to be the case. Sometimes the obvious and stupid answer is the right one.

And the rest is history, as they say..... Watch this program. It is absolutely fascinating and informative. Code Breakers were real heroes who went without much recognition, but now the world is beginning to realize the immense and important effort they contributed to winning World War II on ground and at sea. We will never forget them, and this program is a tribute to their courage and wisdom. Thank you, code breakers........",1378857600,12,8088,5.077560240963855

3967686,4,B002QQ7MR0,"An excellent exposition of how the Allies cracked German codes and coding machines like Enigma. I was surprised by the fact that this was a 50-year process spanning both World Wars. The documentary portrays code-cracking as the intersection of art and science, and I was also fascinated by how it prompted developments in the then-nascent realms of statistics and computer technology.",1366761600,,384,5.311475409836065

8377866,5,B002QQ7MR0,"The first thing to point out is that this film originates from an early 90s UK television documentary series. Some episodes are patched together without intermediate title sequence or credits which leads to narrative jumps and overlaps. Given the age of the film, don't expect to see fancy special effects or redramatizations of actual events common in modern documentaries. At one point narrator and writer William Woollard pushes about some metal toy battleships on a map of the North Sea to illustrate the Battle of Jutland. Nothing fancy, but it works. The great advantage it has is that it was filmed at a time when many of the protagonists from the WW2 era were still alive. We hear for example from the great Frank B Rowlett, founder alongside William Friedman of the NSA. Shaun Wylie who worked alongside Alan Turing in Hut 8 at Bletchley Park is also interviewed. A lady who operated the 4 wheel Enigma bombes in Washington in her youth shows how the machine as set up and run. Cryptography historian and expert David Kahn chips in with insights. Some of the contemporary footage is very interesting, for example, there is a sequence showing an Enigma machine being used in the field. John Ford's film of the Japanese air attack on Midway gets prominent placement -- watching it you get a feel for what it was like on the island under aerial bombardment that no Hollywood CGI sequence can match. The historical footage is well chosen and dramatic. Overall this is essential viewing for anyone interested in the history of cryptology.",1522627200,,1542,4.84469696969697
