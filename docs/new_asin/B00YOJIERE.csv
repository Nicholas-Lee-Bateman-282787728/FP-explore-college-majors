7223236,1,B00YOJIERE,"After fast forwarding through pointless dialogue from the very beginning I came to realize I msy as well fast forward the whole movie. Everything about it was pointless, slow and in no way shape or form was this a scary movie. A 5 yr old wouldn't even be scared by this flick. Don't waste your time or money. I turned it off after 15 minutes!",1442880000,,342,4.276923076923077
7223237,1,B00YOJIERE,"Horrible movie, waste of money, watched 30 minutes of it and nothing happened, not a horror, should never of even been made.",1442534400,,124,4.681818181818182
7223238,1,B00YOJIERE,"If I could give it less then one star I would. It is not a horror movie, it is not a suspensful movie. It is an awful movie. The acting is bad, the caretaker seems to be doing a bad Sean Connery/ evil sea captain impression through out the movie. You know where the movie is going from the first scene and that is right where you end up. I watch a lot of horror and suspense so I can take campy, I can take a plot that goes no where, but even I draw the line at a movie that has no point what so ever.",1442275200,3,501,3.691588785046729

7223240,1,B00YOJIERE,"After watching this, I come to a conclusion that the title of the movie should be changed.  This story really had only 5 min of ghost and the rest of it was just a wife cheating on her husband.  If you are looking for a good and scary ghost story, by all means pass this one up.  You will be disappointed.",1441929600,7,305,3.9672131147540983
8718645,4,B00YOJIERE,"I totally disagree with the naysayers on this film.
When a pic comes along and isn't your boring, predictable, know all the actors, plots that have been done a hundred times over and straight out of a Hollywood revamped set.... Well i'm on it for it being different!! The musical score is A plus. The camera work is phenomenal. Layers and layers of shadow, gritiness, color extremes and mutes. I found this mix very refreshing. I recommend. No doubt about it!",1481500800,,459,4.679012345679013
8718646,1,B00YOJIERE,"Words cannot describe how truly awful this movie is. Handsome handyman moves into house with bored, frustrated housewife and inattentive husband. Later, there is a haunting. This was just bad, really, really bad.",1452556800,,212,5.454545454545454

8718648,1,B00YOJIERE,"If I could give it a negative star review, I would.  This movie sucks butts. This movie isn't even bad enough to be funny.",1446249600,,122,4.083333333333333

8718651,2,B00YOJIERE,"I rented this movie because I previously rented Poltergeist Activity and thought it was a decent enough film. I could have done without the ""ghosts"" wearing bad doll masks and robes, but I liked Lee Bane's character and acting in that film. He is the reason I decided to rent Haunting at the Rectory, but as other reviewers have said, this is definitely NOT a horror movie. I thought the story, as a concept, had potential. Sadly, it was ruined either by poor writing or poor acting, if not both, and I found two of the three primary characters to be one-dimensional and unlikable. The only character that seemed ""real"" to me, with any sort of depth and ability to garner sympathy, was Lionel. The reason I choose to give the film two stars is because -- SPOILER ALERT, if anyone cares -- I was glad for Lionel when the others were finally out of the picture. (No pun intended.) Too bad it took so long for that to happen. If this was the emotional/psychological effect the writer intended for the audience all along, then kudos and I'll increase the star rating. Otherwise, the plot remains for me one that could have gone further or been portrayed better. If you are looking for a good, edge-of-your-seat, scary movie.... this is not the film for you.",1444348800,2,1253,4.573333333333333
8718652,1,B00YOJIERE,I made the mistake of renting this and I couldn't finish it.  What dialogue there was in this sad excuse was poorly acted.  Waste of time.,1444348800,,138,4.269230769230769
8718653,1,B00YOJIERE,"Terrible acting. Ridiculous characters. I always find something redeeming in every movie that I buy, but this is the second DVD that I have thrown away.",1443571200,,152,4.884615384615385
8718654,1,B00YOJIERE,"5 minutes into this movie, there was a woman with her breasts hanging out trying to get some action. I'm not impressed. We rented it because we like scary movies. I couldn't tell you if it is scary. We turned it off. Stupid. Don't waste your money. I am angry that I wasted a free rental on this trash.",1443225600,,302,4.135593220338983
