7949033,5,B00005OSJY,"This is possibly the best Slideshow'of the Australian Outback. Michael Scott-Lees who shot the photo's in wideframe without filters is to be congratulated for his fine work. The panning of these photo's are professionaly done and the music is certainly appropriate. Have not got my copy from Amazon as yet but can review as have seen a preview 3 days ago. NOT TO BE MISSED AND CAN BE OBTAINED AT AMAZON FOR A REASONABLE PRICE.

7949036,1,B00005OSJY,"This is a slide show presentation of some pictures of Australia - the Outback is a misnomer as the rainforest in Queensland is included along with a number of ocean beach pictures.  The Outback is the outback NOT the coast line of Australa or the tropical Rain Forest.

None of the pictures are labeled so you have absolutely no idea where they were taken and the slide show is accompanied by some ecletic music which is a further distraction.

I would give it zero stars if I could.  This slide show would be much better presented in a book - not sitting in front of a TV with the camera zooming in or out on the same still picture and then going to the next one.

I have been to Australia and am familiar with the Alice Springs area and the tropical rainforst in Queensland as well as many other locations in this beautiful country. This is not the way to see Australia. There are many excellent books with photographs at least as good (if not better) than those shown here and you can turn the pages at will staying on one picture as long as you want. In a book they tell you where the picture was taken - no idea while viewing this slide show and I found nothing in the enclosed material that gave you that information.

A total and complete disappointment.

7949037,2,B00005OSJY,"The photos are beautiful, but they're stills, not video footage. That gives this DVD the feel of a coffee table book set to music. The music is moving and appropriately spiritual, but the experience feels bounded by the photo frames. I didn't get a feel of the real Outback - more a glossy set of postcards. As a homesick Australian, I was disappointed.",1012348800,13,353,4.619047619047619
