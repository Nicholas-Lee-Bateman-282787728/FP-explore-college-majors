8320392,1,B001M3X5HO,"I ordered the complete 3 DVD set of this title, but only received Part 2 in the package.  It has some good footage, but not nearly as exciting or insightful as I had hoped.  It is what I'd call a low-end production with home made looking titles and poor sound.  Amazon was good enough to refund me for the two DVDs that were not included in the order, but I don't intend to re-order them as I don't expect the quality to be any better than #2.",1360540800,2,443,4.068965517241379
