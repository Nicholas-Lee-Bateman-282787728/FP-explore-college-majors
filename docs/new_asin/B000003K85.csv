7902906,2,B000003K85,"Starfleet is trying to get some information out of the Karemma, the same race that helped direct the Defiant to the Dominion communications relay in  The Search (Part 1). The Jem'hadar get wind of this and are not impressed,  attempting to destroy both the Karemma vessel and the Defiant. With the  ship crippled, Sisko calls for them to head into the unstable atmosphere of  a gas giant. Once in there they need to come up with a way to get home, all  the while three meanacing Jem'hadar fighters are searching the gaseous  atmosphere. The major characters get divided in the most hilarious  circumstances that should've been serious but looked slapstick and totally  scientifically inaccurate. Thinking that they're all going to die 'secrets'  are revealed in the heat of the moment, nothing shocking, nothing exciting,  add to that one of those ""the Captain's going to die unless we get  back in 40 minutes"" stories and you have a melodramatic predictable  episode.",966729600,,968,4.98125
