8339891,4,B001SJ56T2,"We have had this DVD for awhile now (1.5 - 2 years).  For the money ($10), I felt it was a very good value.  It presents basic concepts of currency, coin history and materials, coin recognition, coin size not reflective of a coin's value, overall value awareness and combinations of change for equivalence, counting cents by 1's, 5's, 10's, 25's and 50's to a 100 cents, or 1 dollar, and counting mixed change.  It does use images of real money which presents the coins with 100% accuracy.  They have a couple ways that they present the learning in the video.  First, it starts with a graphical animated approach with music.  In the later part, they use puppet interaction where the puppet wizard Cha-Ching counts coins beyond $1, and teaches about coin money and money value to other puppets.

It is a very good compliment to Rock 'n Learns Money DVD, and Munchkin Math Money DVDs.  I would say that it falls right in the middle of the two.  So, Munchkin Math Money DVD is for the youngest children.  Next, this DVD is good for slightly older children.  For the oldest children, rock 'n Learn may be best.  Our highly advanced Kindergartner prefers the Rock 'n Learn DVD now, but I believe that this Money Matter$ DVD made for a better option when he was younger.  If you have a young child (3,4, or 5) that is ready to learn about money, then this may be an excellent resource for teaching that child all about money matters.  For older children, the Rock 'n Learn's DVD might be a better choice.",1327795200,2,1498,4.520446096654275
