7989636,5,B0000950YI,"Wally Armstrong joined the PGA tour in 1973 and played for 12 years.  He has made a second career in teaching golf and has made many simple golf training aids.

This 2 DVD set is a compilation of videos that were initially created in the days of VHS video cassettes.  At the price, I was a little hesitant about getting an instructional video that comprised approximately 7 hours for this price.

Many aspects of golf are covered, from fundamentals, driver's education, long game and short game drills, the mental game, putting, chipping, sand play, golf myths and misconceptions.  He even uses items that are in your home and practical imagery in helping you get a feel for the swing and technique.  His teaching is practical and less technical.

This is a no nonsense approach to learning many aspects of this complex game.  For the price, there is no better value in video golf instruction.",1163808000,5,893,4.753246753246753
