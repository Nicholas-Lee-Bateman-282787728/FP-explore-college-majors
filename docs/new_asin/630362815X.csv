Very informative and totally enjoyable!!!!

Nice addition to your dvd or vhs library :)",1190246400,3,157,4.607142857142857
705555,4,630362815X,My children were coming to the age where they did not believe in Santa as a live person who comes down your chimmeney. They had a lot of questions about how he got to be the icon that he is and what exactly he had to do with Christmas a very religious holiday. This explains alot of who the real Santa Claus was and how he got to be so commercialized. Good for some children and all adults.,1133136000,10,390,4.012820512820513
705556,5,630362815X,This is by far the best history of Santa Claus I have seen (and I've searched them all out). A respectful treatment of the religious tradition of St. Nick and a very extensive history to the modern legend of Santa Claus. I can not recommend this video more highly,976579200,16,263,4.387755102040816
705706,2,630362815X,"I got this movie for my 5 year old son because he quit believing in Santa so I was hoping to show him that Saint Nick was a real man at one time so maybe my son would at least know some where it all came from. It showed him a little bit but things need to be explained to him in a different kind of way. This movie basically just kept saying ""Maybe Santa is real and maybe he's not."" My son Knows hes not real (he's got a mind like a scientist, you have to physically show him things or he just doesn't believe. Everything needs to be proven too him) so this movie just wasn't for him. But I guess it was alright other then the fact it was not what I was looking for.",1354406400,,667,3.8405797101449277
705707,5,630362815X,"Shipped fast. I was thrilled to find this A&E Biography, I have been looking for it for a while. I grew up watching it, A&E interviewed my Grandpa and most of the images used were from his private collection. It became a family tradition and I'm glad I have my own copy.",1354147200,,270,4.211538461538462
705708,3,630362815X,"I purchased this movie for my middle school students. I needed something to end our ""non-fiction"" writing unit, and since we'd studied biographies and it was December, this seemed like a good pick. Unfortunately, I liked it a lot more than they did. The guests they interviewed and the history behind Santa was captivating for me, but the kids all fell asleep! Basically, I think you'll enjoy this if you are a History Channel lover like me, a Christmas fan, or just someone who likes stories behind pop culture. However, the kids said it was ""soooooooo boring"". I should've known! :)",1325808000,,584,4.792079207920792
705709,5,630362815X,"If you're in the mood to relax and watch a well-told history of the man in red this is the DVD for you!  If you're an educator this is great for students, to teach them not about religion but about a well-known character in our past/present/future!!",1318896000,,249,4.413043478260869
705710,4,630362815X,It was a gift but the recipient said that it made it in good time and was in good condition.,1266451200,,92,3.65
705711,5,630362815X,"A&E's Award Winning Series BIOGRAPHY featuring non-other than SANTA CLAUS.

This 50 minute color DVD uncovers the real history of this endearing Christian character.  Pieces of todays 'Santa Claus' through this biography are derived from fact, legends, traditional folklore tales from all over Europe, Mideast and North & South Americas.  A very interesting woven tapestry of information about this lovable Christmas Spirit of love and giving.  Even a Patron Saint of children, sailors, merchantmen and more.

A very enjoyable and enlightening story.  Very educational and provides many pictures of this jolly old elf.

I highly recommend this holiday treat!!  Enjoy!!!",1258329600,7,669,5.62
705712,5,630362815X,"(This review is of the VHS-version) For an hour's length, this movie packs a lot of interesting film footage and illustrations and information about Santa.... and will be interesting for adults and teens who enjoy biographies and love Christmas.  This is the first Christmas movie I watch every year, and I never tire of seeing it!",1258156800,,331,4.910714285714286
705713,2,630362815X,"For the most part, I thought this was a very interesting DVD.  However, I let my 3 and 7 year old children watch it with me.  Near the beginning, there was a graphic cartoon image of three little boys who had mutilated and stuffed into a pickle barrel.  St. Nicholas brought them back to life and was able to reassemble their bodies.  I really didn't think it was necessary to have such a violent visual image.  Also, near the end of the movie, there was a brief segment about how Santa is not always seen as a good guy---there was a movie clip of some murderer in a Santa suit chasing a person with an ax.  Again, was that really necessary?  There should definitely be a warning at the beginning of the show telling parents that there are some images which might not be suitable for young kids.  Or, here's a crazy thought, just delete the violent scenes!  It's a Christmas DVD which the whole family should be able to watch.",1230595200,16,926,4.368421052631579
705714,2,630362815X,"I had purchased the VHS version of this show some years ago.  It is a great video. Jack Perkins has one of those great ""booming baritone"" voices for doing voice-over work and a great personality to go along with it. When I saw that a DVD of the show was available, I bought it. Within minutes of playing it, I discovered that this DVD version is NOT simply the VHS version on DVD but an entirely different one. So if you're thinking that this DVD is just a ""remastered"" version of the original VHS version, be forewarned. I can't speak highly enough of the ""original"" VHS version. Absolutely one of my favorite Christmas videos.",1230163200,14,628,4.508771929824562
705715,5,630362815X,"A delightful chronological review of the Santa Claus figure from pre-Christian through St Nicholas and most fascinating, just how the standardized modern Santa evolved to his present form. Great fun and does not destroy the Santa myth since the spirit of Santa is the same whatever he looks like.",1197331200,5,296,5.061224489795919

7853011,5,630362815X,"Although this is not the complete 1994 A&E version with Jack Perkins, which I have on VHS, this has most of what that version showed and then much more.  It's even BETTER.
It's got more updated footage and not as much historic, sometimes dull dialogue as the earlier version.  Great for all ages.",1356825600,2,296,4.566037735849057
