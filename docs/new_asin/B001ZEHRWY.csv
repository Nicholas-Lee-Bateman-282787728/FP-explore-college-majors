8348323,5,B001ZEHRWY,"I love this DVD. The instructino is simple to follow and he provides some great ways of thinking about playing differently. Not everyone can be Marty Friedman (in fact no one else can). But if you like seeing inside how guys like this think, get this DVD and take time to consider what he is trying to do with his playing. Thus, you will discover what sets him apart.
A definitely worthy purchase.
Beware, however, you may want to neglect other aspects of your life after receiving this DVD. :)",1323734400,,494,4.5
8348324,5,B001ZEHRWY,"Marty Friedman is one of the all time great unknown guitar players. He got most of his recognition playing with Megadeth but a lot of people don't know about his 2 albums with cacophony (the best shred metal band) or his solo work. In this DVD he offers a lot of very interesting advice about playing outside of the box. Namely using Japanese scales, playing in a 5/8 time signature, and playing over chord changes rather than doing pentatonic licks. Great tips from a great guitar player, also check out the Hotlicks DVD for Jason Becker (the other guitar player from Cacophony).",1252195200,9,580,4.696078431372549
