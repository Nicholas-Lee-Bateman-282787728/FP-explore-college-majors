8256913,5,B00150WALG,"I purchased this DVD after viewing the DVD ""For as long as we both shall laugh"".  I really liked this DVD so much that I ordered a second DVD for a friend who appreciates Yakov Smirnoff's humor as much as I do.  Both DVDs arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  So glad I found this man who shares his humor in a very patriotic way for all ages of audiences.  I hope to go see him in Branson, MO at Christmas.  Highly recommend this DVD.",1438646400,,442,4.152941176470589
