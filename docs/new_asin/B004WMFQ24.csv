8445309,5,B004WMFQ24,"This documentary opened our eyes wide to the dangers of processed foods.  The film maker establishes the connection early on between well-known household brand names and the increased profits these companies make from  food additives that result in longer shelf life, visual appeal, and of course sensory (taste) appeal.  Thus the apt title, ""InGREEDients.""  The film definitely focusses on hydrogenated oils, but also discusses other food additives in brief including coloring, artificial flavorings and sweeteners, and a list of chemicals many of which are unknown to but consumed unquestioningly by the general public.  The point is so well made concerning hydrogenated oils, that the viewer was left with only concerns about the many other additives in our packaged foods, especially those geared to children.  The film producer's background and experience as a nurse, as well as expert testimony from researchers and public health workers, lent credence to the concerns expressed in this film, and provided examples and support for the negative health toll on Americans.  He also tells the story of adulterated vegetable oil well from its beginnings in the early 1900s with the Crisco craze.  This is a great DVD to show family and friends to wake them up to the reality that we cannot just go to our grocery stores and fill our cart with whatever is on the shelves without looking at what we are buying.  Is it food??  There is a direct correlation between the high rate of illness today and what we eat.  We showed this to some family and they immediately went to the pantry and started looking at food labels and making plans to switch to other products.  We just trust our food, and we need to be warned with good information.  Thank you for making a great resource to help American families make healthier food choices!",1348704000,2,1829,4.9769736842105265
8445310,2,B004WMFQ24,"This movie only describes trans fats in detail. I thought it would talk about many food additives like HFCS, colorings, preservatives, artificial flavors, etc. It did mention aspartame but left no concrete information about it. It was interesting to me that the movie maker was a nurse who did not even know what ""partially hydrogenated oils"" were.

This is an okay movie for true beginners, those who eat fast food and don't ever read their food labels. If you already take the time to read labels and buy healthy organic foods rather than fast food then skip this one.

I am a vegan of over 8 years and was hoping to find a good film on food additives, but this is not it :(",1303776000,8,676,4.443548387096774
