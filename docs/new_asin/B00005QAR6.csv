7950061,5,B00005QAR6,"Taking place in the year Universal Century 0079 (Same time as the original ""Mobile Suit Gundam"") Mobile Suit Gundam: 8th Mobile Suit Team tells the story of Shiro Armada and his team of Mobile Suit Pilots, for those wondering 8th MS is a great thing to watch if you are just now getting into Gundam. Now most Gundam series tell the story of a 15 year old Dragged into the war and how he and his friends win the war, 8th ms team is the opposite, it actually documents what the ""regular"" people were like in the time, they use regular robots that do not have the power to take down an entire fleet, and they fight against other regular robots like ""Zaku II's"". With that said you get to watch the team do various operations, like freeing a town from the control of ZEON, or doing stuff in the desert. One scene I really like is a scene where they are actually preforming maintence on a robot, scenes like this actually imerese the viewer in the feeling that this is what being a soilder is like.
The characters also have human sides, Shiro is trying to prove himself and keep his dysfunctional team intact, Micheal (Spelling) is suffering the woes of a long distance relationship, and there are many other characters with ""human"" problems, the characters also are not imortal, there are times when their MS get destroyed, and they get injured. There is also a love story, which I find rather interesting, because it has that whole ""Two soilders on different sides fall in love."" feel.
Would I suguest it? YES! to everyone. 8th ms team really shows what it would be like to be a grunt in the earth federation army, and also has a nice love story in it.",1084579200,,1649,4.445544554455446
7950062,5,B00005QAR6,The episodes here are good but the reason why it Episode8 isn't 45 minutes is because Cartoon Network broadcast some parts from Miller's Report (The 08th Ms Team Movie recap) which had some more footage,1071100800,2,202,4.8
7950063,4,B00005QAR6,"I admit that this is probably one of the best Gundam incarnations ever (I liked Wing, but I felt that it got repetetive in its action sequences and without Endless Waltz to close up the story, it stays that way). I enjoyed every single episode but there's just one thing that bothers me about this DVD rendition. Well, actually, two things, but one may just be my DVD players (a Playstation 2 and an old pre-DTS Sony):
1)the part that may just be me. The transfer of these episodes is really pretty bad as there seems to be some kind of flicker control problem. Whatever was being used to transfer the episodes to disc, it hated horizontal lines, especially on characters' mouths (they seemed to just disappear occasionally and flicker sporadically). But trust me, it is hardly worth complaining about (and it is not why this only gets four stars instead of a solid 5)
2)the part that really got on my nerves, hence the ""What The?""
What happened to Episode 8? When I first saw this on Cartoon Network's Midnight Run,  I was surprised that the episode ran 45 minutes! Though this is typical of an OAV series to have differing lengths in episodes, but for those extra 15 minutes to not be included in the DVD or VHS editions? What's going on?
The extra fifteen minutes of episode 8 are spent on a subplot involving ""That Intel Chick"" as Karen calls her. The episode actually ends with a standoff between Amada and the former Zeon spy...at gunpoint! It also involves the true return of Eledore from the field hospital, so his sudden appearance in episode 9 doesn't seem so...well, sudden.
Though my bet is now that they'll incorporate the footage into episode 10 as a flashback (though that would still through off the flow of the story).
So, that is the reason for this mere 4 stars, the flicker-problem is pale in comparison to the simple deletion of an entire subplot that enhances the storyline and gives the characters a dynamic boost.
So enjoy, but be warned, these episodes will feel incomplete...because they are!",1008028800,3,2018,4.668539325842697
7950064,5,B00005QAR6,"This has some of the best parts to the movie with the crash landing on the mountain and the subsuqent things needed to be done to survive being the best.  This is series is a must have for any true anime fan, even if you aren't in to mecha battles.  I wish they had done more the 13 episodes for this, and can't wait for the ending.  If you have only seen this series on cartoon network, get the dvd, you will be amazed at what was edited.",1006214400,,439,3.965909090909091
7950065,5,B00005QAR6,"08th MS Team is one of my favorite anime series, and this DVD is awesome! These three episodes are some of the best episodes, though I can't wait for Episode 10 to come out. When the Zeon team invades Kiki's village, you would expect them to be villainous, but infact they aren't. They are just looking for some provisions, and are kind as can be to the villagers, showing that there are good people on the so-called ""bad"" side of the war. And when Shiro and Aina are being questioned after being found in the mountains together, that was one of the best parts of the series that shows the true emotion and realism to 08th MS Team. I really enjoy these episodes and am thrilled they are out on DVD. Don't pass this DVD up, because Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team is one of the best gundam series out there. Sieg Zeon!",1001462400,3,822,4.309677419354839
