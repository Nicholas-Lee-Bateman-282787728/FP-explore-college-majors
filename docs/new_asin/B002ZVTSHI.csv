4042820,5,B002ZVTSHI,This workout is fantastic.  It's a very balanced workout and works the upper and lower body and abs as well.  The instructor is phenomenal and does a great job motivating you throughout the entire workout.  I highly recommend it!,1265500800,8,229,4.82051282051282
4042821,5,B002ZVTSHI,One week after doing this ELLE Sculpt DVD and i already feel sexier- lost a few of pounds and am definitely feeling way more toned. Sara Haley is a great instructor and can help even the average gal (me :)) get that brooklyn body! This is a must get- the rest of the series is awesome too!,1264118400,3,289,4.087719298245614
4042822,5,B002ZVTSHI,"I bought the 3 pack, which was a better deal and a complete workout.  The workouts are really good because they cater to all different fitness levels. I lost 6 lbs in the first 2 weeks!!! My stamina is a lot better too and I've started running in addition to the DVDs.  The bonus material on packing and beauty superfoods is great and really helpful.",1264118400,5,350,4.369230769230769
4042823,5,B002ZVTSHI,"I bought these DVDs after seeing them advertised in Elle-it's more affordable to buy all three at once. This dvd is broken into 2-20 minute workouts and both are challenging and fun. A great mix of cardio and weights. I would say this dvd is suitable for intermediate exercisers.

Brooklyn is fun and the trainer explains the moves in more specifics. I love the outdoor setting of the video and it's fun to watch and enjoyable to do the exercises (which are innovative).

The one con is in each 20 minute segment there is entire sequence repeated (which can be a bit boring).

The rest of the dvd extras are great--another couple super-short workouts and packing/travel tips (which are actually pretty helpful). The extras call for a weighted ball for the ab routine but can be done with a weight. Otherwise the only equipment needed is a set of hand weights.

I like the style, setting and originality of this series.",1262390400,9,918,4.683229813664596
4042824,5,B002ZVTSHI,"Felt great after doing this workout the first time - I've mostly been doing the cardio and yoga discs from this Elle Make Better series, but I know I'll start adding this one to my weekly workout as well. The tips from the lifestyle portion of the DVD are great as well - this whole series is really helping me feel like I'm ""making myself better.""",1262131200,3,348,4.287878787878788
8385364,3,B002ZVTSHI,"I exercise at home daily using fitness DVDs.  I usually shy away from ""celebrity"" videos (although I have tried a few others), but it seemed like this might be a nice change of pace.  First, the DVD does offer a real instructor, Reebok's Sara Haley, and second, I liked the idea that it featured two short (approximately 20 minutes each) workouts, as I thought this would be a good option for when I was shorter on time.

The Main Menu offers options for Play All - Beauty Sculpt Warm-Up - Beauty Sculpt Workout 1 - Beauty Sculpt Workout 2 - 50 Minute Power Option - Bonus Menu.  I have described each segment briefly below.

WARM-UP (11.5 minutes)
This exceedingly long warm-up starts off rather chill.  Haley leads model Brooklyn Decker through large, fluid movements such as squats with arm circles and dynamic stretches.  Given this, it was a bit of a shock that for the last 3 minutes or so, they jump suddenly into impact moves, include high knees, heel kicks, and jumping jacks; I definitely would have preferred a more gradual aerobic warm-up.

BEAUTY SCULPT WORKOUT 1 (17.5 minutes)
This routine is described as an ""interval based full-body workout.""  Using what appears to be very light weights (3 or 5 lbs.), Haley and Decker perform compound movements such as a plie squat with front arm raise and a ""tennis serve"" (twist from one shoulder to opposite hip).  The are also combination moves that include a balance aspect--e.g., a side squat with a knee raise and bicep curl.  After completing a series of movements on the right side of the body, Haley leads Decker through fast interval work.  This includes some high knees, jumping moves, etc. (Haley does provide an option to remain lower impact).  Haley times the interval work, and after several moves, the entire sequence is repeated on the left side, starting with the strength work and finishing with the intervals.  There is no cool-down.

BEAUTY SCULPT WORKOUT 2 (21 minutes)
Although this workout is described as ""abs work, speed moves, and intervals,"" it follows the EXACT same format as the first routine.  Haley introduces compound moves one-by-one--e.g., a plie squat with a side arm lift, a curtsy squat with chest press--first performing each exercise individually, then repeatedly taking it from the top to perform all of the moves in a ""flow.""  She refers to this flow as raising the heart rate, but most people will NOT see an aerobic benefit from the light weights and slow pace of the routine.  As with the first workout, after completing the moves on the right side, Haley leads Decker through what she calls ""speed and agility"" drills--basically, these are moves performed slow, then at a quick pace for 10 seconds.  All of the strength exercises are then repeated on the left side, concluding with the speed and agility drills.  There is no cool-down.

The 50 minute workout is simply the entire routine put together.  The Bonus Menu actually offers additional workout options, including Bonus Sculpt Workout 1 (5:53 minutes), a side plank challenge, and Bonus Sculpt Workout 2 (3:09 minutes), a core-focused routine using a weighted ball (or a dumbbell).  There's also a section on 1-Minute Workouts, Beauty on the Go, Pack Like a Pro, plus interviews with both Haley and Decker.

In the end, I was disappointed by this DVD, which seemed mainly to be a vehicle for Decker.  I didn't like how Decker introduced the workouts (shouldn't the trainer be doing this?).  Also, it seemed like Haley was reluctant to correct Decker's form.  This might be a good video for those who are new to fitness DVDs and who don't do much strength training, but I would advise more experienced exercisers to look elsewhere.",1404172800,2,3689,4.8514376996805115
8385365,4,B002ZVTSHI,a great workout to get in shape with various exercices for all parts of the body. 2 workouts so you can swich from day to day,1400198400,,125,3.8461538461538463
8385366,5,B002ZVTSHI,"I got this a little more than a year ago. When I first got it I'd do it three times a week and had to pause in between each segment and would stumblr or sit out of a few poses. Fast-forward a year later, I'm doing the program once a week, have worked up to more stamina, balance, and strenth, have made exercise a daily practice, and still am in a puddle of sweat and panting by the end. This DVD is AMAZING! Some reasons:
the steps come in multiple levels
you learn important techniques that you need for multiple workouts
it seperates right body from left so after you do 10 minutes you have to do 10 more
it's short segments allow you to pick a short or longer workout
you get strong
and you'll never stop seeing results!",1345593600,,724,4.178571428571429

The dvd defentily delivers! this is one of my favortie workout dvd of all time along with the other 2 dvds.
i can see the diffence in my body after doing this workout for a couple months!",1310515200,2,307,4.310344827586207
8385369,5,B002ZVTSHI,I found out about these workout DVD's in Elle Magazine and I have read many feature articles on Brooklyn Decker. I like her and so that helped my decision in this purchase. I am glad I bought them. They are easy for people like me who do not have a lot of experience in working out. The instructor in the video made it easy for me to achieve good form while preforming these exercise moves. I recommend these to anyone who needs to start somewhere in their physical activity regime.,1298937600,,482,4.366666666666666
8385370,5,B002ZVTSHI,"I'm a physical therapist, and this is a great workout video combining upper and lower strengthening with cardio intervals. My muscles burned so bad the next day! The trainer is very good, and is specific about posture and body mechanic issues common with working out that most people don't pay attention to. It is important to make sure your body mechanics are right with strengthening because just a slight difference can cause you to work a whole other group of muscles. Great workout! This one is by far the best of the three make better body.  I also like that you can see Brooke struggling sometimes, and that is always a motivator, its not always easy to see everyone on the videos completing it like a piece of cake.",1295913600,,723,4.604651162790698
8385371,3,B002ZVTSHI,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

I only used this for the 2, 20 minute workouts.  Both are circuit type training with a combination of weights and short cardio bursts.  An extra round (same moves, fewer reps, more speed) is always done at the end for maximum impact.  I used a single 10lb weight for the first workout and two 5lbs for the second.  Would not mind if there was a third workout for abs (or more of the same, just to make it a bit longer.)  The warmup was a bit long but ended up being almost part of the workout (not all stretching, seems like they gradually got into the workout moves, just less intense.)  There was no cooldown but I actually prefer to do my own so that was not a problem for me.

Worked up a good sweat on this.  Instructor was non-annoying for me --- would be interested in other workout DVDs by her.  As others have noted, the price is a bit up there for a workout DVD, probably because of the bonus feature (which I am not interested in) and the fact that Brooklyn is in it (she came across non annoying, also.)  Would have been happier to have a cheaper price and less extraneous material.

btw, the amazon video clips for this ELLE series seem to be all messed up.  Better to google video clips for the series elsewhere to get accurate previews.",1293408000,,1307,4.307377049180328
8385372,5,B002ZVTSHI,"I'm a fairly advanced exerciser and got a GREAT workout! I had the pleasure of trying it free for thirty minutes on Exercise TV and can't wait to own this DVD! Most workout DVD's endorsed by models are easy and pretty much just them showing off how beautiful they are, but I can honestly say this one kicked my butt, burned almost 400 calories in 30 minutes.",1293062400,3,358,4.358208955223881
8385373,5,B002ZVTSHI,"I purchased the Three Set Series, Beauty Sculpt, Cardio Body and Workout Yoga.  I have to say I thought I was in pretty good shape but these really gave me a great workout!  I do a different DVD each day.  I really enjoyed the Beauty Sculpt so much that when I saw the Reebok Cardio Tone DVD which is by the same instructor I just had to buy it.  Sara Haley is a great motivator and her workouts are easy to follow and keep up with and give you a great fun workout!  I like the fact that they are not to much dance aerobic type workouts because I have a difficult time with the dance type moves. I can't wait for another DVD to add to my collection!",1270598400,3,649,4.0
