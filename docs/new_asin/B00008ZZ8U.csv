1876488,5,B00008ZZ8U,"Excellent actors who litteraly make the movie so credible. It's a deep story of a man and woman who find their destiny crossed when they both loose the one man they love. The acting is sensational, you are carried away in many different emotions, you see the whole story behind neutral eyes, it's great.",1075334400,3,303,4.62962962962963
1876489,5,B00008ZZ8U,"This is an amazing film!!  It is touching, and heart warming wihtout ever getting to be sacharine or melodramatic.  The characters are strong and believable and the acting is superb!  Foreign movies are great and Italian is a beautiful language to hear!  If it helps in your decision the cast is very attractive, and there is one very hot make out scene between three guys.  If you are looking for a lot of skin though this is not the movie for you, this is a movie of human relationships and dealing with loss; not to mention coming to terms with the people we love.  The main character is a woman who's husband has just died.  She discovers he has been having a relationship with another man for 7 years (seti ani).  The two (the wife and the other man) become friends and discover things about the man they both loved that they never knew before.  It is a complex and engrossing story that can be viewed more than once.  So if you have not purchased this DVD yet get to it!!  You will not be sorry.",1069113600,46,1001,4.327956989247312
1876490,4,B00008ZZ8U,"Wow--what a powerful story.  I'm not normally one to pick up a foreign movie (I hate reading subtitles; that's what books are for!), but the story sounded very intriguing: a recent widow who was in a happy, loving marriage discovers that her husband was living a double-life...with another man for seven years.  Both of his relationships were loving...and he obviously couldn't bring himself to pick between the two because he loved both of them.  In a sense, he was monogamous...with two people.
The movie was even better than I had expected.  There was so much emotion between the main characters -- the two ""widows.""  I loved that there was tension at the beginning between the two and, from the love of the same man, they eventually grew a friendship...and grew to love each other as well.  It was a very moving story, and I highly recommend it.",1066089600,19,849,4.741496598639456
1876491,4,B00008ZZ8U,A worthy effort. Strong acting. Intelligent story. Why can't American filmmakers be as skillful in treating subjects like this in their films? (P.S. I've never seen so many handsome men in one film),1054857600,6,198,5.03030303030303

1876495,5,B00008ZZ8U,"Enjoyed this Italian film very much!!  What a group of actors!!!  Many are from the film, ""Saturn in Opposition"".  This story also has an imperceptible ""twist"" to it that you will not expect, either.  I love the actress who portrays Ms. Buy's mother!!  A great outlook to have on life!!!  Enjoy!!",1338595200,,296,4.705882352941177
1876496,5,B00008ZZ8U,"This is an amazing and touching story that begins with a life changing event and reminds us that we are all changed by the many people who touch our lives--whether or not we are aware of it.

The acting is top notch, as is the story which examines the dual life of a man who loves both his wife as well as his male lover.

As the stoy unfolds, I was forced to re-examine my views on the dual lives that so many of us are forced to live.. whether or not they result from being gay/lesbian or some other reason altogether.

What became clear to me was that one each of the worlds that were examined transformed the players in such a way that they became better suited for the people they loved in their other worlds as well.

Much of what Michele loved about Massimo, Antonia's husband existed only because of the bonds he shared with Antonia, and much of what Antonia loved in Massimo was empowered by the relatinship he shared with Michele.

To me it seemed that both worlds fed and nurtured the other... an unusual love triangle if you will which none of the key players were aware of.

The rest of the cast, the setting, the music etc was equally engaging.  I highly recommend this film. It's worth watching twice. It is an honest look at he complications of life and the many subplots that we all negotiate day to day.",1324166400,2,1321,4.323886639676114
1876497,5,B00008ZZ8U,"This is a wonderful film about friendship and community. It is warm and heart-touching. I'd intended to buy it for friends as a christmas present. But I cannot give a present in packaging which makes it look like sub-porn, utterly misrepresenting the film. Ferzan Ozpetek - a great director - must be in horror. Strand Releasing, shame on you.  (PS - have you seen what they have done to the packaging of 'Saturno Contro'? It's pitiful.)",1292630400,,437,4.75
1876498,5,B00008ZZ8U,"This has to be one of the best films I have seen this year, an Italian ""Tales of the City"" of sorts. Italian gay life comes vibrantly to life in the not so fashionable but beautiful and festinating Testaccio district of Rome. Here we are shown that love like life can grow in the most unexpected places and ways. That a family is more, or can be, than merely the one you are born into.
  ""His Secret Life"" is so Italian in it's humor, wit and deeply felt romanticism. You can see this in the very first scene set in the gorgeous classical museum, which is played out with smart homage to so many sophisticated modern Roman films from the past. Yet it is brave, and hip enough to take a unexpected turn that leads the players and the audience into a new world of unexpected joys and sorrows.
  The cast is outstanding and our star Margherita Buy is phenomenal. Such a fine actress should be seen beyond the borders of Italy.
  A really wonderful film that takes pride of place in my collection as one of the great moives and proof positive that good cinema is alive and well in Italy.
  Bravo Italia! Brava Margherita Buy la donna bella e una grande attrice!",1268006400,2,1157,4.373831775700935
1876499,5,B00008ZZ8U,"This is a beautiful story.  We fall in love with a wonderful group of people who have created a world of their own that is supportive, and special attention given to one of the group, Ernesto, who suffers from aids.  Into this group comes Antonia who, after the tragic death of her husband, discovers from an inscription on the back of one of his painting that he's had a seven year relationship with a man, Michaeli, in whose home the group meets on a regular basis.  The story of how Antonia becomes part of their world is quite moving, and through her work as a health provider for aids' patients she's able to bring Ernesto to a state of good health.  The group faces many more crises, but in the end we are left with a warm feeling that all will be well.  A hautning musical score.",1236384000,2,786,4.319727891156463
1876500,4,B00008ZZ8U,"I was pleasantly surprised that this film turned out to be much more multi-layered than the way it was marketed. A woman loses her husband in a car accident. She soon discovers her husband had a lover. She is more shocked to find that the lover was a man. At first angry and resentful, Antonia soon replaces her husband in his circle of friends. In so doing, she discovers he had a completely separate life which had nothing to do with hers. His friends know more about him than she did. The only person who doesn't welcome her with open arms, however, is her husband's lover, who feels as if she is trying to replace her husband with his group of quirky friends.

There is a sense of competition and jealousy between the two people who loved the dead man most. The jealousy and resentment only increases when Antonia is accepted into the fold of her husband's friends. The characters of the friends are fascinating. Many of them are Turkish immigrants, some are straight, some are gay, and one marvelous character is trans-gender. One of the young Turkish men even falls for the older Antonia. The end is a bit too tidy and stretches the limits of how to end a film in a tidy manner. Still, the characterizations are wonderful and the acting is very strong, and I enjoyed this movie very much.",1203897600,,1294,4.52991452991453
1876501,5,B00008ZZ8U,"I am not one to watch many movies with subtitles, but this movie is well worth watching! I rented it several times before I decided to purchase it. A purchase I won't ever regret! This movie really draws you in to all of the characters, which are very loveable. It is very tasteful and heart-warming.  I cannot say enough good things about this movie! Buy it, you WONT be sorry!!",1193702400,,379,4.414285714285715

1876503,5,B00008ZZ8U,"A beautifully wrought story of love and acceptance across many of the lines that divide society.  I felt uplifted by the warm hearted nature of this film which simultaneously completely avoids sappy sentimentality.  The film is full of surprises and it builds to the final scene so subtly that I have now watched it four times, each time seeing more of what the director layered into the film that brought me to the scene on the terrace.  This is well worth purchasing and it also shows the growth of the director over his earlier efforts.",1168300800,,539,4.652631578947369
1876504,4,B00008ZZ8U,"Antonia is a physician married to Massimo in what she thinks is a good marriage. When he is suddenly killed, she discovers quite by accident that he has had a male lover for seven years-- well, initially she assumes that the lover is female. She sets out to solve the mystery of her husband's betrayal and discovers his other nontraditional family consisting of Michele and an assorted group of other individuals, a transexual, a lesbian and other gay men et al. Antonia becomes friends with Michele and toys with having an affair with his friend Emir.

The film makes a beautiful statement on the meaning of family, particularly for those who live outside the traditional dad-mom-and-baby-makes-three definition. Michele takes care of his sick friend Ernesto who has AIDS and is living with him. This entire family supports each other in ways any family should and manages to have a lot of good times in living every day.

Margherita Buy as Antonia and Stefano Accorsi as Michele are well cast. The supporting actors give good performances as well.

Be sure and watch this one on a big screen or the subtitles (the film is in Italian) will get in the way of the visuals.",1167523200,2,1171,4.758620689655173
1876505,4,B00008ZZ8U,"""His Secret Life"" tells the story of the wife of a bisexual man, who discovers his other life for the first time after his sudden death in a traffic accident, and she befriends his lover and the Gay family of which he had been a part, secretly.  Margherita Buy is lovely as the widow, and handles her role with grace, beauty and sensitivity that binds the film together, effortlessly.  Stefano Accorsi plays the lover, who is jealous and resentful of her at first, but ultimately finds himself attracted to her, probably for many of the same reasons that her husband loved her so.

While the family consists of those who might be considered societal misfits by many people, love and caring bind them together and attract the widow to the group.  By understanding them, and what her husband found so special in them, she comes to understand him more fully, and her love for him and his memory deepens.  Her anger at his death, and her anger with respect to the lie that his death foist upon her, lessen and finally disappear as she appreciates and accepts the choices that he made in life, putting her first in actuality.

Also, it is the story of two people, the widow and her husband, who bridge the Gay and straight worlds and find beauty and love in both.",1151971200,5,1258,4.54424778761062
1876506,4,B00008ZZ8U,"Like any discerningly skeptical blue /porn film custumer, I would usually SKIP a flick with a stereotypical flesh-baring cover like this. But a friend recommended it so I quickly watched it and finally had to let my judgement down - the story feels as good as you watch it twice.

The character of Antonia, the widow who discovered her late husband's 7-year affair with a man, is a remarkable growing spirit and it takes a tour de force for Margherita Buy to play out her guts.",1143331200,3,477,4.546511627906977
1876507,5,B00008ZZ8U,"THE STORY IS PERHAPS A LITTLE PREDICTIBLE, BUT IT IS SET IN ITALY, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFERENT FOR THE AMERICAN AUDIENCE.

GENERALLY THE FIL DEALS WITH TOLERANCE, WITH HAVING A CHOSEN FAMILY, AND WITH ACCEPTANCE.- UNDERSTANDING THE STRAIGHT WORLD AND THE GAY WORLD THROUGH THE EYES OF A WOMAN AND A MAN WHO SHARED THE SAME MAN.

THE STORY OF BEING THE OTHER WOMAN-AS BOTH CHARACTERS WERE ""THE OTHER WOMAN"", AND THE ROLLS THEY TAKE AND ASSUME GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.",1138924800,2,463,4.775
1876508,5,B00008ZZ8U,"""HIS SECRET LIFE"" is a well directed, good story.  You already know what it's about, so I will tell you that I liked the way the characters are portrayed.  The people seem real and the theme isn't heavy-handed at all.

An all-around enjoyable movie, I wanted to call ""His Secret Life"" the best gay movie ever, but I already said that about ""Come Undone"".  Also, this is broader than a gay movie by any comparison.  (If you have any doubt, watch this and then see the sex scenes in ""Come Undone"" and you'll agree that ""His Secret Life"" is far more appealing to people who are not gay.  Tell ya what, if you wanna lock yourself up with a couple great movies then that is the pair.

This very good film, ""His Secret Life"", is everything that another one I saw is not:  ""Steam: The Turkish Bath"" is a very bad knockoff of ""HSL"".  Rather than waste good time and money on that one, SEE ""HIS SECRET LIFE"" TWICE -- and also see the NEXT flick, below:

IF YOU LIKE ""HSL"", THEN YOU WILL  L-O-V-E ""Making Love"", Starring Michael Ontkean, Harry Hamlin and Kate Jackson, 3 fine actors who put in some of their best work here.  The music is also excellent, by that I mean the title song, ""Making Love (There's more to love, than making love)"".  It reads just like 2005, though it was released in 1982.  It oughtta be on DVD by now, but it's still VHS, and is available from Amazon.

Why are you still reading?  Go watch the movie already.  ""His Secret Life"" is everything it promises to be.",1129334400,3,1477,4.3321167883211675
1876509,5,B00008ZZ8U,"His Secret Life, directed by Ferzan Ozpetek, tells the story of a Italian couple Massimo (Andrea Renzi) and Anotonia (Margherita Bay) who have been married for many 15 years and are deeply in love, then one day Massimo is struck and killed by a car. It is after the funeral that Anotnia tries to pull her life back together, and she finds evidence that perhaps Massimo has been having an affair, thus ensues the search for the woman. Her search leads her to Michele (Stefano Accorsi) and what ensues is a painful discovery that test the depth of human emotions from both actors.

Margherita Bay and Stefano Accorsi are beautiful and smart together, the acting is real and raw and the emotional conflict between the two characters captures the viewer and you feel their anguish, betrayal and sense of lost. Director Ferzan Ozpetek for his credit does not contrain the actors or the script and really does take the time to develop the conflict and resolution which adds to the greatness of this film----how well do we really know others and for that matter ourselves. The writing is clean, crisp, and refreshing from the normal drug--sleazy sex scene which seems obessesed in the gay film world. Simple put this movie is true treasure and one you should add to your film collection.",1113350400,5,1280,4.7657657657657655
1876510,5,B00008ZZ8U,"I just loved this movie! The story is intriguing, clever and real, however to really grasp the meaning of it, you must be hypocrisy-free!

As an heterosexual wife and mother of 2 young adult heterosexual boys, I was very pleased of seeing a movie which portrait gays under a different light and point of view.",1102982400,6,309,4.618181818181818
1876511,5,B00008ZZ8U,"His Secret Life touched me. I found myself thoroughly engrossed with the story and relating to both main characters, and the secondary ones. The kind of real emotion and character development is exactly what's missing in most Hollywood films, making me turn to the Foreign section most of the time. This is one of the best gay-themed films I have seen, one anyone can enjoy and relate to. It is a sweet film, heart-warming and touching without being overly sentimental. The chacters are thouroughly developed and experience real emotions as they deal with loss and heartbreak. Words cannot describe how this movie affected me and made me long for a better world where people can care about each other as much as this small group does. A wonderfully entertaining and emotional experience that is highly recommended.
P.S. Despite the preview, this is not sexually explicit and only features one scene of a gay threesome. The rest of the film is tame.",1089331200,32,948,4.894409937888199
1876512,5,B00008ZZ8U,"In a nutshell, a womans husband is killed crossing a busy road (possibly the worst effects I've seen on film in many years) and when packing away his things, comes across a painting with a message from his lover on the back.  She tracks 'her' down, and discovers she is in fact a he.
Naturally she is upset and cant understand the life her husband has lead for the last seven years, but over time, she gets to know his lover and his friends, both learning things about their lover that they never knew.
I heartily recommend this film - not for those just looking for flesh though.  So many gay films are below par, and either over play the sentiment or are just too trashy.  This is not one of them.  This really is a beautiful film; all the characters are played with sensitivity and the film is so well acted, especially by the lead actress.
(NB: This films original title is translated as 'Ignorant Fairies', which is the name of the painting in the movie - the title shouldnt have been dumbed down, and the cover art! so cheap looking.  The international covers are much more appropriate.)",1086307200,13,1093,4.472361809045226
1876513,5,B00008ZZ8U,"I've seen several mediocre gay-themed movies lately, and I was expecting more of the same here. I couldn't have been farther from the mark.

This wonderfully crafted film is exquisite in every way. It's beautifully and creatively directed and filmed, it's very well written, and the performances of the two lead actors, in particular, take your breath away.

Since the movie is Italian, there is an allowance for ambiguity and lack of definition to emotions that is indeed ""foreign"" to American films. The characters and situations are not black and white -- which, as we all know, is much closer to the way life truly is.

This is a movie to own and treasure, not just to rent. Anyone who collects foreign films should have this. It's that good.",1077926400,9,746,4.767441860465116

The script is sensitively written, without ever being maudlin, and it's believable. Italy provides a gorgeous, lush backdrop against which the film's story unfolds. Transgendered, Italian, Turkish, straight, gay, young, old, gorgeous, average, and not-so-attractive -- characters of these types are abundant and provide something for everyone.
