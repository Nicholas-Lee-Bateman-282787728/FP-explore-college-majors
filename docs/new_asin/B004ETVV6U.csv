8427639,5,B004ETVV6U,"I love PANDORA HEARTS.
I actually like the anime better than the manga, acually.
Anyway, This is pretty big and takes up a lot of space. However, if your a fan of the PANDORA HEARTS anime, then you'll want to get this.
In fact, youd regret not getting it.
If you got Volume two then you'll definately want Volume one.
Oh, and if you like the art book, it comes with that to.

Ahh... if your hesitating because you don't know if theres a region coding or not, let me put your mind at ease. You can play these DVDs in America.",1430697600,,524,4.137254901960785
8427640,5,B004ETVV6U,Great quality and very nice item!  Trying to find Premium Edition volume 2 because this one is so nice!  Received the item very quickly.,1344902400,,136,4.625
8427641,4,B004ETVV6U,"Oz Vessalius is the privileged son of one of the four Great Dukes and heir to his father's title. He leads an idyllic life with his little sister and best friend/servant, Gilbert. But on his 15th birthday, during his Coming of Age Ceremony, he is attacked by a strange group of people who throw him into a different dimension, a dark prison known as the Abyss. There he meets Alice, a strange girl with the power to turn into a large black rabbit with great strength. After she saves him from a creature called a Chain, he agrees to enter a contract with her in order to return to his world.

The story of Pandora Hearts is engaging and intriguing. The plot moves along quickly and has many mysteries to explore. But a good plot isn't enough, good characters are also important. And this is where Pandora Hearts surprised me the most - it had good characters. Oz is perhaps one of the most interesting characters I've seen in anime. He seems to be pretty average at first - spoiled and a bit of a bully, but really a nice guy. Then the traumatic past is introduced and it is suggested that his sunny personality is just a mask for the darkness within. But low and behold, Oz actually listens to people who criticize his character and he is able to see his own flaws. Then, miracles of miracles, he actually tries to address those flaws. Oz's character development is primarily wrought through his own action, not though other characters shaping him, as so many other character developments normally go. I found it an extremely interesting and refreshing change.

The art for the series is beautiful and detailed. But I had a hard time appreciating it though the terrible video quality of the DVDs. When I first started watching, within minutes I paused it to do some research online to find out why it looked so terrible (and when I say terrible, I say it as someone who rarely notices video quality). It isn't a problem specific to my set (note here, I have the Standard Edition, but the video should be the same as the Premium), as far as I could tell, the problem had to do with the brightness being turned way up. If the scene was light enough you couldn't really tell, but as soon as it got black everything went pixlated. It was terrible, but I got used to it eventually.

I really liked this series. Even with the horrible video quality, I don't regret buying the sets. However, there is one thing you should be warned of before diving in - it doesn't end. The manga (which I have not read) is currently at 17 volumes in Japan and is still ongoing. It is being published here in the US and is at 10 volumes right now, with 4 more scheduled for release. I didn't know this until after I watched the last episode and was like ""What the h*** happened to the answers?"" There is no second season. The anime ends with most of the big mysteries unexplained. I still recommend this show, but know what you are getting into.

About the DVDs: Audio is Japanese only, English subtitles. Extras include several Omake episodes and clean opening and ending. The only difference between the Standard and the Premium is that the latter comes with a 32 page hardcover art book. This set comes with 2 DVDs and 13 episodes, while the second set contains the last 12 episodes of the series.

UPDATE 5/14: It was recently announced that the manga would be ending with volume 23. It is very unlikely that the anime would ever be continued, but at least the end of the story will be available if you are so inclined.",1338336000,5,3500,4.471048513302034

8427643,3,B004ETVV6U,"I purchased both parts of this series at an anime convention so I got a discount on it.  The story was good and the Japanese voice actors were great.  Even the translation for the subtitles was pretty good.  But I had a problem with the picture quality.  The animation was great so it was sad that some of the scenes had a lot of noise they were pretty fuzzy.  It seemed that it was the dark scenes that were the worst.  But then others were nice and clear.  Really if I had known about the quallity I probably wouldn't have bought it even for the price that I paid for it.  I was really looking forward to watching this series since I enjoy the manga so much but this one problem took a fair amount of my enjoyment away.  Other than that I liked the series.  Now I'm not sure if this is was something that was problem in Japan.  Or if this is caused by a poor quality transfer from the domestic company.  I don't own any other series from this company so I don't know if this is their typical quality.  If this is the reason it seems that the price is rather high if they're not going to take the time to distribute a higher quality product.  Even the art book that comes with it, as neat as it was, doesn't really make up for this problem.",1312502400,,1241,4.116666666666666
8427644,5,B004ETVV6U,"I started off by going into Borders one day and talking to one of the workers who told me to check out Pandora Hearts, so I started off with the manga and fell in love with the series from the first page. Soon after I ventured onto Amazon only too see they had there series on here, I bought it on impulse without even a second thought.

This series is one of the best series I have ever seen, it is a clever spin on a very popular title that everyone knows, (Alice in Wonderland.) But where it brings the story is fantastic. I have enjoyed every moment of th series and I can't wait to continue to watch it.

This by far is my new favorite show.

It is subbed in English, but the I enjoy the original Japanese voice actors.

If you are looking for a great new series to get into, Pandora Hearts is a must.",1303862400,9,806,4.050314465408805
8427645,5,B004ETVV6U,"This is a wonderful series! It is only subbed, but to be honest I LOVE the japanese voices. They fit so well, and the anime is Great!",1299888000,6,133,3.962962962962963
