8427249,3,B004EP44C2,"I liked the movie, it was better then I thought it would be, because when I saw that Master P was going to be in it, I was thinking then it must be a B-rate type of movie, but thank god that he only had a very small part. But I liked the acting of spider loc, even though I never heard of him. I mostly watched it because I like Ernest Thomas.
he is a great actor, and im amazed that he allowed the world to really get a look at his bad eye, which by the way, he is blind in it in real life.",1372636800,,491,3.5981308411214954
8427250,1,B004EP44C2,Don't waste your money.  You're better off looking at the trailer which was why I purchased it in the first place.  Ernest Thomas doesn't speak in the entire movie and the story line sucked!!!! What a dispointment -- I can't even give this DVD away.,1351900800,,249,4.511111111111111
8427251,4,B004EP44C2,"CJ Tillman (Spider Loc) has spent most of his life in prison. He is a 2 strike felon and manages to get out on parole. He really wants to go straight so he can be with his daughter and baby momma. Through a church he has been able to get a sponsor to take him in and a job as an auto mechanic. His life with the Henderson couple seems a bit bizarre. Royce Henderson (Ernest Thomas) is a stroke victim cared for by his wife Mable (Candy Ann Brown). She has a weird love-hate relationship going with CJ. CJ is troubled by dreams and has an over active imagination that borders on hallucination.

The mystery has a Hitchcock-like quality to it, but falls short of the master. Spider Loc's acting leaves something to be desired, and the rest of the cast wasn't overly impressive. There is a bedroom scene with the Hendersons where the boom mike is visible, a rookie mistake for Sal Martino.

The movie is worth a view. The twist was perhaps light and predictable to seasoned mystery-thriller fans. It is nice to see something coming from the African-American community that has some smarts outside of gangs, sex, and drugs. Sal does get an ""A"" for effort.

Parental Guide: Heavy f-bombs, n-word, sex, no nudity.",1340496000,2,1207,4.527522935779817
