6014606,5,B00FMGPVCO,This show owns the very essence of my childhood. ;) I watched it again for sweet memories. This show is gold compared to the crap they show on nick today. I have a feeling they will bring this show back on the air. I mean why else will they be making this box set ten years after the show? It hasn't been on tv for six years. :) let us all hope. Purchase Today ! Bring back the ghost we love the most!,1391385600,23,401,3.8433734939759034
6014607,4,B00FMGPVCO,"I left a review earlier today saying that several episodes were missing from the DVD set. This was incorrect. Every episode is included; I didn't realize that some of the DVDs have several pages on the menus. The discs are labeled in am inconsistent manner and each DVD menu is organized differently, which led to my confusion.

Some of the season 2 episodes are out of order, but every episode is included in this DVD set. The visual and audio quality of the episodes are good. I recommend this set, as it's the first real complete set of Danny Phantom episodes on DVD.",1391126400,8,570,4.533980582524272
6014608,5,B00FMGPVCO,Danny Phantom is just about the best series on Nick. It being on a DVD complete series is amazing! I am looking forward to watching it!,1387929600,5,135,4.230769230769231

6014656,5,B00FMGPVCO,"The 5 stars are for the show, because I absolutely love it and have ever since I watched it when I was younger. Great characters, story, and comedy.

As for this product, I would probably give it 3-4 stars. I was bingeing the show and got through season 1 with no problems. The quality is good and all, but then I started season 2 and promptly discovered that the episodes are all out of order. You have to go back and forth between disks if you want to watch them in the correct sequence (I'm using wikipedia for the episodes list). I'm a little disappointed because it makes watching it kind of tedious now, but I'll muddle through because the show is worth it. I'm not sure how season 3 is as I haven't gotten there yet.",1512604800,,723,4.2773722627737225

6014660,5,B00FMGPVCO,"One of my favorite cartoons about ghosts et al after ""The Real Ghostbusters"" and ""eXtreme GB"" to get. Butch Hartman's series I wish he would bring back. An interesting concept that captivated me along with loads of humor. Though it still can get serious at times. If you like ghostly action cartoons  then this is for you. And at a good price for 3 full seasons.",1508889600,2,362,4.484848484848484
6014661,3,B00FMGPVCO,"Danny Phantom is honestly one of the best shows that was even on Nickelodeon. But this dvd collection really leaves things to be desired. First of all theres no subtitles. So as a person with hearing issues this means I am required to crank the volume up very high in order to actually hear. Disrupting my roommates and neighbors. Secondly while the quality of episodes is great, no stuttering or sound desync the order is extremely messed up. S2 E1 isn't found until disk 2 of season 2. And all the other episodes are similarly messed up.",1508457600,3,539,4.56701030927835

6014678,5,B00FMGPVCO,"The series is great and I'm happy that I can get all of the episodes now.  There are some out of order, 1 in season 1 and several on season 2.  Just make sure to consult with the wiki if you want to watch them in the correct order.  I've watched them about 2 and 1/2 times through now.  My brothers keeper and maternal instincts are still some of my favorites from season 1.  Well worth the purchase and a great way to listen to the theme on repeat in stunning quality.  You should get it and share this awesome series with someone you know.  #GoGhostAgain",1500681600,,556,4.188679245283019

I thought there was just a mistake with the product, but I saw in the specifics that there are 9 CDs packaged. I counted and there was 9. They literally took out a whole DVD. Five whole episodes are missing. The Season 2 episodes aren't even in order. Season 2 did not start with the Reign Storm episodes, it started with the episode where Sam wishes she and Danny next met, and Danny gets his logo! The rest of the episodes are out of order too!",1499731200,,525,4.0576923076923075
6014681,4,B00FMGPVCO,I'm only giving this set four stars because the episodes in season two are able out of order. If you want to watch them in order you have to jump around the disks a bit. Season one and three are fine though.,1499126400,,207,3.9523809523809526

I love that I can watch this on demand now! The packing was okay, I had no cracks in the case like I read in other reviews. There is no episode list but I can just look that up online if I needed to. The episodes are in good condition too, just as they looked on T.V when they first came out. I have been watching this since I was little (now 19) and I love that I can rewatch them all whenever I want. I actually got my mother hooked on this. :)",1496620800,,460,3.7422680412371134

6014697,4,B00FMGPVCO,"I've been a fan of the show since it came out when I was young and getting to be able to own it, as well as share it with others has been wonderful. It has stood up pretty well to time, though there are a few things that leave it dating itself. My biggest fault with it is that some of the episodes are out of order, and while it's only a few episodes listening to them reference things that haven't happened yet can leave anyone that hasn't seen the show yet confused.",1490572800,,469,4.053763440860215
6014702,2,B00FMGPVCO,"I was excited to receive this. I've been an fan and had wanted to watch all the episodes again. I'm disappointed though. The plastic packaging around the case was torn when I opened my box, which wasn't to concerning. However, when I started hearing the case rattle I didn't think that was a good sign. As soon as I opened the case, I realized it was broken. Not just cracked a little bit, but broken and not holding the disks in place anymore. I also have no pamphlet guide for the episodes which I assumed it should have come with since there are little clips in the left side to hold it, but there is nothing. The DVDs seem to be in good shape which is a plus, but over all the whole case is just destroyed.",1490486400,4,710,4.189781021897811

If you're like me and like watching episodes of TV shows in order than I suggest following the episode on IMDb or Wikipedia as they list the episodes in order.  Other than those problems, I absolutely love Danny Phantom still to this day.  I was obsessed with it when I was a kid and I even had a crush on Danny.

Sometimes other DVD cases do that, its no big deal, just don't drop it or let your 1 yo nephew hold it... Also the order of the episodes is off by one DVD, at least for me it was. In season 2, the first DVD had episodes 2-5 I think and episode 1 was third on disc 2 right after episodes 6-7, which I thought was weird, but whatever as long as its there, I guess.

I know some people have said the episodes are out of order from their original air date but that doesn't bother me as I never saw them in order on TV and I honestly didn't notice any problems with the order. It all makes sense so, I wouldn't worry about that damaging your enjoyment.

6014821,5,B00FMGPVCO,"I've been a Danny Phantom fan for a long time, and I'm glad it finally gets a Complete Series DVD. This is my review of the Danny Phantom Complete Series.

The story is about a 14-year old boy named Danny Fenton. His parents are ghost hunters and they built the Fenton Portal, a portal that leads to the Ghost Zone. They try it out, but it doesn't work. Danny's friends, Sam Manson and Tucker Foley convince him to go in the portal(It was mostly Sam who convinced him). Danny goes in and accidentally presses the green ""On"" button in the portal and gets zapped, causing his molecules to get all re-arranged and now is a half-ghost superhero named Danny Phantom. I like the animation a lot, but sometimes there were animation errors(Danny's eyes being blue in ghost form instead of green sometimes). My favorite part of the animation is the title cards. Each episode has a different title card unique to the episode. The acting is also really good and top-notch. I like this DVD, but I had a few problems with it.

The first problem is the episodes aren't in aired order. I think they're in production order(One of a Kind was the 3rd aired episode but the 2nd production episode, so it's episode 2).

The second problem I had was the case. It's nice but it doesn't look like it can hold all the discs. Some reviews I saw said that the case breaks really easy but it wasn't broken for me, but it looks like it'll break easily.

The third problem, I don't think this is really a problem, but there aren't any bonus features sadly(AKA voice actor interviews, concept art, alternate languages).

But this DVD is for any Danny Phantom fan!",1438992000,2,1633,4.522033898305085

Its nothing major I guess to complain about, but it'd be nice.

He enjoys seeing all the different ghosts and Danny getting rid of them. It's not his favorite cartoon though. I'm pretty sure he would give it five stars if he could. I'm giving three stars though because the characters are extremely labeled. There are also some jokes that are not appropriate. One that really stood out to me was when they needed a device at night and ordered it. Made a phone call and a girl on a bike delivered it. One character said something to the delivery girl along the lines of, ""You mean to tell me you have access to highly advanced technology this late at night?"" she replied yes and he said, ""what else can you do this late at night?"" She looked at him angrily. It was definitely something that could have been left out. There isn't a ton of things about the show that bother me, but that did. If you are buying it for a child its a good cartoon but there is a few ""jokes"" that really shouldn't be in a childrens cartoon.",1414281600,,1086,4.2009569377990434

6014888,5,B00FMGPVCO,"First off, I want to say I absolutely LOVE Danny Phantom and it is by far my favorite cartoon of all time (can't really explain why - it's just that good). It's unique, action-packed, and comedy all rolled into one show. The main characters are relatable, having real high school problems, as well as other-worldly problems. Overall, great show for kids, and adults who are young at heart =)

Now for my review of the DVD. Love the packaging, cover and disc arts, and it does in fact have ALL 53 episodes (that includes a count of 2 episodes for each double episode). The discs appear to be taken straight from the earlier released single season sets, but as long as all of them are there, it works. As others previously mentioned, the set does not include an index of the episodes included so I decided to go through all the discs and make my own. And for the people questioning the correct order of the episodes (based on air date) the number in parentheses next to the episode title states where it should lie in the season's order.

I'm just going to make a list of episodes and tuck it nicely inside the DVD case. Otherwise, if you love Danny Phantom, it's a good thing to have :)",1402531200,,492,4.135416666666667
6014890,5,B00FMGPVCO,"Grabbed this at Wal-Mart a few months ago. Hard to believe that I ordered all three seasons here on Amazon using the burn-on-demand service but a few years ago. For the record, my review's title refers to both the story content (a classic superhero coming-of-age tale) and the immense fan-base this show has acquired over 10 short years, despite it being cut short at 53 episodes over 3 seasons, all of which are presented here over 9 discs and with picture and sound as crystal-clear as their original air-dates (including a quartet of 1-hour movies - I still don't see the logic in splitting ""Reign Storm"" in half for the home video release).

If you've seen the whole show back-to-back but can't quite get enough, I recommend heading over to krossan.deviantart.com and checking out the fan-comic ""Legendary Destination"", a thrilling sequel to the series and an excellent follow-up to one episode in particular: ""The Ultimate Enemy"". For those of you eager to get your feet wet in what should be considered the crown jewel in Butch Hartman's magnum opus, here's the synopsis:

""Butch Hartman brings the darkest, most adult story ever told on Nickelodeon to life as Danny Phantom comes face-to-face with his own worst nightmare...

""While studying for the Casper High Career Aptitude Test, Danny (David Kaufman) is subjected to a series of ghost attacks that land the test answers in his hands and eventually send him, Sam (Grey DeLisle) & Tucker (Rickey D'Shon Collins) forward through time - into a future where, after the tragic deaths of everyone the young half-ghost hero holds dear, Danny has forsaken his humanity and become the most evil ghost on the planet (Eric Roberts), unleashing a 10-year campaign of terror that leaves Earth and the Ghost Zone on the brink of annihilation and the blood of millions on his hands. To that end, one of the Ghost Zone's leading governments, the Observants, have tasked Clockwork (the late David Carradine), the Master of Time, with killing Danny and preventing that future from coming true.

""But all might not be lost for Danny when he receives help from the most unexpected source: his sister Jasmine (Colleen O'Shaugnessey), the only one in his family who knows the truth about him. Armed with this knowledge, he must return to the past, confront his inner darkness and take back control of his destiny.""

For all its dark points, TUE marks not only a major turning point for Danny, but a monumental one concerning his relationship with his sister: after the events of Episode 9: ""My Brother's Keeper"", Jazz firmly believed that Danny would come to her and tell her the truth about his powers; only when she realizes that he's in more trouble than she first suspects does she make the decision to tell HIM that she knows about his powers. Let me tell ya, that revelation on the school stoop and the hug that followed were a long time coming.

If you love both this show and the STAR WARS Saga (like I do), keep your eyes peeled for these shout-outs to the Galaxy Far, Far Away...:

- Maddie's staff in Episode 16: ""Maternal Instincts"" bears a striking resemblance to Darth Maul's daul-bladed lightsaber from The Phantom Menace

- The architecture of the future Amity Park in ""The Ultimate Enemy"" calls to mind Coruscant, the Republic/Imperial capital planet, as first depicted in Return of the Jedi (1997 Special Edition) and throughout the Prequel Trilogy

- in Episode 46: ""Urban Jungle"", Danny confronts Undergrowth (voiced by Mark ""Luke Skywalker"" Hamill) and recuperates in a defrosting tank (looks kinda like the bacta tank from The Empire Strikes Back, doesn't it?)

- In ""Reality Trip"", Danny uses a combination of the Reality Gauntlet and the Jedi Mind Trick to get the Guys in White to back off his family (Obi-Wan Kenobi first used the JMT in A New Hope)

The show also has nods aplenty to Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Men in Black and Scooby-Doo, but saves the biggest of all for Spider-Man, from which the series draws much of its influence.",1401494400,,4009,4.837956204379562

Even though I'm in my 40's I've always loved cartoons! From Super-friends in the 80s' to Dexter''s Laboratory in the 90's. And in the 2000's from Kim Possible to Danny Phantom.

Being a voice actor my self I am always trying to voice match or mimic some of the characters in the show.

My favorite episode of Danny Phantom is ""Fanning The Flames"" and ""Planet Phantom"" being 2nt.

I just wish that the show had MORE episodes for fans to watch.

About the only thing I didn't like about this complete series DVD package is the way it's in the DVD case. The only thing holding all the DVDs together is a single plastic knob. The center fell apart already.

If you remember the series Danny Phantom you're going to LOVE this DANNY PHANTOM - Complete Series DVD collection!",1394582400,4,904,4.4817073170731705
6014906,4,B00FMGPVCO,"I doubt that I will be saying anything new here, but the Danny Phantom complete series is an amazing value. The show itself is a really good all-ages action/adventure cartoon full of great characters and funny humor. Though the premise involves ghosts, there isn't anything really scarey, so younger viewers shouldn't be a problem. This set includes all 53 episodes from the series, which is why I say it's an excellent value because you not only get a great show, you get it (as of this review) for the price of only $20!

The only flaw I could really find with this product is that the episodes are not in the order that they aired on television, but instead in their production order (the order they were made). Though this isn't a problem in either seasons 1 or 3, it is a problem in season 2 because several events occur during the course of the season that need to happen in a certain sequence to make the most sense. Unfortunately the production order doesn't show those episodes in that way, so it can be a little annoying. This is doubly frustrating because in my humble opinion season 2 is the best season of the show. Personally I looked up the correct order online and watched them the way they were meant to be seen, but you can't really expect a child to do that (though to be fair a child probably wouldn't care as much about the mis-ordered content).

Anyway, despite the unfortunate (and rather glaring) flaw stemming from the season 2 episode order, this product is still a great value and easily worth the $20 price tag. I would encourage any fan to pick this up, not only because it's cheap but because I doubt a better set will come along anytime soon.",1394496000,2,1673,4.5
6014907,5,B00FMGPVCO,My daughter has autism and certain things are entertaining enough to her that she will watch them over and over.  This series is one of them.  We ordered this series of DVDs 3 months ago and she is still keeping them in with her favorites.  The order arrived before we expected and was in great condition.  I couldn't be happier with these DVDs.,1393977600,2,345,4.428571428571429
6014908,5,B00FMGPVCO,"First off, I love the Danny Phantom series! It's really an awesome show!

So! About the DVD collection, it's really great. There are nine DVD's total. Each of the DVD's have cover art of the main characters (Danny, Sam, Tucker, Jazz, Vlad, and Skulker). They're organized neatly chronologically by season, as though you would flip through a book. Also, there is art within the DVD case cover.

So about the the DVD's themselves. When you first start them up, the Danny Phantom theme song starts up and then fades into the menu where you choose what episodes you want to watch, there are 5 episodes per disc (some DVD's have 6 with the movie episodes)

The quality is amazing. It's like watching it HD, when is is nice sight for sore eyes. I've watched the episodes from the beginning to the end of the series and what I really enjoy about this collection that everything is 16x9 in fullscreen. It doesn't distort or elongate the images of the episodes; it just feels like you're watching a regular 4x3 episode, just updated to fit the new standard of 16x9 TV's. Also, I watched these DVD's on a regular box TV (4x3) and they look and play just fine without the image being distorted. Mind you! This goes for ALL the episodes, which really surprised me since the 16x9 conversion didn't happen til' later, I would assume a lot of the earlier episodes would have been squared (4x3) rather than fullscreen 16x9.

However, this doesn't bother me, but I thought I mention for people looking to buy this, there are no subtitles, no alternate languages audios, and no extras (ex. interviews, artwork...etc.)

Anyways! I'm still very satisfied with this purchase. Over all! Great DVD collection for the collector of Danny Phantom memorabilia.",1393891200,19,1733,4.763333333333334
6014909,2,B00FMGPVCO,"I'd like to preface this by saying that, I love Danny Phantom. It was my favorite cartoon in middle school, and when I found out there was going to be a complete collection, I was ecstatic. But this box set is disappointing on nearly all levels.

1. Episodes are out of order. Nearly all of the season 2 episodes are presented in production order, not air date order. so the chronology of the story is missed on new viewers.
2. 9 discs? Really? For the big complete collection set, you couldn't repackage the whole thing and cut down on the disc count?
3. No bonus material at all. There are no commentaries, no interviews, no concept galleries, nothing.
4. 2-part episodes are separated. When the episodes were originally aired, they were kept an hour long, now they are separated.

All in all I feel that there was more time put into the wrap-around inside cover than the actually content of the discs. Which I will admit is nice. But the thing is, when Netflix had the license, they had all the episodes in order, and kept 2-part episodes one hour long. Bottom line, Netflix should get the license back because they did it right, or at least there should be an updated box set. This is especially disappointing after Shout Factory did an amazing job on the Transformers sets. Bottom line, this is a step in the right direction, but two steps back.",1393718400,5,1350,4.551440329218107
6014910,4,B00FMGPVCO,"This is one of the best series I have in my DVD collection. I didn't give it five stars because around the 3rd season, the episodes go out of order. Other than that, awesome purchase!",1393632000,,183,4.257142857142857
6014911,4,B00FMGPVCO,"Just to let you know, I've been a fan of Danny Phantom since it first aired in 2004 and I believe the show holds up remarkably well after ten years. When I heard that Shout Factory was releasing the entire series on DVD, I was really excited. After watching every episode, I'm glad I bought it, but it does have its share of flaws.

First off, all but the Season 2 discs lack closed-captioning, but that's nothing compared to the next problem: some of the episodes are out of order. Seasons 1 and 3 are fine, but Season 2 is the biggest problem. If you want to watch the series in order, I suggest looking up the list of episodes on Wikipedia and you're good to go. Also, I think it might have been convenient if there was a DVD guide listing all episodes on each disc, that way if someone wants to watch a certain episode, the guide would tell them.

Other than that, I really recommend this for fans of the show, or anyone who hasn't watched it and is interested. Once again, I am thrilled that one of my favorite shows from my childhood is finally released on DVD in its entirety.",1393113600,3,1083,4.278048780487805

I like the design and all the discs are there, but I was hoping Season 3 would be better video quality like season 1 and 2.  Unfortunately, it seems to have the same quality as that on Amazon, which I'm disappointed by (at least Eye for an Eye does, I haven't checked the others).

But this set has 2 major issues.

First, many of the episodes are wildly out of order. Some are in the completely wrong season.

Second, 3 episodes are missing from the set: Kindred Spirits, Double Cross My Heart, and the hour long special Reality Trip are all absent.

This box is still a heck of a value but buyer beware, it has issues!",1392422400,14,502,4.040404040404041
6014915,4,B00FMGPVCO,"I love Danny Phantom and had a bootleg version of this collection I bought from ioffer ages ago since nothing official was announced.

Now I looked over every disc when I got this in the mail and compared the list order to the Wikipedia episode air dates. I found season 3 is perfectly in order and they say 52 episodes for this as opposed to 53 like Wikipedia says because the final double episode movie special called ""Phantom Planet"" is counted as 1 long episode on the DVD (confusing I agree since ones like Ultimate Enemy as considered as 2).

Anyway the reason the episode order gets messed up in several discs in Season 1 and 2 is because if you check the same Wikipedia episode list you'll see the episodes have a different number order for production. The DVDs follow the production order not the airing number order (annoying and stupid I agree). So for anyone complaining about that issue, now you understand why it happened and happens with other shows.

Overall the menus take like a minute to get into and the format is full screen with no subtitles and no way to fix either issue. But for the price, this is a great collection of the series. Just do what I did and print out the proper episode list and make a note which disc to find which on.",1391904000,62,1258,4.413793103448276

14-year old Danny Fenton has a good life, a good (if eccentric) family, and the most loyal friends anyone could ask for. His physicist father has spent most of his life studying the Purgatory-like ""Ghost Zone"" and even building a prototype portal to access it. However, a freak accident upon it's activation causes it to open and close at random, releasing it's denizens into our world. Fortunately, for us, the same explosion gave Danny ghostly powers (flight, invisibility, walking through walls, etc.) and now, its up to Danny, his techie buddy, and his moody girlfriend (although they aren't ready to use *that* word just yet) to keep the world safe, and to get through freshmen year in one piece. I will never complain about my school years ever again!

I loved this show from beginning to end! The animation is stellar, the writing is crisp, clever, and guffaw-inducing, the voice acting is believable and compelling, and I can't say enough about the characters themselves. The villains themselves are alone worth watching for; most of whom would give the Avengers a run for their money: a Boba Fett-like mercenary, an overzealous genie, a glam rock chanteuse with hypnotic powers, cryokinetic Yetis, an Esperanto-speaking werewolf, a dystopian future version of Danny himself, a General Zod-like mad scientist with identical powers to Danny, and the ""Box Ghost"" (Don't ask) Just watch this show!",1529107200,,1649,4.971014492753623
