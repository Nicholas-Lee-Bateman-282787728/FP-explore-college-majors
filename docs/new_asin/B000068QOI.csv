1726103,3,B000068QOI,"WWE Judgment Day is the pay per view that i belive was the offical end for the WWE ""attitude"" era and began a decline that still is going on within the overall WWE product in general. The pay per view was duuring a crucial time for WWE, as it was coming off subpar efforts at both Wrestlemania in march and Backlash in april. Instead of pushing new stars into the main event picture, WWE decided to put the WWE title back on Hulk Hogan at Backlash, which proved to be a major mistake and set the tone for the rest of 2002. The card featured Hulk Hogan vs Undertaker in one of the most embarrassing WWE title matches ever, a slow plodding brawl that put the crowd to sleep within 5 minutes of the contest, Taker by this time had no business in the main event picture and Hogan didn't help matters. There are some highlights however, the Hair vs. Hair match with Kurt Angle vs Edge was a great match, with Angle once again proving why he is the best overall performer in WWE as he again carried Edge to a classic. The other highlight is the IC Title match between RVD and Eddie Guerrero, who got the pay per view off to a great start and features great technical wrestling as usual by Guerrero. HHH and Y2J had an ok hell in the cell match, however in typical HHH fashion, he gives Jericho pretty much ZERO offense and pretty much ended any credibility Jericho had left, way to build new stars HHH! It is worth chcking out for the 3 above mentioned matches, however the rest is filler and the main event is one of the worst main events in WWE history. A quick note, this was the first official pay per view under the WWE name",1141430400,4,1623,4.255663430420712
1726104,4,B000068QOI,"i bought this dvd for 8 dollars at wherehouse music and it is amazing, the hell in a cell match ive wanted to see for so long, heres how it goes

IC title match: Eddie Guerreuo (c) vs. RVD 8/10- this was a preety good match cause when you put these two together it makes gold. they would go on and have an even better ladder match on raw two weeks later which can be seen on the eddie dvd.

Womens title match: Trish Stratus (w/Bubba ray Dudley) vs. Stacy Keibler (w/ Revon D-Von) 5/10- nothing really exciding in this match except for at the end when d-von and young batista put bubba through a table

Hardy Boyz vs. Brock Lesnar & Paul Heyman 8/10- im always entertained by a hardy boys match, and brock lesnar is a freak man

Stone Cold vs. Ric Flair & the Big Show 8/10- again im always entertained by a stone cold match or a ric flair match, and big show was a good addition to the match as well. but it could have been better

Hair vs Hair Match: Edge vs. Kurt Angle 9/10- very good technical match, these guys are very good wrestlers. its funny you never would of thought that when angle gets his head shaved it would be his look for the next 4 years

Hell in a Cell: HHH vs. Chris Jericho 10/10- WOW, what a match, these guys really left in the ring and people always do in a HIAC match. i loved how the match ended on top of the cage

Tag Team Title Match: Rikishi & Rico vs. Billy & Chuck 7/10- ok match with a great dance by rikishi after the match.

WWE title match: Hulk Hogan vs. Undertaker 8/10- preety good match Hogan and taker almost always deliver in a main event enviorment and i think they did at this show

overall an ok PPV i give it 8/10",1133136000,2,1661,4.086153846153846
1726105,4,B000068QOI,"Nashville, Tennessee was the setting.  May 19, 2002 was the date.  WWE Judgment Day 2002 was the event.  Headlining the card is the WWE Undisputed Championship match.  Hollywood Hulk Hogan not only has the fate of the Undisputed Title in his hands, but the fate of Hulkamania as well, as the Undertaker challenges him for his precious gold.  But is the Undisputed Title all that the Undertaker wants?  The first Hell In A Cell match in almost two years takes place as Triple H goes one on one with Chris Jericho.  In a Hair vs. Hair match, Kurt Angle goes head to head with Edge.  In a handicap match, Big Show and Ric Flair take on Stone Cold Steve Austin in his final P.P.V. appearance.  Rob Van Dam tries to regain the Intercontinental Title from Eddie Guerrero.  Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman team up to battle the Hardy Boyz.  Billy and Chuck defend their Tag Team Titles against Rikishi and a mystery partner.  The WWE Women's Title is on the line as Trish Stratus fights off the challenge of Stacy Keibler.  Watch for both Dudley Boyz to get involved in this one.  Also on this DVD are interviews with a variety of WWE superstars.  Plus a bonus match from Sunday Night Heat as D-Lo Brown challenges William Regal for the WWE European Championship.",1038873600,,1253,4.556053811659193
1726106,5,B000068QOI,"Ok, this is a great PPV. THE HITC was great, the Flair match with Austin was fun..BUT There is no way this DVD is that rare! $100.00 to $200.00, give me a break! The MAX this should be is in the $40.00 range. I hope that WWE gets smart and decides to re-release this and thus kill the market for this old copy.",1165795200,2,310,3.9365079365079363
1726107,5,B000068QOI,"I was scrolling through here looking at WWE DVDs, just seeing if there were any old ppvs I might want, and I saw they were selling this for around $130, and that's just insane.  Yes this was a great show, however, the most I'd buy it for is 40 bucks, possibly 50.  Anyways, I thought I'd review this show because it seems like there isn't a decent review of the show, and some people are only posting about the high price it'll cost.  I haven't done a review in a while, so here it goes:

Intercontinental Championship:

Eddie Guerrero Vs. RVD

This was an amazing opener.  A lot of people only remember the ladder match these two had on Raw, where Rob won the IC title back.  I believe this pay per view was right before that episode of Raw.  Anyways, this match really proves that these two don't need a ladder to have a great match.  This was truly a great wrestling match imo, and one I wish a lot more people could see.  This match wasn't just high flying, it was more grounded to me, with even some great submissions work, which you don't expect from these two together in a match, especially RVD.  ***1/2

Womens Championship:

Trish Stratus with Bubba Ray Vs. Stacy Keibler with D-Von

Eh, there isn't much to say about this match.  It was short luckily.  Trish did her best with working with Stacy, but Stacy still isn't much of a wrestler.  It was at least somewhat entertaining.  The only thing I really remember is Bubba being put through a table afterwards by D-Von and Batista.  **

The Hardyz Vs. Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman

If this match had been longer, I think it would of been better.  But given it was only around 8 minutes long at the most, I'd say they did a decent job of the Hardyz looking like they gave their all and making Brock look unstoppable.  It seemed like a couple of times the Hardyz might actually win, however Brock was too strong in the end, countering a lot of the Hardyz high flying tactics, which was impressive to say the least when it came to showing his strength.  **1/2

Stone Cold Vs. Ric Flair and Big Show

This was a very entertaining match.  Stone Cold was really holding well on his own at the beginning, and of course the numbers caught up with Stone Cold eventually but he could still handle them on his own for the most part.  It kind of bugged me Show was in this match, since the feud was really between Flair and Stone Cold.  To some this match holds a bit of historic purpose, since this was Stone Cold's last PPV match for a while because of him walking out on the WWE.  Still a match worth watching.  ***

Hair Vs. Hair Match:

Kurt Angle Vs. Edge

A great match between these two.  These guys have had better matches during this feud, such as their match at Backlash a month before, or their cage match they had a few weeks later on Smackdown!, but still doesn't take away from the fact that this was a memorable match, mostly because this is where Angle got his head shaved (and wore that dumb wig for a few weeks).  These two nonetheless made it seemed like this match mattered to them in the ring and put on a tremendous effort of giving us a great match.  ****

Hell In The Cell

Chris Jericho Vs. Triple H

I've seen pretty much every HIAC match there is (except for Unforgiven 2006, which I'll see soon), and this is definately in my top 3 list for favorite HIACs.  It really bugs me how this is one of the least talked about HIACs, when these guys really made this a brutal and unforgettable HIAC.  These guys really needed to step up the brutality too because in almost all the HIACs before, someone always came off/went through the top of the cell.  These guys did some great things such as HHH swinging a chair at Jericho while he was holding a ladder, DDT through the announce table, a brutal (was that real barbwire?!) barbwired 2x4 shot to Jericho's head on the top of the cell, and of course the ending, a Pedigree on top of the cell.  Jericho's expression after that ending says it all.  Truly the match worth buying this DVD for.  Without a doubt their best match during their feud.  *****

World Tag Team Championship:

Billy and Chuck Vs. Rikishi and Rico

Boring match.  It was really pointless.  Rikishi was having a feud with B&C and Rikishi's secret tag partner was of course B&C's manager, Rico.  The ending to this match is pretty interesting, with Rikishi and Rico actually winning the tag titles, however it's still not enough to make you want to watch the entire match.  *1/2

WWE Championship Match:

Undertaker Vs. Hulk Hogan

This one is really tough to call.  I really think that these two tried to have a great match, but in the end it was just not working out that way.  The match was slow and had a good bit of botched spots, such as Taker's first Chokeslam on Hogan.  I was very impressed when Hogan hit that Superplex on Taker.  Add that with some of the great counters in this match, such as Taker countering the Leg Drop into a single leg crab, and I do believe these guys tried to have a good match, but like I said, it really wasn't working.  In the end, just like 10 years ago at Sur. Series 92', Taker pulled off the win and won the title.  **1/2

Also incase your wondering, the extras on this DVD are post-match interviews with the Hardyz, Bubba, and D-Von, as well as clips of HHH answering questions about his match and feud with Jericho on Byte This, and finally a Sunday Night Heat match for the European Championship with William Regal defending against D'lo Brown.  The DVD itself is definately worth checking out.  I'm sure it's impossible to rent, but if you can, go for it, and if you can buy it (at a decent price), I would definately recommend it.  I believe the only reason this pay per view isn't bigger in other peoples' eyes, and the reason most of these matches aren't really talked about, is only because you could only buy this DVD at WWEShopzone and no where else.  Luckily I bought it a few months after it came out at shopzone and haven't regretted it since.  Definately a memorable, important, and all around fantastic show in my eyes.  I really hope this review helped you guys and girls.  Take care.",1161043200,18,6130,4.385777777777778

1726109,4,B000068QOI,"Judgment Day 2002 could have been a really great ppv for the wwe... but it disappointed overall

for the people who want really good accurate reviews, it is me who will give it to you!!! i don't mess about like the really immature kids on amazon do!! they are retards who's opinions should be ignored!

1. WWE Intercontinental Championship Match: RVD vs Eddie (R.I.P)

this was a good match that had potential of being a  classic... fast paced match, but the ending killed it!!! still, i can watch this over and over without getting bored! Winner: Eddie (rating: 8)

2. Handicap match: stone cold vs big show & ric flair

this match could have been great, but way too slow!!! i realised after watchin this match that the time allocated to this was way too much! they should have given the RVD/Eddie match more time to develop! very boring match that needed more wrestling for the time that it was given! Winner: Stone cold (rating: 5)

3. Hardy Boyz vs Brock Lesnar & Paul Heyman

i've always liked brock lesnar and still watch the great wrestling clinic he and kurt angle put on at wrestle mania & summerslam.. also at vengeance... however this match showed his power and excellent wrestling he does.. however this match was a squash and he destroyed the hardyz... too short of a match! again, more time could have been taken from the stone cold match and given here... winner: lesnar & heyman (Rating: 6)

4. WWE Woman's Champions match: Trish with Bubba vs Stacy with Rev. Dvon

Pathetic, as all womens matches are... nice table spot with bubba though!! Winner: Trish (Rating: 5)

5. Hair vs Hair match: Kurt vs edge

brilliant match! they couldn't pin each other with their finishers so edge got the tights... good chemistry in this match! Winner: edge (rating: 10)

6. Hell in a cell match: chris jericho vs triple h

i consider this match better than the match later in the year at No Mercy... this was the last match where 2 wrestlers went on the roof! huge pop when triple h got the 2by4 wrapped in flesh-tearing barbwire! i watch this match a lot.. a brilliant match!!! has to be seen as this was the last cell where you will see action on top of the roof... and the match ends there! lots of weapons in this match! after seein jericho backdrop triple h on the roof you would wish the roof had collapsed like the No Way Out 2000 match..it would hav probably been the best or 2nd best hell in a cell if that happened... still very violent things here..... better than triple h & shawn at Bad Blood 2004! by far! Winner: triple h (Rating:10)

WWE Tag Team Match: billy and chuck vs rikishi & rico

waste of time! Winner: rikishi & rico (Rating: 5)

WWE Undisputed Championship match: Hogan vs Taker

I hate hogan with a passion.. he cant wrestle to save his life! i love the phenom, but he just couldn't carry hogan here... bad ending to this ppv.. poor taker had to have that old slob in a match for an important title...Winner: Undertaker (Ratin: 6)

Extras are alright, could have put more to save this ppv... 3 matches saved this ppv otherwise the rest were a waste of time.",1144540800,,3085,4.496415770609319
7964529,5,B000068QOI,"On May 19th, 2002, Judgment Day came to Nashville, Tennessee in what was bound to be an eventful night that was packed with a 5 star card. Not to mention that this was the absolute last WWF PPV before fully transitioning to WWE. So here's my review on this magnificent PPV

1.) Intercontinental Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero (c) vs RVD

I always loved watching guys like RVD and Eddie Guerrero go at it back in the day. Both guys with high flying and technical moves in their arsenal to make a great and solid performance for an opener. Guerrero and Van Dam had numerous encounters for the Intercontinental Title. The month before at Backlash and even their Ladder Match on Raw which seems to be the most memorable one for most fans. These 2 did not fail to disappoint (as if they ever did)

__________________________

A backstage segment with D-Von Dudley leading Batista, Stacy Keibler, and Vince McMahon in prayer before Stacy's Women's Title match against Trish Stratus. Funny segment with Vince lusting over Stacy's butt while prayer was going on.

__________________________

2.) Women's Championship Match: Trish Stratus (c) w/Bubba Ray Dudley vs Stacy Keibler w/D-Von and Deacon Batista

Nothing more than a grudge match after Stacy lost to Trish in a Swimsuit Competition on the previous Smackdown. Nothing special about the match itself. But who cares? Stacy and Trish looked absolutely beautiful in this match and Stacy's legs----oh man her legs! Trish hits the bulldog for the win. D-Von tries to reconcile with Bubba after the match but it's a ruse and Bubba gets put through a table by Batista and D'von

__________________________

A backstage segment with Vince walking in Flair's office and Flair telling Vince he was right about Steve Austin and that unlike Vince, he'll take Austin down.

__________________________

3.) The Hardy Boyz vs Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman

Brock Lesnar had been on a dominant role since coming to WWE and had taken out dozens of superstars and The Hardyz were next in line to feel his wrath. At certain points in the match, it almost looked as if Matt and Jeff were actually going to be able to topple Brock, especially with Heyman being involved, but that was not to be the case on this night. Lesnar and Heyman get the win after Heyman pins Jeff following an F5 from Brock Lesnar. Brock Lesnar's reign of terror would continue while Matt and Jeff would eventually go their separate ways. It'd be about another 4 years before The Hardyz teamed together on a PPV again

__________________________

A hilarious backstage segment with Booker T scoring with a woman and earning her hotel key. Booker acted like a high schooler, the first time he gets a date with his crush

__________________________

4.) Handicap Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Big Show and Ric Flair

Ever since Stone Cold had signed to Raw, he'd been making Ric Flair's life a living, miserable hell. Similar to how he made Vince McMahon's for the last 5 years, prior to the Draft. Same scenario, different authority figure. The storyline was grade A and had you wanting to see more every week. Although it wasn't as great as the Austin/McMahon feud, it was still great. The match was even better and was very solid and entertaining. I thought adding Big Show to the feud was a bit odd but I guess it made it less believable that Austin would win if it was just him vs Flair. An X-Pac interference near the end is not enough to keep the Rattlesnake from laying everyone out with Stunners and pinning Flair for the 1, 2, 3

__________________________

5.) Hair vs Hair Match: Kurt Angle vs Edge

Edge and Kurt Angle were two people who had a special chemistry with each other and honestly their feud with each other is extremely underrated. Whether it was the King of the Ring or Backlash, they never had a bad match with each other. This was probably one of the best and athletic matches from the two I've ever seen. Both men thwarting the other's toughest moves. This match went back and forth and had so many close calls that it almost seemed like either one of them had a chance of winning. Edge ends up getting the win but before he can shave Kurt's head, Angle makes a run for it, resulting in a cat and mouse chase.

__________________________

A segment at the Marriott with Booker T in the woman's hotel room, he met earlier. They cut the lights out and get ready to have sex but it's interrupted by Goldust who appears in bed with them to convince Booker to leave the NWO (yes Booker was a part of the NWO....for a short time, thankfully). Goldust reveals the entire thing was a scheme and a butt naked Booker bails out of the hotel room. VERY comical segment!

__________________________

6.) Hell In A Cell Match: Chris Jericho vs Triple H

Vince McMahon and Chris Jericho both still had a lot of built up resentment against Triple H over on Smackdown and to release all the bad blood with each other, Vince put Triple H inside the most dangerous match ever with Y2J; Hell in a Cell. This Hell In A Cell match has got to be one of the most overshadowed Hell In A Cell matches ever. I don't think people understand or appreciate just how vile this match got. This was better than Jericho and HHH's match at Wrestlemania and at Fully Loaded in 2000. This is pretty much where it all came to a head and neither of them held back to give fans less than A+. Everyone bled in this match, even the referee! A ladder, the steel steps, and even the 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire comes in to play in this match. A very brutal and underrated match that I'd place in my top 5 if not my top 3

__________________________

6.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Rikishi and Rico vs Billy and Chuck (c)

Rikishi went into this match with a mystery partner as chosen by Vince McMahon and it turned out to be Rico, Billy and Chuck's stylist! This was pretty much a Handicap Match. The crowd was dead for most of this match, which is understandable, after witnessing a killer Hell In A Cell match to this Tag Team match. Rikishi wins the match and he and Rico become the new Tag Team Champions. Nothing special about this match

__________________________

We go backstage to Edge looking for Kurt Angle. If you pay attention to the the first few seconds, you'll notice Billy and Chuck coming through the curtain in gorilla. Edge ends up running into Angle, who jumps Edge and takes him to the side of the entrance stage where the barber's chair is. Edge reverses an Angle Slam into a sleeper hold and Kurt is out like a light. Edge shaves Angle's head bald and leads the crowd in chanting ""You're Bald"" with his theme music

__________________________

7.) WWE Undisputed Championship Match: The Undertaker vs Hulk Hogan (c)

The premise of this storyline was pretty similar to the one Hogan and Taker had in the early 90s: Undertaker wanted to kill Hulkamania and the legend of Hulk Hogan for good. This was a fairly decent main event match from Hogan and Undertaker, renewing their feud from 11 years ago (at the time this match happened). The best thing about this match is that this wasn't 1991 when Hulk Hogan was a no-selling superhero and Undertaker was a no-selling demon. This was 2002 and we were able to see a fairly good match with not very much no-selling going on. Hogan used a few moves that I'm sure no one expected he could ever pull off. There were a few sloppy moves in the match and I'm not sure if they were accidents or Hogan legitimately not wanting to sell the moves. An interference/distraction from Vince McMahon + a chair shot from Undertaker + a Chokeslam gives Taker the pinfall victory over Hogan, thus putting an end to Hulkamania (for a week and then Hulkamania was resurrected....again).

__________________________

Overall: An A+++++ Judgment Day. How fitting that probably the best Judgment Day PPV is extremely hard to find on DVD....for an appropriate price that is. I understand that this PPV is OOP and very hard to find but the fact that Amazon is selling this for $300+ maximum is a bit ridiculous. You'd have a better chance of finding this on eBay for a lower price--but not much. Fortunately you no longer have to break your neck trying to look for this DVD because it's available for your viewing on the WWE Network!",1393718400,,8275,4.636798905608755
7964530,5,B000068QOI,"I just boght this PPV for $10 in mint condition from a used dvd store...now in looking at the prices on here ($140 for new, $60 used) i feel i got a heck of deal!!! its a great PPV, IDK if i would evere pay the price amazon is asking though...according to amazons prices, i could make a heck of a profit on this dvd if i was to ever sell it...",1300406400,2,343,3.7777777777777777
7964531,3,B000068QOI,"There is no point in going over Judgment Day 02 itself, its a decent event I guess.  The main thing to talk about when it comes to this DVD is its rarity.  The reason this DVD cost's so much is because WWE itself made a limited run of copies, and then only sold it on its website for a short amount of time.  Once it was sold out that was it, no more copies to be made, and once the collectors knew that, the demand for it increased, thus so did the price.

The average person doesn't know about this and thus thats why there is all the complaints about it.  I see where these people are coming from but as the saying goes; anything worth having is worth paying for.  So if you're aren't a collector of harder to find WWE DVD's its for the best that you don't pay such an outrageous price for something that should really only be about 15 dollars max.  If you are a serious collector though, then I don't need to tell you, snatch this up now as the price is only gonna get higher as the years pass.  Now WWE did the same thing with Vengeance 02, and it's almost as hard to find as JD 02, some may think its even harder to find, but these are the only 2 PPV's that WWE released as Shopzone (WWE Shop now) exclusives, thus the big demand, and high prices for them.

Someone mentioned in another review that Judgment Day 02 was the rarest of WWE DVD's.  This also isn't the case.  The rarest known WWE in the US is the FYE Exclusive version of the Trish Stratus 100% Stratusfaction DVD.  How rare is that DVD you may ask?  Well lets put it like this, its only gone up for auction 3 times on Ebay in the last 5 years.

Another WWE DVD that is rarer than JD 02 is the Raw Homecoming DVD that was packed with the slimline version of Wrestlemania 20 as a Walmart exclusive for a very short amount of time.

A couple more really rare WWE DVD's are the Circuit City exclusive 4 disc set of the Rowdy Roddy Piper DVD, and the FYE 2 disc collectors edition of the Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior DVD.  These DVD's like JD 02 command alot in way of price so if you really want them, be prepared to pay a good amount.

I will close by stating that WWE DVD's in general do not get enormous print runs, even the ones you come across often do not have millions of copies made like most big budget movies, so the DVD's they make that are rare are REALLY rare, and thats why you see such high prices.  Its a niche market with a serious collector communuity, so when you see those prices its those collectors who are gonna pay the money for them.",1288656000,4,2536,4.119918699186992
7964532,3,B000068QOI,"I have a big box full of old WWE DVDs. By old I mean like, 2001-2004, which I guess isn't that old, yet Amazon seems to think they're worth over $100. I stopped watching wrestling for a few years after around 2006, but I've recently found myself interested in it again, so I've been going through my old DVDs randomly.
I couldn't remember Judgement Day '02 too well, except for some memories of the Hell In A Cell match.

{WWE Intercontinental Championship}
Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Rob Van Dam

It's a shame that Eddie's passed on now, this match, among countless other ones he made memorable, really show how dedicated and talented he was.
This was probably one of the best matches on the card, and a good match to choose to open the show with. RVD is a good match with Eddie, both have styles that blend well with each other, both are great highflyers and technical wrestlers. RVD is particularly underrated as a mat based wrestler, which I think is shown a bit in this match, especially with his use of a Mexican Surfboard.
We don't get to see a frog splash land from either competitor, which is unfortunate but nevertheless, it's still a solid match. Eddie counters a spinning heel kick into a back slide and uses the ropes for extra leverage to win and retain the title. RVD would, however, win back the Intercontinental title in a ladder match on the following Raw.

****

{WWE Women's Championship}
Trish Stratus (c) w/ Bubba Ray Dudley vs. Stacy Keibler w/ Reverend D-Von and Batista

I didn't have what you'd call high hopes for this match. Don't get me wrong, Trish Stratus has always been one of the best female wrestlers in the WWE, but Stacy on the other hand has always been used as a valet or just plain ""eye candy"" more or less. I think that maybe if they'd given Stacy more ringtime and more chance to improve herself in the ring then she could've potentially been a lot better in the ring and been a legitimate contender for the Women's title. I mean, even Torrie Wilson and dare I say Dawn Marie were putting on better matches on SmackDown after being given more ringtime, but eh, back to the match.
Very average and short, I was expecting an altercation between Bubba and D-Von at ringside, but for the most part there wasn't much. At one point, Batista got involved and gave Trish a pretty vicious looking body slam which didn't achieve much. Trish managed to pick up the win after a sloppy bulldog on Stacy a few moments later, then left the ring retaining the title.
After the match, there was a short confrontation between the Dudleys which ended in Batista and D-Von double teaming Bubba, then flapjacking him through a table. Bubba Ray and D-Von would reunite six months later at Survivor Series as if this event never happened.
I guess this match is noteworthy for being the first pay-per-view appearance of Batista. It's interesting to see him here, starting out as a lacky for D-Von Dudley, then 3 years later he's main eventing Wrestlemania against Triple H.
Anyway, average match.

**

The Hardy Boyz vs. Brock Lesnar & Paul Heyman

Around Judgement Day was when Brock Lesnar was first starting to build some steam on his ridiculously fast and premature push to the WWE Championship, and it's evident that the writing staff are trying to put him over as a credible monster heel as soon as possible here, having him single handedly destroying the Hardy Boyz, one of the most popular tag teams ever in the WWE.
Despite The Hardyz getting some decent moves in, Lesnar never once looks weak or like he could ever possibly be defeated, which I guess is what they were going for, but in turn it made the Hardy Boyz look a little weak, especially with the fact that it was Paul Heyman who got the pinfall on Jeff.
Match was pretty short, and it would've been more enjoyable to see Heyman get a swanton.

**

{Handicap Match}
Steve Austin vs. Ric Flair & Big Show

Austin is always going to be one of the most entertaining wrestlers around, even if he hasn't wrestled since '03. Although I have to say that I think Stone Cold vs. Ric Flair or Stone Cold vs. Big Show just one on one would've been better to go with, but that's not saying that this was a bad match. It was entertaining, Austin didn't look weak or overpowered too much, but it still didn't take away any heat from Flair or Show.
I think for the most part in 2002, Big Show must've been really awkward for the booking team to place, and he seemed to be very much overlooked for the most part, he didn't appear at all at Wrestlemania 18, only made a few PPV appearances until he jumped to SmackDown and briefly won the WWE title. But here, I just couldn't help but feel that he was thrown in this match because they had nothing else for him to do. But that's just me.
It was a pretty decent match nonetheless, Stunners all around. Big Show got two stunners, then X-Pac (whom was with the nWo at the time, like Big Show) tried interfering, but got a Stunner for his trouble too, then Flair got a stunner of his own for Austin's win.
This was Austin's last match before leaving for the rest of '02, and his third to last match overall to date.

{Hair vs. Hair Match}
Edge vs. Kurt Angle

This was the match of the night in my eyes. Kurt Angle always puts on a great show from every aspect, and Edge has always been entertaining and a great wrestler in general. It never dragged, it wasn't overly one sided, and most of all, it was unpredictable. A match like that really could've gone either way.
It was Edge who ended up getting the win though countering the Ankle Lock into a small package for the victory.
Angle of course high tailed it, then the rest of the pay-per-view saw Edge chasing Angle around backstage.
Eventually, Edge and Kurt Angle brawled back out onto the stage, ending with Edge actually successfully using a sleeper hold on Angle to put him asleep. This is the only time I've ever seen a sleeper hold actually live up to its name.
He then shaved Kurt Angle's head, it's actually hard to remember Kurt with hair nowadays. Still, it was a great match and had a fun result with Kurt wearing a horrible wig the following weeks after Judgment Day.

{Hell In A Cell}
Chris Jericho vs. Triple H

This Hell In A Cell match seems to be fairly overlooked, and underrated. No it's not the most memorable Hell In A Cell like Undertaker vs. Mankind or as mindblowing as Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels, but it was still a brutal, enjoyable match.
It was unfortunate to see Jericho drop from the main event for the rest of the year after this, he had a great effort here. No, if I were to make a list of wrestlers who I'd like to see in Hell In A Cell, Jericho wouldn't be high up on there, but he did surprise and impress me.
The match ended up on the top of the cell, which is always awesome to see, especially when Triple H brought a barbed wire 2x4 into the mix which only made me think of his match against Cactus Jack two years before hand.
Triple H ended up winning with a Pedigree on top of the cell.
It was a great match, I'm not saying there's no room for improvement, but still, this match, along with the hair vs hair match, would be your main motivation in buying this DVD.

{World Tag Team Championship}
Billy & Chuck (c) vs. Rikishi & Rico

The point and placement of this match alludes me.
At the start of the match, Rikishi's mystery opponent (as chosen by Mr. McMahon) turned out to be Rico, making Billy & Chuck the odds on favourite. But then a very slow 4 minute match proceeded that saw Rikishi pinning Chuck Palumbo to get the win and become the new Tag Team Champion along with Rico.
This match was a time filler in every sense of the term. It would've been much better suited to SmackDown, or even Heat. And the fact it took place between a Hell In A Cell match and a heavyweight championship main event confuses me. The fans just didn't care about it and had no reaction to anything at all in the match.
Ideally, this should have been placed as probably the second or third match.
I give it two stars purely because I was surprised to see Rikishi win.

**

{WWE Undisputed Championship}
Hulk Hogan (c) vs. Undertaker

When Hogan returned in 2002, the WWE quickly ran him through all the top players in the WWE, losing to The Rock at Wrestlemania, then winning the WWE title from Triple H at Backlash, here he's defending the belt against the Undertaker.
Hogan will always be a legend, and will always be a huge draw. Decades after he first became popular, he's still one of the most famous and popular wrestlers in the world, so you put his name on a PPV and people will buy tickets and the pay-per-view. But that doesn't mean he's necessarily going to put on the greatest match.
This match seemed to struggle a lot, although both 'Taker and Hogan gave it a fair amount of effort, it just didn't really live up to the main event standard for me.
Undertaker hit with a Chokeslam for the win, with help from Mr. McMahon.
The problem with this is match that, not only didn't it completely deliver, it was also on a strange card.
Some people may disagree with me, but I think a Hell In A Cell match should always be the main event. That is more than likely what people are buying the PPV to see - Triple H and Chris Jericho beat the hell out of each other in a cell. Ideally, I would've placed the Jericho vs. Triple H as the last match on the card and Hogan vs. Taker right before it.
After the cell match, a lot of the fans just seemed to not be into it, and that awkwardly placed tag team title sham didn't help at all.

***

Overall, Judgement Day 2002 is a flawed pay-per-view that drags in some places, fails in a lot of places but still has moments of greatness that warrant buying the DVD.
I wouldn't spend the high amounts of money that are advertised here, it's worth maybe $20-$30 I'd say, but if you see it cheap, then yes, get it.
Rob Van Dam and Eddie Guerrero put on a great opening match to start the night, Angle and Edge have an excellent match, and Triple H and Chris Jericho's Hell In A Cell is highly underrated, so do yourself a favour and watch it for at least these three matches.
The show does fall flat with the undercard though, there are better divas in the ring for Trish Stratus to face than Stacy Keibler, the Hardy Boyz/ Lesnar & Heyman match could have been longer, better and with a not so disappointing ending and a completely different and better match could've been put in place of the Tag Team match. Or Rikishi could have at least been given a legitimate partner that wasn't Rico.

So yes, all up, if you happen to see this title somewhere cheap, then get it, but don't spend the massive prices that are advertised here.",1272412800,,10686,4.397974683544303

THIS VIDEO ISNT PRICED BECAUSE OF THE MATCHES, ITS PRICED BY AVAILABILTY. THERE WERE 2 RELEASES OF THIS VIDEO, ONE WAS HERE IN THE GOOD U.S.OF A WITH A PRODUCT NUMBER WWE59316 AND ANOTHER RELEASED IN CANADA WITH ""KOCH"" AS THE DISTRIBUTER. WHILE BOTH ARE RARE, THE U.S. RELEASE IS MORE RARE. IT WAS ONLY AVAILABLE ON [...] FOR A FEW DAYS, SO IF YOU DIDNT ORDER IT FROM THERE YOU DID NOT GET IT. THIS IS THE WWE'S RAREST DVD MADE, WITH QUANTIES LESS THEN 1,500 MADE.

7964534,5,B000068QOI,"D-Lo Brown VS William Regal: This is an extra match from Sunday Night Heat. It was a good, short match.

RVD VS Eddie Guerrero: Nothing to complain about this match, a very good match with a typical Eddie cheating to win ending but did not take away from the match.

Trish with Bubba Ray VS Stacey with Rev D-Von: A very short but enjoyable match, I never thought i'd say that about a women's match. D-Von and Deacon Batista put Bubba thru a table after this match.

The Hardys VS Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman: Just a match to put over Lesnar as a monster, sadly it's against talented Hardy Boys. I didn't think Heyman was part of the match but he was made part of it. Hardyz due get there licks in but they opt for Paul Heyman instead and got some shots in. Hardyz attack Heyman and allows Lesnar to rest and beat Hardyz and Lesnar tags Heyman to cover and pin Jeff.

Steve Austin VS Ric Flair and Big Show: Austin's last WWE PPV match was a dud. I remeber Austin/Flair on Raw when Austin couldn't use his fist and from what I remeber, that was a helluva match. This match had some good moments but I found it boring overall and the ending was stupid when X-Pac interferes and the ref doesnt call for the bell.

Kurt Angle VS Edge: I don't care for Edge but this match is plain awesome with many near falls and the ending was well done. It was one of the best matches i've seen in a very long time. Go out of your way and watch this match, I believe it's on Edge's WWE set. Thru the rest of the PPV Angle is running away so he couldn't get his haircut but Edge eventually gets him.

Chris Jericho VS Triple H Hell in the Cell: Alot of people seem to like this match but I thought it was boring for the first half of the match. Tim White keeps on telling the wrestlers to get into the ring and he seems pretty annoyed with the wrestlers. Jericho beats the ref up after he fails to make the count and this is where the match slowly turns the corner. The first half of the match sucked but the end was pretty good with Triple H pinning Jericho onto of the cell via pedigree.

Billy and Chuck VS Rico and Rikishi: Rikishi's surprise parter was Billy and Chuck's manager Rico. A very short match with Kishi and Rico winning the belts after a very weak looking kick from Rico by accident. They should have put this as an opener and not before the main event.

Edge finally catches up with Angle and shaves him bald

Undertaker VS Hulk Hogan: The beginning of this match was really good and Hogan even hit a superplex! Overall, I enjoyed this match and it wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. I will admit Taker's two chokeslams looked very weak though. Vince McMahon comes out and cost Hogan the match but I really didn't mind it.

Overall, a very good PPV overall. Alot of matches were entertaining and not really a bad match on the whole card. Hell, I even enjoyed the women's match! The dvd menu is hard to navigate but thats minor. A must own if you can find it for a decent price. I found it at my favorite record shop for like $[...]  used so i'm pretty estatic with my purchase.",1259280000,,3086,4.195945945945946

7964537,4,B000068QOI,"JUDGMENT DAY 2002 was a very significant event in WWE history.  It was the first-ever WW'E' pay-per-view, the 2nd PPV after the RAW/SMACKDOWN brand split, a ""sequel"" to the previous month's BACKLASH event, and a night that included all sorts of superstar trivia.  History aside, this 2002 edition was one of the few JUDGMENT DAY cards I enjoyed.  However, unlike most reviews where I just score a match, this time I'll discuss the unavoidable question: ""Is is worth the money?""

1) Intercontinental Championship
Eddie Guerrero (champion) v. Rob Van Dam
---The rematch from BACKLASH, where RVD lost his belt to Guerrero.  This was a solid opener between two athletes who never disappointed me.  Sadly, not quite as good as their BACKLASH or famous RAW Ladder Match from a few weeks later.  I found this encounter to be a little too one-sided for most of the match.  But if you decide to check this DVD out, you won't be disappointed.
""7.0 / 10""

2) Women's Championship
Stacy Keibler (w/ Reverend D-Von & Deacon Batista)
v. Trish Stratus (champion - w/ Bubba Ray Dudley)
---I don't usually type who accompanies wrestlers to the ring, but this time, having the Dudleys from different brands at ringside is just as important as the match itself.  First about the Divas match, it's nothing special, but I still enjoyed it.  It's fast-paced and fairly crisp by Keibler's standards.  But the real star of the show is the Dudleys' rivalry.  This was one of those average matches that didn't bother me at all.
""5.0 / 10""

3) Brock Lesnar & Paul Heyman v. The Hardy Boyz
---If you saw any part of Lesnar's WWE debut, you know what to expect.  If you've ever seen a non-wrestler compete in tag action, you know what to expect.  If you saw Jeff and Brock at BACKLASH 2002, you know what to expect.  Catch my drift?  Anyway, this wasn't anything special, but mostly entertaining.  Things were kept to a nice pace; since Brock was undefeated, the crowd was pretty immersed during the match.
""6.0 / 10""

4) 1-on-2 Handicap Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin v. Ric Flair & Big Show
---Talk about a strange scenario - The Texas Rattlesnake against the RAW GM and a giant member of a weird New World Order combo.  I'm not Austin's biggest fan, but I really enjoyed this one.  I think it was because he convinced me that one guy could take on these odds and win.  Handicap Matches tend to drag because of the two-man advantage, but everything flowed relatively well this time.  Quick side note: this was Austin's last WWE PPV for 9 months, because he quit just a month later.
""7.0 / 10""

5) Hair vs Hair
Kurt Angle v. Edge
---Everybody calls their BACKLASH showdown the Match of the Year candidate, but I actually prefer this one.  The hair-cutting stipulation adds more to the contest.  Also, I just found this one to be more intense and exciting.  Another neat touch is that the hair-cutting didn't happen afterwards.  The haircut didn't happen until after a few more matches, not to mention the victor almost ended up in the barber seat.  Sometimes when two guys pair up, you stop playing the comparison game.  With Angle and Edge, it doesn't matter which one you watch - it's gonna be awesome!
""8.5 / 10""

6) Hell-In-A-Cell Match
Chris Jericho v. Triple H
---In my opinion (and most reviewers' that I've read), Jericho/HHH at WRESTLEMANIA X-8 was solid, but disappointing.  We all seem to prefer this Cell Match, and for very good reason.  These two give each other a beating that gives their Last Man Standing Match a run for its money.  Like most of the great Cell Matches, things start off with some traditional wrestling.  But soon wrestling becomes a slugfest.  Then from the slugfest we got to ""cell wall"" spots, then onto the weapons, then to the outside.  I take the time to list these details because HHH and Jericho give each kind of ""fight"" sufficient time to build and deliver a sweet payoff.  This is often known as the ""forgotten Cell Match"", but it deserves to be remembered among the best of them.
""8.5 / 10""

7) Tag Team Championships
Billy & Chuck (champions) v. Rikishi & Rico
---I loved Billy & Chuck.  I thought Rico was a funny manager.  And I believe Rikishi was as underrated as they come.  The setup is that Rikishi's mystery partner was the champs' manager.  To be honest, these four guys are working their butts off the put on a solid contest, but the crowd just didn't care.  Sometimes I can ignore a harsh crowd, but this time I couldn't.
""5.0 / 10""

8) Undisputed WWE Championship
The Undertaker v. Hollywood Hulk Hogan (champion)
---This main event was a mixed bag.  To me, Taker and Hogan always had good chemistry.  I loved the storyline of Taker getting a shot at the man whom he won his first title from.  The crowd was crazy for this once the bell rang.  Also, Hogan pulled off a few moves I hadn't seen him perform before.  My big nitpicks are that the match is short, Hogan couldn't go as well as he used to (obviously), and the interference towards the end was getting silly after a while.  All in all, I kinda liked watching these two go again, but I think my nostalgia's getting the better of me.
""6.5 / 10""

OVERALL
---Should you buy WWE JUDGMENT DAY 2002?  Well, it's a pretty good card that includes a few goodies you can't find on DVD right now.  Taker/Hogan are on the TOMBSTONE: HISTORY OF UNDERTAKER DVD, but the other goodies have only been available on WWE 24/7 or On Demand from time to time.  The PPV flows well, and aren't any godawful stinkers.

I think the Amazon sellers' prices are a little high.  I've spent a lot of money on some hard-to-find DVDs, like VENGEANCE 2002 or the WWF WRESTLEMANIA DVDs.  But I don't think this one's worth quite that much.  It's just not a Must-See DVD.  Let me be clear: JUDGMENT DAY 2002 is a good PPV that rarely gets stale.  If you choose to dish out the money, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",1190764800,4,5885,4.546666666666667
