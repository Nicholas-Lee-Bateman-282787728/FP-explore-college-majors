8351776,5,B00262ZVKY,"I highly recommend this dvd for everyone, not just beginners. It is one of the most well thought out  and through beginner yoga dvd's that i have come across. It makes it easy for beginners to understand the basics of a vinyasa practice. Also, it  gives them an understanding of their bodies mechanics through a short anatomical section before each class. I think this dvd is also great for more advanced yoga practitioners to review proper alignment. I throughly enjoyed, and continue to enjoy,  this dvd and think it is essential to all who are interested in yoga.",1253750400,2,566,4.755102040816326
8351777,5,B00262ZVKY,"While I am a more advanced practitioner, this video is a great for revisiting the basics, while still providing a great sweaty work out and lots of information about anatomy and the reasons for doing each pose.  I highly recommend it for beginners and experienced practitioners alike.  I already got one for myself, my mom, and my sister!",1245196800,3,338,4.810344827586207
8351778,5,B00262ZVKY,"This is a great dvd for any beginners to yoga and really goes over the foundations of poses that are basic in all yoga classes (warrior 1, warrior 2, high lunge etc). You really work up a sweat holding each posture while the instructor explains how to correctly set yourself up in each pose and the physical benefits that each pose offers. The students who are demonstrating the class move slowly enough so that someone watching the video at home will be able to see what they are doing and copy them without having to stop and rewind several times just to get it. I like that the video offers adjustments/alternatives to poses that may not feel right for everyone. All in all, I think its a wonderful introduction to yoga!",1244332800,3,723,4.526717557251908
