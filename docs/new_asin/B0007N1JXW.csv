2221551,5,B0007N1JXW,"It is ironic that I absolutely loved a short list of Judith Krantz novels, but this was not one of them.  This is the rare time that the film was better than the book.

There are eight hours of storyline and a lot of stars to cover, so here is a top ten list of highlights:

1) Perry King played a real SOB, but at the same time he was very handsome and hot.  To see a young Perry King, check out the Lords of Flatbush with Sly Stallone.

2) Francesca Annis played a great matriarch with a fabulous voice and Euro accent.  No wonder Ralph Fiennes had a long-term involvement with her even though she was many years his senior.

3) Although I dislike both smoking and fighting, Barry Bostwick was hot with a cigarette dangling from his mouth as he taught a lesson to some thugs.

4) Valerie Bertinelli had a section of hair stripped to white when she pursued this role.  Both Zachary and Maxi had this trait in the book.

5) Thanks to this film I developed a bit of a crush on Adam Storke.  I'm not sure how he managed this as he was playing a gay character.

6) Jack Scalia once played baseball for the Montreal Expos.

7) I never have figured out the name of the actress who played Candace.  She broke my heart with her fine acting, vulnerability, and ultimate tragic demise.

8) This film triggered my appreciation for Ella Fitzgerald who sang the theme song with her fabulous smoky voice.

9) Doug Davidson from the Young & the Restless played a character that had no problem consorting with men or serving a jail sentence so long as the price was right.

10) Tim Daly was handsome in his role.  He played Joe in Wings.

This miniseries is a great escape into the world of the wealthy.  It was well-cast and the soundtrack was good.  It is essentially a soap, but soap can be a good thing.",1225065600,9,1792,4.28955223880597
2221552,5,B0007N1JXW,"I just adore movies like this! Mini series are so much fun to watch when they are made well, and this one is. Maxi {Valerie Bertinelli} gives you a charactor you'd just love to be. From the spoiled brat, to the resposible woman who comes out a winner all the way around. I first saw this on t.v. Never dreamed they'd make it into a dvd. I am so glad they did! It's a long movie but when I started to watch it...everything else went by the way side. I couldn't NOT watch it. Back then, you couldn't fast forward through all the commercials. Now I can pause it and get a pop or whatever and come back to my beloved movie. By all means buy this. That is if you love, love, intrigue,betrayal,happy endings, smart and dumb choices, and yet it all comes out GREAT!!! You couldn't ask for better.",1218844800,,789,4.231788079470198
2221553,5,B0007N1JXW,this tv series was fabulous.well acted especially valerie bertinelli.loved the story.im just so sad that this tv series is very hard to get. By Rose.,1218585600,,149,5.0
2221554,5,B0007N1JXW,I had taped this when it was on television and had worn out my tape. Couldn't find it on tv. My husband bought me the dvd for Sweetest Day. I love it. No commercials & I can watch it when I want. This is one of my favorite indulgences. Send my husband to the dirt track race & pop in one of my favorite chick flicks!,1196553600,7,316,3.803030303030303
2221555,4,B0007N1JXW,"This is a wonderful movie of human determination, love, passion, and betrayal.  It keeps you on your feet as the story is told switching back and forth from the past to the present.  Maxi (Valerie Bertinelli) is a very colorful and dynamic character.  Her ability to switch from a spoiled brat to a business woman gives her quite an insight into the real world.  Not having daddy to bail her out or anywhere to run after her failed marriages teaches her to grow up and to make concesions in life.  Rocco (Jack Sealia) one of Maxi's husbands has also a hand in her understanding the real world.  Maxi's determination in that her coniving uncle Cutter Amberville ( Perry King) does not destroy the magazine empire her father built and in not losing Rocco forever makes this a movie to watch.  All the actors are wonderful and you just love to hate Perry King.  All in all this is a movie to watch.  It raise many different emotions once you see it.",1172275200,12,946,4.485380116959064
2221556,5,B0007N1JXW,"Great drama of a wealthy family torn between greed, love and running an empire. Starring great actors like Barry Boswick and Jack Scialia and of course Perry King.....what more can you ask for?

An excellent plot that keeps you glued to the screen to see what will happen next.  This is a mini series made in the tradition when filmmakers actually knew how to make great mini series and compromised on nothing.

I saw this series on TV in the late 70's and when I saw that it was recently released in DVD I grabbed it.  It was so well made that I'll Take Manhattan (the catchy title) just remained a pleasant memory.

Make this great stylish production a part of your memory too and buy a copy.  You will not be disappointed and you will be spending some long hours on real quality viewing.  It's a PROMISE!!!",1162598400,22,809,4.425675675675675

2221588,4,B0007N1JXW,I like Valerie Bertinelli in this.  She has said she didn't think she did a very good job playing the part but I think it is one of her best.,1456704000,,141,3.7
2221589,5,B0007N1JXW,"I love the book as well as the movie.  Held my interest from the beginning to the end.  A classic story of a family and how they got started and formed their lives and started the company that Zach Amberville dearly loved.  Loved fiesty Maxi and how she fought for her father's company and to keep it all away from her father's brother.  He literally was not a nice and kind man.  He deserved what he got, both in the book and in the movie.",1455667200,,440,4.129411764705883

2221619,5,B0007N1JXW,"I saw this mini-series in 1984, and have never forgot the intrigue of it.  Part of it is a twisted love story.  Part is a woman proving she can make it in a man's world of business.  There is a murder that is discovered in a very strange way.  I loved the characters, each so different from the other.  I had told my husband that the best mini-series I'd ever seen was ""I'll take Manhattan"" with Valery Bertinelli.  Many other stars shine in this fast moving movie.  And, you can't help but love it, too.",1393977600,,504,4.242105263157895
