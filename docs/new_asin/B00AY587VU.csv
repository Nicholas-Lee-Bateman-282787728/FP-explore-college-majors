8559010,4,B00AY587VU,"My goodness! Two movies; two Blu-ray discs; great price.
IMAX movies are always under 45-minutes... no exception
here. The extras on these two features were almost as good
as the features, and ONE of the feature ""MAKING-OFs"" was
actually longer than the main program.
I watched both of these in 2D... only because I just hurt my
eye. Will be SURE to see them in stereo---soon---if the creek
doesn't rise... and my eyeball doesn't pop out!",1465603200,,438,4.776315789473684
8559011,4,B00AY587VU,"I am completely satisfied with some of the latest offerings
from IMAX that Image Entertainment is bringing to the
home 3D market.

After all, some of Image's initial offerings were pretty lackluster,
to say the least.  Dinosaurs Alive!, among their first IMAX
offerings, was so boring and badly produced for 3D that I
recommended enthusiasts keep their distance from it.
Fortunately, IMAX and IMAGE are back with a vengeance
offering up some new, well produced 3D fare.

Narrated by Donald Sutherland, Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia
is a fascinating film that focuses on the history, evolution
and extinction of the dinosaurs.  The documentary mostly fixates
on the region of Patgonia located in southernmost portion of
South America.  Whereas 700 species of dinosaurs have been
found, 10% of them have been discovered in this Argentina
region over the past 30 years.

We are introduced to Paleontologist Rodolfo Coria, who brings
us into the world of the largest known dinosaurs and some of
the great paleontological discoveries of modern time. Two of
the largest creatures to roam that landscape were the Argentinosaur
and Gigantosaur, remarkably recreated with CG technology to
lifesize proportions.

This IMAX feature is expertly produced, combining gorgeous
footage of the Patagonia landscape along with highly-convincing
computer generated renditions of monstrous dinosaurs that look
mostly realistic.  I say this because some footage looks more
believable than others.  At its best, the CG approaches the
complexities of what can be seen in Walking With Dinosaurs.
It's convincing enough that big kids should have the biggest thrills,
though despite the initial warning given at the start of the film, I
never felt that the subject matter would be too intense for the
small ones.

The 3D presentation is top-shelf.  With a sharp sense of separation,
you find yourself in yet another IMAX picture window journey through
gorgeous landscapes that look amazing in its dimensionality.  With a
crisp, well detailed 1080p transfer, you can't help but sit back and be
drawn into the panorama that immerses you.  There are lots of
sequences involving various species of dinosaurs both on the ground
and flying above.  You'll appreciate the 3D rendering that has these
creatures poking their noses out of the screen and hurdling small
rocks in your direction as a herd passes through .

Adding to the authenticity of the computer graphics is an
extremely active and effective soundtrack that takes
advantage of every single channel with its clever directionality.
Throughout the film, effects emanate across the entire
soundstage with precise clarity.  From the booming grunts
and growls of fierce meat-eating dinosaurs to the subtle
flapping of wings belonging to a pterodactyl, sounds are
extremely well defined and skillfully placed.  To top it
off there's a booming LFE track that had my subwoofer
vibrating the floor with every stomp of the 8-ton prehistoric
creatures.

CONCLUSION

There are plenty of reasons to recommend this title
as a worthy purchase.  It makes for the perfect family
3D presentation with repeated viewings coming from
kids and preteens who won't get enough of the dinosaurs.
Image has also sensibly priced this disc at well under
$20 which is the perfect price for a feature running 40
minutes in length.

IMAX continues to be the leader in taking you
places and introducing you to strange life with
its mind-blowing detail and stunning photography.
I am proud to write that Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia
stands as one of the best 3D titles in the Image library.",1453075200,2,3588,5.205217391304348
