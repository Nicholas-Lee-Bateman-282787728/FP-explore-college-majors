2719294,4,B000M2E32C,"These DVDs published in a bundle represent a good size cross section of Mary Ann Evans work. George Eliot was her pen name. She proceeded Jane Austen'l life and when I purchased these, I thought I might be getting more of the same type of viewing. This is not the case. All of these are dark and brooding, both in content and in film. They are unlike Austen in that the endings are not happy ones so keep this mind  when you buy them. Middlemarch and Mill On The Floss are the most interesting of the set and the most famous of the lot. Most of us took Silas Marner in school. To be fair, she is a great authoress. In England, her following approaches that of Jane Austen. There actually is a George Eliot organization which believes that she has not had the support that she deserves due the popularity of Austen. Very interesting period writing but keep a box of tissue nearby.",1218153600,3,879,4.359756097560975
2719295,4,B000M2E32C,After I had overcome the small product aspect I really enjoyed these. Not always the ending you want but she was a very talented lady and one comes away with the thought that much of the incidents are autobiographical,1197849600,4,217,4.589743589743589
2719296,4,B000M2E32C,"I enjoyed watching Middlemarch. It really shows how important it is for young people to choose the proper spouse. So many people get married for the wrong reasons and two of the main chaaracters suffer many years and have to give up their dreams and aspirations because they married self-absorbed people.

Daniel Deronda was my favorite film out of this collection. It also has a similar theme. People should be careful and marry for the right reasons, no matter what.

Silas Marner was a pleasant surprise. The main character is betrayed by all and even feels that God has betrayed him. The outcome is very interesting (I won't spoil it).

Adam Bede had a very important message, but the film itself was mediocre.

The Mill on the Floss was very good, captivating, and this story also had an underlying theme that forgiveness, love, devotion, and virtue are more important than anything else and that we should consider how we live and how we treat others because all that you have can be gone in an instant. In some ways, this film left me with a heavy heart.

Overall, a good collection.",1195257600,33,1090,4.68586387434555
2719297,5,B000M2E32C,My partner and I knew very little about George Eliot.  We found the collection to be a treasure.  Our favorites were Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda.  Mary Anne Evans was really a diamond in the rough!,1189987200,12,200,4.6571428571428575
2719298,5,B000M2E32C,"George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) penned many stories and all are worth reading. These wonderful performances do justice to her work. No expense looks spared and the locations are so atmospheric that it all adds to the strong story lines and character development. It is a collection of Victorian life studies worth owning. There is an additional feature called A Scandalous Life...guess who...talk about a woman with real courage...she lived her own life against all the constraints of her time which is hard to fathom in today's world of ""free everything"". Women lived confined...most authors of the day were men...women wrote romances, so Mary Anne created her ""George Eliot"" to be taken seriously. You will recognize many of the performers including Sir Ben Kingsley as Silas Marner. The price is great for the set...you won't be disappointed!",1183680000,90,844,5.1678832116788325

2719445,5,B000M2E32C,"What a beautiful collection. It has a few shortcomings. Patsy Kensit is badly miss-cast as Hetty in ""Adam Bede"" but Iain Glen is a wonderful Adam. ""Silas Marner"" is a bit too odd - though Ben Kingsley is a good Silas his ""seizure"" episodes are played just a tad too strangely, almost laughed on a few occasions. I enjoyed ""Mill on the Floss"" but it is such a sad story - Eliot was certainly well known for the ""real ness"" of her novels - there isn't always a happy ending but ""mill"" was just a bit too dark for me. The jewels are ""Middlemarch"" Brilliant cast, wonderfully filmed, just riveting. And ""Daniel Deronda"" for the same reasons. Romola Garai, Hugh Bonneville and Hugh Dancy shine. Well well worth buying. I wish the BBC would adapt more of the ""classic"" novels like this. Andrew Davies did 2 of the adaptations.

All are excellent productions by the BBC and were on my local PBS station and after viewing them I wanted to purchase them for my home viewing.  Finally, they have come out on DVD altogether in one box set which I bought just recently and am enjoying them again. Adam Bede was one of my favorites as it contains one of the heroines from BBC's Pride and Prejudice production and she is featured as the lay pastor preacher in Adam Bede.  Silas Marner is most memorable too as well as the other productions and I am so glad I made this purchase which is inexpensive as well as so vividly portrayed  by the BBC.",1350777600,2,716,4.409090909090909
2719510,5,B000M2E32C,"These five BBC films are wonderful. I am delighted that I was able to get all of them in one boxed set for such a low price. If you love period-piece drama, then you should love these films. However, some folks may complain at the lack of ""fairy-tale"" endings.

""George Eliot"" was the pen name of the writer Mary Anne Evans, one of the leading writers in Victorian-era England. She wrote seven novels, five of which served as the bases for the films in this collection: Adam Bede (from 1859), The Mill on the Floss (from 1860), Silas Marner (from 1861), Middlemarch (from 1871-72), and Daniel Deronda (from 1876). Mary Anne Evans used a male pen name because she knew, in those times, that a woman writer would never be published. Even her publisher initially thought that the author was a man. Queen Victoria herself was a big fan of ""George Eliot's"" novels and stories.

George Eliot wrote primarily about folks living in rural settings. Her novels are populated by diverse and very realistic characters. Her insights into personal politics (including the politics between men and women, men and men, and women and women) are quite astute. Her depiction of women is, perhaps, better than any of other fiction writer of her time. In short, she writes adult novels about adults for adults.

I read all of the novels (on my e-book reader) prior to watching the films. You can find all of the e-book editions here on Amazon. With one exception (discussed later) all of the films closely followed the novels. Middlemarch is my favorite film in the set. I suppose Middlemarch is considered to be ""George Eliot's"" best novel. I also love the story of Silas Marner (I even enjoyed the updated Steve Martin version), so I really liked this adaptation with Ben Kingsley (he who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the 1982 film Gandhi).

The five films in The George Eliot Collection are:
- Middlemarch starring Juliet Aubrey, from 1994 (420 minutes)
- Silas Marner starring (Sir) Ben Kingsley, from 1985 (90 minutes)
- Daniel Deronda starring Hugh Dancy, from 2002 (210 minutes)
- Adam Bede, from 1992 (102 minutes)
- The Mill on the Floss from 1978 (212 minutes)

While the production of Adam Bede was good overall, I was extremely annoyed with them for starting the film with a scene from the very end of the book. Perhaps they wanted to ""hook"" the audience immediately. When I was reading the novel (which occurred before I saw the film) I was surprised by the turn of events and the final outcome. The director should not have spoiled that kind of surprise by showing the audience (at the beginning) what was coming.

In addition, there should have been closed captioning because I couldn't understand half of what the actors were saying.  The sets were cheaply put together and it showed.  In one of the movies (I can't remember which one), there was a scene where a young man was at school taking a lesson from a fencing master and it was obvious that they learned the moves like dance steps and were counting how many times they were suppose to engage the swords.

2719547,3,B000M2E32C,"Having Read all the reviews prior to purchasing this set I was very excited to receive it and started watching the movies right away.  Wow was I disappointed.  Maybe I am just used to a different style of period dramas, but mostly I  was bored to tears while watching these.  I am also going to have to agree with the reviewer who said the men were moronic.  No I hadn't read any of these books before I bought the set, I did so merely on the reviews I read.  I will say that I didn't fall completely asleep during Middlemarch.  So here's my suggestion.  If you are a huge George Eliot fan and have read the books you will probably love this set and I hope you do. Otherwise I wouldn't suggest this outdated, bad acting box of snoresville!  Mine is going to charity!",1299110400,2,766,4.263888888888889

We anticipate that the rest will be equally as good.  These are classics and very well done.

The one DVD that we have watched so far was ""Silas Marner.""",1294099200,,434,4.443037974683544

2719573,4,B000M2E32C,"George Eliot is one of my favorite authors of English literature, and my favorite of her novels is Middlemarch. This collection contains five BBC adaptations of her works, i.e. Middlemarch, Daniel Deronda, Silas Marner, Adam Bede, and The Mill on the Floss. I shall review them based on my perceptions of which were the best adaptations of the works:

Middlemarch (1994)
This 1994 BBC adaptation of Middlemarch is well-cast. Douglas Hodge plays Lydgate, a doctor who arrives in the provincial town of Middlemarch intent on setting up a new hospital. Juliet Aubrey portrays Dorothea, a strong-willed and independent minded woman who is determined to improve lives. When these two young people collide, their lives change in a manner that they had never envisioned. This adaptation, thanks to an excellent script by Andrew Davies (who also penned the script for the glorious 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) and the great cast, bring the life of a town on the brink of the Industrial Revolution to vivid life. There's also strong performances by Rufus Sewell, Patrick Malahide, etc. `Middlemarch' never plods but engages the viewer's interest with its sense of realism and romance. As a fan of the novel, I was greatly pleased by this adaptation.

Daniel Deronda (2002)
This BBC adaptation is based on George Eliot's novel of the same name . The main character Daniel Deronda[Hugh Dancy], is a young man of unknown parentage who is the adopted son of a wealthy man, Sir Hugo, and has all the trappings of wealth, yet yearns for a 'real' purpose and searches for his identity. When the story begins, we are shown a scene where a beautiful woman [Romola Garai] is gambling at the roulette table and when Daniel [Hugh Dancy] stares at her, her winning streak comes to an abrupt end. She is intrigued by him, yet refuses to be introduced to him.
We are then shown a flashback to months earlier when the beauty, a Ms Gwendolyn is shown to be the toast of society, and is desired by the men of her society, both young and old, rich and not so rich. Gwendolyn typifies the spoilt young rich woman who tells her mother 'I hate everyone!' and posseses a fiery temperament. She attracts the particular attentions of Mr Grandcourt [Hugh Bonneville] who hides a malevolent and cruel streak beneath his sophisticated and attentive exterior. When she finds out a scandalous truth about him, Gwen flees to Europe before news that her family fortunes have been lost brings her back into Grandcourt's circle again.
Daniel's story is also no less compelling - he goes boating one day and saves a young woman who has attempted suicide. The young lady turns out to be a gifted singer and Jewess, Mirah Lapidoth [Jodhi May] who is in despair for her attempts to find her long lost mother and brother have been in vain. Daniel sends her to a friend's home to be nursed and taken care of, and pays all her expenses whilst trying to help her find her family. In the process, he inadvertently comes into contact with people whom he feels a strange affinity for and this leads him to uncover the truth of his own origins.
The action in this drama is non-stop - but I am not referring to the swashbuckling sort of action, rather the intensity of emotions and unfolding of the story of the two main characters - Daniel and Gwendolyn. Their stories though different, are also parallel for fate brings them together again. What happens to these two characters forms the backbone of the story and makes for compelling viewing. Hugh Dancy and Romola Garai do an excellent job as the leads, and the other characters are also equally credible in their roles. Hugh Bonneville makes an appropriately revolting villain, and Jodhi May plays the role of the impoverished yet gifted singer ably. The sets and score are simply beautiful as are the scenes of the English countryside and also other exotic locations.

The Mill on the Floss (1978)
This eight-part BBC adaptation of George Eliot's novel is one of the most faithful adaptations (I also liked the 1997 abbreviated version starring Emily Watson as Maggie Tulliver). This is at heart a story about tangled relationships and the fragility and fickleness of the human heart. Set in Lincolnshire in the 19th century, it explores the relationship between the Tulliver siblings, Maggie (Pippa Guard) and Tom (Christopher Blake), and of how their lives get tangled with that of their neighbor's Phillip Wakem (Anton Lesser). The hunchbacked Wakem's intellectuality attracts Maggie's interest, though Wakem is the one who becomes besotted. The fact that both patriarchs are bitter enemies and Tom disapproves, makes things worse. Personally, I found this story to be one of the most complex of Eliot's works, and really quite tragic. The production qualities are rather low-budget but this is quite a faithful adaptation.

Silas Marner (1985) & Adam Bede (1992)
I confess that the last two adaptations, i.e. Silas Marner (1985) and Adam Bede (1991) are not my favorites, and that has more to do with the fact that I've never been enamored of the novels themselves. Sir Ben Kingsley does acquit himself well though in the title role of Silas Marner, who despite having led a reclusive life for many years, changes dramatically when he decides to raise a motherless infant girl whom he names Eppie. Kingsley's performance is both touching and heartbreaking.
As for Adam Bede, the main shortcoming of this adaptation is the fact that it is too short, not to mention dull, and could have done with better casting. Iain Glen plays Adam Bede, a brash and arrogant young man and the role of Hetty the attractive farmgirl is played by Patsy Kensit (a poor casting choice). The role of Dinah is well-portrayed by Susannah Harker, and watching these characters collide makes for an interesting viewing experience though I did feel this was a weak adaptation of the novel.

Final verdict - this set is worth getting for fans of BBC period dramas, and those who love George Eliot's works.",1265673600,41,6031,4.868549172346641
2719574,1,B000M2E32C,"this is by far the worst of the worst series I have purchased. Some of the movies are HORRIBLE, namely Adam Beade. The rest seem to be written about men who are really weak and guided by their own weaknesses. How and why would each story play out like such. I thought Daniel Deronda would be better but he too is a fool! I don't recommend any of these movies unless you like sitting and being utterly disappointed by the actors, stories and worst the outcome/ending of each one of these hideous stories. Absolutely the worst of the worst ever made.",1261267200,3,548,4.435643564356436
2719575,5,B000M2E32C,"These are all accurate dramatizations of these excellent George Eliot novels. Were these theater films rather than TV series, they would deserve Oscars in many categories. Though nothing could fully convey the novels themselves, these film series should encourage many to read the originals--as intended. Highly recommended.",1257984000,7,324,5.914893617021277
2719576,4,B000M2E32C,"I have only been through the two movies, Silas Marner and Adam Bede, two of her books I have read.  Both acted very well, however Silas Marner followed the story better.  Of course Adam Bede is a longer book and requires considerably more editing.  I'm very satisfied however.  Hopefully our healthcare won't become comparable to the British TV production values.",1247184000,,363,5.0

I am a Masterpiece Theater fan, and love classic literature that has been adapted to the screen. I especially enjoy those done by Andrew Davies. If you like the PBS Masterpiece Theater series, you'll love these! My only negative comment on the collection was that I just couldn't bring myself to watch the ""Mill on the Floss""...it just didn't seem like it belonged in the set, and  was poorly done. But that is no reason not to watch the others in this wonderful set.",1241827200,4,627,4.598214285714286

""Mill on the Floss"" is a weak link, but understandably so, a very hard adaptation to make; I live in hope that Andrew Davies will get himself back together and do a good one.  The rest are absolutely sublime.  If you have the means, I highly reccomend picking one up (or five).",1239667200,4,382,4.205479452054795

These are great stories, and these films by the BBC follow the novels closely - I am surprised at how the film makers managed to get all the essentials of some very complicated plots into the films. Eliot's novels are filled with lots of authorial comment, some of which is hilarious, that cannot be translated onto the screen. But these films are terrific.",1516838400,,481,4.540229885057471
