958539,1,6305045976,"Those who would normally expect the quantum leap in magic the big screen  makes possible will be very disappointed.  After putting out  $$ apiece for  me and the kids, we walked out of the theater after only one hour and ten  minutes feeling ripped off.  Of course, you'd think that buying the video  is something else altogether:  but, alas, with this movie you don't even  get what you pay for at the reduced cost-experience of video purchasing.  Very few new songs.  A pitifully linear story line goes nowhere and is so  empty-ended that it make this an INSTANTLY forgettable story for even the  youngest of children.  True, it's harmless, but it's nothing else, either.  As an adult who sees the value of Barney (simplistic morality and civility  lessons for children), the full-length possibilities could have explored  the origin of Barney, perhaps even a new family member. or perhaps really  get into a deeper concept for children.  But we see nothing new here.  In  fact, we see no concepts here.  There is no advantage taken in character  interest--even Baby Bopp is a marginal appearance with the ol' Blankie  schtick.
  It's as if the day before production began the director  lost the script, the author was out of town, and the studio had to produce  something from scratch in one day.
  Kids should see Barney for free  on PBS is my recommendation.  Don't buy this video for them.  Don't reward  a studio or children's product that got by on the bare minimum!  Instead of  rewarding children for their interest in this character, they are taken  advantage of by a company that just wanted a few more millions.  A real  shame.  Now you know.

958716,5,6305045976,"This movie came out at the very height of Barney's popularity, and it didn't disappoint (at least in my household). The plot is cute and whimsical, fascinating to little kids and suffciently bizarre to hold adults' interest, too. The actors are winning, especially Diana Rice in the role of Abby. After an interval of several years without viewing it, my 11-year-old son, in a fit of nostalgia, requested that we watch the movie again; the scene when Barney first appears made him laugh as hard as I've ever seen him laugh in his entire life. If you're a hater, there's likely nothing here that will change your mind--but if, like us, you have a soft spot in your heart for the franchise, this weird, playful movie may tickle your fancy as it does ours.",1436227200,4,753,4.626865671641791

959057,1,6305045976,"I am a former Barney person and I still own some old tapes of ""Barney & Friends"" and I HATE this movie, because there's no ""adventure"" in this, except for Barney and three kids chasing an egg that has something ""magical"" inside. The film has almost no conflict and nothing really happens in the plot, the story is HORRENDOUS, horrible songs (especially the ""I Love You"" song) and I find Barney extremely irritatingly cheerful and smarmy and the cameos by BJ and Baby Bop looking for her blankie. I especially hate his laugh. Ugh! Please, don't show this to your kids. Here are some things that shouldn't have been mentioned or shown in this film: Cody says that rock singers who spit fire and professional wrestling are more cool to him than Barney's games of pretend, Abby and Marcella taunt Cody, we see (and hear) Barney talk to the audience, which is really dull, we see a wine bottle, and worst of all, the ""magical"" creature is a koala bear. Koala bears don't show dreams, they're just wild animals. And I also think that the title is self-praising, because of his ""great"" adventure. I didn't find ""Barney's Great Adventure"" great, I thought that it was one of the worst films I've ever watched. However, I enjoyed it when I was little, but those days are gone and they will never come again. I could've given this a zero if there were a zero movie rating on here. Anyway, that's how I feel about ""Barney's ""Great"" Adventure."" Stick to better things like ""Thomas & Friends"", ""Blue's Clues"", ""Sesame Street"", or some other kid's show that you enjoy more than this waste of time, life, and money. But, if you enjoy the film or think it's okay or so-so, that's fine and I respect your opinion or opinions. I won't change my opinion though. I'll always dislike this ""well made"" film.",1371254400,4,1785,4.598746081504702

I popped in the tape just to see the previews and maybe the movie, but I soon grew bored and turned off the tape after approximately 2 minutes into the flick and didn't bother to watch the rest. So, I decided to read the plot to this lame movie on Wikipedia and after reading reviews from critics, I was just glad that I didn't watch Barney's Great Adventure in its entirety.

However it turned out the opposite with many surprises like flying wood log, hatching egg, and favorite characters...  WOW!  My 2-yr old daughter is totally caught into the story and not caring anything happening around her every single time she's watching it.  It's like a magnet to her.  I'm really happy that I bought this DVD, a great investment.  This is one of the best DVD to my daughter among the collection of around 10 Barney DVD collection.  Hope this helps your decisions.

My 2 year old absolutely loves this, so I've seen it repeatedly and don't suffer. It is a cute story with a decent children's plotline and is visually appealing. The young actors are good and quite likeable. It's not as enjoyable as any of the recent Disney or Pixar productions (which have a lot of comic turns for adults as well), but for small children it has everything; a touch of magic, adventure, comedy, warmth, and lively musical numbers. Adults won't love it, but your little ones will! Another asset that's important to me is that there are no real scary moments. My 2 year old is not ready for scares, and that's why he doesn't watch *my* favorite kid's movies yet (toy story, monsters inc, etc.), and he won't be able to enjoy those for a couple of years at least.

959186,5,6305045976,"Barney the Dinosaur. I grew up watching this purple pal and lately as I grow much older than I was, I tend to get relatively disinterested in much of the other PBS broadcasting. But I picked up Barney's Great Adventure on DVD at the Wal-Mart I work in, and discovered that you can still be a big kid, and enjoy the movie with the littler ones you love.

The story follows three children. Abby and Marcella, two girls rich in imagination and dreams, who love Barney and play with the doll constantly, and Cody, a cynical young boy who is trying to be cool and doesnt automatically believe in Barney.

During a game of keep away started by Cody, Barney comes to large life thereby starting a chain of events that sends Cody reeling for the adventure he always dreamed of. Cody of course is stalwart in his disbelief of Barney, warning this may upset younger viewers because of the rude things said to Barney.

A night time conversation between Cody and Barney reveal Cody's need for adventure and the ""cool"" things. Trying to sway Cody to the perks of imagination, Barney encourages Cody to wish on a star. Well that star turns out to be a Dream Maker egg and it sends Barney and Friends on a wild egg hunt trying to find out what's inside it, as well as rescue it before too late.

With appearances by BJ and Baby Bop, the movie goes into more of it's more hilarious antics. Finally, when Twinken the Dream Maker hatches from his egg, Abby gets to see her dream more clearly, and Cody apologizes to Barney with an admission that the Purple Dinosaur is cool after all.

My opinion? Well, the movie is not entirely big budget, and nothing that could contend with Superman Returns or Ice Age 2, or Pixar's Cars. But kids of ALL ages, should appreciate the heart, and the intent of what the movie tries to say to us all. Will I ever continue to watch the show? Maybe, maybe not. But I will watch the movie over and over again.

And maybe, just maybe, through our own imaginations and determination, we all might make our own dreams come true. That message is what Barney and Friends put forth in the movie. Goes the same for kids and adults. I cant say for sure that every kid will like this movie. I did. And I recommend it for anybody who still believes that they can sing and dance and for one day if nothing else, hang with Barney. I think he's cool.

As an afterthought. Keep an eye out for performances by two of todays young actors. You might recognize Kyla Pratt from Dr. Dolittle and The Proud Family. And Trevor Morgan can be seen in the Spielberg dino movie(coming full circle are we?) Jurassic Park 3. George Hearn, of Annie fame, is the kids' grandpa.",1153094400,3,2659,4.414285714285715
959219,5,6305045976,"No, this movie is not interesting to adults, but my two year old granddaughter loves it.  It is the only full length movie that she will watch until the end.  Since she usually only watches TV right before bedtime, it takes her at least a week to watch the whole movie, but she will always insist on continuing to watch the movie right where she left off the night before. She responds to the movie with laughter and giving the actors advice on where to find the egg. The farm and the grandparents remind me of when I was little and spent my summers at my grandparents' farm in east Texas. Since my husband and I don't live on a farm, this is probably the closest that Annie will ever come to enjoying the summer farm experience.",1141948800,4,729,4.313868613138686

There is lot's of singing, dancing and make-believe in the film, all of which keep her clapping, dancing and laughing.  It actually entertains her for the entire 90 minutes!  I wish Barney had another movie so we wouldn't always have to see the same storyline, but luckily my daughter hasn't bored of it, yet.  Other children's movies seem to not hold her attention, probably because the storyline is for slightly older children (3+).  The singing and dancing in this movie are key!",1121644800,8,596,4.628571428571429
959223,5,6305045976,"We originally bought this movie when it was released for my older daughter. Now several years later, I bought it on DVD for my youngest. They both love it. My husband and I can both tolerate it too!!  My youngest daughter loves that she ""has"" to imagine along with Barney and the kids for things to work.  Great Pick 2 times!!",1114819200,,326,4.327868852459017
959224,3,6305045976,"I bought this DVD for my daughter because it was on sale at Wal-Mart and she's a big Barney fan.  Since this is a full length feature, I figured it would be a little bit different than the show.  Probably it would be 'smartened' up a bit for the reluctant adult audience...well, yes and no.

The plot is very simple and easy to follow for children.  Basically, these parents drop their kids off at their grandparents house in Maine.  The oldest, a cynical teenage boy, teases the two younger girls about their belief that Barney is real.  That is, until Barney comes to life!  Then, the kids discover a large colorful egg in their grandparents' barn.  Along with Barney, they take it to a neighbor who is a bird expert.  Soon after they determine the egg has a creature called a 'dreammaker' inside, they soon lose the egg.  Most of the movie centers around their pursuit of the egg and their various mishaps and adventures along the way.  I won't give away the ending, though most adults probably have a good idea about what it will entail.

Well, my daughter loves this movie.  This is one of the few live action movies that she will sit down and watch the whole way through.  Considering that she's hyper and the movie is about 90 minutes long, that's saying something.  She particularly enjoys the 'egg chase' section.

How do I like it?  Well, I can watch it at least.  And it does have a plot.  But honestly, I think the movie is just plain silly.  Their attempts to 'smarten' it up were intended for the older kids forced to endure this thing with their younger siblings.  The acting isn't very good.  Everyone sounds like they're reading off of cue cards.  I know this is hard to believe, but Barney does the best acting job of the bunch!  At least it sounds like he actually memorized his lines.  I was rolling my eyes at a lot of situations, which just seemed absolutely ridiculous to me.  Especially the guy who makes a milk shake and french fries while driving, then almost gets into an accident.  Go to McDonald's or Dairy Queen, you idiot!  Also, this movie has mediorce special effects, which seem to be worse than what they have on the show (which I didn't think was possible).  It looks like someone who just bought an Imac put them all in--it doesn't seem like a professional job at all.  If you're an adult and don't mind the show, you will probably be able to sit through this movie.  If not, I seriously doubt it.

About the supposed sex, drugs, swearing, etc.--This is the absolute truth, there is NONE.  There is some smart alecky remarks the kids say to each other, like ""Talk to the hand because the face isn't here"" but that's about it.  Also it is true that one of the kids steps in a cow patty, and unfortunately it's a close-up shot.  I was grossed out by it, but my daughter didn't care.  Other than that it's definitely a G rated movie.

Would I recommend it?  For kids, a definite yes.  For adults, no, even if you like Barney.  Unless you're planning to do an Mystery Science Theater-like viewing party for a bunch of your friends, I would definitely not suggest any adult buy it for themselves.",1114214400,5,3128,4.467256637168141
