6888183,4,B00QULFC1U,"Trust me, this event was pretty good, I'm just wanting to know why the hell it's getting released 2 months after it happened, and only a week before the Wrestlemania DVD itself, is released. Normally, aside from Wrestlemania, the events get released about a month after, if even that. So why is this so special?",1427155200,,311,4.672727272727273
6888184,3,B00QULFC1U,"Dolph Ziggler, Ryback, Seth Rollins vs. Seth Rollins, Big Show, Kane - The former ""Team Cena"" members took control early on working over all three men before The Authority was able to use their numbers game & taking advantage of a mistimed move to gain control isolating a member working over an injured part of the body including a submission hold from Big Show I never recall seeing from him before as both teams traded momentum with Dolph's team utilizing their individual strengths while The Authority did the same including dirty tactics where it came down to one team taking advantage of an opening in a solid match with the bigger story in the end not who won the match but who was left standing at the end.

Goldust vs. Stardust - The brothers were both attempting to play mind games with each other while evenly match & performing similar moves against each other as Goldust was able to take control staying one step ahead of staying a step ahead countering his offense while Stardust focused heavily on the midsection with moves like the body scissors & bear hug in a match that told a good story but never left first gear.

Tag Team Champions Usos vs. Tyson Kidd & Cesaro - It should be noted that the wives of the participants, Naomi & Natayala who wore one of the hottest outfits I've ever seen from her, were in their husband's corners as the Usos started out in control with their trademark offense of high flying & strikes before Kidd & Cesaro were able to single out one member & heavily work over a body part with various stretches & submissions as both teams went back & forth using double team maneuvers & sequences of hitting one big move after another in what was a short but physical match between both teams.

Right around here was the face to face meeting between Sting & Triple H were Triple H didn't show up as the COO in his suit but ""The Game"" in his street clothes ready for a fight leading to not only an eventual physical confrontation but the announcement later in the night that they would meet at WrestleMania.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Paige - Paige came out aggressive right from the start only for Nikki to eventually return it throwing her around on the outside as the divas went back & forth trading pin attempts with Paige throwing various kicks along with her PTO submission & Nikki delievering impactful moves such as the Alabama Slam & powerbomb as this came down to one girl just being able to catch the other & take advantage in a fast but competitive match.

Intercontinental Champion Bad News Barrett vs. Dean Ambrose - Ambrose came out right away with his fast paced brawling style causing Barrett to keep going to the outside only to finally get the momentum in his favor taking advntage of an opening using the ringside environment along with being able to stop Ambrose momentum dead on more than one occassion as they traded momentum with both men hitting on big moves both in & outside of the ring along with catching & countering each other in what was another match that was solid for what it was with the only negative being how the ending came off very bad.

United States Champion John Cena vs. Rusev - Cena take out hot delievering a knockdown blow in the opening seconds only for Rusev to deliver strong strikes to the midsection constantly stopping Cena's momentum dead in it's tracks by catching him & countering his offense but Cena was able to get some momentum catching Rusev in submission holds from the crossface to STF along with the Attitude Adjustment while Rusev did the same delievering impactful moves & catching Cena coming off the top rope along with capturing him in the Acolade.  This was the type of performance by Cena that was needed for Rusev as it's no secret how Cena is usually booked as ""superman"" against newer opponents (see Seth Rollins & Bray Wyatt this year outside of the recent Brock Lesnar series) always coming out on top regardless of the odds but that wasn't the case here as Rusev remained strong & dominate while setting open the doors for a rematch.

Roman Reigns vs. Daniel Bryan - The winner goes to face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania as both men were evenly matched early applying the same holds while countering & blocking the other's offense with Bryan relying on wrestling & Roman using his power as Reigns got more aggressive on the outside along with a clothesline that turned Bryan inside out & Bryan attempting to take away his size focusing on the legs eventually hitting him in his previously injured hernia area with Reigns showing the effects as they continued to trade momentum with each man catching the other in the middle of an offensive move only to deliever a hard shot of their own on more than one occassion including a sequence of non-stop counters & reversals with both men shocked that the other kicking out of finishing moves in what was a very competitive match for close around 20 minutes with J.B.L. stating it perfectly on commentary, ""Bryan is out-wrestling Reigns & Reigns is out-powering Bryan.""

The only thing of note from the pre-show was MizTV featuring Paul Heyman.  Normally the PPV between the Rumble & WrestleMania is pretty much a ""filler"" outside of one or two matches (usually the Chamber Matches) but this event not only did it's job in setting up rematches & storylines going into Mania but was a pretty solid & enjoyable PPV that was an overall step up from the Rumble.",1424995200,2,5433,4.632398753894081
6888185,3,B00QULFC1U,"The Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan & Ryback-Seth Rollins, Big Show & Kane-6 man tag team match was a slow paced match that would have been better if it was just Rollins vs. Ziggler in singles, but I get why they included the others. The Stardust-Goldust match was very below average to say the least. The Uso-Tyson Kidd & Cesaro-Tag Team title match was a pretty good tag match, but it also left me wanting more because I was hoping they could get 17-20 minutes and really have a classic tag match. The Nikki Bella-Paige-Divas title match was not great but pretty good. The Bad News Barrett-Dean Ambrose-IC title match was short with a bad DQ finish to boot. The Rusev-John Cena-US title match was a pretty power bout to say the least. The Roman Reigns-Daniel Bryan-#1 Contender Match was Terrific this side of any Wrestlemania main event. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1424736000,,866,4.5576923076923075

6888218,4,B00QULFC1U,"Well I thought this event was pretty good, not great but better than the Royal Rumble - even though the triple threat WWE title match at the Rumble was better than anything from this one!  Anyway - let's get to the matches:

1.  Six-man tag match: Ziggler/Rowan/Ryback vs. Rollins/Kane/Big Show:  Honestly I haven't cared much for 6-man tag matches since the Fabulous Freebird days!  But this one wasn't all that bad and quite entertaining at the end with the return of one of my favorites Randy Orton, he hit the ring whooping everybody which was great to see - reminded me of the old Mid-South days when Jim Duggan would jump in and clear the ring of Scandar Ackbar's cronies with his 2 X 4!!  HOOOOO-OOOOO!!!  LOL!  Big Show gets the knockout on Ziggler who looks like he's waiting for it with his head stuck out of the ring!!  Authority wins before Orton arrives!  Rating:  7/10

2.  Goldust vs. Stardust:  Is it me, or do the storywriters split up tag-teams way too often?  I think the Rhodes bros. should have stayed together - they were a great tag-team ... but I will say they had a pretty good singles match here!  Cody acts like he goes crazy with his Stardust persona and that he's abandoning his real identity - both Dustin and Dusty try to talk some sense into him, but he won't listen so this match had to come about!  Loved Dusty's segment back-stage telling Dustin not to hurt Cody... which he didn't, it was a clean match with a rollup win for Dustin!  Afterwards here comes Cody with an attack on Dustin in front of Dusty!  Pretty cool stuff!!  7/10

3.  Tag-team title match: Usos vs. Cesaro/Tyson Kidd:  What??  No Miz/Mizdow??  HALLELUJAH!!!!  This was the best tag match I've seen in a while!  Both teams looked great - loved the one-legged Cesaro swing on one of the Usos!  Some spots should have ended the match but the Uso would kick out, not looking very realistic (but I don't guess it's supposed to now and days)...  anyway - Kidd finally hits a snap-Perfect-plex for the win... Congrats to them!  8/10

4.  Sting/Triple H showdown segment:  This was just plain build-up with Triple H doing all the talking and running down WCW... he failed to mention that he got his start as a mid-carder in WCW before ending up in WWE.  Sting didn't say anything - just stared...  Triple H with a cheap shot and a mini beatdown before Sting grabs his bat and winds up hitting the Scorpion death-drop.  Pretty good segment but wish Sting would have talked!  LOL!  6/10

5.  Divas title match:  Nikki vs. Paige:  Well the Bellas are looking beautiful as always - always happy to see them no matter how their matches go!!  Love their cute little yellow outfits!!!  This match went okay but I missed Nikki's forearm smash which I love seeing!!  Paige has come into her own and has proven herself as a top contender!  If Nikki doesn't watch out she'll lose - but she didn't!!  Got the roll-up for the win!!  YIPPEE!!  Would have been 8/10 with Nikki's forearm smash - without it it gets a 7/10 from me!

6.  IC title match:  Barrett vs. Ambrose:  Eh- this was an okay match but didn't like the DQ ending!  Didn't Ambrose know if he didn't quit the stomping in the corner he'd be DQ'd??  The ref warned him plenty of times!  Some good spots in this one with Barrett hitting his Wasteland move, etc.,,,  6/10.

7.  U.S. title match:  Rusev vs. Cena:  Now this was the best match of the night!  Rusev getting the power moves on Cena and Cena hitting plenty of his Butch Reed flying shoulder blocks!  Loved the ending with Lana (who's looking lovely as always) distracting the ref and allowing Rusev to hit the low-blow - followed by the Accolade camel-clutch for the win!  9/10

8.  Bray Wyatt segment - another buildup spot where Wyatt sits up out of a coffin and makes a speech about the Undertaker...  kinda interesting I guess - at least Wyatt isn't afraid of the casket like most of Undertaker's opponents were back in the day...  5/10

9.  #1 Contender Match:  Reigns vs. Bryan:  Paul Heyman said in his pre-show interview that neither man could beat Lesnar - my sentiments exactly!!  This match started off slow with a cat/mouse game with Bryan getting a few kicks in - I didn't think Reigns looked all that great - maybe it was becaue he was getting over his hernia - but I thought he went slower than usual.  Anyway it picks up during the last 10 mins. with Reigns kicking out of Bryan's flying knee - Reigns hits his spear with Bryan covering his ribs with his left arm (smart move on his part) - Reigns is the winner and #1 contender!  If Reigns doesn't do any better than this he won't last 5 mins. with Lesnar!!  7/10

Overall this was an okay event but really only served as a buildup for WrestleMania!  Recommended for true WWE fans!",1432080000,,4754,4.48943661971831

6888220,5,B00QULFC1U,"Review for Rusev vs. Cena at WWE Fastlane 2015: This match showed both contestants giving it their all, Rusev to retain the US title and Cena trying to win it. The first chapter in the Cena/Rusev feud as the rivalry continues for the next three months- at wrestlemania, extreme rules, and the upcoming payback. Now for the technical issues. This match can only be viewed in HD on a computer or laptop. The kindle will always end at the 3 minute mark after the entrances. Amazon Digital worked on this issue but the match can not work on kindle. However, it is worth seeing the match and rather than paying ten dollars for the dvd because this was the match to see for Fastlane.",1431043200,2,677,4.467741935483871

FASTLANE 2015

1. KANE, BIG SHOW & SETH ROLLINS VS DOLPH ZIGGLER, RYBACK & ERICK ROWAN-really good opening match between these six men. This was a continued story in which The Authority members were still feuding with the guys who went against them in at the Survivor Series. Great back and forth action with all six of them getting moments to shine. This would come down to a big punch from Show leading to the win for his team. But after the match The Viper would return.

2. GOLDUST VS STARDUST-good match between the brothers and two of my favorite. They both work each other over pretty well here. The story here was that the little brother was feeling bitter after the team had fallen on hard times. Even their father [R.I.P. Dusty] got in on this before and after the match backstage. Big brother gets the win but looses backstage.

3.[TAG TITLE]TYSON KIDD & CESARO VS THE USOS-two great teams do battle here for the titles. The Usos defend against one of my favorite teams out there in Kid and Cesaro. Excellent action in this one with many near falls especially towards the end. Good team action here from both sides with the ladies on the outside, the wonderful Natalya and Naomi. Kidd and Cesaro take the titles in a great tag match.

It is after that match that we get the confrontation between Sting against Triple H. This was just about them getting to Wrestlemania with Triple H saying that he understands why Sting came back and he can help him with his legacy, HOF, DVDs, WWE Network and all of that. Of course Sting came to get down and the fight breaks out. Sting of course comes out on top.

4.[DIVAS TITLE]NIKKI BELLA VS PAIGE-we get the Divas title next and thankfully Paige is in it. This is a good back and forth match that would see Bella keeping the title. I love Paige so I was all about her winning here, of course I really want Natalya with the strap. Still good Divas match and much better than most give it credit for.

5.[I-C TITLE]BAD NEWS BARRETT VS DEAN AMBROSE-this was a real fun match with two more excellent guys. Barrett has always been a favorite of mine and Ambrose as well. This was a great brawl type match and hard hitting match. Another back and forth affair with each man taking it to the other. In the end Dean gets himself DQd but he takes the belt anyways.

After that match we get a GREAT segment with Bray Wyatt, possibly my favorite guy going today. He tricks the crowd into thinking the Undertaker is coming out only to pop out of the casket himself and cutting an EXCELLETN promo. This guy has got to be the best talker in the WWE today.

6.[US TITLE]RUSEV VS JOHN CENA-a much better match than I think people were expecting but I knew both guys could deliver. Rusev looked really good here dominating with his power but Cena always making those comebacks to get his fan hype. I liked how Cena seemed like he was going to get Rusev to tap only for Rusev to break it. In the end it would be Rusev who puts Cena to sleep retaining the title.

7. ROMAN REIGNS VS DANIEL BRYAN-this entire match happened because of the backlash of the Royal rumble. When Reigns was the last man standing in that match the fans flipped on him. so due to the backlash the WWE put this match together to give all of those fans hope that we would see Bryan in the main event of Wrestlemania again. This was a great match and probably the best of the night. We have two very different guys going at it here. Reigns uses his power to take it to Bryan and Daniel uses his superior technical skills to almost get the upset. Great false finishes and a great finis as well. I loved when Roman got that win as most of the crowd was crushed, I loved it.

As a bonus we get the Miz TV segment from the pre show with the genius Paul Heyman as well as a spot with the Bellas. This was a really good event with none of the matches being bad at all. In fact I liked all of them, not the best event but not the worst for sure. If you are fan pick it up.",1434758400,,3973,4.285333333333333
