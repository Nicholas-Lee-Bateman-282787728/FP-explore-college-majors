8584577,2,B00CPN932G,"I watched this movie due to random chance as I was looking through free Amazon Prime movies.  It had close to a 5 star rating, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  After watching the movie and reading the reviews on Amazon, I suspect many of these reviews are fake or written by people who are affiliated with the movie and have an inherent conflict of interest.

This is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.  The plot is nonsensical, and the directing is atrocious.  It tries way too hard to be deep and symbolic when it really could have done better by fully owning its ridiculousness as a fun, thoughtless action flick.  The multiple recurring scenes with the owl:  incredibly cheesy.  I didn't think much of the ending either.

One redeeming quality of the movie is the acting.  The actors they chose for this film were actually quite good.  It's too bad their efforts weren't spent on something a little more coherent and well thought out.",1468972800,,956,4.5321637426900585

8584582,5,B00CPN932G,"the story was well told...the actors help to draw you in. the cast was great. whitey was one of the best ""bad guys"" i have seen in a movie. he would show up at unexpected times....and you knew something bad was going to happen. i couldn't imagine this movie being made with anyone else cast as whitey. he really did a great job. i have watched the movie several times and picked up on small things i missed earlier. i would like to see more projects by this stellar team of alicia touche, mateo frazier and diego joaquin. they are great story tellers. this movie was very entertaining and showed an interesting part of the country that i think is beautiful.....northern new mexico. veronica diaz , melissa cordero,mark rios,elizabeth pena,raul trujillo, ryan begay, and the other cast members were teriffic.",1378857600,,807,4.771428571428571

8584585,5,B00CPN932G,"I was hesitant about this film initially, but was surprisingly amazed. The acting was superb and the music and cinematography made you feel as if you were in the film. This story provides a true glimpse into the Latino way of life. A must see!",1375488000,3,243,4.4222222222222225
8584586,5,B00CPN932G,This is a truly fantastic film. The acting is superb as well as the directing and production.  The story is so unique and unlike any film I have seen. It has depth and tells a story that is never told from the female as the protagonist. Do yourself a favor and watch it.  My only gripe is with the cover art! This is NOT some urban gangster film with gunplay and people dressed in flannels.  This film intertwines the Spanish culture with Native American mysticism and catholicism.  The sound track is banging!,1375142400,4,510,4.510869565217392
