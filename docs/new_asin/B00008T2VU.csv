1862299,1,B00008T2VU,"Horrible. Exactly who thinks they can improve on a Hitchcock film?
And this was Academy Award quality with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.
I've always thought that film was a little slow, but you can't deny Hitchcock is a master of film direction.
Andrew Grieve...not so much.
Leaden and charmless.",1459209600,,296,4.94

1862301,4,B00008T2VU,"As I remember it, I think that the Cary Grant version was more smooth than this one and easier to take but Anthony Andrews gave more tension to his part. Which was the better movie? It depends on what you are in the mood for at the time.",1455580800,,237,3.9583333333333335

1862309,5,B00008T2VU,"This is a review of the U.S. Release.......
Loved the movie! But if you plan on watching it more than once, DON'T BUT THIS EDITION!!! What everyone is saying IS true! The audio is out-of-sync with the video. So the dialogue is off enough to distract you from watching the film. Buy the UK Edition as this problem is not present in that release. You will need a Region-Free dvd player for the UK Edition but it's worth it.

Sidenote: I had e-mailed Kino Lorber about the problem and they never responded. So much for their ""quality"" releases.

The movie itself is wonderful! Jane Curtin takes on the dramatic role with only hints of her character on ""Kate & Allie"". It is quite an enjoyable movie! It lives up to the title. There isn't a lot of suspense, only a few moments. But the essence of the storyline is to be suspicious of one's spouse and what would you think? It plays out the story well til the end.",1453075200,,909,4.372781065088757
1862310,3,B00008T2VU,I watched this version and even though it is good it doesn't live up to the original with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. The older mysteries were better showed more suspense than the ones today.,1451865600,,193,4.542857142857143

1862313,5,B00008T2VU,Anthony Andrews did a fine job in this classic in spite of the fact that it must have been a difficult act to follow  - Cary Grant's performance was pretty good. And Jane Curtin's performance was a good one as well!  I really enjoyed the show!  The updating of the matrix was very well done - the details were respected and so the effect was as chilling as we hoped. Happy Halloween.,1446249600,,383,4.291666666666667

1862329,3,B00008T2VU,Not the thriller that made Hitchcock a household name but good.  Part of the problem is it's older technology.  Would be a great one to re-make sometime.,1441324800,,153,4.62962962962963
1862330,3,B00008T2VU,This picture is an average remake of Hitchcocks version with Cary Grant.  This always felt like a mismatch of Playboy and plain Jane.  They just didn't fit.  It is important to cast characters that actually complement each other.  You never got that feeling.,1440892800,,258,4.930232558139535

1862332,1,B00008T2VU,"I kept hoping this film would deviate from the Cary Grant film for the ending that Hitchcock wanted to make but wasn't permitted to do so because Grant was the beloved superstar of the era and it wasn't appropriate for him to portray a wife killer.  Unfortunately, the produces must have regurgitated the original script to save money and this wasn't worth the time I spent watching it.  My advice is to watch the original black and white version with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine--that is truly a wonderful film.",1438992000,,513,4.688888888888889
1862333,3,B00008T2VU,A bit outdated now but still interesting.  It was fun to see Jane Curtin playing this part rather than being comedic.,1436745600,,117,4.571428571428571
1862334,1,B00008T2VU,Shouldn't have wasted time on this. Watch Hitch original; this remake doesn't come close. And Curtin is SO miscast it's pitiful.,1436745600,,128,5.142857142857143

1862339,3,B00008T2VU,"It is just about impossible to follow Cary Grant ......Anthony Andrews is quite charming in the movie and I thought it fine. But, the chemistry between him and Jane Curtain was just not there for me. I would watch it once but it does not live up to the classic ""Suspicion"" IMHO.",1434412800,,278,4.365384615384615

1862341,2,B00008T2VU,"This is a poor remake of the original, stilted and forced acting make it hard to watch. But, then again, the original made by Alfred Hitchcock  was excellently done.",1433721600,,165,4.689655172413793
1862342,1,B00008T2VU,I couldn't watch this after a certain point even though I'm a big fan of Anthony Andrews.  I would watch the great Hitchcock version first.,1433721600,,139,4.56

1862347,3,B00008T2VU,"This story involves a leading character that is hard to like.  Right from the first 5 min of the movie, I thought this man was a jerk for borrowing money from a complete stranger.  Not a way to make a good first impression.  He was so egotistical and self centered---who could like such a fool, even if he had attractive physical features.  Its hard to believe that this was a Hitchcock creation.  Acted well but not very realistic story in my view.",1429574400,,449,4.426829268292683

1862349,4,B00008T2VU,"A Campy, fun remake of the old classic.  Anything Anthony Andrews and I'm in  :)  A  few other reviewers though Jane Curtin was miscast- but I thought She did well, and was well-suited for the role.",1429056000,,198,4.416666666666667
1862350,2,B00008T2VU,"Love at first sight - married quickly - then the troubles begin.  This is not a bad movie, but slowly adds suspicion then the end ... well, watch it with some popcorn and a cold drink ... fortunately, it is not too long.",1429056000,,220,4.116279069767442
1862351,2,B00008T2VU,Not too bad. A different kind of role for Jane Curtin after seeing her on SNL in the early days.,1428019200,,96,3.85

1862357,2,B00008T2VU,"Weak remake of a Hitchcock classic. I'm not sure what the point was. The script was almost verbatim to the original, but Jane Curtin and Anthony Andrews had none of the chemistry of Joan Fontaine and Cary Grant. Perhaps I'm too used to seeing her on SNL's Weekend Update that I just didn't buy her as the introverted and frightened Lina McLaidlaw. And he had none of Cary Grant's charm. Do yourself a favor and watch the original.",1426723200,,430,4.5256410256410255

1862361,3,B00008T2VU,Interesting remake but NOT nearly as good as the original.  Main characters lack believability.  Didn't like the Protagonist from the beginning.  Ok on a rainy day if you have nothing else to watch.,1425945600,,198,4.9393939393939394

1862364,2,B00008T2VU,"I own  the  original  1941 DVD , and I know it by heart having watched it more than 20 times. Jane does an ok job,  I believe she tried to underplay this role and she almost pulled it off. As for Andrews, whom I usually enjoy for his originality, copied Cary Grant's performance down to the letter, complete with mannerisms, tone of voice, facial expressions!.....He was a disappointment. I am giving it 2 stars only because It gave me a chance to see Betsy Blair. She played the girlfriend in the very excellent movie  from 1955 "" Marty"".",1422748800,,539,4.459183673469388
1862365,2,B00008T2VU,"AnthonyAndrews did well and was very believable as John Asgarth.  Which is saying a HUGE amount when considering he was acting against Jane Curtin.  I felt that he had to drag her through every single scene.  He would have done as well against an inflatable doll.  I was shocked that the clothes were done by Ralph Lauren.  In the original, once Monkeyface found her love, she began to glisten and become so pretty.  Jane looked as frumpy in the last scene as she did in the first scene.  Go watch Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.  This movie is a waste of your valuable time.",1422748800,,573,4.4423076923076925

1862369,2,B00008T2VU,"I normally like Jane Curtin, but she is too bright and witty to be believed as the milquetoast Lina.

1862370,5,B00008T2VU,"I saw it when it first aired on television many years ago. I enjoyed it then and was quick to purchase it when it came out on DVD.

It is really a good movie. I hope you will enjoy it too.",1417046400,,188,3.5853658536585367

1862378,1,B00008T2VU,"I wish there was a ""no"" star rating.  It is completely out of sync.  The lips move well before the words show up!  And, Jane Curtain is an absolutely cardboard actor who is portrayed in this story line as a completely brain dead woman.  You can almost see that Anthony Andrews (a wonderful actor) is cringing through his role in this sappy ridiculous movie.  Sorry I purchased it.",1386460800,,380,4.529411764705882
1862379,4,B00008T2VU,"This film was shown on PBS in 1988 and much heralded, describing the production values as being first rate, many of the clothes as being done by Ralph Lauren, their car as the iconic and classic Mercedes 450 SL/380 SL/560 SL convertible that was driven by characters in all the prime-time soap operas of the era, etc.

While Jane Curtin's character can be a little too subdued to identify with, and Anthony Andrews seems a bit smug and disengaged, the real star here is the score by composer Larry Grossman, especially the opening and ending credits.

Well worth the money, especially after such a long, long wait and settling for VHS copies and VHS-to-DVD copies.",1374537600,,664,4.765217391304348

I actually liked the remake better than the original.  I admit that I thought Joan Fontaine was perfect for the part in the original, but I liked Anthony Andrews better than Cary Grant.  I guess it's a matter of personal taste.  Cary Grant is wonderful actor, but I think Anthony Andrews was even better in this one instance.  His performance was totally convincing and kept me guessing as to how the movie would end right up to the last moment.",1344816000,,573,4.795918367346939

7986965,2,B00008T2VU,"Why remake a movie when the only differences from the Hitchcock original are the actors and the set? I don't think Anthony Andrews did a better job of portraying a lovable ne'er-do-well than Cary Grant, and although he's very handsome, not as handsome as Cary. Jane Curtin was a weird choice to play the role that Joan Fontaine played in the original movie. Jane did an OK job but I kept having flashbacks of her many hilarious characterizations on Saturday Night Live.

There has been LOTS of successful remakes, even by Hitchcock of his own movies. For example, ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much/dp/B000ICXQVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>&nbsp;with Doris Day and James Steward. There, the character of the woman was quite different, as was part of the story.

""A Perfect Murder""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Perfect-Murder/dp/B002AT8KAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Perfect Murder</a>&nbsp;is a MUCH IMPROVED version of ""Dial M for Murder"" http://www.amazon.com/Alfred-Hitchcock-Collection-Northwest-Strangers/dp/B00CK1S4GE/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1461107935&sr=8-4&keywords=dial+m+for+murder. David Suchet's small role triggered an interesting dimension of Gwenyth Paltrow's character. Enhancements over the Hitchcock original included the complexity of the characters, the production values, and most of all, extended the plot. I am told that 2 different endings were filmed. Maybe you can find and view the alternative ending.",1461024000,,1601,6.960199004975125
7986966,4,B00008T2VU,"It's a fun movie with the beautiful Jane Curtin. She plays a somber, introspective and fiercely loyal person. The movie has interesting characters, is funny at times, and really makes you think.",1461024000,,194,5.09375
