5904215,2,B00EDAGZY8,"The film opens in California 1866 as a young Lesley Parker toting an anachronistic Teddy Bear, sees her parents die. Then we jump to Paris 1885 where she (Erica Leerhsen) is a student of Dr. Charcot (Michael Crabtree) along with a guy named Freud (Matt Moore). Together they treat a patient Val Drakul (Chase Ryan Jeffery) who thinks he has the family curse and is a vampire. Lesley becomes attached to Val and they go off to California where she treats patients in group sessions with phobias. One such patient is Annabel Lee (Carolyn Wickwire) who sleeps in a glass lid coffin. Val suffers from black outs, during which time someone gets their throat ripped out, but it is not that simple Scooby-Doo.

The costumes were decent. The plot, as you can tell, left something to be desired. The acting was no where as the dialog was flat. The action and twists are loaded heavy at the end while the rest of film is a yawner.

5904217,2,B00EDAGZY8,"*NO SPOILERS* First, this film is much more an attempt at a psychological thriller than horror - despite the DVD cover art. I also did not find this one interesting at all. It seemed to want to find a footing in the descent of a homebound agoraphobic (a storyline we've all come across more than once), yet, this failed to engage me at any level. The acting was average, on the whole (a check of the actors' previous roles showed most had a decent amount of experience); however, even their performances could not bring me to care about any of them, including the lead. The production values were slightly above average for a microbudget indie film, and it was well edited. However, those qualities aside, and while I did sit through the entire film in order to ensure I'd critiqued it on its full content, this was just, well... boring. No real thrills, or scares, or interesting twists.",1418515200,,888,4.6265822784810124

5904219,2,B00EDAGZY8,"Like far too many horror films these days  the intriguing cover art of Rory Douglas Abel's debut feature, ""Phobia"", promises  an inventive horror film that does not exist anywhere in the actual feature's 84 minutes. The story desperately wants to be a real mind-bender, and it occasionally works to a degree, but when all is said and done it really doesn't offer anything we haven't seen in many variations before.

  Michael Jefferson, as the agoraphobic main character who begins seeing the bodies of those he loves and gradually cannot decipher what is real and what is inauthentic, gives a competent performance but, honestly, he is the only worthwhile and capable actor to be seen here. The rest of cast is admirably amateurish,which is to say they're acting abilities are not wholly bad but they leave much to be desired, and with some future roles may be able to mold them selves into fine performers.

  There are a few imaginative moments throughout (a woman sprouting spider legs out of her back is especially intriguing) but it is severely limited by its shoestring budget. As is a case for filmmakers to be creative with what little money they have to spend on the project, and that surely the case here, but because of this there is too much filler dialogue, crawling around dark spaces to pad the running time and because of this the pace often lags. Perhaps it is meant to better place us into the antagonist's mind but the single home setting of the movie becomes quickly dull and one but cannot help but think this is strictly because of the budget limitations.

  What is also sad to see is that there is no genuine surprises. As is often said with these type of genre entries it's fairly interesting the way it plays with the man's fears and the way he questions reality yet, the movie is never truly captivating or original.

  The direction also suffers from one a lot of low budget horror films do and that's a point and shoot sense of style behind the camera. All the attempts at terror because of this come off as cheap efforts to frighten us (there's a strange charm to the few gore effects) and therefore does not work.

  Sadly, this movie is a disappointment because it plays it too safe and because of the tired scares and the far from new way it was shot and acted and the way the story unfolds the movie fails to work or be satisfactory on it nearly every level. I will give it extra credit her breaking out of the stronghold of found footage paranormal and zombie films that have overtaken the genre these days. It's refreshing to see something outside of these types of films but that the proceedings are still painfully familiar.",1417737600,,2663,4.619957537154989
5904220,4,B00EDAGZY8,"A strong first feature that really puts its characters through the ringer during it's 84 minutes with some pretty memorable turns, most notably from Jefferson as the agoraphobic shut-in MacKinlay, whom the story centers around, and Schoofs who plays his wife in some particularly unsettling moments in the film.

5904223,1,B00EDAGZY8,"Let me sadly admit that I did purchase this and the next day it went straight to Prime.  The 15 bucks or so had to be at least half of the cost for its total operating budget.  This had to be, without any undue invective on my part, the most silly, uninspired and boring piece of drivel that could be churned out.  The acting was straight from a middle school production, albeit with less passion. There was no storyline and the most 'exciting' thing about this 'film' was the cover art.  Please, even thought it is free to Prime members, do not take precious time from your day to watch this; I implore you.",1417219200,9,608,4.307017543859649

8604155,5,B00EDAGZY8,"This movie is seriously creepy.  It's tense and disturbing and psychologically chilling.  The director, Rory Abel, skillfully captures the protagonist's fears and confusion, and the blurred lines between madness and reality.  I especially like the tone - it gets away from the derivative torture porn, zombie, and vampire directions that most indie horror movies have been living in for the past few years - it digs deep, really working its claustrophobic and taut atmosphere to put the viewer inside the main character's twisted, degenerating mind.  It stays with you, and it keeps you thinking, and it's smart and thoughtful enough to work for both horror and psychologic thriller fans.  I highly recommend!",1419292800,2,709,5.294642857142857
8604156,5,B00EDAGZY8,"It's the kind of thriller where you never quite know what's real. It keeps its audience off balance and every time you feel like you can predict what's next, something altogether different than your expectations happens.

I particularly loved the scenes with the therapist and the ending. If you're open to a different kind of horror film, I would highly recommend you give Phobia a chance.",1419120000,2,390,4.909090909090909
8604157,4,B00EDAGZY8,"I reviewed this title because I was sent a free viewing.  Despite that kindness I give my candid thoughts below.

The story is a complex psychological tale of an agoraphobic trapped in his home after a personal tragedy.  He is haunted by ghosts of his past life in this gripping thriller.

On the positive side, the producers do a good job of showing the life of a person with schizophrenic delusions.  The portrayal is dark and gripping and grips your attention tightly and consistently throughout the film.  Anyone wondering what it's like to live inside the head of a person with agoraphobia is well advised to watch this film.

To the negative, there are a few production foibles.  The audio is at times muddy and dialog is imperfect but on the whole the film does very well for itself given that it's an independent film.  A solid choice for nights when you want a psychological thriller without a ton of gore.",1419033600,4,915,4.633540372670807
8604158,5,B00EDAGZY8,"Earlier today I read What Culture's list of the top 10 horror movies of the year. I love critic S Mathers' writing, but find she gets far too hung up one whether movies are ""relatable"" or not. It's all a matter of the viewer's imagination. If one is open minded, as I fancy myself to be, then it's possible to relate to any situation, however farfetched. If one is extremely closed minded, the only thing relatable will be one's own home videos.
I think a far better litmus test for horror movies is, ""Would I enjoy this even if nothing scary happened."" Well, where this low-budget, high-production-value indie film is concerned, I fell in love with lead actor Michael Jefferson right away, and the (purely platonic) infatuation only grew deeper as the movie progressed. I would have been happy to watch a movie about Mr Jefferson assembling his paper clip collection, so capable is he of carrying a film, even one like this where he has to go through some very intense and tricky acting situations as the only actor on screen. It didn't hurt that he was backed up with a strong plot and a very good script.
About fifteen minutes in, when Jefferson's agoraphobic Jonathan ""Mac"" MacKinlay (does anybody spell it that way?) has a confrontation with a figure known only as the Home Invader (Jason Grimste) the word ""Hitchcock"" fell into my mind. This is not a name I drop lightly, but practically every frame of the film from then on bore out the connection. The artful way that terror can be drawn out of the smallest details, such as the sound of celery being chopped, suggests that the director and cinematographer have taken a lot of time studying this particular grandmaster of fear.
Also notable are the wonderful Sarah Scoofs, who does an excellent job of oscillating between sweet and scary, and the accomplished Emma Dubery, who did this lecherous viewer the favor of showing off her gorgeous thighs in most of her scenes, and who also really endears herself as a true light of hope for a man in a hopeless situation. Andrew Ruth acquits himself quite well as Mac's best and only friend, and Peter Gregus shows good range as psychiatrist Dr Edmondson. The extremely charismatic Debbie Rochon is really the only big flaw in this movie. Adorable as she is, she comes off totally false as the door-to-door Bible Basher.
There's nothing original about the score, but it is subtle and quite effectively manipulative.",1418515200,6,2417,4.7434679334916865
