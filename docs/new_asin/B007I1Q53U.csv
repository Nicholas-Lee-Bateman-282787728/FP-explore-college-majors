5087421,5,B007I1Q53U,this is an exalent show you never no what they are going to find its a must see for any yard sale person i would tell people to watch this show,1355616000,,143,3.6451612903225805
5087422,5,B007I1Q53U,I love this show.  I was never able to see all of the episodes from this season until I bought the dvd.,1355356800,,103,3.6818181818181817
5087423,5,B007I1Q53U,"From seeing the show on TV, I knew I would love the DVD. I love the interaction of all the characters, they each have their own quirk that makes them who they are. The premise is simple, a bunch of characters that go to auctions of storage lockers in California and bid against each other. The way they act toward each other and scheming they try to do to get what they want and also the thrill of seeing what they end up with in their locker. Is it a fortune or a failure? I would recommend this to everyone, no matter who you are you will like this unless you don't watch TV and have been locked in a cage their whole life, which I don't think that happens, does it ?",1354233600,,669,4.037593984962406
5087424,5,B007I1Q53U,"great show.  It has very likeable characters and they are just average people.  It has a bidding part and then an appraisal part.  A reality show for people who don't like reality shows.

Sort of like treasure hunting for people that own their own small business or just know a lot of different people they can unload speciality items too.  And also know a lot of people to get specialty items appraised

It has the last 16 episodes of season 2.

5087425,5,B007I1Q53U,In your review I still didn't know what was in this DVD--Is it all the RERUNS we are seeing now EVERY SINGLE NITE?,1341446400,,114,4.0
5087426,5,B007I1Q53U,"Don't expect much and you will find this to be a fun show to watch.  Do I believe some of the treasures are actually left behind in abandoned storage lockers?  No.  Do I lend any credence to the supposed values of the found treasures?  No.  Nonetheless, it's fun to see some of the stuff the actors pull out.",1383177600,,308,4.241379310344827
5087427,5,B007I1Q53U,Love this show. Much better on dvd then television. No commercials. Can't wait for more volumes to come out. Great price.,1379030400,,121,4.809523809523809
5087428,1,B007I1Q53U,"I love the show Storage Wars, but was surprised when I bought ""volume 3"" only to find that it is really the second half of Season 2!  I made the incorrect assumption that Season and Volume would mean the same thing.  This review is a warning for others before purchasing.",1374451200,3,271,4.4
5087429,5,B007I1Q53U,"Fun show, cheaper to get the DVD than buy through iTunes. Although I wished I had them digital, so I burned the DVDs and now my HD is filling up, so iCloud may be worth the money if your are digital.",1372550400,,199,3.8780487804878048
5087430,5,B007I1Q53U,A very good bunch of movies about Storage Wars. Berry is just so funny and unusual that he is fun just to watch.,1370390400,,112,3.9130434782608696
5087431,5,B007I1Q53U,very entertaining and i have a really good time watching the war as it happens. nobody beats Barry in all front - event hough he always loses!!,1363219200,,143,4.333333333333333
5087432,5,B007I1Q53U,"I really enjoy these shows, I could watch them over and over!
Dave Hester is my favorite!
I used to do this for fun, I would like to start doing it again!",1360281600,,154,3.84375
5087433,5,B007I1Q53U,"Another series I got addicted to on Netflix that is no longer available for instant streaming.  Thankfully, this collection offers a good representative sample of episodes and portrays the characters involved that make the series great....if you like the show, get it :)",1356739200,,270,5.27906976744186
5087434,5,B007I1Q53U,This DVD is the third of three volumes. It presents in it's entirety the very best moments of the third season.,1356652800,,111,4.333333333333333
5087435,5,B007I1Q53U,I love watching people find great stuff and get good deals on common items. I especially like how they show the value of each item and how they show how much each person will make when they sell the items at current market prices. I also like when they find those rare items worth a lot of money in the bins. Very interesting and unique show that will keep you guessing all the way to the end.,1356652800,,393,4.116883116883117

8516965,4,B007I1Q53U,"This is actually Season 2 episodes.  Amazon is misleading on these sets.  Although Amazon advertises as if it is Season 3 and one assumes it is all of Season 3, there are only a handful of episodes on this two disc set and they are from Season 2.  Amazon states Season 3 but if you look at the disc set itself, it states VOLUME 3, not Season 3.  The same goes for Volume 2 and and volume 4.  Each set is two discs and they basically continue the episodes in order starting with Season 2.  Season 1 may be complete, but unsure as I do not have that set yet.

I still gave it 4 stars as I do like the shows and glad they are on disc but it would be nice to get complete seasons in each set.  The quality is very good though the areas where commercials would be inserted are a bit rough, as if they were recorded off the air (quality of shows themselves assures me they were not recorded in that manner).",1463356800,,901,4.022471910112359
