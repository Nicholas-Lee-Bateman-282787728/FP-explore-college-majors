4460298,4,B004RBC5I8,"WWE Over The Limit 2011

This was a decent ppv, nothing amazing but worth a few views.

We start out with
Rey Mysterio VS. R-Truth
I like these two, while the match was nothing amazing it wasn't bad. They have good chemistry together and if WWE put effort into a storyline and worked harder on making matches between the two it would be a good rivalry. This match was decent not bad by any stretch but was solely to gain R-Truth heel heat for his upcoming rivalry and match with cena at capital punishment. Liked the bottle to the head of Mysterio at the end got Truth some decent heat. Decent opener 2.5/5
Winner=R-Truth

Intercontinental Championship
Wade Barret (C) VS. Ezekiel Jackson
It was your typical big man match a bunch of punches and kicks with ezekiel becoming a powerhouse at the end and dominating Barret before the Core got involved. This match could of been done on raw it was simply a time filler to put over the rivalry for another match. It was an ok if that match not horrible but not good at all. 1.5/5 and im being generous wwe could of make a much better match between the two, both of these big men are good athletes capable of much more.
Winner=Ezekiel Jackson via DQ hence Barret still IC champ

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Big Show and Kane (C) VS. CM Punk and Mason Ryan (New Nexus)
Decent tag team match could of been done on raw but fit on this card, Kane and Big show did their typical offense and defense, Mason ryan showed what a power house he was and CM Punk was the true skill in this match and made it a decent showing for the most part as he usually does. Decent contest CM Punk and Mason Ryan should of won the titles here idk why wwe didn't capitalize on them doing so. 3/5 stars
Winners=Big Show and Kane

WWE Divas Championship
Kelly Kelly VS. Brie Bella (C)
This is your typical diva match from raw, it was an ok showing nothing worth while and basically a time filler. Kelly Kelly and her offense was the saving grace in this match and made it bareable. ok match decent if that 1.5/5
Winner=Brie Bella

World Heavyweight Championship
Randy Orton (C) VS. Christian
This was god's gift to Over The Limit and I'm sure the fans were grateful for this beauty. So Christian and Orton have had a mutual respect since Orton Beat Christian on his first SD! show after being drafted, just 5 days after christian won the title in a ladder match at Extreme Rules. These two have always had good chemistry and I love when they lock up, Ive been waiting to see a rivalry between the two since their great 1-1 match against each other on Raw before WM21 in 2005. This Match was great back and forth offense and defense from the two. The ending offense and reversals were great and memorable, this is what a clean wrestling main event should be and it showed. This match would of stood out on any card. This match hit you hard and delivered while leaving you with the knowledge theyd probably lock up again down the road. Match of the night no questions asked. 5/5
Winner= Randy Orton

Kiss My Foot Match
Jerry The King Lawler VS. Michael Cole
This was a time filler, it was entertaining but was simply a comedy sketch/beatdown of michael cole with appearances by Jim Ross and Eve. A suprise end appearance by Bret Hart. 3/5
Winner= Jerry Lawler

WWE Championship I Quit Match
John Cena (C) VS. The Miz w. Alex Riley
This match I feel is underrated. The Miz like him or not is a great heel and while hes decent in ring most of the time, on some nights not even he excells as a mouthpeice. He did the typical thing and used Alex Riley to virtually beat down John Cena the whole match. It was an entertaining match and was a decent main event. In my opinion Orton VS. Christian should of ended the show but this was an OK main event. The Miz did a clever move not done yet in wwe history by having a recording of cena saying I quit on his cell phone and while cena's head was down holding the mic and cell to cena's mouth and trying to win the match that way, after declaring The Miz the winner the ref found the cell and the recording and restarted the match which enabled Cena to make The Miz say I quit in a rather fast manner. It was a good main event, good I quit match between the two i was expecting less to to tell you the truth. 4/5
Winner=John Cena

Overall I give this PPV 3.5/5, I rounded to 4 on here. I suggest renting it first and if you like it then buying it. I didn't see it until I bought the Blu Ray and while it wasn't close to amazing it was a decent watch and a ppv i don't mind owning thanks to the king/cole segment, The better then expected I Quit match between John Cena and The Miz and the Amazing match put on for the world title between Randy Orton and Christian, that match made the night for me and it's one I can and will watch over and over again. But again I suggest renting before buying to see if you want it in your collection. I buy almost every ppv so I expected to buy it anyway. hope this helped.",1308700800,2,4969,4.255296610169491
4460299,2,B004RBC5I8,"Over the Limit:

1. Rey Mysterio vs R-Truth: This was actually the 2nd best match of the night, not a bad match at all, but just didn't get enough time, the right man won and now hopefully WWE can really make R-truth look like a key superstar **3/4

2. Wade Barret(c) vs Eziekal Jackson I.C Title: This was horrible, a lot of kicks and punches and no wrestling at all, it dragged, it went on for 7 minutes, and even that was to long for this match, no much to say really, apart from the ending was horrible, and we are going to have to sit through another car-wreck between these two in the future *1/4

3. Sin Cara vs Chavo Guerrero: This was very dissapointing, it was Caras frist ppv match and it wasn't a classic, basically, chavo gets no offense in what so ever, the lighting for sin caras matches are awful, the ending was completley flat and botched, the only good thing about the match was sin cara flying all over the place **1/4

4. Big Show/Kane(c) vs CM Punk/Mason Ryan WWE Tag Team Titles: This was a typical RAW match, CM Punk should be fighting for the WWE Title but instead WWE are making him sit through a match with the worst tag team I have ever seen, Big show and Kane have chemistry with nobody and this wasn't different, this wasn't as bad as I thought it would of been, Punk saved this match for me, I DONT HAVE A CLUE WHY NEXUS DIDNT WIN THE TITLES, HOW STUPID IS WWE!!!!! **

I don't review divas matches

5. Randy Orton(c) vs Christian WH Title: So after all of the crap that weve had to sit through, here comes the WH title match, this was sent from the heavens above, this match was great, especially for a match with orton in, lots of nice moves, some aweome near falls and counters, and these got given a lot of time to work a great match, hopefully his isn't the last match we see between these two because they clearly both have great chemistry together ****1/4

6. Jerry Lawler vs Michael Cole Kiss My Foot Match: I was dreading this match, it was still horrible but it was the best match in their fued by a mile, it was kept really short which was great and the ending was fine, and it was great to see bret hart hit a sharpshooter on cole! *3/4

7. John Cena(c) vs Miz WWE Title I Quit Match: You ae either going to love this match or you are going to hate it, and i didn't like it at all, there are so many problems with this match, first the match goes on for 27 minutes almost double the amount of time orton and christian was given, secondly, cena gets dominated for 25 minutes, getting hit with every weapon in the book, then miz uses a recorder to make it look like cena said i quit which he never, the ref rings the bell and it is all over... but no, the ref restarts the match, and here comes SUPER CENA, he remarkably puts riley through a table and then hits miz with an STF and it is all over, this match frustarted me in so many ways, after going through 25 minutes of torture how can you make a guy that hasn't been hurt at all say i quit in 1 minute of the restart, this match just wasn't good, it makes cena look invinsible and now he is going to hold the title untill the match with the rock at wrestlemania 28 **1/4

Match of Night: Orton vs Christian
Worst Match of Night: Barret vs Jackson
Moment of Night: Bret returning!!!

Overall PPV: 5.5/10

This ppv wasn't good at all and is not worth your money, go and buy extreme rules 2011 instead because it is 50 times as better!!!",1307232000,,3430,4.181818181818182
4460300,3,B004RBC5I8,"Rey Mysterio vs. R-Truth - We got a different entrance than usual from R-Truth with no rapping, dancing, or music.  This started off with Rey doing the frakensteiner off the apron onto Truth on the floor early on with Truth later running Mysterio's head into the post on the apron that caused Mysterio to bounce off onto the floor.  Action continued in the ring with Rey delivering a bulldog to Truth off the second rope followed by a stiff kick to Truth's head with Truth later rebounded by pulling Rey off the apron with him crouching the ring banner followed by a clothesline & his forward swinging DDT for the win following by having his ""celebratory drink.""  This was all about getting Truth over as a heel which worked as the crowd definitely hated him more when he left than they did when he started.

Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. Ezekel Jackson - Jackson was kicked out of The Corre after having so many differences with the group setting up this match here with Jackson dominating early on with his power to the point where Wade had to fake an injury to get an advantage before working over Jackson using the ringpost before Jackson was able to recover & beat down Barrett by bodyslamming him non-stop, as the crowd kept getting louder for each one, working over his back & setting up for the Torture Rack before The Corre got involved.  This match was only about furthering the storyline between Jackson & his former group along with showcasing Jackson as a powerhouse as the crowd started getting more into him as the match went on.
As a side note, Michael Cole was more focused on plugging his upcoming match with Lawler & insulting the commentators than calling the match so I would put this on mute.

Sin Cara vs. Chavo Guerrero - Chavo tried to ground Cara early with moves like an armbar only for him to slip out & gave several hip tosses followed by a twisting dive over the top rope to the floor & landed on his feet.  Cara showcased more aerial offense with his head scissors onto Chavo on the floor & later in the ring, a top rope moonsault in the ring, huge elevated dropkick, a dive off the top rope onto the floor on Chavo, and handspring elbow off the ropes.  Chavo attempted the Gory Guerrero Special but Cara again slipped out & unfortunately botched the finisher resulting in Chavo falling flat on his face.  This was really just designed to showcase Sin Cara with Chavo only being the body for Cara to do his spots on which worked on many levels except for the ending.

Tag Team Champions Kane & Big Show vs. C.M. Punk & Mason Ryan - Before the match, Alberto Del Rio appeared to say some words only to be bullied out of the ring by Show & Kane...right after airing a commercial for their anti-bullying campaign ""Be A Star.""  Mason (who was getting chants of ""Batista"") showed his strength early  against Kane by showing him down & bodyslamming him right off the bat.  Punk tagged in with gave the advantage to Kane & Show who beat him up right away forcing Punk to tag Ryan back in to get their advantage back.  Punk did a bunch of ""Macho Man"" mannerisms during the match including an attempted top rope elbow drop that missed before Ryan had to be put down with the double chokeslam for the victory.  This was a nice tag match that did it's job in showcasing Mason as a powerhouse.
Another side note here but this is another match to put on mute as Cole went on a filibuster here that was just too much.

Divas Champion Brie Bella vs. Kelly Kelly - This wasn't really much of anything past some nice moves by Kelly such as an attempted Tarantula before later being backdropped over the top rope & hitting her face on the apron with Brie attempting to work over her arm for a short time.

World Champion Randy Orton vs. Christian - Both Lawler & Cole left to get ready for their match leaving Josh & Booker to do the commentary.  They did some nice early back & forth wrestling with Christian backdropping Orton over the ropes then dropkicking him through the ropes before Orton later came back with a giant suplex from the top rope that ended up hurting his own head in the process.  Both men went back & forth with their counters & strikes coming so close with their near falls including one moment with Christian escaping Orton's hanging DDT to later execute a flying headbutt that I haven't seen done since Chris Benoit.  The announcers tried to put it over that the crowd was split when you could clearly hear ""Let's Go Christian!"" as Randy Orton pulled out a new submission in the reverse Boston Crab (or Colt Cabana's ""Billy Goat's Curse"").  Both men kept blocking each others signature moves & turning them into counters such a Christian's double foot kick in the corner into a hanging DDT, Christian's attempted spear into a snap powerslam by Orton, Orton's punt into a spear, and going back & forth between the Killswitch & RKO.  This was definitely the match of the night as these two meshed well together in one of those performances that have both men walking out with more credibility than they did going in as Christian was able to pull more out of Orton than others have been able to.

Kiss My Foot Match: Jerry Lawler vs. Michael Cole - On top of the foot stipulation, Lawler would be forced to induct Cole into the WWE Hall Of Fame & give him his HOF ring if he lost.  After Cole attempted to get out of the match, we finally got Lawler beating the hell out of Cole including him getting tossed through the ""ColeMine"" before Lawler let everyone who Cole disrespected over the past few months (Eve & Jim Ross) get their revenge in the process.  Afterwords Cole tried to run away before kissing Lawler's foot which brought out a nice surprise in Bret Hart (think back to King Of The Ring '95) to make sure Cole faced the agony of de-feet.  This was the ""match"" that we should have gotten back at WrestleMania where he was just an entertaining segment that didn't go too long & gave the people exactly what they wanted...Cole getting his butt kicked.

""I Quit"" Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. The Miz - Jim Ross joined Booker & Josh on commentary for this match while before the match started, Miz made it clear that it would be a glorified handicap match as Alex Riley was going to assist him during the match.  Cena tried to go for an STF right away with Riley breaking it up while later beating the hell out of Cena with his suitcase after giving Miz an Attitude Adjustment & teaming together to double team powerbomb Cena off the top rope.  Being thrown into the guardrail various times, beat up with monitors, DDT'd on the steps was some of the punishment Cena was taking as Miz kept threatening Cena to quit before inflicting more while dictating to him what he was going to do.  Having the steel steps dropped on him, being caned across his midsection & once to the head, whipped with a belt, Skull Crushing Finale on a chair wedged between the ropes and Cena refused to quit causing Miz trying to intimidate a fan in the front row to tell Cena to quit but he refused to as well.  The finish of the match will give you flashbacks to one of the most famous ""I Quit"" matches in history but it went downhill from there as Cena ""Hulked Up"" & went crazy taking out Alex Riley before going after Miz in a way that just gave me flashbacks to their matches in 2009 where Miz was completely embarrassed.  I'll give this match credit in how brutal of a beating Cena took while Miz came off like a villain in a movie who dictated how he was going to kill you before he did it but it was the stereotypical Cena performance where he took his beating only to come back ""no selling"" like nothing happened in the past 15-20 minutes only to easily beat Miz in a way that just came off bad to me.

Overall this event was only good for continuing storylines & making attempts to showcase certain wrestlers (Ezekel Jackson, Mason Ryan, Sin Cara) while finishing up other long term stories as well but the only real memorable match when it was said & done was Orton & Christian so this is worth going out of the way if your a fan of those two but past that, I would rent this or buy it if you have some spare cash.",1306713600,7,8160,4.429525718102872

Spoilers

1. REY MYSTERIO VS R-TRUTH-this was a great opening match that was putting Truth over as a heel. I miss this time period for him as I thought he was great at it. Truth would spend time grounding Rey and slowing him down as Rey wanted to be all over the place. In the end Truth gets the victory but I still feel like if given more time these two could have done so much more.

2.[I-C TITLE]WADE BARRETT VS EZEKEL JACKSON-this match was all about the Corre and Jackson recently being kicked out of the group. I have always loved Barrett and was rooting for him here as he took on the powerhouse. This match is a bit slow and kinda reminds me of the old school matches. The crowd starts to come alive as the match goes on especially when Jackson puts Wade in the torture rack. But The Corre comes down to save the title as Barrett is DQd, they then start to beat Jackson down.

3. SIN CARA VS CHAVO GUERRERO-I am a big fan of Sin Cara [Mistico, but also like the new one] and think he is absolutely talented. So when I was watching this I was probably more excited for this match more than any other. The match its self was a good one but not the best from either man. Chavo was trying to slow Cara down but Cara showcased his abilities well. He showed off his skills like going from the top rope to the outside getting major air. After a good match over all but in all honesty these two could have delivered a classic, Sin Cara gets the victory.

4.[TAG TITLES]KANE & BIG SHOW VS CM PUNK & MASON RYAN-this was during the time when CM Punk was the leader of The New Nexus. This was a good tag match with The Nexus really shining here as Punk made the match and Ryan showcased his strength. Most say this match should have been on Raw but I thought it was a good match. Big Show and Kane keep the belts after a double choke slam on Ryan. Punks face after the match was excellent.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]BRIE BELLA VS KELLY KELLY-this was your typical Divas match that could have been on Raw or something. I hate saying that but it is true. I have seen both do better and worse so over all it was ok. Bella keeps the belt here after her sister gets involved.

6.[WORLD TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS CHRISTIAN-easily the best match of the night as these two just work excellent together. This is the definition of a back and forth match with each countering the other various times. The action is fast paced and it seems like one is going to beat the other only for the other to come back and vice versa. Randy [despite what I was wanting] retains the title but Christian looked excellent in defeat here.

7.[KISS MY FOOT MATCH]JERRY LAWLER VS MICHAEL COLE-this match was just all about Lawler getting his revenge on Cole after everything that had happened. Cole tries to get out of it right from the start but  the ref aint having it. Jerry of course just runs right through him and his Colemine. Before all is said and done The King brings out Jim Ross and Eve so they can get a little payback but the best is yet to come. The man who beat Lawler himself in this type of match Bret The Hitman Hart stops Cole from escaping and Lawler gets his royal feet kissed.

8.[WWE TITLE I QUIT MATCH]JOHN CENA VS THE MIZ-for most of this match it is basically a John Cena beat down. Miz and Alex Reilly continue to beat on Cena while trying to get him to say I Quit. Things get brutal especially if you are a Cena fan as he gets torn into. Then moment comes when Cena says the words, except he didnt. The recording Miz had only fools the ref for so long and then the match is restarted. Of course this is where Cena comes to life getting that second wind even after the beating he just took and wins. This match was entertaining for the beat down but had a typical ending.

BONUS

1.[TRIPLE THREAT # 1 CONTENDERS MATCH]REY MYSTERIO VS ALBERTO DEL RIO VS THE MIZ-this match happened on Raw and was the match that put the Miz in the main event of Over the Limit. This was a good match especially for Raw. I am glad they gave them time as well since it made it feel more important. Of course it starts out with Rey being double teamed as he was the only face. But once they got going it was every man for themselves. Each man controls for a good portion of the match starting with the Miz. From there it goes to Del Rio and onto Rey then they all trade momentum until Miz rolls Rey up for the pin. After the match Cena comes out to make his announcement for the match followed by R-Truth attacking Rey.

2. BRIE BELLA VS KELLY KELLY-this was a better than average Raw Divas match. The story here was if Kelly could win she would get a title shot. Of course after showing off her skills she gets the win and gets the title shot. After the match Kharma comes out and lays the Bellas out.

3.[NO HOLDS BARRED]JOHN CENA VS JACK SWAGGER-this was a pretty good match from Raw that would see Swagger look really good against the champ. He really takes it to Cena wearing him down and beating him down. Still with Miz and Alex looking on Cena still pulls out the victory forcing Swagger to tap.

4.[KISS MY FOOT MATCH]BRET HART VS JERRY LAWLER-this was the first kiss my foot match back from the 1995 King of the Ring PPV. I remember when this match first happened my brother and I were waiting for this match all night. Bret is one of the all time greats and my brothers favorite wrestler ever. This is a good match between these two in the middle of their long lasting feud. Good action typical of their matches with momentum trading from time to time. Hakushi tries to get involved only for it to back fire with Hart eventually getting Lawler to submit to the sharpshooter. Of course Lawler has to kiss Brets foot and then his own nasty looking foot.

You get a John Cena interview, Lawler and Coles contract signing, and a great segment featuring R-Truth, Bret Hart, and John Cena as other special features. This was a good event over all with some good matches and great bonus features on the Blu-ray. I would recommend this to any wrestling fan.",1401148800,,6044,4.265502183406114
