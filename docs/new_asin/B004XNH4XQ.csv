4496567,5,B004XNH4XQ,"When I saw the advertisement for the live show last October, I just couldn't resist the excitement of having the MST3K crew making fun of movies again. Of course, I though to myself, ""this is too good to be true, they're probably not as hilarious as they used to be.""

Boy was I wrong, I was pissing my pants off when I went to watch this ""Riff"" live last October. I hope the guys keep on doing these, because I'll make sure to go to every one they make (: I really recommend this film Riff to anyone fond of good humor and making fun of small details in good or bad movies.",1305676800,3,574,4.079646017699115
4496568,5,B004XNH4XQ,"My 2 sons & I saw this live in the theater last October. I haven't laughed this hard at the movies since I saw ""Airplane"" in theaters so many years ago. This will be one of the memories that I'll have of my boys when they were 12 & 14: Looking over at them laughing so hard that they were practically doubled over in their seats. The 2 shorts included are worth the price of admission even without HoHH. A MUST SEE for fans of MST3K & clever humor. We've been waiting on this since October!",1305590400,9,490,4.114583333333333
4496569,5,B004XNH4XQ,"""Paper & I,"" a supremely creepy short film about a young boy's attachment to a talking paper bag, is scarier than anything in ""House on Haunted Hill,"" a goofy William Castle cross between ""Diabolique"" and ""Ten Little Indians."" HoHH is great fun with the riffing, especially when Elisha Cook's nebbish character comes under fire, but you never forget for a moment that you're watching a creaky melodrama that's trying with all its might (and failing miserably) to be scary. By contrast, the ""Paper"" short and ""Magical Disappearing Money,"" in which a supermarket witch uses her dark powers to make shoppers save money on a variety of unappealing groceries, seem to've gone straight from the filmmakers' id to the camera, pausing only to be enacted by a cast of dazed amateurs.

The feature film is entertaining, but the two shorts are filmmaking at its most crazed. What's not to like?",1419984000,2,883,4.926174496644295

4496571,4,B004XNH4XQ,"I have the studio version of this movie, and the live. They're very similar, but different enough that I'm glad I have them both. For one thing, the live version is colorized, and it's a pretty good job. The addition of an outside comic, one Paul F. Thompkins, raises the laugh factor by about seven, in the places we see him.

It helps that I just plain like this movie, riffed or un-.",1402185600,,386,4.287671232876712
4496572,5,B004XNH4XQ,I was lucky enough to catch the Rifftrax Live show in San Francisco--honestly was THE funniest thing I have EVER seen in a theatre! This DVD let me re-live those funny moments and it is fine for older kids-my teenage nieces thought Vincent Price was a riot and we all loved the cheesiness of this classic horror film,1395360000,,316,4.4655172413793105
4496573,5,B004XNH4XQ,"I am a big fan of the MST3K guys and love their work on RiffTrax.  And I adore the Vincent Price film ""House on Haunted Hill"".  And when you put them together, you have a fun filled evening.  My husband and I have watched it and also shown it to my sister and her family and it is a very funny job of riffing.",1391212800,,309,3.796875
4496574,5,B004XNH4XQ,"As someone that had purchased the non-Live version, I was worried about purchasing this one in fear that there would be too many repeat jokes.  That fear could not have been more wrong given the addition of the two movie shorts (which were hysterical) and the new commentary on House on Haunted Hill.  As a HUGE fan of the film, to have its many peculiarities and plot holes teased incessantly by the Riff Trax crew was a delight!  My whole family - as even my daughters adored this presentation - collected with friends during a Halloween party to watch the show and could not have had a better time!  If you love MST3K or Riff Trax, MAKE SURE TO GET THIS as it is fantastically funny!",1385337600,,686,4.420634920634921
4496575,4,B004XNH4XQ,"Filmed in Nashville in 2010 before a very appreciative live theater audience, and simulcast to over 400 theaters nation-wide, you can feel the spontaneous crowd-generated energy in this sometimes very-funny Rifftrax treatment of the Vincent Price camp classic. Funnier and edgier, with more jokes-per-frame than the relatively staid studio version from 2009, this program includes two typically weird little short films as appetizers before the main course, and a somewhat pointless guest appearance by comedian Paul F. Tompkins.

The original 1958 version of ""House on Haunted Hill"" may not exactly cry out for the RiffTrax treatment, but, I have to say, after watching Nelson, Murphy and Corbett do their thing, it probably had it coming. The William Castle-directed Vincent Price vehicle has lost a good deal of its original shock-value over the decades--let's face it, we're just not as easily scared as we used to be--but it does have its potentially funny moments, mainly because it tends to take itself just a wee bit too seriously. None of the actors are outstamdingly bad; they're just stuck with a stilted and rather cheesy script, and are doing what they can to make the best of a thankless gig. Vincent Price is watchable in whatever he's in, and while I wouldn't go so far as to say that he brings ""dignity"" to his role, he nonetheless plays it with such oily charm and schmaltzy menace that we can almost imagine him winking at us, letting us know he really does get how silly this stuff is. (Heck! Given Price's legendary sense of humor, you can almost imagine his ghost joining in on the riffing.) Elisha Cook, Richard Long, and Carol Ohmart aren't too terrible either, but, like the characters they portray, are simply trapped for the duration.

As with most Rifftrax DVDs, special features are minimal and don't add a whole lot to the experience.  Unlike the 2009 studio production, this disc features a colorized version of ""House on Haunted Hill"", but does not include an additional ""un-riffed"" version of the original film.

Recommended.",1382918400,,2058,5.008771929824562
4496576,4,B004XNH4XQ,"Now, I already have the Rifftrax version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RiffTrax-House-on-Haunted-Hill-from-the-stars-of-Mystery-Science-Theater-3000/dp/B0026KJP76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RiffTrax: House on Haunted Hill - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000!</a>.  This is the live version done in 2011, don't get them confused.  This DVD was recorded live and has also two shorts, Paper And I, about the life cycle of a paper bag (no, not kidding) and Magical Disappearing Money, about a supermarket witch who explains how you can save big bucks by buying the store's non-brand stuff.  Well, DUH.
The DVD is funny but there is the live audience which can sometimes drown out the gang.  And also a lot of cultural references which, while making it funny, can age it (like the rest of the MST3K flicks).  In other words, this is not a gift DVD, this is a DVD for yourself.  A fan DVD.  So get it!  What are you waiting for?  Even if you have the other version this is almost brand new material.  With guest riffer Paul F. Tompkins (who also starred in one of the shorts in one of my Doctor Who DVDs).  Enjoy!",1382659200,,1166,5.316939890710382
4496577,5,B004XNH4XQ,"I may be assuming here but I wanted to check....I have this movie on Legend Films DVD (colorized)...I really want this blu-ray to get the best picture/clarity, not really the Rifftrax....I don't mind having it to listen to, however, I want to be sure that the Rifftrax audio can be unselected to just watch the movie in glorious blu-ray....can anyone owning this tell me?",1382572800,,371,4.8125
4496578,4,B004XNH4XQ,"Definitely one of the funnier Rifftrax episodes as they take on a classic Vincent Price film.  The two short films that are in front of the main feature are some of the funniest stuff that they've ever done.  I thought that the live presentation was a bit better than Birdemic, but there's very little to complain about with this episode.",1377475200,,338,4.616666666666666
4496579,5,B004XNH4XQ,"I am writing this review assuming that most everyone that will wath this rifftrax live has seen House on haunted Hill before, if you have not I suggest watching a release without the commentary. House on Haunted Hill is a classic william castle film and vincent price is just icing, but my only complaint about this and all rifftrax is that the commentary overpowers all sound from the movie and takes away more than it gives. MST3k usually had the commentary and movie soundtrack at about the same level adjusting for certain moments of the film. That didn't take away from the movie and still made for hilarious comments to be made. That being said, this live rifftrax is hillarious and I can no longer look at the owner of the house the same. This may have been performed on Halloween, but if you want to add a scary twist to a St. Patricks day, just watch and youll be be laughing your head off.",1363305600,,899,4.454545454545454
4496580,5,B004XNH4XQ,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is something new to me.  But it is fun.  It is a movie, a bad one with a couple of guys riffing it.  If you do not know what that is, well you know how when you watch a bad movie with your friends and you make fun of it through out the movie... well there you go.  That is what a riff is.  They say funny things about the mistakes in the movie, and bad acting and whatever else they find that is funny.",1362182400,,431,3.797752808988764
4496581,4,B004XNH4XQ,"I was excited to get the movie and watch it with my family. The jokes were kind of boring compared to the ones I saw live. It kind of dragged on a bit, but was a cool part of my collection. The case was smashed so I can't really close it, which is fine, because I keep my movies in a DVD case",1360108800,,292,3.6507936507936507
4496582,4,B004XNH4XQ,"I'll cut to the chase.  As someone who owns and loves the Rifftrax of House on Haunted Hill, I was holding off on this because I didn't think I'd enjoy seeing a live riffing of a movie I already have a Rifftrax version of.  ""Afterall,"" I thought, ""won't it just be the same riffs with audience laughter and the occasional line flub?""

No!  Mike, Kevin and Bill really do bother to give us a show.  Not only do you get two great shorts (the grocery witch short is now one of our personal favorites, my wife quotes from it often), an actually funny guest appearance by Paul F. Tompkins (a great comedian, see his stand-up act somewhere if you can) who tags along for a short and has a brief cameo during the actual movie, but the live cut on House on Haunted Hill is very worth it in that OVER HALF the riffs are BRAND NEW!  It is NOT a re-hash of the original Rifftrax, and my wife and I both agreed the new material is actually funnier, and this is coming from two people who love the regular DVD.

My one and only complaint is they play the colorized version of the movie.  While the colorization here looks much better than it used to when they first started using the technology, the fact ramains that HoHH just works so much better in black and white, the light and shadow of the black and white cinematography lend a ton to the atmosphere to the film and the spook-show shenanigans just don't work very well without it.

But that's relatively minor.  If you liked the original Rifftrax of HoHH, this live version is not a simple repeat of material.  The two shorts are excellent, the guest star is funny, and the movie itself has a substantial amount of new (excellent) riffing.  Tons of fun!",1350950400,10,1697,4.369426751592357
4496583,2,B004XNH4XQ,"This could have been better had it included the original movie ""unriffed"" in high def, but overall this title falls short for it's main purpose... hearing the riffs!!!  The audience laughter tends to drown-out much of the riffing and took away from the enjoyment of the film.  It seems a bit harder to listen to the film, and the riffs, AND the audience and still enjoy it.  The random split screen to see the guys was... meh.  The shorts were great, but here is my question; if you cannot watch the entire film in 1080p stand-alone, why buy this on blu-ray? to see Michael J Nelsons' pores on his face?  I like the guys, i like their work and enjoy their comedy, but this isn't worth owning over a DVD version.",1340496000,4,711,4.396946564885496
4496584,5,B004XNH4XQ,"Despite my poor attempt at a clever title, the Rifftrax crew is back live to riff a Vincent Price classic known as House On Haunted Hill. They also have two shorts to rip to shreds, Magical Disappearing Money which is about some drunk aunt as a witch in bad make-up trying to help people in the '70's save money on food rather than throw it away on more expensive and better food items. This one is gold for the guys as they just have a blast with the material especially making fun of the blank expressions on the actors faces and the ""witch"".

The second short sees comedian Paul F. Tompkins join the guys and its called ""Paper & I"", where a young boy has a seemingly beyond creepy attachment to a brown paper bag, so this bag comes to life at night and takes him to forests in the south, then to a paper mill all in an attempt to show him how paper is made. Also much like MST3K's ""A Case of Spring Fever"" the bag shows him what life would be like without paper. This is the funnier of the two shorts as its so badly acted and creepy that the guys just have a great old time with it.

The main feature is the movie which isn't a horrible film, but the acting is a bit stale and the laughable scares do make for good riffing. The guys have fun with a lot of the wholes in the movie and mainly target Lance, the test pilot who keeps falling over his own feet and hurting himself and Nora the plain jane who is so scared yet seems to just keep looking for ways to be more scared.

Like other Rifftrax live dvds the audience being there to laugh at the jokes does give it a cool feel unlike the standard yet hilarious Rifftrax dvds. Its a great one that unlike the Plan 9 live one is more comedy and less show segment based.",1333324800,2,1723,4.106824925816023
4496585,5,B004XNH4XQ,This version is not only better than the original because it's on Blu Ray; it's better because of 2 hilarious shorts and some real change-ups in the gang's riffs.  They do a masterful job once again and add in a surprise 4th riffer!,1316736000,,232,4.395348837209302
4496586,4,B004XNH4XQ,"I am a big fan of MST3K and Rifftrax.  Also being a fan of House on Haunted Hill, made this disk a no-brainer to buy.  It is funny and the riffing is up to the usual Rifftrax standards.  However, it is important to know that this was a recording from a live performance.  This means that you have the audience's reaction also recorded.  This can interfere with listening to the movie and the riffing.  There were times when the audience's laughter covered up a nice set up in the movie and the subsequent riffing.

I would have liked this a lot more if it was just the movie and the riffing.  However, keeping that in mind, this is still a good entertaining disk.

I only hope Rifftrax releases more movies, but this time without the audience distractions.",1316563200,2,756,4.45985401459854
4496587,5,B004XNH4XQ,"I greatly enjoyed the Rifftrax DVD of HoHH released earlier. And when I found out Rifftrax live would be in near where I lived I just had to see this. And I'm glad I did. The theater was a roar with laughter as the guys riffed to very interesting shorts & the movie itself. The shorts are ""Magic Disappearing Money"" (about witch showing people how to save money when buying groceries) and ""Paper and I"" (about a kid haunted by talking paper bag that educates him on the making of paper & it's importance to the world). They're just as silly as they sound and the guys make excellent use of them. Then there's the movie. Even you've seen.own the earlier DVD, there are several key differences that keep this edition from being stale, like the movie being in color, several new riffs and the appearance of Paul F. Thompkins to help with the riffing. A great addition to any MYSTY's collection!",1311206400,,891,4.506172839506172
4496588,4,B004XNH4XQ,I love their shows but I don't understand why they feel the need to bring in extra people. The comedian they brought in added little to the show except a long rambling bit that was ultimately not that funny. I felt the same when they brought in Weird Al for an earlier show.

8447249,3,B004XNH4XQ,"I will say first off, the issues were not with the show itself. This show is hilarious, as to be expected from the cast of MST3K. My issue is with the DVD. I've bought this DVD twice and both times, it starts stopping half way through, to the point where it becomes impossible to finish. I've checked them for scratches and dust but I can't figure out the issue. Again, the show is fabulous. I got to work it once and I thoroughly enjoyed it and I haven't had this issue with any other Rifftrax DVD. I don't know if its just my bad luck but I'd be careful with this one.",1512086400,,570,4.098214285714286
