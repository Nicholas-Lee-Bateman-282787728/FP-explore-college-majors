8296774,4,B001E6PI3S,"I was surprised by this unexpected interpretation of the classic Poe tale. In searching for a filmed version of ""Fall of the House of Usher,"" I found this item and became interested, knowing that it was not a color-splashed version of a dark, frightening story. Even though I appreciated this austere approach to capturing the mood of the story, younger viewers were not as impressed--having as their only reference points the video technologies that saturate movie-making today. For me, this version created an aura of its own and gave me the freedom to respond from my own nightmares and daytime fears.",1357862400,,604,4.99009900990099
