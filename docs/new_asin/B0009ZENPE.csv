8201290,4,B0009ZENPE,"Very well-done hour-long documentary on King's College Choir (and the chapel itself).  This ran on American television back in the 1980's.  The sound is satisfactory, but the picture is not the clearest.  But the content makes up for that.",1435795200,,239,5.076923076923077
8201291,3,B0009ZENPE,Rather poor image quality. Sound is fine though. DVDs by King's College are always worth purchasing. I am glad I did.,1366070400,,117,4.619047619047619
