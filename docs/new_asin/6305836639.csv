7896002,1,6305836639,"Boring, predictable cop show with little variation on an old theme.  Good cops die chasing a very bad guy after he escapes again from the Best the Force can field and another partner who survived the gun down decides to add a few notches to his pistola,  but is continually warned, ""don't shoot the bad guy he has something we want.  Familiar and old theme of capture the bad guys without killing 'em!",1430438400,,401,4.465753424657534
7896003,1,6305836639,"Danny Trejo has many credits under his belt.  Many must love him, including myself.  Still, he is in big trouble if this mess of a movie is what happens when he's a main character.  Maybe like Paul Lynde, he really has to be to the sides and not at the front of the line.

Let me mention just one scene that illustrates the silliness of this film.  Trejo's character takes a female intern hostage as he flees a hospital.  You hear all this female screaming and pleading, but the actress' mouth never moves while she is being hauled away.  Trejo is walking slowly with an unwilling hostage yet the police are unable to catch up with him.  Trejo has been in prison for years, yet he can shoot effectively with a hostage in one hand and the police get hit with his bullets left and right and do fake ""I'm shot!"" movements all over.

A hardcore Trejo fan may want to see this, but anyone else probably won't be able to stomach it.",1196467200,6,926,4.30635838150289
