8622790,5,B000WOVF80,Wasn't able to go to the Brownsville revival so was interested in experiencing it as much as possible. The praise songs are wonderful & I try to play it at least once daily. Often wake in the night with some of the songs going through my head. Friends who have visited me began dancing and praising the Lord and said they wanted to do it next time they visit. Great way to build up one's spirit. Highly recommend it.,1412640000,,416,4.2784810126582276
