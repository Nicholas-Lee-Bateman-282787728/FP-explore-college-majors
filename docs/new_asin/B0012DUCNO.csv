8245347,5,B0012DUCNO,"I just visited Yellowstone National Park and this DVD provides excellent video of the scenes. It's strictly providing the pictures of the attractions.

The Upper Falls and Lower Falls are beautiful. The colors on the video is not that perfect. I guess it's not filmed in sunny early morning. I still gave it five stars because you can see the fantastic scenes in 45 minutes.",1279324800,,374,4.753846153846154
