The acting was ok.  I LOVED the roll of Jeffrey, how cool is a little retarded person that can play the violin?  I bet the actor is a real genious.  I'm so happy amazon is re-releasing this movie. I think everyone should buy a copy!  It's a classic of B-horror movies!",971740800,3,466,4.076923076923077
7899560,2,630597215X,"MIRROR MIRROR was a nifty little thriller with a seriously downer open ending which screamed for a sequel. Then MIRROR MIRROR 2 shows up, and it has nothing to do with the first film?  The cast is fine, though the mute child is both annoying and been done to death a thousand times. The story is a bit confusing as a teen girl (MR. BELVEDEER's Tracey Wells)gets blinded by the mirror from hell as it electrocutes a satanic heavy metal band playing at her church (huh! )and freaks out her little bro. Little kids in parell are supposed to make the film scarrier, right? Well, no. This ain't THE BAD SEED or THE BROOD, so lose the kid. Tracey mostly wines a lot about being blind while a mysterious hunk keeps popping out of crawlspaces in the church walls because... well, I don't know why. He's not disfigured or psychotic, so I guess he's just a peeping tom. Meanwhile nasty step-sister Sally Kellerman plans to do evil things to Wells with the help of Roddy McDowell, and all while Veronica Cartwright babbles about evil. A great cast, also including Sarah Douglas, is completely wasted in a movie which isn't scary and seems to have a 3 hour running time (though it's only 90 minutes). Unfortunately, things get much lamer in Part 3.",969753600,,1236,4.5675675675675675
