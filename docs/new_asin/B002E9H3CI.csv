3915754,5,B002E9H3CI,"What a thoroughly enjoyable experience! This turns out to be one of Handel's most accessible scores with some of his most endearing arias as well as a few duets and concerted pieces. The fragile plot enfolds like a Shakespearean comedy with mistaken and supressed identities , cross dressing, twists of plot, pangs and pains of love and all turns out for the best in the end. The production itself is a miracle of modern direction; no Eurotrash here. The walls of Naples which figure in the play as part of the drama move now here and now there; even pushed aside at one point by the Queen herself. The famous war scene of Act 2 is cleverly done as a sort of musical chairs with appropriate clashes and bangs. There are six characters and all have a chance to show off their considerable skills both in acting and singing in this most convincing score. This is one Handel opera in which I did not find some ""dry"" spots. For this reason and by the totally dedicated efforts of conductor, musicians, singers and staff the whole exercise goes by most rapidly and happily. What fun!",1257292800,10,1078,4.561855670103093
3915755,4,B002E9H3CI,"Unfortunately, I'll treat the bad parts first since they are much less fun and I want to get them out of the way.  :-)

As is well-known at this point by most people who'd be grabbing this thing quickly, they had a few problems during the production.  :-)  The rather complex sets malfunctioned a few times, and Scholl unfortunately came down with a cold before the premiere that both prevented him from being at his best until the very end, and that communicated itself rapidly throughout the cast (for reasons that will be glaringly obvious once you've seen the DVD).  The editing was therefore a challenge since there was no single performance where everyone was in top form.  Unfortunately, it shows in some places; there are a few significant five-to-ten-second chunks where it was obvious that they had no really good footage or had to use sound from one performance and footage from another.  Other than that, the camerawork was just ... intrusive in my opinion.  I tend to prefer live performances (such as the Cesare DVD) that are filmed in a more conventional three-camera sitcom style, where the mixing of close and medium shots is much less ... pushy.  Editing live performances as if they were TV shows tends to make the actors look overblown and hammy since they are acting more broadly for people in faraway seats.  Pull back a bit more next time, and give the performers some room.

Other than these considerations, there's also the fact that the score is not one of Haendel's best.  Perhaps I should say that it was a bit more experimental for him, sort of attempting a more buffa-style opera with seria conventions.  Unlike with his other operas, there were no arias that I hummed to myself after having watched the DVD.  The music was lovely and pleasant, but with limited exceptions (mostly the opening of Act III), it didn't ""stick"" as firmly as Haendel's other scores.  (One bright spot though is the larger number of pieces where multiple voices are working at once and even a few spots where the plot was advanced through the arias, not typical for seria work.  Neat!)

Okay, that's the bad out of the way.  Now for the good stuff that makes this DVD more than worth owning despite what I've just said.  Once again, this is the Royal Danish, and these are without a doubt the finest ensemble of voices I've ever heard.  I'm picky.  I grew up with opera, and while I can sometimes forgive a less than stellar singer if they can act, it doesn't happen often.  Here, every single person was fully present in their role, and every single voice was magnificent (with the editing to help avoid the colds).  Dam-Jensen and Semmingsen are two sopranos that I am considering flying to Denmark to hear live since they don't seem to travel much.  That's a huge outlay of money and time, but I'm ready to make it.  I've already heard the celestial Scholl live and want to do so again when he's at the Met in 2011, and Christophe Dumaux, previously unfamiliar to me, shone like an unexpected diamond in this thing.  He was fabulous.  Bo Jensen had a nice clear ringing voice that reminded me of Paul Nilon, and of course Palle Knudsen was rich and and textured and sounded like auditory Irish coffee as always.

Every single voice was perfect, and every single actor was brilliant.  Not one weak spot anywhere.  In a comedy, that's twice as hard.  Singing is easier than comic timing.  :-)

Then, there's the story which unfortunately most opera fans tend to ignore since we all know this stuff by heart anyhow, but I'd like to consider the story for people who aren't familiar with it.  Most people know opera through the Romantic stuff, which much as I love it, can come across like cheesy tragic romance novels.  But this opera was written well before the Parade of Tragic Dead Chicks got started.  Lovers make both stupid and sensible choices, and people are rewarded and punished for their own merits and faults.  You are never left rolling your eyes at the screen.  Characters have plausible problems, good and bad sides; they aren't archetypes, they're people.  Arsace is loving but ditzy and flighty.  Rosmira is faithful but angry.  Partenope is kind and just but also a bit of a dipstick.  Armindo is sweet but lacks confidence.  Everyone is textured and realistic, and everyone learns the lesson they need to learn.  It's a fabulous, complicated, fun story -- not deep, not sweeping, not on the scale of grand opera.  It's a fetching tale of two attractive pairs of lovers who have to get slapped with the dead fish of common sense a few times before things settle out, and it's both pleasant and fun.

And just because I need to say it ... Tuva doesn't get her kit off in the production.  1.5 chests are bared, and fully 1.5 of them belong to men.  (One is a very well-built young non-singing actor, and the point-five is none other than Andreas Scholl.  The DVD cover may help sell it to men, but THAT'll help sell it to women!)

Another huge plus ... behind-the-scenes features!!!!  I remember complaining a bit about this in my review of the Glyndebourne ""Rodelinda.""  I have more than my share of opera DVDs, but they haven't yet caught up to the movie DVDs in terms of their meet-the-actors and behind-the-scenes featurettes.  This one finally begins to address that lack, apparently thanks to Andreas Scholl who wandered around with a microphone collaring people during the rehearsals.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I truly hope that more opera productions begin taking these sorts of BTS things more seriously and including not only little interviews but some filming of the set design meetings, talks with the musicians, or even filming some set construction, and little featurettes about the operas and their history -- perhaps interviews with music history types from nearby universities who can give a little interview on the history of the opera, who first performed in it, and where it was premiered.

So again -- a little bad mixed in with the good, but still a marvelous DVD and one that I can recommend strongly.  Four stars is pretty damn good when you get right down to it.  Buy this thing -- you will absolutely not regret it!",1257033600,20,6164,4.707476635514019
3915756,5,B002E9H3CI,"I went to see this opera 6 times (plus one dress rehearsal) in Copenhagen, so I was all too aware of the fact that the production was cursed. Andreas Scholl wasn't on form until the last few performances and Tuva Semmingsen missed 4 performances out of a total of 8, due to a sore throat. Consequently, there wasn't one single performance where all 6 singers were at their best. The fact that that goes by (almost) unnoticed on this DVD is due to the editing. It also goes a long way in explaining the numerous closeups and odd angles used by the editors - they must have had to be rather creative.

The DVD captures everything that was great about this production - great singing and acting by all involved and I even spotted a few details that I had missed on all my live viewings, despite owning a great pair of binoculars. It is both moving and hilarious. The staging is modern but very unobtrusive. Concerto Copenhagen are amazing as always and it's a joy to watch Lars Ulrik Mortensen 'conduct' from behind the harpsicord.

I feared that the sound would be marred by the extensive cutting and splicing that must have taken place for the puzzle to work out, but I need not have worried.

I highly recommend this DVD - even if you're weary of baroque opera. The battle scene alone is worth the price of 'admission' and had the audience in tears of laughter for every performance. See Paul Van de Water's review for more details.

If you like this DVD, I would also like to recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-Giulio-Cesare/dp/B000S6EUAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel - Giulio Cesare</a>. It was released around the same time as David McVicar's Giulio Cesare from Glyndebourne, which is hard to compete with. I own DVDs of both productions and they are most certainly not mutually exclusive.
Four of the singers from Partenope took part in the Danish Cesare production, along with the director, the conductor and orchestra).",1254009600,50,1988,4.978915662650603
3915757,5,B002E9H3CI,"Partenope wasn't a success upon its premiere in 1730.  It doesn't have the drama of Giulio Cesare or Serse or the magic of Alcina or Orlando.  But this sophisticated comedy has recently come into its own.  Sigiswald Kuijken and La Petite Bande kicked off the revival with a path-breaking audio recording in 1979.  Since 1998 it has been a staple of the repertory at the New York City Opera.  This wonderful DVD from Copenhagen's Royal Theater will solidify Partenope's modern reputation.

Partenope (Inger Dam-Jensen) is the queen and legendary founder of the city of Naples (also known as Parthenope).  The plot of the opera centers around the efforts of three competing suitors to win her hand.  One of the suitors (Arsace, played by Andreas Scholl) has jilted a former lover (Rosmira, sung by Tuva Semmingsen), who tries to win him back and shows up in Partenope's court disguised as a foreign prince.  There's not a whole lot of action (except for a battle scene, discussed below), but there's plenty of clever repartee and beautiful music.

The musical production, under the direction of Lars Ulrik Mortensen, is superb.  Mortensen is known to us primarily as a harpsichordist through his recordings of Bach, Buxtehude, and other baroque masters.  Here he leads the period band Concerto Copenhagen and a star-studded sextet of soloists in a virtually flawless performance.

Francisco Negrin's direction is restrained, unmannered, and highly effective.  No Eurotrash here.  The setting is a stylized version of Partenope's palace.  Most of the characters wear modern evening dress, although Ormonte, the captain of Partenope's guard, who serves as a kind of stage manager, sports a purple suit with a fez-like hat.  The singers all display an ease and youthful vitality that make them a joy to watch and entirely believable in their respective roles.

In the battle at the beginning of Act II, Partenope and her allies defeat Emilio, prince of Cumae.  Short of a Franco Zeffirelli spectacular, battle scenes are hard to pull off on a modern stage.  In Negrin's version, the opposing forces begin with a contest of musical chairs and end with a bout of rock-paper-scissors.  A bit too cute, perhaps, but enjoyable and effective.  You can view the battle scene, as well as other excerpts from this fine production, on YouTube.

This DVD joins the list of the best Handel videos.  Recommended without reservation.  If you can't wait until it's on sale in the U.S., you can buy it on-line from the U.K.",1253664000,23,2502,5.0

8366938,4,B002E9H3CI,"I own many opera videos and this one might have the worst video director of all time.  Almost the entire opera is shown in close-up or macro close-up.  There is no sense of perspective and you rarely get to see the sets or choreography.

Technical problems aside, this is a wonderful production.  Most of the singers are Danish and they are all very good.  Andreas Scholl is the ""big name"" singer added to the cast and he is fine but the unknown singers were the most impressive.  The orchestra and conducting is all very good.

I really hate the video directing on this but since this is the only Partenope currently available on DVD, I can't afford to be choosy.

I'm glad I am able to see this opera on video since it is unlikely I will ever be able to attend a live performance.  Unfortunately not too many Handel operas get performed in my area.",1486598400,2,850,4.397435897435898

8366941,4,B002E9H3CI,"I have a soft spot for 'Partenope', a sweet, silly mid period Handel piece that was one of his first attempts at mixing opera seria with a bit of comedy. The plot is fairly thin but fun - many men fighting ineffectually for the hand of the queen Partenope who, in turn, has great fun playing them all off against each other. The more I hear the score, the more I appreciate it - there are really a great many fine arias in this piece.

Vocally, this DVD production from Copenhagen is superb. Inger Dam-Jensen's voice has grown richer and deeper since I first heard her in the Cardiff Singer of the World competition many years ago. Tuva Semmingsen has a lovely light mezzo voice (maybe just a shade too light for the role of the spurned Rosmira) and her swaggering 'male' acting is fun to watch. I like Andreas Scholl very much and if his voice is not perhaps the most dramatic, it can be staggeringly beautiful in the slower arias. He is however, in my view, surpassed by the glorious Christophe Dumaux who may be my favourite countertenor of the moment. Palle Knudsen sings both Ormonte's arias well and the tenor Bo Jensen made me realise, for the first time, how good Emilio's arias really are! The orchestra play superbly well.

The production works well on the whole I think and manages the tricky mix of comic and serious that exists in this piece. The 'battle scene' at the start of Act 2 is simply brilliant and there are many fine comic touches that hit the mark. The bizarre 'nightmare trio' in Act 3 is also a splendid bit of stagework and acting. HOWEVER, I did feel that Francisco Negrin injected rather more 'angst' than is really needed. 'Partenope' is a pretty light and airy piece and some of the over-wrought dramatics in (for example) Rosmira's hunting aria and Partenope's sublime 'Voglio amare' didn't really work at all. Partenope as a sex pest was kinda fun but as angsty mental case...not so much!

Overall though, I really enjoyed this DVD and will be returning to it many times.",1345939200,,2005,4.563888888888889
8366942,4,B002E9H3CI,"I thought this was absolutely beautiful, particularly the orchestral playing, which was as good Handel as I've heard...the conductor/harpischordist was terrific.  The plot doesn't amount to much, but this is true of many of Handel's operas.  It's the music that counts.  Perhaps the singers struggled a bit from time to time, but Handel was well served.

I have to enter a strong objection to the characterization of this production as ""Eurotrash.""  It's in modern dress, and there's a bit of pardonable foolishness, but it's far from Eurotrash.  If you want that, check out the production of Alcina in modern dress, where the soprano bares it all, and the singers spend a good deal of time groping each other.  Just horrible.  Not all modern dress productions are Eurotrash.

I wonder, when I read these reviews, why opera buffs sometimes feel they have to be so unpleasant to one another.  One can have strong opinions without being nasty.  One can be knowledgeable without being snotty about it....",1329436800,2,1001,5.006060606060606
8366943,4,B002E9H3CI,"The opera Partenope, regina di Napoli (1730) is for me the best opera composed by Georg Friedrich Hndel. I bought a performance with Lawrence Zazzo, Kurt Streit and others in CD and for me this performance in CD is better. You can find a best aureole of romantic ambiance. This performance with Andreas Scholl is very good, but in my opinion there is a lack of tenderness that is the spirit of this opera. The countertenor Andreas Scholl as Arsace is superb; his aria Sento amore con nuovi dardi is very romantic and well sung and his role has very funny grimaces. Inger Dam Jensen as Partenope is good, but doesn`t have this aureole of tenderness that we can enjoy with Hillary Summers in the another performance available in CD. Palle Knudsen as Ormonte has a charming role and you can enjoy his aria La gloria in nobil alma, which is sung by the character of Emilio in the performance available in CD, sung by Kurt Streit. Bo Jensen as Emilio in this DVD is good, but doesn't have so power and beauty in his voice like Streit. The role of Rosmira, sung by Tuva Semmingsen is good, but has many exagereted grimaces. The countertenor Christophe Dumaux in the role of Armindo is superb and his performance in the aria Nobile core makes this DVD worthy to buy it.",1284508800,2,1262,4.5152838427947595
8366944,5,B002E9H3CI,"Well, this will probably be the last opera DVD I will buy before 2010 - and it is a very enjoyable way to end the year. Andreas Scholl is fine voice here and he has some great comic skills. Christophe Dumaux looks like Eric Bana in this production! Anyway, Dumaux is a fine countertenor and his Tolomeo in the Christie ""Guilio Cesare"" was superb and characterful. He is also another singer who does comedy well.
Inger Dam Jensen plays the title role with great relish and panache. Nice soprano voice and she handles the coloratura well. Tuva Semmingsen nearly steals the show with her almost ""hammy"" portrayal of Rosmira.

Concerto Copenhagen is a fine Baroque orchestra and I hope they feature in more productions like this one.

Lars Ulrik Mortensen's direction is well paced, natural and exhibits a deep understanding of Handel's opera.

The recording is remarkably vivid and sharp. The stage sounds are a little invasive at times - we hear footsteps on the hard floor quite a few times. However, what we have here is a very vital record of a particularly good production of one of Handel's most frothy and entertaining operas.

A warm recommendation from me!",1260662400,4,1162,4.795
8366945,5,B002E9H3CI,"This is a thoroughly absurdist staging, in modern dress (more or less), with lots of lascivious postures and Ionesco-like incongruities ... exactly the sort of ""Euro-trash"" production that conservative fans love to rant against. And it's true that surreal stagings have become the norm in many European Opera Houses, especially for productions of Handel, Rameau, Vivaldi and other baroque works. But if it takes a nude or two and an atmosphere of dissolute absurdity to attract an audience, so be it! Listen up, impresarios! I'd be willing to put up with Handel staged in flour sacks on a bare stage, if it would bring us some relief from the provincial parade of Puccini, Wagner, and Verdi!

Still, it's only fair to note that this production has some obvious flaws. It has been assembled from several filmings, and the editing will be obvious to sharp-eyed and sharp-eared viewers. The camera work is too busy, and there are close-ups that focus rather distractingly on nostrils. The hammy acting gets annoying at times, especially when the camera hops away from the character singing the aria to another character upstaging the singer. The most serious flaw is the singing of Andreas Scholl, the only member of the cast with a large reputation. Scholl has often shown more skill than voice, but in this recording his voice is thin and unconvincing. Gossip has it that he was suffering a rotten head-cold or flu when the recording was made. He is certainly ""outsung"" by every other member of the mostly Danish cast.

It's also fair to say that the libretto for Partenope is unfocused and meandering, my personal choice for the weakest drama Handel ever chose to set to music. But Handel wasn't alone; the libretto, written in 1699, was set by at least ten other composers and was perennially popular in Italy, perhaps because of its implied decadence and irreverence. That would, in turn, justify the slightly raunchy staging given it by the Royal Opera House of Copenhagen. Handel's Partenope was the composer's first 'comic' opera in England. It was staged in London in 1730, but not well received by the critics. The music is good, of course, but doesn't (to my ears anyway) generate much excitement until the third act. Then it's sublime, one achingly beautiful love-aria after another, building to a climactic duet between Partenope and her true love Armindo, a duet that rivals Monteverdi's exquisite duet at the end of Poppea. By the third act, dear viewer, any resistance to the goofy staging will have dissipated; you'll be more than glad you've stayed the course. Those arias and that duet are what justify my five-star rating.

The two women in this cast -- Inger Dam-Jensen as Partenope and Tuva Semmingsen as Rosmira -- vocally as well as emotively dominate their counter-tenor lovers. As it should be, perhaps: Scholl is an utter wimp as Arsace and Cristophe Dumaux is a limp-wristed Amindo, though he sings elegantly enough. The orchestra, Concerto Copenhagen conducted by Lars Ulrik Mortensen, performs very stylishly and transparently; even the archlute can be heard at times, and the singers are never forced to bellow. But the erratic editing/assembling of the DVD does present the listeners with odd shifts in dynamics, as if suddenly the mikes had all conspired to scatter to the back of the theater.

Sooo... It's not Handel's most distinctive music, except for the last act, and it's not the most coherent modern staging, but it's well worth hearing, and likely to be the only DVD production of Partenope available for a long time.",1259452800,6,3556,4.9614093959731544
8366946,2,B002E9H3CI,"Having seen [and owned] many different Handel opera DVD-s, I know the difficulty a director faces when he/she stages a new production. Handel operas are slow-moving in their actions, the arias are repeated, and the frequent use of ""castrati"" singers represent difficulty for the audience. With all these problems, many opera directors achieve wonderful, truly enjoyable staging, with excellent singers and orchestras.

Unfortunately, this Partenope is not amongst the good ones. It is especially damning to have a good baroque orchestra with an pretty and elaborate scenery wasted on this direction. The acting and the direction are like at a highschool performance, which problem is typical of the usual Eurotrash. The singers behave like they are at a frat party - probably they were directed to do that. The humor placed on stage is inane, and it does not really help that ""Queen Partenope"" repeatedly tries to unbotton the pants of her ""suitors"". The battle scene - which should have been a dance - was a running around the table, and playing paper-scissor-stone. That was a good indication of the whole production. It is amazing that Decca markets something like this. The singers are quite modest, most are not up to singing Handel. It is for example disturbing to hear Andreas Scholl singing his head-voice, then suddenly - and repeatedly - shifting to a [baritone] chest-voice. This was my first exposure to the Copenhagen Opera, and I will try to avoid any more exposure.

So, if you enjoy Eurotrash, buy this DVD. Otherwise, avoid it.",1259452800,29,1544,5.050980392156863
