8614551,4,B00FDW5C8U,"This film has unique footage, and is very moving. Most of the film allows the interviewees to speak for themselves (and subtitled). We visit several temples in small coastal towns profoundly impacted by the tsunami to hear from Zen priests and a pair of Pure Land (Jodo-shu) father and daughter priests. They describe the temples and religious organizations during the first few months after the disaster, and we learn that not all people responded with the same spirit. The filmmakers captured some excellent stories, and effectively spliced it with news footage. During the middle of the film, we also visit Zen temples elsewhere around Japan (notably Kasuisai during the Fire Festival) and a Zen training monastery (Daiyuzan Saijoji) to learn more about about the relationship between ancestors and Buddhism in modern Japan. Though several plot lines are given space to develop, the relationship between the disparate places the filmmaker goes is not fully explored.

When viewing the film, I wobbled between three stars and five stars. The footage is precious, and the filmmakers mostly stay out of the way. This is a strength. The people interviewed are amazing. I am grateful to have been allowed to step into that place-in-time for a few moments. There is great footage of rituals, like Zen monks fanning sutras (""tendoku"" like https://youtu.be/BBF2q0p9pdg?t=551).

However, the documentary is a little unfocused as a film. For example, considerable time is spent explicating the daily schedule of a Zen training temple, though what this has to do with the response to the 311 tsunami is not explicit. Likewise, the filmmaker's use of the term ""prayer temple"" (a translation of kito jiin) is scholarly, but passes without explanation. There are also a few times the film cuts when I wish it would linger. For example, after the Zen priest's story at 24'10"", I was rapt waiting for the implications of the scene to fully flesh out and so I fell back in my chair when there was a hard cut to black before moving on to something unrelated.

Lastly, I only noticed the problem with the narrator's voice during the opening scene. In general the narrator's voice itself seemed fine to me, but the levels weren't adjusted properly in the editing suite. I first turned the volume up a lot, and then adjusted it a few times until the other sounds were a little loud but tolerable and the filmmaker's voice was still audible. Problem solved.",1432252800,,2438,4.985257985257985
8614552,1,B00FDW5C8U,"I give this dvd one star for the following reasons.  First, the narrator's voice is almost impossible to understand, and that is a huge part of the film.  Not only is it monotone droning but has a heavy accent.  Moreover it is often drowned out by the music or other noise in the film.  In my opinion this made the film unwatchable.  Second, this has next to nothing to do about zen. In fact, one of the priests interviewed says as much, that they were just doing what seemed right to help people, and their actions weren't about zen.  Third, the narrator provides no distinction in discussing buddhism and zen.  Obviously zen is a form of buddhism but pure land buddhism is the dominant form in the country.  The narrator talks about Buddhism and zen interchangeably,, apparently having no understanding of the nuances.  I was hoping to learn about zen but learned only that this movie is terrible. Save our money and time.",1413590400,,924,4.619631901840491
8614553,3,B00FDW5C8U,"I agree with other posters here that the narrator's voice was too quiet and drowned out by the music, and some words were hard to understand.  It also seemed that parts of the story were too disconnected (i.e., one moment the story was about the tsunami, and the next it was about life in a zen monastery).  However, there was amazing footage of the disaster areas and I think the intention to tell a great cultural story was present.",1404000000,,434,4.481012658227848
8614554,3,B00FDW5C8U,"I think it's a great movie however I found myself frustrated at the thoughtful, yet hard to hear monotone of narrator.  A lot of documentaries try for the neutral narrator, but in this case it annoyed me.  I still recommend it since it's such a special subject.",1397433600,,261,4.531914893617022
8614555,4,B00FDW5C8U,"What do an ancient and gentle people do when they are hit unexpectedly by disaster?  Here we see two European film makers who were there, capture the spacious generosity of the temple people, the monastics and local priests of Buddhist traditions as they respond with what they have, and call forth a response when government was afraid to act robustly.  This film is full of kindness and compassion, of improvised caring and attempts to cope with the sudden destruction of their world.  Though it speaks of our fragility when we encounter these rare events, it gently reveals something strong and amazing about our hidden capacity when tested.  This is an event we have yet to come to terms with, to learn to cope in our understanding and in our gathering readiness for similar types of ruin in a world of climatic instability.  Here an ancient religion provides insight and guidance to possibilities we may wish to learn to access.",1396396800,2,933,4.8427672955974845
8614556,3,B00FDW5C8U,Beautiful film marred by an almost indecipherable narrator.  The English narrator needed sub titles more than any others in this film.  This is a story that needs to be told but in a way you can understand.,1386374400,2,206,4.54054054054054
