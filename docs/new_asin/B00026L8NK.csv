2063355,5,B00026L8NK,"OK, realize you're dealing with a 52 year-old guy who has been on the verge of spiritual ecstasy from the first moment he watched Invader ZIM, a guy who loves this series on about 3 different levels, what some folks would call a ""real ZIM dork"".  I have 27 episodes of ZIM (incl. the 8 unaired episodes) and have no qualms about recommending this series to ANYONE, a kid, teen or even a growed-up like me, as I never tire of watching the ridiculous events unfold in every episode, the amazing detail to the machinery that is IRKEN technology, the skillful use of parody that is present and the sly references to today's world with it's farces, foibles and ****ups!  The voice of ZIM with his speaking style is no less than genius. GIR, his borderline-functional robot is always a source of frustrating, outrageous and unpredictable behaviors that would confound the most jaded psychiatrist. You'll laugh until you bust a ""squeedley-squooch"" or worse, so immediately, right ****ing NOW, arrange to possess this wonderful series and enjoy a truly unique animation style along with great storylines.",1086480000,6,1096,4.918918918918919
2063356,5,B00026L8NK,"The second installment of the Invader Zim DVD series is here.  The adventures are crazier and the doom is stronger in this second DVD.  ""Progressive Stupidity"" is a must have for any fan Invader Zim, cartoons in general, or just plain breathing.  Like the sweet, sweet blood candies in our veins, this Invader Zim DVD is a must have item for any living organism.  You will not be disappointed by this DVD.  In fact you will be so happy that you bought this DVD that feathery soft puppies will rain from the sky and litter your front lawn with squeally joy.  You owe it to yourself to buy this DVD.  Do it for the sky puppies.",1084665600,19,625,4.336206896551724
2063357,5,B00026L8NK,"After the fantastic ""Invader ZIM Volume 1: Doom Doom Doom"", the crew is back for ""Invader ZIM Volume 2: Progressive Stupidity"".
If you don't know anything about the show, here's a short summary.
ZIM, a short alien from Planet Irk, begs for a second chance after destroying his home planet during a past invasion. Now, with a second war coming, ZIM is sent to Earth with an idiotic robot, GIR. A young alien hunter named Dib and his gothic sister Gaz both know about ZIM's plans and [Dib] tries to stop him. (But neither side is taken seriously by the planet).
Created by Jhonen Vasquez. This DVD contains episodes 10-18 of the short lived series. 5 OUT OF 5.",1084579200,6,658,4.53781512605042

2063528,5,B00026L8NK,"Get ready for the most comically inept evil alien invader ever. Zim and his hilarious robot companion Grr are two of the absolute funniest and most original animated characters to grace our lowly Earthling TVs in ages. If you aren't familiar with creator, Jhonen Vasquez from his twisted and subversively hilarious comics, you can get a good sense of the way he views society through Zim's eyes. Something as dreary as a grade school hamster mascot can be turned into a plot to overthrow humanity by exploiting our general ignorance and love of all things cute and fuzzy. Babies can plot world domination because no adult would ever suspect them. Tacos can be the difference between robot destruction and robot distraction. This show will be fun for kids, but I always got the feeling that it was slightly more geared towards adults much the way Ren & Stimpy was.  If you like your animation with a little edge to it, give in to your new Irkin overlord...ZIM!!!",1410393600,,961,4.754491017964072

2063566,5,B00026L8NK,"Overall, I would say Invader Zim is the #1 best show ever, and there's not too much else to say about that. :D

The used DVD I got from ExpressMedia arrived very quickly! (only two days) The discs are in great condition, and work perfectly!

I would definitely recommend that you get this show. There are rumors going around that IZ (Invader Zim) may go back into production, and if so, the original DVDs will probably skyrocket in price.

(For those of you who have never watched Invader Zim, why the hell are you on this page? Why search it if you've never seen it?) However, this review is coming from a 14 year old super-fan, so rent it first. Rent it- and love it! This show is the only reason I watch Nicktoons anymore. If you've ever read any of Jhonen Vasquez's other works like me (i.e. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Squee!, FillerBunny, I Feel Sick), then I guarantee you will love this show. It's full of dark/adultish humor. So get this disc! Do it for the children, for tacos, for giant radioactive rubber pants!",1313798400,,732,4.470149253731344

2063596,5,B00026L8NK,"This Invader Zim set is wonderul and has no bad parts to it. If you love Invader Zim or whacky cartoons in general, I suggest you pick this up. This set contains episodes 10-18.

Invader Zim is a dark, disturbing cartoon that looks like someone made it that was insane (but in a good way). The basis of the story is that an alien, Zim, from planet Irk is sent to a mysterious planet on what he thinks is a mission to conquer it. His leaders, The Almighty Tallest, only sent him away to be rid of him for a while. Zim and his robot servant, GIR, just so happen to land on Earth. Sadly, Zim is unequipped to handle the challenges that await him on Earth. To make matters worse for Zim, a child with a huge head named Dib sets out to stop Zim at all costs.

The extras include some wonderful commentary on the episodes by a number of different people involved in the show's production. It's well worth watch through again with the commentary on.",1214870400,,942,4.256983240223463

2063598,4,B00026L8NK,"Another twisted and amusing series filled with curious and bizarre characters along with impulsive events that take place in each episode.  Zim is still the erratic, sceptical fool as he was in Volume One, and yet his eager ambition to annihilate our piteous little plant called Earth is stronger then ever! The episodes still manages to uphold the same Humour, Style and Uniqueness as Volume One: DOOM DOOM DOOM, with each episode holding its own random and exuberant plots.",1199318400,,475,5.012658227848101

1.)  does your baby not age?

2.)  does your baby not talk after 7 years of life?

2063624,5,B00026L8NK,"Invader Zim has been sent from the planet Irken to take over the world ... he believes.  In reality, the Tall Ones, leaders of Irken, sent him away to get rid of him.  Together with his patched-together robot Gir, Zim takes his job very seriously.  He disguises himself as an earth child with a skin condition (green) and attends the local school.  Only Dib, the crazy kid at school, suspects him of being an alien.

The humor in Invader Zim is advanced for Nickelodeon, where the cartoon originated.  Body functions and toilet humor abound, along with some great one-liners. Pure cartoon entertainment, especially for fans of Jhonen Vasquez's humor.

Here is a quick rundown of the episodes:

DISC ONE:

1) Plague Of Babies - Zim's secret identity is threatened by a race of aliens that look like human babies.  Gir plays with the 'stupid ray'.

2) Bloaty's Pizza Hog - Gaz wants to go to Bloaty's Pizza Hog for dinner with Dad, but has to rescue Dib from Zim first.

3) Door To Door - The school uses Poop-Dog to entice the kids to sell Poop-bars door-to-door.  Zim resorts to Irken techniques to sell the most.

4) FBI Warning Of Doom - Gir rents the movie ""Intestines Of War"", and Zim has to face the psycho mall security guy to return it after hours.

5) Bolognuis Maximus - Dib finds out bologna burns Zim.  Zim retaliates by injecting, via a tack on his chair, bologna DNA into Dib that makes him delicious, stinky, and irresistible to dogs.

6) Game Slave 2 - Gaz needs the new Game Slave 2 to play her Vampire Piggy Hunter game, but has to chase Iggums to get it.

7) Battle Of The Planets - The Tall Ones plan Operation Doom II on the planet Blorch.  Zim finds out that Mars is a giant spaceship, but Dib finds out Mercury is one too.

8) Halloween Spectacular Of Spooky Doom - Dib is taken to an asylum on Halloween because he keeps fading in and out of a monster dimension.  The monster dimension is pretty cool.

DISC TWO:

1) Mysterious Mysteries.  Desperate for a new show, the producer of Mysterious Mysteries uses one of Dib's tapes to prove there are aliens; mainly Zim and Gir.

2) Future Dib - Dib's dad, Professor Membrane, invents the Perpetual Energy Generator (PEG).  Zim creates a remote-controlled Dib robot to destroy PEG.

3) Hobo 13 - The Tall Ones send Zim to the planet Hobo 13 to evaluate him as a warrior.  He makes himself team leader and sacrifices them one by one to win.

4) Walk For You Lives - Its Probing Day on Irken, but in order for Zim to pass inspection he must get rid of a slowly exploding piece of matter.

5) Megadoomer - A disgruntled packager on Irken sends the Megadoomer to Invader Zim instead of the load of malfunctioning SIR units.  But the Megadoomer didn't come with batteries.

6) Lice - There is lice outbreak at Zim's school.  Zim is the only student who doesn't get lice.  The Delousers quarentine the school looking for the lice queen.

7) Abducted - Insect-like aliens abduct Zim and Gir to add to their collection, but they're not very bright and haven't succeeded in collecting any specimens yet.

8) The Sad Sad Tale Of Chickenfoot - Dib sets after the news crews of Mysterious Mysteries to prove that Chickenfoot is just a guy in a suit named Chewy Rodriguez.

Extras:  Most episodes have commentaries available, some have animatics, there are a few interviews, and you can turn on Irken subtitles.

Make sure you pick up Volume One: Doom Doom Doom before diving into this volume.  I thought the first season was a little grosser and a little funnier, this second season seems like Nickelodeon toned the humor down a bit.

There are still no English subtitles.  The only subtitles are Irken, which are just scribbles.  Also, the discs are labeled three and four, rather than one and two, continuing from Volume One, which has discs one and two.  Get ready to continue laughing, Zim hasn't lost his touch yet!  Enjoy!",1152748800,6,3884,4.5491329479768785

2063626,5,B00026L8NK,"I just love the way this series pokes fun at skool. The mispellings, the drool, the loathsome subjects. The series was aimed at teenagers and unfortunately flopped on Nickolodean. But thank goodness we have these DVD's. Buy them all and watch them or you are Dooooooomed and I'll have to sing the doom song to you! doom, doom, doom... <repeat tonelessly>",1136332800,3,354,4.819672131147541
2063627,5,B00026L8NK,"When I heard that Volume 2 of the ZIM series had came out, I reacted almost immidatly. I ordered it from here, and waited impatiently for it to come. When I got home from a particularly rough day of ""skool"" (sorry), I found a package on my front steps. I didn't even bother to open my front door when I picked it up. I ripped it open, and found this DVD. Let's just say I didn't do my homework that night. I was amazed of the improvement from Volume 1! The episodes were wittier, the characters were less odd-looking animation-wise, and the commentaries were so much funnier! Here are my reviews for all the episodes:

1a: Plague of Babies: 3/5 I don't like this one very  much. It just doesn't appeal to me.

1b: Bloaties Pizza Hog: 4/5 The reason this one is so funny is the way it rips apart places Chuck E Cheese's.

2a: Door to Door: 4.9/5 I love this one! The only flaw is the lazers at the beginning. I didn't think those were funny.

2b: FBI Warning of Doom: 4/5 This one's okay. It's not my favorite but I love the names of the stores (Video Outhouse, House of Lard), and the zombies.

3a: Bolognius Maximus: 5/5 This one is just plain sickening. I love it.

3b: Game Slave 2: 4.5/5 The only bad thing is that Iggins comes back to life at the end of the episode.

4: Battle of the Planets: 5/5 The second half-hour episode, and in my opinion, the third best in the Second Volume.

5: Halloween Spectacular of Spooky Doom: 5/5 Second best in this volume.

6a: Mysterious Mysteries: 4.5/5 The re-enactors MAKE the episode!

6b: Future Dib: 4/5 Overall a good episode, but the monkey is the best.

7a: HOBO 13: 3.5/5 Not that great, except that Skoodge appears again.

7b: Walk For Your Lives: 4.5/5 I loved the ""Morbidly Obese Baby Dolls"" truck!

8a: MegaDoomer: 5/5 GIR is the best in this episode!

8b: Lice: 4/5 It's okay.

9a: Abducted: 5/5 HILARIOUS!

9b: The Sad, Sad Tale of Chickenfoot: 6/5 One of my all time favorites, and the best on the volume!

So, I hope this helps you realize the greatness that is ZIM, and you will order it right now!",1134172800,,2058,4.328981723237598

Why oh why they haven't put it on terrestrial here in the UK is just plain wrong. Put pressure on Channel 4 if, like me, you agree that this deserves a much much wider UK audience.

This DVD really brings out all the greatness in all the other characters with episodes staring Dib Gaz and yes even Scooge! What makes this volume so great? The characters get nuttier the episodes get weirder and most importantly 'Hobo 13' is the greatest episode ever! I don't know what Nickelodeon was thinking. The highlights in this dvd inicluce...'Plague of Babies', 'Bloaties Pizza Hog' 'Hobo 13' 'Game Slave II' and of course 'Lice' because it kept me up all night it was so creepy.

2063644,5,B00026L8NK,"Here we are once again, the second of the most highly anticipated DVD sets for Invader Zim! With one more DVD set to go, IZ fanatics can finally own this wonderful series without Nickelodeon's annoying bumpers and commercials.

New to the realm of Invader Zim (or having a memory lapse)? Here's a quick recap: After accepting a ""secret mission"" by the Almighty Tallests, our power-hungry invader named Zim has made himself comfy on Earth along with his robot assistant named Gir. While having to deal with the horrors of Skool and constantly trying to keep Dib out of his hairs, Zim still has a long way to go before successfully conquring Earth.

Im my opinon, Volume Two is the true gem of the short-lived series. Most of my favorite episodes are on this DVD set including:

*Pleague of Babies: Zim believes that a wee human baby will leak out his existence on Earth, but he gets more than he bargained for after discovering the baby's true identity.

*Door to Door: Miss Bitters' class is having a school fundraiser and Zim wants to find out what Poop Dog's ""mystery grand prize"" is.

*Game Slave 2: A new Game Slave has come out and Gaz will stop at nothing to get her hands on it.

If you haven't seen IZ, then get your butt down to store and pick this and Volume 1 up right now! If you are the type of person who wants to see animation that is hip and cool, IZ is diffently your cup of tea. With cinimatic-like scopes, score and action, this series is unlike anything else before it! Vasquez takes the ordinary and transforms it into the extraordinary with crazy characters, color environments and sharp writting that you have to experience again and again!",1097712000,2,1663,4.563758389261745
2063645,5,B00026L8NK,"This set was just as good as the first, if not better! The commentary tracks were hilarious in parts and also provided insight on influences for some episodes. The quality was once again excellent and the ""Nick"" logo was again absent from the corner. Both the sound and animation were cleaner than they ever seemed when the episodes were aired. An unaired version of a scene in ""Door to Door"" is included. Simply said, if you liked the first set, you may like this one even more! I highly recommend it for any Zim fan.",1097712000,,518,4.463157894736842
2063656,4,B00026L8NK,"It's still good stuff.  If I am correct, this encapsulates the second season of Jhonen Vasquez's ""Invader ZIM.""  As the story goes, Nickelodeon was so horrified at the first season that they were dead set on killing ZIM once and for all.  HOWEVER.  When Invader ZIM's fanbase heard about the cancellation, they nearly went as mad as Gir on a sugar high.  Letters poured into Nickelodeon demanding at least one more season of ""ZIM.""  And they, strange but true, kept it alive for one more season because of their complaints.

It is obvious that in creating the second season Jhonen didn't give much thought to caution.  He knew his show was going to be axed, and soon.  So therefore, he had nothing to worry about, really.  Thus the immaturity factor goes way up here and the jokes are, yes, gross.  However, there are certain episodes here, like ""Game Slave 2"" and ""Door to Door"" that please me in their ability to parody some of the wretchedness of low culture.  Some of the other episodes, though, rival and even overpower South Park in their gross out factor.  Yuck.  Ah, well, Jhonen is cool.",1097366400,2,1096,4.640625
2063657,5,B00026L8NK,"I joined the ZIM fanbase after it's cancel from Nickelodeon. I think I saw one episode before it went off. Then, I just randomly started watching it on Nicktoons. After another episode, I fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. I preordered this DVD in June, when I knew it didn't come out until August. It is just that good! What's better than Battle of the Planets and Walk For Your Lives? I mean, just hearing the Tallest say ""It's Probing Day!"" is enough to make my day better. (Yay! Two words! More Puppets!!!) It doesn't have many extras, but is quite fun to watch the interviews with the writers. (on the first DVD, if you watch the interview with the voice actors, when you see Jhonen's puppet, you can see part of his head hiding behind a chair, lol)Also, the commentary is the most awesome. Sometimes I just turn it on and do something else so I can hear the commentary.  So buy it! NOW. Or I shall send my plague of babies to drool on you.",1097280000,2,947,4.320224719101123
2063658,5,B00026L8NK,"It won't take long for ""Invader Zim"" to take its rightful place next to ""Ren & Stimpy"" and ""Rocko's Modern Life"" as brilliant cartoons Nickelodeon tried to get rid of (though some might argue it already has). Let's face it: Nickelodeon, like MTV, started off with great ideas, new, daring shows, and a widespread demographic. Now, with the Klasky-Csupo machine churning out Rugrats spinoffs and ""Rocket Power"" movies, there's not much room for new ideas. ""Invader Zim"" came and went, but not before its small but devout fanbase forced Nickelodeon to keep the project alive, at least for a few more episodes.

You want more proof this show was great? At the time of this writing, all three volumes of Zim DVDs (the third one's on preorder) are on the Top 100 Sellers list.

But, enough about the show in general. What makes Vol. 2 of this collection worth buying? Well, even if this came as a barebones DVD, I still would've bought it, just for the episodes, my personal favorite being the half-hour ""Battle of the Planets."" The storyline is great, the special effects are great, and the instruction manual alien (""Hey, pilot! How ya doin'?"") is great.

Then, you have the Tim Burton-esque ""Halloween Spectacular of Spooky Doom,"" which is equal parts funny, scary and just plain cool.

As for the other episodes, you got ""Game Slave 2"" which is all about Gaz and also makes an interesting commentary about video games. There's also more of The Tallest in Volume 2 than in Volume 1 (The Tallest are my fav characters, second only to GiR). They make appearances in ""Hobo 13,"" ""Megadoomer,"" ""Walk for Your Lives"" (It's probing day!), and ""Battle of the Planets.""

There's commentary on every episode, animatics and storyboards for every episode...MAN, this DVD rocks! Bottom line is if you're looking for exciting, original animation, you really oughta look into owning ""Invader Zim""!",1096416000,6,1880,4.89937106918239
2063659,5,B00026L8NK,"i love this show so much. i can't wait until the third one comes out on october 12th. it will be so nice. but for right now i get to watch the first 4 dvds.

extras are very limited with only interviews with the strange strange creators of the series excluding jhonen vasquez. he is quite the elusive one isn't he? the 16 episodes are all great in their own little ways, but i would have to say my favorites are 'battle of the planets', were zim goes to mars and unintentionally turns the world into a giant space ship after analyzing the face and dib turns mercury into another space ship after analizing the butt on the dark side.and 'walk for your lives' where an explosion zim created is slowed down along with dib with a variable time status field. 'abducted' is also pretty good too where zim gets abducted by aliens who are so dumb they think he is human and they fuse creatures together using duct tape.

fans of zim know they want this product, they need it, invading their veins like radioactive rubber pants, obey the veins. i hope they come out with a video game to this show. it would be easy enough for them considering some of the episodes are video games.",1094428800,,1171,4.36697247706422

Anything Zim is better than anything not Zim, so this DVD definately belongs in your collection.

I felt that some of the episodes were kinda weak, like ""Door to door"", which seems to have no real focus and just floats along. And we probably could have gone without Chickenfoot, altho it does shed light into Dib's world, more than we saw in previous epsiodes (Career day).

I imagine I can feel a little pressure on the producers during these episodes. The show was threatened with DOOM, and the I suspect the producers were trying to ""toe the line"". But you can't hide the fact that this is just not standard Nick fare. Down with Klasky/Csupo!

I personally feel that no epsiode can top ""Dark Harvest"" on the first DVD. But since a third DVD set is due, and I've not seen it, that remains to be seen.",1094256000,2,932,4.432748538011696

Yes, the series is set in a grade school and does feature young characters, but Jhonen and his writers revel in the grotesque and macabre. Invader Zim belongs on Nickelodeon like CSI belongs on PAX.

As such, I technically owned this edition a month before it's release, but as it's release was yesterday, I'm still waiting for amazon to send it.
Volume two of Zim contains some of my favorite episodes. Most notably, the two part ""Battle of the Planets."" If you've never seen Zim, I reccomend that you rent this edition and watch that, if nothing else. Unfortunately, if also contains my least favorite episode, ""Bolognius Maximus"" in which Zim is slowly turning into a Bologne sausage. That is the only episode of Zim I've ever only liked instead of loved. Still, BM is only 15 minutes of a 4 1/2 hour laugh riot, so I figure that I shouldn't bother to dock Zim points for that misconduct. After all, it wouldn't be complete without it.
Anyway, if you've ever seen or read anything by Jhonen Vasquez, what are you waiting for? BUY THIS F*CKING DVD!!! Also, Zim V1, JTHM collection, and Squee's wonderful big giant book of unspeakable horrors are great buys. If you haven't seen Zim and are considering giving it a try, give it a rental first. There is no middle ground in Zim. You love it or you hate it, so make sure it's right for you before you spend too much cash. Hope I've been a help.",1094083200,3,1506,4.306338028169014
2063664,5,B00026L8NK,"Invader Zim has to be one of my most favorite cartoons, and there are few out there I enjoy at all. Jhonen Vasquez, known to me as the creator of the infamous ""Johnny the Hommicidal Maniac"" comic books, brings his twist of insane humor to this fun and hilarious cartoon series.

First, a summary of the series. A technologically advanced races of aliens, the Irken Empire, is devoted to conquering all of known space. To aid them in this task, they select a group of elite Irken soldiers, known as Invaders, to scout ahead the selected-for-conquest planets and eradicate all resistance. They are the top, the best, the most brilliant (and tallest); none of these could describe Invader Zim. He's a discrace, responsible for the failure of Operation: Impending Doom 1, nearly destroying his whole race, but despite all this he believes himself to be mighty, brilliant and a force to be reckoned with. To keep him from screwing up Operation: Impeding Doom 2, his leaders (the Almighty Tallest) send him to a ""mystery planet"" to keep him out of the way. Unfortunately for us, they end up picking Earth. Zim lands and begins his infiltration of the ignorant human population, disguising himself as a normal green Earth boy with a skin condition. Only Dib, a classmate and paranormal investigator, sees through his simple disguise and swears to expose Zim. Dib is not the hero of the series of course, he's just as much a screw-up as Zim.

Volume 2 of this series has some of the best episodes of the series before its unfortunate cancelation. ""Battle of the Planets"" reveals more details of the Irken race, the progress of Operation: Impending Doom 2, and that Dib is not alone in his pursuit of Zim and the paranormal. ""Megadoomer"" is hilarious, involving Zim trying to destroy Dib with a battle-mech with a faulty cloaking device (the robot turns invisible but the pilot, Zim, does not). ""Game Slave 2"" focuses on Dib's sister Gaz, and showcases her creepy-little-goth-girl powers. ""Bolognius Maximus"" is a great parody of ""The Fly"" (of which Vasquez is a huge fan), only instead of an insect, Dib discovers Zim is trying to turn him into bologna. This collection also includes ""Halloween Spectacular of Spooky Doom"", ""Walk For Your Lives"", and ""Lice"" among others.

The special features are just as worth this purchase as the episodes themselves. There is much more commentary (some episodes have two commentary tracks), which is just as hilarious as the previous volume's. Roman Dirge, creator of the ""Lenore"" comic books and story writer for Invader Zim, pops in for a few episode commentaries, as does Kevin Manthei, who composed most of the great soundtrack for the show.

If you liked volume 1, pick this up immediately. If you're unfamiliar with Invader Zim I would reccommend watching this one first, as the episodes here are better than most of those on volume 1.",1093651200,9,2870,4.862985685071575
2063675,5,B00026L8NK,"This DVD set is brilliant. Aside from the sheer brilliance that is Invader Zim, there are insightful (once they calm down--though their insanity is delicious like Dib's dna altered skin) cast/crew commentaries, wonderful interviews with the writers this time around, and an extra set of music commentaries on three of the episodes! The best commentaries by far are the ones with Jhonen and Rikki Simons together. Rikki is brilliant ^_^. My personal favorite episodes on this DVD, being a huge Gaz fan, are Bloaty's Pizza Hog and Game Slave 2. I was rather dissapointed to find, like on the first set of DVDs, that Melissa Fahn was again absent from the commentary reel despite being noted on the back as participating, a mere oversight I'm sure. The writer interviews are fantastic and Roman Dirge and Danielle Koenig are brilliant (as are all the writers!) I hope they do a whole interview with Jhonen for the third and final set of dvds!!",1093564800,2,940,4.84472049689441
2063676,5,B00026L8NK,"I have been a lover of Zim since the show first aired and, like so many others, was sad to see it go.  I have the first dvd and am waiting patiently for my new one to arrive.  I have even gotten my children hooked on our screaming green friend.  It is because of them that I made a fantastic discovery.  ZIM STILL LIVES!!!!!!!!!!  The show is still on the air.  If you are fortunate enough to have digital cable, Zim can be seen on the Ntoons channel.  Its a channel that shows only nicktoons all the time, including shows that can no longerbe seen on the regular channel.  No new episodes, unfortunately, but for those who wanna check it out, its there.",1093046400,3,654,4.260162601626016
2063677,5,B00026L8NK,"Ah, Invader ZIM. It's grown quite a large fanbase, and it was only a matter of time before it came on DVD. And now it is. It is a bit of a letdown, because the original cover for this set, drawn by Jhonen, was much cooler, but Nick vetoed it. So now we're stuck with this generic stock art. Anyway, this is Volume Two of the set of three, and it's got some gems on it. Since the episodes aired out of order, here's what's on this two disc set:

Plague of Babies / Bloaty's Pizza Hog*

Door to Door / FBI Warning of Doom*

Bolognius Maximus / Game Slave 2

Battle of the Planets

Halloween Spectacular of Spooky Doom

Mysterious Mysteries* / Future Dib

Hobo 13 / Walk for your Lives

Megadoomer / Lice

Abducted / The Sad, Sad Tale of Chickenfoot

(episodes with an asterisk do not have commentary)

Abducted, possibly my favorite episode, is here, where ZIM and GIR get abducted by two idiotic aliens who think he's a human. Also very great episodes are Megadoomer, Game Slave 2, and Walk for your Lives, which I believe never aired here in the US. But, we'll have plenty to see when the unaired episodes release on volume 3.

Well, all in all, if you love ZIM, you can't afford to miss this set. Even if you don't, it's worth checking out. This is a frighteningly original and hilarious and beautiful series, that definitely should have ran longer.",1092960000,19,1350,4.377510040160643

2063680,5,B00026L8NK,"Seeing as how quite a few of the online reviews for this particular DVD are quite hard to read, I shall provide you with brilliant (and metaphorical) insight to the wonder that is Zim.

 I remember seeing the commercials for Zim on Nickelodeon and thinking that this is something worth seeing. Sadly, I didn't get around to watching it until Nanozim came out, and I was officially hooked.

 I can sum up the wonder of this series in one word: screaming.

 All of the voice actors and actresses in this show scream at the top of their lungs. And it's a proven fact that the public likes screaming.

 With brilliant colors and quirky animation, this show is sure to keep the interest of people with the shortest attention spans. Being one of those people, I can vouch for that.

 The reason I'm excited about this particular set...

 Well, actually, there are several reasons:

 1) Commentary on most of my favorite episodes. Please do not miss out on this! I never laughed so hard in my life. Jhonen has to be one of the funniest and most charming cartoonists on Earth right now. Please... please hit that button on your remote and listen to the freakin' commentary.

 2) This brings us closer to the unaired episodes!

 I've had the privilege of seeing a few of the unaired eps and I have to say, the writing is wittier, the colors are brighter, and the acting is doomier and squishier. (Those are positive adjectives, by the way).

 3) High quality versions of the all the episodes that were so horribly broadcasted on cable television.

 4) Extras! Extras! And more extras!

 5) At such a cheap price, it feels like I'm stealing it.

 I also believe that the second volume of this series starts with Plague of Babies and goes on through until it stops at walk For Your Lives. This pleases me greatly, as some of the best episodes were towards the end of the first season.

 That's all I have to say about this DVD.

 The volume practically sells itself.

 And it wins a box of adhesive medical strips.",1090713600,113,2003,4.523809523809524
2063681,5,B00026L8NK,ok so i got a lttle bit more throught the internet and so the guide lines for the season 2 dvd ive seen all the eps and honestly invader zim rocks like a pile of monkeys yes a pile of monkeys. cause all zim is thinking about is taking over the world. and i can't wait to see tak and heer cat robot,1088380800,3,297,3.7301587301587302
2063682,5,B00026L8NK,ZIM has to be the best show that was ever aired.  The humor is witty and clever and stuff;  the animation is great (even if the characters are easy to draw) It's great...,1087516800,5,170,4.121212121212121
2063683,5,B00026L8NK,"I was not able to catch all the episodes when they aired on NICK, but those i did see were very funny (to adults and kids alike). If you cannot wait for this release you can catch the repeats on nicktoons (channel 178 on dishnetwork). I just found out this channel existed! It airs SAT, SUN and TUES (i think), (i found it by using the search button on the remote) but the listing description does not tell you episode info, so i don't know if all these are the same program. I plan to buy all the dvds, but wonder if there will be a complete box set? That would make any ZIM fan insanely happy.",1087344000,8,595,4.094017094017094
8022742,5,B00026L8NK,Great commentaries. Spanish language track is poor audio quality though I'm unsure if this is because of the DVD or the dub itself.,1518134400,,131,4.739130434782608
8022743,5,B00026L8NK,"Invader Zim is a world with no heroes.  Our titular protagonist, Zim, although maniacally amusing to watch, is no hero by any standard definition of the word.  Our secondary protagonist (and it could be argued, equally important protagonist), Dib, has many more readily identifiable heroic traits, such as bravery and admirable - nay, neurotic - perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds.  However, it is shown that the world and people he is trying to protect are stupid at best, cruel and vindictive at worst, and the crumbling society that they inhabit devoid of beauty or meaning.  Dib struggles alone, clinging to his principles and his precious truth in the face of a populous that has no need for him, and places no value in him.  Indeed, his actions in the face of this reality feel increasingly more futile and meaningless despite their inherent nobility.  Likewise, Zims people are equally without merit - led mindlessly by leaders who are themselves mindless and hedonistic, inhabiting a world that is possibly even more shallow and ignorant than Earths society.  Even poor Zim is pitiable in his delusional desire to please his leaders, who care nothing for him.

Whichever protagonist we as an audience are meant to identify with is rendered an ultimately moot point, as we cannot truly be satisfied with the victory of either party due to the overall, none-too-subtle, undercurrent of nihilism present in the bleak world Jhonen Vasquez has painted for us.  No matter which party succeeds in their goal, there is no salvation here  only the disappointing feeling of futility and despair.  So what is left for we as the viewers to root for?  What value are we to glean from any of this?  Nothing.  We are only left with inscrutable madness and the hilarious absurdity of it all.  So let us laugh  a great swelling of laughter to fill the immeasurable void  for there is nothing else left.

TL:DR version:  Invader Zim is a fun show about a little green alien with a cute robot dog who try to take over the Earth while a big-headed human boy tries to stop him.  Watch it  its funny!",1509840000,,2097,4.7855153203342615
