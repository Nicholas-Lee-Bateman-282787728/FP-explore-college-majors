Showtime and The Movie Channel owned Paramount pictures rights to exclusively show their movies through their network at one point. Between HBO and Cinemax, there was competitive struggle for more Subscribers to get lured I'm sure. Blue City had a reuniting chemistry with Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy since the Breakfast Club. And it was potential possibilities to boost David Caruso's career after supportive role as his character of Sheedy's Brother. And always a treat to view Paul Winfield's performance of any role he's set to play. May he Rest in peace. I viewed this film when VHS and Blockbuster Video was in full popularized effect Back then.",1523145600,,752,4.837209302325581
8731262,3,B014L2Y1TS,"Not a great movie by any stretch of criticism, but I enjoy discovering under-seen 80s flicks regardless of quality so I sought this one out after checking out the trailer online. The editing is wonky in places, character motivations and reactions seem out of place with reality, but I dig the actors and the time and setting. It was interesting to catch some well known actors in some early work that is often forgotten. Some people will and do hate this movie but I don't regret having seen it for the 80s nostalgia and to be able to analyze it from a ""what went wrong"" perspective.",1473379200,,583,4.509433962264151
