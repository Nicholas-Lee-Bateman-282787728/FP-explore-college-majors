8084774,3,B000BBOUMM,"The DVD did not skip as much as Volumes 5 and 6,but at least I got to enjoy it. I will now buy new DVD's.",1378771200,,105,3.24
8084775,5,B000BBOUMM,"The Suzuka series is an enjoyable anime that contains love, laughter and some pain. I found myself attached to the entire series and love how the series ended. Some of the episodes seemed to repeat themselves and I did find myself hoping the love triangle would end and Suzuka would clean up her attitude. I would recommend this anime to those who enjoyed School Rumble, Chobits or Clannad.",1367625600,,390,4.75
8084776,5,B000BBOUMM,"Yamato moves in with his Aunt, who runs an apartment complex and bath house for women.

Suzuka is a hard sell with a damaged heart, and Yamato is going to have to get the gold to impress her.

This is one of the best romance animes I've seen. It's a very touching and emotionally heavy story. There are lots of great characters and plot twists. The thing that makes this anime great for me is the character development. You really get a great understanding of the characters and why they think the way do. There is nothing about this anime that isn't fantastic. I think anyone can get a lot of enjoyment out of it. It's a great buy.",1354924800,,815,4.3618421052631575
8084777,4,B000BBOUMM,"In 2075, man dwells in space as well as on the Earth. Space debris has become a dangerous reality. Ai Tanabe is a young lady who has come to space to collect and dispose of this dangerous debris. She meets veteran debris collector, Hoshino. Together with their friends, they keep space travelers and residents safe. As time goes by, the 2 fall in love with each other. It's harder to do a dangerous job with the one you love waiting and praying for your safety.

This anime is really good. It has action, drama, comedy, Sci-fi/adventure, and a bit of romance. It's pretty stacked. The animation and voice actors are good as well. I'm really surprised that this anime isn't more well known. The 1 thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the depth of the story. The story backgrounds the characters well, but there is a little too much wasted time on goofiness I think. If that time were used to develop the romance between Ai and Hoshino more, This series could have been incredible. This series does have a very satisfying ending though. Overall, this anime is a joy to watch. I highly recommend it to anime fans of any genre.",1354406400,2,1140,4.480769230769231
8084778,4,B000BBOUMM,"In the fact that Japan as a whole in utterly xenophobic and it shows in the stories they make. Great settings all the time, but usually anti-foreign (i.e. Anti-American most All the time). Still stuns me to this day that the movie called 'Vexille' was made since it was so much more against the folly of the Japanese rather then foreign involvement.

Also, by this time. Most artists where starting to catch the ""green bug"" in as to write, they all became tree huggers. The company called 'Gonzo' has done several shows about rouge foliage rampaging against us evil human beings who Reap mother Gaia.

'Planetes' is a solid science fiction story infested with thick layers of rotten preachy ideas that pollutes the overall thrust of the show. It's high time scientists develop a edit feature to mute out those moments in Every show I've watched so I can enjoy a great show completely.",1255651200,,884,4.733766233766234
8084779,5,B000BBOUMM,"This fourth volume of Planetes continues the solid job of story-telling and animation.  As with earlier volumes, there are some similarities to the terrific original manga, but also some unique features to the anime.  This volume covers the changing relationship between Hachimaki & Tanabe, and introduces the Jupiter expedition and Hachi's father.

A particular strength is the ongoing development of the minor characters.  Several supporting players receive some good character development, sometimes in the foreground and sometimes in the background, adding to the richness of the story.  The writing and directing uses a broader range of character development than the manga, and also uses a variety of comic, dramatic and suspenseful storytelling and pacing to sustain and build the long overall narrative.  The animation features some nice grace notes supporting the character development.

While the single DVD in this package has fewer extras than some of the earlier two-disk sets, there is still a nice group of features, including an audio drama, a brief documentary from NASA and a deconstruction of the opening credits, with scenes from the history of space flight.  This series continues to impress and is becoming one of my favorites.  The respect that the creators give to both the material and the aidience is notable.",1136160000,7,1335,5.349282296650718
