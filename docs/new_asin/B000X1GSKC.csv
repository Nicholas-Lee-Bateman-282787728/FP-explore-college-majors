8226456,4,B000X1GSKC,"It seems that the Ruth Rendell mysteries come out in different formats. I have set 3, volume 2, which contains two stories. It is by Acorn Media. One is Harm Done with Detective Wexford. The other is The Fallen Curtain. This set is appearently not on sale by amazon, but people can get the films in another collection. For example, this one joins Harm Done with Lake of Darkness.

Rendell is a very good writer and the films of her stories are good, although, of course, the books themselves, which contain much more information, are much better. She writes two kinds of stories, One is a police procedural staring Inspector Wexford. The others are straight psychological tales. However, even the detective stories have psychological underpinnings. In Harm Done, for example, Rendell explores three different kinds of sexual perversions and the effects thay have on people. In addition, she examines Detective Wexford who has become angry, broods, chastizes people, and makes mistakes. In fact, he is arguably the cause of a person's death.",1320019200,2,1040,5.046511627906977
