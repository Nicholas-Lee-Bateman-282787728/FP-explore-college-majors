8250178,2,B0013D8LGI,"This feature contains two movies: Loverboy and Lucky 7
Loverboy is presented fine in the correct aspect ratio with subs so thumbs up.
Unfortunately when it comes to Lucky 7 Sony has joined the ""must fit a widescreen"" mindset.  The film was shot for TV not theatre in the days when TVs were 4:3 aspect ratio.  To make it ""fit"" a widescreen TV Sony has cropped the top and bottom of the picture. This has resulted in lots of scenes with characters talking with part of their head out of the picture.  Urgh,,,,,, The Queen of Hearts would love it though.",1480550400,2,551,4.435643564356436
