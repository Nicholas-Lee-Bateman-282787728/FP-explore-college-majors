3414885,4,B0018BZDRU,"""Heavy Metal in Baghad"" is the story of Acrassicauda (Black Scorpion), the only heavy metal band in Iraq. In Baghdad, the band struggles to practice and perform despite obstacles set up by both the Americans and terrorists. Eventually, the situation at home gets bad enough to force an exodus to Syria. There, the band reunites, plays a live show and records a demo. (The three demo songs can be heard on the band's myspace page.)  The film is a personalized and unique look at life in post-invasion Iraq. While the heavy metal scene is counter culture in the West, it can be a literal death wish in the Middle East. Where the band members live, they are unable to play their music or grow long hair. At the same time they are denied visas to emigrate to the West. While about a heavy metal band, an interest in metal is not a prerequisite for an appreciation of this film. (For the curious, they sound similar to Iron Maiden.)

3414886,5,B0018BZDRU,This movie is great; a completely different perspective on the consequences of everything going on in Baghdad and the effect it's having on musicians. Will watch again.,1214179200,,168,5.2592592592592595
3414887,5,B0018BZDRU,"Let me start by disclosing that I know one of the directors.  In fact, that's how I found out about this documentary, and I watched it because I was curious to see what he came up with.  Suroosh, job well done!

To be clear, this documentary is only superficially about heavy metal or the struggles of a band trying to make it.  It's really about the everyday consequences that Iraqi citizens face as a result of American occupation of their country (by the way, where are those WMDs again?).  More personally and generally, it's about the struggles young adults face when they're caught between cultures and when their aspirations are constantly undermined by forces over which they have essentially no influence.

This is all illustrated by focusing on a group of young Iraqi men who happen to acquire a love for heavy metal, so they become musicians and try to get a viable band going in Iraq.  Their affinity to heavy metal gives them a tie to American culture, but they still see themselves as fundamentally Iraqi, so they surely experience ambivalance about their cultural identity.  And as their story unfolds, we find that, like a combination of Sisyphus and Tantalus, they're compelled to perpetually struggle to see their dream come to fruition, but chaotic and dangerous social, economic, and political circumstances always seem to conspire to keep it out of reach.

Yet, despite all this adversity, they maintain a sense of hope, and we're inspired by it.  In this, we see another way that they reflect a characteristically American attitude.  But at the very end of the documentary, their bitterness about American occupation and the devastation it has wreaked for their country comes out, with their despair becoming painfully palpable.  The hope we shared with them is thus dashed, and the documentary ends on this depressing but real note.

Like I said, can you handle the truth?  If so, or if you want to try (and have an open mind and at least a sliver of empathy), this documentary offers a uniquely useful window into the true consequences of war and oppression in the everyday lives of ordinary people.",1258848000,,2123,4.861111111111111
3414888,3,B0018BZDRU,"OK, this isn't the best-done ""documentary"" I've ever seen but it was kind of interesting. There was surprisingly little music in a video about a band (and, from what I can tell, they're not all that good anyway). Still, it was a compelling story; you gotta respect guys who go so far and risk so much to live the dream. At one point, the place where they practiced got hit by a missle and they lost all their gear--how FUBAR is that. Headbanging can get you arrested (or killed)? That's nuts.

From what I understand, they live in New Jersey now and are in the studio working on an album. (I doubt it will be very good but I'll buy it anyway out of curiousity). Actually, the most interesting part of the film was the footage from them just driving around Baghdad; it was wierd to see a non-CNN perspective of the city...

Like I said, HMiB ins't great but I'd recommend in anyway.",1249948800,,881,4.365853658536586
3414889,3,B0018BZDRU,"Heavy Metal in Baghdad (Eddy Moretti and Suroosh Alvi, 2007)

For the last five years or thereabouts, Acrassicauda has been the name on the lips of many who keep their ear to the metal underground. Not necessarily because of their relative talent (though the footage here will likely convince you of their talent), but because Acrassicauda are the only metal band to ever emerge from Iraq. In 2007, the guys who run Brooklyn-based Vice magazine, who had been following the Acrassicauda story, released Heavy Metal in Baghdad, an indie doco about the band and the filmmakers' sometimes unsuccessful attempts to get to them--to their shows, to appointments for interviews, the lot. Publicity exploded, and wheels that had been stuck during the entire making of the film got greased. Acrassicauda (who, as we last see them here, are spinning their wheels in Syria) got themselves visas first to Turkey, and then to the U.S., where they now reside. (No jokes about the similarities between Iraq and north Jersey, please.)

While the film does manage to do what it set out to do, get publicity for the band and its story, when looked at as a film (as it must be now that that purpose has been accomplished), it does miss the mark in a number of ways. The biggest is exemplified by the final scene, during which the guys show the band a rough cut of the movie thus far; one of the band members blows up, going on a rant about how we in the west can turn the channel whenever we want, but this is their daily life. He's absolutely right, of course, but in every case we've gotten that feeling during this film, it's been related to us. Ever heard the expression ""show, don't tell?"" (It should be well-known to metal fans, at least, being the title of a hit by Rush.) This movie doesn't even try, and it's much the worse for that.

Balancing this is the concert footage, which is most likely the only extant footage of the band taken between 2004 and 2006, and is thus invaluable (especially of they end up getting big). Ever watch a movie like Get Thrashed! and wish that you had, say, footage of Exodus and Metallica in their first practice sessions in the very early eighties? That's what you're getting here in Acrassicauda flavor, and it's just plain awesome. You can trace the band's development over the years this movie was filmed, which is extremely cool, and when they're talking music, they know their stuff.

Put it all together and it's an odd mix that ends up working, albeit barely. Worth checking out, especially if you've heard of the band but haven't found anything out about them yet. ** ",1248739200,,2599,4.641304347826087
3414890,5,B0018BZDRU,"Synopsis:  Vice Magazine Co-founder Suroosh Alvi goes to Baghdad, Iraq to check out Acrassicauda, which holds the distinction of being the first heavy metal band in Iraq; playing metal in the vein of Slayer, Metallica, and Mayhem.  The beginning of the documentary starts off in 2003, nearly immediately after invasion in Iraq.  Though the band faces certain dangers (with the surrounding violence due to the war, along with the persecution they face for playing Western-style metal), they're relatively able to perform a show that was well received.  The documentary catches up with them again in 2006, where the violence was at it's all-time worst.  The band goes through separation, the surrounding violence and the effects on them and their families, as well as going through the destruction of their practice space and equipment.  Will these guys get out of Iraq?  And if so, will they be able to live in peace?**

First off, if I ever saw these guys, I'd be compelled to give them a hug.  This story struck me on a deep and personal level.  My friends and I had to move because of the economy in order to support our art.  These guys had to move to survive and to finally be able to express their art.  But there never was a lineup change; every one of them stood by each other and supported each other no matter how terrible things were.

But while the filmmakers are critical of the U.S. involvement in Iraq, these guys weren't very political about it; they just wanted to be free.  They just wanted to be able to do everything that we sometimes take for granted in the Western Culture.  Count your blessings that you were able to go see your friends today without fear of being gunned down.  Be glad you're able to express who you are freely; you don't always get that everywhere in the world.  At the end of the film, you're left hoping for the best for the band, their families, and their future endeavors.

** Side note and possible spoiler alert.  Though it wasn't covered in the documentary, all four band members managed to move to the United States by February 2009.  They're working ton a new recording now that they're stateside.  They're also taking on the actual metal look now that they're free to grow their hair long now and I think that absolutely rules!  I couldn't be happier and I hope living the U.S. works out for them. **",1244764800,,2351,4.614457831325301
3414891,5,B0018BZDRU,"""Heavy Metal in Baghdad"" chronicles a mere three years of the existence of Iraq's only heavy metal band, Acrassicauda (latin for Black Scorpion).  It's an eventful three years.  The band endured a war, a gunshot wound, gigs played with intermittent electricity, and a destroyed practice space before fleeing their country and learning a lot about the world and the true meaning of metal in the process.  And you too will learn more about real musicians and Iraq in this 90 minutes then in 100 years of 24-7 coverage on any mainstream news channel.  This is documentary filmmaking at it's very best.

The band began under the rule of Saddam Hussein, whose thugs told them that they could only perform if they wrote and played a tribute song for Hussein in person.  Yes, that man really was that full of himself.  The band derisively recounts that the tune itself wasn't bad but the lyrics praising the dictator by name were ""just a bunch of [...] lies and sh!+"".  Note that the members of the band ""perfected"" their English by listening to Slayer albums.  But even in this hardcore Islamist climate where wearing a Slipknot shirt is reason enough to be shot on sight, people hunger for the raw energy and catharsis that only heavy metal can provide.  The drummer has to fill his instrument with clothing to keep the noise down, and any expression of an art form viewed as evil and American risks their lives, but these people do it anyways.  The crowds bang their heads even though they are chastised for it's resemblance to Jewish prayer, they mosh politely on their knees so that they don't obscure the view to the tiny stage, they don Sepultera and Megadeth shirts; like you and me they live for this.  The difference between there and here is, they sometimes die for it.  Western metal bands sing about death.  These guys live it.

One member of Acrassicauda recalls being shot as he drove down the street following America's ""Mission Accomplished"".  With 300 civilian deaths daily, the young man asks if this is our democracy and freedom.  ""[...] this democracy"", he states matter of factly.  Looking at his bombed-out neighborhood, it's hard to argue.  When the band's practice space is hit by a rocket and destroyed along with their instruments after the extreme pains they took to put together a mere 6 shows in 5 years as the only metal band in Iraq, it's even harder.  In a city where the only music store was driven out of business because of death threats, vigilante Islamist militias disguise themselves as the police, and neighbors and friends don't see each other for months  because going out in the street is not a risk they are willing to take, it's DAMN hard to feel good about Bush's brand of democracy.  Particularly when the media continues to report how pleased the Iraqi citizens are with their new overlords. Acrassicauda's bassist delivers a firey lecture on just how far the news coverage has been from reality.  Lots of f-bombs are dropped.  He also points out that the whole jihad thing is a myth propagated by the media.  The truth: almost all Muslims are indistinguishable from anybody else walking down the street in any city in the world.  Seeing real footage of real people in Baghdad, you'd never think it was the same place portrayed in our media.

""Heavy Metal in Baghdad"" is a true reality check for both music fans and people who think they can know a damn thing about the world from watching the news.  When a bandmember holds up an Iron Maiden album cover and declares ""this is what life looks like here"", he laughs but he's not joking.  Armored humvees fill the streets, Apache helicopters fly by, they can tell which explosions are missiles and which are car bombs. This is real life to these people.  When Acrassicauda's formerly non-political singer directs his anger at the audience and accuses that this is the stuff we turn off when it comes on our television, I saw a man who'd grown up a lot.  He had previously declared that the band was not political and that he would change the channel when that stuff came on.  But three years of watching your country die and being forced to flee to Syria where he was not allowed to travel freely simply because of his nationality taught him a lesson.  Life is not fair, and we have no right to treat people as second-class world citizens simply because they were born in the wrong geographical area.  The previously non-political band records the first heavy metal album ever in the world's oldest city, Damascus.  Among the songs is a bitter, heartfelt view of the war that took his country from him.  Now he truly gets what metal is all about.

The band's reunion performance in Damascus is fantastic to watch unfold.  At first, a very few people show up and the band declares to the cameras that this will be Acrassicauda's final show. Risking your life to play this music just is not worth it if nobody even shows up to your gigs.  The band timidly opens with an 80's hair band cheese classic, having decided that they would stick to covers and try not to frighten away the small crowd they did have.  More people show up.  The band breaks in something a little heavier: a little Guns n' Roses.  The crowd continues growing in both size and excitement.  Acrassicauda breaks into Metallica's ""Fade to Black"".  The audience explodes.  Soon, the group's ultra-heavy original material is whipping the crowd into a frenzy; guess they won't be breaking up after all.  The simple fact is that music is a universal language.  Contrary to whatever regime is in power or what the social norms of a region are, there will always be an audience for true, passionate music that speaks to our deepest feelings.  It is a global phenomenon and it cannot be suppressed.

""Heavy Metal in Baghdad"" speaks to the viewer on many levels and does an amazing job of educating without ever talking down to the audience.  It shows us reality when all we get on television is propaganda and lies.  It shows us what it really means to have a passion for music; even if it invites your own death.  When asked why he would even take the risk of wearing a metal t-shirt, the musician simply states that he believes in his fate whatever it may be and he's ready to die if necessary.  How many top-40 fans would say such a thing?  Every emo kid who spends more time on his hair then practicing his instrument, every hardcore wannabe who screams venom at the parents who paid for his instruments, every trendchaser looking to make it big because you want to be rich and famous: take a good hard look. Acrassicauda is everything a true band or artist should strive to be.  The worst thing that will ever happen in your life is better then these guys' best day and they still carry on doing what they love ONLY because they love doing it.  If only we could all have that kind of integrity of character.",1240185600,6,6860,4.62396694214876
3414892,5,B0018BZDRU,"This was a brilliant documentary depicting the life of Iraq's only metal band in one of the deadliest parts of the world today. I enjoyed this film on 2 different levels. I am a HUGE heavy metal fan, so I liked the behind-the-scenes look at what is sure to be a successful metal band in the near future. Also, as a soldier and an American, I have been curious to see what life is like on the other side of the battle, from the eyes of the civilians whose home is now a battlefield.

That is exactly what this film shows. It shows the lives of ordinary men who are stuck in an unbelievable crossfire and their attempts to get out of harms way. These men love Baghdad, but realize that the war has made it impossible to live a normal life there anymore. The cameras follow the band on the early stages of getting away from the warzone, through Syria and Turkey. The film ends with the band still in exile and trying to get someplace more hospitible. The New York Times has now reported that the entire band now resides in New Jersey as of February 2009.

The special features include live performances and something of a sequel, or expansion of the original documentary. This DVD is well-worth the time and money. Easily 5 stars.",1235692800,,1227,4.400881057268722
3414893,5,B0018BZDRU,"This is a great documentary, regardless of whether or not you listen to heavy metal, or even whether you're liberal or conservative. This film wisely sidesteps political commentary and boils down the situation in Iraq to the experiences of a TRULY struggling heavy metal band in Iraq. All they want to do is play music, but this simple desire for creative expression proves practically impossible both during Saddam's regime *and* the American occupation. This really has to be one of the most spot-on, objective documents of the current situation in Iraq. Like I said, this isn't about heavy metal, it's about the struggles of living in a war-torn society. By narrowing the focus to a music band, the film is able to show us up-front the present reality of life in Baghdad. It's heartbreaking to see the human spirit gradually being stamped out of these guys This is a must see for any creative artist, and ultimately, any human being who appreciates living in a free society.

In addition to being a great film, the DVD itself is loaded with great special features, notably a 45-minute documentary follow-up to where the subjects of this film left off.",1231286400,2,1154,4.8578680203045685

I have talked to Firas Al-Lateef and Faisal Talal of Acrassicauda (Bass; Guitar/Vocals, respectively) on many occasions, and they are 2 of the nicest and most down to earth people i have ever known.

In Baghdad the band performs a rare concert, though they are living in constant fear due to the ongoing war. They seek refugee in Damascus, Syria. But here are stuck in dire poverty and treated as outsiders, though they do manage to put on a show and record a demo.

The main feature ends with the band wondering if there is any future for them in Damascus. But I would encourage all viewers to match the equally excellent bonus featurette, a forty five minute additional documentary that chronicles the band member's lives in Istanbul, Turkey, where they are living as illegal immigrants.

The band finds Istanbul to a be relatively modern city with some semblance of a metal scene. But they must apply to the United Nations for legal status or face potential deportation. Instead the UN requires them to move to a smaller city in eastern Turkey where the band faces, once again, an uncertain future.

I'm sure even the most struggling metal band from the USA or UK would admit they have it easy compared to these guys. The band desires only the opportunity to live freely and play the music they love. But are instead forced to live as refugees. They all hated Saddam. But say the war has only turned things from bad to worse, in what appears to be a hopeless situation.

After his fall, the dream of growing their hair and banging their heads in peace became even more daunting.  Their story is compelling.  ""Heavy Metal in Baghdad"" puts you in another world in the best documentary tradition and opens your eyes.  Based on the news it's easy for us to think of Iraqis as a bunch of religious nuts running around all day blowing each other up.  The reality is that while, yeah, there are way too many of that ilk, most Baghdadians aren't fanatics.  In their desire to pursue happiness they are are just like us.  In the case of Acrassicauda, amazingly like us in their tastes in music and English proficiency.

The filmmakers not only enlighten the viewer about Acrassicauda but also give a good look at the mess we made in Iraq.  The movie isn't overtly political, nor is the band, but we can see what the chaos has meant to the boys.  Multiply the horrible disruption of lives by a million or so to get an idea of what our adventure in democracy meant.

8269323,4,B0018BZDRU,"First, before I begin my review, I need to provide something of a disclaimer, which is the so called ""harsh parts"" of my review. Undertsand none of it has to do with the band themselves as it is EXTREMELY commendable for a group of people to do what they do because they like it and it doesn't hurt anybody while risking their very lives because somebody else doesn't like it (Tipper Gore and the PRMC anyone???). I found the documentary very interesting and good due to the nature of the bands situation, which very few bands in the world can claim to experience. On top of that, the local fans in Baghdad truly get what the Metal experience is all about, having a good time and enjoying themselves. I also enjoyed the first person perspective of the real life Iraqis have to deal and contend with, because this is as real as life gets in the modern world. This is truly a tale of the trials and tribulations of life that unfortunately placed these members in the situation they are in, but in the end, they managed to come out on top. Now, I know what I am going to say next is not exactly what most people want to read for an amazing documentary like this one, but I am willing to acknowledge the positives and negatives in an even playing field. The only gripes I have about this documentary is the whole ""blame America"" theme that popped up every once in a while during the documentary. If history indicates anything, is that people who are willing to rebuild and get back to a normal life will accomplish it (Look at the Germans after World War II, do you think they got to where they are today overnight??). I rate this documentary 4 Stars instead of 5 stars due to the obvious message between the lines the people who made the documentary were trying to showcase, which is the Michael Moore ""perspective"" of America, on the back of this great band, and they are great because of the passison and willingness to do what they want just to rock on.",1273881600,,1953,4.412742382271468

For all their brutality the Florida death metal mobs live in one of the freest countries in the world and in what is apparently a glorious climate (OK, hurricanes excepted).

For all their miserable imagery, the Euro goth bands live in gorgeous countries with truck loads of beautiful architecture, art and culture.

This documentary puts their respective head spaces into perspective when compared to the plight of the first Iraqi heavy metal band Acrasscauda and their attempts to just play gigs, let alone cut a demo of any description! This indie style documentary explains the story and spends a lot of time interviewing the members of this band and includes a chunk of archive footage of this mobs early live gigs - some played when Saddam Hussein was still in power. The story uses these flashbacks to link the story and it is pretty darn sobering seeing the band show the bombed out remains of their rehearsal space and the devastation visited upon the urban areas of Baghdad. It becomes clear that the years of warfare have left some serious mental scars and not all the band were able to be interviewed while the film makers were in Baghdad due to logistical issues.

As the story unfolds the lads end up fleeing to Syria like so many other refugees and some comic relief is provided by them trying to cut a demo - in a studio with no knowledge of how to record anything much other than traditional Syrian music and with the band having never been in a studio situation before. All up however this documentary doesn't pull any punches about the effects on the country of Iraq or its people, though rather cleverly it almost never strays from this personal level rather than delve into the politics of the situation.

The production values are very indie but actually that enhances things, the interviews are sometimes lively as is some of the footage though obviously the background to the whole situation means this is never breezy viewing. The DVD menu is easy to navigate and the bonus features that quite valuable as it shows the film makers returning to their contact with the band and updating the story with what has happened to the lads since the original documentary was released. This is valuable not only because you want to root for the underdog and wish them success but because it does give the viewer some closure to see that became of this tight knit bunch of men.

If you are into the heavy end of the music spectrum (and I'm not talking about some hefty lady at the opera) then this is a pretty cool DVD to put in your wish list despite it's at times dour subject matter.",1262390400,,2740,4.686070686070686
