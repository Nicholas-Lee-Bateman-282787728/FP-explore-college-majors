Great camera work with the contemplative scenes showing the ongoing movement and simple stillness of nature.  Images  of water in motion, light across ancient rock formations and stars slowly spinning across the sky are like art on the screen.  The music track meshes perfectly.  Looking forward to seeing this on my friends new large screen.",1229299200,2,495,5.1375
8308178,5,B001H9MLPK,"Perhaps the most insidious drift in our social consciousness during at first the industrial revolution and now the information age has been our growing spiritual estrangement from our own earth. We have elevated rational thought to gain short-term social benefits and shunned our mystical connection with the land we live on. We have paved it with concrete and punched oil wells through its skin to build our economies. Now we have sensed the errors of our ways, but we remain locked in a quest for a rational solution. However, it may well take more than our rational thought to heal the earth from the insults we have visited upon it. We will need both our rationality and our heart sense in this ultimate challenge.

Jan Nickman has created a film, ""Living Temples"", which searches for our lost spiritual connection with the land. Nickman's film does not dictate nor does it preach. It does not romanticize the past. However, it does remind us on some subliminal level, of what we have come to ignore. It does ask questions of the heart. The questions that it asks are the heart sense questions that we will need to heed as we move towards an uncertain future.",1226534400,4,1163,4.729064039408867
8308179,5,B001H9MLPK,"The images and music on this DVD are soothing and beautiful.  The sparse narration (by Linda Hunt) isn't really necessary to enjoy the DVD.  Its message - that we're part of the Earth, not its master -- is a good one, and using the images of the southwest and Native American imagery and flute music is evocative of the Older Culture perspectives espoused by Thom Hartmann.  Eckhart Tolle fans will notice and appreciate the stillness and ego-less presentation of nature here.  So, some good choices on content, stunning HD images, the David Lanz soundtrack is wonderfully non-intrusive.  I like to watch this DVD with the narration turned off (a nice special feature extra) and have a meditative nature experience when its too cold, or dark, or rainy, etc. to have one outside.  Or when I want to contemplate something a lot more majestic than my backyard!",1226361600,3,857,4.835616438356165
