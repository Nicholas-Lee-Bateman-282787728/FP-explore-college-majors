Take these guys and gal and put them in 790 Norway.  FUNNY stuff!  Only on Netflix I guess.  Norwegian name is Vikingane.  Amazon needs to have it!",1520899200,,324,4.213114754098361

Steven Van Zandt is brilliant in this Bizarre and hilarious comedy that mixes New York attitude with Nordic Noir and with a dash of Sopranos/Godfather.  I laughed so hard that I fell out of my chair.  Brilliant writing, awesome series.",1494374400,,291,4.666666666666667
