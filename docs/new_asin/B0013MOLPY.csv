8252177,5,B0013MOLPY,"I have shown this to my high school classes as part of expository and persuasive units of study in high school English.  It provides a wide variety of perspectives regarding use of  the internet, with a focus on social networking.  Just a few of the topics  explored are online bullying, implications of adapting online identities and personas, susceptibility to sexual predators, issues of personal privacy and parental censorship, and legal consequences of sending sexually explicit material to friends over the internet (including by phone).  The program is divided into several shorter segments which deal with different issues, making it easy to focus on one issue at a time for analysis and discussion in a classroom setting.  It is well-documented with personal interviews and a wide range of factual evidence, enhancing its value in studying authenticy and accuracy of research.

For parents who want to know more about the ways in which young people participate in and are affected by social networking on the internet, this program is an eye-opener.  Many interviews are conducted with parents who had no idea what their children were involved in until a crisis occurred.",1309996800,3,1181,5.211640211640212
8252178,5,B0013MOLPY,"I have shared this DVD with 18 year-old students (French students learning English) and they all wrote passionate essays after viewing it. These essays should be read by their parents for the parents could learn something about their children. Some of the students have had computers since they were 5 years old. They have literally ""grown up"" online. The idea of parental control was repugnant to them. Even at a younger age, they could not be so easily duped (by predators, etc.) They found the parents in this DVD were over-exaggerating their concerns. They were insulted to think that parents would try and control their (the youth's) internet access, since the internet is their (the children's) world - and the parents know little about the Net. How dare the parents try and control something they know little about. Almost all students said this.
Will try and put their feedback online.
