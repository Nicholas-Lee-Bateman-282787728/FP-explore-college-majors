7966353,2,B00006ANGN,"In this film, Ray Ellingsen teaches you to use different everyday items as self defense tools. The items used start from items you carry constantly with you, such as wallet, belt, jacket and shoes. Some of the techniques are meant to used with items that are not so commonplace, like a thing called WA-1 (some kind of guiding rod used in dog shows). I don't think that I will ever be walking around carrying a WA-1 with me to be deployed as a weapon.

In the film, they take one item at a time and present few techniques for each item. The techniques vary from simple distraction to a knife parry/control hold. The techniques are presented in enough detail, and using several camera angles. I liked that as they show the technique form the side, they have inserted a small image on the corner of the screen that shows the action overhead at the same time. There are some good and clever techniques, but mostly they are unrealistic and downright dangerous to perform. For example, all of the blocks with a cane are way too slow to work in real life.

I was disappointed with the film not only because of the unrealistic techniques but because this film does not teach you to look for really improvised weapons. Instead they just show how to use some items as weapons. I would much more preferred if they had taught the viewer how to use any item as a weapon, rather than choose some items and show some techniques for those weapons. The production of the film is good, and they have used different sets to shoot the film. In an aircraft setting, they use several extras as passengers. It is a pity that the contents are not up to par with the production.
