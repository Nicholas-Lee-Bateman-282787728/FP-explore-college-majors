Great actors, script and camera work.  I saw it at Shriekfest in Los Angeles and can't wait for the DVD, I have friends who love Good Thriller/Horror films and this one makes the perfect gift.",1197504000,14,353,4.318181818181818

8237481,5,B0010AEPJG,"I gave this movie 5 stars. Is it a 5 star movie? For the budget they filmed it with it's good, but if you're expecting a big budget hollywood thriller/horror flick this is not it. Popularity be damned, I never got into saw (other then the first one) and thought Hostel was retarded. This is neither of those films nor tries to be.

Mr. Dumont is a solid actor, he's been around on a lot of TV shows over the years and does a respecable role in this, certainly better then Mr. Cage in most of his more recent movies.

Very little horror in this one, and scarcely anything to be considered gory, but it's still not for the kids. Practicly no nudity, it's more of a character study then anything. Of  course there are a few murders but it's not prolonged. There are quit a  few Hermans out there (the dude with the cellar) in the real world, while likely not to the point of keeping hostages in their basement or murdering, just as disturbed.

I got my copy at Walmart, had 10 movies on 2 discs for 5 bucks. So yeah, great movie for .50 cents.",1473120000,,1040,4.232323232323233
8237482,3,B0010AEPJG,This is another movie that the producer or director does not know hold to hold the camera in one place and center it so you can see what you want to see. Please stop bouncing the camera around all the time.  The lady is in a cage!!! Not running and jumping all over the place. Even then it is very annoying to watch. I give this movie 2 stars. The story line was pretty good. Kept me interested.,1442707200,,395,4.064102564102564
8237483,3,B0010AEPJG,"In our opening scene we have a bloody fully clothed woman being hunted down by a man in his pajamas. Herman (James DuMont) is a connoisseur who collects only the finest in female parts. He quickly moves unto the next female, Rudy (Michelle Tomlinson) who must psychologically battle her captor in order to get released, all the while attempting to stay on Herman's good side and battling nightmares.

Okay. That's it for 85 minutes.

Herman is a balding middle aged man, who is socially inept. Rudy is a party animal lesbian The film is more of a thriller than horror. Once the woman is in the box, it seems like it takes forever for something to happen. Hey! Those clothes are wet!

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Near nudity.",1388448000,,728,4.627906976744186
8237484,1,B0010AEPJG,"I don't know what movie ""zombie junkie"" watched, this movie is ""COOLER"" (his words) than SAW (the highest grossing horror franchise ever) and hostel?!  Horrible actors, james dumont made me want to take the dvd out and smash it.  Terrible.  It's a tired premise, and is on par with Captivity.  BAD MOVIE",1286841600,3,303,4.769230769230769
8237485,1,B0010AEPJG,"And that's about the extent of it.  It was not pulse-pounding, riveting, or terrifying in any way, except that I was stuck watching another low-budget mess that could have been presented better if only some talent and creativity were involved in the process.  The characters and dialogue were unbelievable, and my heaving sighs of great discontent failed to move the film along any faster.  The psychological aspects of the characters' encounters bored me, and I felt myself drawn to meaningless minutiae to stay awake.

""You know,"" I say to the Significant Other, ""She can't lay down in that tall crate, and that's the sort of thing they do to torture POW's in camps.  He does care for her, and she would be in agony by now.""  Really.  I read about these sorts of things.  ""And how come her makeup is still fresh?  I look like a sewer rat if I haven't showered in two days, and she looks great.  I wonder if it's the shampoo I'm using?  Look at those jars, now that's kind of cool.  You know, he'd be feeding her pizza and take-out; men like that really aren't into cooking.""

Finally the movie crawls to a predictable end - ""Oh, look what happened!  Now, what are the odds of that?  Hmmmm?""  I am now trapped in a crate of my own, unable to justify the time and energy spent watching this movie.  Sighhhhhh....",1255132800,2,1312,4.514893617021277
8237486,4,B0010AEPJG,"A low-budget serial killer flick that focus's on the relationship between captor & captured instead of torture.
Almost the entire movie takes place in Captain Psycho's basement,
so there isn't much in the way of scenery, just a cage.
But it's a nice cage.
He ""got an A in shop class"".
A cage where he keeps women.
Well one woman at a time, till they die, or try to escape.
And during their luxurious stay he collectss pieces of them.
(You don't want to know what that means, but it's not what you think)
The movie starts off as he loses his last venture,
and continues as he finds, stalks, and captures a new obsession (all of this is in the first 5 -10 minutes)
The rest of the movie plays out like a less outlandish, infinitely better version of Captivity,
No bizarre torture scenes, no high tech surveillance equipment, or twist endings you could see a mile off shore.
Just a psycho, an altar, a beautiful woman, and a cage.
Not a terrible amount of gore.
There's enough though to keep a gorehound's appetite sated, but not enough to be considered overly gory.
Like another reviewer here stated; the creator of this flick is someone who deserves a bigger budget to work with.
There is a very minimalist approach to this story, but it's one that works.
This movie makes a loaf out of a slice of bread.
In both the positive (budget) and negative (plot) sense.
At the very least it's worth a rental.
A purchase if you like torture flicks.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
If you love something.... lock it your basement.
If it stays it'll love you forever,
If it dies it was never meant to be.

8237487,5,B0010AEPJG,"I've enjoyed seeing James Dumont in a number of films and in TV shows like CSI. He was great and ""scarily"" believable in The Cellar Door. I'm looking forward to the DVD bonus features!",1206576000,7,184,4.4411764705882355
8237488,1,B0010AEPJG,"Yay, another movie that's based on long loving shots of women being tortured and murdered. Where's the suspense? The movie substitutes gore for plot, predictability for originality, and has no surprises to offer. Big whoop. There was no plot to speak of, it was boring and sadistic, and the ending was no surprise. Sheesh. That's ninety minutes of my life I wasted.

 I wish I could give this negative stars.",1201132800,10,408,4.814285714285714
8237489,5,B0010AEPJG,"""The Cellar Door"" is a gripping game of cat and mouse.  It features amazing performances, a clever script, and first-class direction.  This movie didn't get much press initially, but make sure you catch it on DVD.  You won't be sorry.  Michelle Tomlinson and James Dumont create subtle, nuanced characters in this smart independent thriller where you're never sure what's what.  A very smart flick...with a killer ending.",1197590400,13,421,5.223880597014926
