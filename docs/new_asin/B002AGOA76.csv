Definitely a classic. if you didn't see this film, your probably the only one who didnt.",1258848000,,250,4.340425531914893
3884104,3,B002AGOA76,"I checked this flick out because it was filmed near my hometown and as a former film student myself I like to check out the Indie circuit and film making.  City is Mine had it's strong points and it's not so strong points.  The lack of a Hollywood budget is apparent but I thought the director did well with a ""less is more"" approach for the on screen violence.l  Characters were entertaining.  I especially liked Becky T Bordo and Keven Interdonato in this film.  Both of them have star potential.  Some of the editing and pacing could have been.  It was refreshing to see an urban drama that didn't star hip-hops flavor of the month.  Worth a watch and if you are into this genre you might want to toss it into the collection.  IMO.",1258848000,4,734,4.377777777777778
3884105,4,B002AGOA76,"I checked this one out on a friend's recommendation.  At first, I was a little worried as the flick carried a pretty small budget(unlike a lot of my collegues, I'm not a large fan of indie movies), but those worries quickly evaporated in the first 20 minutes.

-  Cool story
-  Well written
-  Well acted

Those were the main reasons I stuck with it, and I am glad I did.  It is not the first time a street story like this has been told, nor will it be the last, but this one was told with a certain grit and it felt more ""real"" than some of the contrived Hollywood trash floating around in movieland.  I'm not gonna give away any of the plot(check out a synopsis for that), but I can say it moves pretty well and hopefully jumpstarts the career of some of the actors in it(my fav are the main character and the corrupt cop).  Like it or not, these guys kept it 100.

Solid 9/10!",1258761600,,879,4.117647058823529
3884106,1,B002AGOA76,Not for me.  Ive seen state property 1 and 2.  Ive seen Masta P's I got the hook up.  This movie falls quite a bit short of them.  It also not cool that they made this a 4 star.  totally got me to play it for like 4 minutes.,1485043200,,224,3.489795918367347
3884107,2,B002AGOA76,A bad stupid movie it just shows what is happening in the inner city and people like it.  The only great thing is they are killing themselves which is good for real Americans.,1483660800,,175,4.303030303030303

powerful movie about the tragedy of drug gang rivalry and the deadly cost paid that those involved. the story centers around a drug dealer who has returned to the streets after doing five years in prison. he reunites with his former thugs, who inform about how things have changed, and they set up a plan to dominate the drug business and crush their rivals. The ex-con drug dealer is also involved with the sister of his gang rivals. The attempt to claim his city leads to many people being killed. There is also the problem of a crooked cop who demands protection money and who is killed in his car after taking his money, while a hooker is giving him head. The climax of this story happens when the ex-con and his gang invade the home of the rival gang leader and threaten him, His girlfriend enters the house. she tries to save her brother, but her boyfriend kills him. She holds him and cries because he is dead. One of the rival gang members tells the leader she has to be killed too. Not wanting to kill her, he leaves the house and his partner kills her. This movie shows the tragic folly of drug dealing and how there are no moral rules. Writing As Consolation is my new book Audible and Kindle by Richard Shaw.",1493942400,,1271,4.389830508474576
