8022107,5,B00024MH8C,I watched this movie in the late 80-s. It was funny at that time. I was afraid that with so much time passing it would lose its appeal and zest. I was wrong. It is a classic comedy in the true Gogol-ian style.,1287619200,,209,3.883720930232558
8022108,5,B00024MH8C,"I saw the movie in Czech Republic back in 1988. It was all in Russian on a black&white TV set. It was way before I saw the Star Wars movie for the first time. I tried many times to find out what movie that actually was. The only thing I was able to remember was the word ""Ecilop"". So today I finally looked it up and found this amazon item. I am ordering it as I type :-)",1223251200,,371,3.769230769230769
8022109,5,B00024MH8C,"I found out about Kin-Dza-Dza from a friend who noticed it was (at the time) #16 on the IMDB Top 50 Sci-Fi movies list.  I did some research on the film and quickly discovered that virtually nobody in the western world had seen it.  There were no English subtitled DVD releases, and no plans to release it anytime soon.  Of course this made the movie ever more appealing and I suddely HAD to see it.  I turned to my only remaining option...downloading it over the internet.

I found the movie (with fan-made English subs!) on Bittorrent, and within a week the movie had downloaded.  The subtitles are great, and the movie is a treasure!  If you're a fan of sci-fi or existentialism, this movie is both entertaining and philosophical.  The movie is a cult sensation in Russia, akin to movies such as Donnie Darko in the US.  It's really a shame that no one has made the movie available over here, because it would definitely find an audience with the proper word of mouth.  Movies like this tend to publicize themselves, you just have to get people to look at them in the first place.

I think the Criterion Collection would be the perfect company to introduce this great film to the rest of the world.  It's very culturally important in Russia (one of the scenes is an obvious critique of Communism that managed to make it past the censors!), and somewhat similar to Solyaris, another Russian Sci-Fi that has been put out by the collection.  The Criterion Collection carries with it enough prestige to get people to take notice and give the film a shot.  Plus, it'd be great to finally get some information of the movie and it's Russian influence!  All the pages with ANY information are in Russian, so I don't really know anything about the history of the film.  Anyway, this film is funny, smart and endearing.  If you are able to get ahold of a copy of the movie, I definitely recommend it!",1147824000,15,1893,4.553254437869822
8022110,5,B00024MH8C,"This movie I've watched about 15 times and I'm still can't get tired of it! It's amazing! It has very smart sence of humor and at the same time it is a drama, I really do recomend to watch this movie to anyone who likes masterpieces of russian cinematography.",1115856000,7,259,4.3061224489795915
8022111,5,B00024MH8C,"This movie was absolute entertainment for me. I purchased a Russian-only issue from an online vendor, even though my Russian vocabulary is about three words.

It didn't matter.

Starting when Dyadya pushes the button that takes him and Skripach to torrid Plyuk, I was glued to the screen. Slap your face, squat, and say ""Kuh!""

(I did it a few times after watching the film.)

This film contains no shortage of inventive new situations to entertain the audience: the aristrocrat with a croaking pet human, the helicopter-like bathyscaphes that fly through the air, the honking little device played while squatting and shouting ""Kuh!"", and the strange underground factories inhabited by strangely dressed savages.

This certainly isn't mainstream Russian film. If it were in English, it would be way out in left field as well. I highly recommend it to anyone who tired of the ""Star Wars"" fare.

Next time I wander out onto the street, I'll make sure to bring my matches.",1093910400,15,969,4.950617283950617
