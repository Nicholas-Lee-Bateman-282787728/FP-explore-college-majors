5071520,5,B007AAF2ZG,"I know a lot of fans are not too fond of the 7th Doctor, but this overall was an okay story.  We are also re-introduced to Sabalom Glitz from the previous season and a great guest appearance from Patricia Quinn (The Rocky Horror Picture Show)!  The only thing I found weird was the cliff hanger for episode one.  I don't want to give it away, but after you watch it, you're gonna be ""Huh?  Why'd he do that?""  I was kind of sad to see Mel go, though.  I think if she'd stuck along with Ace, they'd be both would be more trouble for the Doctor than he bargained for!",1329955200,7,565,4.090909090909091
5071521,3,B007AAF2ZG,"The plot of Dragonfire has some potential, and there are a few very good performances. Tony Selby is very good as Glitz. While Ace isn't immediately likable, this is her introduction story and there's certainly enough revealed about Ace to make the audience want learn more about her. And Edward Pael has some great maniacal moments as the villain Kane.

Yet, the story suffers from often being incomprehensible. There are moments like the literal cliffhanger at the end of Part One that has the Doctor lowering himself over a precipise via umbrella for no good reason. There's Glitz and the Doctor's attempt to steal back Glitz's spaceship and the Doctor suddenly abandoning the idea. ANd then there's that little girl running around. She's cute. Okay. What's she doing here. It's a confused mess of a story that still manges to be fun most of the time in spite of itself.",1430265600,,873,4.82

5071532,3,B007AAF2ZG,"Dragonfire by itself is an average story in the Doctor Who range.  It sees the return of Sabolm Glitz from Trial of a Timelord, and also introduces us to Ace a new companion for Doctor #7.  While there are some actors who could have stayed home in this tale, there are some strong performances from Edward Peel, Patricia Quinn and Tony Selby.  Bonnie Langford has her strongest story yet with the Seventh Doctor,and Sophie Aldred puts in a good performance for the moody Ace.  The story does lack in some ways with continuity, and the worst cliffhanger in Doctor Who may be seen at the end of episode 1.  However the final episode at least projects some feeling and horror when Kane does away with Belaz.  The extras are intriguing, and give some insight into how the story came about.  The screen test for McCoy was quite entertaining, and it was interesting to see him with Janet Fielding (aka Tegan).  I give this DVD 3 out of 5 stars overall.  Enjoy!",1344988800,,954,4.5321637426900585
5071533,4,B007AAF2ZG,"In the Sylyvester McCoy era of Doctor Who entitled ""Dragonfire"" The Doctor and Mel have landed on an ice planet only viable city.  There in the mercheant quarter they discover of all people Sabilon Glitz.  After convinciing Glitz that the Doctor is the Doctor, Glitz goes on to tell how he lost his ship in a card game and had to sell his crew to the city's govenor a strange man named Kane.  What none of them know is that Kane is raising an army and in time will return to his homeworld to conquer it and rule its people.
  However Kane has a problem he can not leave due to a vital componet needed to leave and the only way to get it is to search for the guardian a fire breathing dragon.  Something Kane fears and will not go near it.  Instead he tricks others into searching for it for him.  And right now Glitz is his latest victim and he thinks with the aid of the doctor they might just find what he needs.  Meanwhile Mel encounters a young woman named Ace working at the local malt shop.  A woman who was wisked from her home in the 20th century due to a bizarre time storm and landed on the planet she calls home now.  Together Mel and Ace try and figure out what the Doctor and Glitz are up to and figure out why Kane's people are tracking them.
  Will Kane get what he needs from the Doctor and Glitz? Will Mel and Ace be able to help?  And what does the dragon have to do with all of this and why it is connect to Kane in the first place?  Check it out in ""Dragonfire"" to find out.",1340668800,,1494,4.051194539249146
5071534,2,B007AAF2ZG,"It's rather difficult for me to say anything negative about the Sylvester McCoy Era, only due to the fact that I met the man, and as a person, I really enjoyed his company.  But as the Doctor... Realistically, I know that it was not his fault that he got the shortest stick, due to all the behind the scenes machinations at the Beeb which started during Colin Baker's time.  So I have to walk that fine line once again, trying to be as unbiased as possible as I write this.

Simply put, I can't help to note how times have changed as this program is now being compared to the new series!  Granted, it is only reasonable that some would compare these old series stories to the new ones.  And yet, there are a plethora of Doctor Who stories that I watched decades ago, and much to the satisfaction of my memory, as they are being released on DVD, and I love them just as much as I did then.

Dragonfire didn't quite hit that mark.

Setting the story aside, which I never recap since most people reading these reviews should already know the story, and if they don't, most other reviewers recapped that more times than I can count, I want to focus on what makes this DVD something you may wish to spend you hard-earned money on.

Mel departs as the Doctor's companion at the end of this story and Ace takes her place.

Well, that pretty much covers it.

I feel that the commentary was more entertaining than the show itself.  The participants of the commentary are, Sophie Aldred / Ace, Edward Peel / Kane, Andrew Cartmel, / Script Editor, Chris Clough / Director, and Ian Briggs / Director.  Several of these contributors are in only one or two of the three episodes.  Personally, I feel that if a person can't contribute something to all of the episodes, then they shouldn't be included.  Miss Foster trimmed the fat for the Adapose, I think it's time 2|entertain did the same.  And why no Sylvester McCoy or Bonnie Langford as participants in this commentary!?!

Other features of note are:
""Fire and Ice"" - This 35 minute feature features Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, Andrew Cartmel, Ian Briggs, and others as they talk about the making of this story.  I usually find these type of features interesting, and this one was, but not as much as others have been in prior releases.

""The Doctor's Strange Love"" is a 16 minute discussion between three people who have NO INVOLVEMENT in the show expressing their opinions.  Frankly, I find this insulting.  Would any of you buy a DVD of me expressing my opinions of a Doctor Who show?  I think not.  I didn't even bother to watch this to the end.

""The Big Bang Theory"" is a 12  minute long feature with new series special effects director, Danny Hargreaves.  He talks about the way some explosions were done in the original series, as well as how they are done today.  I personally found this to be very interesting.  But then again, I sleep with a can of nitro 9 under my pillow.

After these features, there are some deleted and extended scenes, which is where it begins to fizzle.  Realistically, putting aside the obligatory commentary track, ""Fire and Ice"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" are the only real ""bonus"" features.  So I have to say that 2|enterain gives VERY LITTLE  to make this worth your money.  I feel that instead of allowing 2|entertain to symbolically defecate on us consumers, we should just go to their corporate office, and literally do it to them.

My BOTTOM LINE is, Dragonfire is something to ""Possibly Consider"" if you are a true fan of McCoy and Aldred.  But if you're the type who prefers to spend their hard-earned cash on something that will give you a bit more satisfaction, in my opinion, I regret to say that this may not be for you.  I would even go so far as to say that it was a good ""kids"" story back in its day, but while some ""kids stories"" have withstood the test of time, this isn't one of them.

I hope that this review was helpful to you, and please feel free to express your opinion(s) as well as post any questions on this review so that I can hopefully improve upon this one, as well as future ones.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully, consider my humble opinion(s).",1337472000,16,4182,4.476882430647292
5071535,4,B007AAF2ZG,"It seems a lot of the criticism of ""Dragonfire"" revolve around it having a derivative and/or cliched and/or uninventive plot. I can only disagree with that by saying that I rather get a kick out of trying to identify references, and that, overall, I think this is a fun (average) episode.

First aired in 1987, this is the episode where Dr. Who (Sylvester McCoy) first meets Ace (Sophie Aldred). It starts off with the TARDIS landing on Iceworld, a trading colony on the planet Svartos. The Doctor and his fellow traveler, Melanie and her squeaky voice, meet, of all people, the lovable rogue, Sabalom Glitz. The Doctor first ran into Glitz in ""The Mysterious Planet"", part 1 of ""Trial of a Time Lord"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Trial-of-a-Time-Lord-Stories-144-147/dp/B001C71IGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Trial of a Time Lord (Stories 144 - 147)</a>

Glitz is in debt to Kane, a mix of mobster, Mr. Freeze and Emperor Palpatine, who's body temperature is so low he can kill you just by touching you. Kane manipulates Glitz into searching for Dragonfire, a treasure guarded by a dragon deep in Iceworld. Mel runs into Ace, a waitress who needs another line of work. The Doctor, Mel and Ace find out that the Dragonfire is actually a power crystal guarded by a creature. Kane's spaceship is actually his prison, and he needs the crystal to power it off the planet. There's an underlying story of eternal love and an ending that could have been total pathos but got a little rushed. Call me schmaltzy.

This review is of the 2012 DVD, the first time ""Dragonfire"" has been issued on DVD. It will have digitally remastered picture and sound quality (still mono, though). Extras:

1.  Audio Commentary by Sophie Aldred (who plays Dorothy Gale, aka Ace), Edward Peel (Kane), Ian Briggs (writer), Ian Cartmel (script editor), Dominic Glynn (incidental music composer) and Chris Clough (director). It includes this comment by Briggs: [The Dragon] ""was always meant to be... a Ridley Scott/H R Gieger-type design. The alien was called a dragon in terms of terminology and folklore. It was never supposed to physically resemble one."" I think they did a pretty good job of making it Alien-ish, though when you listen to the commentary, everyone is making great fun of the costume.
2.  ""The Big Bang Theory"" Special Effects Supervisor Danny Hargreaves gives a little tour of things blowing up throughout Dr. Who history, from Patrick Troughton through David Tennant, including the difficulty of blowing a Dalek's top.
3.  Deleted and Extended Scenes
4.  Photo Gallery, accompanied by music by Dominic Glynn
5.  Isolated Score. Listen to Glynn's score without voices or sound effects
6.  PDF (CD ROM). Radio Times listings, plus a little banner show showing all the past doctors.
7.  Coming Soon Trailer

(Added after my DVD was delivered and watched:)  In the audio commentary, Ian Briggs, writer, explains that many of the ""homage"" names in the episode didn't actually start out that way. While he was writing the script, he gave ""place-holding"" names to characters, the idea being that he'd go back and change them to ""real"" names. So he just used names that popped into his head from his interests and reading, etc.  The names weren't changed, thus were born the ""homages"". Several of them are over my head.

5071536,4,B007AAF2ZG,"Ace! Sort of Dracula is space, with ice... The imagery is pretty clear. DragonFire is the 7th Doctor story that intros ACE who stays at his side until the series ""hattus' though the 90's... Ace is the most interesting character to come along in ages... She is an Earth girl who likes to blow things up and is inexplicably lightyears from Earth. The story is a bit of a treasure hunt with a typically ineffective set, by Slyvester McCoy, the Scottish Doctor, is a pleasure to watch even at the era's worse offerings... Although, The Doctor's self- imperilment  only to close the first ep with a 'literal' cliffhanger is perplexing to watch. But on the plus side Mel departs by the end. This is the beginning of a bit of a new direction for the 7th Doctor, trending toward darker territory.",1331942400,7,788,4.588652482269503

5071538,1,B007AAF2ZG,"This is from the miserable first season for the 7th Doctor (Sylvester McCoy). All of the stories that year were a mess from top to bottom.  Attempts at humor were unfunny and everything else was just squirm-inducing or deadly boring. There was also an extra cheesiness in production values that carried over from the final Colin Baker season. The only advantage that 'Dragonfire' has is that it is a whisker better than the previous stories of the season because it introduces Ace and says farewell to the unendurably chirpy Mel.  I'm not saying you should buy it, though. Staring at the ceiling would be at least twice as entertaining as sitting through this.

There was hope, however, and the following season began with the excellent Remembrance of  the Daleks&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Remembrance-of-the-Daleks-Special-Edition-Story-152/dp/B000Z7G87W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Remembrance of the Daleks (Special Edition) (Story 152)</a>&nbsp;, which you should very definitely buy, and Sylvester McCoy's Doctor was redeemed.",1330473600,5,1102,6.183006535947713
5071539,1,B007AAF2ZG,"After the wake of Tom Baker's Departure and the glow of the shows 20Th anniversary ( and the admirable Peter Davison era), Doctor Who had great difficulty in staying afloat. Then producer John Nathan Turner's Attempt to broaden the show horizon's by making it more adult oriented with episodes like Caves of Andrazani and Revelation of the DAleks and his attempts to finally bring the show to the global stage were met with stiff resistance from the British public who claimed the show as theirs and their's alone. Add to the fact the EXTREAMLY unfortunate promotion of a BBC controller who was the one of only two people in all of Great Brittan ( the other being Mary Whitehouse) who did not like Doctor Who and thus you had a recipe for the incredible silliness that is Dragonfire and the whole of the 7Th Doctor era. With axe in hand ready to cancel the show he despised from what seemed like birth, then BBC Controller Michael Grade slightly bowed to public pressure and keep the show around for three more years promising to ""return the shows to it's roots as a British children's television institution"". An boy did he succeed. Dragonfire is a story that ONLY children would enjoy...Children under five that is. To this day I can still remember watching this episode in complete horror and shock over how far the show had fallen in so quick a time. Dragonfire fails miserably from the scene one. Sylvester McCoy's buffoonery is embarrassing to watch, the studio bound sets look worse than ever for a show that had been on so long and the monster in this story looks like it belong in the 1960's. Main Villain Kane is played with lack luster appeal by Edward Peel (usually much better than this) and the one dimensional plot seems stretched to the limit by the middle of episode two (of 3).
The episodes one saving grace is the return of Tony Selby as Glitz (from the Colin Baker era). However he seems completely out of place here. From the reviews of this nonsense and the even worse Happiness Patrol, It seems the very few fans that like these horrific stories have come out guns blazing ( or five stars blazing ) in favor of them while the LEGION of who fans who abhor  them have remained silent. Most likely because these stories are so bad that they are not worth wasting time to review. I don't blame them as I feel dirty even thinking about these stories again much less writting a review. But in the interest of providing a fair and balanced pool of reviews I feel I must. In short avoid Draonfire, The Happiness Patrol and the 7Th doctor era like you would avoid the plague. It destroyed classic Doctor Who's credibility with fans and it DID cause the shows cancellation.
It's complete garbage.",1330214400,7,2709,4.597107438016529
5071540,3,B007AAF2ZG,"It's been a great many years since I last saw Dragonfire. At the time I (a lad of around 14) liked it so much I bought the novelisation. But time has not been kind to this story, at least in fan opinion, and it's often ranked among the worst Who stories ever made. I don't think that's true, though, and am looking forward to deciding for myself when it's released in May :~).

Upon watching most of it again for the first time in ages, Season 24 hasn't been anywhere near as bad as its reputation (well, except for Time and the Rani, that is) and actually has been very fun in places, Paradise Towers & Delta and the Bannermen especially. I hope this final story of that season continues that trend for ne. If nothing else it features the return of Sabalom Glitz, the farewell of Mel (who I've grown rather fond of over the years, at least more than I used to be) and the introduction of one of my very favourite companions ever, the redoubtable Ace.
