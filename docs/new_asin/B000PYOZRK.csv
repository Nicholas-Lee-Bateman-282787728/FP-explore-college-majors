2828981,5,B000PYOZRK,"I had forgotten just how funny Jerry Lewis was.  In his early age and for the times, this was a hoot!  I enjoyed going back and remembering how simple things once were.  No sex, violence, cursing, just good clean fun by a natural born mess up!",1406678400,,243,4.239130434782608

2828985,3,B000PYOZRK,"This is JL playing an inept, well-intentioned but totally bereft of common sense soldier. Nowadays, the ""Sad Sack"" would've been put on medications and booted out of the service but then, that does NOT a comedic movie plot make!",1399593600,,228,4.871794871794871
2828986,4,B000PYOZRK,"For myself, slapstick comedy was a way to connect to my youth I guess. Who better to do it with than one of the greatest teams of yesteryear.....",1396742400,,145,4.214285714285714

2828989,4,B000PYOZRK,"Lewis did a great performance in this film, one of my all-time favorites next to the nutty professor, it proves that you can have a comedy and still allow the goof to have a little since in his head. On a personal note it never fails to amaze me how men and women in this era are always portrayed as drooling monkeys and sex starved and that a woman can't be in charge because of their emotions getting in the way.
I love it when Lewis mixes comedy with a bit of seriousness and ability's and not just a lot of slap stick. You can't go wrong with this one, set back and enjoy.",1358380800,2,576,4.06140350877193

It is so funny and I plan to save this one to show my great-grandchildren for when they come to visit. This movie will probably make more Jerry Lewis fans once they watch this during their visit.

2829018,4,B000PYOZRK,"At times slapstick, at other occasions verbally subtle, the humor of Sad Sack entertains. In this story, a womans face doesnt launch a thousand ships but triggers unfolding action. She is a nightclub entertainer as a singer and dancer who falls for Bixby, the protagonist. Bixby proposes to her, which proposal she accepts, Later, Bixbys buddy interferes resulting with the engagements end. Bixby reacts by doing something extreme yet fitting for the character. Dolan, Bixbys Army buddy, in his voice-over, says, Bixby doesnt react as would a typical guy, killing himself. Instead, Bixby does something drastic. He leaves a note announcing to everyone hes gone AWOL. He intends to join the French Foreign Legion but instead becomes involved with underworld types. In response, Dolan and another character successfully rescue Bixby. In the end, its not Bixby who gets the girl but Dolan.",1453248000,,886,5.246478873239437

There's the movie about our hapless hero living and training on the army base and then there's the second story of the mission to Morocco.
