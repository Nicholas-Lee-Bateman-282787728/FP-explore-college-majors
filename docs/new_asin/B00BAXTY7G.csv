5568584,5,B00BAXTY7G,"Well done and entertaining.  Michener's book outlines the content that is factual and that which is fabricated to tell the story of Texas.  This is my second copy, and I never get tired of seeing the movie.  Acting is superb, and the story is believable.

5568625,1,B00BAXTY7G,"Not what I expected.  I haven't red the book, but Mitchner usually gives ancient history leading up to contemporary.  This was only a small segment of the history of Texas.  Granted, it had some good information and had the major players of the segment he gave, but I just was so disappointed.",1463097600,,293,4.596153846153846
5568626,2,B00BAXTY7G,"As a former Texan and a fan of Michener who gobbled up the book as soon as it was published, I was really looking forward to this movie.  I know that liberties have to be taken to adapt the written word to the movie screen.  I realize that they had to focus on one relatively short section of Michener's 1,100-page tome.  Nevertheless, Steven Austin came off as a wuss (how many times did they have to emphasize that he doesn't drink liquor?  Why can't he have the girl and found a new country, too?)  Jim Bowie in the movie is basically an amiable drunk who's fast with his knife.  And the movie's choppy.  In one scene, Bowie is talking with Austin.  In the next, he's lying on a pallet at the Alamo with no explanation of what disease/accident has brought him to death's door even before facing the Mexican Army.  In real life, Jim Bowie was married to a Mexican woman and owned a lot of land but you'd never know that from the movie.  My next point is a spoiler: the two Mexican soldiers riding with Benito Garza kill the woman, Maddie, but make no attempt whatsoever to shoot Steven Austin -- who should have been their target.  This was a nonsensical plot point.  Overall, the story line seemed rushed (even with three hours) and the visuals weren't sharp.  I bought a DVD instead of streaming video because I planned to keep this in my personal collection, but it's going to get donated to the public library.",1462665600,12,1416,4.441860465116279

The story line is OK but you are not going to do a good job on a huge Michener book in three hours. There's a lot of shortcuts taken in telling the story.,1450915200,9,275,3.9285714285714284

5568640,3,B00BAXTY7G,"We bought the movie this year (2015) - the film has little to do with Michener's excellent, eponymous book.
Watching it once is enough for us.
I recommend reading the book. I also recommend reading all of J.M.'s books. He researched thoroughly, bringing history to life.
A much better told story was/ is the mini series 'Centennial,' made after James Michener's same-titled book.
In both cases, I would like to add, one must forgive the film industry for the comparatively bad quality they had to deal with in the 80s. :)",1450310400,4,521,4.736263736263736

5568654,2,B00BAXTY7G,"The storyline and actors were mostly great. However, far too much time was spent going back and reviewing the movie. I would think perhaps most of one whole disk was used for this purpose. Putting credits, actors names on between each segment was also just a time filler, as the reviews were. The actor's names only needed to be put on once. It would have been much nicer to run the movie all at once, with no interruption, other than to change DVD.  If it is  possible, I would like a refund of the product purchase price. You certainly can tell by my comments, I am not happy with my purchase.

Thanks for the prompt service.",1403481600,,311,4.368421052631579
5568704,3,B00BAXTY7G,"We all know the story about the birth of Texas as an independent country, don't we? Grainy with decent sound, this is OK but not good in any manner.",1403481600,,148,4.137931034482759

5568708,4,B00BAXTY7G,Reading Texas and then seeing a movie makes a fine mixture of James Michener journey through Texas History in an enjoyable way. A fine author and one pleasurable one to meet.,1397001600,,174,4.645161290322581
5568709,3,B00BAXTY7G,"Having read many of Michener's topically historical pieces, this wasn't too bad but could have been much better in the hands of a story-teller not intent upon overlaying a current PC point of view upon a production designed to bring a tale to the big screen.  It's a good excuse for sitting down with a bowl of popcorn, or industrial chips (like some managers prepare at Albertson's) and homemade avocado dip.  Michener, too, was intellectually full of himself, believing as he did that only a few people like himself were tempermentally and intellectually disposed to rule the rest of us.  Over time, his writing became lazy, predictably patterned  after earlier successful story outlines.  More than once, while reading one of his books, I had to smack myself around to stay awake.",1396137600,,783,4.9465648854961835
5568710,2,B00BAXTY7G,"Would really have enjoyed this piece of history but the narration during crucial moments, that droned on and on made it difficult to watch. Would rather had an overview on a separate dvd.",1395964800,,187,4.696969696969697

5568718,5,B00BAXTY7G,"Saw this film years ago, and it finally became available and at a price I could afford...an excellent story of Texas and the men and women who settled the Republic of Texas and then continued the fight for its statehood.  A love story of a woman who loved Stephen F Austin, and of the love he had for another in his life, his beloved Texas...A really great movie but also an excellent lesson in Texas history.  I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves reading about the Western Movement and the role it played in the development of our country.",1390176000,,554,4.475247524752476

5568722,5,B00BAXTY7G,"My college professor made us watch this movie for credit, and I loved it. I couldn't find it on Netflix, in Red Box, or anywhere, until I searched amazon. I am so glad they had it! I live in Texas, and this is a marvelous tale of how the state became what it is today, there is even a short part about the alamo thrown in there :) The reason I purchased it, even though it was about 20 bucks, and I never buy movies til they hit the $5 bin at walmart, is because I am homeschooling my kids, and I felt that even though it is a bit brutal for a child to watch, it really captures the history, and keeps relatively close to the actual story of Texas. They enjoyed watching it. The movie is educational as well as interesting, and sometimes it is hard to combine the two, especially in history, one of my sore subjects. Great actors in it, you should recognize most of them, and they do a great job of re-enactment. The best part about the item was, it wasn't damaged, and worked exactly like a movie is supposed to work! I have gotten DVD's in the past that were not secure and the inside plastic parts of them scratched the disc... But not this one, it was perfect!! Enjoy the show!",1384646400,83,1181,4.1615720524017465

5568725,5,B00BAXTY7G,"Great Actors in this inspiring movie focused on the start of the Great State Of Texas.  Rick Schroder, Benjamin Bratt, Randy Travis, Stacey Keach and Patrick Duffey ..... were outstanding in their roles.  Great Movie.",1383091200,20,217,5.171428571428572

5568727,3,B00BAXTY7G,I've seen other Michener videos centennial for example. Cbs slumped on this one. The book was so much better with much more details than this disappointing video,1382400000,,161,5.0
5568728,5,B00BAXTY7G,"This is a wonderful epic!!! Packed with history, details, stars & adventure. Great action for youngsters, historic appeal for the so minded, nicely undertones love story, good acting and great all around mini-series. As for as ratings, I would rate this a PG. Violence is definitely involved, but is REQUIRED for the story. Remember parents, if your child learns History, they learn violence!!! Can't have conflict w/o violence.

5568730,4,B00BAXTY7G,I recommend this movie and was lucky to get the movie in a fast turn around period.  If anyone watches this movie and is not inspired by it's content needs to reevaluate their western opinions  :),1381536000,,196,4.416666666666667
5568731,2,B00BAXTY7G,Such a bitter disappointment after having read Michener's excellent novel. The movie was an amateurish attempt at telling the most exciting parts of the book while leaving out important character development. My advice would be to stick with the book!.,1377216000,4,252,5.325
5568732,4,B00BAXTY7G,"I loved this movie as I am a huge Michener fan. It tells a story that can open your eyes to how Texas won it freedom from Mexico. The only thing wrong with this movie is that it was changes somewhat from the book, as are all the ""from book to movies"" are. Over all the changes did work and the movie was very well done.",1376265600,,319,3.8484848484848486
5568733,5,B00BAXTY7G,"Michener wrote the book to illustrate the multiracial background of Texas.  With the movie he felt it was Pro-American and denigrated the Hispanic residents which was not what he had in mind.  The book was a great read as was the movie if you ignored the flag waving.  The main character ended up the villain who was shot down.  There was no Maddie Quimper but there was the""Old 300"" who accompanied Austin into Texas.",1373760000,,418,4.608108108108108
