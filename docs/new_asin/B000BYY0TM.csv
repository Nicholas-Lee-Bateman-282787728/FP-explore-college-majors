2449833,4,B000BYY0TM,The dvd is in good shape.  I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite actors in this Jules Verne remake.,1282176000,,98,4.157894736842105
2449834,3,B000BYY0TM,"This may have been a good movie . . . but my husband and I wouldn't know.  Hallmark neglected to Closed Caption it, and a lot of what we heard was ""Mumble mumble.""  In fact, that's the second (and FINAL) Hallmark DVD that we have purchased which did not have Closed Captioning.  The scenery is gorgeous.  I do feel that manufacturers who refuse to spend the money to help hearing-impaired consumers should be forced to indicate on their packaging that the item is NOT Closed Captioned.  And Amazon, whom I dearly love, should also clearly state in their description whether or not the item is Closed Captioned.",1225670400,2,610,4.663551401869159
2449835,5,B000BYY0TM,What can I say. I am a Patrick Stewart and Jules Verne fan. Their are a few twist from the book and earlier movie but a good movie over all.,1204848000,2,140,3.7
2449836,3,B000BYY0TM,"Return to the days of yesteryear - or kidhood Sunday Afternoon lounging around the living room with cheeze puffs and watching tv and waiting for the giant bugs, lizards and other monsters coming to trash those poor shipwrecked, or primitive or whatever they're doing on the beach waiting to be big crab food - people.

Mysterious Island is a Hallmark Mini-Series that harkens back to those fond times when we watched films that dreamed they could afford Ray Harryhousen effects, but instead just filmed an iguana with an extra horn stuck on it's head, the poor thing.

The acting and script are quite good, with Kyle McLachlin doing well as Cyrus our stand up, decent hero.  Patrick Stewart is perfect as the distant, cynical, anti hero of Captain Nemo.

The drawback is some really, really cheesy CGI work, but all in all, with this sort of story and the hearlding back to Sunday afternoon giant iguanas, this is certainly forgivable.  However, the matting with volcano was rather lame.  However, the acting works to helps balance that off.

Do see it.  It's as much fun that you can have with a tv movie that doesn't have a zombie in it.",1148860800,10,1139,4.688442211055277

like to see the next one.",1455580800,,57,3.8333333333333335
8094579,2,B000BYY0TM,"I read the book about 50 years ago, and remember it as a little mysterious, a little boring, and a little pointless.

This 3 hour movie is not mysterious, very boring and definitely pointless.

Even the science fiction, and leaving reason behind, is not credible.  Fancy a giant scorpion having the female lead between its claws, being attacked on all sides, and not closing its claw.

The butler had the only reasonable part (which wasn't much - reminded me of The Lost Horizon butler), the pirates were rejects from Monty Python, and the other actors were just boring actors with boring parts.

The island had the best part with the over-head views.

Not worth watching.",1439078400,,672,4.8

8094583,1,B000BYY0TM,"It's always a bad sign when a movie adaptation includes the name of the original author -- it usually means that it has nothing to do with the original story.

So I had a feeling of dark foreboding before watching ""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island,"" an alleged adaptation of Jules Verne's classic sci-fi/adventure novel. Technically it was made by the Hallmark Channel, but it's more the sort of fare that the Asylum churns out for the SyFy Chanel -- plotless and weak, horrendous special effects, and a couple of good actors clearly just there for the paycheck.

A bunch of escapees from a Confederate prison camp manage to escape in a conveniently-placed, unguarded hot-air balloon, and are quickly blown out to sea. When it crashes on a mysterious island (title check!), Captain Cyrus Smith (Kyle MacLachlan) is picked up and brought to the house of Captain Nemo (Patrick Stewart with a dishtowel on his head), an eccentric steampunk genius who wants the rest of the world kept at a distance.

While looking for food and water, Cyrus' companions quickly find that the island is overrun with giant, poorly-rendered CGI animals. But Cyrus immediately distrusts Nemo because of his obvious lies and his checkered past. And at the same time, a mysterious medallion that shows the location of ""Isabella's Treasure"" on the island have attracted Captain Bob Harvey (Vinnie Jones) -- which sounds like a folk singer's name -- and his crew of cutthroats.

""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island"" could be forgiven for being a terrible adaptation of a Jules Verne novel, but it can't be forgiven for being a terrible movie. This entire trainwreck REEKS of casual ineptitude, and pretty much every part of it is embarrassingly halfhearted -- it genuinely feels like nobody cared, so they simply slapped together elements of Verne, ""Treasure Island"" and SyFy monster movies.

There isn't really a plot here -- people run around and things happen, but rarely with logical progression. Giant CGI animals (whose origins are never sufficiently explained) occasionally attack when things get too dull. The dialogue is too predictable and mediocre to even bother remembering, and there are a number of gaping plot holes that they never even try to address. It's hard to tell if laziness or lack of enthusiasm were responsible.

And the characters are as thin as paper, and can be summed up in two or three words -- Stalwart Hero, Generic Love Interest, Cowardly Confederate Soldier, Teen Girl, Faithful Manservant and so on. None of them develop beyond that, and it's a chore to even remember their names other than Nemo.

Most of the actors are either terrible or sleepwalking through their roles. Kyle McLachlan is particularly wooden, Gabrielle Anwar seems confused about where she is, and Vinnie Jones is just PAINFULLY bad, talking in a silly gravelly voice like a Monty Python parody of a pirate. Patrick Stewart is one of the few bright spots -- while he clearly doesn't care, he still gives a pretty decent depiction of Nemo. And you can spot the debut of Tom Mison (of ""Sleepy Hollow"") playing a smart, subtle young pirate who manages to make Jones look even worse, just because he's really good.

""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island"" is too inept to be cheesy fun, too dull to be so-bad-it's-good. Aside from aficionados of Stewart and Mison, it's not worth seeing for anyone.",1389657600,2,3361,4.967971530249111
8094584,4,B000BYY0TM,Great movie its not a long strong out movie that last for a long time its a good movie it keeps your attention I thought it was great,1378771200,,133,3.7857142857142856
8094585,3,B000BYY0TM,"If  viewed over a two day period, there are two segments,  the film provides decent family viewing, but will be a bit hard on the adults. The film is too stereotypical, offering nothing much  to separate itself from the standard Treasure Island movie; this makes it somewhat of a drag for the adult segment of the audience. It should keep the younger ones happy, although the older segment of that group will find the technology pretty primitive.
The actors are given little scope to shine but Patrick Stewart and Roy Marsden do stand out despite the limitation of the material. On the other hand, the role meant to be the backbone of the heroics, played by Kyle MacLachlan, fails to rise above a wooden conventionality. The others perform with professional competency but none are allowed to infuse their parts with  meaning.
Over-all, a routine experience for adults, good movie for the kids.",1371600000,,894,4.8618421052631575
8094586,5,B000BYY0TM,"First watched it on TV and enjoyed it.  It is a show of adventure and thrills and I will continue to watch it many more times.  I first read the story for my own enjoyment and also in school.  Movie and book are different and that makes it
fun and sometimes you end up reading book again just to see how different.",1348790400,,314,4.032258064516129
