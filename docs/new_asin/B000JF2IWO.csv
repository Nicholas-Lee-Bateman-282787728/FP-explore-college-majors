8150138,1,B000JF2IWO,"I was expecting something like Riverdance.  Boy was I wrong.  The music was nothing special; no catchy tunes; no inspired lyrics.  The production was obviously on a very tight budget and the acting was not at all professional. Will never watch it again, in fact, I trashed it !",1382400000,,277,4.612244897959184
8150139,5,B000JF2IWO,"A two disc set, the show disc is good and the Documentary disk tells about the Scotch-Irish who came to America before the Revolution.
All Americans will enjoy the story no matter their own ethnic background.
An uplifting Musical.",1213574400,,230,4.923076923076923
8150140,5,B000JF2IWO,"If you love music and dance mixed with history than this is for you. Filmed live with a huge cast of professional dances from several different styles, it is the story of the journey of the Scots-Irish from Scotland to Ireland and eventually to America. Even though it is about one nationality of people the message and story of the immigration of the Scots-Irish can be seen reflected in the stories of all people who immigrated to America.
Featuring the powerful voice of Scots-Irish singer Peter Corry and the beautiful Scottish singer, Alyth, you learn of the hardships, difficulties and joys of a people who had such powerful impact on American history but have been largely unknown.",1186704000,2,688,4.888888888888889
8150141,5,B000JF2IWO,"This is such a wonderful portrayal of the Scots-Irish journey to America. The music is magical and inspirational, the dancing is the best of our hertiage, the story spectacular. It's a wonderful journey of emotion from sadness to laughter. Well worth it!",1166313600,5,254,5.071428571428571
