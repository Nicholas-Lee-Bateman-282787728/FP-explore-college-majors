8566619,5,B00BD7LIVE,"""Sexy Buffalo Boys"" is one of the most endearingly charming and entertaining independent films featuring gay production and talent that ever I have seen. (It also is known by the alternative title, ""Longhorns"".) The budget for the project, obviously, was limited, but no large-scale effects or artificial settings were required, so a lot of money was not needed (or probably even desirable).

Jacob Newton, as Kevin, is a real cutie, coltishly exuberant and sensuously irresistible, perfectly cast in the central role of one truly oversexed young dude, good at bedding the college women, but also, it turns out, even better in bed with the lads (as his gay instincts especially draw him into arousing them at groin level so skillfully by mouth or hand), as he repeatedly finds out to his confused chagrin. Newton's talents as well as his looks, dressed or full-frontally buck-naked, are utterly perfect for the role. As such an erotically mega-charged undergrad college boy, surprised by where his feelings and inclinations, in situations of delicious hilarity, take him, no better casting could be desired! It is very pleasing, as well, that Newton is a native Southerner (in real life hailing from Louisville, Ky.), which helps to make his spoken dialogue to sound so natural in this 2011 film's 1982 Texas setting. And Derek Efrain Villanueva, as Csar, is the perfect foil for Newton, a very different kind of young gay dude, one who is very confident in his homosexuality but is alike of more sleekly delicate physique, and of more innately refined sensibilities, than the taller and varyingly more robust young men in the cast who surround him.

The two protagonists, though so different, were destined for each other! And that is how things turn out, too. This little film is destined for a gay man's utter enjoyment! Although I acquired the DVD only rather recently, I have watched it several times, with ever greater delight.",1396224000,,1933,5.0375
