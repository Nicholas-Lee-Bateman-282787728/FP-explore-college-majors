6426653,4,B00KH53QY0,"Although there are aspects of this film that definitely mark it as a B movie, there is an underlying tone of seriousness and danger.  This may be because it presents a pretty unflinching (for its time) look at the war in Indo-China when the French were fighting the Vietnamese.  This of course was a precursor to the Vietnam War which wasn't exactly World War II either in outcome or a relatively black and white premise.  Fans of war films will enjoy JUMP INTO HELL for what it is--a decent drama with some very good action set pieces.",1451606400,,536,4.505154639175258

6426656,3,B00KH53QY0,Considering this movie was made in the mid-1950s it addresses the battle in a manner that is part documentary and part melodrama.  It appears that there are intercuts of actual battle footage that helps to give some idea of the battle.  Not a great movie but one of the very few that addresses the view from the French soldiers' perspective.,1441670400,2,341,4.666666666666667

6426671,5,B00KH53QY0,"The movie title ""Jump into Hell"" can easily serve as a euphemism for ""Dien Bien Phu - The Actual Beginning of the End of French Colonialism Worldwide."" What the British experienced in India, the French had to learn the even harder and bloodier way: One cannot assume the role of head of household in a home that is not your own and expect to get away with taking everything that is not yours, to put it rather mildly.
The movie is, however, saved by the excellently portrayed heroism and gallantry of the French Armed Forces and their officer corps, including the French Foreign Legion, in this case characterized by the charismatic German-American actor Peter van Eyck. Director David Butler succeeded in ""painting this picture"" with only a small number of brilliant actors, making them stand out as a sterling example of military sacrifice for the ideals of such great French enlightenment philosophers as Voltaire and Rousseau.

6426673,5,B00KH53QY0,"This movie gave a very good portrayal of the people who fought this battle. I did not expect much , but I was really surprised by this movie. I would classify this movie as a sleeper.",1427414400,2,183,4.111111111111111

6426675,5,B00KH53QY0,"I am only going to say that this DVD is worth watching. It's Hollywood's first telling of any story about Vietnam; this being the dramatic defeat of French forces trying to retain their colonial hold on ""French Indo-China"" in 1954. The film was made on the California backlot at Warner Brothers, but had alot of proper equipment used and intercut with newsreel and combat camera coverage of the actual siege of Dien Bein Phu. A few recognizable actirs here and there, and almost EVERY French actor available in Hollywood. ince the Foreign Legion was fighting, we also find heroic Legioneres with American, British, and German backgrounds too. Based on facts less that a year old in 1955, the story is pretty good...some really bad attempts at some humor, and after our own mess in SEA after theis event set us up for our own problems of the 60s and 70s; some of the stuff said then mocks what happened later.  Movie is in B&W to better fit the available combat images. Amazon did the usual perfect job in shipping and handling...with some help by the USPS...let's not forget them!",1419465600,7,1080,4.714285714285714
6426676,5,B00KH53QY0,A classic that brings back very fond memories of my childhood. Saw it for the first time in the 50s..like it than and more now.,1418342400,,127,4.12
6426677,5,B00KH53QY0,EXCELLENT WAR MOVIE,1416096000,,19,5.666666666666667
6426678,5,B00KH53QY0,"This film looks at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, a turning point in France's Indochina War. French Foreign Legionnaires had seized a vital, but remote, area of what would later become North Vietnam and were soon surrounded by Communist-backed Vietminh forces. The story revolves around four French captains who volunteer to parachute into the besieged base and each man's reason for fighting...

This black and white film does not fall for the line that the communists just wanted democracy and independence from France. France was, in fact, in the process of providing self-rule and many of the Vietnamese were fighting alongside the French. Chinese and Russian interference in Indochina was brought to bear in order to put the whole region into the Communist camp.

While the noose around the French defenders gets tighter and tighter and eventually leads to the fall of the fort, the cause of the defenders is just and those of the aggressors... the enslavement of an entire people by the State. But at least when the dust settled Laos and Cambodia would remain free (sort of).

The equipment is almost all U.S., but that is not surprising considering the military assistance provided during and after WWII. However, the rendering of so much of the wording in English (""USSR"" on a Soviet-made revolver and ""French Occupation Forces"" painted on a jeep in Germany)  does kind of distract from the subject matter. Still, try finding an anti-communist movie today and see what kind of luck you have.",1405728000,19,1497,4.976

But he is a big war buff, especially anything about the country of Vietnam --Even when the French were there.",1404086400,,132,4.32
8658674,3,B00KH53QY0,"It is a good story got he most part.....stock shots a little repetitious.  People should remember that the US paid for the war....the locals considered the french another imperialist country...rem the Japanese occupied and brutally suppressed that population in WW2....colonialism was dying and the French wanted to hold on....the British faced up to it several years before.
