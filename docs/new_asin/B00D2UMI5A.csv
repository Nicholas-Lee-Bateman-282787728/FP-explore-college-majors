8588748,5,B00D2UMI5A,"Each of this TIME TEAM digs are a great adventure for even the novice archeologist. I've never viewed a disappointing Time Team show. Educational? Yes, with a team lead by fast-paced and funny Tony Robinson, science is fun. Experts keep the show hopping. Use of geophysics, back hoes, trowel & brush, and even machetes in one location. Fantastic artist renderings help the uneducated-but-interested visualize what the experts see in stones, shards, and coins. The bonus stuff makes this set a total of 11 episodes. More bonus in a viewer's guide. A documentary with the look of prime-time TV.

SUBTITLES provided for each 3-day episode dig.
1- - -Llygadwy, Wales
A roman rich valley with medieval artifacts. Is it a tomb? A hold place? Norman tower? Lots of artifacts from many time periods cause questions of how they got into the site.
2- - -Gatcholm
Welsh coastal island is a challenge for the team to first set foot on. Roman Viking and Celtic are all possibilities. A multi-challenge site; & a typical battle against weather. Is a nearby mainland fort site linked in some way to the island settlement?
3- - -Wierre-Effroy
North France site is an RAF Spitfire crash site of WWII. What archeological war finds can be unearthed? Can one soldier's only day of combat finally be revealed?
1st BONUS- - -Wedmore
TIME TEAM's 1st episode (1994) in Athelney, Somerset farm site promising King Alfred the Great potential. Or is this a just a local farmer tale of the 19th century?

4- - -Turkdean [1997 dig]
Team tackles a Gloucestershire field with lines visible aerially. A suspected Roman villa undiscovered? An interesting Britannia historical look.
2nd BONUS- - -Turkdean Revisited [1998 dig]
18 months later the team retackles the massive roman villa discovered in episode 4. A 1600 year old mystery is underground.
5- - -Breamore
A Saxon grave with a Byzantine bucket draws the team to Hampshire. More grave discoveries and artifact5s excite the dig so much it continues into an extra day 4.
6- - -High Worsall
This Medieval Yorkshire missing village begs the team to answer the who, why, and where of buildings.

7- - -Nevis, West Indies [Part 1]
An island sugar plantation of the Caribbean. It's now jungle, a new difficulty to an archeological dig.
3rd BONUS- - -Nevis, West indies [Part 2]
The second 3-days spent at the plantation and this time centers on the slave quarters search. What might be discovered about slave living? And, a trench opened on the opposite side of the island is bountiful.
8- - -Cirencester
Search for potential Roman Britain archeology like a lost Roman road, temple, and the dream find of the team's 1st roman mosaic floor. Tough digging in walled suburbia backyards.
