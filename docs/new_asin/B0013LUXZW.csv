3118039,5,B0013LUXZW,"I recently purchased a Dogtra remote training collar. A great product, but there is zero instruction included with the collar as far as how to use it for training. It basically just goes over the electronic operation of the product, how to turn it on, how to charge it, etc. The bottom line is, if you buy an e-collar and don't get this DVD, you are a fool. If you are willing to make the major investment in a collar, and don't see the value in purchasing some kind of training for it, I feel sorry for your dog.",1317340800,5,513,4.191919191919192
3118040,5,B0013LUXZW,"I purchased this DVD yesterday through Leerburg.com and I must say that I am highly impressed by the wealth of information that Ed gives you in his video. Before watching this video I saw Robin Macfalane's Just Right DVD and I was not slightly impressed by her teachings. Ed shows much more experience, knowledge, and expertise in dog training and teaches you how to effectively train your dog step-by-step using real dogs in need of training. He explains everything very clearly so that you can take his teachings even further and teach your dog your OWN tricks and desired behavior. This is the only DVD that will fully teach you how to effectively and properly use a remote collar.

A+ product! I highly recommend that everyone watch this DVD before even introducing your dog to a remote collar.",1309910400,21,798,4.782608695652174
3118041,5,B0013LUXZW,"I was very surprised to find this listed on amazon. Amazing how much they have grown. I bought this directly from Leerburg Kennels (the author) and think that every dog owner would learn something from this video. I wrote the longest review on dog collars for amazon (and am not quite done yet) and mentioned that if someone is buying a dog collar they MUST GET THIS.

At the outset I noticed that an individual has rated this as a 1 star in these reviews. Clearly we have to agree to disagree. I volunteer at a shelter and have two rescues and cannot help but wonder if the reviewer isn't misguided in his/her opinions. Our Shepherd-mix is a rescue and we have had her for about 6 years. I had thought of an e-collar because of how aggressive our shepherd is but kept putting it off. I even went as far as getting a crappy collar (still sits in its original packaging) from Petco for some $200 and never used it because of the comments of trainers and folks like the reviewer on here who use the term shock collar in the pejorative.

About a year ago we found a dog that had been left to die in the winter. He is a small fellow (at the time about 19 lbs - all skin and bones when we found him). We knew that we had an uphill battle getting our big dog to get along with the little fellow. Luckily we were able to introduce them gradually (a long story in itself). Given the urgency of what we had on our hands I decided to research e-collars and that was when I ran across this video and the Leerburg kennels website (a great resource).

This video really explains how to go about using this tool, which can be misused through ignorance. Had I not seen this video and decided to just get the Tri-Tronics Pro200 G2 Exp collar I would have misused it. The ultimate goal is for the dog to recognize when you say `No'- you want it to stop what it is doing. I combine this with the `come' command. When the dog comes to me it gets a treat. I ALWAYS carry a pouch with treats and whenever the dogs check-in with me on a walk I give them a treat. The NO command is associated with a shock, WHEN, the Shepherd does not stop what it is doing within HALF A SECOND of me saying NO. I deeply regret not having bought an e-collar and this dvd when we first adopted our Shepherd. She has an amazingly high prey drive (SHE WOULD MAKE AN INCREDIBLE WORKING DOG) and is very very intelligent. Given her incredible focus, without the e-collar, she has hurt my wife, breaking bones, yanking her down a hill etc. At the shelter I see people abandon their dogs, especially powerful breeds, because they simply cannot handle them. E-collars are a tool to prevent things from getting to this stage and this video shows you how to use them. If you are reading this I suspect you need help with your dog. Most people don't have aggressive dogs but have opinions on how to train them! People that THINK they know how to train a dog with a high prey drive should meet a K-9 and then they might see the value of an e-collar. Most importantly, if you are thinking of getting rid of your dog, PLEASE WATCH THIS AND TRY AN E-COLLAR.",1300924800,61,3102,4.254237288135593
3118042,5,B0013LUXZW,"I would highly recommend this video. I feel from personal experience that you have to be shown how to correctly use a remote collar/electric collar for it to be effective.  I have found all of Leerburg's videos to be very helpful, informative, and helps to prevent you from making common mistakes. I believe this video is a ""must watch"" before you start using your electric collar. I believe you cannot buy an e-collar and just start zapping away.  You have to learn how to introduce the collar to not condition the dog to the collar, how to properly fit the collar, how long it can be left on the dog for, why you use the collar, and the proper methods and timing for giving the ""nick"" (the correction).  If you do not properly introduce the collar, the dog will be conditioned to the collar, meanining the dog knows the stim is coming from the collar and will be inclined to obey only when the collar is on.  If the dog is properly introduced to the collar, then they do not know the stim comes from the collar and they think it comes from YOU.  This means the dog will be inclined to always listen becuase they believe you can give them the ""nick"" at any time.",1299110400,4,1163,4.3657407407407405
3118043,5,B0013LUXZW,"This is a great DVD, it shows how to correctly use a remote collar and also shows that this type of training puts less stress on the dog than using a choke collar.  I have seen people at local obedience classes dragging their dogs around with a choke collar and giving them leash corrections and they don't seem to achieve the level of traing desired after even 8 weeks.  With this DVD you can see how effective and humane this type of training can be. I have always been against shock collars but I have a GSD with a high prey drive and turned to a shock collar after trying many obedience classes and other training DVDs.  After watching this DVD, it has changed my opinion and would definately recommend it over dragging your dog around with a choke collar, which can cause damage to the dog over time.  Also, to comment on the other review, Ed's dogs did not appear fearful of him at all.",1260230400,21,892,4.355421686746988
3118044,1,B0013LUXZW,"I have a waterdog who I have trained for four years, and am considering using an e-collar to condition an aversion to chasing wild prey.  I bought the Leerburg ""Remote Collar Training for the Pet Owner"" to see how he does it, as some of the things he recommends (but doesn't do) are to use a remote collar only in advanced training, not as negative reinforcement (where dog learns to shut it off), but as a punisher when dog fails to perform a learned behavior. That's what he says by way of introduction, then he pulls some untrained puppies out of his kennel and starts testing the shock collar out on them, zapping and releasing when they glance at him.

When the dogs are showing signs of stress, Frawley is saying that he sees absolutely no reaction. When the stress is such that the dogs start displaying avoidance behaviors, Frawley explains how he is working with the dogs below their level of avoidance. Best to turn the sound off as you view this, so you can come to your own conclusions about what you are seeing.

I'm sure Ed Frawley is a very nice guy who knows lots about dogs, but he himself seems to avoid noticing that the dogs become fearful of him. He says the dogs are looking at the ground because they think the shock is coming from the ground, when really the dogs are displaying submissive, appeasing gestures, trying to turn away from his fight.  It looks incredibly obvious as the dogs start to guess exactly where the pain is coming from, they know it has to do with this interaction with Ed Frawley, and they try various ways to appease him, including turning away, sitting and making eye contact, while he brushes that off because he is testing to see if he is hurting them enough.

Listen to Ed's breathing. It's not just the dogs who are stressing here. It must be a bit scary to have a big german shepherd pup on a six foot leash and do some test zaps. He seems to get nervous as he administers each shock, because he can see at some level that the dog is suspicious and mistrustful, and I bet sometimes, with some dogs, if you stand there and look at them and pet and zap , some dogs might react aggressively.

I am not a close minded collar hater.  But, if you think he's a great trainer, you really need to study with more trainers. There are great trainers out there, and they could tell Ed that if you don't want dogs to start displaying avoidance behaviors, don't use a shock collar! The only time to use a shock collar is when you DO want to train the dog to avoid something, and ideally you don't want the dog to be trying to  avoid YOU! When Ed pets the dogs after shocking them, cooing nice words, it apparently reassures him that the dogs don't overtly hate him, but I see the dogs get the same expression on their face that I remember my siblings having on their faces when they got icky kisses from my Great Aunt Ann. The dogs evidently dislike their interaction with Ed. I see no love in their faces.  It looks sort of like what happens when you bring your dog to the veterinarian for vaccinations. They flinch, they don't like it, and in the future, they hide from the vet and don't want to visit the vet.

That's not what you want to happen in dog training.",1252195200,22,3205,4.353433835845896

3118050,2,B0013LUXZW,"There are some useful pieces of information, however the format is hard to follow. The DVD starts with Ed Frawley discussing his view of the e-collar. I think that understanding his philosophy is important, however 10 well thought out minutes would be sufficient. Instead, he starts with his philosophy, shows you a couple of dogs, gets back on the porch, then begins to discuss his philosophy, most of which can be found on his website. The video is 2 hours and 45 minutes, however there is no more than 35 minutes of good information. It feels a lot like watching an absent minded professor. I think that Ed Frawley is an extremely competent dog trainer; it just is not really conveyed in this video.

Gave it a 4 instead of a five because I felt the instructions could have been much shorter and to the point. I want to spend time training and playing with my dog not playing a DVD.

But a very good video. I do recommend it. And recommend using an E -Collar for certain types training.
But Please PLEASE get some instruction like this video before you strap on an e collar on your dog.
  Its more then just shocking a dog.

One thing I'd like to add. A dog owner should frequently change between the remote collar and other regular collars throughout the day so the dog dose not get collar smart. Meaning the dog will only listen when it knows it has the e -collar on. How often? As often as possible.",1386028800,2,774,4.238095238095238
3118053,5,B0013LUXZW,"A DVD presentation that outlines the steps to using an e-collar as a tool for training a dog. Be careful that you do not assume you know more than a veteran  handler of 'hard dogs' used in police work. Accept the DVD for what it is. It was prepared in the past, but the basic information presented is far more detailed and accurate than most folks know. Those who are on a par with Ed Frawley are professional handlers and that is not the market for these videos.

An e-collar can be used in different ways and it is up to you to study on it. Whatever happens to your dog is your responsibility. Get a knowledgeable trainer locally and look at YouTube videos if you like free help (some is good quality and some is not). But regardless of the production quality of the video, the value lies in the content and skill of the trainer who is the presenter.

As a serious rescue volunteer and amateur trainer fo a long while, I believe that this DVD is a valuable tool to get understanding of terms, technique, and reasons for using an electronic collar. To gain an understanding that a modern e-collar with 3 buttons ( 'nick', 'continuous' and 'page' ) rather than an old fashioned type almost makes this DVD worth the cost. Ask 100 people what a photo of an e-collar is and they will reply ""I don't know"" or ""'a shock collar"". This DVD can help you quickly understand what an e-collar is for and how to employ it. And the presentation can help open your eyes to why an e-collar is NOT inhumane and is far less damaging to a dog than a choke chain or even flat collar yank on the dog's neck.

Dog rescue volunteers can gain a lot of useful information in this DVD. Those who have not spent a year or more doing dog rescue (and seeing the inside of shelters and the unfortunate dogs abandoned there) can stay quiet and follow the professional caliber advice and instruction of Ed Frawley or his associates like Michael Ellis.",1384732800,2,1920,4.384831460674158
3118054,5,B0013LUXZW,"This is a fantastic training DVD for those interested in electronic collar use with your dog. Electronic collars are mostly used for hunting dogs when you need to correct your dog off the leash and at a distance. But if you have a stubborn dog, this is for you too. I had excellent results with this method for my new  two year old beagle. She no longer needs the collar unless we are afield, and even then she does not need much correction. If the electronic collar is not for you, this guy has another DVD on obedience training using dog treats that may be more your style.",1383955200,,575,4.324074074074074
3118055,1,B0013LUXZW,"There are two philosophy's about ecollar training. The first is that you give them a ""nick"" that supposed to be like a jerk on the collar. The other is that you hold the button down until the dog complies, ultimately the dog learns that she is in control of turning the irritation off. I think both can be useful. This DVD subscribes only to the first. He does describe the second though. Frankly, I couldn't get through the tape. He includes an old video of a dog being ""trained"", I say tortured, with an ecollar when they first came out. I still can't get the image out of my mind. I don't know why he did that. My girl is very sensitive. I bought an ecollar with vibrate, nick and constant on it. The collar I bought has 127 levels, I set ours on 11. I have used the sustained 1 time, every other time I have used the vibrate. I am thrilled with our results so far.

3118057,5,B0013LUXZW,"My German Shepherd was totally out of control. She was so protective of me, that she would show her aggressiveness by jumping and barking ferociously at any one (except family) that came to the door.  So I desperately needed help to get this type of behavior stopped. My daughter told me about purchasing an e-collar.  She and her husband used one to retrain her dogs and got great results.  So I researched and researched for the right e-collar. With her help, she and I agreed on the one I have.  My son in law and daughter came over the day I received it in the mail, and took control of showing me how to put the collar on her and of course how to use the transmitter. She became the ""trainer"" for the first session. Within 5 minutes, my dog was reacting to the ""Come"" command, and would go directly to my daughter. My dog already knew the sit and stay command.  So after commanding my dog to ""come"" she also told her to ""sit"" and ""stay"". My daughter showed me how to do this all in one smooth session.  We let my dog roam through the house as she always does for about 15 minutes. Then my daughter told my dog to ""Come"" and she came immediately to my daughter, sat down without being told.  What a miracle!! It was so great to see that only after 5-7 minutes, and only being ""zapped"" once, she was responding quickly and without hesitation. I still use the collar every day and have NOT had to ""zap"" her but once in the 3 months that she started wearing the e-collar.  If you are having a rough time with a disobedient dog, you HAVE to get the e-collar and the DVD (look at it again and again, because each time you will find something new that you didn't quite hear the first time)  and most of all follow Ed's instructions.  He is a great trainer!!! I can't thank him enough for having these DVDs and his care for training dogs in the way they should be trained.

I like the positive reinforcement approach (clicker/marker training), but I don't believe that it has to be used exclusively as some purists propose. On the other hand i also think that indiscriminate use of remote collars without thinking through the approach, can be harmful to a sensitive dog's drive. Nobody walks through the application of each method as thoroughly and comprehensively as the folks at Leerburg while leaving plenty of room for the pet owner to draw their own conclusions from the imparted knowledge and choose thei  own approach.",1363564800,,676,5.1454545454545455

3118068,1,B0013LUXZW,"This DVD is outdated. People looking to train dogs with an ecollar should instead spend their money on Michael Ellis' e-collar training series, check out YouTube videos of Bart Bellon, or look into how bird dog and hunting dog trainers use the e-collar. All of these trainers utilize a different method of training with the e-collar than is shown in this DVD. The e-collar training protocol set forth in this DVD is unfair and confusing to the dog.

There are two ways to train with the e-collar. One is to use the e-collar as a correction- to ""shock"" the dog when he doesn't obey or does something wrong. For example, dog gets into the trash, you catch him in the act, and give him a shock with the e-collar. If you are lucky, the dog will associate getting in the trash with a shock and won't get in the trash anymore. Problem with this is that the dog may instead associate the shock with being in the kitchen, or walking on tile. Then you have a dog with superstitious behavior that could result in potential issues for a working dog.  In some cases, a one time shock can be very effective in eliminating an unwanted behavior, but most of the time it takes more than once. Another once common use of the e-collar was to correct hounds or bird dogs for chasing ""trash"" (unwanted wildlife like deer). This involves really nailing a dog when he is chasing deer and never allowing hiim to practice the behavior. Again, this may or may not be effective, especially if you can't see the dog.

The other way to train with the e-collar is to start at a very low setting- the lowest settng the dog can feel (generally around 15- 25 on a Dogtra collar)- and teach the dog that complying with commands turns off the discomfort. This is called ""avoidance"" or ""escape"" training. Originally, I thought Frawley's method was more fair. I actually used his methods on my first dog to stop him from chasing cattle. It worked for that particular dog. I tried the same thing with my current dogs and they had no idea what was going on- yelped- and continued with the bad behavior (in this case, chasing deer). I re-evaluated and did a lot of research. I now firmly believe that it is much more fair and clear to a dog to teach using avoidance training than to break out the collar and correct the dog for not complying.

I do not believe Frawley currently trains his dogs in the way he shows in the video. Frawley is a huge Michael Ellis fan and promoter and trains competition malinois with Ellis. Michael Ellis uses escape training with the e-collar. So, basically, Leerburg should have discontinued this video a long time ago, but, because there are so few videos out there on e-collar training and because Leerburg is generally respected in dog training circles, this DVD continues to be a money-maker for Leerburg. Be aware that the method of training in this video is no longer used by Ed Frawley himself. Time to update this video and discontinue the current DVDs production.

To continue with description of escape training- by teaching the dog that she has control over the stimulation, you set her up to succeed. There are various ways to condition the dog to the e-collar, but most trainers recommend teaching three major commands first- the ""come"" or recall, a distance ""sit"" or send out to ""place"" and ""heel"". As the dog becomes proficient with the collar, proof distractions. I really like this method of training because the level of shock is very low. Like most caring dog owners, I was hesitant about shocking my dogs. But I needed to do something to keep them from chasing wildlife and still allow them to be off leash. E-collar training is also useful for a dog-reactive dog. I do not correct the dog for misbehaving- that is a huge mistake. But when I ask my dog to ""come"" and then ""heel"" in order to pass another off-leash dog, my dog can't also react at the same time she is following my commands. Thus, slowly, her reactivity is simply disappearing. She is finding out that she doesn't need to show that other dog that she is dominant to avoid an interaction. If she sticks with me and follows my commands, the other dog won't bother her. She is happy, confident, and simply loves to work. All the clicker-treat training in the world wasn't going to get us to this point off leash.

I don't want you to make my mistake and waste money on this DVD. Please look into escape training instead. Lou Castles website has great step by step instructions that even a complete novice can use. For me, that free resource was significantly more instructive than the Leerburg DVD.",1349740800,110,4574,4.571951219512195

I have a ""hard"" dog to train. She is a Pit mix and is dog to dog agressive. This video made me realize that with proper training, she could be persuaded to change her behavior. Her brother, the opposite, is the typical terrific dog. He minds well except...he will not stop jumping on people and on the couch! I am certain that after a few, if only one, training session, this will stop. I believe that using the techniques learned in this video, I can have the sort of dog most people think they can't have. They will be disciplined and fun loving. Leerburg knows his stuff and is not one of those ego filled trainers. He seems like a nice guy that really loves dogs. I'll write back after the training and hopefully send a video.",1336348800,,1047,4.346938775510204

Before watching this video I saw Robin Macfalane's Just Right DVD and I was not slightly impressed by her teachings. Ed shows much more experience, knowledge, and expertise in dog training and teaches you how to effectively train your dog step-by-step using real dogs in need of training. He explains everything very clearly so that you can take his teachings even further and teach your dog your OWN tricks and desired behavior. This is the only DVD that will fully teach you how to effectively and properly use a remote collar.

A+ product! I highly recommend that everyone watch this DVD before even introducing your dog to a remote collar.",1309910400,21,798,4.782608695652174
3352538,5,B0013LUXZW,"I was very surprised to find this listed on amazon. Amazing how much they have grown. I bought this directly from Leerburg Kennels (the author) and think that every dog owner would learn something from this video. I wrote the longest review on dog collars for amazon (and am not quite done yet) and mentioned that if someone is buying a dog collar they MUST GET THIS.

At the outset I noticed that an individual has rated this as a 1 star in these reviews. Clearly we have to agree to disagree. I volunteer at a shelter and have two rescues and cannot help but wonder if the reviewer isn't misguided in his/her opinions. Our Shepherd-mix is a rescue and we have had her for about 6 years. I had thought of an e-collar because of how aggressive our shepherd is but kept putting it off. I even went as far as getting a crappy collar (still sits in its original packaging) from Petco for some $200 and never used it because of the comments of trainers and folks like the reviewer on here who use the term shock collar in the pejorative.

About a year ago we found a dog that had been left to die in the winter. He is a small fellow (at the time about 19 lbs - all skin and bones when we found him). We knew that we had an uphill battle getting our big dog to get along with the little fellow. Luckily we were able to introduce them gradually (a long story in itself). Given the urgency of what we had on our hands I decided to research e-collars and that was when I ran across this video and the Leerburg kennels website (a great resource).

This video really explains how to go about using this tool, which can be misused through ignorance. Had I not seen this video and decided to just get the Tri-Tronics Pro200 G2 Exp collar I would have misused it. The ultimate goal is for the dog to recognize when you say `No'- you want it to stop what it is doing. I combine this with the `come' command. When the dog comes to me it gets a treat. I ALWAYS carry a pouch with treats and whenever the dogs check-in with me on a walk I give them a treat. The NO command is associated with a shock, WHEN, the Shepherd does not stop what it is doing within HALF A SECOND of me saying NO. I deeply regret not having bought an e-collar and this dvd when we first adopted our Shepherd. She has an amazingly high prey drive (SHE WOULD MAKE AN INCREDIBLE WORKING DOG) and is very very intelligent. Given her incredible focus, without the e-collar, she has hurt my wife, breaking bones, yanking her down a hill etc. At the shelter I see people abandon their dogs, especially powerful breeds, because they simply cannot handle them. E-collars are a tool to prevent things from getting to this stage and this video shows you how to use them. If you are reading this I suspect you need help with your dog. Most people don't have aggressive dogs but have opinions on how to train them! People that THINK they know how to train a dog with a high prey drive should meet a K-9 and then they might see the value of an e-collar. Most importantly, if you are thinking of getting rid of your dog, PLEASE WATCH THIS AND TRY AN E-COLLAR.",1300924800,61,3102,4.254237288135593
3352539,5,B0013LUXZW,"I would highly recommend this video. I feel from personal experience that you have to be shown how to correctly use a remote collar/electric collar for it to be effective.  I have found all of Leerburg's videos to be very helpful, informative, and helps to prevent you from making common mistakes. I believe this video is a ""must watch"" before you start using your electric collar. I believe you cannot buy an e-collar and just start zapping away.  You have to learn how to introduce the collar to not condition the dog to the collar, how to properly fit the collar, how long it can be left on the dog for, why you use the collar, and the proper methods and timing for giving the ""nick"" (the correction).  If you do not properly introduce the collar, the dog will be conditioned to the collar, meanining the dog knows the stim is coming from the collar and will be inclined to obey only when the collar is on.  If the dog is properly introduced to the collar, then they do not know the stim comes from the collar and they think it comes from YOU.  This means the dog will be inclined to always listen becuase they believe you can give them the ""nick"" at any time.",1299110400,4,1163,4.3657407407407405
3352540,5,B0013LUXZW,"This is a great DVD, it shows how to correctly use a remote collar and also shows that this type of training puts less stress on the dog than using a choke collar.  I have seen people at local obedience classes dragging their dogs around with a choke collar and giving them leash corrections and they don't seem to achieve the level of traing desired after even 8 weeks.  With this DVD you can see how effective and humane this type of training can be. I have always been against shock collars but I have a GSD with a high prey drive and turned to a shock collar after trying many obedience classes and other training DVDs.  After watching this DVD, it has changed my opinion and would definately recommend it over dragging your dog around with a choke collar, which can cause damage to the dog over time.  Also, to comment on the other review, Ed's dogs did not appear fearful of him at all.",1260230400,21,892,4.355421686746988
3352541,1,B0013LUXZW,"I have a waterdog who I have trained for four years, and am considering using an e-collar to condition an aversion to chasing wild prey.  I bought the Leerburg ""Remote Collar Training for the Pet Owner"" to see how he does it, as some of the things he recommends (but doesn't do) are to use a remote collar only in advanced training, not as negative reinforcement (where dog learns to shut it off), but as a punisher when dog fails to perform a learned behavior. That's what he says by way of introduction, then he pulls some untrained puppies out of his kennel and starts testing the shock collar out on them, zapping and releasing when they glance at him.

When the dogs are showing signs of stress, Frawley is saying that he sees absolutely no reaction. When the stress is such that the dogs start displaying avoidance behaviors, Frawley explains how he is working with the dogs below their level of avoidance. Best to turn the sound off as you view this, so you can come to your own conclusions about what you are seeing.

I'm sure Ed Frawley is a very nice guy who knows lots about dogs, but he himself seems to avoid noticing that the dogs become fearful of him. He says the dogs are looking at the ground because they think the shock is coming from the ground, when really the dogs are displaying submissive, appeasing gestures, trying to turn away from his fight.  It looks incredibly obvious as the dogs start to guess exactly where the pain is coming from, they know it has to do with this interaction with Ed Frawley, and they try various ways to appease him, including turning away, sitting and making eye contact, while he brushes that off because he is testing to see if he is hurting them enough.

Listen to Ed's breathing. It's not just the dogs who are stressing here. It must be a bit scary to have a big german shepherd pup on a six foot leash and do some test zaps. He seems to get nervous as he administers each shock, because he can see at some level that the dog is suspicious and mistrustful, and I bet sometimes, with some dogs, if you stand there and look at them and pet and zap , some dogs might react aggressively.

I am not a close minded collar hater.  But, if you think he's a great trainer, you really need to study with more trainers. There are great trainers out there, and they could tell Ed that if you don't want dogs to start displaying avoidance behaviors, don't use a shock collar! The only time to use a shock collar is when you DO want to train the dog to avoid something, and ideally you don't want the dog to be trying to  avoid YOU! When Ed pets the dogs after shocking them, cooing nice words, it apparently reassures him that the dogs don't overtly hate him, but I see the dogs get the same expression on their face that I remember my siblings having on their faces when they got icky kisses from my Great Aunt Ann. The dogs evidently dislike their interaction with Ed. I see no love in their faces.  It looks sort of like what happens when you bring your dog to the veterinarian for vaccinations. They flinch, they don't like it, and in the future, they hide from the vet and don't want to visit the vet.

That's not what you want to happen in dog training.",1252195200,22,3205,4.353433835845896

3352550,5,B0013LUXZW,"A DVD presentation that outlines the steps to using an e-collar as a tool for training a dog. Be careful that you do not assume you know more than a veteran  handler of 'hard dogs' used in police work. Accept the DVD for what it is. It was prepared in the past, but the basic information presented is far more detailed and accurate than most folks know. Those who are on a par with Ed Frawley are professional handlers and that is not the market for these videos.

An e-collar can be used in different ways and it is up to you to study on it. Whatever happens to your dog is your responsibility. Get a knowledgeable trainer locally and look at YouTube videos if you like free help (some is good quality and some is not). But regardless of the production quality of the video, the value lies in the content and skill of the trainer who is the presenter.

As a serious rescue volunteer and amateur trainer fo a long while, I believe that this DVD is a valuable tool to get understanding of terms, technique, and reasons for using an electronic collar. To gain an understanding that a modern e-collar with 3 buttons ( 'nick', 'continuous' and 'page' ) rather than an old fashioned type almost makes this DVD worth the cost. Ask 100 people what a photo of an e-collar is and they will reply ""I don't know"" or ""'a shock collar"". This DVD can help you quickly understand what an e-collar is for and how to employ it. And the presentation can help open your eyes to why an e-collar is NOT inhumane and is far less damaging to a dog than a choke chain or even flat collar yank on the dog's neck.

Dog rescue volunteers can gain a lot of useful information in this DVD. Those who have not spent a year or more doing dog rescue (and seeing the inside of shelters and the unfortunate dogs abandoned there) can stay quiet and follow the professional caliber advice and instruction of Ed Frawley or his associates like Michael Ellis.",1384732800,2,1920,4.384831460674158

This DVD subscribes only to the first. He does describe the second though. Frankly, I couldn't get through the tape. He includes an old video of a dog being ""trained"", I say tortured, with an ecollar when they first came out. I still can't get the image out of my mind. I don't know why he did that.

She was so protective of me, that she would show her aggressiveness by jumping and barking ferociously at any one (except family) that came to the door.  So I desperately needed help to get this type of behavior stopped. My daughter told me about purchasing an e-collar.  She and her husband used one to retrain her dogs and got great results.  So I researched and researched for the right e-collar. With her help, she and I agreed on the one I have.  My son in law and daughter came over the day I received it in the mail, and took control of showing me how to put the collar on her and of course how to use the transmitter. She became the ""trainer"" for the first session. Within 5 minutes, my dog was reacting to the ""Come"" command, and would go directly to my daughter. My dog already knew the sit and stay command.  So after commanding my dog to ""come"" she also told her to ""sit"" and ""stay"". My daughter showed me how to do this all in one smooth session.  We let my dog roam through the house as she always does for about 15 minutes. Then my daughter told my dog to ""Come"" and she came immediately to my daughter, sat down without being told.  What a miracle!! It was so great to see that only after 5-7 minutes, and only being ""zapped"" once, she was responding quickly and without hesitation. I still use the collar every day and have NOT had to ""zap"" her but once in the 3 months that she started wearing the e-collar.  If you are having a rough time with a disobedient dog, you HAVE to get the e-collar and the DVD (look at it again and again, because each time you will find something new that you didn't quite hear the first time)  and most of all follow Ed's instructions.

3352565,1,B0013LUXZW,"This DVD is outdated. People looking to train dogs with an ecollar should instead spend their money on Michael Ellis' e-collar training series, check out YouTube videos of Bart Bellon, or look into how bird dog and hunting dog trainers use the e-collar. All of these trainers utilize a different method of training with the e-collar than is shown in this DVD. The e-collar training protocol set forth in this DVD is unfair and confusing to the dog.

There are two ways to train with the e-collar. One is to use the e-collar as a correction- to ""shock"" the dog when he doesn't obey or does something wrong. For example, dog gets into the trash, you catch him in the act, and give him a shock with the e-collar. If you are lucky, the dog will associate getting in the trash with a shock and won't get in the trash anymore. Problem with this is that the dog may instead associate the shock with being in the kitchen, or walking on tile. Then you have a dog with superstitious behavior that could result in potential issues for a working dog.  In some cases, a one time shock can be very effective in eliminating an unwanted behavior, but most of the time it takes more than once. Another once common use of the e-collar was to correct hounds or bird dogs for chasing ""trash"" (unwanted wildlife like deer). This involves really nailing a dog when he is chasing deer and never allowing hiim to practice the behavior. Again, this may or may not be effective, especially if you can't see the dog.

The other way to train with the e-collar is to start at a very low setting- the lowest settng the dog can feel (generally around 15- 25 on a Dogtra collar)- and teach the dog that complying with commands turns off the discomfort. This is called ""avoidance"" or ""escape"" training. Originally, I thought Frawley's method was more fair. I actually used his methods on my first dog to stop him from chasing cattle. It worked for that particular dog. I tried the same thing with my current dogs and they had no idea what was going on- yelped- and continued with the bad behavior (in this case, chasing deer). I re-evaluated and did a lot of research. I now firmly believe that it is much more fair and clear to a dog to teach using avoidance training than to break out the collar and correct the dog for not complying.

I do not believe Frawley currently trains his dogs in the way he shows in the video. Frawley is a huge Michael Ellis fan and promoter and trains competition malinois with Ellis. Michael Ellis uses escape training with the e-collar. So, basically, Leerburg should have discontinued this video a long time ago, but, because there are so few videos out there on e-collar training and because Leerburg is generally respected in dog training circles, this DVD continues to be a money-maker for Leerburg. Be aware that the method of training in this video is no longer used by Ed Frawley himself. Time to update this video and discontinue the current DVDs production.

To continue with description of escape training- by teaching the dog that she has control over the stimulation, you set her up to succeed. There are various ways to condition the dog to the e-collar, but most trainers recommend teaching three major commands first- the ""come"" or recall, a distance ""sit"" or send out to ""place"" and ""heel"". As the dog becomes proficient with the collar, proof distractions. I really like this method of training because the level of shock is very low. Like most caring dog owners, I was hesitant about shocking my dogs. But I needed to do something to keep them from chasing wildlife and still allow them to be off leash. E-collar training is also useful for a dog-reactive dog. I do not correct the dog for misbehaving- that is a huge mistake. But when I ask my dog to ""come"" and then ""heel"" in order to pass another off-leash dog, my dog can't also react at the same time she is following my commands. Thus, slowly, her reactivity is simply disappearing. She is finding out that she doesn't need to show that other dog that she is dominant to avoid an interaction. If she sticks with me and follows my commands, the other dog won't bother her. She is happy, confident, and simply loves to work. All the clicker-treat training in the world wasn't going to get us to this point off leash.

I don't want you to make my mistake and waste money on this DVD. Please look into escape training instead. Lou Castles website has great step by step instructions that even a complete novice can use.

3352567,3,B0013LUXZW,"Mr.  Frawley is an amazing trainer,  but like everything we evolve,  we must keep our tools sharp,  I am sure he is a magnificent trainer,  but the presentation is just not engaging to the viewer,  granted in commencing of the video he does apologize for using the word shock,  as i viewed the video I quickly realized it was a hodge podge of many videos collected over time,  as to see why the term will contradict itself (shock vs. stim)  no big deal...  I do appreciate the fact that he uses fresh dogs,  not dogs who have been fully trained so you can appreciate the process,  and the man is a marketing genius,  I don't mind if he plugs his website every now and again,  but man he did it on every single item he pulled out.  It was between this video and Robin Mac Farlanes,  I went with the experience,  but I just ordered Robins videos and will post a review on her material,  I must add there was a section in the video at an attempt at humor,  it broke the monotony a little,  staged or not cant tell for sure...  hope this helps,  he does give some good advice,  but even some of the reference he makes towards his collar is outdated,  so you cant really connect the dots,  and he mentions dogtra did not want to be a part of this video at the start of the video,  that was my redflag...  once again from what I have heard and listened he is an amazing dog trainer,  video instructor you be the judge...",1344297600,,1414,4.194756554307116
3352568,5,B0013LUXZW,"I listened to this DVD and felt like I had invested in a class. This was far better than the 100$ puppy training I got at a local store. Even though this is not a trining video, I learned so very much from it. The explanations are exceptional, the use of different dogs and their different personalities was helpful. I have a ""hard"" dog to train. She is a Pit mix and is dog to dog agressive. This video made me realize that with proper training, she could be persuaded to change her behavior. Her brother, the opposite, is the typical terrific dog. He minds well except...he will not stop jumping on people and on the couch! I am certain that after a few, if only one, training session, this will stop. I believe that using the techniques learned in this video, I can have the sort of dog most people think they can't have. They will be disciplined and fun loving. Leerburg knows his stuff and is not one of those ego filled trainers. He seems like a nice guy that really loves dogs. I'll write back after the training and hopefully send a video.",1336348800,,1047,4.346938775510204
3352569,1,B0013LUXZW,"Ed means well, but he just cant seem to get it together enough to put out a DVD that is good training.  This DVD is terrible instruction.  The e-collar is a great tool when used correctly, unfortunately Ed does not use it correctly.",1328659200,6,232,4.372093023255814
3352570,3,B0013LUXZW,"I bought this DVD, I actually work for an Electric Collar Company and like to see what others
say about their use. I was not impressed. This DVD didn't give really any good ""how to"" info.
But it does give better info then any DVD that actual e-collar companies give with their products.
From someone who uses an electric collar from hunting dogs, to house pets, and rescue dogs that
are wild and never had any training...e-collars are easy to use. I use e-collars daily and wish there was
a good, ""hands on"" DVD for folks available.",1326931200,4,532,4.494845360824742
