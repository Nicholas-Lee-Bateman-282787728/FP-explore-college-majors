3486979,4,B001B94K3W,"i enjoyed this film.  even though one of the lead characters dies early in the film, you still have enough other characters to carry on, and give you a film worth watching",1290124800,,171,4.34375
3486980,3,B001B94K3W,"I thought this was the least interesting and involving of Fernan Oztepek's films so far, certainly a much lesser work than Steam and Facing Windows.  The film conveys an undoubtedly important message about the importance of extended families in gay male lives.  However, I felt the film aimed to be such a gay/liberal crowd-pleaser that it failed to push any buttons or raise any real questions about family, friendships, or sexual identities and/or relationships.
It's not visually arresting or interesting either, despite being beautifully shot, with plenty of male eye candy (but no nudity, if you were looking for that).  Also, despite the best efforts of a very good cast, I didn't find any of the characters well developed and particularly believable.  They all felt like ""types"" (the loving gay couple, the older gay guy, the cheating husband, the professional woman, the troubled beauty, etc.) who didn't really interact as friends would, but more like idealized versions of how we wish friends would be like.
Despite all the shots of teary eyes and melodramatic moments aimed at making you cry, this film left me cold in most scenes.  It's a pleasing, well-meaning film, but it's far from being great cinema, and it's much less interesting and engaging than Oztepek's earlier, far superior films.",1271635200,4,1305,5.107981220657277

3486982,5,B001B94K3W,"I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that Ferzan &Ouml;zpetek is the most gifted filmmaker in the world today, and Saturn in Opposition is his best film so far. I've watched it at least a dozen times, and it still reveals some new delight to me each time. It's a treasure, a work of such astonishing beauty on so many levels, so deeply satisfying and so thoroughly entertaining, that I'm reluctant to write about it for fear I won't do it justice.

I can't think of any way anything about this movie could be improved. It has raised the bar so high I can't see past it. The brilliant screenplay, the flawless performance by every person in the cast, the breathtaking cinematography that caresses everything the camera sees, the music that never intrudes but always enriches and deepens the story, the surprising flashes of wry humor in what is a very serious and touching work, the marvelous way Lorenzo's inner monologue wraps itself lovingly around the whole film--just the way this movie FEELS, the indescribable way it makes ME feel when I'm watching it, or just remembering it--everything about Saturn in Opposition is simply perfect.

The only movies I can even compare it to are others by &Ouml;zpetec himself:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/His-Secret-Life/dp/B00008ZZ8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">His Secret Life</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Facing-Windows/dp/B0002XNSYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Facing Windows</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacred-Heart/dp/B000N1CWUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacred Heart</a>. Each of those movies is a treasure in itself, better than anything else out there, but while each one of them shares many of Saturn in Opposition's remarkable achievements, none of them quite reaches its level of perfection. Every scene, every frame, every sound, every second of its 105 minutes is just The Best. The best it could be, and the best there is, anywhere.

I know I've been gushing, I know I've violated another reviewer's injunction against ""aggrandizing"" this movie, but I'm only telling the truth about my experience of it as clearly and as honestly as I can. If anybody else likes it a fraction as much as I do, I'll celebrate that with them. If not, I can't help but love it anyway.",1237507200,10,2367,5.795977011494253
3486983,5,B001B94K3W,"Ferzan Ozpetek understands as well as any writer/director today the concept and attending importance of Extended Family.  Much as he spoke about the importance of friends who are often more supportive than genetic family in his beautiful film HIS SECRET LIFE, he explores a similar topic in his latest exceptional film SATURNO CONTRO (SATURN IN OPPOSITION).  Ozpetek and his co-writer Gianni Romoli have created a story about camaraderie, celebration, shared loss, consolation, and healing among a rather disparate group of Romans that manages to not only underscore our human needs, but also demonstrates how nearly insurmountable hurdles can be managed by the kindness and understanding of true friends.

Davide (Pierfrancesco Favino) is a much admired writer who lives with his artist partner  Lorenzo (Luca Argentero) in a healthy, loving relationship. Davide has many admirers who wish to fall under his influence as a writer and Lorenzo likewise has many friends who are devoted to him. These friends gather at the home of  Davide and Lorenzo for meals, parties and celebrations - a place where each of the friends finds compassion for whatever is nibbling away at their happiness.  Davide's close friend Antonio (Stefano Accorsi) is married to the beautiful Angelica (Margherita Buy) who is writing a book about smoking and is not aware that her husband is having an affair with florist Laura (Isabella Ferrari) until a mutual friend, translator Neval (Serra Yilmaz) - caring for both friends' concerns - shares the information.  The possible disastrous discovery is overshadowed by the sudden subarachnoid hemorrhage suffered by Lorenzo during a communal meal.  Each of the friends' lives are halted while they gather at the hospital awaiting the inevitable death of their friend - each with open arms of support for Davide and each other as they find their way through dealing with the circle of life.  The story places Lorenzo's tragedy near the beginning of the film: the resolution and coping of the large number of this extended family form the message and the sidebars that explore the sanctity of friendship and caring. There are myriad moments of rare beauty in this little film, moments that include the tenderness of Lorenzo's father's acceptance of Davide's relationship to his son as the funeral is passing, the wordless mending that the death of a friend brings to the dissolving marriage of Angelica and Antonio, and many others.

This is a beautifully photographed film (Gian Filippo Corticelli) and one with a musical score (Giovanni Pellino 'Neffa') that is so subtle that it supports without distraction (much like the presence of Extended Families!).  The acting is of the highest quality from some of Italy's finest actors.  We can only hope that Ferzan Ozpetek continues to create meaningful films such as this for a world that too often settles for finding solace as well as  happiness from artificial sources outside the circle of human relationships.  In Italian with subtitles.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 08",1224460800,11,3055,5.216768916155419
3486984,5,B001B94K3W,"This delicate, moving and absorbing film continues director Ferzan
Ozpetek's growth as a great film artist. His movie STEAM possessed a
sweet sensuality that was potent and moving. His movie HIS SECRET LIFE
is a sexy little masterpiece. It is moving and funny. And, like I said,
very sexy.

With SATURN IN OPPOSITION, Ozpetek teams up again with the gorgeous
Italian actor Stefano Accorsi. This actor added sensuality to every
scene in HIS SECRET LIFE. Stefano continues to bring his amazing heat
to SATURN IN OPPOSITION.

This movie is an ensemble piece in every sense of the word. A group of friends are thrown into turmoil when the most beloved member of their group is struck down in his prime. How the friends and lovers and former lovers survive this tragedy is heartwarming and very moving.

If this movie does not get to you then you have no heart. Period.",1222300800,64,864,4.746666666666667
3486985,2,B001B94K3W,"Let's not aggrandize this film; there is not a lot of substance going on here.  A sad and youthful death, yes (why do all the pretty ones have to go first?)----and grieving and loss.  But there's little to create an emotional attachment to these characters......even prior to the death.

This production is NOT a ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steam-The-Turkish-Bath/dp/B00004UEEB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steam: The Turkish Bath</a>"" in that regard, or even an ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/His-Secret-Life/dp/B00008ZZ8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">His Secret Life</a>,"" both of which got us more ""involved.""  To this viewer, the most interesting point was before film's end, in the denoument between widower, Davide, and a come-to-acceptance and grieving, deceased's father.

At film's conclusion, there is a tying-up........a coming to terms.  I wonder, though, is real life ever as smooth as pictured?

PS--Points for beautiful, beautiful photography work (are this man's films ever not?)

3486993,5,B001B94K3W,"Ozpetek yet again proved that he makes very good cinema. ""Il bagno turco"" then ""Le fate ignoranti"" and ""Mine vaganti"" - each of them shows that one doesn't need milions to make something to remember.
Although ""Saturn in opposition"" story is focused on a group of friends and relations between them, it's the gay couple that remains centre of all events.
Not intending to give away the plot, I will just write that you won't feel bored.
Acting is really superb. There are not paper-thin characters here. Ozpetek shows life the way it is. Such story could happen everywhere. In Rome, Barcelona or Warsaw. And the truth is very simple: we all need friends, even if sometimes they are pain in the neck :)

3486994,2,B001B94K3W,"What was a promising, enjoyable and at times even funny, turned typical formula gay movie.  We have a bunch of friends who are both gay and straight who for the most part get along while dealing with the ups and downs of life including cheating husbands. Half way through the movie, the the cutest, central gay character had a stroke in his late 20's, early thirties and spends the second half of the movie dying, which he finally does. Then we fear for a part of the film ending for the anticipated suicide of the surviving partner, which almost happens but doesn't. The film closed on a game of ping pong. What is it with film studios and their scripted screenplays where at least one of the main gay characters has to have a tragic ending? This guy not only suffers in a comma, but dies leaving behind grieving friends and family. Can't we turn out movies now a days where all the gay characters have happy lives or at least lives that don't end by the end of the movie? This crap has been going on since the 1950's and it's time to change the formula!",1329696000,5,1055,4.355329949238579

8282321,5,B001B94K3W,One of the best foreign independent films every made.  First saw it in Europe and was delighted to see that it was finally available in Region 1 DVD format.  The musical sound track is also noteworthy and for anyone not familiar with the Italian musical/singer Neffa you should definitely check out his albums.

8282322,4,B001B94K3W,"Saturno Contro (2007) is an drama in a Italian directed by Ferzan Oezpetek. Though I am a huge fan of his work--especially Le Fate Ignoranti (2001) & Mine Vaganti (2010)--this film is not his best. There is a 30-45 minute stretch in the last half of the movie really seems to drag on. The last 10 minutes are breathtakingly poignant, though. Overall, a recommended film for those who enjoy Oezpetek's work or queer cinema.",1404518400,,422,4.716216216216216
