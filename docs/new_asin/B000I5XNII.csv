2653161,1,B000I5XNII,Wish I had known that it was a region 2 dvd (meaning that you can't use it in the USA and Canada). I can not watch it now.,1431561600,,122,3.392857142857143
2653162,5,B000I5XNII,This is a terrific British comedy series that I saw years ago.  It was just as funny and quirky these many years later.,1425168000,,119,4.173913043478261
2653163,3,B000I5XNII,"I really love this old movie, and was disappointed when none of my friends, or my DVD players, or computers would play it.  My brother went out and bought a DVD player that would play all international movies of this type.  I finally got to see this wonderful old film, but needed the additional $30.00 investment to make it happen.  The film itself is as good as I remembered!",1424044800,,377,4.434782608695652
2653164,4,B000I5XNII,"I did not read carefully before ordering and therefore I had return it because I do not have the equipment to play the DVD. It requires a UK Region 2 DVD Player. I can make a recommendation because I have seen this movie more than once. It is hilarious and anything that stars Alisair Sim is well be worth seeing, but you must have the right equipment.",1417478400,,352,4.268656716417911
2653165,5,B000I5XNII,"This four DVD set covers the original St Trinian's movies,  which bring to life the Ronald Searle cartoons set in a fictional British girl's school (Think Charles Addams ghoulishness).  As the headmistress says in the first film, other schools educate young girls, then turn them loose into a harsh world.  When it a St Trinian's girls graduates, it is the world which has to watch out.  Generally, the older girls are unscrupulous, but tend to rely on guile and sex appeal, while the younger fourth form girls rely on numbers and hockey or lacrosse sticks.  The films are all comedic caper plots with a good deal of slapstick.  Three of the four are black and white.  A fifth film, Wildcats of St Trinians, is not included in the set and is not up to the level of the other films.
I also like this original series better than the two recent films reviving the series.",1393113600,9,868,4.561290322580645
2653166,5,B000I5XNII,"This set is an excellent package of the first 4 St. Trinian's films and each is a delight especially With Sim as Miss Fritton. Picture quality is excellent. Ignore the one-star reviews. These are by idiots who don't have region-free DVD players and give a bad review to a product because of their failings, not the DVD's. Do yourself a favor. Look up region-free DVD players on Amazon and get one. Same price as any other, they're just reprogrammed. Now I get DVDs from all over the world including Downton Abbey months before they're available here.",1386115200,8,550,4.739583333333333
2653167,1,B000I5XNII,I had to return this item because it was not identified as Region 2. I would love to own it in Region 1 format.,1359244800,2,111,3.6666666666666665
2653168,5,B000I5XNII,"I think the other reviewer's bad experience is because of his dvd player rather than the dvd set. Between myself and several others, I don't know anyone who has experienced the problems he described. When asking around about this one of my friends who knows a lot about the technical aspect of this stuff said such problems are probably the result of having a dvd player which is not PAL compatible because those sort of playback problems would happen if trying to watch PAL format video on a NTSC format U.S. tv. But if you have a dvd player which is both NTSC and PAL compatible then the player will automatically convert the European PAL format to NTSC before sending it to your tv so it will display properly. So the moral of this story is if you are going to buy this wonderful dvd set or others from anywhere else in the world which uses the PAL format, make sure you have a dvd player which has PAL compatability before ordering.

If you like classic movies from the fifties then you should love this set. I'd say the original 3 from the 1950s are the best. And it seems to be those are the ones often called ""classics"" by most people. Keep in mind these are in black and white so if a film must be in color to keep your interest then they may not be for you. The fourth film (from the sixties) is in color but it's just not up to par with the first 3, which are joyously funny. I've heard many people refer to them as hilarious, extremely funny, a hoot, etc.  If you enjoy timeless humor then I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1337299200,17,1538,4.3
2653169,1,B000I5XNII,"What can I say other than I got two copies of this set & found both were faulty. The typical problems were jumping, pixilation & lock ups. Both copies. I tried to inform the manufacturer Cannal & I am still waiting for a reply. E-mails & faxes are ignored. It appears that their corporate world view is that any complaint is to be ignored. The movies are from poor quality film & not even the master. Substandard product from a substandard company. What more can I say.",1330387200,4,469,4.402298850574713
8144014,4,B000I5XNII,"Enjoyable bunch of films.  Not hilarious, but still good.  George Cole as Flash Harry is terrific.  Those who downgrade their ratings because the collection is Region 2 are idiots who can't read.",1522886400,,195,5.03125
8144015,1,B000I5XNII,I wish I could watch them they do not work on my Blueray at all,1510790400,,63,3.2666666666666666
8144016,5,B000I5XNII,This box set is the key to a complete St Trinians collection for me. And I was far from disappointed these films have been fully restored and the picture quality is first class. The item arrived a week later then stated but It arrived in perfect condition. And I had no trouble playing it on my multi region DVD player. One of my best ever buys.,1509235200,,345,4.242424242424242
8144017,4,B000I5XNII,"It says on the box and on each disk that its Universal play... NOPE.... its not. Thats the only reason im not giving this 5 stars. I have a multi player so take this into account before you buy.
Lovely to see these old films.
Good quality  disc .....for the age off the films BTW",1503273600,,279,4.072727272727272
8144018,5,B000I5XNII,will not play on my dvd player but will work on my computer so it is all cool,1485302400,,77,3.3333333333333335
8144019,5,B000I5XNII,"The four St. Trinian's movies in this set are the holy grail of all of the St. Trinian's titled movies produced. All are from the writing/ directing production team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilleat; each one is a satirical masterpiece shown through the lens of the students of St. Trinian's School For Young Ladies. Whether you are a fan of British comedy, a devotee of the films Launder and Gilleat, a Ronald Searle fan or just someone who enjoys movies that are slightly off beat, you will enjoy these films.

These movies have been around for decades and much has been written about them so if you aren't familiar with either the films themselves or the Ronald Searle cartoon series that inspired them, go to Google and you will find out more than I can tell you about the films and the cartoons that preceded them; then come back here and order them, you won't be disappointed.

Unlike many of the individual St. Trinian's titles available, these are high quality discs from Studio Canal which holds the world wide distribution rights to the films, This is a region 2 set so if you are buying this in the United States, you need a region free dvd/ blu ray player.",1484611200,3,1170,4.566666666666666
8144020,5,B000I5XNII,My husband has been looking for these editions quite a while now.  They are as funny and quirky as ever glad to have found them,1473552000,,127,4.08
