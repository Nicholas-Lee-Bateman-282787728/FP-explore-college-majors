3161811,5,B0016N99MK,"Let me start by saying that I do not personally know Gabe or have been trained by him. But own and have read all his books. All of which are our very good but due to the vast amount of material available on the subject he covers some material covered in other titles (which is not always a bad thing). But as far as his Kalashnikov Gunfighting series he breaks new ground on this weapon platform that is loved and hated (by the uninformed and uneducated). A few weeks ago I bought Gabe's book ""Kalashnikov Rifle Gunfighting"" (read my Amazon review). I used this book to help develop a training regime in Afghanistan for Afghani troops and praised this book in my review. I learned a lot of information from it and decided to buy the DVD. The DVD is fantastic, clear and concise plus with Gabe's personality and professionalism displayed on film compounded with his demonstrated capabilities I knew he was guy I would go through the door with. For all you gunslingers you this is a bold statement and I stand by it. The DVD covers most of the topics in the book plus a lot more and clarifies some points made in the book. Here is how the DVD is structured and chaptered;

- Introduction
- Ammunition and Magazines
- The AK Control System
- Stocks for The AK
- AK Conditions of Readiness
- Loading and Unloading The AK
- Gun Safety
- Use of The Sling
- Zeroing The AK
- AK Optics
- Assembly and Disassembly
- Ready and Carry Positions
- Snap Shooting
- Close-Quarters Shooting
- Ambidextrous Use of the AK
- The Rifle in Movement
- Reloading The AK
- After-Action Assessment
- Reactive Manipulation
- CQB Displacements
- Firing with the Stock Folded
- Using Cover
- Taking Corners
- Weapon Retention
- The AK as Impact Weapon
- Shooting at Intermediate Distances

I recommend that both DVD and book be bought together. They are stand alone items but I feel the professional will get it hammered home using both. Just remember to forget everything you know about operating the AR/M4 platform and you will learn and enjoy this instruction for what it is; to learn how to operate the AK (not AR) in combat conditions. Gabe has started something here that it seems all are trying to copy to make a quick buck and that is the difference between Gabe's products and training. He loves the weapon system whereas other schools (of thought) are rounding out their curriculum to make more money on the new fade. Fortunately this is not a fade to Gabe but a way of life. I think Gabe will be known as the AK godfather of gunfighting. Bottom-line if you run an AK-series system get this DVD. I already ordered the new DVD ""Advanced Kalashnikov Rifle Gunfighting,"" which I will also review.",1224201600,12,2675,4.490759753593429

8263453,1,B0016N99MK,I am giving kalashnikov rifle gunfighting one star. I am a veteran former US Army paratrooper / SOF. I thought I could learn something new but that is not the case. I do not agree on some of the training on this DVD. On the other hand this DVD has good for someone who is not familiar with the AK47/74 weapon system.,1477958400,,316,4.112903225806452
8263454,4,B0016N99MK,I like the author like Kalashnikov's and shoot them quite often. I found it to be a good review of the rifle and certainly have learned some things new.  That makes it worth the price itself.,1429228800,,191,4.305555555555555
8263455,5,B0016N99MK,"You may not like Gabe Suarez but he does have some pretty decent informational videos and books on the market for weapons and self-defense training.

If you own an AK-platform rifle, this is a good reference DVD to have in your library.",1393372800,,236,4.619047619047619
8263456,4,B0016N99MK,"We would have preferred this in book form, but the DVD worked out ok.  Watched it right away and learned a few new things.",1361750400,,122,4.083333333333333
8263457,4,B0016N99MK,"I enjoyed the Video, it ran a little to long for me 45 minutes was all I needed. It is a basic training film for persons in close combat situations.

I have not bought the weapon they presented as today. But take a second look about purchasing one.",1357430400,,248,4.166666666666667
8263458,5,B0016N99MK,"Recently I purchased an AKMS Polish underfolder after carefully researching the AK- Variants.  I was sold on the AK for it's strength,  reliability and  fire power.  I was not at all familiar with this type of Rife other then what it said in the Owner's Manual and what I had learned on line.. I really didn't  know how to use it or train with it other then just shoot it after sighting it in with the AK Sight tool.
I had seen this Video on One Source Tactical and wanted to get it.. I found it on Amazon cheaper!
 Gabriel Suarez is an Outstanding well known Instructor on  Small Arms Tactical Combat etc.. Here he embraces the AK-47 Rife Platform and shows how to execute some Tactical Methods using the AK-47. In Essence it is basic fundamentals you will need to know about operating this Rifle effectively.. There is another more advanced Video after this one I Plan to get sometime in the Future.. (Still too Simple to be Tactical) I am only seeing that Video on One Source Tactical though.. Also, the (TIB) Terrorist Intercept Bag used in the Video, I have only seen at One Source Tactical. Amazon has some decent Bags, but not seeing the TIB
  I Really like the way Suarez presents the Training and certainly learned  things I did not know! One thing I was a little surprised he did not touch on was the different types of Muzzle Brakes.. Slant vs Cage etc. How they affect control of the rife including  Flash surpression.. Still an Excellent Video! Nicely recorded.. Perhaps you might find it interesting also and useful if not entertaining... I plan to buy more Suarez Training Videos in the Future.",1342310400,,1609,4.552083333333333
8263459,4,B0016N99MK,"With all of the modern rifle training focusing on the AR15/M4 type rifle it is nice to see someone look at at the most prolifict rifle in the world and how to maximize its potential.  This DVD is not as in depth as the Magpul series but gives you a good working knowledge of how to use the AK series of rifle. And while a little more focus on optics would be nice it is still a very well done DVD. Just make sure that if you try these techniques out that you start off with dry practice. Then when you are confident that you have them down you can try them with live ammo at half speed. Once that is comfortable,consistent and accurate then you can go all high speed low drag.  And while the DVD is good no DVD can make up for hands on training. So take a class from Gabe or some other school and train hands on. These DVDs just supplement what formal training gives you.",1330560000,2,871,4.087719298245614
8263460,5,B0016N99MK,"Gabe's teaching style is straightforward, realistic, thoughtful, well-organized, and pleasant. This DVD is a coherent, studied treatment of the AK.

I also own the Magpul Dynamics tactical carbine series-- which is oriented to the AR.

It's useful to view both, and then pick/choose/synthesize a method that works for you-- especially if you own both platforms.",1326585600,,361,5.545454545454546
8263461,5,B0016N99MK,"I had seen clips from this video on youtube and wasn't sure the video would really be that helpful, but the rest of the video was a lot more useful than those clips.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending this.",1305244800,,205,4.394736842105263
8263462,5,B0016N99MK,This DVD is well done with all basic information presented. It lives up to it's title.,1234396800,,86,4.4375
