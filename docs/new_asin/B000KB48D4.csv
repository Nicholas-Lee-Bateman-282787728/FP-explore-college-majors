The only English is when Leti is in school in Chicago, where the teachers and most of her classmates spoke English.  [Also, the grandfather said a few words in English, once.  It didn't seem to fit, so my guess is that the script was in Spanish, but he forgot and said the line in English.]

While the story is about children left with their grandparents while their parents worked as illegal immigrants in Chicago, I think the real story is about how the grandmother discriminated against Leti because she was dark complected, while most of the grandchildren had inherited the grandmother's more light complexion (and even blond hair).  This is a wonderful story of a grandfather who made a special effort to nurture Leti, not protecting her from his wife's blatant dislike of her, but showing her positive ways to cope.  He is a very loving grandfather - actually, father figure - to Leti.

Most of the movie deals with the kid's daily lives, so there isn't a lot of drama.  However, when the inevitable death comes to the Grandfather, it brings about an unexpected positive change in Leti's situation.  Another minor dramatic incident that traditional values, religious families will appreciate occurs when Leti seems to be lost.  The blond sister, who had taunted Leti, tattled on her and was constantly getting her in trouble, prayed openly for forgiveness and asked God to bring Leti back.  It is obvious that she meant it, too, because after that she and Leti behaved more as friends.

It is true that the acting and production qualities may not be up to the best of Hollywood.  But, this is a wonderful movie showing the lives of children left behind by illegal immigrants to the U.S.  It is a heartwarming story well worth watching.

[One caveat - the older children - young adults - do occasionally use coarse language.]",1242777600,,1979,4.725947521865889
8155347,5,B000KB48D4,"This film opened my eyes to the plight of the children of immigrants. I didn't realize that many children were abondaned with relatives when their parents leave for the US. As an educator, I recommend this wonderful, thought- provoking  movie to anyone that truly wants to understand the many faces and costs of immigration. I applaud those responsible for shedding light on the untold story of the children of immigrants.",1202342400,,422,5.0285714285714285
8155348,4,B000KB48D4,"This movie details the richness in the Mexican people. The fact that migration provokes separation among families but it cannot crack in the relationship between grandparents, parents, and siblings.

This movie shows how grandparents transfer their ideas, language, beliefs, etc. from one generation to the next.

Esta pelicula rescata la riqueza cultural Mexicana. El hecho de que la migracion provoca que la relacin entre generaciones, entre abuelos, padres e hijos, se fragmente pero que no logra truncar la transferencia de ideas, reflexiones, lenguaje, valores, etc.,de una generacion a otra en definitiva, el legado que se transmite de forma dinmica entre generaciones, se ve claramente plasmado en esta pelicula.

El legado, afortunadamente, no es algo que se determina, que se especifica, no es un testamento que pueda dejarse escrito, sino que es el conjunto de ideas, valores, detalles, concepciones, experiencias, etc. que heredamos cada uno de nosotros.",1179619200,,965,5.595890410958904
