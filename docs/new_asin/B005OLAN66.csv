8481564,3,B005OLAN66,It's obvious this was made to be thought of as real. However if you like the playboy fantasy of Hefner's life. I reccomend it. It is nice addition to the rest of the reality T.V. shows that are in the genre of GND etc.. However even though it's made up drama it was entertaining and gret for a playboy collector.,1389916800,7,312,4.216666666666667
