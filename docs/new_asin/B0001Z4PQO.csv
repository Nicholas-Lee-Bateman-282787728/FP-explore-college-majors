8018589,4,B0001Z4PQO,"The ending was such a knockover that I kept the disc and watched the whole film again the next day.

What a beautiful, if sad story!",1368576000,,132,4.076923076923077
8018590,4,B0001Z4PQO,"I found the film Lea disturbing. A modern day peasant girl in an Eastern European country witnesses the brutal treatment and eventually murder of her mother by her father (stepfather?). A couple in the village takes her in and sells her to a cruel German for a princely sum of money (by their standards) to be his wife. He is 30 years older than her and his treatment of her is very similar to what her mother put up with. Also, she is a gifted writer and also a artist. Maybe she developed this talent because the trauma she endured made her unable to speak easily.

It might be because I'm American I can't see how the two develop a love for each other as time goes on. I could never truly forgive the man even if he did slowly change.",1153958400,5,737,4.226950354609929
8018591,5,B0001Z4PQO,"This film has an outer and an inner side, like most good films. On the outer side, an antique restorer from Germany marries a 30 year younger Slovak girl (after 'purchasing' her from her forster parents). The film shows the development of their difficult relationship.

On the inner side, this is a film about healing traumatic experiences from the past,

and it is deeply moving.

As for the DVD: The transfer could be better (grainy TV quality). The film languages are German and Cech, and the english subtitles can't be turned off.",1138752000,8,534,4.782608695652174
