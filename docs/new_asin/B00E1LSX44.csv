5884417,5,B00E1LSX44,"I have been eagerly awaiting this show. I love pirates, I always have. There was a rather large drought in anything pirate related after Cutthroat Island bombed at the box office in the `90's. We didn't get any more pirate films until the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and they got a bit carried away with the supernatural element, in my opinion. There is no magic or supernatural element in this show, it doesn't need it.

The pilot starts with an epic naval battle that rivals anything I've ever seen on film, and we quickly get introduced to Captain Flint and his crew and their current plight, a mere 20 years before Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island takes place. This show has a big budget and production value, the set and costume designs are great, the digital effects are very well done. This is STARZ biggest show for sure, and I think it'll make some sizable waves for the station. The finale was brilliant. There were great call backs to things that happened in the first 2 episodes (which is when I truly realized how brilliant the arc of the entire first season is), and the show takes a very unpredictable and unexpected turn in the few final scenes of the finale. I am very excited for what season 2 has in store for John Silver, Captain Flint and his crew, as well as other characters like Charles Vane and Ms. Guthrie. Characters like Jack Rackham and Gates and Billy Bones ended up being far more important and entertaining than I originally thought. This is an ensemble show, it takes a few episodes to realize it but characters I originally underestimated or pegged as throw away characters ended up shaping a lot of major events in season 1.

Anyone who has played UBISOFT's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, will feel like they are watching that game come to life. This show lives and breathes pirate, there is plenty of rum drinking, mutiny aboard Flint's ship, female nudity at the brothel in Nassau (from the gorgeous Jessica Parker Kennedy), sword fighting and naval battles. This show encompasses everything you want out of a pirate themed show or film. What is to become of Captain Flint and his crew as they set sail to locate and board a Spanish Galleon said to be carrying 5 million in Spanish gold? This and HBO's True Detective are the best new shows of 2014, Black Sails comes FULLY APPROVED.",1389830400,155,2337,4.642512077294686
5884458,4,B00E1LSX44,"Black Sails is a fantastic bit of historical fiction about colonial piracy. It launched around the same time that Assassins Creed: Black Flag was new (and very popular), and though I caught a few episodes back then I had to start at Season 1 to get my sea legs back.

Whats great about this show is writing and direction of the storyline working towards a broader conflict. Season 1 is pretty upfront about the fact that a pirates life is, well you know: nasty, brutish, and short. The sailors pillage merchants then blow all their money at a pirate-friendly port until they're broke and they have to go hunting again. Captain Flint is too smart for that kind of piracy, though hes not too smart to avoid the murderous brutality of sea-crime. It takes a few episodes to get to know him, and all we know in the beginning is he is quite talented and lucky (good feats for a scoundrel). By the finale, we realize two more things about Flint: he will never reconcile with the crown, and he is not a good guy at ALL. Flint is downright vindictive and evil, but he happens to have a goal thats patriotic, admirable, and revolutionary. While Flint is a devil of a captain, the rest of the characters are so twisted by their demons theres nothing but shreds of humanity left. Charles Vane is an excellent example of this, and while he is made out to be a brutish man in the beginning, by the end, he proves himself among the most heroic barbarians (like literally war paint, earth, and beast-mode), performing epic feats against all the odds. There are of course many wicked scoundrels in Nassau, some historical, some fictional, all plundering in different capacities, and all trapped by greed and circumstance.

The reality of Black Sails very much subjugates women to the role of scandalous with some exception. Eleanor proves herself a competent administrator in Season 1 as does Max wise counsel to Jack Rackham. Anne Bonney is indeed a sea scoundrel and proves at least as cutthroat as the devil himself. One way in which the show hedges its seriousness is by including lots of graphic depictions of the carousing going on, especially prostitution. I don't want to say that its okay, but at least it reflects the reality of what brigands experienced concerning comfort. Furthermore, the show tackles things like sexism and rape in Season 1 authentically, and Id expect to see similar issues in the future seasons. The same is true for Mr. Scott, a slave, and the role of slaves in the show. In a sense, all of the pirates are bound to their way of life, a way of life that a slave would charge into certain pistol shot just for a chance at freedom. Im impressed with this reflective quality of Black Sails and know that the content is genuinely offensive because it is a part of reality.

Aside from the authenticity of the show, the acting is fantastic. Particularly, Miranda Barlow (Flints common-law wife), and Long John Silver, set-piece characters in Season 1 who are always negotiating their circumstances with charm and guile. The effects are fantastic, and the Caribbean is a bright canvas to host sweat, shot, blood, and gold. At night, the cool humid air provides a frame for wispy candle smoke, lurid men, and gorged women to ease their minds. The music and intro sequence is impressive and energizing, perfect for the tale of intrigue, savagery, and chaos that is Black Sails. Should the story end now, I think I would be happy to see Flint dead, but being that its not (and its not my neck out), I think Id very much like to see him come to his end.",1524873600,,3560,4.62085308056872

5884465,4,B00E1LSX44,"Movie fans are familiar with the genre of the ""Psychological Western,"" but the Psychological Pirate Adventure never gained traction -- perhaps by popular demand?  This action-packed pastiche of real historical events and people peppered with fictional ones delivers thanks to great actors and what must have been a wildly expensive commitment to ship and battle scenes.  I'm amazed that this went to four seasons, not because it didn't deserve to, but because historical dramas far less costly than this have been cut off at the knees in fewer seasons.  Toby Stephens provides maximum eye candy for the entire audience, along with the typical improbably gorgeous cast, and you're going to need that distraction.  Because by the end, if you see the actors settling in for one more extended dialogue on the nature of their relationship, the nature of politics, the world, or history in the making, you are going to be hitting that fast-forward button with all the vengeance of Capt. Flint on his pistol trigger.  Even so, it did keep me subscribed to Starz far past my intended sign-off date.",1518307200,,1090,5.0

5884467,3,B00E1LSX44,"Black Sails is so much like other shows in recent years- it's 30% good and about 70% annoying. I thought Toby Stephens turned Captain Flint into a very intriguing character, who was only referenced in Treasure Island as the captain who had the treasure. He was a rare character that seemed to really become something special. Captain Flint, who wasn't really known in pirate lore, all of a sudden becomes one of the greatest pirate depictions of all time. He's depicted as a real-life pirate, somebody that is believable, which we haven't really seen in cinema before. They did color his character with some surprises, but it wasn't overly done and it didn't really become some propaganda issue. With that said, I found a lot of the plot wasted on annoying side stories that could of had potential, but were basically ruined by the usual Hollywood agenda- porn and the inevitable social justice themes. I would like to give the series 5 stars for Toby Stephen's Captain Flint, but I would also like to give it 2 stars for all the excessive Hollywood 'in your face' propaganda, which really got in the way of an intriguing story. I would encourage people to watch it, if nothing else, to see Captain Flint's depiction.",1517097600,,1217,4.745283018867925

In my opinion the loud background music (NOISE) is indicative of lousy writing.  If the writing is good no one needs to be told when to get excited.  One of the reasons ""The Sopranos"" was so gripping was the lack of a score, no competition with actors delivering dialog.  You could actually hear every word without straining.  The practice of injecting these loud scores into what otherwise might be decent productions is a another product of the Hollywood small minds schooling like fish.  When will they learn there is no substitute for good writing.  And if they think their writing is good, then fine, let's HEAR IT!

5884496,5,B00E1LSX44,"A doomed pirate ship holds a key to great wealth. When a critical page of the captain's log is torn from the book in the chaos of battle by an unscrupulous cook, it becomes a hot item. The cook is murdered for the prize by an unassuming man named John Silver who convinces the boarding party that it is he who is ship's cook and finagles his way into the crew. His new mates are led by Captain Flint, a man who promises his men an equal cut of their plunders. However, small scores and relative failure have turned many away from him and closer to his rival, the devious Singleton who has the votes to oust the skipper. Flint's right-hand man, Quartermaster Gates, works to re-secure the captain's stature with his men and peg Singleton as the traitor who stole the page from the log book. He does so with the support of a key crew member, Billy Bones. The crew lands at Nassau where they must deal with Eleanor Guthrie who has followed in her father's footsteps as Nassau's go-to businessperson intermediary. Meanwhile, Silver, who still holds the page, strikes up an unorthodox and unwanted alliance with a local prostitute named Max who knows his secret. At the same time, a rival captain named Charles Vane hopes to secure the log book page for his own needs, chiefly to discover the whereabouts of the legendary treasure ship Urca de Lima.

Black Sails opens by setting its bar so high that it never quite manages to again top it. A stellar ship-versus-ship attack serves to not only introduce some key characters and story dynamics but to also demonstrate the show's technical marvels in one of the most explosive, immersive, and detailed high seas battles ever to grace the screen, small or large. It's an epic open that will certainly draw its viewers closer but threatens to alienate them at the same time when it becomes apparent that the show is, mostly, landlocked rather than sprawling out on the high seas. That said, the show is a carefully constructed character study that, while detailed, still feels a bit empty and hollow. It embraces the same sort of conniving and complicated plot matters that are the hallmark of all of these historically inspired modern drama television epics, going full-bore for the seedy underside of an already dangerous world. The characters are mostly type with a few surprises thrown in here and there. Most viewers with a general knowledge of the pirate genre (and a reading of Treasure Island under their belts; the show is a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's literary classic) and the way modern television works won't find very much new here beyond the impressive outward dressing.

As alluded to above, what's really missing is a sense of adventure. Black Sails isn't so much about pilfering and plundering or exploring strange new worlds along the high seas but instead about the politics, the backstabbing, the manipulation, the real grit and dirt that takes place on land rather than on the sea. In that sense, it's less a pure adventure show and more a stationary drama, a strange choice for a program built around a concept that, in popular culture, generally involves more seafaring adventure and less land-loving wheeling and dealing. It's more interested in being a deeper, more complex character drama and less about floating along the ocean and both seeking out treasure and encountering unwanted dangers. Much of that, likely, stems from cost; were every episode crammed with big, wide open adventure to new places and big vessel-on-vessel action to match, the program would likely buckle under the weight of its pricey demands. Setting it primarily on land and centering it fully on characters rather than mixing in sweeping adventure allows the show to stretch further while standing relatively still.",1503273600,,3768,4.867601246105919

5884553,3,B00E1LSX44,"Season 1 of Black Sails is good but a little slow for my tastes. This prequel to Treasure Island drags alot, so much so that it feels like it's doing it because Starz didn't have the budget to make the show have spectacle. Instead, you get the somewhat interesting daily life of pirates, filled with debates about a lost treasure and science about the act of sailing. Some of these parts are interesting because the series is capturing a realism to pirate life that is rarely showcased on film/tv. The characters are also a saving grace, as this show captures really unique dynamics between characters that are every shade of grey imaginable. The acting is spectacular as is the cinematography and the visual effects.

So, while the season can be a bit of a slog it is incredibly worth watching because the plot lines that form in Season 1 lead into Season 2 - a season that truly establishes the show as one of the best to come out in the last decade.

Camera shots noticeably lingering on the naked breasts of women for more than a couple seconds adds nothing to the storyline.

Also the behavior and appearance of some of the characters seems unrealistic. The women are all clean and beautiful. A lot of the men also. The cast of Disney's pirate movies look more believable. The language is a bit over the top too. I'm sure there were plenty of pirates that swore but the F word every other word at times is too much and unrealistic for this time period.

5884581,1,B00E1LSX44,This series has a very disjointed story line with threads that don't seem to go anywhere or are improbable.  It seems more of a vehicle for nudity and violent scenes than a coherent telling of the tales of real pirates in the 1700's.  $25 wasted,1490659200,,245,4.4222222222222225

5884586,4,B00E1LSX44,Toby Stephens role alone would dictate a 5-star review.  However the script deprives Mr. Stephens stellar performance and gives all too much emphasis on lesser aspects of the show.  Mr. Luke Arnold's role as young John Silver has also develops with excellence.  Lots of very favorable twists and turns in the plot.  However the script/production has dealt the show's Female leads with altogether too much repetition.  Black Sails would benefit greatly with just a tad more quality of work in the editing room.,1488499200,2,509,5.0843373493975905

5884665,1,B00E1LSX44,"The thechnical quality of the series is excellent, the storyline is above average, but like so many of the products in the entertainment industry, the sexual content is pointless unless you have an LGBT agenda - since almost every main character is bisexual or gay.  It's as though we're to believe that nearly 100% of the lives the series highlights with any detail seeks to uncover an open sexual orientation... by season two.  Such a shallow view of humanity lack any real attempt to think beyond the maker's obvious hang up.  I stopped watching the oversexed and short-sighted  show after the main character was revealed to be hiding his preference for his man-love  relationship.  This is becoming way to cliche.

I bought my copies (two of them so far) from Best Buy, and have been experiencing issues with playback, which is why I've gone through two copies so far. The first time, on disc one, the playback started skipping/freezing during the scene with the appraiser and the two paintings. I tried the disc in two different DVD players, and experienced the same result.

And just today, I experienced the exact same skipping/freezing during the playback of the scene where Captain Vane is explaining to the prostitute that some people love you, some hate you, etc... the DVD playback just starts skipping and freezing. The thing is, that when it happened the FIRST time, I took the first DVD set back to Best Buy for a return, and replaced it with a new one. And now, I get the same problems with an entirely different and new DVD set???

Was there like an entire damaged shipment of DVD sets or something? Both discs didn't have a speck of dust, let alone any scratches on them... why does this happen? Has anyone else experienced this problem? All I want to do, is enjoy the show! I don't want to have to keep returning DVD sets! PLEASE HELP!",1485475200,,1254,4.443478260869565

5884911,2,B00E1LSX44,"It's a shame that what could have been an interesting and fascinating story about a violent and colorful time in history instead is a foul-mouthed soap opera. Yes, today, to be 'successful' as a series, there needs to be lots of violence, sex, and speech using the 'f' word three or four times in a sentence. Black Sails outdoes itself in all three. The violence is graphic (normal these days), and the sex scenes 'shocking'---holy Moses, woman did THAT to each other in the early 18th Century??  The writers obviously think that having Elanor use the 'f' word in just about every sentence makes her look tough and (?) sexy.  It also covers their lack of language skills and vocabulary.  They appear ignorant of the fact that the word didn't actually come into common use in English-speaking peoples until the early 1800s---a hundred years after Elanor (and every one else in Black Sails) use it repeatedly.  This ain't no Treasure Island!  And, it becomes just plain boring after 2 or 3 episodes. Not worth watching another season.",1481414400,,1032,4.807909604519774

Excellent writing, characters that act the same way thruout the series. Oh sure, alliances change, deals get made, but the character who thinks one way, will always think that way. This show is so superior to ""the walking dead"", it makes my soul weep to think ""Black Sails"" only gets four seasons and TWD get 7 so far....

The scenery is beautiful, the writing is top notch, the writers can't get enough credit. The psychology of all the characters is a beautiful thing to see and it translates superbly to film from the script.

The show begins about twenty years before the events of ""Treasure Island"" during the golden years of piracy around 1715. The show is a dramatic recreation of the time with excellent acting and writing that intertwines the various factions and individuals coexisting in the port town of Nassau.

sunscreen disappears and melts.

I be out ta sea, watching seals,
paying bills, whilst mate's practice cartwheels.

Laying back, rum in hand,
peppered by turtle soup mixed with sand,
such a tempting memory, mixed with thyme,
slurped... savored, my life's divine.

Captured French Cookie, knows her stuff,
and she fluffs
me feathers, while cocked hat shades
me, sharpening blades.

Spyglass reaches out oceans blue,
business at hand, coming into view.
Ready mates? Light the fuse.
Cannon #1... Fire, then reuse!
Blast those bastards to smithereens,
then feed Queen's men to the sardines.

Ports of Rum Tavern pleasures,
winches tops overflowing measured,
me mates gold teeth glow
in skirts, at the Skull and Bones Bordello.

5885120,2,B00E1LSX44,"Very disappointing.  I am a great fan of all things related to Pirates--histories, novels, movies, and even the language.  The actors are capable, but for a few exceptions, not overly compelling.  Except for the opening sequence, it took FIVE shows just to get onto a boat!  And, as an obvious gesture to attract more viewers, there are more women than ever depicted in a pirate's story, with power, influence, good teeth, fine dress--you know, all the things that make no sense, based on the genre.  The dress of men and women alike is too clean, too studio-designed, and as such, makes this look like a cheap made-for-TV production, as opposed to a great theatrical epic.  The language makes no pretentions to even sounding a little like the pirates of old--modern English, with modern profanity (the ""f"" word throughout, again inconsistent with the times).  Unbelievable storyline, absurd assumptions, slow and generally witless dialog makes this for an unfortunate waste of talent, and sets (limited as they were, with most water scenes CG at its cheapest).  If you like PIRATES, there isn't much here to stimulate your interests--even Depps's P of C series is better than this attempt.  This kind of reminded me of Game of Thrones, without the story, without the charisma, and without the believability--just an echo of the pathos.",1473724800,2,1336,5.036363636363636

Also appreciated that the character development of Flint, Eleanor, Gates, Mrs. Barlowe, Long John, etc. were given top priority story-wise, rather than having the show stuffed with ship battle sequences ad nauseum.

It's a masterpiece: the glorious cinematography and production values, the acting talent, the intricate storytelling and strategy, the articulate and beautifully written dialogue, the ships and amazing battles, all the lush sets and costumes. For every viewing we even watch the entire opening credits for the gorgeous imagery and music by Bear McReary.

5885215,4,B00E1LSX44,"The Pilot had me worried for a second. This is a great cast with a solid concept and impressive production value, but the first couple episodes seemed to focus too much on the bells-and-whistles of an adult drama (cussing just to cuss, bringing sex into almost every scenario to the point where you aren't sure what's really going to happen) instead of the plot itself. By Episode 3, I, a huge fan of Pirate lore, was almost ready to tearfully say goodbye to what I thought was a truly potential story.

But I kept watching, partly because I had seen articles saying it would find its pace and partly because I wanted a good pirate show SO BADLY.

And I'm glad I did. From Episode 4 onward, the show not only hits its stride but starts running. The characters I loved in the first few episodes got even better, and I started getting nervous anytime they had a brush with danger. After all, this ain't club med. The characters I didn't feel were as strong? Boom. Suddenly you find out their story, or at least the one thing that truly drive them, and not only does it make sense, they start to fit together wonderfully. By Episode 6 I had gone from worried to hooked, and I leaped right into Season 2 with fervor.

In short, if you feel a bit detached in the first few episodes, keep going. Don't make that decision until you've hit Episode 5. I know that's a ways to go, but like many shows sometimes that's how the development finally comes to completion. If you don't like it then, I'd guess it's not the show for you. But I have a feeling you'll be in for a treat.",1470700800,29,1567,4.341296928327645

I really like the continuity& ties to historic figures etc. A realistic not-so ""hollywood"" concept pirate show - yet very hollywood in production! When streaming in 4K I feel like I am ON THE SHIP! Sound quality is amazing as well, you hear every plank creak & lantern sway, wood bending or exploding, etc etc.. they didn't skimp on sound editing in the least -With Michael Bay around I am not really surprised either!",1468540800,,647,4.445378151260504

5885314,5,B00E1LSX44,"I will start by saying I AM purchasing both Season 1 & 2 of this series. I have also WATCHED all the seasons on Starz.  It is interesting to research and cat h small things youay have missed the first time. Plus, I am hoping for fun extras!  I read through many other reviews and most point out the plots well, so I am only going to give opinion here.

The show is cinematically fantastic. Every episode feels as though you are sitting in a theater ready to watch Capt. Jack Sparrow swash and buckle across the screen -- ONLY BETTER!  WAY BETTER, due to well researched historical information.  The costumes, sets, and small details are top notch. They have done a marvelous job of casting (both in looks, beauty, and TALENT).

After watching, I picked up a copy of Treasure Island just so I could catch  some of the little ""nods"" to that classic. It is intriguing what 20 years might do to a person. I also find myself occupying  Google to look up various info on many of the battles and historical figures. Call it a treasure hunt of my own. The writers are clever as they weave fact and fiction, marvelously.

 As myself, and others, have said the characters are very complex.  Many have creative and captivating back stories. In particular, I enjoy some side characters like Ann Bonny, Mr. Scott, and Billy Bones.  (Tom Hopper fans will LOVE Billy. He does a wonderful job with the character employing a talent for wit that is a surprise for someone who is often stereo-typed due to his looks. Don't get me wrong NOT complaining about his looks, either!)

Finally, I will remind this is STARZ. Nudity and SC abound in the first few episodes to create a bit of a shock value. I admit to being 40 and have seen a few things.  So ladies, especially, enjoy a few guilty pleasures.  If this isn't your thing, then get through it with a few blushes and an ""Oh, my!"" because the series story is entirely WORTH IT.  I was also a fan of Starz Spartacus if that helps.

I am a true fan and already anxiously awaiting Season 4!  Hurry up and get here!",1468454400,2,2044,4.405333333333333

Review of the show:

Pre-quel to Treasure Island + historical Nassau.  Think of it as if Pirates of the Caribbean and Game of Thrones had a child.  It follows the pirates in the early 1700's in their eventual war with England.  Season 1 starts off and is decent.  Season 2 I was more invested, and the end of Season 3 I would put on-par with any Game of Thrones season in terms of captivity and awesomeness.",1466467200,,586,4.132743362831858
5885354,1,B00E1LSX44,"A HUGE disappointment.  This series is full of horrible acting, horrible lines, horrible staging.  Just watching Black Beard (who is a woman, of course, who is called 'Blackbeard' for her giant 'beard' of pubic hair) walk around with her head in that weird head tilt so the bizarre witch like hat covers her head is so distracting that I can't focus on anything else going on in the scene.  The series might begin to pick up steam with better actors and better scenes and bam! another lesbian scene or orgies with absolutely no context or meaning at all.  They are long, mechanical, passionless and.. boring.  Just full frontal nudity that are directed 100% toward male teenagers. I would like to be able to watch a movie in my home without the shock and embarrassment of seeing a full on orgie.  This show is no Game of Thrones.  While that show did some of this, they ALSO had some of the very best storytelling I have ever seen.  Ick.",1466467200,6,937,4.535714285714286

I was one of those.  Normally I loathe prequels because they only serve to taint the original but his is not like that.  It has quite a bit of nudity and profanity which may turn some off however it has a fantastic story which follows the life and events of John Silver in the years preceding Treasure Island as well as laying the ground work for everything which happens in that story.  We get an understanding of why John Silver became Long John Silver, how his life formed the character and how he became a notorious pirate/cook.",1464307200,,709,4.315789473684211

5885414,5,B00E1LSX44,"Being essentially a working class Brit, with a characteristically earthy British working class sense of humour, I was always going to be drawn to the boxset of any series that lists one of its characters simply as 'Hand Job Sailor'. Indeed this is the case with Black Sails Season 1, a box set I'm thoroughly pleased to have purchased. Written as prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure novel 'Treasure Island' this is a well thought out and acted tale that is extremely entertaining. Featuring younger manifestations of Stevenson's characters, most notably John Silver and Ben Gunn, this is a bawdy pirate tale for grown-ups. In addition to convincing location shooting and excellent costumes, it contains an enjoyable mix of nudity, sex, violence, and fruity adult language. Indeed, its frequent use of good, old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon F and C-words gives the dialogue added credibility amongst the obligatory ""Arrh, young Jim lad"" moments. Entertaining viewing, recommended to the broad-minded.",1464307200,,1010,5.439490445859873

I support gay marriage rights and other things.  I have no problem with male homosexuality in someone else's living room.

5885550,3,B00E1LSX44,"I enjoyed this show for the most part. Most of the acting was fairly decent, dialog and plot were good and the setting is fun and interesting. My only real issue with the show itself was that season 1 felt a bit too much like a soap opera most of the time. I have since watched season 2 and felt that it picked up a bit better and got rid of that feeling and have decided to watch for season 3 when it becomes available as well.

My reason for only a 3 star instead of a 4 star which I feel this show deserved however was for the packaging. It has to be about the worst package I've ever seen! The little foldout is completely cardboard, which is no big deal, most season sets usually are but they always contain the plastic layer for the disc to sit in. Not this one. This series has a very inconvenient pouch where the discs slide in at stupid angles, scratching the discs to pieces as you try and remove them or put them back. This should have been better thought out and done completely differently. I'm mad to have to pay nearly $30 for a set of DVDs only to have them damaged from the cases, on top of the usually already damaged discs included in DVD cases as it is.",1459382400,3,1173,4.1

5885569,3,B00E1LSX44,"Haven't made it all the way through Season 1 yet, but so far, my response has been that this series is so-so. The story/plot is not terribly engaging or interesting and most of the characters are not fully developed nor are many that like-able. The grittiness in terms of violence (and to some extent the sex) is not a problem for me and may be somewhat historically accurate (except for the lesbian scenes... Sorry but even among pirates, at this point in history that element seems very forced and out of place). However, the dialogue continually takes me out of the show because it is wholly unbelievable as far as being historically accurate. Yes, yes, no doubt pirates used rough language, but what the writers don't seem to understand is that the rough language they used wasn't the same kind of language in use today. The F-bomb was not used at the time the way it is today but it litters the show constantly. In general the dialogue is just too contemporary and that annoys me. I have no problems with the language in Game of Thrones because it is a fantasy world. Spartacus was a show bordering on camp with how ridiculous it's gore, sex, and language were, so I just enjoyed it for how insanely exaggerated it was. Black Sails, on the other hand, seems like it wants to be taken seriously, and seems like it wants to be historically ""accurate"" to some degree, but either the writers don't know much about the language of the era or are too lazy to spend the effort to make it accurate. OR...they think the audience is too dumb to know the difference.",1457913600,,1560,4.535460992907802

I think they did this movie for a paycheck, not for the love of their profession. Generally, I watch the first of a series and give it some time to set up a story and get interesting.

5885630,5,B00E1LSX44,"Black Sails (seasons 1 and 2) Season 3 frorthcoming.
Since I was a wee lad, I have shared with many, a secret fantasy and fascination for a rogue life on the high seas.
Since the swashbuckling pictures of the 40s and 50s, Hollywood had not really given us a proper piracy film until the 2003 release of Curse of the Black Pearl with Johnny Depp. The quality of the cast and especially Depps brilliant rascal humor, temporarily satisfied most pirate fans, but frankly, serious authenticity was still lacking (skeletons coming to life?). The subsequent Pirates of the Caribbean sequels quickly degraded into Saturday-morning demographics stuff with slimy monsters and video-game special effectsall without the joy-stick. OK for kids I guess, but what about us?
The Starz series Black Sails has changed all that. It finally fulfills most, if not all of our cravings for more serious adult pirate fare.
Yes we have the base gratifications with gritty details and authenticity, exceptional photography, beautiful lush sets and locales, excellent sound effects and musical score, gorgeous ship battles, masterfully choreographed fights, shuddering scenes of bloody violence, and sexy, sweaty interludes. But we also have the higher brow elements with compelling characters, intriguing relationships, engaging storylines, and most importantly intelligent dialogue with stellar acting.
Especially for a TV series, Black Sails shines and effectively immerses you into its 18th century world. It is bad-ass pirate entertainment of the highest order and comes highly recommended.",1453766400,,1568,5.5103734439834025
5885631,5,B00E1LSX44,"I am obessesd with this series! it has been on my to-watch list since the first episode was released online early for free. I don't pay for Showtime/Starz/HBO..etc so I had to wait until it was available online and until I knew it was renewed for another season (as is my personal policy). Low and behold its been renewed for a third season! This is a fantastic period drama based loosely on real pirates such as Anne Bonney and Charles Vane and is a pre-treasure island story arch. It is very bloody, nitty, and gritty - it has a lot of full frontal/backside nudity for both male and females and some explicit sexual scenes, this is not a show for children or the fainthearted. It has a great main plot line that arches over two season and my guess possibly longer, along with smaller plot lines with resolutions and twists to keep you entertained and wanting more.

5885633,3,B00E1LSX44,"Well did not expect much, I had high hope from the first episode. The first episode was great, loved when the pirates board the ship and started fighting the apposing side. After that the show fell short, to the point of and I am serious when I say this. But I was thinking it would be better to use the disc's as coasters, yes really!. Sure there are plenty of good looking women, but the plot was weak and getting weaker through every episode. Also the show abuses the ""F"" word to the point of it just get's dumb just constantly hearing it. The sword fights were ok, the boarding of ships to way to long to do and the naval battles were boring.

This show reminded me of a show called ""Deadwood"" , except it was set in a different era. But being somewhat retarted, I will probly buy or rent the second season, just to see how the story ended.",1453680000,,844,4.209876543209877

5885646,5,B00E1LSX44,"Love the show, which is why I'm giving it this rating, but I'm seriously unhappy with this blu-ray set.

First off, the packaging is ridiculous. It's a struggle to get discs out.

Beyond that, I'm having the worst trouble with getting the discs to actually play! They aren't scratched, no smudges, no lint, no dust, not even condensation from breathing on it, and yet certain episodes skip like mad. I've taken them out, I've cleaned them off, I've tried other blu-ray discs to see if it is my player (it isn't), and nothing is working. I've never had an entire set of discs mess up like this. Did I get a dud set or something?

Episode VIII is entirely unwatchable. I should've just bought it on download or something, not bothered with these glitchy discs that DO NOT WORK!",1452902400,,775,4.561151079136691
5885647,5,B00E1LSX44,"How is this series not more popular? It looks FAN-TASTIC! The sets look beyond real. Little things like the sound of ropes creaking in the wind and the seaspray make you feel that you're right there. The storylines are not just some run-of-the-mill ""go get yee treasure, mate"" although the search for an El Dorado is basically the main driving force behind all the intrigue and adventure.

Sure, it's grisly and bloody but it's also super sexy (we're talking full frontal, folks, and some very hot bods). Every character seems to have some ulterior motive which makes all the political intrigue all the better. Yes, it's not only the stuff of legend. There is a whole drama surrounding the town and as much of the series takes place on land as it does on the waters of the Caribbean. The brothel is just wild and not just because of the sex. It's a microcosm of the financial ins and outs of trade that passes through Nassau where this pirate haven is set. In fact, the entire series fleshes out (sorry, bad pun) the whole financial arrangement between raiders and the people who buy/sell those goods.

Lastly, the casting is spot on. Every single role right down to the bit players is note perfect. There literally is not a single actor who is not perfect for their role. The only sad note (SPOILER ALERT) is Billy Bones went MIA. I am hopeful he turns up alive in Season Two.

The extras are really nice as well and the stuff on how they filmed the ship scenes is totally enthralling.",1452816000,,1486,4.537313432835821

There is a lot of nudity and lesbian love scenes that leaves one wondering what effect it really has on plot or character development. Perhaps, the writer is seeking to be politically correct and cash in on certain social/ political groups? Pointless and tasteless sex bits are annoying.  Plots of each issue are very simple with lots of time wasted on scenes as characters running over rocks, or rushing through the town, etc. rather than getting to the point ie why they are running or going through the town or going to do whatever. I will sell this dvd and seek to get something of my money back. It is simply not as an interesting tale about pirates as I hoped it would be.",1452297600,10,803,4.695035460992908

None of this wishy-washy crap where you wonder where this character or that one did this or that or if they are a main character or if you've ever even seen them before. Even the extras are distinctive!

The production value, writing, character development, & good god everything about this is cranked up to 11. The fact that this was a television series blows me away. Reminds me of Battlestar Galactica - not a complement I've given nor am likely to give to ANY other show.

Now I can't say all of that without SOMETHING to gripe about. Even though each episode is almost a solid hour, there are only a few episodes in season 1. Such is the way of almost all new shows, so I don't fault them. Also, like I said the production value is off the charts, so keeping costs under control was probably a concern. Thankfully there are more episodes in season 2. Trust me, just go ahead & buy it ;-)

Anyway, if you're interested in am unflinching look at early 18th century pirates, or just a great action story with lost of surprises - THIS is the place to be.",1450396800,,1145,4.4688995215311005

5885665,5,B00E1LSX44,"I started watching Season 1 after Season 2 was out, and am 3/4 through Season 2. Although Season 1 is slow, in Season 2 the show comes into itself. In Season 2 the plots get far more interesting and the characters get deeper and more complex. Although I don't care for the excessive nudity, and wish they would cut it out, if you can ignore it and get past that, Season 2 is extremely enjoyable. The plots and the characters are becoming  more complex in Season 2 and the storylines are gripping. This show is turning out to be quite excellent and I hope it continues for many more seasons.

The sets are simply incredible and realistic as ever. Additionally, I find it refreshing to watch a more realistic and gritty depiction of pirates and pirate life after all the silly Disney romanticizing and watered down depictions of pirates. It is interesting to see the pirates' place and their reactions to the social and political issues of their day. Fascinating historical context in the background of the adventures and stories of people who may be fiction, but who just as likely could have been real. I enjoy historical fiction for this reason and Black Sails fits very well into the kinds of historical fiction that I enjoy. It is an all around great period piece, save for it's excessive nudity. This is not a family show, it is an adult show. And as an adult show, it is extremely interesting and entertaining.

In summary, with Season 2 Black Sails has grown into an excellent show and I hope it continues for many more seasons.",1450137600,,1534,4.591240875912408

5885699,5,B00E1LSX44,"Wow so I just finished re-watching S1 of Black Sails today and I figured that I would give you my written review. I absolutely love this
show. I will start with the story which takes place in 1715 roughly 20 years prior to ""Treasure Island"" and revolves around Captain Flint and how him and his crew try to survive and thrive in Nassau. I admire that time period very much and they captured the aesthetic perfectly in my opinion. The visuals and sound design are superfluous in the best way possible. I will now move onto the acting which was cast flawlessly. The 2 main characters are Captain Flint played by Toby Stephens and Captain Charles Vane played by Zach McGowan. The other cast members while major also did a tremendously great job portraying there characters. I will now move onto the action and Holy Smokes let me tell you that it's Intense. The whole crew from the writers to directors and etc spared no expense when showing the brutality of open water war. The fighting was vicious and relentless which I love. I would recommend it especially if you like Spartacus or Game of Thrones then you will love this show. I will say that it doesn't have the amount of violence that is displayed in the shows I just mentioned but it's still up there with the best of them. I will finish off by saying that you should watch this show immediately. I'm going to be buying S2 on Blu-ray next week. I haven't seen it yet but when I do I will post my review for Season 2 as well.

Lesbian soft-core porn seems so out of place in a story thats supposedly about Pirates.  This looks so much like those soft-core porn movies you see on the motel cable TV and has about the same poorly written dialog and plot.

5885715,1,B00E1LSX44,"Black Sails - Season 1 - [0646- October 4, 2015]

Summary:
 I had great expectations for this show. The concept of a series about pirates appealed to me. I've had my fill of detective shows. Now pirates that's an idea that could result in very engaging viewing, some fascinating historical themes and sailing ship adventures on the high seas. I regret to state that I was very disappointed with season 1 and will not bother with subsequent seasons.

Content:
 The eight episodes of Season 1 were first broadcast on the Starz cable network January, 25 2014 - March 15, 2014. The DVD package consist of 3 disks and a number of extra features on disk 3. The DVD packaging is sturdy and very eye-catching - in fact the slip case has a cool 3-D image on the cover.

Positive Comments:
 A lot of money was spent on the ships and they did give the show a veneer of authenticity.

Negative Comments:
 My dislike of this show had to do with the overall thematic attitude of the pirate concept as presented. The dialogue ,appearance and ""look"" was like a poke in the ribs by a con man: ""wait until you see my snarky pirate show with beautiful babes, muscle boys with great teeth and of course a pirate queen just to be politically correct and catch the female viewer"". Ho-hum mates I'll just have to rerun my Horatio Hornblower DVD's to get my dose of nautical fantasy.",1443916800,,1359,4.495934959349594

I'm also tired of any movie or series getting a five star rating just because it shows boobs upteen dozen times. If this is your cup of tea, then you'll love Black Sails.

5885739,3,B00E1LSX44,"""Crossbones"" and this showI can't tell which, but one is a rip-off of the other. They both have the premise that a pirate crew desperately wants instructions that, once followed, will change the world for them, and the possessor of said instructions preserves his own life by memorizing the contents and destroying the paper, ensuing a season of falsely important relationships, shallow intrigue, and impulsive resolutions, none showing much progress to show when the season ends. Both shows have great production value and committed actors, but ""BS"" has nudity and the F word. The decision on which to view bears on the age of your audience. Also, Charles Vane is historically inaccurate: he successfully was recklessly violent, and made a name for pirates more than many others. I was pumped to see his character here, but found wanting as I waited for his reputation to come through. He's portrayed more as a pining pushover.",1441411200,2,928,5.032467532467533

5885771,5,B00E1LSX44,"This is the ONLY show I've purchased in DVD form ever, because I did not have access to watching it on TV. It is the gritty, hellish world of actual piracy come to life through loose depictions of actual historical figures. This show came out around the same time as the pretty historically-accurate Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and also happens to take place in 1715-16 Nassau. So coupled together, these two stories became the closest I'll ever get to reliving a life of piracy in the Caribbean. Unless I actually become a pirate.

I highly recommend this show for its complicated series of plots, subplots, sub-subplots, and a heap of characters you will admire, hate, or want to roll in bed with. Each episode is jam-packed with drama and occasional violencemuch like the real world of the Caribbean back then.

Stop shopping and buy this now.

Comment on all the stupid 1-star ratings: Only in the United States of America would people be so offended by nudity as to leave 1 Star reviews. Seriously people? Grow the hell up. News flash: Sex is a REAL thing! Pirates had a lot of it back in the day. NONE of us would be here without it. It's not taboo. It's what people do on a (hopefully) daily or weekly basisespecially pirates. To not have sex in the show would be in poor taste and a bad decision against historical integrity.

5885774,2,B00E1LSX44,"The series starts with some good action on-board, in fact these are the sequences they use and continue to use to advertise the series all the way through as they are certainly the best bits. However, for most of the rest of series we are stuck on land with no sea action involved except threats of it along with some pretty unlikely scenarios. Then there's the gratuitous swearing, some rather odd sex scenes and nudity which weren't really necessary or needed.

They also must have had some fine dental surgeons back then on the islands too, as I can barely think of a period drama I've seen with so many pearly white gleaming teeth dazzling the screen, very Hollywood I must say and certainly not what one expects from cut-throat pirate killers.

And that's the way it continues, it just doesn't feel right, raw enough or believable in any way, me hearties !!

The film Master and Commander with Russell Crowe as a seafaring yarn is infinitely better in every aspect, and at least in that most of the time is spent as sea, as one would expect pirates to be too. But alas in Black Sails these are mainly land-based pirates who don't do much pirating and it's all been rather disappointing.",1438387200,3,1191,4.582159624413146

I think it succeeds on that front in that the world portrayed just feels real. Each character has their own motivations, secrets, and vices, and the complexity of the show really holds your attention as we jump from character to character, each of which has their own story going on. The show is kind of like Game of Thrones in that sense, and much like GoT there is a lot of sex and nudity in Black Sails.

5885821,4,B00E1LSX44,"Long before Disney proved their modern blockbuster viability with its Johnny Depp franchise, pirates rose to prominence as popular cinematic characters in both heroic and villainous roles. Theres just something about a character archetype thats willing to save the girl one moment only to toss her aside the next if it means he gets more gold that makes for interesting storytelling. When a driving characteristic of your character is that they're opportunistic to a fault, any story you want to tell about them can lead to some very interesting places (geographically and politically), and that facet is only enhanced when you start drawing in historical references like Black Sails has. For that reason, Starzs Black Sails bursts with potential and just might enjoy the same longevity that similar recent shows about anti-heroes have (see Sons of Anarchy, Dexter, etc.).

The series starts off with its primary protagonist, Captain Flint (Toby Stephens), leading the crew of the Walrus on a raid of an unfortunate merchant ship, only to discover theres little aboard in terms of loot, with the biggest takeaway being a new crew member, John Silver (Luke Arnold). Silver saves his skin by claiming hes a cook and arrives on the Walrus just in time to witness a power struggle that leaves Flint with a tenuous grip and an increasingly disloyal crew. It turns out Flint has led his men on a number of fruitless raids in the recent months and the answer to why lies in a scrap of paper Silver has in his possession. What that piece of paper alludes to has the power to stir rival pirate captains (like Zach McGowans Captain Vane) to take bold steps and severe old alliances in the pirate town of New Providence, forcing the local master of trade, Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New), to abandon the business thats kept her at the top of the food chain for so long and forge a new future for the island, all while entrusting that Captain Flints foolhardy crusade will yield the riches he claims. All of this is juggled rather deftly, allowing a number of tertiary characters to develop into something much more.

Black Sails is many things all at once. First and foremost, its an ensemble piece. Flint might be the primary protagonist, and certainly the one the audience most wants to see succeed, but the manipulative nature of Silver to do whatevers necessary to survive and the determination of Eleanor to keep New Providence from burning to the ground make it clear that theres no singular hero here, and that any character can rise up when given the chance. One of the most entertaining side stories is the up and down fortunes of Rackham (Toby Schmitz) and Anne Bonny (Clara Paget) who start as bit players in another pirates crew but quickly become two of the best characters in the show.  And thats perhaps the aspect of Black Sails most likely to ensure its survival for many seasons:  the deep bench of characters.

Speaking of that deep bench, one of the most fascinating choices of Black Sails is its inclusion of real pirates from history instead of just making up characters and keeping the story contained within a fictional universe. Theres only one fictional primary pirate character and thats Flint, but even he comes with a bit of history attached to him thanks to his being the captain of the Walrus in Robert Louis Stevensons Treasure Island (and then borrowed by many other writers for use in other pirate tales). As more and more pirates pop up, its fun to do a quick Google search and see exactly what that particular pirates history is. Even the antagonist pirate Vane was a real person, and parts of his arc in the series align to his actual deeds. Were it not for the sex, Black Sails feels like the kind of series History Channel wishes it was producing and should be producing  of course it probably would have to cut back on production values at that point.

But its the fact that Black Sails doesnt skimp on production value means that allows it to play up its more adventurous moments instead of downplaying them or editing around them, allowing the series to develop strong political drama and swashbuckling action qualities in each episode  which goes back to my earlier point that Black Sails never shies away from trying to be more than one kind of show. Without those sea battles, however, theres no way Black Sails would feel as legitimate as it does, and it pulls those off with such aplomb that sometimes you cant help but marvel at the production values visible throughout the show.  During those sea skirmishes (with or without cannons), Black Sails is one of the most cinematic shows on television. The quality might dip down to Saturday afternoon serial when it gets back to dialogue-heavy scenes on-shore, but the excellent visuals it produces otherwise make it all worthwhile. It also doesnt hurt that the more dialogue-heavy moments tend to involve island politicking and thus flesh out character motivations and rivalries, making it easier to overlook some of these less visually stellar scenes.

All of that great stuff aside, Black Sails is by no means perfect, but theres definite proof of growth as the first season goes on. The most striking example is the first episodes almost comical insistence on nudity for the sake of reminding us that were watching series developed for premium cable where nudity is a calling card not an exception.  Nudity pops up throughout the series, but its often more functional than it is gratuitous once you get past the pilot episode; its as if they shoved 3-4 moments of nudity into the pilot purely for the sake of hooking viewers who might have been watching for no other reason. Past that, you get sex scenes (after all, one of the piratess preferred work motivators is the sex tent) but they feel much more germane to character arcs and less like obligatory moments thrown in to meet a quota.

Black Sails had an exceptional but imperfect first season, but its concept and its high production values mean itll likely get even better as the writing continues to hone in on its best elements. Black Sails deserves your attention, give it a shot.

Blu-ray Bonus Features

Clearly Anchor Bay is proud of Black Sails' production values (as they should be  even if I think Ive now talked about them too much), and so the extras dive almost explicitly into those waters by exploring costumes, locations, the ships, and then production featurettes on the shows politics, pirate history, and general filming.

Finally, the Blu-ray pack also includes an Ultraviolet digital copy of the season.

5885856,4,B00E1LSX44,"CONTAINS SPOILERS?! of minor consequence-- and 1 parenting tip.

It's already been said that this series is liberally laced with, mostly gratuitous, nudity and sex, in multiple forms.  If that offends you, yet you still feel compelled or entitled to gorge on the inherent savagery and violence, interspersed with scenes and characters of some historical 'note', why not just put the kiddies to bed and simply make another choice for family time?
  As I now understand, Season 2 continues very much in the same vein. Now you're forewarned.
  So, while I enjoyed the entire production generally, I also found enough faults so as to be grating on me, as well as disconcerting at times. From the stylistically menacing logo, to the intrinsically brutal content of genre, I expected exactly that: a DARK, ADULT historical fantasy. What this series gave me, personally, was a tad bit less than that.

The Visuals:
  Sailing ships on open CGI seas virtually never translate well to my mind's eye. I have this pesky mental alarm that shrieks at me when the boats fail to move in a natural way, as I know them to do. However, the static sets look far more authentic, even when enhanced with tech, with some even approaching sumptuousness.
Scenes shown as Lavishly Dark include, among others, The Opening Massacre, The Bordello, The Prison Ship.

The Primary Men:
  Of ALL of them, only Captain Vane fully convinced me that he actually was One Scary Dude. And, ladies beware of what he be packin'. Captain Flint had an early moment as Full On Pirate while in defense of his captaincy. But, even with his strong aspirations for gold, much of the time it feels as though he's merely biding his time, waiting for the next CALVIN Klein cover shoot. Worse, most of the rest of the main cast honestly struck me as caricatures, rather than the Tough Guys we all envision pirates to be. Many of them fail to convey true, proper menace, with  the exception of the ordinary sailors, who appeared as a suitably scurvy lot, to be sure.  Others seemed to be channeling (and with respect to) KEVIN Kline, as seen in, ' 'Pirates of Penzance'. More than once, I almost expected them to break into song and dance. Sort of sidetracked the kind of mood I was after.

The Primary Women:
Eleanor Guthrie; (Hannah New)
  With her being a bona fide model in real life, I now believe that's her true calling. With her being a past grad of an actual acting school, I believe there was skullduggery there. Presented as the most Powerful  Person in Nassau, while running her father's amoral trading business, I'd expected steel in her spine and fire in her eyes. Seemed like the steel was co-opted for cutlass and sabre, and the fire was winked out in a gale.
  Spouting copious F-bombs and lewd- speak all around, her face seldom followed that lead. Her expressions often called to mind the quintessential spoiled (spoilt) English brat you see in every other Brit-flick, where the emotion portends that her favorite tomahto jam has run out. I interpreted that look, in select scenes, as her tantamount problem. The determined squint just seems to denote the need of an oculist. She also, and often, employs that perennial fall back so many men are loath to engage; The Oft Dreaded, 'Verge Of Tears'.
  That's all we get here folks--precious little shrewd, strong, empowered female showcased to either emulate or fear--yet, none of the cast ( nor the ten reviewers I read) seemed to have noticed, much less preyed, on these weaknesses. Excepting, of course, Charles Vain.
  That she controls the fiercest men on the planet is ridiculous, Sorry. Although, her ruthless betrayal of Max was inspired; and in all fairness, she does have an additional ""moment"" or two.

Max: (Jessica Parker Kennedy)
  This Canadian actor is endowed with all things sublime; I shall not consider, nor entertain, any charges against her!
While petite in stature, this woman IS strong. Also,  smoldering, exotically beautiful, and built to survive. She's endearingly vulnerable, as well; as all Hookers With Mojo must be. While her delightful faux French accent sometimes fades somewhat toward the British, I'll allow, as it's true to locale.

Anne Bonny  (Clara Paget)
  Introduced as stealthy, sinister, and deadly, as one would  believe of a historically noteworthy female pirate of the era, Paget easily managed to blaze a few of the limited scenes in which she appears, with this next one in particular.
  After a fiery rant to Rackham, in which she warns him that Max is not to be trusted, she passes Max's open (of course) door, beyond which stands The Lady In Question, languorously nude (of course) whilst facing a full length mirror. Bonny, rather than confronting the woman she, moments before, had been railing against, freezes, then melts like a cup of red jello in the hot, afternoon sun. Her lingering gaze, all at once, becomes pensive; then quickly transforms into stark, naked longing, as she remains fully clothed.
  The subsequent lowering of her eyes serves to predict, first, her emotional, then physical, descent  from the balconied, upper floor room, and blatantly underscores Bonny's palpable loneliness.
  As a competitor in a marketplace of uncertain resources, Max simply knows these things in her non-judgmental way, and merely responds with her eyes that she understands all of that, yet remains open to whatever may come.
  For me, this was the most poignant and beautifully nuanced performance of the entire season. Just watch their faces.. You can measure the actors timing in heartbeats.

The scene occurs, roughly, 17 minutes into Episode 8 Season 1.
Watch it again in slo-mo.

So, given my complaints, will I watch Season 2?

Black Sails has almost the same amount of gratuitous sex scenes as Spartacus, but somehow, I don't know why, I don't buy all the stuff that's going on in Black Sails.  Were women actually as powerful as Eleanor is depicted back in the 1700's?  I love history and strong women, but I'm not buying this with women being on equal footing or better with these types of men.  And, for some reason, every time the actress says the F-word, it just sounds ridiculous coming out of her mouth, at least for me, she doesn't have the right persona.  Lucy Lawless got away with that much better.  As has been mentioned, there's a lot of cursing, which I don't mind all that much except again, for the women.  There's also a lot of time spent in brothels and beds.  What all of that has to do with piracy besides shore leave titillation I'm not quite getting, I'm assuming all the sex is meant for ""it's a guy thing,"" i.e, all the two women scenes, is there really some necessity for this type of thing besides drawing in male viewers?  Sorry, I don't see what any of that had to do with 18th century piracy except for shore leave distraction.

The plot line does develop and there is a story here worth following. Some of the casting is rather poor and some of the acting not particularly high quality; Hannah New is, well, very new. To acting. And it shows. Maggie Smith's son Toby is predominantly a stage actor which I think explains why he appears as if he went to the Roger Moore school of screen acting; his emotional transitions are wonting. The 'tit and arse' quotient almost disappears as you get into season two but the ladies do get a fluffed up willy, just for balance you understand. As this takes off I'm sure more cash will be allocated to improving the CGI effects. The gentle recoil of cannon after firing is utterly unconvincing, the abundance of straight from the local chandlery modern ropes and cordage, and the incorrect use of naval terminology is grating but that's just my personal bugbear.

5885934,4,B00E1LSX44,"Starz series ""Black Sails"", an epic English Pirate themed action adventure drama that apparently is a rate R level ""prequel"" to Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" adventure book.  Apparently from what I have observed this series takes place in Nassau the Bahamas, & other Caribbean locations with some occasional flashback scenes in Great Britain.

 If I were in command at the Pentagon, I would make the episodes of this show mandatory for all members of the US Navy and Marine Corps, to see the world's Naval history and heritage acted out in realistic settings.

 Like other recent popular shows related to this drama on premium pay channel cable, the action and violence of this show is realistic and intense, for these Pirates are NOT Disney nor Johnny Depp's characters.  Pirates seem to be presented the way the really were, VERY politically incorrect, brutal, vicious, and savage in a cut throat kill or be killed dark world of survival and greed.

 The apparent issue I immediately had with this series was the dialogue, it seemed to my own perception (or opinion) that these screen writers did not make a major attempt to provide these actors with the lines that people from 1705 would say to each other.  I felt like I had been listening to contemporary 2015 British accents and speeches, and not the speech or dialect from the 1700's.  But never the less the action and drama are pretty remarkable from what episodes I have viewed so far.  The one major element I'd like to continue to view is how this series handles women characters in what was clearly a brutal male orientated genre and period, in the world of European Navies sailing back and forth to the New World interacting with New World piracy.

 They have some tough female characters handling their own against rival male pirates, and we have some realistic interactions that might have been plausible for that very wild era of history.  The show presents us with aggressive & desperate people ruthlessly trying to take from this world as much as they can, and have no problem sticking it toward others if they need to, we have despotic rival Empires both fighting against or allying with pirate warriors at sea for their own strategic ends.  The show delightfully is adult themed so we have some sexual imagery which most American shows lack drastically because of political correctness and censorship rules, so ultimately this is by far the most original and realistic dramatic piece on actual historical piracy that has really not been done at all before in the past.

 Like HBO's ""Game of Thrones"", the show is a bit slow where the action does occur but sparingly compared with other related franchises.

 I did have a sense of other material from outside sources seem to influence this show, such as the late Michael Crichton's ""Pirate Latitudes"" which I had actually liked because it presented the topic on a much more edgy scale.

 Pirates, like Vikings and Spartans or other hard core historical warriors, were NOT rated PG or politically correct actors in human history.  Pirates tortured people, they shot people, they raided, they plundered, they drank alcohol to excess, they tore clothes off & raped women, they kidnapped people, they set things on fire, they stole, they fought with swords and axes, and they fought not only the Navies of other countries they also fought each other giving loyalty to none. They were not nice people, thus they like other groups represented the true monsters of history, yet many of us find ourselves so attracted to their life style freedom at sea.

Nothing so far in more recent past Hollywood or other entertainment media has portrayed pirates like this, for Hollywood has given us films and tv shows like, ""Hook 1992"", ""Horatio Hornblower"", ""Treasure Island"", and more recently Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which were virtually all watered down PG material aimed for younger audiences.  Why were more real pirate stories denied to us by Hollywood for so many years??? So thankfully Starz has presented us for material that goes into depth what the more historical theme had been.

 Modern CGI effects allow for shows like this to present more visually graphic, and more realistic looking imagery that make us believe we are taken to the 1700's Caribbean and not seeing something cheap that only resembles it.  The ships at sea look very good, the sets are well done, the costumes work, and so do the stunts. Looking forward to seeing more material from this show, although so far I will say it is for what ever reason still not on the level with Starz's ""Camelot"" with actress Eva Green nor Martin & HBO's ""Game of Thrones"", thus is why I have given this series four stars instead of five.  Thumbs up and B+/ A- for ""Black Sails"".  ""Rah, pieces of eight, rah pieces of eight!!!""",1427500800,,4818,4.841463414634147

Have you ever met pirates that did everything but recover stolen gold? I'm 8 episodes into Season 2 and they still don't have it. Still. Maybe the creators were going for political theater but all I am getting is that pirates whine a lot. Hey, there's this guy Captain Flynt over here that has brought us farther than we ever would have gotten with anyone else, but...well...gonna whine and complain anyway!

5885962,4,B00E1LSX44,"Incredible visuals abound in this series - you can tell that there was been some serious money spent in costumes/locations/ships.  The acting doesn't stand out - but it's about pirates, so you weren't in this initially for some long monologues.  Watching the early character developments for whom is going to team with whom is interesting.  Michael Bay is involved, so you know that you are in this for the visual tour-de-force that you expect.  You know the story of Treasure Island - so there are some parts to it that may seem like ""cliffhanger"" quality parts - but ultimately you know who will survive.  It's nice to have the added quality of real life pirates from history woven into the story line.  Give this series a chance - if you don't like it after a couple of episodes, then its not for you.",1426464000,,804,4.5874125874125875
5885963,3,B00E1LSX44,"I bought this for two reasons: Toby Stephens and Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. Toby Stephens has long been a favorite actor of mine. He's a solid performer that tends to be in high quality productions, so when I saw his name attached to this, I thought I'd give it a try. The other thing was, I learned a lot about piracy and the Caribbean after playing Black Flag. It intrigued me to want to know more about that fascinating history. I doubt I would have ever given this a look had it not been for those two things.

I found the story slow. What is going on in the beginning of each episode changes by the end, but it wasn't all that exciting. All the characters are shady. There is absolutely no love or loyalty in this so it's hard to root for anyone.

What was interesting is the history that wraps around the stories. Some of the characters were real people. Some of the events really did happen. It makes me wonder about this big world and all the things that are going on at any minute. Life is just fantastic when you look at it in that way.

If you don't like sex, nudity, and violence, steer clear. There is more than anyone would ever need here. I could have done without that part.",1426377600,,1193,4.269911504424779

5885967,5,B00E1LSX44,"Love the TV series, great music, sets, drama/writing, acting. You kinda currently have 3 different pirate ""crew-masters,"" if you will, at the moment crossing paths, but they all have there own agenda and endgame. Do I wish there were more seafaring scenes, I do, but understand the show's main stage/set at the moment is Nassau where there is an established hub of activity to move the plot along with multiple plot arcs working together all at once. Just a great period drama that pays attention to the small details, and great theme score.

Not sure why so many are disappointed about the sexual scenes in nature. There are actually some character development in some of those scenes. The show is cable rated MA, which means there is going to be nudity in the series, maybe not every show, but it will surface. If you see MA cable rating, then do not watch if you are squeamish about sex/nudity. The DVD is rate NR, but it is MA.",1426291200,,931,4.574850299401198

5885985,2,B00E1LSX44,"I was excited for this show and was looking for a good show with action and a story. The story is not a bad one in itself but some of the actor's lack of charisma and the pacing of the show really make this show drag on. Now I've never read Treasure Island so I'm just going off the story and how it goes. I have to say that the story is interesting but it just doesn't feel authentic, with characters having perfect teeth and with most of them speaking with intelligence puts me out of the atmosphere of pirates. I seen some reviews on here and they just give it amazing reviews stating it that the show is great, that's fine but I have to disagree.

Pros: Nice story line and a few good actor's ability to bring out the personality of a character.
Cons: Poor pacing, characters are too clean, bad acting from a few key characters.

5885996,2,B00E1LSX44,"When I first heard about this series I was hopeful. I mean to tell the story of Long John Silver before he lost his leg and went looking for Treasure Island seemed like an inventive story that had the potential to make for a rip roaring time. Unfortunately that isn't the case with the results on view here. Instead I felt more like they were trying to insert present day concepts into past history.

While the story of Silver was a fictional one the times written about were not. I would say that I don't understand why the makers of this chose to ignore that and go with contemporary bits and pieces but I do know. Its all about marketing and polls or at least what they think the results of those would be. Maybe its just the crowd I hang out with but I don't have any friends clamoring for yet another cable show that features gratuitous amounts of skin and bloodshed while lacking in a decent story to carry them along.

The story features the crew of a pirate ship ruled by Captain Flint (Toby Stephens), a cut throat pirate if there ever was one and opens with their ransacking of a ship on the high seas. On board this ship is a young man by the name of John Silver (Luke Arnold), a familiar name but far removed from the stories we all know and love. Silver is on board the ship and taking a cue from the ships cook identifies himself as that position so as to stave off being killed. Recruited to the life of a pirate things seem to be fine for Silver. After landing on Nassau, the island home of the pirates and their crews, he is tossed into bed with a group of prostitutes and left until morning.

Unbeknownst to Captain Flint, Silver took a page from the real cook before seeing to his demise, a page from the captured captains logbook that identifies where a long lost and incredibly large treasure is located. It is this page that the Flint is trying to find as well as the treasure itself. In a revealing moment Flint tell his trusted mate that the reason he wants this treasure is to barter for the lives of his men. Hes intelligent enough to see the future and knows that being a pirate limits the chances of a long life. With this treasure he would have the means to bargain for the lives of his men and the chance for all to live as free men.

But there is much skullduggery going on in this show, sometimes to the point of making it difficult to watch and retain. It unravels at a snails pace which is odd for what one would consider to be a show in the action/adventure genre. The action is relatively rare at first here. The story that unfolds does so in bits and pieces but never enough to truly satisfy per episode.

On the whole I won't say that this series truly stinks but it does leave a lot to be desired. More action would be the first recommendation I would add to the series. The second thing is to step away from the new cable TV standard which is to insert sex into every series not on broadcast television. More often than not it adds little to the story and slows things down. Here we have it as well as the new trend which is girl on girl sex. Perhaps that was considered bold and daring 20 years ago but these days its becoming just something to toss in to try and tell people you're edgy without really being so.

I know Ill go back and give this a try again someday down the road. But for the moment with all of the choices and options of things out there to watch this one is low on my list.",1425168000,,3434,4.211246200607903

5886070,5,B00E1LSX44,"When people think of pirates, what typically comes to mind are the stereotypical images of a bearded captain with a parrot on his shoulder.  The present series deliberately avoids such cliche' images.  What a lot of people don't know is that most pirates were sailors for the British navy during Queen Anne's war.  At the war's conclusion, they were politely told that their services were no longer needed.  This, in turn, led to an explosion in piracy in the Caribbean.  As such, many pirate captains were formerly highly educated officers in the British navy.

BLACK SAILS relays these motifs in a historically accurate manner.  The series contains many applicable themes from the age of the pirates:  sea battles, a pirate's cove, thugish dudes committing acts of thugery as well as pirate ships hunting merchant vessels while doing all they can to avoid engaging dreadnoughts from European navies.  Instead of the usual secret treasure map, the center of gravity of the series is a secret schedule that details the travel times of a Spanish merchant ship that is LOADED with gold.

Such is an overview of the series.  Everything about the series is done on a grand scale;  they didn't ""go cheap"" on any of the details or get careless in bringing the 17th century back to life.  Indeed, there were a few wide shots of a harbor full of pirate ships where I thought ""Wow, I really do feel like I'm back in the age of the pirates.""  The acting is superb, especially Hannah New as the beautiful but tough-as-nails barkeep who actually intimidates the pirates (well, most of them anyway).  As a bonus, the story also includes a few historical pirates who are mixed in with fictional characters.

If you are at all interested in pirate movies, then this one is an absolute must have.  I was suspicious about whether they would make an entire series on the pirates, but they pulled it off.  I am already looking forward to season #2 coming out in a yr or so!!",1422662400,2,1955,4.7

5886088,3,B00E1LSX44,"I just finished watching the First Series of this new STARZ show and sorry to say have mixed feelings.  Having grown up with lots of adventure movies based on Treasure Island and Errol Flynn swashbuckling his way o'er the waves I was really hoping this new show would make these cold January nights a lot more enjoyable.  Overall, fine production values, decent special effects for the battles and ship scenes, and a fairly good ensemble cast, with a number of strong players - in particular, Flint/Toby Stephens, Silver/Luke Arnold, Billy Bones/Tom Hopper, and Gates/Mark Ryan, (unfortunately these latter two, engaging actors/characters have seemingly been killed off! go figure!?!).  My disappointments are especially due to the complex, meandering script, which is very hard to ""fathom"" and the poor recording of the dialogue, which for too much of each episode, is usually almost incoherent! I've noticed this in other productions and movies of late and have yet to understand why any production company would allow actors to mumble or be inarticulate in production.  Also, the word f*#+k seems to be over use to the point wherein it is so weakened that it becomes downright silly!  Last but not least, there is far too much gratuitous sex in this show....and I hate to sound like a prude, but it's just dopey.  It doesn't add any depth to any of the characters and is never sensual of ""hot"" (as it usually was in STARZ last great series, SPARTACUS.  The gratuitous nature of this is especially seen in frequent lesbian scenes by the ladies, which is activity I'm sure went on way back in the 1700's but I doubt ladies did this with the frequency of the actresses on this show!  Anyway, worth a rental at least, but not sure I will purchase Season 2 unless the clips and videos on YouTube show better writing and better acting.  Oh, and the disc box is merely cardboard sleeves, so again, low values or somebody cutting corners leaves this customer wanting.",1421539200,2,1962,4.850299401197605
5886089,5,B00E1LSX44,"I recently became acquainted with this show and I'm very glad I did! Black Sails, based in 1715, demonstrates pirates on the Bahamas, similar to the ""Flying Gang,"" with wholly believable characters, and daily insurrections just like any other proprietary colony of the period: the Bahamas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, etc. Black Sails is filled with fictional characters from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island, but also actual historical characters from the Golden Age of Piracy and the portrayal is very much like what I would have expected on the Bahamas in 1715. The Guthries (Eleanor and her father Richard) from Boston as the proprietors of a loot-fencing operation dealing in stolen merchandize with the pirates may have been inspired by an actual British report that also was the first record for Blackbeard. Furthermore, the sole purpose of Capt. Flint's obsession, the ""Urca de Lima"" was, in reality, one of 11 ships in Juan Esteban de Ubilla's flotilla that crashed on the Florida shores on July 28, 1715. Benerson Little is the historical consultant for this show and he knows his history! The coming 2015 season even promises to introduce Col. William Rhett of South Carolina, a character that I have studied in depth for many years! In my opinion, Black Sails, despite the blend of fiction with reality, is truer to actual history than most pirate shows. The spirit of the era is captured. As a maritime historian, I have greatly enjoyed this show.",1421539200,,1476,5.05327868852459

5886091,5,B00E1LSX44,"I've read all of the one star reviews. I've read none of the other reviews. So I suppose my review of the first season of Black Sails will combine what I think of the production with some of the criticisms I've read.

Overall, I think this is an outstanding production. I say this after watching the first season for the second time. After doing so, one begins to see all of the pieces click into place. All of the characters; all of their schemes; how they interact with each other; what they want for themselves; all of this becomes clear after watching this series the second time around. I'm not going to delve into each character individually; one could write an entire paragraph on each cast member and what he or she portrays.

Suffice to say that the theme of this series is so incredibly Machiavellian that it takes hold of the viewer and really causes him/her to think as he/she watches==that is, if the viewer is, in any way, a thinking individual.

So many reviewers have criticized the nudity in this show. Get over it. It's not gratuitous. It's not porn. People (often) take off their clothes when they engage in sex. (And it's not as if the women who bare their chests are unattractive.) But, after watching the second season, I have seen these little adventures for what they are: An attempt to better delve into each character's psyche and what it is that he/she hopes to achieve. In other words, there are reasons why each character that ""gets it on"" with another does so. It may not be obvious, at first, as one is watching all of the thrusting and groping. But it becomes clear later. And the impact would be so much lessened if all one were to see were two people going into a room/tent/whatever together and then emerging, later, all disheveled and dripping sweat. I suppose that if the sex offends you so much, then you shouldn't be watching contemporary cinema.

To sum it all up, this show deserves more than one quick watch. If what occurs seems dis-jointed or gratuitous or meaningless, then I would suggest that you watch it a second time. The acting, alone, is outstanding (contrary to what some reviewers have said).

The characters in this show are gritty. Though some are likable, many are hateful creatures. But even those characters that the viewer finds him- or herself despising play an important role in the story being told.

In short, if you find that the production seems meaningless to you the first time around, watch it a second time. I'm not saying this for sales purposes. I mean it. Watch it a second time. Everything begins to click into place; the plot becomes more meaningful; the characters' motives start to stand out more. But don't give up on this show just because you think its producers wanted to throw some R-rated porn at their audience. It's so much more historical than that. And enjoyable.",1421452800,3,2850,4.64484126984127

5886094,4,B00E1LSX44,"Great show.  I hope my review does not turn into a novel, but it might as I am typing. I'm not going to go into the whole porn sex or violence thing as other reviewers have already pointed out.  OK, so we know, it's not for kids and not family friendly.  OK Now onto season one:

I was impressed with this, even though I cringe BIG TIME when I see the name ""Michael Bay.""  Thank god he was not the director(s).

The Characters:

Captain Flint:  Paranoid, strong but weak too...what are his real motives besides getting wealthy and having control over the island and trying to be king of the island to rival established nations of the time?
John Silver:  Basically Jack Sparrow without the makeup, hair and tattoos. He even speaks and acts like Jack Sparrow in a lot of scenes and his motives are very similar.
Mr. Gates:  One of, if not my favorite character. Loyal, dependable, leader that keeps the crew happy and his capt. informed too. Very diplomatic guy.
Eleanor:  Hard to believe a young 20 something woman having so much control over a Bahamas island in 1715, but the actress did a good job. The pirates respect her as she is the only money controlling law in the island town.  But she has an alter ego too it seems.
Max:  An abused prostitute that has real feelings for those close around her. Will she survive?
Captain Charles Vane:  A stud who is the ultimate survivor and ""manly man"" who will see his way until the end.
Capt. (or is it quartermaster?) Jack Rackham:  Like Vane, a real pirate in real life.  His image here in this series is more of a dirty scumbag.  In real life he was apparently a Captain with two female pirates on board.  I will have to do some more research on him and his crew in real live and books that I thought I had already done on him again.
Anne Bonny:  The ""hiding behind the big hat one eyed"" ninja fighter.  I actually liked this portrayal of Anne Bonny as the history books always say she was a tomboy onboard.
Billy Bones: An honest, truthful sailor with a strong will and big arms to boot. A favorite character of mine in season one.
Singleton:  From episode 1 a badass scar faced dude pressing the crew for him to be the captain.
Mr. Scott:  Another huge favorite of mine. He knows what is going to happen in the near future when the Royal Navy and other rival navies and pirates come in to take over the island.  He tries his best to consult and let Eleanor know she is not in a winning situation at all, but he guides and tries to protect her business interests, as well as her life and well being.

Anyway, I can go on and on but that is it for now. I will probably revise this review later.  Oh, and for the only 4 instead of 5 stars?  I hate network and regular cable TV.  Is this going to try to be another TV show like ""Lost""  More questions than answers to prolong viewership and rip people off from constructive answers and endings?  Please don't play this game for money against us fans STARZ, have the show progress WITH SOME answers and some finalities and chapter closures and new assignments.  If you play the ""Lost"" game, you will be the one lost as no will watch after next season.  Good luck.",1421366400,2,3157,4.327086882453152

5886097,5,B00E1LSX44,"HOW TO UNDERSTAND THIS DARKER, GRITTIER PIRATE TALE, OR ASSESS IF ITS NOT FOR YOU

***WARNING TO THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SERIES*** This show has cinematic level production values, but also a great deal of adult content. This is the rum addled, opium hazed, violent and sexualized depiction one might expect of a more realistic (though still fantasy) pirate drama. It is understandable that it just won't fit everyones tastes. Please accept this attempt to explain the show so others can decide for themselves. There is a connection to the novel ""Treasure Island"" that is confusing people, but this IS NOT a children's tale. This program is also not all action for those hoping for sea battles in every episode. Those hoping for all action will find a substantial amount of focus on political struggle, drama, relationships and sub-plots. This is precisely the strength for those who seek it, and a weakness for those who don't wish to spend the time.

INTRO: It is truly amazing that for such a dark topic as pirating, there has hardly been a show that avoids the normal clichs and depicts a gritty life more like it would have been. We have always had these semi-sanitized versions meant for adventure telling and children's stories. Until now. This intricate tale borrows characters and places from Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island to form its structure and mythology, while starting 20 years earlier to set up the tale. Woven together with that is a few real characters based loosely on their actual history. From the opening credits featuring undulating strains of hurdy-gurdy music, camera panning over the intricate bone carved art piece shaped somewhat like the back of a sailing vessel - It is clear this is going to be a quality show with intricate plots and very dark undertones.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  John Silver is the weasily survivor who is aboard a vessel taken prize by the infamous pirate Captain Flint.  He is hiding below deck during the sea battle and chance offers him both an excuse to live, and a way to make himself useful to Flint and his crew (which he joins).  Flint is an educated, former privateer for England who has been declared enemy of humanity along with other privateers once the Crown no longer needs them.  They are the disinherited.  They are now pirates based out of Nassau on the Bahamian island of New Providence.  There is more to this Captain Flint than we realize, and that includes his ally and confidant beautiful Mrs Barlow who is clearly a lady.  Time will reveal her own dark secrets and the complicated relationship with the pirate captain Flint.  As Flint's relationship begrudgingly deepens with Silver, they will have to rely on each other at times for their very existence.  Ultimately Flint wishes to capture the prize of all prizes, the largest treasure galleon  under sail.  The Urca de Lima.  This prize will allow Flint to leave the life of pirating and protect those for whom he cares.  However, there is more to Flint's plan than he reveals to even his closest associates.  Also, despite the need for secrecy involving such a prize, he will need to rely on other crews and captains to take on such a powerful ship.  As they draw ever nearer to accomplishing their goal, Flint's closest friends (and enemies) are closing in on his dark secrets.

OUTSTANDING CHARACTER & STORY DEVELOPMENT:  The character development and complex storylines are part of what really carry this show.  Toby Stephens leads the cast as Captain Flint and displays the capability and charisma needed to inspire the support of a crew.  He also projects the vulnerability of someone who knows they can withdraw support at any time.  Eleanor Guthry is the foul mouthed, but oddly cultivated, daughter of the island fence (sells the stolen goods to more reputable markets on behalf of the pirates).  Behind it all, she is the one that makes it all work and is the real power on the island.  Clara Paget plays Ann Bonny (who was a real pirate), a kick butt female crew member of the formidable Captain Vane.  In the show she has a nearly mercenary/assassin like quality that is fascinating.  The political winds that must be channeled to control each ship, or the island power structure itself, are legion.  This is what really makes the story complex with tons of sub plots.  In the end, they create an amazing cast of humanized and deeply fleshed characters that are also some of the nastiest people to have ever sailed... ""Under the Black"".

FINAL THOUGHTS: Like some other sensationalized shows on STARZ, this is not a family show. It is not literal history as it is a historical fantasy after all. However, the historical elements they bring in, the monumental detail on ships and sets, character development and plot structure all add great flesh to a skeleton of real pirate history and literary reference. The emphasis on the oddly democratic counter-culture of pirate life, which contrasts the practice of conscription (forced servitude on sailing ships), is a key to understanding the psychology of pirates of that day. They were partly rebelling against this sea culture and ill treatment in real navies (plus the outlawing of privateers that served during wartime). If you are not offended by its darker side, and you appreciate complex story and character development at a literary level, you may discover something special in this show.",1421107200,82,5397,4.879518072289157

5886111,4,B00E1LSX44,"If you're familiar with the names of John Silver, Billy Bones and Captain Flint, then youll realize from the start that BLACK SAILS is a prequel to Robert Louis Stevensons TREASURE ISLAND, set in 1715, decades before young Jim Hawkins entered the picture or was even born.

Toby Stephens plays Flint, the most feared pirate captain of his day, Tom Hopper is Billy Bones, a senior member of his unhappy crew, while Luke Arnold plays the crafty ships cook, John Silver, who has his own nefarious agenda.

Much of the saga takes place on New Providence Island, a former British colony that is now lawless territory, controlled by several of the most ruthless pirates in history.  Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New), daughter of the local smuggling kingpin, actually runs the lucrative fencing operation on her fathers behalf.

BLACK SAILS, THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is filled with plenty of clandestine agreements, switched alliances and double crosses, as Flint and competing captains seek the location of a Spanish treasure ship containing a five million dollar bounty.

The handsomely mounted, colorful eight-episode series was filmed in South Africa and features a fine cast of talented players.  With a large amount of characters to introduce, the show does begin a bit slowly, but once it gets going, the narrative and action is totally engrossing.

Viewers who are turned off by violence, excessive profanity and blatant nudity should avoid the series, but all others are in for a exciting ride.

Anchor Bay Entertainment is releasing the Starz original series onto DVD in a 3-disc set.  The collection contains a half dozen Behind the Scenes featurettes.

5886112,3,B00E1LSX44,Typical pirate show. Breasts and gold. Though I think too much nudity takes away from the story. But so far it's okay.,1419552000,5,118,4.409090909090909
5886113,3,B00E1LSX44,"So I stumbled on Black Sails after recently discovering Toby Stephens and starting to follow some of his work. I want to like this show more, but as with many programs on premium cable channels (which I don't have, hence my buying Black Sails on Amazon) the gratuitous nudity did get on my nerves. I had read some reviews of the series beforehand so I was prepared for it and feel I am semi-tolerant, but as is par for the course with these things: 1) most of the time the nudity is clearly to titillate, and 2) almost every female character has been completely naked before even one male character. Needless to say they are obviously going for a more male dominated audience, but this is the kind of stuff that continues to bother me in today's media. Getting off my soapbox on women in media now.

On the plus side, after one episode I was hooked on the main title theme and was looking up the composer on YouTube. I can totally understand why it the main title theme was nominated for an Emmy. I continue to love the music and now I even know what a hurdy gurdy is. The set design is also amazing. I actually find myself looking at the details of the sets quite often and just love the details and use of color.

The acting is pretty good and I like the variety of characters, although I think because there are so many characters and no one gets a ton of screen time it is hard to say if there is any stand out performance from season 1. What becomes pretty evident is that the characters are all out for themselves, so plans and loyalties change frequently. I have to say, I was bummed to lose Tom Hopper's ""William 'Bones"" Manderly, I started to really enjoy him and was hoping he would somehow return, but Wikipedia seems to dashed those hopes for me.

Overall, it's a decent show. I will probably watch season 2 when it's available and see if there is enough to make me keep watching, It's just hard to say with the season one 8-episode run if it's worth continuing to watch as the characters are all being established and it wasn't quite clear to me what the overall theme was for the season. But I'm hooked on the music for sure, the hurdy gurdy and bodhran are my two new favorite instruments.",1419292800,41,2204,4.344660194174757
5886114,5,B00E1LSX44,"A HIGHLY enjoyable series. I can't wait for Season Two. I hope they keep up the excellent momentum from the first season! Great action, well-defined characters, and beautifully done scenery. Makes me wish I could go to sea again!",1419206400,,229,4.897435897435898
5886115,5,B00E1LSX44,"Not the story you read in school. Typical STARZ TV show with sex, nudity, violence and swearing. I have no problem with that if done well. I think that they have done a great job at providing a backstory to Stevenson's Treasure Island, while giving it a gritty real world look and feel. OF COURSE it is not real...its Fiction, and if you have a problem with any of the above you probably will not like it.

I have the BLU-RAY of Season One ( it was released at Best Buy for $24.99 on Tuesday Dec 16) and it looks GREAT! I do not have cable and had not seen the show before buying the Blu-Ray. Worth the price if you grew up watching pirate movies.

Again, if you have read any of the other reviews you know this is not ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or an Errol Flynn movie. If you liked HBO's ""Deadwood"" or even the Starz show ""Spartacus"", then you should enjoy this.

One CAVEAT, however...the Blu-ray set comes in a cardboard gatefold inside a slipcase. Like most cardboard cases it is inconvenient (for you! not for them because it is cheap to make), but UNLIKE most it does not give you much room to grab the discs. Only about 1/2 inch sticks out of each disc, making hard to even grab from top and bottom. Luckily Blu-ray don't scratch easily, but if you prefer to handle your discs by the edges or the hole in the middle I would suggest ditching the gatefold for a different case. Same suggestion if you expect to play them very often. The gatefold makes it tough to get them in and out. It has pictures of the cast (one per fold) but no info except Disc number and Episode 1, 2, 3 etc. and who wrote them. No info about the episodes...not even the name of it. Of course if you have seen it you know the names of the episodes ARE 1, 2, 3 etc.",1419033600,4,1745,4.1875
5886116,4,B00E1LSX44,"I was pleasantly surprised by Black Sails. I didn't expect the story line to be so strong and the filming and sets to bring such a feel for the period.

However, my reason for my 4 star rating is this:  If I can't understand the reason why a character is doing what they're doing, I have a difficult time believing the plot. And I'm having a difficult time understanding Capt. Flint's actions. I want more depth to him. Actually, I'd like a tiny bit more depth to all of the characters. It's like the writers are teasing us - giving us just enough to pull us in and wonder what the devil is going on, but not enough to understand the characters.

That being said, though, it's not going to stop me from watching season 2. Of course I want to see what happens in this loosely historical piece. And a ho ho ho and a bottle of rum to you!",1418947200,4,835,4.173913043478261

5886133,5,B00E1LSX44,"I hope there are many more to come.  This really goes into a lot of details of life of the era and issues sailors (and as an extension pirates) had to face, from ""not all cannons are created equal"", to ""there's a lot of guess work for if you can successfully chase someone down"", to the economy factor of moving stolen merchandise.

But all in all its the excitement.  There's action, and you don't know what's going to happen to any of the people!  Sure, there's a few you know make it out (if you've even heard of Treasure Island), and a few you know won't, but knowing someone ""won't die"" doesn't mean they won't have bad things happen to them!  So far in season 1, John Silver is starting to earn that crafty reputation for why everyone fears him!

I just wish the episodes were available as the show comes out, but such as life with ""premium cable channels"" and their marriage to cable companies.  5 years from now this would be a reason why I would subscribe to Starz.com, but for now, I have to hold out and wait for the next season to make its way to video.",1415059200,4,1065,4.268656716417911

Instead of building a grand adventure around the premise of events that take place prior to Treasure Island, this show seems intent on trying to out-smut Game of Thrones. Here is a word to the production team on this program. Those of us who enjoy stories of high adventure are willing to pay for them. We are not, necessarily, willing to pay to watch naked people pantomime lewd acts for an hour and call it a period drama.

5886212,4,B00E1LSX44,"I am very much enjoying these episodes. There aren't many films or shows about pirates, so I'm really super glad that Black Sails was created. I love the characters and the pirate-y world. The acting is great, there's a high production value, the sets are gorgeous, and the costumes are fun, although at times a little off (you've heard about the sunglasses I'm sure). It's a fun show! There are some quotes and actions that have me laughing out loud with glee, and moments of dark suspense that keep me on the edge of my seat.

But I do have a couple of problems which detract from the enjoyment:

1. The lavish use of the F-word. I have no qualms with curses when used effectively, but it is used excessively to the point of it being ridiculous - especially from Eleanor Guthrie, who uses the word like a child who has heard adults using it, and is repeating it without understanding or conviction. It doesn't make her look tough - it makes her look stupid, weak, and unbelievable. But it is also used excessively by most of the characters. It's not even that the F-word wasn't used that way in the 1700's (from all accounts), but that it is just used so many times that it takes me out of the moment and ""dumbs down"" the dialogue. I am hoping that they give it a break in season 2.

2. The gratuitous sex and nudity, which is annoying but has become so present in modern entertainment that I just have to sort of glaze over those scenes. When will the industry realize that sex scenes are not really sexy? Leaving things to the imagination would be much better.

That being said, I really like the show and hope to see many future seasons.

5886223,4,B00E1LSX44,"This is one of the pilots that Amazon will hopefully green light. Seems well made and genuinely entertaining. Time will tell how realistic it is.

5886224,5,B00E1LSX44,"It seems as if Black Sails was critically dismissed by some for being a 'Starz' show, written off as another parade of gore and naked flesh masquerading as historical drama, using the same gratuitous formula that worked so well for 'Spartacus'. But 'Black Sails' demonstrated in it's short, 8-episode first season that it was something different. The production design, for one thing, relied less on CGI backgrounds, and it's tropical sets were constructed in an authentic manner that indicated the showrunners were aiming more toward 'Rome' than 'Spartacus'. The writing was excellent from start to finish, delving into the less obvious specifics of pirate life, while building a complex web of relationships and loyalties that formed a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island'.

The various characters, some new and some familiar, are portrayed by one of the strongest and most charismatic casts since 'Game of Thrones'. The famous Captain Flint takes center stage, obsessed with a dangerous plan to take down a Spanish Galleon transporting wealth beyond a pirate's dreams. Toby Stephens plays Flint with the right blend of enigmatic intelligence and tough, stubborn determination. His rival for the spoils to be found in the waters around New Providence Island, Captain Charles Vane, is played by Zach McGowan with a silent menace. In an interesting melding of fiction and history, Vane was a real life figure from the golden age of piracy, and the man who eventually deposed him, the cunning 'Calico' Jack Rackham, is played to perfection by Toby Schmitz. One of several talented Australians in the cast (including Luke Arnold in a pivotal role as John Silver), Schmitz presents Rackham as a calculating but loyal right hand man to Vane, often required to do the thinking for both of them. Rackham is perhaps the most iconic pirate in history; the ubiquitous Jolly Roger flag, as famous as 'Old Glory' and older, was his design. He was also famous for having two female crewmates, one of which, his lover Anne Bonny, appears in Black Sails.

The competition between the real and fictional pirate crews adds a post-modern meta-narrative twist to the excellent scripting, but knowledge of that aspect, the history, or Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel, is not at all necessary to appreciate this series. A second season was greenlit on the strength of the pilot alone, so hopefully a 13-episode run and a bigger budget, combined with wider promotional support, will keep this series from getting sunk by Crossbones.",1403481600,2,2535,5.150485436893204

There's not a lot of Piratey ship action, instead it's pirate politics and infighting.

5886245,5,B00E1LSX44,"Well everything you heard was true this is just rollicking good fun. Designed to be a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's `Treasure Island' this show takes real pirates and some fictional ones and throws them into a bawdy mix of greed, lust, jealousy, violence and pirate folklore. Real pirates include Anne Bony, Charles Vane and Benjamin Hornigold - their real stories are explosive enough but this adds to the fun.

The plot is centred around the pirate stronghold of New Providence Island, where Captain Flint is trying to broaden his power base by biting off more than he can chew by capturing the prize of the biggest Spanish Galleon `Urca de Lima'. The island is run by the daughter of the corrupt governor and she has a taste for power, money, men and yes ladies too! We also have John Silver and a more sly opportunist would be hard to come across even on such a lawless island.

Then there is the Royal Navy, the shenanigans of the local brothel and bawdy house, double deals a-plenty and more swashes than you could buckle in a life time (probably). This is a full grown up `Pirates of the Caribbean' with all the filth and bedroom action thrown in to make it both believable and modern enough to cater for a spoilt twenty first century palate.

The actors are all universally brilliant as are the sets and attention to detail. It is hard to single out any for individual praise but here goes; Toby Stephens as Flint and Toby Schmitz as the wonderful rake Rackham are just excellent. We all know this has gone down so well that a second ten episode run is already in the pipeline and if that is not enough to shiver your timbers then you are truly hard to please - absolutely ruddy excellent.",1397520000,2,1703,4.54071661237785

Now, this came along just as I'm engrossed in Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag, and the two together have completely reignited by boyhood love for these scurvy dogs (re-reading ""Treasure Island,"" tearing through books like David Cordingly's excellent ""Under the Black Flag"" and Richard Sanders' equally cool ""If a Pirate I Must Be"").  The point is I may not be the most impartial reviewer.  And one can't very well judge a whole season from the first episode that really is just setting up plot threads and introducing characters (""Oh, OK, that's the protagonist?""  ""Ooh, she's got a filthy mouth on her.""  ""My, that fella's very punchy with the fists.""), but it's a well done bit of fun.  The atmosphere makes you feel appropriately salty, dusty and grimy.  The actors so far seem super cool (if I could get away with growing a sweet twisty mustache and dressing like Cpt. Flint at work, I would).  Jessica Parker Kennedy and Hannah New are ridiculously hot.  I also love that they're mixing in fictional characters from ""Treasure Island"" with real-life hoodlums like Calico Jack and Charles Vane.  And I'm not an expert at all, but it looks accurate enough historically (from what little I've read on the subject), minus some poetic liberties that can be expected from this sort of thing.  Needless to say, yes, I am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the season, and I think anyone who dug ""Spartacus"" on Starz, or ne'er do wells doing dirty deeds...or as a kid wanted to jump off the Disney ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride and just hang out there...will dig this.",1396396800,,1685,4.759450171821306

Sex and nudity are fine if they contribute something to the story. That's not the case here. It's as if they knew the show was weak and threw in sex/nudity every time the story was going nowhere (which is very often) in the hope that it would distract the viewers from how terrible this show really is. The first episode was extremely disappointing and certainly didn't leave me with the feeling that if I give the show a chance and keep watching, it may get better.

The reproductions of the ship, the clothes, the attitudes (especially those!) is phenomenal. The story takes place in and around Nassau, but was shot on location in Cape Town, South Africa. No loss of realism there, though.

The story has nudity, violence, bad words, horrid deeds, but they all come together, showing pirates in a new perspective. I never knew they had such an intolerance for lying and theft. This isn't your Pirates of the Caribbean story, for sure!

I had high hopes for this but it's just too cheesy and I'm at a loss to explain how it received so many good reviews, but such is the way with many popular things these days.

It seemed as good a time as any to green-light a television show based on the subject, and as someone who loved playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monkey-Island/dp/B005CLPO1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monkey Island</a>&nbsp;as a child, I definitely had my interest piqued by early promos.

""Black Sails"" tries to cover all its bases when it comes to what exactly it's trying to be: partly a ""Treasure Island"" prequel featuring the likes of Captain Flint and John Silver, partly a quasi-historical drama featuring real-life figures such as Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, and partly an original story involving entirely new characters. Throw in a surprising amount of world-building that explores the finer nuances of pirating (such as where they off-load their stolen wares, the rivalries that exist between ships, the constant risk of mutinies) and a delicate balancing act between the glamour of pirate life and the gruesome, sordid reality of it, and you end up with a show that seems a worthy successor to Starz's previous hit:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus/dp/B004HW7JMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus</a>. And yes, before you ask - there's still plenty of gore, violence and nudity.

It's 1715 and the West Indies are a hot-bed of piracy. It's on New Providence Island that they bring their stolen cargo, to be sold to the (somewhat) respectable Guthrie family who then sell it on through the black market. It's a lucrative business for everyone involved, though their way of life is now at a crossroads. The British Empire is closing in on piracy and the Guthrie patriarch is ready to throw in the towel - much to the fury of his daughter Eleanor. She's desperate to hold onto a position that allows her power and authority, and it's in the frankly outrageous scheme of Captain Flint that she sees a way of keeping her world intact.

Flint is the captain of the Walrus, barely holding his crew together against the threat of mutiny after so many months of slim pickings. What the crew doesn't know is that Flint is after a particular schedule, one that will lead them to a Spanish galleon that carries a fortune beyond imagining. It's enough to stabilize their way of life and sate Flint's dizzying egocentrism - if they can get the funding, firepower, and crew they need to pull it off.

But there's a spanner in the works. John Silver (the man who will eventually be Long-John Silver of ""Treasure Island"" fame) manages by sheer chance to get his hands on the schedule before the pirates do. Seeing an opportunity, he slithers his way into their good graces in a way that makes Captain Jack Sparrow's gift of dissembling look like child's play.

Amidst the extensive ensemble cast it's these three characters that could fairly be called the protagonists, those there's plenty more to go around.  With a large cast, the show's most noteworthy feature is its ability to juggle a wide variety of characters and their dizzying array of agendas. People are motivated by greed, fear - even unselfish love, and the network of opposing factions and strategies make for a slow-burning series of plots, counterplots, blindsides, betrayals and skirmishes.

The production values are sky-high, with special effects and camera-work that you'd expect from a movie. Yet because of what would no doubt be the massive budgetary concerns of filming at sea, most of the series is ""land-locked"" on Providence Island, dealing with the scheming and back-stabbing that goes on throughout the island. Everything that happens does so for a reason, and in true&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00AB55BS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;fashion, you're never quite sure whose side to be on. Sometimes what passes for the ""good guys"" act in ways that frustrate the plot for the best of intentions; sometimes the antagonists manage things so unbelievably clever that you can't but help cheer them on.

At the center of this maelstrom is Captain James Flint, and in many ways he's best described as a deconstruction of Captain Jack Sparrow of the Disney films. Both are stubborn, single-minded, delusional megalomaniacs. But whereas Jack Sparrow spun those qualities into a series of quirky adventures over the course of several Disney films (PG films, but still Disney films), Flint operates within a more accurate rendering of the real world. There his magnetism and drive are in equal parts inspiring and terrifying. He clings to situations by the skin of his teeth, lying and cheating and desperately trying to keep one step ahead. One part of you wants to see him succeed against the impossible odds set against him; the other will constantly think that he's going too far in his quest for wealth.

Toby Stevens plays Flint with a gentlemanly roguishness and enough self-important bluster to make an audience believe that he could pull off such an impossible coup. Hannah New is Eleanor - perhaps a little too clean and coiffed to pass as a woman living in such conditions, but (like Flint) struggling to maintain a front of breezy confidence in order to hide how brittle she is beneath. Female viewers will enjoy the biceps of Billy Bones (Tom Hopper, in a role that gives him far more lines than on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00C4UR3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>), and fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-of-Sherwood/dp/B00180IPQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin of Sherwood</a>&nbsp;back in the eighties will be astonished to recognized a rather more rotund Mark Ryan (who played Nasir) as Flint's right-hand man Gates. Toby Schmitz and Clara Paget almost steal the show as bickering but surprisingly affectionate lovers/pirates Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, whilst Zach McGowan is the closest thing the show has to a true villain: violent, vicious and obsessed with Eleanor.

Those familiar with Robert Louis Stevenson's novel ""Treasure Island"" will smile to see various threads being pulled together: a character called Billy Bones, the affinity John Silver has with a cook, the fate the crew has in store for Flint once the treasure has been won, and it all ends on a satisfying note that leaves you eager for season two.

If you can handle the violence, nudity, language and gore then there's no reason not to enjoy ""Black Sails"". With only eight episodes in which to tell its story, it manages to pack in a huge amount of plot, character development and world-building, presenting a side to piracy that's seldom seen: the politics, the technicalities, and the trust that was necessary between crew-members.",1394841600,,7864,6.050269299820466

I would suggest that the makers of the series tone down the foul language though.  It seems like every minute someone is using the ""F"" word, even the ladies, and it kind of turns me off.  I mean, it's reminding me of all the foul language from Deadwood.  No one curses that much in those times, and it seems out of place in this era as well.  It has a good cast, good scenery, and excellent costumes.  But remember, story is king!  And so far the story is intriguing.  But try and make the dialogue a bit more realistic by limiting all the cursing going on.  And also, hopefully in the next season they will have a better opening music theme.  The one they have now is actually a bit irritating and tinny.  It doesn't have that sweeping epic feel to it, that a full orchestra can convey.",1394582400,,901,4.272189349112426

Well written and with excellent production and acting, the series weaves a tale combining historical facts, real people, and known fictional characters. (They did their homework!)

A haunting introduction and a riveting score.  Everything is well-done.  A lot of care has been put into this show.

The writing is tight, the dialogue is convincing, and the plot twists in ways you might not expect.  No one is altogether good or bad in this series, which makes sense considering we are dealing with pirates here.  But the characterization is such that you will feel dirty for rooting for some characters and curious that you are rooting for others.  Incredibly dark and conflicted characters abound here.  There is only one truly ""good"" character so far, and I think he might be dead.

The history of pirates and privateers is truly brought to life.  Incredibly violent life.  So far I have seen the brutal, painful truth of warfare at sea.  The bloody boardings.  The cannonballs crashing through ship and crew alike, smashing both to pieces.  Murder, rape, a man's throat bitten open--it's all in there.  When this series brings the action, it brings it in a BIG way.  When it displays the lack of humanity in charcters, it does so in a big, revolting way.

The show is a perfect storm of action, mystery, drama, and thrills set in a world we have not seen presented this well EVER.

There was much hype and anticipation leading up to this show.  The timing of this topic, being a pirate series, couldn't be more sound.  We have had Pirates of the Caribbean which was cute and funny, and Assassin's Creed Black Flag which was also a hit and perfectly timed.  Both very entertaining and successful and currently remain standing on both feet.  The very idea of allowing the first episode of Black Sails being freely viewable to the public was a colossally brilliant idea. BUT... The first episode, which was meant to grab my interest and enthusiasm, ultimately disappointed me.  The unfortunate thing about this is that I realize that it will probably get better as the series progresses, but ya can't throw away the first episode.  That's your sales pitch.  Otherwise, why have a first free episode.  That idea may have backfired.  Like Hells on Wheels, I haven't watched it since it first released because it failed to captivate me in the beginning.  As for the technical merits of Black Sails, it has been handled with care.  Casting is fresh and precise. The environment has been captured successfully and the writing is something of note.  Without spoiling anything the show closed well.  If you're a big fan of pirates, you will probably convince yourself that its better than it really is.  I wouldn't mind watching the remainder of the season, but all things considered, I'm not yet willing to give Starz my my hard-earned dollars for a show that threw away the first round of a long fight.",1393286400,,1673,4.838028169014085
5886299,5,B00E1LSX44,I loved the pilot.  I will buy the show when it's available digitally.

Lots of eye candy with perfect teeth and rippling muscles for the gals and curves for the gents. I wanted to like the show, but it lacks the style and grit of Spartacus. More importantly, none of the characters were interesting except maybe the first mate.",1392422400,9,377,4.90625
5886312,2,B00E1LSX44,"The first episode was a bit disappointing. The story in the first episode and the characters seemed flat for the most part. Flint and Hannah New's character especially seem less then they could be. So much so that i feel that  perhaps the actors for Gates and Flint should of swapped roles Gates just seemed to have far more depth . That and the fight scene at the end was poorly executed, a child with a stick could of probably beaten both of them, flint with his hands out in front of him and the scarred fellow with those couple of wide open little quarter thrusts was hilarious to watch. I'm pretty sure any harden pirate from those times would of killed flint before following him treasure map or not after watching that fight.

Though the premise still is interesting and it wouldn't be the first show that was great after a bad pilot episode. So where is the second episode amazon? the first episode was weeks ago now.",1392336000,,925,4.4674556213017755

With it being on Starz, it allows for a much more realistic depiction of the golden age of piracy vs. the famous Disney movies. They may have been thieves but the British Empire wasn't completely pious either. I'd rather root for ""Calico"" Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, vs. the corrupt government officials of Britain and Spain. I'd rather sail under the Black Flag any day. 5Stars, strongly recommend.

They tend to kill shows that are good and not teen slanted. The double dealing and lying to get ahead is part of the pirate code take no prisoners. This will be a show that we who love pirate's can stand by. Hoist the sails and don't spare the blood boys arrrrr and may your compass point north.,1392163200,2,415,3.8941176470588235

The show is filmed in South Africa, which is beautiful; but takes place in the Bahamas. The characters are a good mix of fictional and historical. I looked up Captain Charles Vane, for instance, after seeing the show and he really was one of the worst, most cruel and murderous pirates of that day. Anne Bonny also is was a real person. Flint and John Silver are lifted from the book ""Treasure Island"".

5886334,5,B00E1LSX44,"I had been impatiently waiting for this series to premiere, and after it finally did and watching the very first episode I am amazed, no actually stunned at how great this series is going to be. the second episode was just as great so I can already say this is very good and I will be buying this when it comes to dvd. I was a huge huge fan of the series spartacus, and was sad to see it come to an end, after that I figured there would never be a show as good as that or one that could compare, they tried with da vincis demons but idk I just couldn't get iinto that show, this one on the other hand is the only one that will be able to compare to spartacus. I am so happy that there is finally an adult series about pirates, I love the whole feel of the setting, the actors are perfect for the roles, and everything so far is just very well done. for those reviewing this saying that its nothing but porn and boreing, if you watch a lot of other big hit shows on stations like starz , hbo, cinemax, showtime, you will notice they are all very adult oriented in terms of nudity sex and overall adult content, they all have that idk how to put it, feel to them because of that and the way they make the show, and its something i very much enjoy. this show is about pirates but its not all sword fighting plundering and whatnot, theres charachter development and an actual plot, and its more about the hardships they people back in that time went through, like it shows a different side to pirates of that time than is normally seen in mainstream movies and such. anyways, i think i have said enough, this show is the best since spartacus, and cant recommend it enough. cant wait for dvd, and I hope it gets several seasons like spartacus did.",1391299200,2,1742,4.172106824925816

5886336,5,B00E1LSX44,"Show Summary: 1715. The Golden Age of Piracy. New Providence Island is a lawless territory, controlled by historys most notorious pirate captain. The most feared is Captain Flint.

As the British Navy returns to redeem their land and exterminate Flint and his crew, another side of him emerges. Captain Flint aligns himself with Eleanor Guthrie, daughter of the local kingpin, to hunt the ultimate prize and ensure their survival.

Many opponents stand in their way: rival captains, jealous of Flints power; Eleanors ambitious and intrusive father; and a young sailor recently recruited onto Flints crew, John Silver, who constantly undermines his captains agenda.

We are very big Pirate movie fans. We have been playing Assassin's Creed Black Flag and love that game, And now we have this lovely Black Sails series.
Black Sails Is an Awesome Pirate Series, we hope to be able to stream the entire Seasons on our X-Box One systems. Some times new shows like this can take up to six month to two years before you can stream it. We do hope that Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video will be providing every season of Black Sails.",1391299200,,1128,4.895287958115183
5886337,4,B00E1LSX44,"This is as close as one can get to a realistic pirate show, and infinetly better than pirates of the Caribbean. At least they try to make Nassau as it was during the early 18th century... a tent awning city. In real life it would have looked a bit more rustic, however. This, of course, wouldn't make the most exciting set for a story, so they added lots of houses, taverns and mansions. I would argue that the real city would have been more fun, if nothing else, for realism. Also, the people would have been much dirtier and lots more ugly, especially the women. No supermodel wenches, no clean bright clothes save for a select few merchantmen and pirates. But a fun show. The one thing that irks my crack is they keep using ""F***"" repeatedly. That word wasn't used until around the civil war 140+ years later, and then only to describe the action of copulation, and not using it as profanity per-se.",1391299200,,902,4.472727272727273

There were far to many introductions to many stories they tried to start for one single episode. My biggest complaint is that STARZ went from the amazingly handsome and desirable characters of Spartacus to this. Obviously they were not trying to appeal to the eyes of the beholder. This seemed to be the same failings that the series Camelot had. Beautiful scenery, potentially intriguing storyline, amazing costumes, but really bad casting of actors for the parts.",1390780800,3,612,4.894230769230769

5886357,5,B00E1LSX44,"If the pilot is any indication, ""Black Sails"" will be a very well-acted, visually stunning, and very gritty telling of the origins of some of the characters in Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" and the unvarnished life of piracy.

If you are expecting the charm of Pirates of the Caribbean with a roguish Captain Jack Sparrow, this is not it. What you get in Toby Stephens' Captain Flint is a hard business man fighting for his survival and who believes he is the pirates salvation. His speech to Billy Bones delcaring himself as ""king"" of the pirates is short, but intense. Gates, basically Flint's second in command and confidante, is the person behind the scenes who makes things happen and is loyal to Flint -- his character seems the most balanced.

When you look at the world Flint inhabits, it is a world where death can come from enemies or ""friends"", and the women are just as tough and well-rounded as the men. It is a world of survival where money and sex can get you what you want or need.

The pilot is set about 20 years before ""Treasure Island"", so John Silver and Billy Bones are still young and not yet the characters we know from the book. But it is obvious that this young John Silver is a survivor and clever. Billy Bones is a giant of a man who seems to be clueless, but tries to figure out where he fits in.

A very rousing and raw take on the age of pirates.",1390608000,48,1390,4.396887159533074
5886358,5,B00E1LSX44,"I watched this with my step-father, a lover of all things related to the Age of Sail. I had a few trepidations, remembering the grit,gore nudity and language of Spartacus and my old man, while not a prude, is of a different generation. At the same time, I wanted an interesting portrayal of a way of life that was most likely not filled with saints and Sunday school teachers. Both of us got our wish because Starz has managed to balance the grit and the drama with great historical research and intriguing characters.

So far, I haven't managed to catch everyone's (or indeed anyone's) name, but their roles as the Captain, the first mate, the muscle, the Schemer, the daughter who should have been a son, the Maid who is smarter than her mistress were all clear and different enough from the stereotypical to be interesting. I can't wait to see what they do with women in the series as there were several famous women pirates known to history and some workaday women pirates who are lost in the mists of time. In a time and place rebelling against the social structure, it makes sense that gender roles would break down some as well and it will be interesting to see how Starz handles this.

On the shallow side, the actors and actresses are all gorgeous and there is pretty for every taste and orientation. The costumes and sets are amazing as well. So far a show both fun and dramatic. I will update this review more thoroughly at the end of the season. My recommendation at the moment is watch, watch and watch, even if you have to subscribe to Starz. I think this may be the show Starz has been working towards and will keep you entertained while we wait for Season 4 of Game of Thrones.",1390521600,82,1693,4.475728155339806

If anyone has played Assassin's Creed 4, you'll be amazed at the historical accuracy the two media share. The acting is good, the special effects are awesome, and you feel as though you're in the Caribbean. Storyline is also very suspenseful and keeps you on your toes. A refreshing show with plenty of action and drama.",1390262400,3,393,4.880597014925373
