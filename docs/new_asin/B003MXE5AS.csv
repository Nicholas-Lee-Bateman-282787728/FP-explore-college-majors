4156311,3,B003MXE5AS,Ive seen these episodes on tv and liked them. Decided to buy the dvd and noticed there were a few missing scenes from the show. Plays good but did not like what they did taking stuff out. They shouldve added more or added a few extras but overall OK.,1355097600,6,250,4.122448979591836
4156312,5,B003MXE5AS,"Awesome. Such a funny show. Nice extra feature, too. My 7 year old loves this, and we enjoy watching it with her. 3 or 4 episodes.",1349827200,2,130,4.038461538461538
4156313,5,B003MXE5AS,"I happened to be flipping through the channels late one night and came across Wizards of Waverly Place. I new the show existed, but I never tried watching because I don't care today's kids series. After watching a few minutes I was hooked.

The episodes on the DVD are:

Wizards VS. Vampires on Waverly Place
Wizards VS. Vampires: Tasty Bites
Wizards VS. Vampires: Dream Date
Wizards VS. Vampires VS Zombies

The problem I have with Disney releasing the series to DVD is that they never release full seasons. Typically, they release four to five episodes on DVD at a low price, which can make a great birthday or Christmas gift.

In this release, we get to see Justin get girlfriend, who happens to be an ancient Vampire, and we get to invited to an anti-zombie prom. Wizards vs. Vampires is a little pricey on Amazon, but the Disney Movie Club has it a lot cheaper.",1345766400,10,866,4.567741935483871

8400539,5,B003MXE5AS,"Wizards of Waverly Place along with Good Luck Charlie and I Didn't Do It was one of Disney Channel last TV series before the network went down hill. This DVD release got released through Disney Movie Club. Glad I bought it used at a cheap price instead of paying a ridiculous price.
This set includes 4 episodes from season 3:
1. ""Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place""
2. ""Wizards vs. Vampires: Tasty Bites""
3. ""Wizards vs. Vampires: Dream Date""
4. ""Wizards & Vampires vs. Zombies""

Language: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese
Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1

5 star for the show but 2.5 star for the DVD release because Disney could have done a better job for this release instead it feels like they didn't put any effort. They could have included 3 more episodes (might as well use the whole disc capacity) or at least some bonus features. The picture quality is not the best. For a 2010 release Disney really messed up for not releasing this in widescreen but I'm not surprise since season 1-3 over at iTunes aren't the best picture quality either.",1466380800,,1044,4.699453551912568
