8276681,5,B001AD1NCU,Fantastic stylized art house film from the early 60s. Arlene Martel is captivating in the lead role. She was one of the most versatile actresses of her time.,1447027200,2,157,4.642857142857143
8276682,5,B001AD1NCU,"This is one of those great ""lost"" experimental films from the 1960's.  The film was held up in litigation, ala SPIDER BABY, and received scant distribution.  It's a wonderful black-and-white psychodrama about a troubled young woman and her strange sister.  The film really pushes the envelope in terms of the cinematography, with some wonderfully bizarre camera angles and then-experimental techniques such as a hand-held camera and other devices.  The mystery is entertaining, even if you see the surprise ending coming.  Elisha Cook, Jr. gets a great cameo as the sinister father, and Arline Sax (aka Arlene Martell) is excellent as both of the sisters.  John Hoyt, who stars as a detective, was one of the film's producers and was unfortunately embroiled in the lawsuit regarding the picture.  If you love low-budget, experimental 1960's films, this one is highly  recommended.  It's a shame that it isn't better known today, and deserves to be ranked with SPIDER BABY, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, WHO KILLED TEDDY BEAR, and NIGHT TIDE in the pantheon of great low-budget sixties genre productions.",1274227200,6,1092,5.194285714285714
