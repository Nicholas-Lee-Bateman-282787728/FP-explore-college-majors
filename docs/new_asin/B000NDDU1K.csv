2765797,5,B000NDDU1K,"THE FILM: ""Lisa"", one of the best drama films of the early 1960s, is the American title of the 1962 British film ""The Inspector"", which was based on the novel of the same name by Dutch writer Jan De Hartog and is set in 1946. Post-war Europe is in turmoil and packed with refugees and Peter Jongman (Stephen Boyd), a Dutch police inspector tortured by his failure to prevent his late fiancee Rachel Gerhardt being thrown into a Nazi concentration camp, follows Thorens (Marius Goring) a Nazi white slaver, to London. Thorens specialises in luring homeless girls out of Holland with the promise of a better life, only to find that they end up in a South American brothel.

Peter saves a Jewish girl, Lisa Held (Dolores Hart), who strongly resembles Rachel, from Thorens, but in a fight accidentally kills the Nazi. Lisa, a rare survivor of the medical experimentation block at Auschwitz, has one abiding aim...to get to Palestine, which was then being blockaded by the British. To try and atone for his failure to save Rachel from a Nazi death camp, Peter, knowing it will mean imprisonment for him and the end of his police career if he is caught, gives Lisa his word that he will help her get to Palestine. Then follows a chase across Europe to north Africa and the Middle East, with the police and the authorities hot on their trail...

""Lisa"" / ""The Inspector"" is a wonderful film, superbly acted; directed and photographed in CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe, with beautiful location photography (especially of the canals; barges and windmills of Holland) and with one of Malcolm Arnold's very best and most haunting scores. I have fond memories of showing it at the cinema where I worked as a projectionist in 1962 and I highly recommend it to all those who have never seen it.

It's incredible to realise how long ago this film was actually made (filmed in the summer of 1961) and that all the cast and crew, with the exception of Dolores Hart, have now passed on. This was Dolores' favourite film of all those she made during her screen career. It was also her penultimate film. She made one more film after this and then went into a convent and took her vows as a nun and, now being known as Mother Dolores, is an old lady of 75, who bears no facial likeness to her 1961 self as seen in this film.

THE FOX CINEMA ARCHIVES DVD-R: Fox Cinema Archives have deservedly come in for a lot of criticism lately for releasing their old CinemaScope films in the now totally obsolete pan and scan format, when they actually have the widescreen masters at hand and have already issued the films on widescreen DVDs in the UK and Europe. However, ""Lisa"" / ""The Inspector"" is an exception. It is 4 x 3 letterbox format (not 16 x 9 anamorphically enhanced) and, although the aspect ratio on this transfer is more like 2.20:1 instead of 2.35:1, in effect, cropping the sides of the image slightly, the image itself is clear and bright and the colours are vivid. The sound is also loud and clear, making Malcolm Arnold's score sound really wonderful. It will certainly do until a 16 x 9, 2.35:1 DVD is issued...if it ever is.",1363996800,5,3116,4.578853046594982
2765798,4,B000NDDU1K,"I saw ""Lisa"" exactly one time, many decades ago, when I was a kid. I watched it on a black and white TV, late at night, interrupted by many annoying commercials. I've never forgotten ""Lisa"": Dolores Hart played a Holocaust survivor determined, by any means necessary, to get to Palestine at a time when the British were interdicting such arrivals. Ruggedly handsome Stephen Boyd was Inspector Jongman. He began by hindering Lisa's pilgrimage and ended up helping her. For comic relief, there was Hugh Griffith, a smuggler who used a tennis racket in his ongoing battle with the bats that invaded his exotic Tangiers apartment at dusk.

Most importantly, I never shook the feeling that the film aroused in me - this film literally made me sick, and terrified, but it also moved and inspired me.

In the intervening years, I read somewhere that ""Lisa"" was an early attempt to depict the Holocaust in a mainstream Hollywood movie. That just increased my curiosity. Some kind soul has finally posted ""Lisa"" on youtube and I watched it there.

The title sequence appears over train tracks, rushing rapidly beneath the camera. This allusion to trains rushing to concentration camps felt heavy-handed. The film opens in 1946. Lisa is the pouty, passive cargo of a Nazi white slaver. There's some implausible cloak and dagger stuff - the daggers are SS, engraved ""blood and honor"" - and for sale by the Nazi white slaver, a villain with obviously dyed blonde hair and an obviously fake German accent. The Nazi dies; Lisa escapes via a fire escape; investigators suspect that Inspector Jongman murdered the Nazi. The chase / road movie is on. Lisa and Jongman begin a cat-and-mouse odyssey, via Dutch canal barge and smuggler ship, to Palestine.

After my decades-long wait to see ""Lisa"" again, these opening scenes disappointed me. I thought, ""Gee, we've come a long way since 1962. This ain't no ""Schindler's List."" Lisa is merely an object. The Nazi controls her; the good Dutch man wants her. She volunteered to go with the Nazi, stupidly falling for his lie that he would smuggle her to Palestine. And Lisa is obviously NOT Jewish. Dolores Hart was famously Catholic; she's got bright blue eyes and blond hair. English, Irish, and American actors try, or don't, to speak with slipping and sliding Dutch, German, or Arabic accents.

Lisa is a survivor of medical experimentation at Auschwitz. She had been used ""like a cadaver"" in gynecological training. Jongman wants to help Lisa because he had failed to help Rachel, his Jewish fiancee. The Holocaust is translated from genocide into a titillating morals charge or the plot twist in a risque romance novel. Though the center of this crime against women is a woman, Lisa, the film is really all about the men around her: Jongman, the Nazi, the police chasing them, the colorful smugglers aiding them, exploiting them, or ripping them off.

I kept watching, though, and in spite of all the problems, I rediscovered the movie that had so moved me years ago. Lisa's blondeness adds to the horror, in the same way that Jeanne Crain's whiteness added to the impact of ""Pinky."" Casting a white woman as a victim of Jim Crow, or a Catholic as a Jew, emphasizes that there is no logic nor justice to racism. We humans really ARE one race, and none of us can rely on our putative racial identity, or our physical features, for immunity.

As Bowsley Crowther pointed out in his New York Times review, the film's ""lurid"" advertisements are not representational of the film's ""decent"" and ""asexual"" content. In any case, Lisa's intimate victimization, and her literal sterility, economically and powerfully communicate the Nazis' sadism and nihilism.

There is a scene in this movie that I have never forgotten. Though, in the intervening years, I've seen too much graphic violence, I was afraid to re-watch this scene. Lisa describes how she was used as a medical display. In her flashback, all you see is what Lisa saw: the overheard medical lamps, and doctors' eyes staring at her clinically, as if she were, indeed, a cadaver. Lisa concludes her flashback by saying, ""I wanted to say to them, we are people, we are human beings."" The scene includes no special effects. It is one of the most high-impact Holocaust scenes, or depictions of dehumanization, that I've ever seen.

Lisa has been betrayed by the world. She survives by telling herself that Palestine is that somewhere-over-the-rainbow that can restore her will to live. Her goal and her intensity are palpable, both poignant and steely.

Dolores Hart is something to behold. She radiates rare beauty and depth. She and Boyd develop genuine chemistry; you come to care about their fate. Robert Stephens, in a small part as an Englishman who is, alternately, oafish, cloying, threatening, and moving, punctuates the final act of the film. There is an ideological smuggler, Brown, who wants to use Lisa to his own purposes; this subplot underlines how sometimes the highest ideals can inspire exploitative behavior. The theme of noble sacrifice is believable and moving.

""Lisa"" is based on Jan de Hartog's novel. He was the son of a Dutch minister and a convert to Quakerism. As a child he ran away, and lived on barges. During the war he aided in the hiding of Jewish babies; he hid from the Nazis disguised as a woman. Dolores Hart, who plays Lisa, left Hollywood at the height of her career to become a cloistered nun.",1273968000,15,5418,4.871878393051031
2765799,4,B000NDDU1K,"Lisa is the poignant drama of a Dutch Jewish girl who is trying to escape to Lebanon and finds herself in the clutches of an ex-Nazi who is also white slaver. Rescued by a cop with a guilty conscience, the police officer vows to help her escape to Lebanon.

This was a fascinating drama with an interesting cast, and some surprising plot twists. I was engrossed from start to finish, and the scenery and acting well done. The ending I felt was a tad abrupt and could've been a bit better. Overall, this was a great film.",1253836800,11,520,4.360824742268041
2765800,5,B000NDDU1K,"I saw ""Lisa"" many years ago and forgot both the name of the movie and the stars, but I never forgot the emotional impact of the story. Today I stumbled across it on TV and watched it again, finding the same emotional impact. We must never let the world forget the Holocaust and the survivors all have a story that is important for us to remember. Palestine and its beginnings are part of this story.",1253836800,10,399,4.333333333333333
2765801,5,B000NDDU1K,"I first saw this film many years ago when I was a teenager and instantly fell in love with it. Over the years it could be seen on tv quite frequently but then as so often happens the powers that be stopped making it available.
As the film begins we see Stephen Boyd's charactor hunting Lisa as though she were some sort of criminal, but then the unthinkable happens and he begins to see how deeply she longs to return to her homeland and begins a long and illegal journey with her to make her dream come true making himself a wanted man himself in the process.
I don't want to give away what happens but suffice it to say that as the story progresses the viewer is drawn in and begins to want that happy ending we all hope each film has. In it's own way it does happen here but only with a great deal of love and sacrifice.
For those who are looking for a film with integrity, a good story, good acting and a few twists and turns to keep your attention, then this is it.",1193702400,41,970,4.110526315789474
2765867,2,B000NDDU1K,"Changing the title from the original ""The Inspector"" to ""Lisa"" for American release somehow misses the point, since it changes focus from Dutch police inspector Peter Jongman (Stephen Boyd) and the task he accomplishes as to appease his remorse for what he did not do for his girlfriend Rachel when seized by the Nazis: to give someone a helping hand. Drama is action, and action means change and it is Jongman who goes through a stronger process of transformation during the film narration, making him a different man in the end. Jongman finds the object of his mission  in Lisa Held (Dolores Hart in one of her last film roles), an abused Jewish girl that was a prisoner in Auschwitz, lost all her relatives and wants to go to Palestine to find a sense to all that she went through and a cure to her mental wounds. Neither character is quite original in the history of films: we have seen several stories about Jewish women traumatized by war and concentration camps like Lisa, and men like Jongman, in search of expiation. But Jongman goes to an unusual extent of his professional duty to make him an attractive character, under a light that somehow makes him different. The material taken from a novel by Dutch writer Jan de Hartog was a good basis for what could have been a better drama. Instead, in the hands of old Hollywood professional Philip Dune, the film drags the load of sentimental melodrama (not helped a bit by Malcolm Arnold's omnipresent score). By 1962 standards this was what the French critics disdainfully called ""cinma de papa"" (or ""Dad's cinema""), an old fashioned formula that in the case of literary adaptations turned the motion picture into a vehicle of the ""filmable"" aspects of the books. This is most evident when the action moves from Europe to the city of Tangier in North Africa, including cardboard scenes with smuggler Karl van der Pink (Hugh Griffith) in a flat with a big window that shows mockups of the city, and where the man is attacked by special-effects bats. I guess that what affected me the most when I  finally watched ""The Inspector"" (52 years after its release) was the fact that I had read so many good comments about it and found out they were romanticized visions of the motion picture and another reiteration of the Jewish drama (as the change of title suggests). Still the chemistry of Boyd and Hart is essential to keep us interested, backed by the usual good cast of British actors, also including Leo McKern, Donald Pleasence, Robert Stephens and Finlay Currie.",1423958400,,2521,4.740318906605922

2765898,5,B000NDDU1K,"I really enjoyed the nostalgia attached to this movie. I am particularly interested in the career of Dolores Hart. I have followed her all the way to, ""God is the Bigger Elvis.""  The brief life of actor Stephen Boyd was an interest to me as well. I remembered this movie from about 45 years ago, but couldn't think of who the female lead was. When I discovered on Internet it was Dolores Hart, I knew I had to own it.",1401840000,,417,4.2125
2765899,5,B000NDDU1K,"Dolores Hart, a great talent in the late 50s and 60s, before she entered a convent of the most strict discipline, rouses all the feelings Vanessa Redgrave did in Playing For Time. With Stephen Boyd, who was Messala in Ben-Hur, also in many Fox films before this, Dolores Hart etches a deeply moving character of a woman heading for Israel after her degradation at the hands of the Nazis. The film situates us right in the middle of the personal struggles of those murdered during the Final Solution of Hitler, Amsterdam, the last, unsafe place for Anne Frank. This film follows The Diary Of Anne Frank by a few years, and ""Kapo"" and ""Exodus"" by one or two years, so it is on target with International interest in the dramatization of pieces of the Holocaust.

This film is riveting and modern..the dark photography, the three dimensional use of CinemaScope, and the lurid colors sweep you up into a journey devastating in its telling and in its breathtaking conclusion. Dolores Hart leads everyone else, all who are splendid, into this cobweb of violence and deliverance, not unlike parts of her own personal vocation, finally making it, but not in a romantic dream or an identity that could be called conventional. Tragic and yet fulfilling, LISA sends you into a whirlpool of emotions about the Holocaust, about the lives we lead. Questions abound at the conclusion.

See Ms. Hart's other films, Francis of Assisi, Wild Is The Wind, Lonlihearts (with Montgomery Clift, Robert Ryan, and Myrna Loy), also ""Where The Boys Are,"" and her Elvis movie, the one where she gets Elvis' first kiss. Note the control in her comedies, the beach/airplane films and then watch her only western! And they had Carroll Baker do The Big Country and The Miracle. Here are riches aplenty. A great star and this is borne out in her film work. James Dean made three films..she has more than three to show you, and she is as great!!",1401321600,,1910,4.75

appropriately - the heart of the story is provided by the lovely and serene Dolores Hart - one of the most promising young actresses of her generation - she brings to the young damaged woman - gentleness - with a touch of fire

in my favorite performance of his - Stephen Boyd provides a gritty determination as the Dutch police inspector with a guilty conscience

there are many familiar faces from the British film industry - Donald Pleasence - Leo MacKern - Hugh Griffith - Harry Andrews - and a very young Robert Stephens in a lively performance as an ""unimportant"" british agent of some sort

i'm particularly fond of the homey scenes of the escaping pair during their barge trip down the canals of europe - which also prove that authentic locations were used - but even the set pieces have a pleasing foreign texture to them - however - the direction and photography are good but not great - as is the music

like the landscapes - the plot has a certain freshness - characters and scenes are often memorable - while the story doesn't built to a explosive climax - it's rational and stays on an even keel

most of all - it has dolores hart - in a role that hints at the religious sincerity that would soon steal her from hollywood - to a convent - where she remains to this day",1392595200,7,1534,4.383802816901408
