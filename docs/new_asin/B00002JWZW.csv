7915901,2,B00002JWZW,"In his first directional feature, Shane Meadows shows some good ideas that work in a couple of moments but require a few improvements overall. This realistic urban drama focuses in a british neighbourhood with poor resources and lost hopes, where its inhabitants live in an pessimistic atmosphere of gloom and doom with low expectations. In order to change a bit that situation, Bob Hoskins` character Alan Darcy creates a boxing school to help the troubled, confused young men who live random and boring lives without meaning or main goals. Although the script is well written and the acting is, for the most part, competent, this story brings nothing new and its development doesn`t offer many surprises. The black and white tone is adequate and the directing shines at parts, but it still seems like unfullfilled potential. This is an all-too-familiar territory that has been explored before, and better, in other movies, most of them also british. There are some touching and interesting moments that make it worthwhile, but as a whole it ends up being average and not as impressive as it could and should. But given that this is a debut, it still shows that Meadows is an intriguing director and one to watch in the future.",1075334400,,1228,4.908653846153846

Our BritBros.still make the BEST movies,just as in years past! All the actors and actresses are GREAT and deserving of further roles in their futures. What REALLY got me was the songs,tunes and incidental music of the score starting right out w/Van Morrison and the choral phrasings near the end are total tear-jerkers!!GREAT stuff. This is the smoothest,most tactile sound(sonic)track I have heard out of a  British film in a very long time. Everything fits right in there perfectly. The plot,the pain,the gain,the humor,the most beautiful B/W photoplay,the cast,the characters....just very,very sweet from beginning to what you don't want to see end. Too bad the cd isn't available. I'd buy 5 of them as gifts.",1037750400,,835,5.0071942446043165
7915903,5,B00002JWZW,"This film is pure gold..no more can be said.  It is incredibly moving, one of the most moving films I have ever seen.  It shows drive and hope among other things.  Its far from being a boxing movie.  It's on par with train spotting, full monty etc. although not nearly as well recognized...as I'm the first to review!
Anyway buy it...would be better on dvd but the addition i saw was on VHS..it's really beautiful and deserves much, much more attention.",986774400,,453,4.555555555555555
