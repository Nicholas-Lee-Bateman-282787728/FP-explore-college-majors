8177141,1,B000NDI4UC,"Only buy if you are not from the United States,because it is unable to read and play on any of my devices.",1427328000,,106,3.8636363636363638
8177142,1,B000NDI4UC,"Sadly, this was money spent for nothing. My daughter with autism loves this movie, but it's nearly impossible to find. I was so excited when I found it that I didn't research what the *Regions 2 & 4* meant. But, that being said, perhaps the seller failed to notice that the DVD was being shipped to Michigan, which is not in either *Region*. We didn't know it wouldn't work until we broke the seal and tried it in her portable DVD player while on vacation.

So, bottom line....if you can use/play this DVD, email me and I will send it to you....we can't use it, and have no plans to buy a player that it will work in.",1390435200,5,617,4.228813559322034
8177143,5,B000NDI4UC,"While this is a light fantasy, its ""true to thyself"" message hits hard.  ""I offered you gold, but you wanted pebbles.""  Don't we see this all around us today.....

Fine performances from all in this most enjoyable movie.",1247443200,,220,4.7368421052631575
8177144,5,B000NDI4UC,"Put together a cast headed by Tyrone Power, a simple but perfect script,  add a big dose of leprechaun, whimsy and mixed-up happenings, and you are headed for the delight of The Luck of the Irish.  I've seen it several times on TV, but not recently, when the old-time classics have a hard time finding their way to airtime.  My only hope is that this DVD will be CLOSED CAPTIONED for the hearing impaired.  CC helps one and all when you have characters speaking in Irish brogue.  This is a splendiferous movie, one of my all-time favorites.",1242950400,,540,4.525773195876289
8177145,5,B000NDI4UC,"This is one of the best ""little"" movies ever made by TCF or by any studio for that matter.  It's Tyrone Power's journey and it will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  It has so much to say about life in modern society and the choices that people make.  The music by Cyril Mockridge is perfect at setting and maintaining the mood.  Cynics will probably not like this movie, but those who have hearts that can be touched will find it an absolute joy.
The only Oscar nomination was for Cecil Kellaway as actor in a supporting role, but he lost to John Huston for Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  His delivery of the movie's punchline (""I offered ... "") is heartbreaking and inspirational at the same time.  I can't recommend this movie enough.",1202515200,7,740,4.444444444444445
