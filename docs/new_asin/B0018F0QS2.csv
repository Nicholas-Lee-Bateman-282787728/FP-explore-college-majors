3417318,5,B0018F0QS2,"Life in Cold Blood: Another Triumph for David Attenborough!

Reptiles and Amphibians have been given a bad rap in human esteem.  David Attenborough, in his continuing series of natural history documentary programs, brings us a very different view of reptiles and amphibians in this five part documentary series.
I have anticipated ""Life in Cold Blood"" with eager anticipation.

The five part series begins with ""The Cold Blooded Truth"".  David points out that the idea of ""cold bloodedness"" (poikilothermy), is a little misleading, in terms of our understanding about reptiles and amphibians and their nature, are concerned.  Slow and dimwitted has been the general concept, but the truth is much different.  The fact is that reptiles can actively control their metabolism and body temperature, and are capable of very dynamic lives, tender moments, spectacular displays, blinding speed in catching their prey, and touching parental care and affection.

What I Like About This Documentary Film.

1. Wildlife cinematography

The film footage of the variety of reptiles and amphibians in Life in Cold Blood, is extraordinary.  Crisp and succinct footage showing the viewer the behavior, colors, and diversity of these animals is breathtaking.  This has been true of all of the ""Life of"" series, especially in recent years.  Time lapse photography, thermal imaging, infrared imaging, ultraviolet imaging, night vision and computers are all used in this film.  It is a beautiful manifestation of wildlife cinematography.

2. Music.

Yes, music.  Music is used very strategically in this documentary.  Beautiful classical music emphasize, and highlight, the film footage.  The music will enhance your viewing experience, and help you to even change your idea about these creatures.

3. The science.

This is wildlife behavioral science at its best.  The science of herpetology is a bit overlooked as a discipline, but it's a cool science nonetheless.  Everything in this film is based on good, solid science beginning with observation.

4. David Attenborough.

Let's face it, this is David's film.  He hosts, narrates, and he is the star of the film.  He goes on site to these many places, holds the lizards and snakes, interacts with them, and is thoroughly charmed by them, and thoroughly charming, in his remarkable person.  He's one of my favorite human beings and has been an influence on my life, inspiring me to new interests, fascinations, and is an intellectual role model to me, and for many.

5. The ""making of"".

At the end of the first one hour documentary in this series, and indeed in all of them, there is a twelve minute segment on the making of the episode.  Here we meet some of the scientists without whose help this series wouldn't be possible.  We follow David on location, and find out that he has a fascination with reptiles that has endured since he was young.  He takes us back to the ""Zoo Quest"" series from 1960, which was a black and white documentary series that David hosted.  He went to Madagascar then, and had a particular interest in chameleons, and since Madagascar has the largest variety of chameleons in the world, he loved it.  However, he mentions that he heard about the pygmy leaf chameleon, a one inch long lizard that is among the smallest of all lizards in the world.  He never got to see it, until they made this film.  We follow David back to Madagascar, and meet the Malagasy naturalist who specializes in chameleons.  To find them, they go out at night, and find them!  David is just like a little boy, totally and utterly fascinated.  It's a treat to see him on location, so astonished to see this tiny chameleon.

All in all, ""Life in Cold Blood"", ""The Cold Blooded Truth"", is a wonderful piece of wildlife cinematography, and it is a fantastic documentary in its own right.  It's visually a treat to watch, full of variety, succinct explanations and introductions to the world of reptiles and amphibians.  It is informative, entertaining, and beautiful to watch and behold.  It is a documentary film that will move you, and it is a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch over and over again.",1221350400,44,4135,4.983918128654971
3417319,5,B0018F0QS2,"Life in Cold Blood is a work of art of the best kind: a tribute to the seldom-visited world of the reptiles and amphibians.  David Attenborough brings the viewer into the frame, making each visit close to a real experience.  Though I am an old lady, it communed with the child in me on a very personal level.  Wish I had more children to share it with.",1220918400,,352,4.223880597014926

3417321,5,B0018F0QS2,"Beautiful images of reptiles. Even better than Planet Earth, since this documentary focuses on a particular group of animals and explains their odd living and feeding habits. The chameleons are absolutely mesmerizing. I came away from watching this wanting a pet chameleon or turtle.

My only regret is that the program is too short. It combines turtles and crocodiles into a single show. Fortunately, snakes get a single episode, and there is some amazing footage of a python eating a deer whole.",1219536000,,497,5.060975609756097
3417322,5,B0018F0QS2,"In his latest, and last, installment in the 'Life' series, David Attenborough brings us another masterpiece in nature documentary. If you are a fan of his earlier works, this is just as engaging and well filmed. The series is broken into five parts, each 50 minutes long with a ""behind the scenes"" segment which lasts 10 minutes.  In all you receive 5 hours of film for under 30 dollars...a bargain.
  No fan of nature documentary, or David Attenborough, should be without this wonderful work.",1219190400,24,493,4.845238095238095
3417323,5,B0018F0QS2,"A David Attenborough film as I have grown accustomed to see them. Short sequences so beautiful that they take my breath away and nearly take my attention away from the subject. Nearly, yet they never do, just as Attenborough himself, appearing as a charming guide, never attracts attention away from but always to the filmed frog or chameleon, filmed not as an object but as an individual with whom Attenborough empathizes.
As usual with Attenborough films, this one abounds in most colorful animals, rarest animals, most fascinating behavior, recent scientific observations... As usual, Attenborough's assistants, scientists and filmmakers of great talent, are never an eye sore but discretely shown in separate parts where they seem appropriate and even necessary.
A masterpiece, comparable only to other films by the same Great Artist.",1218153600,60,838,5.404580152671755
3417324,5,B0018F0QS2,"Good DVD - informative and interestingly told photography is top shelf and clear as we have come to expect from these films by PBS.

3417326,4,B0018F0QS2,"I am an eight year old and I was watching these movies for science class.

David Attenborough takes time on describing the different animals. All the movies are educational; for example, the eastern box turtle closes its shell so it cant get eaten by predators! He also gives fascinating facts like caecilian salamander babies eat their mothers skin, but she regrows it every three days! In addition, Sir Attenborough tells the viewers the animals names. Lastly, he almost never shows animals die, and he doesnt hurt them either ;-).",1462320000,2,533,4.98876404494382

3417330,5,B0018F0QS2,"As with all of David Attenborough's ""Life"" documentaries, this one does not disappoint. Sir Attenborough effectively straddles the line between laymen and scientists, presenting information in a way that is worthy of scholarly merit, yet easily understood. This makes for an experience suitable to enlighten and entertain most any viewer, with beautiful shots of some of nature's most charismatic cold blooded creatures.",1454716800,,420,5.790322580645161

We like the fact that he includes himself, and sometimes other experts, in the frame interacting with the animals. His delight in them is obvious and it makes the subjects more relatable than some of the other documentaries where humans are invisible.

I heard about these documentaries from someone on Tumblr who said this was her favorite documentary of the year (it was published), and I can see why. I almost want to go to Australia and drive around until I find a sleepy lizard to cuddle. Mr. Attenborogh's delight in the creatures in the show is infectious, and I think even people not that interested in the life of lizards would find these shows entertaining.",1430438400,,510,4.677777777777778

3417345,5,B0018F0QS2,Another outstanding production from David Attenborough and BBC.  Attenborough's enthusiastic and knowledgeable narrative is pleasant to listen to and simply fun.  We learned so many interesting things about amphibians and reptiles.  The photography continues to be exceptional.

3417353,4,B0018F0QS2,"David Attenborough is THE standard which all nature docs are measured by. I know some of the footage has been used in other similar docs...but I guess that's to be expected.
Even so, it's wonderful footage. Reptiles are less interesting than most other animal/plant subjects (for me), but I still enjoyed this program nearly as much as every other Attenborough DVD I own.
I don't like reptiles, but David makes them more acceptable/tolerable. His understanding and perspective provides the kind of view that I'd want my children exposed to...to help guide them to appreciate rather than fear the less attractive creatures we share the planet with.
4 stars: because I think Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Blue Planet, etc, are better productions. I like the added sound effects, like sword play during lobster duels.
I think it's the overexposure to American TV that has affected my opinion. Like barking the tires on a dirt road in the Dukes of Hazzard. (Yeee Haaaw!)",1415836800,3,965,5.0

(I'm not going to vacation at Menorca this year.)

Or what about a snake that can actually jump?

3417387,5,B0018F0QS2,"I'm going to assume that most have seen something nature-related that Attenborough has either narrated or been in.  He's got his own unique personality, and was of behaving around wildlife, and it never ceases to add to his narrative charm.

The information here is wonderful, and I'm always happy so see animals that I've never heard of, despite being a wildlife biologist (primarily working with forest mammals).  Sometimes it seems a bit basic, leaving me wanting to know more.  I can only hope that this was the intention of the writers.  Good use of different angles and camera types (infrared, heat-trace) to drive home points about the ecology of this diverse group of animals.

I'm not a big fan of anthropomorphizing, and Attenborough is not shy to do this.  It doesn't really detract from the program at all.  I'm just a biologist and the instinct to care for your young and nurture their development is quite different from being ""warm"" or showing affection.  Again, not a complaint, just my soap box, and I have digressed....

I recommend this HIGHLY, as well as any other with Attenborough, for anyone interested and intrigued by the wonders of nature.  You'll get to see things from a great perspective, see crazy behaviors, and enjoy every minute of it!",1339459200,,1268,4.878504672897196
3417388,5,B0018F0QS2,The combination of David Attenborough and the BBC continues to produce outstanding videos on wild life and nature in general. This is another fine example of what this video team can do. I recommend this video and suggest that you review the other great selections in this collection of videos.,1339372800,,294,4.9
3417389,5,B0018F0QS2,"This DVD is almost (ALMOST!) enough to bring me out of retirement just so I can share it with my students!  I thought I knew quite a lot about reptiles and amphibians, but this glorious, lush series is just amazing!  Did you know that there are turtles that go into suspended animation whilst encrusted with ice?  That there is actually a marsupial frog?  Do you want to see the world's tiniest reptile and amphibian, both in Madagascar?  The only thing as good as seeing them is seeing Attenborough's unrestrained delight at seeing them for the first time!  ""Life in Cold Blood"" is a treasure---and so is Sir David Attenborough and if I could be poking through leaf litter at the age of 83, I would count myself lucky indeed!",1337904000,2,726,4.589147286821706
3417390,5,B0018F0QS2,"This DVD is in keeping with Sir David's usual high standards and engaging format. I was especially moved and I feel that this presentation actually changed my perception of these creatures. As Sir David says, most people have an unfortunately dismal if not hostile attitude towards reptiles and amphibians. Well, for myself I can say I regarded them as formidable but I realized I knew not enough about them to form a broader opinion.

Watching this DVD, I found it difficult to keep a dry eye! These creatures are magnificent: beautifully- colored lizards, serpents who twine elegantly and sensuously through the sand, female crocodiles who show immense patience and concern over their babies - and even babies not their own.

Please watch this DVD and be transformed! These much-maligned creatures do not by any means deserve the questionable reputation they have received, probably due in large part to Hollywood...

The only downside is that there is only one video on anphibians. there should be two: one for frogs and one for salamanders and newts.",1313193600,,362,4.338235294117647

3417393,5,B0018F0QS2,"No comments on the product itself. It is a great natural documentary just like many others by BBC. The only thing that was disliked by many reviewers is the presence of David Attenborough 'on-screen' a little too much. Agree. You see him for a lot of part, but its still OK. It is good to know how much of efforts are taken to make such documentaries. Its not that we don't understand, but not many of us will go to the 'special chapters' where they reveal the tactics of how this was filmed. If we are forced to see it right in the middle of the feature, then we have no escape. This point is highly debatable, but I don't want to stress on it, because, to me, the information provided by Sir Attenborough is really worth-he even tells us some history about how technological advances have helped in making such documentaries in the recent hi-res formats (information-a critical part of a documentary, isn't?). So, its no harm in watching him on-screen in one of the documentaries especially when we have enjoyed several of them narrated by him in the past (as he took us on the most mesmerizing/breathtaking/enchanting rides across the globe without showing up himself). Hence, I believe, we can overlook this point when purchasing this DVD. Because, for the quality, this is a 'must-have' in your collection besides Planet earth and Blue Planet. This collection is a brilliant specific compilation of reptiles and amphibians specifically and hence, it reveals them in full details (Not 'touch base' kinda thing that happens in broad-scoped series like Planet Earth).
Unrelated but Important point- Recently i visited one zoo and thereby re-realized strongly how lucky I was to see so many animals in their natural habitat from my couch (in BBC wildlife series). Most animals in zoo will either be sitting in a corner or all curled up not revealing their faces. Many times it is so difficult to spot them even in a confined environment. In this regard, it is really a treat to have such documentaris home, which take us from one pole to another within minutes (all in 20-50 bucks). Taking this point, I guess it should not be too hard for us to watch those people (who are behind these great films) on TV for a while.",1289779200,,2219,4.6923076923076925

David Attenborough makes more appearances in this film which I enjoy, and he does an incredible job of personifying a group of animals that most people find dull, boring, and unemotional.  After watching this, you will think just the opposite!  He will cover species of reptiles with fascinating behaviors like that of many mammals (even humans!), and change your perspective completely.

3417398,5,B0018F0QS2,"I can forgive this the title (reptiles don't have ""cold blood""; they thermoregulate to keep their core temps high enough to function).  I can forgive that simply because this is, on the whole the best documentary we have on reptiles and amphibians. It is, in fact, what turned me on to the BBC nature documentaries.

This series goes beyond the easy, commonplace work of other films that focus on, say, Komodos or crocodiles. During the course of this series, species most people have never even heard of are explored in a wonderful, awe inspiring way.

In total, there are 5 episodes; one for a sort of overview (the cold blooded truth), one for amphibians, one for lizards, one for snakes and one that combined both turtles and crocs.  All are wonderfully shot; one thing the BBC has going for it is an excellent film crew.  Shots are well composed, narration is crisp and relevant.  These are not just good documentaries; they're artistically made movies. That they manage to treat the subject they cover so well is amazing. Combining good documentary techniques with excellent filmaking is rare and wonderful.

Each episode covers a wide range of it's subject matter; the amphibian episode actually covers caecilians for instance, and the lizard episode covers far more than than the over-exposed Komodo--pygmy chameleons, shingleback skinks, dwarf blue tongue skinks all get coverage.  In the snakes episode, they discuss rattlers and giant pythons...but they also discuss the Queen snake (a crayfish specialist). In the episode about chelonians and crocs they deal with the Galapagos tortoises...but also the fly-river (or pig-nosed) turtle. They cover the migration of the spectacled caiman...and show a female caiman helping the young to complete the journey.  The range of species is amazing, and it's gratifying to find a documentary that does not focus on the same handful of reptiles as every other documentary does. That it not only mentions but also actually explores these forgotten species is even better.

If you like herps, or if you just like nature documentaries...get this. It's one of the few worthwhile reptile documentaries, and the only really good one I've seen.",1273017600,3,2188,5.120786516853933

The film also has behind the scenes segments after the traditional documentary footage, which gives a perspective of what scientists and conservationists are doing to study, help protect and save critical habitat for these wonderful organisms. As a student studying ecology this film made me more excited to continue what I am doing and gives me hope that others may become as excited with all manners of life as Sir David Attenborough and I.",1264809600,,595,5.081632653061225

This may be just what is needed to elevate the ""charisma factor"" of these humble but intriguing creatures in the popular imagination so they can finally get the respect and protection that they deserve.
