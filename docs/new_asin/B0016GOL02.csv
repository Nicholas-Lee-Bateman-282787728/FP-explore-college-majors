8262597,5,B0016GOL02,"This is definitely one the more unique Madhubala films I've seen so far (Ive seen six or seven).  It may not have done well in the box office in its time due to its overt socialist and nationalistic themes (Nehruvian idealism), or its resulting mishmash of every other traditional element in Indian cinema, but that it was attempting something ambitious and different is exactly what I liked about it.  I love more experimental, less-popular films like this where one can see all sorts of potentialities because it leaves more to the imagination.

Madhubala plays a somewhat deglamorized poor blue-collar worker, along with the spritely and adorable Minoo Mumtaz, both of whom are really talented and enjoyable actors on all levels.  So far, most of the films Ive seen from this era of Indian films take on comedic family issues and love themes that are more popular with mainstream audiences.  Like another Madhubala film I really like, Sharabi, which boldly portrays the destructiveness of alcoholism, Insaan Jaag Utha, under the direction of Shakti Samanta (Howrah Bridge -1958, etc.) uses the building of a dam (incipient stages of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam in Nalgonda, Telangana India) as the films main backdrop, and main character really.

The story revolves around Ranjit, a dockworker in Bombay who, having gotten mixed up in a friends failed ploy to steal a briefcase full of gold from some smugglers is on the run. After hiding it in a grove of trees he is captured by the police and sentenced to five years in jail. By the time he gets out the location of the gold has been turned into a house for some laborers at the dam construction site.  Gauri, played by Madhubala lives there with her ex-freedom fighter father, Laxmandas, and her younger brother.  Romantic tension builds between the caddish Ranjit and firebrand Gauri who works at the dam with her comrade Muniyan, played by the spritely Minoo Mumtaz (also in Howrah Bridge). Some goons from Bombay have followed Ranjit, who gets a job at the site, and are waiting to discover the location of the hidden gold.  There are some interesting scenes of historical and cultural interest at the industrial site, along with some spirited interactions between Gauri and Muniyan and their romantic pursuers. I really enjoyed the delightful song routine of Janu Janu Re (Asha Bhosle and Geeta Dutt). Never-minding the crazy plot and idealistic ending, theres plenty to like here and its a must-have movie for Madhubala fans.
