6401506,3,B00K2OBXXC,"A bit farfetched but still an entertaining suspense story of an unstable woman who offers to be a surrogate for a couple, but with the intention of stealing the husband away for herself.",1405468800,,186,4.666666666666667
6401507,3,B00K2OBXXC,"The film opens with Catherine (Amy Scott) running out of a house having some sort of issue. Four years later she emerges as Kate, a college whatever in love with author/professor Jacob Kelly (Cameron Mathison)  and exhibits stalker tendencies. We discover Jacob has a wife Allison (Annie Wersching) whose collection of frozen eggs has dwindled down to one.  Kate forces her way into the job of surrogate by eliminating the competition.

Yes, this is another film where young girl wants to replace the wife so she can be with her husband. We have seen so many of these things, we groan over the idea they would make another one, especially with the made for TV quality this one has. However, since Kate is carrying the child, they really don't want to hurt her. As the plot turns to Misery we discover Kate is also a victim herself. In fact I had to laugh because her personal story was so much more interesting than the one they produced.

Not the worse thing at Redbox. Might work as one of their free rentals.  2 1/2 stars
