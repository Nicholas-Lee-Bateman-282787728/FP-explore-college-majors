8016327,3,B0001US7KY,"This DVD features 18 videos by different artists but I purchased it because I wanted the 3 videos by the Spice Girls together and as solo artists. My review is about their vidoes:

Geri Halliwell - Mi Chico Latino: I liked the Spanish feel of this song. Mostly in the guitars. It made me want to go to Spain. And I like the video. It looks like it was filmed in the Mediterranean Sea. It's just beautiful. Wish I was there. And Geri's body looks great.

Spice Girls - Spice Up Your Life: This video is somewhat dark and industrial but I do like the song. It is very upbeat with a Latin feel to it.

Melanie G. - Word Up: This song is a remake of Word Up that was originally done by the Group Cameo. Melanie G. was formally known as Scary Spice of the Spice Girls and now known by Melanie B. or Melanie Brown her maiden name. She did an interesting job with this song to say the least but the video to me is horrible. It's all animated and she's not even in it except for a quick animated glimpse of her face. Who's idea was that? She should have been in her own video for real.

Other videos featured on this DVD are:

Culture Club - Karma Chameleon

Katrina & The Waves - Walking On Sunshine",1137283200,,1192,4.116379310344827
