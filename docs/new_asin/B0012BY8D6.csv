8494760,3,B0012BY8D6,I got this documentary hoping the graphics would be good and they are alright. The graphics and the content are kind of dated. The premise of the show with its future timeline is unique. But some of the things pictured will not happen for decades. I liked this dvd but given that it is dated and the graphics are now dated as well I gave it only three stars. I think it is a little expensive for what you get but when this was first published it was definitely cutting edge.,1371859200,,474,4.21978021978022
