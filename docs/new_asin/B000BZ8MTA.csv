8094735,5,B000BZ8MTA,"this is a great  video for anyone who is about to do crown molding.  It is well made, easy to follow and shows all the things that need
to be done make the job look like an expert. By the time one is done practicing cuts, it will become an easy task. One thing to be extremely sure about is the truenes of the wall.  If the wall it not exactly straight, cut will not be accurate.  On should learn to cope the corners. That makes it so much easier. Only one end of the molding has to be mitered and carved out, and it makes a perfect fit once the technique is learned.  Great Video",1398470400,2,580,3.9655172413793105

8094738,5,B000BZ8MTA,"This DVD set has a lot of great practical material and useful tips for installing crown molding. Be sure to read the PDF files included on the DVD. Most useful for me was learning that the degree markings on my chop saw were all incorrect! Katz recommends tools and shows you exactly how he uses them. I tried doing crown on the cheap but ended up purchasing some of the tools that Katz recommends on this CD (Bosch angle finder, decent chop saw). For me that was the way to get the truly great results that Katz shows you how to accomplish. There are many tips here on general workmanship that you can bring to many other endeavours. I used the information on this CD to restore a 1920's fourplex in grand style. Highly recommended.",1151798400,11,733,4.437037037037037
