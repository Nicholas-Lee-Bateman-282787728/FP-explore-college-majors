8347806,5,B001XW7IGI,"Awesome step workout with options for lower impact and lower intensity. This workout takes a little while to learn the choreography but it is not too complex and is a blast once you get it down. Great intense cardio workout! Sharon is a very good instructor and very motivating. I have her other 2 workouts, All Body Attack and Zero to Sixty, and those are great too.",1384387200,,367,4.492537313432836
