3122617,5,B00144K5LK,"My wife gave me this for Christmas and I was like a little kid, this is one of my favorite series ever to be on TV. So far I've only watched a few episodes from the 1st season which I actually missed when NYPD Blue came on, so I'm very happy to catch up on the series and how it all began.
I have no complaints with the picture quality, looks and sounds great to me, I'm playing them on a LCD screen, you can change you TV so it is the OLD 4:3 Screen, but it's better if it's left at the 16:9 screen default. The sound quality is Dolby Digital and it pretty damn good for an old show!

3122689,5,B00144K5LK,Great television does not come along all the time.  This ground breaking series is still worth watching more than twenty years after it premiered.  David Caruso was perfect for the part of John Kelly and should have never left.  Jimmy Smits took over without missing a beat.

3122741,5,B00144K5LK,This is classic police TV at its best. It was great viewing 20 years ago and it continues to show how imaginative the camera work and gutsy casting were to produce this very watchable series. The actors relaxed into their characters by the 3rd episode. Rolling story lines keep up the interest. Did 'the Wire' use this as its base and enhance the great areas of serial TV? Maybe. Steve Bochco moved form Hill Street Blues to NYPD smoothly hitting my entertainment button right on!,1372896000,5,480,4.658823529411765

3122743,5,B00144K5LK,"I gave up on televison more than a decade ago and one of the few things I missed most were the re-runs of NYPD Blue.  When I found this 'first four seasons' set I thrilled at the chance and devoured the DVDs once I had them, going back for a second viewing with commentaries, loving it.  But now for the bad news...once the appetite is whetted one wants the rest of the show...seasons 5 through 12...but they're nowhere to be found.  That is, nowhere 'legit'.  You can take a flyer on pirated versions (like I did) and if you do you'll be sorry.  I bought one set from an outfit that suggested it was in London, England; but the dvds came from Beijing, China and they're crap even when they do play (and not all of them do).

3122761,4,B00144K5LK,"I just finished watching the Pilot Episode of Season One after receiving this ""box set"" a couple of days ago, and I had to laugh at the famous confrontation between Sipowicz and ADA Sylvia Costas outside the courtroom where the judge let mobster Giardello walk. Little did any of us know when we saw it first-run on TV that it was a prelude to a courtship, no less! So much that Costas became the only person to be able to correct Andy's speech. For example, after they are married, one episode depicts Andy referring to people from India as ""dotheads"", only to have Costas chide him gently; ""Now Andy, I've told you before about that kind of talk."". Sipowicz's response isn't the kind of bluster Costas got from him when they first met--instead it's a shamefaced ""sorry"".

One thing I'm hoping isn't a feature throughout these first 4 seasons is the infuriating main menu each disc of Season 1 has, which I'm hoping isn't on the other 3 seasons in this set. And I'm praying that Shout Factory didn't adopt that for Seasons 5 & 6 which they picked up this past year. It seems to take forever to move between episodes on that menu, which makes for a lot of ""come on already"" when you're specifically going for the last episode on the menu. It's like the menu only looks like it's all the same page, but instead has separate ones for each episode on a given disc, with invisible ""dog fencing"" between them.

This set is only the first 4 seasons, and I'm not seeing the other 8 seasons in any form--individually or in other box sets. I see Season 5 available in streaming, but that's it. The later seasons are where Sipowicz ""grows up""--he's still satisfyingly rude, but not a complete nihilist anymore. Which is proven when his last boss (in these first 4 seasons, he can't get along with brass at all) recommends him as his successor for command of the squad. There's an outfit in Canada that has the complete series, but caveat emptor! I bought ""Paper Chase"" from them because I couldn't find anything beyond the first two ABC seasons here, and that 12-disc set has some defective discs. Plus they have a nasty habit of cramming 5 or 6 episodes on a disc, which doesn't work unless you use dual-layer discs, which they don't. I don't understand why they're still sitting on the last 8 seasons of an ""official version"" of this series.",1337212800,24,2333,4.552380952380952

But now for the bad news...once the appetite is whetted one wants the rest of the show...seasons 5 through 12...but they're nowhere to be found.  That is, nowhere 'legit'.  You can take a flyer on pirated versions (like I did) and if you do you'll be sorry.  I bought one set from an outfit that suggested it was in London, England; but the dvds came from Beijing, China and they're crap even when they do play (and not all of them do).

3357258,4,B00144K5LK,"I just finished watching the Pilot Episode of Season One after receiving this ""box set"" a couple of days ago, and I had to laugh at the famous confrontation between Sipowicz and ADA Sylvia Costas outside the courtroom where the judge let mobster Giardello walk. Little did any of us know when we saw it first-run on TV that it was a prelude to a courtship, no less! So much that Costas became the only person to be able to correct Andy's speech. For example, after they are married, one episode depicts Andy referring to people from India as ""dotheads"", only to have Costas chide him gently; ""Now Andy, I've told you before about that kind of talk."". Sipowicz's response isn't the kind of bluster Costas got from him when they first met--instead it's a shamefaced ""sorry"".

One thing I'm hoping isn't a feature throughout these first 4 seasons is the infuriating main menu each disc of Season 1 has, which I'm hoping isn't on the other 3 seasons in this set. And I'm praying that Shout Factory didn't adopt that for Seasons 5 & 6 which they picked up this past year. It seems to take forever to move between episodes on that menu, which makes for a lot of ""come on already"" when you're specifically going for the last episode on the menu. It's like the menu only looks like it's all the same page, but instead has separate ones for each episode on a given disc, with invisible ""dog fencing"" between them.

This set is only the first 4 seasons, and I'm not seeing the other 8 seasons in any form--individually or in other box sets. I see Season 5 available in streaming, but that's it. The later seasons are where Sipowicz ""grows up""--he's still satisfyingly rude, but not a complete nihilist anymore. Which is proven when his last boss (in these first 4 seasons, he can't get along with brass at all) recommends him as his successor for command of the squad. There's an outfit in Canada that has the complete series, but caveat emptor! I bought ""Paper Chase"" from them because I couldn't find anything beyond the first two ABC seasons here, and that 12-disc set has some defective discs. Plus they have a nasty habit of cramming 5 or 6 episodes on a disc, which doesn't work unless you use dual-layer discs, which they don't. I don't understand why they're still sitting on the last 8 seasons of an ""official version"" of this series.",1337212800,24,2333,4.552380952380952

Suffice to say, if I were rating the show only, then this would be a five star review.

But then there are the DVD issues, which just should not be!  The DVDs containing the earlier two seasons have a menu that I would just classify as funky.  I suppose someone wanted to be artsy, but I find it to be just a pain.  The show is supposed to be art (and it sure is), but the menu to get into the show should be functional (and it sure is not).  You have to wait a whole long time for the choice to pop up onto the screen, and the active menu item is not clear.  Finally, you have to click way more often than you should have to.  One of the DVDs in season 4 had issues with regard to skipping. I checked and could find no scratches.  I suspect a problem when they manufactured the disk.  I took the DVD to other players and the same thing happened.

So I knocked off a star because of the DVDs.  If I were scoring the DVDs by themselves, it would really rate only two stars!",1489968000,,1163,3.9655172413793105
