4705876,4,B005HVWVCC,"after watching zebra man, i was hooked. this film disappointed like so many other sequels. it seems like they spent a lot more money on this film, but the whole storyline and character development was lacking. i feel like they just said hey, lets make this shit as weird as possible, screw the story. zebra queen was pretty ridiculous. it wasn't bad enough to keep me from wanting to pre order a part 3 if they ever make one.",1378512000,4,425,4.3924050632911396
4705877,2,B005HVWVCC,"The original Zebraman was a strange film, which is basically what you'd expect from Director Takashi Miike. The original played out like a bizarre Japanese version of Kick-ass that played around with Sentai conventions instead of superhero ones. It was a big, silly, nonsensical film that succeeded because most of the film was spent establishing relatable  characters that could serve as an emotional core to an otherwise really silly film. It all felt a bit disjointed by the climax but the denouement delivered on the set-up, with the introverted School teacher Shinichi Ichikawa becoming a hero in the worlds eyes as Zebraman, it was a pretty perfect pay off to the film.
In Zebraman 2 we pick up right where the first film left off and it's about the only glimpse we get of what made the original so endearing in the entire film. Zebraman has become an international sensation and his house is swarmed by a mob of fans and reporters, Ichikawa seems tired, his wife and children have left him and he can't even take out the garbage without being pestered by the mob. This scene could've been a great set-up for a better film, maybe involving Ichikawa shunning the people and over time realizing he has to come back to save the day. Instead the film goes off-rails into a convoluted storyline about a dystopic future run by a pop-star and an army of armed soldiers, the premise is actually kinda fitting in terms of some of the weird things Sentai fiction usually gets up to, but that's all it is, a silly convoluted mess with no real emotional core. We get a neat character in a former actor who played Zebraman in the revived tv series after Zebraman became a media sensation but he mostly just plays as a comic relief character who flails about and says stupid things. Eventually events escalate to the climax which is foreshadowed to death beforehand, but not before one of the most hilariously out of place scenes I've ever seen in a movie that involves a safe sex PSA flashing across the screen. Anyways, the climactic battle looks pretty neat but that's about all it has going for it. The film ends on a ridiculous and stupid note after about 2 hours of nonsensical convoluted scene after convoluted scene. There's no emotional payoff at the end, there's no characters for us to relate to, everything is shallow and underwhelming. I do hope that a third film is made so Miike can redeem the franchise, but I'm not holding my breathe",1361232000,,2442,4.67906976744186
4705878,2,B005HVWVCC,i liked the first zebraman when it came out. it was good. so i bought zebraman 2. but zebraman 2 was not what i expected. the story line got me uninterested and the acting was so so.,1329609600,,182,3.945945945945946
4705879,3,B005HVWVCC,"This isn't a terrible movie, but it simply isn't as good as Zebraman.  This movie had a very large budget and it shows.  The problem is that they spent a lot of money and a good portion of the movie making techno music videos of a Christina Aguillera meets Zebraman pop star.  Although interesting at first, it gets old very quickly.

This movie is a classic examply of Japanese cinema embracing style over substance and quality story telling.  I would recommend renting this, but I definately regret purchasing this.  I would definately get Zebraman over this any day.

The original was a tale of a obsessive shut-in teacher with dreams of being a super-hero.  Everything that made that movie great is not in this film.  It's worth a watch, but don't set your expectations very high.",1325721600,2,784,4.705882352941177
4705880,3,B005HVWVCC,"In 2004, Takashi Miike (""13 Assassins"", ""Ichi the Killer"", ""Audition"") would surprise his viewers by taking on a superhero action/comedy film.

Taking place in 2010, the film would feature a story about a 3rd grade teacher and family man named Shinichi Ichikawa who's life is not going all that great. His wife cheats on him, his teenage daughter dates older men and his son is constantly bullied because his father is a teacher. His students disrespect him.  Life, is not a happy one for Shinichi.

In order to get away from life, he dresses up at night as ""Zebraman"", a character from an unpopular 1970's tokusatsu TV series that he watched as a child. While crimes and murders occur near the school that he teaches, Shinichi decides to confront these criminals as Zebraman but quickly learns that these criminals are actually possessed by aliens and somehow, he absorbs a special power to take on the aliens.

As the film was enjoyed by many, Miike decided to create a second film but this time taking place in 2025, 15 years after the events of ""Zebraman"".

This time around, Tokyo has been taken control of governor Kozo Aihara (played by Guadalcanal Taka) who has significantly cut crime in Japan and because of what he accomplished, to further cut down the crime, he has merged Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and surrounding areas and renamed the region as Zebra City.

At 5:00 AM/PM, the government has allowed for ""Zebra Time"", in which Zebra police and his Zebra Mini-Skirt Police can attack and kill any presumed criminal.  And during ""Zebra Time"", his daughter Yui/the Zebra Queen played by Riisa Naka) performs for her audience and is a major pop star, while behind-the-scenes, she is a sadistic and psychotic woman!

Meanwhile, we are given a glimpse to what has happened to Zebraman/Shinichi Ichikawa.  15-years ago, he was captured by Kozo Aihara and for some reason, he and a young girl, Sumire (played by Mei Nagano) were experimented on for some reason and now his hair is white.

One day, he is seen running fro the Zebra police during Zebra Time and is shot dozens of times.  He is rescued by Junpei Ichiba (played by Naoki Tanaka) and taken to the White Horse camp that is off-limits to Zebra City and is run by Kohei Asano (played by Masahiro Inoue), a nurse and the leader of the camp.  Asano is shocked to see his former teacher Ichikawa at the camp but it appears he has lost all his memory within the last 15-years.

While rehabilitating, he is introduced by Junpei to the ""Zebraman"" TV series which Junpei played the hero in costume.  And immediately, Junpei starts to gain some memories and starts to go crazy.  While Asano sedates him, Junpei wants to know the truth of how Shinichi is able to not have any injuries when he was attacked by the Zebra police and Asano tells him the truth... Shinichi Ichikawa is the original Zebraman.

Meanwhile, Yui and her trusted samurai guardian named Niimi (played by Tsuyoshi Abe) are trying to find a girl who has an alien inside her.  If Yui can capture this alien, she can be the most powerful woman in the planet and release ""Zebra Time"" on the world.  But her father does not want them going after the alien because of the incidents that took place 15-years ago.  If anything, he doesn't want her to pursue them and focus on bringing ""Zebra Time"" to the United States.

Back in the camp, Shinichi meets a girl named Sumire, who doesn't talk.  But for some reason, she begins communicating with Shinichi and when she touches him, she awakens part of his memories and also revives his Zebraman powers.  Shinichi is not sure why Sumire can do such a thing but it also awakens Yui's power and for some reason, she can feel what Shinichi is feeling.  Why is that?

VIDEO:

""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" is presented in 1080i High Definition (2:40:1).  The film definitely looks fantastic for the majority of the film.  The film was shot with a lot of green screen and given a J-Pop heavy black, tad bit higher exposure to have this sort of look that is quite common in J-Pop music videos and also adds an interesting style to the film.  During Yui's scenes, we are greeted with darker blacks and vibrant colors, while Shinichi's scenes are daytime earthtones.  During the latter part of the film, at night, I did notice slight banding during the fire scenes but for the most part, the film looks very good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" is presented in Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is presented with English subtitles.  The lossless audio for the film is what stands out the most.  Dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music which has a good amount of bass.  But the surround channels are used for ambiance, sirens and the more action-intensive sequences.  While the soundtrack is not fully immersive, you do get a good amount of surround during the action scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I suppose the best way to describe Takashi Miike's ""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" is ambitious and a Japanese popcorn action-film that tries to blend a superhero film with comedy.

And at times, I felt as if I was watching an extended version of a music video, so far from the concept of the original film which was more underdog who has been bullied and disrespected, saving the world from aliens.  In this case, screenwriter Kankuro Kudo (""Ping Pong"", ""Zebraman"", ""Go"", ""Maiko Haaaan!!!"") was incorporating that crazy style that he was known for in ""Maiko Haaaan!!!"" of make-believe and a serious dramatic story with this sequel, and for the most part, many Japanese film critics and audiences didn't go for it.

Everyone loves the underdog rising to the occasion type of film but ""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" was trying to go for a storyline that seemed appropriate for an anime or even a video game, but perhaps that was the goal... to bring something that seemed plausible for those mediums and taking all the unbelievable craziness and bring it to the big screen.

And because the story seems to have unusual pacing, some western viewers may feel turned off by the overall film.

But if you are familiar with Takashi Miike films or even Kankuro Kudo screenplays and are familiar with Japanese action/comedy cinema, you know what you're going to get, it's just about how satisfied you feel after watching it.

As a Japanese popcorn action film, I felt that it had a good amount of laughs and action and for most guys, seeing actress Riisa Naka (who usually plays ""pure""  dramatic roles) all bound with leather, push-up bra and showcasing a lot of skin and sexy dance choreography, I wouldn't be surprised if people enjoyed the film much more because of her character role.

As for the Blu-ray release, it's a pretty good Blu-ray release from FUNimation Entertainment as you get plenty of special features and also a DVD included.  Picture quality was good for 1080i but had some banding issues, but it's a pretty slick and stylish presentation that I enjoyed.  And the lossless soundtrack was also enjoyable to listen as well.  If anything, I wish the direct-to-video movie (""Zebra Miniskirt Police no Gyakushu) featuring the Mini-Skirt Police was included (this was released several months before the film in Japan and takes place one year before the events of the second film).

But compared to the original ""Zebraman"", the storyline of ""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" is much weaker and also ambitious in trying to balance the action and comedy of this sci-fi superhero film.  There are quite a few plot holes and do we ever find out what happens to the Zebra Mini-Skirt Police?  They were just forgotten...

Needless to say, despite the weakness of the story, I do credit the costume designer especially for the outfit of the Zebra Queen and the final combined Zebraman outfit but most importantly, the visual effects team who did a good job.

For those who are wondering if they can watch this second film without seeing the first, the answer is ""yes"".  You get a pretty good backstory to Shinichi and Zebraman but it would be nice if FUNimaton Entertainment does release the original ""Zebraman"" on Blu-ray.

But ""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" is a crazy, fun, action film with a weak plot but where else can you find a film where you hear crazy sound effects, such as those that accompany Shinichi's blinking or a huge alien (that reminded me of the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man of ""Ghostbusters"") who is able to hurt people with it's gigantic fart.

But the way it ended, I felt it was too ridiculous to end the film in such a way and it actually dampered my overall feeling for the film.

Overall, ""Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City"" may not be for everyone but if you love the crazy antics of action anime and manga series, love superhero films, you may find this sequel to be to your liking.",1323993600,,10006,4.744212962962963
4705881,4,B005HVWVCC,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --It's unnecessary to have seen the original Zebraman to understand the sequel. There's a brief recap of the past events at the beginning of the film, and neither movie makes much sense anyway, so it's just as well to not put too much thought into it and enjoy the ride. As ridiculous as the original was, Miike has upped the ante in every respect with Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City, delivering a sequel that is completely insane and even more enjoyable than its predecessor.

Miike and writer Kankuro Kudo, who also penned the original, had a significantly larger budget this go around and used it everywhere he could. The fights are bigger, the effects are more explosive, and everything is flashier. But even though the sequel was clearly far more expensive than the original, Attack on Zebra City still retains the cheap esthetic of the ""Giant Robot"" movies and television shows that have been forever popular in Japan. With an eye pointed firmly on Ultraman and its imitators, Miike simultaneously mimics and mocks the genre, with all the bad wire work, foam rubber costumes, and flashing lights that come along with it. Miike and Kudo went even farther than that, though. As they should, the non-super people in the film revere Zebraman with unwavering respect and gratitude. In tribute to his heroism, a television show is made about his exploits and this Zebraman rendition is even more ridiculous than the reality. Plus, the actor who played the hero on the show gets into the act, believing that he was somehow granted some of Zebraman's powers to very good effect. There's a little bit of winking at the audience, which usually bugs me, but they've so accurately made fun of themselves at the same time and it's so good-natured that I have a hard time really getting upset about that.

A lot of what makes it, though, is that Miike once again shows how solid a director he is, regardless of genre. Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City is the sort of thing that, done lazily, would still engender a following based around people who love cheesy pop culture from Japan. This is no lazy production, though. Miike combines the elements we expect from the genre with his own vision to make a high style, very flashy film that is enjoyable from start to finish. Even if you hate the music of the Zebra Queen, and that's pretty easy to do, there's no doubt about the skill behind the camera for the video. It looks like Lady Gaga entered an old Nine Inch Nails video, at Trent Reznor for lunch, and stole his outfit. It's J-Pop perfection in all its nauseating catchiness and insane lyrics. The movie is almost worth watching strictly on these moments

Doing her own singing, Riisa Naka is absolutely fantastic as the Zebra Queen. This is one of only a few pieces that she has been in, but she takes the role by the throat and is a wonderfully evil counterpart to Zebraman. Aikawa returns as the superhero and, as he was in the first film, he is very solid as the wide-eyed doofus who is forced to fight. He's completely sympathetic, silly, and perfect for the role. The A Clockwork Orange-clad governor is great in his small, but pivotal role, and young Mei Nagano is surprising good as the little girl with the alien power inside her. The performances aren't nuanced or perfectly executed, but they're perfectly suited to the matter at hand: striping evil and kicking aliens in the teeth.

I didn't realize that Funimation produced live-action DVDs, but here they are with a very solid two-disc set for Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra City. The feature takes up the entirety of the first disc, and it's a fine piece of work. For a standard definition disc, the transfer is excellent, with very good detail and virtually perfect colors. The clarity accentuates the somewhat cheap-looking quality of the film, though that cheapness is part of the fun, so it's hard to complain about that. The Blu-ray should be even stronger, but this SD transfer will more than suffice. The sound, too, is quite good. The nicely mixed surround track is full and bright in all channels with good separation and solid use of the rear speakers, especially during the music videos; for as bad as the songs are, they really do sound great.

The extras populate the second disc and, while they aren't the broadest set of extras imaginable, they are pretty good. The main extra is a feature length making-of piece that eschews the usual self-congratulatory fluff for a detailed, day-by-day account of the movie in production. At ninety minutes, it runs long and feels long, but it's a perfect amount of time to hammer home just how tedious filmmaking can be, even (or especially) for something with such schlocky results. A second making-of shows some of the behind the scenes action for the music video production. It's not nearly as detailed as the first one, but it's a good little piece. Five interviews with cast and crew members and some trailers round out the disc.

4705882,5,B005HVWVCC,"I've seen this movie a lot. i got a copy when i lived out in Korea and its been one of my best friends.

If you've seen the first Zebraman then you pretty much know what your getting into. It's just more over the top, with a much higher budget. that said if you haven't seen the first Zebraman, you don't need to, it give a very simple recap at the beginning, but it would hurt. and why not it's another great addition to the director Takashi Miike's body of works.

The main points to know is that Zebraman has lost his powers or has been split into black and white, white being good and man version, black being a sexy japanese girl that does a great Lady Gaga impression with music video. And this time the stories a lot more fast pass, i found the first movie to get a little lost in the middle with Zebraman trying to figure put how to fly. This movie, after the first 20 minutes of him finding his powers again he's back in action and kicking ass.

My recommendation is if you like over the top Japanese movies, Japanese girls in latex or mini skirts, or cosplay. you'll find this movie to be a great laugh, and you never know you might find it touching, though i wouldn't bet on it. i do, but I'll leave it at that. When i first saw this movie it was at the Busan film Festival full of westerners and basically all i heard was WTF and laughs. A pretty good sign i think.

8473707,2,B005HVWVCC,"Zebraman is one of my favorite films and I've watched it a ton of times. I had high hopes for Zebraman 2 and purchased it sight unseen as soon as I found out it existed. There were a few chuckles but in general it doesn't have the same magic as the original and I feel no need to rewatch, nor to have my friends watch it.

8473710,4,B005HVWVCC,"If you loved the zaniness of the first Zebraman directed by Takashi Miike then you will enjoy this one. This movie picks up where the last one left off and continues the story forward in unexpected ways---which is what one would expect from Miike. The movie is well shot. The script is beautiful, simple, and crazy all at the same time.

As good as it is, and as much as it is what you are expecting after the first film, it does feel like this movie is missing something. The first Zebraman is a crazy revisioning of the Super Sentai and Cosplay fandom mixed with a superhero film. This one is that too. However, the first one had more pathos and ethos swirling around the main character and many of those emotional and logical strings seemed to have been cut in this sequel. So while the first Zebraman can be compared to Birdman or (Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) this sequel cannot. Since so many characters are missing from the first film, this sequel seems to have lost some of its magic. Still, it is a great film and well made.",1491523200,,1036,4.4526315789473685

this sequle lives up to its predecessor due to the fact that anything still goes.
the whole black and white theme of this movie remind you that nither can exist on its own.
we still follow the plot of a tv show and get the same deviation from the original ending.

the acting came back with a vengeance.
the plot is even easier to follow.
a touch morethan CGI this time around.
the action is speed up, but it works beautifully.
music is more modern feel with more to do with the movie than anything.

zebra man has lost his stripes in the form of our female lead whom stole the movie.
not cuz were staring at her chest. but because she can act and sing as a lady gaga esk evil doer. she is the movie in alot of the terms.

this movie is worth the money and the time to watch it.
