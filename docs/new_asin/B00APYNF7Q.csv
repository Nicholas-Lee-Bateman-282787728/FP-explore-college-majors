5467472,5,B00APYNF7Q,"For those who don't know Full Moon Productions, or Charles Band allow me to enlighten you. Charles Band is the creator of such horror movies as Kill Joy, Puppet Master, Ginger Dead Man, Troll, okay, that enough... the man's made over 200 movies in the B-Movie Horror genre. I've known of his work since the eighties. The Evil Bong series is no exception of his cheesy dialog, and estranged sense of humor. On another note, though for the stoners still reading, this set of movies is funny, and according to my ""smoker friends"" it's even more hilarious... while on... well... you know.... but I wouldn't. Anyways, anyone whose a fan of either Charles Band, or just stoner movies in general, you'll like this set, and for the price, it definitely stays in the average stoners budget. Reeses Peaces...",1393286400,7,798,4.7898550724637685
