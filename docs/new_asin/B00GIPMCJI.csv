8623590,3,B00GIPMCJI,"A logical coupling of great music, great video, flawless surround sound, what could be better?  Try better performances. Thielemann is too busy
fussing around with tempi and phrasing and will not let the music flow ,just as many have mentioned about his Beethoven symphony box. Unfortunately Brahms suffers even more than Beethoven. Listen to the fourth movement of the first symphony where the big theme comes in---instead of coming in
with just a hint of a pause, Thielemann waits---count it---a full 5 seconds, enough tiime to say to yourself, get ready guys, here comes the really, really
BIG theme!  Compare this with Dausgaard's performance (4 symphonies with the Daniish National Symphony) to see how it should be done. Wait.
This is a logical pairing, and  a really good one will come along. Those who waited for the Jansons Beethoven symphonies were likewise richly
rewarded.  If you must have your Brahms now, this is sorta O.K.",1449964800,4,938,5.032258064516129
8623591,2,B00GIPMCJI,"For the most part these are excellent performances.  However the deal breaker for me is Thielemann's choice of occasionally, and for me unexpectedly, slowing tempos or emphasizing different parts of movements that strike me as personal embellishments.  I found them so frustrating the I sold the set.",1448582400,5,300,5.361702127659575

8623594,5,B00GIPMCJI,"But that's only because there is so little symphonic music available on Blu-ray. (I have a Barenboim Brahms First, and Thielemann tops that.) The best I have is still the Solti-Chicago Brahms cycle on London, but that's been around awhile. Thielemann isn't Mr. Excitement, but I think you'll still find this series, recorded in both Tokyo and Dresden, engaging.",1403395200,6,361,5.135593220338983
8623595,5,B00GIPMCJI,"No need to describe the physical contents... it's all done before this review. What we have here imho is very rare. These are compelling performances, beautifully recorded in live concerts, two in Tokyo and two in Dresden.
This is elastic Brahms, in the good way. It doesn't sound like the conductor's Brahms. It sounds like Brahms. If you understand the complex music of Brahms to any degree, you know that's all you want to hear. And I guarantee that's what is here.
My admiration for Christian Thielemann, which was always high, has just gone through the roof. Let's just say that the architecture of each symphony is evident from first to last note. This is the forest, not the trees!!",1402272000,12,689,4.75
8623596,5,B00GIPMCJI,"Brahms' Complete Symphonies is a boxed set of two Blu-ray discs, presenting Brahms' four symphonies as performed by the Staatskapelle Dresden under the direction of Christian Thielemann. This is the first offering from Thielemann following his triumphant conducting of Beethoven's nine symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic. In the Brahms' Complete Symphonies, the First and Third are performed in Tokyo's NHK Hall, while the Second and Fourth are from the Semperoper in Dresden. Both halls are very dimly lit, with the audiences virtually invisible. What little that can be seen of the setting in Tokyo is starkly modern, while that in Dresden is more ornately classical. In both cases the orchestra itself is well illuminated, and the video detail exceptionally sharp and revealing. Video quality of orchestral productions is now typically very good, and in this production the clarity of the image and the logic of the editing are both of the highest order.

Brahms was perhaps the finest symphonist in the era after Beethoven. Sensing in the works of Beethoven ""the tramp of a giant"" behind him, Brahms did not complete a symphony until he was a mature master of over forty years in age. The resultant First Symphony is widely regarded as the best first symphony by any composer. Brahms' contemporary Hans von Bulow, a respected pianist and conductor, declared it to be ""Beethoven's Tenth"". When someone mentioned to Brahms the striking similarity of a passage in his First Symphony to one in Beethoven's Ninth, the notoriously grumpy Brahms responded ""any ass can see that!""

Brahms' Second Symphony followed rapidly on the heels of the First, completed within a year of its predecessor. The Second featured a change in style, being notably relaxed and peaceful. It was the irascible composer in his most genial mood, and is one of the great treats of classical music. After a lapse of six years Brahms completed the Third Symphony, followed two years later by the Fourth, his last work in the symphonic mode. Each of the four symphonies is unique, beautifully crafted and completely enjoyable.

Brahms is one of a handful of composers whose works are so consistently pleasing that I periodically listen to their entire symphonic output in chronological order. Others in this group of personal favorites include Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, and Dvorak. This particular edition of the symphonies of Brahms is a sonic delight, and the excellent visuals allow a much greater understanding and enjoyment of the art and craft of producing fine music. It is an affirmation of the observation of British conductor Sir Adrian Boult, who said ""the modern symphony orchestra is one of the great achievements of western civilization.""",1397692800,21,2732,5.176470588235294
8623597,5,B00GIPMCJI,"what an outstanding collection of Brahms Symphonies. I am entering the Brahms world of music and I could not have chosen a better performance, both from the orchestra, as well as from this outstanding conductor. Audio and video quality are excellent.",1396656000,3,250,5.121951219512195
8623598,5,B00GIPMCJI,"In the bonus that comes with these wonderful performances, a monologue with the camera in which Thielemann talks for an hour about the symphonies, the conductor tells us that each symphony has, and I paraphrase, its own ""sound"".  The 4th Symphony, for example, evokes the first chill of autumn.  The third movement, he tells us, is Brahms being happy.  But, he qualifies, not happy as in merry, but more as in contentment, satiety.  The music, he says, is like the feeling, after a day at Oktoberfest.  ""The beer is good; you've just eaten some good pork knuckles, and you feel happy!""  In another place, he compares the feeling in the 2nd symphony to a summer day, when you've just emerged from the lake and you smell better than if you were wearing any perfume; you smell like lake-water.  Well.  Such metaphors are the result of a kind of inevitable inner-programming that Brahms and his followers campaigned so hard against in Wagner, for instance.  It's natural to paint mental pictures in music after Beethoven.  Mahler said it was impossible to avoid.  And happily, Thielemann's metaphors happen to coincide almost precisely with my own.  All right, I never thought of pig knuckles, but otherwise...

This, however, should not conceal the vigorously mindful approach that Thielemann takes with this music.  Even if you turn off the video, it is abundantly clear that every bar of every movement of all 4 works has been crafted with scholarly precision, total absorption, and genuine joy in the music making.  Look at him, almost motionless, communicating with the orchestra in tense, tiny movements and gestures. Watch him thanking just about every member of the orchestra in the curtain calls, and beaming at the audience. Turn the video on and you can watch him wrenching each phrase from the fine Dresden players with short, tense baton work and uncanny confidence.  If there are moments in the 2nd symphony where it seems just too easy, consider the work, which Thielemann suggests was reflective of Brahms taking a refreshing break from the torments of the First.  And it is there, for example, in the finale of the first symphony, a music that struggles with itself, to begin.  This struggle is so authentic in performance here, that one truly feels the anxiety building in the bones.  At last the theme emerges, hard won, and all the more ravishingly lyric for having been so hard won.

The only previous exposure I have had to Thielemann is his disastrous Vienna Ring.  But even there, the one continuously positive aspect of an otherwise troubled production, is the consistently wondrous playing by the Vienna orchestra.  I have read some criticism of his approach as being uptight, and overly meticulous.  One commenter indicted Theilemann for <<doing an impression of the relaxed energy  podium approach of Kleiber and Furtwangler.>>  I don't know what to make of such comments.  Such listeners seem determined to find fault.  Sometimes, I think people just say things like that because they won't let themselves just love something without reserve.  Anyway, this set is very welcome in my home.  The blu-ray video and surround sound sonics are rich and clear.  I have no complaints.",1394236800,23,3201,4.9736346516007535
