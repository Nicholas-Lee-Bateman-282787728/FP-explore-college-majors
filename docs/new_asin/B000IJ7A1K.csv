2658017,4,B000IJ7A1K,"I have to take exception to the comments of anyone who says this movie could only appeal to truly stupid and uneducated viewers because I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, and I am the exact opposite of stupid and uneducated.  Some pompous windbags apparently think any science fiction movie, particularly one of the global disaster variety, should be written by scientists to ensure that every single detail of the story is consistent with current scientific theories (ignoring the fact that no two scientists are ever going to agree on everything and will likely radically change those theories over time).  I for one don't mind having some actual fiction in my science fiction, as long as the story holds together on its own merits.  Even Carl Sagan's science fiction novel Contact goes far off the hard science reservation at the end.  Are the events found in this movie scientifically sound and believable?  No, but who the heck cares?  It's a great story that makes for one surprisingly exciting science fiction and geopolitical thrill ride.  Solar Attack (also known as Solar Strike) might even warm the cockles of Al Gore's fear mongering heart.  Global warming?  I've got your global warming right here, fellow.

As the title might suggest, the sun is mad as hell about something and isn't going to take it anymore.  The release of CMEs (coronal mass ejections) is nothing new, but all of a sudden our life-giving star is belching out, one right after the other, the veritable mothers of all CMEs.  The first sign of trouble comes when the solar probe designed to help watch for these things is incinerated in a heartbeat.  Then the privately-financed space plane launched by Lucas Foster (Mark Dacascos) is suddenly lost before it can begin its mission of measuring the levels of methane in the upper atmosphere.  Foster's global warming theories about methane gas buildup in the atmosphere led to his dismissal from the Solar and Near Earth Laboratory, but it looks like he may just get the last laugh now - although he may not have long to enjoy it.  Once he gets a look at the data coming in from the unprecedented solar storm - and learns from his former partner Joanna Parks (Joanne Kelly) that Earth's orbit will bring it right into the path of the oncoming CMEs - he predicts that the CMEs will penetrate the atmosphere through the holes in the ozone and ignite the unprecedented amount of methane in Earth's atmosphere.  If he's right, Earth is looking at a truly extinction level event.  The sky will literally catch on fire and burn around the globe, quickly sucking all of the oxygen from Earth's atmosphere and killing every living thing on the planet.

Earth's only hope for survival rests on this renegade scientist's shoulders.  Not only must Lucas find a way to divert disaster, he must also convince his exceedingly skeptical former boss and the president of the United States (Louis Gossett, Jr.) to believe what he is saying - and time is very much of the essence.  Complicating the problem, especially when communications satellites start falling out of the sky, is the tense relationship between the US and Russia.  With Russian nuclear submarines taking part in war games in the North Atlantic - under the watchful eye of their American underwater counterparts - the timing could not be worse for a complete loss of communication.

Obviously, a majority of reviewers hold this Sci-fi network original film in some measure of disdain, so I can't promise you that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.  It doesn't have a big budget or feature any well-known actors (apart from an admittedly underused Lou Gossett, Jr.), but I think the movie acquits itself quite well.  I actually think Mark Dacascos is a decent actor, and I think the storyline plays quite well as long as you suspend your disbelief and reject any urges to overanalyze the underlying science.  It's just a movie, and I say give it a chance - you might just enjoy it.",1235779200,10,3962,4.799705449189985

2658019,3,B000IJ7A1K,"The real problem is not sets, special effects or acting:
it is the plot science is just bad to really nonexistent!
These two points are just both false:
1) solar flares of coherent plasma
2) methane enough to combine with all the atmospheric oxygen
Other than that the submarine warfare was pretty good.
Blowing up the polar ice caps with nuclear missiles is
just a really bad idea, too.
It came real close to being a comedy
and would have been if the acting would have been worse than it was.
It isn't in the class of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"",
but just barely!",1206057600,12,568,4.419047619047619
2658020,3,B000IJ7A1K,"As a long time Sci-Fi fan, I found this film enjoyable, but derivitive.  The special effects were good, but not spectacular.  The acting was better than I first expected.  The story plot itself seems to be largely derived from Irwin Allen's original 1960 movie version of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", which is the better film in my opinion.",1203120000,2,346,4.639344262295082
2658021,2,B000IJ7A1K,"I may not be the biggest fan of disaster films, but this movie was even worse than most. The acting is very weak, and the story line is just too weak. I would have turned the movie off, if my husband wasn't one who watches any movie once. I laughed my way through most of it, and finally gave up to read a book. Though the story idea may be a good one and the actors chosen have done great work, this movie was a major let down. The time would be better spent reading. I hope the book was better.",1189641600,7,496,3.9207920792079207
2658022,2,B000IJ7A1K,"Made-for-TV film ""Solar Strike"" has little to add to the already overcrowded genre of disaster movies. This time the Earth is facing total destruction by CME, coronal mass ejection which is unstoppable huge flame coming from the Sun. Oh, and don't forget the dangerous methane gas in the air. Only Lucas Foster, maverick scientist knows the eminent danger and the solution of it too, but other scientists including his ex-love Joanna are not willing to listen.

The familiar premise and formulaic development of it is not a problem after all for all we want is thrill and action. Sadly ""Solar Strike"" has neither of them, with the terribly by-the-numbers script, wooden acting and OK effects. Had one of these been given more decent treatment, the film might have been a more entertaining sci-fi action. Mark Dacascos who was better in ""Brotherhood of the Wolf,"" is miscast as the scientist and Oscar winner Louis Gossett Jr. has nothing to do as president of America, except showing his worried face. Why not let them do something better than talking and worrying and staring at computer screens?

Though the story unfolds smoothly, the film itself doesn't have many action scenes. In fact, it is short on almost everything - short on effects, short on tension and logic. I know most Hollywood-made big-budget actions such as ""Armageddon"" actually don't have the last two items I mentioned, but at least they try to convince us of its credibility by giving us lots of actions. Except some satellites falling from the sky, very few disasters happen in ""Solar Strike"" and if they do, they are not exciting with so-so effects and cheap productions. And you also have to suspend your disbelief when the cleverest guy in the film is talking about the most incredible scientific theories about CME, Earth's atmosphere and ozone holes.

""Solar Strike"" is just OK. Not a bad way to kill time when you have absolutely nothing to do. But you know you have another, and possibly better way to do the same.",1181347200,3,1995,4.8617647058823525
2658023,4,B000IJ7A1K,"I have always loved the actors in this movie and was NOT disappointed in the movie stars.

2658095,3,B000IJ7A1K,"I have a great abiding love for disaster movies.  I'm constantly searching for movies that fall into this category.  My hope is that they will all prove entertaining enough that I will keep them for future enjoyment.  My criteria isn't so high that I expect sheer perfection with each offering.  In this particular case, most of the requisite elements are in play.  You have the sun spitting out globs of whatever, first destroying a cheaply made space shuttle trying to gather data on the ozone layer.  Soon satellites are dropping from the sky followed by a CME that destroys New Zealand.  The Earth is about to be snuffed out like a big candle.  The supposed hero of the piece (Mark Dacascos as Dr. Lucas Foster) delivers pronouncements by the bushel full.  He's a proponent of global warming.  He has an ex-wife scientist (Joanne Kelly as Dr. Joanna Parks) who thinks his theories are on the wrong side of daft.  She works for a naysayer who hates him.  It takes a while before people start pulling together in this crisis.  Belatedly, the problem is finally presented to a vacillating president (Louis Gossett Jr. in a bit part).  It's up to the Russians though, to solve the problem.  There's a submarine mini-battle tossed in for good measure.  It's all quite average and expected.  It was okay.  I wouldn't mind watching it again.  But it's nothing spectacular or all that exciting.  The ending is a foregone conclusion, following the sage advice..........when in doubt, blow something up.",1426723200,,1497,4.841897233201581

Can Lucas overcome all odds in the time restricted disaster? Or all we all doomed?

2658137,2,B000IJ7A1K,"Life on earth is threatened by the effects of huge solar explosions known as coronal mass ejections (CME's), in Solar Attack (2005), a direct to video production from Lions Gate, with a storyline that falls into a very familiar pattern.

Scientist and businessman Lucas Foster (Mark Dacascos) is involved in the study of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  When his space shuttlelike vehicle burns up in the upper atmosphere, while on a mission to measure methane levels, Foster becomes convinced that the planet faces impending disaster.  The CME's are penetrating the weakened ozone layer, and igniting methane in the upper atmosphere.  These fires in the sky, threaten to burn up all the oxygen on the planet, and extinguish all life on Earth.

After more areas of the sky catch on fire, and satellites begin to fall out of orbit and crash land, Foster presents his theory of impending destruction to the President (Louis Gossett Jr.).  As the situation worsens, communication becomes spotty, and more areas of the globe are destroyed.  Foster's proposed solution of detonating nuclear missiles at the North Pole, launched from a submarine, may be familiar to anyone that remembers the movie Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961).  While the US and Soviet governments dance around, time is running out, leaving Foster little option but to act on his own, to try and save the world.

Fortuitously, the commander of a Soviet submarine near the north pole, is Foster's personal friend, and he manages to get aboard, and convince his Russian comrade to fire his missiles.  After a ton of submarine related clichs, the missiles are finally launched, and the planet is spared.

Filled with clichs and elements that have been used before, Solar Attack isn't horrible, it's just unoriginal, predictable, and not terribly interesting or suspenseful, with production values similar to a Sy Fy production.  The special effects are not overdone, and are rather pedestrian.  Mark Dacascos and most of the cast do what they can with the material, but it's hard to take this film seriously.  If you are interested, you may want to tune in if you happen to see it on the Sy Fy schedule.",1295308800,,2175,4.9559228650137745
