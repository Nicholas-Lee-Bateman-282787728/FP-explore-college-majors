5046256,5,B0070B9S96,The show is so good..Its hard to come up with something different for these..All of the collections are so very good,1348099200,2,116,4.571428571428571
5046257,5,B0070B9S96,"Collinsport, Maine, is a fully realized little world, where time is not linear - it's especially jumbled on the Collinwood estate, a phenomenon intrepid viewers welcome. Catch the wonderful interview with John Karlen; he's a delight, a character on and off-screen; what an actor. There could be no other Willie Loomis. And the heroic journey of Ben Stokes is an indelible part of this laudable saga. His descendant is the civilized and erudite Professor Stokes, who attempts to help Victoria comprehend her journey back in time. If you admire the remarkable Thayer David, try:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-to-the-Center-of-the-Earth/dp/B00007JMD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>. I wish this portion of ""Dark Shadows"" contained more moments in the Collinsport Inn diner, its glossy cheeriness a momentary reprieve from the dogs howling in the perpetual darkness beyond the diner's windows. I crave Maggie's 1960s era grilled-cheese sandwiches, with white bread and slices of American cheese, and a side of tomato soup. Stock up on groceries to sustain yourself during your ""Dark Shadows"" journey. Professor Stokes can't be the only elegant large man, portly rotundity robed in silk before a cracking fire, to enjoy sherry and cheese. I prefer port, and recommend creamy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Havarti/dp/B004SASS34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Havarti</a>&nbsp;and aged&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kopke-Tawny-Port/dp/B005Z6MLVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kopke Tawny Port</a>.

Why is ""Dark Shadows"" so relaxing? Perhaps it's that the denizens of the murky environs of Collinsport aren't concerned with the normal things in life, even when they discover missing cows drained of blood. Val Lewton would have understood. Fritz Lang was a fan. These folks have special worries with things that go bump or bite or batty in the night. Jonathan Frid as the inimitable Barnabas Collins, Gentleman Vampire, walks the line with dignity, balancing hunger and desperate cruelty.

Adam runs amuck, and a fragile Carolyn is absconded with, dangling like a ragdoll from his paws. The clueless, hapless Roger Collins is married to Angelique/Cassandra; his marriages flop to the lopsided end of the stick, let's not forget Laura the Phoenix. Art is dangerous to Angelique, who tortures everyone with an awful dream-spell, artist Sam Evans never has it easy. Poor Maggie continues to be swayed by Josette's life, and the ghost of witch-hunter Reverend Trask seeks revenge upon Barnabas. The expressive Grayson Hall caws like a raven, loving Barnabas, we should all have such doctors on-call. As the epic saga unfolds, it's a treat to observe the details in Sy Tomashoff's amazing sets, and Ramse Mostoller's costumes. Through it all, Joan Bennett emotes with aplomb and glamour. Fritz Lang was an avid fan, having worked with the marvelous Bennett; Dan Curtis was inspired in ""Dark Shadows"" by Lang's film, starring Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Beyond-the-Door/dp/B0089LT800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Beyond the Door</a>. She just gets better as the series progresses, with her warmth and dry humor. What expressive wringing of hands, what a regal coiffure. And what courage on her part to commit to such an eccentric project as ""Dark Shadows."" I highly recommend Joan Bennett's other film noir masterpieces, such as the captivating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reckless-Moment/dp/B004A30AW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reckless Moment</a>, with James Mason. Mason's character was the inspiration for the Irish blackmailer, Jason McGuire. The underrated Bennett's deft talent and tremendous charisma boldly emerge in her films. How I wish Joan Bennett could have interviewed. The next collection (Alert: Box 9 has episodes very awkwardly directed by Sean Dhu Sullivan) contains Alexandra Moltke's gracious interview, where she gives Clarice Blackburn and Thayer David their due.

Robert Cobert's superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Soundtrack/dp/B000L43P4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;sets the mood for this languorous plunge into darkness. After hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and be comforted knowing this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again. I grew up in a haunted house on a ruined estate, with roads twisting into kudzu, mysterious gates in the woods, leading nowhere, and real live ghosts; I appreciate ""Dark Shadows."" An inexorable spell is cast on viewers, you'll find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over, unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport, be glad you stocked up on food and other supplies. The entire cast of this little horror troupe is theater at its best; they deserve credit for a remarkable achievement that proudly stands the test of time. The marvelous cast includes Alexandra Moltke, Nancy Barrett, Clarice Blackburn, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott (you may enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Return-to-Collinwood/dp/0938817663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: Return to Collinwood</a>), Humbert Allen Astredo, Joel Crothers, Roger Davis, Louis Edmonds, David Ford, Jonanthan Frid, Jerry Lacey, and Robert Rodan. The (child) actor David Henesy displays amazing talent. Enjoy getting lost in Collinsport's coastal fog, caught in the twisted tapestry of the immensely rewarding ""Dark Shadows.""

5046263,4,B0070B9S96,"It starts out with a Very weak begining 1st disc only. MY take of course! DVD in this collection shows characters too childish for my tastes.  I'm mean talk about over acting and hysteria please! They're all terrified after having their bad dreams more like nightmares.

I know their experiencing a (dream curse) caused by the black magic of the  witch Angelique. The 2nd through 4 th discs in this collection 8 are outstanding! Great dialogue, intrigue,suspense, you name it, it's there,nice plot lines. And best part no nonsense. Professor Stokes examines & mulles through this dream curse & figures out what to do. Brilliant! He Stokes looks at Maggie Evans dream aka (Night Mare) & interprets what course he should take & he actually figures out how to foil the curse so it won't be passed on to the next person & thus continue!  Very intriguing indeed!  Everyone who has this dream has night mares until they tell their dream to the next person. Then the night mare subsides.  Who will be the next victim of the dream curse? Watch this whole collection #8 to find out for yourself!

 Also Barnabas, finally must face the Reverend Trask and fess-up to his past crimes... Trask stages a mock trail  in the basement of the old house in which he summmons long dead Barnabas Collins victims' to accuse him & will Barnabas be found guilty or not of these past crimes? Does he hang from the gallows? Or ,does he have to endure some other dire fate that's in store for him?

Will he have to suffer the same exact fate that he bestowed on Reverend Trask ? Bricked up alive?  You can find out by buying this Dark Shadow's collection! This set or collection of dvd's certainly is not for the faint of heart.... 4 or 5 fang marks way up.

5046267,5,B0070B9S96,"just a brief note to say I had forgotten about the characters in this collection. as I watched then my mind went back to the small town in Missouri where I was raised when I would run home from school (my little sister and I) as always waiting for the the soap opera ro come on. this collection took me to that place. I also need to tell you that for a Christmas gift my grown children ordered collections 5, 6, and 7. I was so excited. thanks again amazon for my memories.",1391385600,,473,4.096774193548387

The colorized scenes seem foreign to me, but the stories are classic and I have a whole different viewpoint.

5046276,5,B0070B9S96,"These were some great episodes. This collection just flew by. I've watched from the beginning, and still going strong. Barnabas is sheltering a man-made monster named Adam. (Adam is basically like the Frankenstein monster, just better looking) Adam is probably one of my new favorite characters. Angelique has returned from the past and tries to put the Vampire curse back on Barnabas. Dr. Hoffman and Professor Stokes summon the ghost of Reverend Trask to hunt down and kill Angelique once and for all, but first, he wants revenge on Barnabas. Angelique has placed a dream curse on the friends of Barnabas. Whoever has it, will tell someone else about it, then they'll have it, too. The dream is silly, yet very gothic. There are different doors that lead to a skull, a guillotine, a laughing skeleton in a bride's dress, and more. So far, this is been one of my favorite collections. I highly recommend DARK SHADOWS: COLLECTION 8!!!",1353110400,,934,4.880503144654088
5046277,5,B0070B9S96,"In this collection, Dark Shadows moves further away from the Gothic theme into the present day with memories of Collinsport past interspersed with memories where Jeff Clark/Peter Bradford trying to find himself.
Here in present day, it seems much of the characters have come into reality and left insanity behind. Barnabus is living as a moral, living, breathing man, but dangling on a thin line. Even Barnabus' complexion looks more human. Roger, who is forever in the dark, loves his new wife Cassandra. The chest heaving, lip quivering Cassandra, the witch, continues to wreak havoc on whoever crosses her, or her path. Ah but she gets her comeuppance - for a while anyway. The ever loyal Maggie, Vicky and Julia remain loyal and dependable. I love the Professor Stokes, he is always the someone a person possessed or traumatized could run to for a cure. Adam, the ruggedly handsome man child Adam, with a volatile personality and limited vocabulary is making me grow on him. Poor Maggie Evans, Sam Evans and Joe Haskell - is all I can say. They never do anything wrong but bad things come their way. We also meet a new character, the ""devilish"" looking brother of Cassandra. Brother, hmmmm? I'm not too crazy about him....
If you have never seen a Dark Shadows episode, you may think it sounds crazy. I can assure you it is, but good crazy. It is addictive. Try it. Go ahead.",1348876800,2,1379,4.726141078838174
