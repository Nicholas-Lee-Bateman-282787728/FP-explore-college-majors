947595,4,630497342X,"I loved this movie. I know it's been bashed a lot by today's audiences, but you have to consider that when it was made special effects were not what  they are now.
I think it's the story that counts. My two cents anyway.
In addition, what also impresses me, is that several scenes and actors reapeared in ""Voyge to the Bottom of the Sea (series)"" and other Irwin allen productions. It's great to see earlier performances as well as the inevitable stock footage Irwin and Fox used.
Especially of note are really great performances of David(Al) Hedison (later Capt. Crane in Voyage), and Ms. Marcus (the native girl) who shows up later on Voyage both as the same native girl, and also as a love interest for a ghostly u-boat captain! I think it's rather fun to see the orig. movie while picking out 'hey-that was used over there'scenes)
As I said, the story itself is good. It's entertaining,and doesn't try  too hard.
I think it's worth the purchase and I'd like to see it released in widescreen format as it was originally shown. You miss some things in the regular format, but hey, it's not avail.in widescreen, so I'm just glad to have it at all. It hasn't been avai. for awhile at all.
I'd suggest you just settle down in a comfy chair and just enjoy it.",1088812800,7,1257,4.4847161572052405
947596,5,630497342X,"Poor Willis O'Brien was slated to do stop-motion spx for this film
but due budget oversights future ""Towering inferno"" director Irwin
Allen handed 20th Century Fox his 1st unintentional ""disaster"" film
Claude Rains who as the reknowned Professor Challenger leads the
cast including Michael Rennie,Jill St. John,David Hendison,Fernando
Lamas and ""frosty the poodle"" onto an amazon plateau where time is
frozen and prehistoric animals still exist. Their lives are put in
even more jeopardy when they find themselves stranded.
Dispite it's flaws,I still love this flim for what it tries to be
lavish epic with a supercast of characters, but will always be my
haunt is how at the time of production (released in 1960) could a
special effects crew STILL use the same standards from the early
matinee days of cinema.  Right down to the projected green spider
(Bert I.Gordon) when lower case B films such as ""lost contintent""
(1951)used stop-motion animation Maybe there was a time factor.
  The tape is excellent quality this Fox series also includes the
original trailer which is always a hoot for me but where is Fox's

947597,3,630497342X,"Personally I think this is a fun movie. Great Sunday afternoon fare. Sit down with some popcorn and relax for some brainless fun. The cast does well, and the sets are great. The dinosaurs were considered pretty good until Jurassic Park came along. They'll still do. You can't compare older movies to todays special effects power houses unless you want to be bored watching only a handful of great F/X movies. You need to watch some of these old ones that can be fun. Not quite as goofy as the Mystery Science Theater movies and not quite as serious as Jurassic Park III. If you like the ones like ""Valley of the Gwangi"", you will like it.",1037836800,14,638,4.461538461538462
947598,3,630497342X,"You can watch ""The Lost World"" one of two ways.
1) A maddeningly poor version of the great Arthur Conan Doyle novel, turning memorable characters into crude stereotypes, and adding a half-dozen others so you won't notice there's only one brief sequence featuring ""dinosaurs"" (magnified lizards with rubber collars, tortured into listlessly attacking each other).
2) As an early '60s camp fest, what with the babealicious cave girl, Fernando ""you look mahvelous"" Lamas as a vengeful native, and Claude Rains as a peppery pipsqueak Professor Challenger -- not to mention Irwin Allen's trademark colored-lights-on-styrofoam special effects. Best of all, Jill St. John (an Annette Bening without irony) in her pink boots, who announces ""I can ride, fly, and shoot better than any man I know"" and then spends the balance of the movie shrieking and running for the strong arms of David ""Al"" Hedison. Or is it Al ""David"" Hedison?
Anyway, stick with the sweet, rather innocent 1925 silent version... Conan Doyle loved it and it's still miles ahead of every subsequent ""Lost World"" movie -- including the recent Bob Hoskins ""ecologically correct"" CGI fiasco.",960595200,13,1149,5.216216216216216

947916,4,630497342X,"One of my all time favorite films...when I was a child. I would have been 5 and a wee bit too young to have appreciated this version of ""The Lost World,"" way back in 1960. However, whenever  it was shown on TV, it was one of the highlights of the year. TV just didn't get any better than this, to a young boy in those days.

Fifty-six years after it's release, I must admit, it's lots of fun, but pretty silly. It doesn't appear that anyone involved in this production took it very seriously, beyond making it a top quality, entertaining, 90 minute escape from everyday life, for the whole family.

I see no point in explaining how great or ridiculous it is. I suspect that the vast majority of people who are interested in watching it these days are those who are looking for a fond trip down memory lane. On that, it delivers. Young viewers are bound to find the pace too slow and boring, the acting ridiculously corny, and the special effects an unfunny joke. That's cool. Fifty years from now, kids will laugh at the favorite films of their childhood.",1470441600,4,1055,4.427835051546392

948121,5,630497342X,"I purchased the Blu-ray version imported from Spain. The cover show the title in Spanish, ""El Mundo Perdodo"". The Spanish import version is an all-region version, whereas the other Blu-ray edition that can be purchased is region-specific and will not play in players sold in North America.

I previously owned a DVD copy of ""The Lost World"", and the technical quality was awful to say the least. It wasn't due to the DVD format - the DVD format is easily capable of providing video quality substantially better that what was presented on that DVD. It is anyone's guess how that DVD was produced, but my guess is that it was made from some old videotape, probably not VHS or Beta, but more likely one that had been produced for local TV stations to use. I'm only guessing, but you get the point.

No noteworthy technical problems with this Blu-ray edition, and I am thankful for a high-quality copy of this old favorite. I also appreciated the fact that the way it was done in regards to menu was kept very simple, in contrast with many Blu-ray discs that were produced by someone who could not resist taking advantage of every possible feature of the Sony format only to end up with something that is annoying to a lot of people. There are a few places where at first I thought there was maybe a slight degradation in hue and saturation, along with contrast, but more typically the contrast and saturation are excellent. I was forced to conclude that this is how it appeared when originally shown in theaters, i.e., it was simply the way some of the scenes were photographed. In any case, the video quality is EXCELLENT. In terms of sharpness and detail, it holds it own against some of the better Blu-ray discs I own. And there aren't any issues with sound. Perfectly clear from start to finish, with good dynamic range, and I never had any difficulty making out the dialog, which contrasts sharply with almost all of the stuff that you get on television nowadays. The default audio track is a Spanish dub, but you merely have to select audio track #2, which is the original English, and in stereo. All in all a true joy that met all expectations and did not disappoint in any way. In fact, this old favorite that I could barely stand to watch on that horrible DVD is now one of my very favorites in my modest Blu-ray collection. In the interest of completeness I should probably also mention Jill St. John. After the helicopter lands, she steps out and hands her little poodle to one of the men standing outside, then steps out wearing that long yellow dress, unbuttoned in front to the waist and wearing a matching pair of short shorts underneath.

And where was the ASPCA during this filming?  They had a 'gator and a monitor lizard fighting and tearing at each other, with what looked to be real malice. I'll bet there was no notice about no animal being harmed during the filming!

Don't waste your time.  Even the 1992 version with Jonathan Rhys-Davies was better (although they transported the action to the continent of Africa, instead of the original location, South America.)

While the acting ranged from laughable to mediocre, it was Irwin Allen's direction and notorious cheap special effects budget that ruined it for me.  The photography was actually quite good, and I didn't mind he used lizards and baby alligators with horns and scales attached to them, to pass off as dinosaurs, but his constant over-use of the same cheesy sound effects and choppy editing during monster scenes really ruined all my beloved childhood memories.  The worst being the end scene, when a clearly four-legged baby lizard pops out of a dropped ""dinosaur"" egg and Claude Rains' character calls it a baby T-rex...King of the Dinosaurs!  Anyway, it had a surplus of 50's/60's B-movie stars, and the story itself wasn't bad, just badly executed.

An eccentric scientist Prof. George Edward Challenger [Claude Rains] returns from the Amazon with news of a distant plateau where creatures from the dawn of time still prowl the jungle.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The theatrical release of Irwin Allens THE LOST WORLD [1960] must have been a dream come true, for fans of this type of genre film. Especially with a brand new breath-taking spectacular CinemaScope adventure in Color by Deluxe with an all-star cast and, most importantly, dinosaurs! The timing was certainly right. Universal had just three years previously begun releasing their great classic horror films to television for the first time. A monster fad was started, horror hosts in seemingly every major and some minor cities, bubble-gum collectors cards at every register checkout, magazines devoted to cinematic horror on every magazine stand, and plastic model replicas of the most famous movie monsters in every hobby and toy store. Now, every Monster fan can own this brilliant 1960 versions of THE LOST WORLD on this 20th Century Fox / 101 Films Region B/2 Blu-ray release.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyles 1913 novel, The Lost World, tells the tale of Professor Challenger and his discovery of a tropical plateau where evolution has ceased and dinosaurs continue to proliferate. The book had been brought to the cinema screen (officially) only once before, in the now famously 1925 film starring screen legends Wallace Beery [Prof. George Edward Challenger] and Lewis Stone [Lord John Roxton]. It was one of the biggest hits of the silent film era; THE LOST WORLD employed the art of stop motion animation to depict the prehistoric denizens. Although stop motion had been employed sporadically in the past, this more realistic use of the process was as every bit as startling and captivating to the public as JURASSIC PARK [1993] would be to later audiences.

With director Irwin Allens film it bears almost no resemblance to Sir Arthur Conan Doyles novel, but despite this, we have a lot of fun and big adventure along the way with this film version of the novel. Prof. George Edward Challenger [Claude Rains] arrives in London to give a lecture on his latest discovery, the existence of dinosaurs in South America. Rather quickly, an expedition is financed by reporter Ed Malones [David Hedison] newspaper publisher with the proviso that he and great white hunter Lord John Roxton  [Michael Rennie]  accompany the Professor and his scientific nemesis Prof. Summerlee  [Richard Haydn].

In short time they are in South America with their local guides Manuel Gomez [Fernando Llamas and Costa [Jay Novello]. Once on the plateau their helicopter is destroyed by a dinosaur stranding them in a Lost World. They encounter a big green spider, a beautiful native girl, and her tribe. Diamonds figure into the plot, also.

Claude Rains is a good Prof. George Edward Challenger, if a bit older than Wallace Beery in the original film. Prof. George Edward Challengers blustery and bombastic, his red hair adding to the concept that hes under pressure and ready to explode. Michael Rennie makes a fine Lord John Roxton, younger than Lewis Stone. And David Hedison as Ed Malone is easily as good as Lloyd Bacon. Richard Hayden as Prof. Summerlee (the poor mans Clifton Webb) is his usual supercilious self, a role that typecast him but was employed perfectly in the TV series THE TWILIGHT ZONE in the episode A Thing About Machines. Fernando Llamas as Manuel Gomez plays his role as the guide with a dark earnestness while Jay Novello as Costa provides some humour as the comic coward.

Jennifer Holmes [Jill St. John], as the daughter of the backer of this junket, as lovely as she is, dressed in tight-fitting fuchsia pants and is as out of place here as a manikin in a mud hole, is simply a ridiculous presence in her pink stretch pants and booties. The poodle doesnt help, either. One amusing scene occurs when her poodle wanders off only to confront a big dinosaur. Somehow, JJill St. John doesnt see the giant lizard until she picks up the dog. And when she does she stands frozen in terror, her screaming bringing the others to save her.

The two return to an empty camp. Natives must have captured everyone. Except for the poodle of course. And David Hedison who explains that they appeared from above oops, there's more. These remaining campers are taken prisoner, join the others in a cave, and prepare to die in a cannibalistic ritual after the drum solo. Creature-girl offers a way out, so off through a cavern of wind with natives in lukewarm pursuit we go. We stumble on Burton White [Ian Wolfe], now blind, who doesn't want to go with us and who tells Manuel Gomez that Santiago is dead. White gives out more guns and instructs us on directions through the caves to escape the altar of sacrifice to the fire god. We trek through lava caves and through the tendrils of grasping slime, into the graveyard of the damned, where dinosaur eggs and diamonds are discovered. Manuel Gomez pulls a gun, saying Santiago was his brother and he wants to kill Lord John Roxton. A dinosaur appears out of a lake and eats the other  Spaniard, and somehow Lord John Roxton saves Manuel Gomez, who then runs to sacrifice his life yanking on a log which somehow unleashes rocks and lava onto the dinosaur (but wouldn't the log . . . never mind). Manuel Gomez falls into the sea of hot lava goo.

Despite the use of lizards and alligators decked out with fins, the dinosaurs are kind of fun on their own level. It was a thrill back in the day to watch them battle each other but now its just animal cruelty. Still, there are some nice tracking shots as one of them moves through the jungle and the scene with Jill St. John is nicely composed and composited. Also, the water monster that appears late in the picture is fairly cool, too, until they jam a human puppet down its throat. What really carrys these images are the booming sound effects. These dinosaurs roar magnificently in impressive stereo. Of course its strictly comical to hear these lizards referred to as a Brontosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.

Later, the group find a cavern to use as their sleeping quarters (what happened to all the camping equipment they brought along?). A cosy fire and some nice fluffy ferns bring them all the comforts of home... but the good times don't last for long. The head-hunters come and get them and carry them off to their Easter Island inspired lair. Here plenty of bones give us the hint of what's to become of our leading players. These guys obviously can't wait for supper. Grandpa Longhair likes the large white bones best it seems. Through the help of the shapely native girl, they are led away from the head-hunters and taken to their old abandoned pal Burton White, who tells them the secret to escaping from the soon-to-be-erupting caverns.

They quickly take the advice of blind man Burton White (why not? what have they got to lose...except their heads) and journey to the  Cave of Fire, the only passage that will take them out of the plateau. The natives believe this is the altar to their fire god and are too scared to pass it... but they give them a good chase nonetheless. Here we see the grandest of the sets so far, this one sporting old dinosaur shells, spewing fires, and plenty of sooty smoke. Of course, a passageway like this can only mean one thing... That is...a dinosaur. This fella seems to enjoy the lava bath that he gets just before the film's ending, unlike Prof. George Edward Challenger whos hanging on the brink of being boiled.

The rest emerge in time to see the plateau blow up volcanically. Prof. George Edward Challenger laments: ""My lost world, lost forever."" However, they did manage to save proof of their adventure: Lord John Roxton has diamonds which he gives to Ed Malone and Jennifer who now are on the marriage track somehow (""Mrs. is still the best 'title' for a girl""); and the dinosaur egg hatches a tyrannosaur which Challenger predicts will grow big enough to wreak havoc on London, at which point they should all move out. Ho! Ho! Ho! The End. Unlike the 1925 film, which brings the Brontosaurus to London and lets it wreak havoc on the city, this films ends with the hatching of a dinosaur egg? It seemed to promise a sequel but one was not forthcoming. THE LOST WORLD [1960] was another let's-go-on-a-scientific-expedition classic. This film was also released by 20th Century Fox but unlike THE LOST WORLD features sets that bear the quality mark of the studios head of the art department, Lyle Wheeler.

Blu-ray Video Quality  101 Films has finally released in the UK Blu-ray Release in an impressive 1080p transfer, there is a bit of softness and some noise scattered in the open sky shots but the Color by Deluxe are surprisingly rich. It has an equally impressive 2.35:1 [CinemaScope] aspect ratio that provides as good a presentation as I've seen for the star-studded adventure hoot. It's clean without damage or speckles. I'd say this Blu-ray image is looking better than I anticipated. I can confirm with this particular Blu-ray disc is equal to or even superior to other Blu-ray discs that have been released. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  101 Films has finally released in the UK Blu-ray Release in an impressive 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio sound mix features outstanding and surprisingly gripping bass levels heard almost from the beginning and notable throughout. Dialogue has been spread across the front soundstage rather than being done directionally, but its always clear and precise. And the rear surround channel carries some interesting sound effects with water and waves swirling, heavy winds whirling, and avalanche-pounding rock slides being especially notable. Bert Shefter and Paul Sawtells music score gets woven impressively throughout the entire two channel sound mix experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Sadly there are no extras on this Blu-ray disc, which I do not understand, as in the vaults of 20th Century Fox, they must have loads of outtakes and interviews and comments from the director, actors and crew. Shame on you 101 Films.

Finally, ""In the middle of the Twentieth Century, you fall off the brink of time!"" was what the poster's tagline claimed. The audience never really does fall off the brink like the lizards do, but the film's characters have a number of great jungle settings to trip their feet over. Nevertheless, in spite of the paper-mache caverns and feather-light boulders, Duncan Cramer and Walter M. Simons' sets feature some creative designs that really do transport us into Professor Challenger's lost world. Sometimes cheap and cheerful, sometimes full of fun and frolics, all things considered, there's a good time to be had for the discerning creature feature/fantasy adventure film THE LOST WORLD [1960], which I am a massive fan of this film. Highly Recommended!

Plus one silent film: the 1925 version. Which is odd: the 1925 version appears to be the Film Preservation Associates version, but the DVD appears to have too early a date. It definitely is more than just the action sequences, however.
It also has a stereotyped African American character (his dialogue cards are more stereotyped than his behavior); however, he appears to be the origin of the greedy storekeeper in the 1960 film, who seems to be a greedy man and not a stereotype.
The 1925 does have actual dinosaurs and even includes the frame of the novel: here, too, the newspaperman goes on the expedition because his One True Love will only marry someone who has adventures, only to return to find that she has married a bank clerk.
The 1960 version omits this framing device and also the dinosaurs: instead, we get what look to me an awful lot like iguanas, although the actual species may be different. This actually works pretty well, unless the viewer gets really uptight, and would have helped a lot if the references to ""dinosaurs"" in the script had been changed to ""really large lizards"". Still, the dino-on-dino fight scenes have the quickest action I have ever seen in this sort of film from the pre-CGI age, although what the SPCA thought about it is anybody's guess.",1443916800,,1427,4.666666666666667

A transatlantic airplane lands in London. A bearded cranky professor meets the press. Reporter Ed Malone meets Jennifer Holmes. Professor George Edward Challenger speaks at the Zoological Institute. [People smoke in the audience.] Professor Challenger returned from a trip to the Amazon headwaters. He made a big discovery: there are creatures believed to be extinct. Live dinosaurs! He wants another expedition, but they need financing and volunteers. Lord Roxbury volunteers, so does Edward Malone. Money talks! Sensational news sells newspapers. The group arrives at their destination. There are two more volunteers. Malone talks to Roxton. Has anyone lived to tell abut this strange land? Their helicopter flies to this strange land.

They approach the plateau and land. Men are armed with rifles and a camera. Night falls, they camp in the open. They hear noises, a large beast approaches, they hide. Their helicopter is wrecked! Challenger won't escape until they see a dinosaur. They find paw prints, then a dinosaur. They see a young woman running, Malone follows. A huge green spider is a threat. Can they find a way off the plateau? There is conflict between two men. They find Burton Whites diary, it tells of diamonds. God help us all! Roxtons interest is financial (diamonds). There are unfriendly natives as well as dinosaurs. There is an incident. Gomez walks away and is attacked; he loses his rifle. Where is that girl? Then they see a dinosaur! Are they trapped? Another dinosaur appears to attack the first! The struggle ends when they fall over a cliff.

They find trouble when they return to camp. The natives aren't friendly to these illegal immigrants. They are taken to their camp. What do we do now, Professor? That young woman leads them out of capture. They find Burton White in a cave, alive but blind, the sole survivor. He tells them of a way to escape, otherwise they will be killed! The natives pursue them. They pass through dangerous places (to add drama). Hurry! They arrive outside to safety. There is one more barrier. They find diamonds. Im rich forever! But there is a problem with Gomez. A dinosaur ends the argument. Two men open the dam of lava! This allows the survivors to escape, but the Lost World is lost forever. Can they take a baby dinosaur back to London?

This is an about average story, the actors do not improve it. Modern Computer Generated Images will create better pictures (as in Jurassic Park). I never read the book so I cant tell how well the movie follows the book. If dinosaurs were killed off in an Ice Age how did these survive? The idea that they continued to exist is interesting. The Amazon river was then as unknown as the dark side of the moon. There is a financial motivation for explorations but its not only diamonds. There are other resources that are valuable (oil and other mineral wealth). Conflicts over these may lead to wars.",1441152000,,2932,4.846307385229541

948977,3,630497342X,"Arthur Conan Doyle's tale of Jurassic daring-do on top of an Amazonian plateau where time hasn't changed for millennia was always going to be a Hollywood blockbuster with big lizards, big bosomed women and even bigger cowards. And 1960's ""The Lost World"" brought to the screen with aplomb in glorious De Luxe Colour by Irwin Allen is fondly remembered to this day as half-decent Sunday afternoon prehistoric blubber. And rewatching it in 2015 you can only say what a hoot these CinemaScope movies were  and that of course is half the pleasure!

Part of 101 Films' Series ""The Cult Movie Collection""  this 2015 British BLU RAY print is fully restored and looks fantastic...even if the disc is woefully lacking in extras (the box has the English language title and English poster art which are different to  the Euro one displayed by Amazon). Let's get to the story first...

Stepping off a TWA 707 at London Heathrow Airport (how very modern) only to be mobbed by squabbling press hacks  Professor George Edward Challenger is infuriated at his invasion of privacy (Claude Rains hamming it wonderfully). Flustered in a way that only a mad Professor can be - he prompted shouts ""Buffoons! Imbeciles!"" and whacks one of them on the head with his umbrella sending the hapless chap reeling down the flight steps into a puddle of English water (too damn right). That poor sucker is Reporter Edward Malone - David Hedison of ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" fame and James Bond's US contact Felix Leiter. Malone works for Global News Service and only wants the skinny on the Professor's secretive but sensational expedition in South America (hes flown in to address the London Zoological Society that evening). At least our Ed meets the shapely Jennifer Holmes (Jill St. John doing her best Monroe) who turns out to be the daughter of his boss at Global News. Shame however that shes trying to hitch big-game hunter and explorer Lord John Roxton (a suitably dapper Michael Rennie of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" fame)  so our Ed will have to wait for clinches on the plateau much later.

Once at the conference  Challenger tells a captivated but dubious audience that hes made the greatest scientific breakthrough ever. At the headwaters deep in the Amazon Rain Forest he has seen creatures that can only be described as 'live dinosaurs' cut off from the world on an isolated plateau  a 'lost world' so to speak. Professor Summerlee of the Zoological Society (a great comedy role for Richard Haydn) who constantly spars with Professor Challenger and feels him prone to exaggeration  poo poos some hokum  only to have $100,000 dollars thrown at them by Jennifers bullish father who wants the story and of course the exclusive pictures. Reluctantly they all agree  an expedition must be mounted - and a month later the unlikely and ill-prepared motley crew head off in a biplane to the unchartered wilds of the Amazon...picking up a few stragglers en-route...

On landing they meet a virile all-singing all-playing guitar-hugging Helicopter Pilot called Gomez (Fernando Lamas) and his bug-eyed but cowardly sidekick Costa (Jay Novello) - and once up on the plateau  another native nubile - only this time in a fetching loincloth (the gorgeous Vitina Marcus). Naturally the dinosaurs and vegetation all throw Prehistoric wobblies at these intruders which in turn illicits lots of screaming and fainting and manly heroics - followed by cigarettes and deep gazing and hugely insightful statements like ""Do you think we'll be alright Professor?"". But as sure as God made little green Terrydactyls  all Hell breaks loose and soon they need to exit this geologically unstable 'lost world' before they get eaten or swallowed by molten lava...

The print is in fabulous shape  quite clearly cleaned up to its very best. Certain scenes extenuate this  at the airport  the arrival of the seaplane - Jill St. Johns ridiculous parade of ill-fitting costumes and white leather boots  even the reptiles and lizards that double-up as Prehistoric creatures look good. A real shame however is the complete lack of extras  merely 8 chapter headings and thats it. What a missed opportunity and docked a star.

""The Lost World"" isn't as good as say ""The Time Machine"" or even ""Fantastic Voyage"" but it has its hammy charms. That said   if youve any love for this dated but hugely loveable kind of film  then this great-looking BLU RAY reissue will tickle your inner explorer...and right nicely too...",1440374400,,4474,4.939919893190921

948981,5,630497342X,"Loosely based on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic tale, this family friendly version offers more humor than horror as a band of explorers tangle with all manner of reconstructed prehistoric monsters and cannibals.  The cast ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime.  Actors Claude Rains, Richard Haydn, and Michael Rennie manage to redeem themselves and their reputations, the rest struggle to keep up with their betters.  Claude Rains has the flashiest role as the pugnacious Professor Challenger who won't suffer journalists while actively seeking to gain the limelight.  He assaults and insults with equal measure.  The world must know of his tremendous find.....a plateau where dinosaurs still rule, albeit from a safe distance.  He's seen them from afar and heard them.  But of proof, he has none.  All his evidence was conveniently lost.  Not willing to have his reputation repudiated, he puts he name to good use and challenges any and all who would accompany him back to `his' lost world.  With an ulterior motive, Lord Roxton (Michael Rennie) readily accepts his offer as does a pesky reporter Ed Malone (David Hedison).  Less enthusiastic, his rival, Professor Summerlee (Richard Haydn), also agrees to attend the doomed expedition.  With more beauty than brains, Jill St. John (as Jennifer Holmes) demands to go along, bragging she can outdo men in practically everything, then spends the bulk of the expedition screaming, more a hindrance than a help, wearing one ridiculous outfit after another, with a poodle as an accessory!!!  Somewhere along the way diamonds feature heavily.  As adventure films go, it's about par for the course.  It's an affable journey with few surprises.  It scores high due to nostalgia (I was a kid when I first saw it).  Arguably, the better version of this story is also offered here on a separate disk.  The 1925 silent version, starring Wallace Beery as Professor Challenger, featuring the timeless stop motion special effects by Willis O'Brien.

I can even study the words used in the movies, define them and enhance my own understanding of our mixed cultural nation, continuing the journey of a 70s child, exploring the world.

When approached  to supervise the special effects for the 1960s remake Willis O'Brian had hoped to use traditional  ""table top"" animation for the  dinosaurs as he had done previously in his 1925 silent version of ""The Lost World"" and his 1933  ""King Kong.""

As that still hasn't happened, I finally broke down & bought this edition to find out just what it is & in hopes it was an upgrade from what I already had. It turns out it is a 3rd version, also done by Eastman! And if I had known what I know now from watching it, I would have bought this in 2007.

Of the prior versions, the Eastman was by far the best looking (taken almost completely from 35 mm negatives), but was only 64 minutes. It does have a number of interesting extras, though.

Then came David Sheppard's 132 minute Image, which now sells for Mega bucks. It's 132 minutes, & while the picture quality is far superior to any pd edition, it's definitely inferior to the much shorter Lumivision (for today's ridiculously low price, pick up the LumiVision whether you buy this or not!)

I did extensive comparisons several years ago between  the 2 older versions. I'm not prepared to do another full A-B (& C for that matter!) comparison, but I have a pretty good memory of how the other 2 look.

The version on this set is 116 minutes (16 minutes shorter than the Sheppard), but has 7 minutes of additional out takes. It was done by Eastman, and it does rival the Lumivision in a significant portion. Some of the segments look like they're from a 50's film (I mean that in a very positive manner); the restoration is that good. Other sections don't look as good (guys, I've seen what scratch reduction can do, both digital & analog; why wasn't that done here?), but most of it does look better than the Sheppard.  Like the Sheppard, it states it was compiled from numerous different prints. Unlike the Sheppard/Image they state where the 5 different prints came from, (Sheppard states he worked from 8 prints of unspecified origin) & that it was restored by Eastman House, who tend to do better work then Sheppard. (Meant more as a compliment to Eastman House than as a slam to Sheppard).

Between price & quality, this would seem to be the one to own; though as a collector I frustratingly plan to keep the other 2 also:  the Lumivsion for the extras, & the Image for the extra length (though it is also POSSIBLE that the Image version was mastered at a slower frame rate.).

I'm assuming you have at least some knowledge of the history & importance of the 1925; or you likely wouldn't be reading this, so I'm not going to explain in any depth. I will state that this was the first MAJOR stop motion made by King King's Willis O'Brien, which is the #1 reason for it's importance. It's also a fun watch!

I've never seen the 1960 before. I'm about 1/2 way through as I write this. I'm finding it mildly entertaining, but not in the same league as the 1925. Does anyone know which version is more true to the original book?",1396569600,2,3184,4.943820224719101

The dinosaurs are a collection of modern day reptiles, monitor lizards, and caimans, all filmed giant-sized with fake horns and fins to make them appear like prehistoric dino's.  Mid-way through the movie there are some Amazonian natives who made their way to the plateau eons ago and are now stuck there.  Of course some Anglo adventurers drop in to explore and find more than they can handle.  The actors include the always welcome Claude Rains and Michael Rennie.  Rennie's character turns out not to be a coward but more of a laid-back jerk who sort-of redeems himself.  Jill St. John's character is the most annoying, but in keeping with late 50s and early 60s mentality.  She is described as a great shot and as brave as a lioness, but the minute she sees a dino she promptly drops her gun, clutches up her ridiculous poodle and screams her lungs out.  Her wardrobe is also dumb for a safari.  Silk, periwinkle blue lounging PJs and baby pink pants and boots.

949377,3,630497342X,"[This is a review about the 1960 version of ""The Lost World"" produced and directed by Irwin Allen.]

The name of Irwin Allen brings back good old memories of so-called ""disaster movies"" popular back in the 1970 -bloated but still enjoyable productions with all-star cast. Before making such films as ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" he has directed several films himself including the 1960 version of ""The Lost World."" This is not totally a bad film, and the cast is very interesting, but Allen's rendition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure tale lacks something - budget and, more importantly, imagination.

The story is loosely based on the original book published in 1912. To prove his epoch-making discovery, Professor Challenger (Claude Rains with a beard) and his team travel deep into the Amazon plateau, where he claims prehistoric creatures still prowl in the jungle. As the film is set in modern times, his expedition team goes to the Amazon by airplane and helicopter. Not exactly a thrilling build-up to the adventure tale.

Anyway, in addition to the main characters from the original - a renowned hunter Lord John Roxton (Michael Rennie, ""Klaatu"" of the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""), a newspaper journalist Edward Malone (David Hedison) and Challenger's rival Professor Summerlee (Richard Haydn) - we get three additional characters for the film including a socialite Jennifer Holmes (Jill St. John). Oh, and I almost forgot her dog (a poodle, not a Chihuahua).

I was pretty impressed with the special effects using live lizards (with some horns attached), but no matter how the film tires, they are lizards and they look like ones. Acting is decent, if not special, but the film's drawn-out storyline and one subplot about the helicopter pilot need improvement. As to the adventures or actions described here, compared to ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" that precedes Allen's film by one year, ""The Lost World"" lacks suspense and imagination.

But I still like the film for what it is - an old-fashioned adventure film. Maybe this is not a classic, but still worth your time especially if you enjoyed the director's past works like me.",1298678400,3,2200,5.049586776859504

Director Irwin Allen handles the 1960 version, which is short on special effects, but has a solid cast: Claude Rains and Michael Rennie portraying anthropologists Prof. George E. Challenger and Lord John Roxton, respectively, David Hedison as newspaper reporter Ed Malone and Jill St. John as Jennifer Holmes, the daughter of a top newspaper executive.

Challenger is in pursuit of the mysterious surrounding the land that takes the world back to millions of years ago, while Roxton is snooping around for clues concerning the mysterious disappearance of a great explorer. And their lives get real difficult when they become stranded in this land of man-eaters. The film placed fifth in the Top Action Drama category for the 1961 Laurel Awards, which were published in Motion Picture Exhibitor magazine.

949532,3,630497342X,"Irwin Allen's 1960 version of The Lost World may be shot in CinemaScope, but stylistically it fits right in with his 60s sci-fi TV shows (indeed, stock footage from the film found its way into his Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea series, as did co-star David Hedison). Originally intended to feature state-of-the-art stop-motion animation from Willis O. Brien, the special effects genius behind the groundbreaking 1925 version as well as King Kong, the ever-economical producer opted instead for the tried and trusted and, most important of all, much cheaper technique of supergluing fins and horns on real lizards and having them double for dinosaurs despite looking like nothing so much as lizards with fins and horns superglued on them. However, even had he spent the extra time and money, this modernised version was never going to be the definitive one: 'dinosaur' action is fairly thin on the ground and the novel's finale that sees a pterodactyl on the loose in London is unceremoniously dropped. Instead there's a lot of wandering around the Fox ranch and backlot, cameo appearances from the odd poisonous giant plant left over from Journey to the Center of the Earth, a tribe of natives with a yen for human sacrifice, a fortune in diamonds and the obligatory erupting volcano finale, though it retains a certain nostalgic Saturday kids matin&eacute;e appeal even if most of today's kids wouldn't sit still for it. Claude Rains gets to grandstand as Professor Challenger while Michael Rennie's aristocratic big game hunter seems almost like a blueprint for George Lazenby's take on James Bond, with Jill St. John tagging along for no good reason other than Arthur Conan Doyle's thoughtless failure to provide any female roles in the original novel.

Fox's new Region 1 NTSC DVD boasts a fine 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, but the stereo tracks are reversed so that the left comes from the right speaker and vice versa. Along with original trailer, brief featurette, Movietone newsreel footage of a kids charity screening and a still gallery that's irritatingly locked so you can't fast-forward or reverse but have to play at normal speed for nine minutes (!), it also comes with the original 1925 silent version (which was, coincidentally, the first ever in-flight movie). Unfortunately it's not the relatively recently restored 93-minute version that's available separately but the 75-minute version preserved by George Eastman House. For many years the longest version available after multiple cuts for reissues as the film's ownership changed hands several times over the decades, for the more casual viewer it's still a welcome addition and offers a decent tinted print.

Willis O. Brien's special effects are still surprisingly good and way ahead of the 1960 version even if he was to perfect them further in King Kong (for which this film feels almost like a dress rehearsal at times), giving the film an epic scale in the volcanic eruption and stampede sequences, while Wallace Beery is a perfect choice for Professor Challenger, embodying the gruff, belligerent nature of the character to a tee. There are changes to the novel - not only is Bessie Love brought along on the expedition to search for her lost father (with none of the comic relief chauvinism from Challenger found in the 1960 version) but the pterodactyl that terrifies the streets of London has been changed to a lumbering Brontosaurus, which is certainly a change for the better - but then Doyle's book is rather light on plot to begin with. The dinosaurs aren't as well integrated into the story as you might hope - usually it's cutaways to herds of dinosaurs in their natural habitat - and the racial stereotyping from Jules Cowles' blackface routine as `Zambo' is painfully embarrassing and horribly unfunny (sample dialogue on seeing campfire smoke from the plateau: ""That means our folks is still alive."" ""It MAY mean dat some of those cannibules dat drop dat rock down on us yistiddy am cookin' `em in dar stew-pot!""). But it's hard not to like a film with dialogue like ""What are you thinking of, Paula - in this lost world of ours?"" or Challenger's immortal ""My brontosaurus has escaped! Keep off the streets - until I recapture it!"" and where our hero's rival for his girl back home's affections is called Percy Bumberry!

949589,4,630497342X,"""How bad can it be?"" asked one reviewer here.  The answer is ""Pretty bad.""  This is probably the worst adaptation done of Conan-Doyle's classic novel, primarily because producer/director Irwin Allen's approach was so juvenile, but I doubt the movie was meant to be more than a Saturday matinee feature.  It looks and feels cheap, with lizards and baby alligators used as stand-ins for dinosaurs.  One of the effects technicians was -- unbelievably -- Willis ""King Kong"" O'Brien, who also worked on the classic 1925 silent version of ""Lost World.""  This must have been a very depressing experience for him.  I know that one of the film's star's, David Hedison, has said several times that he was depressed making this movie.  All that said, if you saw this as a small kid, you probably have fond nostalgic memories of it, and it can be enjoyed on a purely kitsch level, though you really have to be masochistic to get into this sort of cinematic schlock.  Surprisingly, Fox video has done a really nice job presenting this feature on DVD.  The anamorphic transfer of the Cinemascope film looks as good as it possibly could and the old-fashioned 4-channel stereo sound is nicely rendered in 4.0 Dolby Digital.  The extras include all that any fan of this movie could want, with the exception of interviews with surviving cast members and a running commentary by someone who cares -- but perhaps that would have been asking too much?  Instead you get an interactive pressbook --a very nice feature that Fox has just staring including on its recent library reissues --, a rather lame little ""featurette"" from the period, an ad and concept art gallery, and a still gallery that plays for an incredible  -- or perhaps interminable? -- nine minutes!  And, of course, the original theatrical trailer.  (This is a 2-disc release.  The second disc contains the silent, yet superior, 1925 version.  I can not attest as to that discs qualities because, you see, I merely rented disc one from Netflix.  No way I'd buy this Irwin Allen ""masterpiece.""  Sorry, but I'd rather spend my money on something else.) But wait, there's more... a vintage Fox Movietone Newsreel segment showing the NYC premiere at the Warner Theatre in July 1960.

949596,4,630497342X,"This (as indicated in the other reviews) is one of the gems of the early 1960's, long before any CGI effects for dinosaurs. In those days, the studio made its dino's by dressing up an iguana, alligator or other reptile. Then the animal was filmed close up and superimposed on the screen with the normal sized actors. It was all great fun.

The Plot:  An eccentric biologist tries to convince the scientific community of today that he has seen a lost world where dinosaurs still live. He outfits an expedition to return with proof of his claim.

The Story:  Professor Challenger returns from an expedition in the Amazon basin where he addresses the scientific community, claiming he has seen a dinosaur on the rim of a plateau. He is hooted by the assemblage and becomes indignant, daring his listeners to finance a second expedition and accompany him as observers. He finds his support and returns to the lost plateau by helicopter.

Dinosaurs are not in evidence, although there are many loud sounds in the night. Investigating a crashing (of trees) sound the group circles to find their helicopter (and only means of transport off the plateau) smashed.

Eventually the group is favored by the appearance of a grass-eating dinosaur courtesy of Frosty the poodle. The group goes through a series of adventures and winds up being captured by the unfriendly local natives. They are to be featured as the main course for the evening meal. However, as they await their fate, they meet with a blind prisoner who advises them of a way out - and a cache of diamonds.

The group, led by a native girl they befriended earlier, travel through underground cavern chased all the while by hungry natives (quick men! Our dinner is getting away!) when at last they reach the promised chamber (sealed by a door) and are able to stop the pursuers.

Greed and revenge take hold (you'll have to watch the movie for all the details) and another dinosaur awakens from a lake near at hand. The lake dino gobbles up one of the expedition and threatens the rest as they try to break a rock dam holding back a pool of lava.

The group eventually escapes and Prof. Challenger has a dino egg to offer as proof to the scientific community. But just then an eruption shakes the ground and the Prof. drops the egg. All is not lost though; inside is a living baby T-Rex.

+++++++++

By today's standards, we would all hoot at this film. But in its day it was very exciting to watch. No great effects here - in fact, some of them are downright hokey, but it's all in fun - and this is a fun movie to watch. The story itself is not bad, if sometimes clich&eacute;-ish.

Not yet available of DVD, but we can always hope. Still the VHS (full screen) is not bad and is reasonably priced. Great for a rainy afternoon's entertainment.

In fact, it's amazing they were released in the same year. Journey is so much more a classic, yet it seems more dated. Lost World is inferior, but it has a more modern touch since Irwin Allen would dominate the special effects field for the next fifteen years. George Pal, on the other hand, though he had a few good productions in the Sixties, seems more at home in the Fifties. Lost World does have its moments, even working with a lower budget, but at least they wisely spent some of their dough on getting a good cast. Claude Rains is a delightful curmudgeon, and as noted, Michael Rennie is a guy I'd take on any expedition.
