Order was through Wonder Book, and I was completely satisfied with the copy I received (an old Blockbuster copy in great condition).",1517702400,,308,4.310344827586207
8706723,5,B00UGQOGOE,"Writer Matthew Michael Carnahan has written a screenplay that looks at all aspects of war and does so by superimposing alternative philosophies  theoretical, political, news reportage, and the lives of soldiers  in a manner that allows the viewer to hear all aspects of that never ending question of Is WAR necessary?. Under Robert Redfords direction it not only works  it triumphs, in large part because the cast is so excellent. The thesis: Injuries sustained by two Army rangers behind enemy lines in Afghanistan set off a sequence of events involving a congressman, a journalist and a professor.

The three viewpoints are presented by 1) a Republican Senator (Tom Cruise) who's a presidential hopeful gives an hour-long interview to a skeptical television reporter (Meryl Streep), detailing a strategy for victory in Afghanistan 2) two special forces (Michael Pea and Derek Luke) under the guidance of a Lt Col (Peter Berg) ambushed on an Afghani ridge await rescue as Taliban forces close in; a poli-sci professor (Robert Redford) at a California college invites a promising student Andrew Garfield) to re-engage. Decisions press upon the reporter, the student, and the soldiers.

The war in question is the Afghanistan crisis post 9/11 but the tenants for all wars remain the same. Being able to follow the types of thoughts and responsibilities from the philosophy of political science, the manner in which the government is run, and the response of soldiers in battle makes an indelible impression. This is an excellent time to return to this 2007 film. Grady Harp, January 18",1516665600,,1584,5.147859922178989
