2768520,5,B000NHG7FW,"If you've never read or watched ""Charlie and Lola"", you've been missing out!  This adorable British brother and his little sister never fail to entertain while teaching valuable life lessons.  My soon-to-be four year old daughter danced around with delight when she opened the package to find her ""favorite and her best"", Charlie and Lola!  (Our ten year old and eight year old are big fans as well!)  We watch the videos, read the books and listen to the music while riding in the car!  I promise you'll become a fan too!",1182816000,,522,4.630434782608695
2768521,5,B000NHG7FW,"We love to watch the episodes on this volume.  And when I say ""we,"" I mean it.  I enjoy watching it with my girls (4 and 6) because they are constantly giggling as the animation and storyline are very entertaining for them.",1181433600,,223,4.285714285714286
2768522,5,B000NHG7FW,"I love Charlie & Lola. The drawings are fabulous and the voices are so cute. I buy the DVD's on the excuse that I am saving them for my niece, but they are really for me.  I always watch the show on the Disney Channel on the weekends if I can, even if I have the episodes on DVD.

The voice changes didn't bother me.  They seem pretty close, and still in character, at least to me. I already knew about the voice changes from watching the credits on TV--sometimes it is Daniel and Clementine and other times it is Maisie and Jethro, or is it the other way around? (love those names.)  Anyway, I always try to guess which set it is, but I can't tell.  I guess I don't have that keen an ear. I also think they really tried to keep them as close to the original as possible. As one reviewer already noted, the new ""Lola"" is the younger sister of the original.

My ""bottom line"" is --please don't let the voice changes put you off from buying this set, or any other of the volumes (5 is coming in the summer!!).  I am sure you will enjoy them just the same.",1181174400,,1053,4.08252427184466
2768523,5,B000NHG7FW,"I am a huge fan of all things Lauren Child, especially the Charlie & Lola series!

My 3-year-old son and I have the first three DVDs (in addition to many of the books). After purchasing the fourth DVD, I was a little disappointed to hear the voice changes for Charlie and Lola. It is sad not to hear the adorable voices one is used to for these lovable characters, but it is also understandable that the voices are provided by real children who grow and mature.

My son hasn't seemed to notice the voice changes. I guess, to a child, the characters, though animated, are still just as real to them.

The new voices take a little getting used to for us ""big kids"", but they are just as sweet as the original ones and the stories are still in true, quirky ""Charlie & Lola"" fashion!

(Also, the girl providing the new voice of Lola is actually the younger sister of the girl who provided the original voice for Lola!)",1181088000,6,914,4.358823529411764
