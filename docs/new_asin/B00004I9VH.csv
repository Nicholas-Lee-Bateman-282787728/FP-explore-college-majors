8545903,4,B00004I9VH,"Cathedral, one of the most charismatic Doom/Stoner bands in the world. Known for their strange innovation and mix between 70's disco and GUT pounding DOOM METAL!
I've ordered this on VHS (It's not available on DVD)thinking that this would be just a live video. To my suprise it is much more than that. This tape has 9 pro shot videos... Including Ebony Tears, Soul Sacrifice, Autumn Twilight, Ride, Midnight Mountin, Hopkins (Witchfynder General), Stained Glass Horizon, and Black Sunday (a video montage)....
Then just when you thought that the video would be over.. NO! they put 7 live songs from Tokyo, Japan. Songs include Eutopian Blaster, Stained Glass Horizon, Grim Luxuria, Midnight Mountian, Equilibriam, Hopkins (Witchfynder General), Ride.
The Video itself is decent quality (Especially for such a small record label like Earache.) The videos are all done very well (Something that you will NEVER see on MTV) The live stuff is kinda twiney.. Not the best sound quality.. Very bootlegish...
Fun to watch. Very enjoyable. It shows the bands progression from the Death/Doom style to the Disco/Stoner band they are today.
This video is a must have for any Cathedral fan. All in all I am extremly pleased that I bought this video.
