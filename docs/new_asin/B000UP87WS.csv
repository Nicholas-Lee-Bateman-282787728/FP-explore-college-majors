8214195,5,B000UP87WS,"This anime series is much more than animation that it's staggering. The best adult oriented saga can be found in this series.

Yugo, a negotiator takes us along for the ride which is his occupation. This series will keep your blood pumping as you realize that Yugo is just one step away from death. The only thing he has to rely on in most of his situations is his wits. There are no supernatural forces at work in this series, in fact, the series is so realistic, that it's easy to start believing that the series is being acted out by human beings instead of drawn anime.

The English voice acting on this series is bar none the best. It wouldnt surprise me if they used popular Hollywood Actors to act out the scenes live and on set and then, when their budget fell apart, opted to animate the movie and adding the voices later.

Lastly, if you're in the mood for a serious anime that doesnt have the idiotic comedy scenes, then this is for you. You won't regret the purchase. Like me, you'll only regret that the series is only 4 discs long. They could have taken it all the way out to 25 episodes if they wanted, but they opted against it.",1225584000,11,1144,4.311627906976744
