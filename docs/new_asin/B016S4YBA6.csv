8737219,3,B016S4YBA6,"This collection of 5 films include the two classics: ""Prom Night"" and ""Prom Night 2."" Two other features are Urban sorority films that are very cheesy and poorly filmed. The fifth film ""Vehemence"" is not currently available as a single on Amazon (US, UK, or Ca). This is the only place I know where it can be purchased. However as a scream queen film it leaves much to be desired. It is a formula love triangle film that has the word ""scream"" in it.

This can be purchased for just the two Prom Night films, although there are other multi-packs that have those two features and might include some other films worth watching. I purchased this film rather cheaply from my local Walmart for $3.74 US, about the price of 2 Redbox rentals.",1460851200,,734,4.518796992481203
