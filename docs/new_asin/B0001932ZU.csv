1979263,5,B0001932ZU,"This movie has a good plot, good actors, plenty of mystery and the beauty of one of my favorite actresses: Kate Beckinsale. Maybe it's not one of those movies with plenty of violence, chases and a lot sex (...), but it's an interesting movie. And made in the best city of Spain: Barcelona.",1086566400,7,289,4.471698113207547
1979264,4,B0001932ZU,"I must agree with the first two reviews. This is an interesting little murder mystery with the fetching Ms. Beckinsale as an art restorer caught up in a centuries old murder mystery based on a painting. Only problem is, someone in the here and now is using that same painting to do some murders of their own.
It's a light and breezy kind of amateur sleuth flick. You could do a lot worse, and if you're a fan of Kate Beckinsale, you'll enjoy this film. Except perhaps for Kate's unshaved armpits (the film is set in Europe). And yes, there are some scenes of Kate ""uncovered"".",1085097600,11,576,4.443396226415095
1979265,5,B0001932ZU,"Released in 1994, Kate Beckinsale plays the main character in this convoluted murder mystery.  She's living in Barcelona and has just graduated from College and is working at home restoring a painting that looks like it was created some time in the fifteenth century.  She gets a knock at the door and a delivery man gives her an infrared overlay that she had taken of the entire painting and she looks at it closely and discovers that underneath a layer of paint there lies an inscription which mysteriously says in Latin ""who took the knight?""  Of course, looking at the painting which is of two noblemen playing a game of chess with a young woman sitting in the background, using that interpretation of the Latin inscription it looks like the painting is a playful scene where the younger man on the left has stolen the knight from the board and the older man is crouching over the board and in a crotchety way is saying ""what happened to the knight?"" while the younger man is making eyes at the young woman in the background.  Kate's character takes the overlay to her friend, an art dealer to look at and interrupts her friend getting, ahem... serviced by the husband of the woman who is the neice of the man who owns the painting.  Kate's character shows the overlay to her friend and convinces her friend to take her to see the owner of the painting to ask him if they can have it tested to see if that inscription underneath the layer of paint is an original one.  They visit the owner and tell him about the inscription and the owner tells them that the inscription really should be translated as ""who killed the knight?"" instead of ""who took the knight?"" and from then on the entire meaning of the scene being played out in the painting takes a more ominous tone introducing the first murder victim in the story: a knight represented in the painting from five hundred years ago.
Based on the book ""The Flanders Panel"" by Arturo Perez-Reverte who wrote ""The Club Dumas"" which the movie ""The Ninth Gate"" was based  on, it is no surprise that there are a myriad of nuances that are included inside this story that make references to or are based on the intricate artwork from the high Gothic period right before the Renaissance.  The world in which the painting was supposedly made is a Machiavellian world of intrigue, doublecrossing, cutthroats and murder.  After the commissioner of the painting realizes that his friend, the young man in the painting, has been killed and because of forces outside of his control he's not able to publically accuse the murderer, he asks the painter to alter the painting in such a way that it depicts who the murderer is, but in a secret code.  The code of course is played out in miniature in the chess game the two men are playing and in it each piece represents different players in the plot and eventually by hiring a young man to play the game itself backwards Kate's character is able to figure out who actually did in the end kill the knight in the past.  Pretty soon, pieces from a very fancy chess set start to pop up outside of her door and she soon finds herself in the middle of her own little murder mystery as people in her own life start to drop like flies mirroring both the pieces that pop up in front of her door and the pieces that are taken if the chess game in the painting were played out to its logical conclusion.  The chess game itself is a microcosm of the intrigue that occurred back in the fifteenth century and of the intrigue that is going on in the present.  By going backwards, the young man Kate's character hires is able to figure out what happened in the past and by going forwards with the game itself from where the painter left it off in the fifteenth century the young man is also able to predict who the likely candidates for murder are going to be in the near future.  The plot itself mirrors the chess game to a tee to the amusement of the audience to the point where one ends up thinking about which characters in the movie are represented by which pieces in the game and also how would the drama of the chess game where one piece can viciously take hold of or slaughter another piece be played out in real life.
In my opinion, this is much better than the movies you'd see Kate Beckinsale play characters in today.  From her choice of movie roles today compared to back when this movie was made one sort of has to wonder where her career priorities have turned to lie.  If you disliked the blander, more commercialized and more static roles that she's played from more recently then you might not like this movie that much; but if enjoy a good thriller with a cleverly written thoroughly amusing plot then this is probably the movie for you!",1081209600,19,4729,4.468677494199536
1979266,3,B0001932ZU,"Just watched this movie on DVD. The main attraction of this movie is obviously the beautiful Kate Beckinsale. If you don't like Kate Beckinsale (hard to imagine) then this movie will be a drag. Otherwise, this movie is a decent enough movie with a plot and cast that will keep you interested. I am giving it three stars since I like both Kate Beckinsale and Art Malik.",1080950400,2,368,4.507462686567164
1979267,3,B0001932ZU,"So far as I can tell, this little-known British/Spanish production had never been shown or otherwise made available in the United States prior to the release of this DVD.  I first saw it on an imported videotape with Portugese subtitles.  More than likely, it is being released in the U.S. now to capitalize on Kate Beckinsale's increasingly high profile.  Its most noteworthy feature is the appearance of its comely star nude in no less than three scenes, her only such exposure to date.
Viewers whose main interest is seeing Ms. Beckinsale ""uncovered"" will not be disappointed.  However, the movie itself is not so bad either.  Although a little rough by Hollywood standards, it offers a decent murder mystery with an interesting twist.  Beckinsale plays Julia, a rising star in the world of art restoration.  An aristocratic family commissions her to work on a Renaissance painting that has been in their possession for over 500 years.  It depicts two men playing chess while a woman watches in the background.  Julia quickly discovers that the painting has been altered and contains clues to the murder of one of the chess players.  As soon as Julia grows curious about this 500 year-old crime, someone begins killing people close to her.  She can only conclude that solving the ancient mystery will provide the key to her present-day horrors.
While Julia continues to coax hidden details from the painting, she enlists the aid of a truly unique character.  She hires Domenec (Paudge Behan), a sort of ""chess bum,"" to work out the details of the game in the painting -- the moves that brought the pieces to where they are and the likely outcome of the game. The bohemian Domenick makes his living hustling high-stakes chess games (huh?).  His surfer-with-a-brain appearance and lifestyle provide both a foil and an eventual romantic allure for the uptight Julia.  From there, it becomes a race between this unlikely duo and the killer.  They must solve the mystery before more people, including Julia herself, are murdered.",1077494400,68,2027,4.973293768545994

1979355,4,B0001932ZU,"So, this film is based on the novel ""The Flanders Panel"" and is a twisty little tale that comes from a 500 year old murder mystery  hidden in a painting that turns out to be just as important in the modern world in some ways as it was when it happened. A simple art history puzzle turns into a complex crime story as people reveal secrets and desires in a twisty little game of chess and murder.

My my it's been a long time since I saw a movie this poorly put together. The music alone rates zero & the directing, writing & acting is scant above that. It does have Sinead Cusack & I have enjoyed her in a number of things so it was nice to stumble upon her again.

I can't remember ever losing interest in a set of characters involved in a mystery as quickly as I did this one. By the time Kate puts her pert breasts on screen with their perfectly upturned nipples I had already been bludgeoned by the directing to the point I didn't care what happened next. Apparently no one else cared either. You're a pretty woman Kate but it wasn't worth this to see you nude. I give only .5 stars.

Her current project is a Flemish painting of a Medievil chess game.  She uncovers a hidden inscription, placing in question the sale of the painting and seemingly triggering a series of mysterious deaths.

The plot is loaded with potential suspects, from a greedy art agent to a two-timing boyfriend to a gay art dealer and even a gypsy chess player.  The solution is to be found in the recreation of the chess game in the painting, which seems to provide clues to the victims.

The plot will eventually become a little obvious to sharp-eyed viewers, but the movie is worth watching for the way it revels in the setting and its own sense of melodrama.  A sharp cast of British characters actors helps carry the movie; if a certain amount of scenery chewing goes on, it is all in good fun.

1979412,3,B0001932ZU,"I stumbled across this movie on a DVD rental site and found it to be surprisingly entertaining. For those of you who are familiar with Arturo Perez Reverte's works, this movie is based on his novel titled 'The Flanders Panel' which in itself is a good thriller, though you do have to be familiar with the game of chess as that's crucial to the plot.

This movie contains an early, rather tomboyish Kate Beckinsale, though still very much spirited. She plays an art restorer who finds there's a secret message in a piece of art that she's restoring, a panel that has been in a particular family of noble lineage for 500 years. She enlists the help of her ex-professor/ex-boyfriend Alvaro, played by Art Malik, who later turns up dead, presumably of natural causes. Well, turns out that Alvaro is the first in a series of deaths and Kate's character tries to decipher what's going on, with the help of a street chess player [based on the assumption that the deaths are related to the game of chess depicted in the panel].

Anyway, the story though based on an interesting premise, soon turns out to be contrived, yet that doesn't detract from one's enjoyment of this movie. There are quite a few sexy scenes here, and quite a bit of nudity as well - Kate flashes bits of herself, and sometimes almost all of herself unabashedly, and this is early kate, very young and tomboyish, with a cropped hairstyle, yet displaying the peaches and cream beauty that still defines her today.

The murderer in the story will be quite apparent to most viewers before the ending, yet I would still recommend it for its interesting premise and sexy bits. It might also interest some viewers that another of Arturo reverte's works, titled The Club Dumas was also made into a movie, The Ninth Gate [with Johnny Depp] which is a sort of literary/supernatural thriller.",1201046400,5,1846,4.691358024691358

1979415,3,B0001932ZU,"Medieval paintings and a chess game seem like unlikely murder components, but they set off the whole plot of art puzzle/murder mystery ""Uncovered."" The adaptation of Arturo Perez/Reverte's novel is picturesque and has some good acting, but suffers from a total lack of suspense when it comes to whodunnit.

Art student Julia (Kate Beckinsale) is delighted when an X-ray of a old painting shows a Latin inscription: ""Who killed the knight?"" The trio in the painting includes a medieval duke, his young wife, and a French knight who was pretty obviously having an affair with the wife. With the help of her cheating ex-boyfriend and mysterious chess prodigy Domenec (Paudge Behan), Julia unravels the question of who killed the knight -- and why the picture was altered after it was finished.

But that isn't the end -- Julia's ex-boyfriend turns up dead in the shower, and the kindly old owner of the painting dies within days. And with each death, a corresponding ivory chess piece is left on Julia's doorstep. As brutal heirs and conniving art dealers scrabble for the painting, Julia tries to unravel who is behind the killings -- before black queen takes white queen...

""Uncovered"" is more interesting as a clever art puzzle than a murder mystery, set in Barcelona's sunny colourful streets and ancient castles. It is genuinely fascinating to see the hidden meanings of the chess game and its hidden meanings, as well as the politics of Burgundy versus France. This part is intriguing, intelligent, and genuinely has an element of classical mystery.

Unfortunately, it sags when it turns into a murder mystery (with a bit of nudity thrown in), loosely tied into the medieval murder with the use of chess pieces. The murderer's identity is glaringly obvious even before he's killed anyone, and the campy, shrieky finale suffers because you already know who he is. Even the callous heirs to weren't enough to throw off the scent.

This was only Kate Beckinsale's second major role, so perhaps she can be forgiven her mediocre performance. She's middling most of the time, and occasionally lapses into hysterical crying.  John Wood is a scene-stealer as the devoted gay guardian Cesar, backed by Sinad Cusack as a catty aging party-girl and Michael Gough as an ailing aristocrat. No, I don't know by British actors are playing a slew of Spaniards, but they do a good job.

""Uncovered"" is an intriguing art mystery, but it trips over itself in the second half when it becomes a mysteryless mystery. If it weren't for that, it would be simply brilliant.",1180915200,5,2552,4.934731934731935

She discovers the mystery centers on the game of chess being played in the painting and enlists the help of a young chess genius to deconstruct the game and predict upcoming moves.

""Uncovered"" is a trite mystery. It's enjoyable to watch to an extent, but it has a very annoying soundtrack and the acting isn't particularly good, even Beckinsale in an obviously early role for her (and her haircut is awful). There is no real suspense to anything that happens.

1979441,1,B0001932ZU,"Artisan - Lions Gate typically puts out some pretty good independent films (or at the least, interesting ones).  ""Haunted"" (also staring Kate Beckinsale) and Adian Quin is a very well told story with a gripping plot.  ""Angels & Insects"" is another worth while film by this company.  However, ""Uncovered"" is roughly the worst film I've ever seen.  A complete waste of 2 hours, period.  In retrospect, there is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever.  The acting is dreadful on every account (even Beckinsale, whom I like most of the time.)  The characters are totally undeveloped and unlikable; Beckinsale's G.I. Joe Haircut sometimes made it difficult to distinguish her form the men.  Although I think the worst part about this film was the soundtrack, absolutely horrifying!  (And I DON'T mean scary).  It was a really bad jazz theme, like Kenny G converted to elevator music.  It was like going to the drive-through at McDonalds and getting someone else's order.  There must have been a mix up at the editing room, this music could not have possibly been scored for a supposed mystery.  The music set the scene for a cheesy B-level romantic comedy (seriously).  It did not ad to the mystery feeling at all.  About a third of the way through, a 12-year-old could predict the outcome, even with the high-school-play level acting.  One may think, ""no, it can't be that, there must be a twist!""  There isn't.  More holes in the plot than a William Castle film (without all of the fun) somewhat resembling a slice of Swiss Cheese.",1170547200,6,1534,4.857142857142857
1979442,5,B0001932ZU,Uncovered is a fun film with some interesting intrique and a solid plot.  Kate Beckinsale is excellent as Julia the woman who has to restore an old painting and finds more than she bargained for.  It isn't a deep film but it has a unique atmosphere and of course the divine Kate.  Definitely entertaining.  It's got something different about it.,1170374400,3,345,4.7

1979444,3,B0001932ZU,"As noted by many other reviewers, the cinematography as well as the Barcelona location is lush and extremely eye-pleasing.  To anyone who has read the book, the film is disappointing.  Although keeping with the fundamental plot, several elements have changed enough to lose the creepy forbidding air that novel established so well.  In particular, the time spent in the film on the heroine's eating habits and her procilivity to sneeze right before a romantic clutch seem downright silly, even if the former nods and jokes towards Beckinsale's reputed real life early battle with anorexia.

If you've been to Barcelona, it is a real tresure to see the city and particularly its Gaudi treasures laid out so skillfully.  This film plays visual homage brilliantly to one of the world's great cities.

Otherwise, read the book and skip the movie.  The art history is very superficial and in some cases just plain dumb.  I seriously doubt any real art restorer blows sigarette smoke on a painting while it is being repaired!",1160611200,8,1019,4.988165680473373
1979445,2,B0001932ZU,"Slight, insubstantial bit of fluff about a young art restorer (Kate Beckinsale), a begrimed Flemish painting she's commissioned to clean up, and an ancient murder mystery chronicled in the painting and... happening again!!!

 You see, the painting depicts a doge playing a game of chess with a knight while the doge's wife sits at a window and looks on.  They're all casting meaningfully sidelong glances at each other.  Beneath the painting is a text, in Latin, asking `who killed the knight?'  As soon as Kate starts scraping off the old lacquer and paint that cover the inscription, folks around her start falling like ten pins.  And, to ratchet up the mystery some, chess pieces are left at her doorstep after every murder.

 Naturally, the police are ruling all the murders death by natural causes, Kate enlists a Spanish gypsy chess genius, beds are hopped with impunity, while I'm wondering why the heck I rented this one in the first place.  I'd never heard of Kate Beckinsale, and this one didn't convert me.  I don't think it had anything to do with her.  She has a certain gamin charm, and the couple of in-the-buff scenes convinced me her charms didn't stop with her smile.  The story is so lumbering and hokey, though, a bad soap opera unnaturally conjoined to a bad mystery, that I found it hard to rouse interest between the au natural bits.  Didn't help much that I figured it out before the first chess piece fell, either.

 Recommended only for Beckinsale fans, or at least those who - unlike me - know who she is and are interested in seeing her in an early movie.",1160265600,6,1583,4.664259927797834

1979448,3,B0001932ZU,"""Uncovered"" is a lot like its lead actress, Kate Beckinsdale, sort of light and easy on the eyes. The story is loosely based on Arturo Perez-Reverte's book ""The Flanders Panel"" and centers around a 16th century Dutch painting, ""The Chess Game,"" that Beckinsdale's character is restoring so it can be sold at auction. When she uncovers a secret inscription, ""Who killed the knight?"" hidden under a layer of paint, she starts researching the painting to find out what it all means. But as she works, she becomes more than a little distracted by the growing pile of corpses of people associated with the painting, and a young gypsy chess expert enlisted to help with part of the puzzel.

It all goes down relatively quickly and easily, sort of like the whipped cream on the pastry Beckinsdale and the gypsy chess expert share during a sloppy kiss on the street after their first night together, and about as dangerous. Barcelona, the city where the film is set, also comes off really well -- picturesque old streets, and some architectural treasure by Gaudi around every corner. The oddest thing though is that, to judge by the film, all the inhabitants of Barcelona are actually English -- one hears almost no Spanish or Catalan in the entire film. Fans of Perez-Reverte, looking for a decent adaptation of one of his fine books, are going to be disappointed, though perhaps less so than with the disasterous ""Ninth Gate"" that was made from the novel ""The Dumas Club.""",1142985600,16,1466,4.794466403162056
1979449,4,B0001932ZU,"Three and a half Stars, so I upgraded to Four Stars! ""Uncovered"" is murder mystery movie that is quite unusual. Unusual in that it covers a centuries old murder, all emanating from a silent source of clues, and the twists and turns keep coming from beginning to end. Beckingsale, an art restorer, finds herself in the unwitting and unwilling role of detective as well, presumably to drive up the cost of a painting that Beckinsale is restoring. I love the technique she uses to fend off unwanted male attention: a real effective technique! And watch for when she doesn't use it! LOL.

While the cast gives very good performances, this is the young Kate Beckinsale's movie to win or lose because she is in virtually every scene of substance: she is a FABULOUS actress! Sporting a fetchingly short boyish haircut, soulful eyes, and pouty lips that Angelina Jolie would love to have, she is the prototypical marvel of a young, pretty, totally compelling British actress. Oh, and there are some fascinating views of Barcelona. The story line gets somewhat muddled near the end, but who cares, watching the rangy Beckinsale eating up this movie is quite mesmerizing in and of itself. There is some tasteful moderate partial nudity and much profanity, but it's 'closed-captioned' so TV Guardian can filter the language. Great cinematography and excellent music. Well worth a look!!

1979486,3,B0001932ZU,"The reason I gave this DVD 3 stars instead of 2 is because of Kate Beckinsale and Barcelona. She is what keeps this weakly written murder mystery from turning into the kind of movie where the audience gets up to leave halfway thru after they've figured out ""the butler did it"" before the actors have. She's totally unbelieveable in the role of an art restorer, blowing cigarette smoke and sneezing all over a supposedly priceless work of art. Instead, Beckinsale comes across as a 19-yr-old art student fiddling around with a 500-yr-old treasure...albeit she is a very attractive one, with or without her clothes on. I also found it interesting that she has a different outfit on in just about every scene, except for the ones where she's wearing virtually nothing. Anyway, the shots of Kate and the city of Barcelona are what kept my interest. A word of advice, keep the sound off while watching this movie because the music is horrible.",1135209600,21,938,4.7607361963190185

It is quite an old film (1992) but it looks older, it has an 80s feel to it, the colors aren't sharp, as many European films were until recently. The copy is not the best either and the DVD comes with no extra features. The story is good and Kate Beckinsale offers a good early performance. I cannot help but compare it to the cinematic adaptation of another Perez-Reverte novel, The Ninth Gate, and there is where this one falls short. Still it's entertaining and surprising as a good mystery should be, and if you are a Kate Beckinsale fan, you will be glad that she is in almost every scene.",1128643200,6,643,4.411764705882353

Kate Beckinsale is quite good, but most of the casting choices are wretched, and this film looks like it was directed by a college student on a modest budget. The sleazy ending has little to do with the subtle, surprise ending in the novel. Perez-Reverte must have cringed when he saw what was done to his story.",1117843200,10,475,4.734939759036145

It's also a joy to see a movie which recognizes the existence of the game of chess.

One sour note is the first few minutes of the sound track which is an unbelievably wretched piece of music. Feel free to turn the sound off until there is dialogue. If you choose not to, don't say I didn't warn you.",1114819200,35,720,4.538461538461538
1979490,4,B0001932ZU,"Considering that this film is based on the novel by popular contemporary Spanish author Arturo Perez-Reverte entitled ""La Tabla de Flandes"" (""The Flemish Panel""), it defies reason that this DVD would appear without a Spanish language sound track (the more so because the action takes place entirely in Spain, and at least in the novel all the main characters are Spanish).  Of the three films made from novels by this author, only one -- ""El Maestro de Esgrima"" (""The Fencing Master""), starring the gifted Spanish actress Asumpta Serna, is in Spanish, and it is by far the best of the three.  The third Perez-Reverte novel to make it to the screen, ""El Club Dumas"", appeared as ""The Ninth Gate"" with Johnny Depp -- again, unfortunately, it also lacks a Spanish language sound track.  All three novels are very good indeed, and the films are generally good as well.  What is incomprehensible is why the decision was made to separate two of these movies from their natural audience -- the Spanish, and Spanish-speaking populations of other countries, who avidly read Arturo Perez-Reverte novels -- by failing to include a sound track in the Spanish language.  Bad artistic decision, and bad marketing decision, but nonetheless an intriguing and worthwhile film.  If you find the general idea of the film intriguing -- investigating the mysteries of art restoration, a possible murder centuries ago, and clues provided in a chess game -- you might want to go beyond a look at the film and read the book (in Spanish, if possible)!!!!",1105228800,13,1529,4.929961089494164

However, please do not let that stop you from buying or renting it.  This is a wonderful movie to watch.  It just goes to show that a movie doesn't have to be a blockbuster at the box office to be good.

This is one of Kate Beckinsale's earlier films.  It was a treat to watch her youthful charm and charisma at this stage in her career.  She was simply adorable as Julia, a young lady who makes her living restoring works of art.  And that short haircut simply looked sexy on her.  Anyway, I have always considered her to be a good actress.  And this is certainly a film to own for those who are fans of Kate Beckinsale.  If you would like to see Kate's earlier films, I highly recommend both Haunted and Much Ado About Nothing.

The plot centers around a murder mystery that originates from a (previously hidden) inscription on a painting that is hundreds of years old.  There is one scene that stands out above all others, where Kate is gazing at the painting.  NOT ONLY does she look fantastic topless, but there is also a nice bit of symbolism in how the removal of her clothes = the uncovering of the inscription & offers a ""revealation"" of sorts.

This deciphering of a mystery that is the center of the film, and that scene is the ""heart"" of the movie.  While some may feel it was an excuse for gratuitous nudity, I really think it had some symbolic relevance.  But, that's just me.

When you boil it down, this film will attract people who are fans of one or more of the following three things:  Kate Beckinsale, chess and murder mysteries.  People who are into art & art history might perchance be attracted to this film as well.

  There is much whimsy in this story. The characters almost seem like cartoons at first, but you soon find that this is their charm. The mystery is interesting and keeps you guessing. I thought I had the ending figured out, but I was happily wrong.

  The other major component of the storyline is the majesty of Barcelona. Barcelona's beauty is gallant and yet subtle. The wonderful architecture will wow you, the simple but stylish city streets and the simple but romantic people give this film a rich texture that will no doubt make you want to make Spain your next vacation spot.

  If this same film had been set in New York, it would have fallen dull. This could easily have fallen in to clique'. But instead it had a different adventure to give. The music is fun and transforms some of the more serious moments in to a blended feel of satisfaction. 'What you're doing is serious, but don't forget you're having fun.' Is the feeling I got from the score.

I really enjoyed this film. It is not a deep mystery nor a passionate love affair and the dialog isn't Shakespeare, but that being said, you can sit and relax with this story. Most of the people are likable and you'll feel like you're among friends. Give it a try. It's one of those forgotten art gems that we're privileged to now see many years later on DVD.

1979495,4,B0001932ZU,"UNCOVERED is a ten year old film, popular in its co-producing countries of the UK and Spain, and is finally available here for those who want to see 'early Kate Bekinsale'.  The story weaves around an art restorer (Bekinsale) who finds bizarre clues in the underpainting of an old Flemish master painting that is being prepared for sale by a once rich/now destitute family. The art restorer has been raised by a fey gentleman who turns out to be part the current family requesting the restoration.  As she carefully uncovers the surface of the painting and has it xrayed, she finds clues to a mystery of a murder, a murder that slowly is recreated around her.  This is a good little mystery whose solution is tightly pigmented in a rather beautiful painting and a game of chess, which is the centerpiece of the painting.  The cast, including Kate Bekinsale, is good if a bit campy: John Wood, Sinead Cusack, Paudge Behan, Art Malik, James Villiers, Michael Gough.  But the real star of the film is the beauty of Barcelona, Spain  - the setting for the story.  Gaudi is everywhere!  The lighting is gorgeous and the cinematography excellent.  There are things with which one can quibble, not the least the techniques used by the art restoration advisors, but the one major fault with this film is the sound track.  The music is abominable and the ambient sound is so loud that it sounds like a home movie instead of a professional production: you have to strain to hear the dialogue over the street sounds outside the rooms.
