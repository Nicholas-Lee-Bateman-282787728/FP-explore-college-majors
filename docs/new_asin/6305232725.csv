(He's of mixed Japanese and American descent, but he plays a Native American martial artist here.) Do not see this for the plot, the acting, the setting, or if you like movies with characters you actually care about. Do see it if you want to watch a female martial artist beat the snot out of a bunch of rednecks. There is no other point to this movie.",1030233600,2,462,4.32183908045977

997543,5,6305232725,"""China O'Brien"" demonstrates the chemistry between martial artists Richard Norton and Cynthia Rothrock in an early co-starring effort that would ultimately make them a team in demand
for fight movie fans.  This agreeable adventure casts Rothrock
in the lead, as she campaigns for town sheriff, with Norton as
her most loyal ally.  It's a winning movie that laid the founda-
tion for later films for the pair such as ""Rage and Honor"" and
""Lady Dragon.""  It's a pleasure to return to a movie that, among
others, helped to promote the careers of two terrific stars!",1005523200,5,562,4.894736842105263

Dad gets killed and she runs for sheriif.  Then it is all mindless fighting. The fight scenes are awful. China beats fat trailer trash who sail backwards every time she flicks out a kick.
This is a so bad it is good kind of a movie.  You just laugh through it.  You know: Hey why is that guy speaking in an Australian accent all of a sudden?  Sure a three hundred pound guy is going to sail 10 feet from Cynthia's kick.",993427200,,585,4.243243243243243

7886126,4,6305232725,"""China O'Brien"" belongs to an era of action movies that never saw the inside of a movie theater, but not for a lack of effort. As the first real American vehicle of former Hong Kong action queen Cynthia Rothrock, ""China O'Brien"" appeals to the lovers of blondes, kung fu, and macho feminism expressed by having the unassuming leading lady beat the snot out of every redneck and gangbanger she comes across. On one level, it's a cheesy low-budget fight flick that's going to draw boos from folks who worship&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>, but on another level (this is the one I'm on, by the way), it's among the better flicks directed by Robert Clouse during his dismal post-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/6304981635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>&nbsp;career and one of the best all-around films starring Cynthia after she waved goodbye to Asia.

The story: after shooting a man in the alleyways of a big city, China O'Brien (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) pledges to give up her career as a policewoman and returns to her rural hometown to spend time with her father, the sheriff...only to find her former home struggling against the clutches of well-funded organized crime. When her father is murdered for his interference in the circuit's schemes, China defies the criminals by running for his vacated position to clean up the town - something she can only hope to achieve with the aid of her old crush (Richard Norton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/078062260X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Nice Guy</a>), a mysterious biker (Keith Cooke,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>), and the support of the townspeople.

Let me start by pointing out that this ensemble is probably among one of the most unique and exciting martial arts trios ever gathered for a film. Rothrock, of course, is the Hong Kong veteran with the tutelage of the world's top cine-fu stars under her belt, but she's matched by the super-talented Australian Norton, who's fought just about every big-name star in martial arts, and the enigmatic Keith Cooke, an underrated fighter both on and off the screen who spent his most famous roles wearing masks. These three are given carte blanche to show off, with some very neat and fast-paced hand-to-hand battles. Granted, of the five fights in the film, at least two are kind of absurd, with nonstop attempts to prove China superior to her masculine foes resulting in some choreography that very obviously isn't applicable in real life, and at least one occasion where Richard Norton's lightning-quick blows visibly fail to connect with their target. On the whole, though, the originality and effort put into the fight choreography shine through, and provide definite thrills to viewers not jaded by wire-fu.

As a dramatic piece, however, the film is in a bit of trouble. The acting's fine as far as DTV films go (considering that most of the supporting cast had never before been in a movie), but the heaping melodrama, feel-good hamminess, and vast coincidental nature of the storyline will put ""China"" at odds with snooty critics. As basically a heavy-handed take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walking-Tall/dp/B000VDDDWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walking Tall</a>, the film offers much cause for righteous indignation but next to no character development or plot twists beyond the expected. The production values are obviously limited by budget, but director Clouse manages his resources well, particularly in making the town and its inhabitants seem believable. More surprisingly, he manages to make a half-statement regarding the difference between what a woman *can* be and what society *wants* her to be without any speeches or flag-waving: Rothrock lets her actions speak louder than words, and Clouse channels these to the point that the movie could double as recruiting drive to encourage women to study self-defense.

If you're new to the exploits of Cynthia, check out her Hong Kong pictures first, but come back to this one as the second course. Richard Norton fans looking to see him not playing a villain for once should also give this a buy. Those wanting to see some awesome three-way kicks, pick it up for Keith Cooke's martial performance. Action fans in general should assess their priorities, and those favoring pure heart and talent over big names and budgets ought to give this a watch, too, and not wait long about it!",1254096000,4,4899,5.925035360678925
7886127,2,6305232725,"O.K. I'm sure you already know that this is a low budget action film, Cynthia Rothrock stars as the leed character ""China O'Brien"" who's father is the local sheriff, the sheriff is murdered by the bad guys who attempt to take over the local turf, so in retaliation Cynthia runs for sheriff to avenge her fathers untimely death.  now is when the action begins, there are outstanding martial arts performances by ""Keith Cooke"" as ""Dakota""  and Richard Norton also did a pretty good job of kicking [...] with the local Utah talent where this was fillmed.",1210464000,,551,4.729166666666667
7886128,3,6305232725,"This movie is particularly good for martial artists, for everybody else you may want to pass on this one.  The fight scenes are done in the ""last dinosaur"" style, by that I mean that the action is very close (or closer) to how a real martial art fight would be and NOT like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon like most modern martial art movies are.  Not to fear though, the action is not dull in any sense, the fight scenes are similar to 'The Best of the Best'.

The story goes like this, a female cop/martial artist quits the force after an incident in a back alley. She goes back home and her father/ex-sheriff is murdered so she decides to run for sheriff and clean up the town.  Then she and her high kicking boyfriend proceed to whip everybody's you know what that gets in their way.  Cheesy...maybe but the action is good.  Also, there is another character in the movie named ""Dakota"" who is awesome; to me he almost stills the show from Cynthia.

There is even a sequel to this, which is even better (action wise), called China O'Brien 2.",1118361600,6,1042,4.424083769633508
