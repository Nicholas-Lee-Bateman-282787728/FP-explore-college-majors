8702133,3,B00TKM7HT6,"I'd be hard-pressed to say this is a good movie.  As a slasher, it's not gory, there's not really any nudity, either.  It's more about the '80's shot on video experience.  It does have a few slimy grimy creepy moments spread out.  Thankfully the movie's about an hour, so that helps.

The extras are the saving grace here.  The commentary is fun and informative, and it explains Spine's limitations, and a funny story about how an actor had to be replaced during the shoot, so two actors play the same character in the movie (which is very noticeable).

Still happy to own this DVD.  A miracle it got re-released.  Not a stellar movie, but it's here, and if you're a fan of '80's SOV, consider it a must.",1432166400,5,704,4.4375
