7697858,3,B01D64VSYI,"153 minutes of Computer Generated Imaging! How lucky can we be? When The Dark Knight battles The Man of Steel, they make mincemeat of either Metropolis or Gotham City, I wasn't sure which. Much of the dialogue is lost in the overwhelming noise of their many many battles, both individually and with each other. At least the DVD will have closed captions.

Batman sees that Superman isn't concerned enough about collateral damage (civilians hurt or killed), so he decides to take action.  Director Zack Snyder (""Man of Steel"") working from a script by a committee of six (!), shows us what happens when a superhero is threatened with interference.

Here is part of the huge cast:
  * Henry Cavill (""The Man from Uncle"") Clark Kent/Superman does NOT agree that he needs oversight. In fact, he takes strong exception to the idea! But he does admit that he goes a bit too far when Lois Lane is in jeopardy.
  * Ben Affleck (""Gone Girl"") Bruce Wayne/Batman is sure he's doing the right thing. Superman's reluctance to be supervised only proves his point! This Dark Knight is very dark indeed. (I wish they didn't garble his voice each time he dons his disguise.)
  * Amy Adams (""American Hustle"") Lois Lane aware of Clark Kent's secret identity, but can't tell anyone. In the meantime, she's a dauntless journalist who endangers herself and as a result, Superman's reputation.
  * Diane Lane (""Trumbo"") Clark's Kansas mother Martha Kent tells her son that people hate what they don't understand.
  * Laurence Fishburne (""Black-ish"") Newspaper editor Perry White has an ace reporter he's proud of (Lane) and one that seems to need to be propped up occasionally (Kent). His biggest problem is the newspaper's falling subscription base.
  * Jeremy Irons (""Margin Call"") Bruce Wayne needs the faithful (and efficient!) Alfred, who is as adept with electronics as with all other aspects of Wayne's life.
  * Jesse Eisenberg (""The Social Network"") Lex Luthor is an essential part of the story: you can't have heroes without villains! It looks to me like Eisenberg wants to OWN this jerky twitchy unpredictable version!
  * Holly Hunter (""Manglehorn"") Senator Finch says she can wrestle a pig, among other things; furthermore she is convinced that congressional oversight is exactly what is needed to control Superman.
  * Gal Gadot (""Furious 7"") Diana Prince/Wonder Woman is also in the mix, although she tries to keep a low profile.

This chapter will launch a whole new franchise for the Justice League but I will admit to CGI overload. When a mortal is fighting a superman, he has to throw in everything but the kitchen sink. Well... actually.... hmmm...

This is rated PG-13, so you can expect bloody violence, no nudity, profanity or sweaty bodies. However, expect lots of vehicular mayhem, gruesome monsters, skyscrapers collapsing, gunfights and blowie uppie stuff. I hit sensory overload very near the beginning, so be warned... BTW, it also includes the traumatic event in Wayne's childhood that launched his crime-fighting career.",1458777600,3,3029,5.026052104208417
7697859,5,B01D64VSYI,"But I loved it, never saw the theatrical cut but I can say that this versions characters have very clear arcs that make sense and the stories are all neatly tied up, plus the action is amazing and in the final hour, the impossible occurs and Henry Cavill finally starts to feel like Superman, worth giving a second look or a first one if you missed it in theaters",1536537600,,363,4.27536231884058

7697872,5,B01D64VSYI,"First off let me say this is a really fun, action filled, superhero movie with Ben Affleck as a surprisingly awesome Batman/Bruce Wayne. I think Affleck makes the 3rd best Batman of the film world behind #1 Michael Keaton who of course IS BATMAN, and #2 Christian Bale in The Dark Knight Trilogy. This movie has a tough challenge of having to be both a Batman movie and a Superman movie. As a Batman movie, no it is not as good as Nolan's Dark Knight films or Tim Burton's classic original but it is a very good Batman movie. It's better than Batman Forever and of course WAY better than Batman and Robin, and its fun. As a Superman movie it is better than Superman 3 &4 and WAY better than Superman Returns. It is a very fun Superman movie as was Man Of Steel. It's not a perfect movie by any means but the filmmakers put these two iconic comic book characters together on screen in a awesome way. Sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the ride.",1534896000,,945,4.284916201117318
7697873,1,B01D64VSYI,"The reason why this film should get a one star for receiving most nihilistic film of all time is: to due justice to Batman Vs Superman: A Nihilistic Journey which fortunately has Gal Gadot to save the day because everyone else apparently doesn't know what in the world they're doing.

Superman was a tour de force and didn't get justice for his role as the dawn of hope in this film. Hollywood: We're tired of sacrifices and mass manipulation. Gal Gadot is, as usual, Gal Gadot. Nothing but my own wife could be better. Ben Assflak was... as usual, Ben Assflak. The only way the film could have been more depressing was if Ben Assflak didn't have his depression meds on hand.

I write reviews of films rarely. The film had so much potential, yet Snack Sider obviously needs to smother us with depression and nihilism. The only happy person in the film was ""Lex Luther"" who was borrowing the success of his father. Millennials don't have money to spend $50 for a movie for two at the cinema if their parents aren't rich. Now, Lex makes sense. No value given, yet expectations multiplied by 10000000.

I would like to say this was the worst film I've ever seen, but... I love Gal Gadot and Henry Cavil is fantastic. Throw Ben Assflak under a bus already and let a serious film be made. Not everyone who watches these are Americans.",1534809600,,1329,4.529166666666667

7697886,2,B01D64VSYI,This muddled mess of a film mixes together scenes with little in the way of rhyme or reason. The overall story-line and specific character portrayals are both ludicrous. There's not much that one can say about this that's not already been said. It's a movie with only a handful of interesting moments that's only worth seeing to keep one updated on what's happened in the fictional universe of the DC characters. That's it. There's very little in terms of enjoyment that one can get from these kinds of depressive films.,1533600000,,520,4.788888888888889

7697896,1,B01D64VSYI,"Why did you make this movie? As a launch pad to Wonder Woman?
There is no dawn of justice except death of logic, context and screenplay.
The cause is banal and flimsiest ever. This is a movie where both Batman and Superman look like guest actors who fight for no compelling reason. One moment Batman was all rage stomping on kryptoned Super Man, and the next moment he becomes a kindred spirit just because he heard the name ""Martha"". That is simply a junk story line. Lex Luthor is a waste. Lois Lane is boring. Every body will just bore you because the story is ultra-boring.",1532736000,,577,4.452830188679245

7697907,4,B01D64VSYI,"The film gets a bad reputation because the Marvel Cinematic Universe launched 5 years before the DC Extended Universe. The weak point of the movie is Lex Luthor, and the film inevitably was going to be compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy due to the inclusion of Batman. However, these criticisms are unfair. The movie is dark, as well it should be. It doesn't have (and doesn't need) lame Marvel throw-away jokes. Wonder Woman is amazing, as is Batman. The Ultimate Edition fills in lots of details and should have been theatrically released.",1531958400,,542,4.838709677419355

Take it from someone who walked out of the theater giving this a 6/10 and being pissed off.  Snyder, Goyer, and Terrio made a damn good film.  More Clark Kent scenes and tie ins to the plot that answer questions the viewers needed upon first viewing!  Give the film another chance or if you haven't seen the film make sure it's this version.

Upon finally viewing it, I am forced to admit that while it's grim, humorless, and terribly flawed, it's not without value. It sets up Justice League well, and serves to introduce Wonder Woman and give us glimpses of better things to come. Eventually. I'm not fond of the gibbering Lex Luthor, and I'm still on the fence about Affleck as Batman.

7697976,2,B01D64VSYI,"First, besides being an awful movie, my chief criticism is that despite being a supposedly high definition (HD) movie, the transfer is barely above standard definition (SD)! If you bought it in Blu-Ray, you most likely got cheated. (I bought the Amazon movie, so I haven't actually seen the Blu-Ray, but the Amazon movie is horrible. I'd like to hear from a Blu-Ray viewer to see if it's a poor on BR as it is on Amazon.)

As for the movie itself, there are tons of non-sequiturs throughout. Why didn't Superman use his x-ray vision to see Batman's identity? Why didn't he follow Batman from above to learn about his secret Bat-cave? And why, at the Capitol, did Superman leave contrails when he flew away? The enmity between Superman and Batman is strained at best and at the point of conflict in the film, there was no reason for Batman not to have heard Superman out. The ensuing fight was contrived because each thought the other was a vigilante. (We also see the secondary bad guy, Anatoli Knyazev, as the same villainous hired gun in Captain America. Hail, Hydra!)

The movie was a mess. Batman can't move in all the armor he's wearing. Why does he need it and Captain America doesn't? And why are Marvel movies so consistently better than D.C.'s?

I would perhaps like the movie better if it were in high definition. Why the producers put out such an el-sucko video is beyond me. I thought things might get better, but JUSTICE LEAGUE was equally as pathetic. I can't speak of the high definition of that film because I didn't watch it in HD. I can only suspect it's the same.

Anyway I gave it two stars because I wasn't bored stiff. That's for one-star movies.",1527552000,,1668,4.568561872909699

7697992,5,B01D64VSYI,"The Ultimate Edition is the version that should have played in theaters. It is a masterpiece in comic book movie storytelling. Zack Snyder and company weave a very layered and complex tale about two men struggling with identity on the heels of tragedy. This is a deep dive not into the powers of two iconic superheroes, but their psyche in relation to a world that is more like ours than a comic book. Every single time I watch BvS:UE I am able to capture something new from the story. The ""v"" represents more than a physical battle. It is the moral arguments of each opponent as they are pushed and prodded into conflict by a manipulative and sinister villain that resonates this deeply thematic and visually stunning movie. This film raises the bar in storytelling the same way The Dark Knight Rises did so long ago. Everything from the musical cues, to the emotional weight of what hangs in the balance, to the effective and bold new portrayals of these historic characters drives BvS into not just film, but cinema. It is what great movies are all about. Watch it more than once. Listen to the music, the dialogue, the way the story unfolds. And research a little about what others have gleaned, such as the Gilgamesh references and the Christianity questions, and it will be revealed as a unique, imaginative, and stunning film unlike any other.",1526342400,,1350,4.70042194092827

7698020,4,B01D64VSYI,"So I must start with confessing that Man of Steel is among my favorite superhero movies of all time. I found that film both visually dazzling and smart in plot. Man of Steel got 56% on RT, but I would give it 93%. And Wonder Woman easily gets 90% by me (92% by RT).
When I saw the theatrical cut of Batman v. Superman in IMAX, I was extremely disappointed. The plot was complex, but excessively so without any chance to fully comprehend the gravity of each key plot point. The acting was decent, and Wonder Woman's debut was neat, but the film fell short of breath-taking and resorted to suffocating. Just plain ""blah."" RT gave BvS theatrical cut 27%, and I would have given it no more than a 40%.

With all this stated, I will say Batman vs. Superman Ultimate Edition is VASTLY better than the theatrical cut! A friend and I saw it, and we both agree the extended cut gives the time needed to transform an overstuffed film the chance to truly ""breath"" and develop a truly compelling plot that results in a spectacular showdown between two major superheroes. You see more subtlties in the characters of these two opposing protagonists, and the both have more fleshed-out scenes that allow you to build fascination with their stories.

But this cut cannot fix everything wrong with the theatrical cut. For example, you still have a Lois Lane serving as nothing more than a damsel in distress at the film's climax - with no intriguing motive for her actions.

All in all, I would give the Batman v. Superman Ultimate Edition an 83% - it's head and heels above its theatrical cut, and you truly get to enjoy everything in a better-told story process, but it remains a film that has a few (albeit now more-forgiveable) issues that prevent it from getting near the quality of Man of Steel or Wonder Woman.",1524268800,,1800,4.549382716049383

But I seriously hated this movie from start to finish. I felt wholeheartedly that Aflec was the worst batman (says a lot considering how I always felt Clooney had been the worst) The plot holes were so big you could drive an 18 wheeler through and to make it worse they were just over the place with storyline and the reasons why. I felt a lot of the actions scenes were rushed and sloppy. The thing I hated most was the fact of the supposed connection between Superman and Batman had something to do their mom's having the same name even though one was dead and the other wasn't.

From what i gathered about the storyline it seemed to be following more than one particular comic more like alternate universe and planet 52 (i think that was what it was called, friends know more on that than I do)

The crap just made no damn sense from start to finish (I am very open minded and patient when directors wanna make changes or do some kind of twist but this movie was just total crap) I tried my hardest to at least somewhat understand where they were going with the film but i just couldn't. As me and my friends watched the movie they had a lot of the same reactions I did. I was almost done with ever seeing another live action super hero flick based off either Marvel or DC because of the way they were doing stuff (especially this one)",1521331200,,1374,4.301158301158301

7698101,4,B01D64VSYI,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD

It's an ok film, but let's just say I expected better. A lot of the buildup was good, and Lex Luthor was great (though he reminds a bit too much of the Joker) but the final confrontation was ridiculous.
For one, I know Batman is a bit violent but this was insane - he was out for blood at the end of it. I mean, really? And Superman really acts godly - let him talk about being normal, if he wants people to think so. Why does he spend so much time just looking broodily at the camera? And that monster? Well. What the heck. Destroying a city again (sigh). Last complaint - the ending, we've seen before. A few too many times. It's nicely done, but it could have been done better, newer, fresher. There could have been a triumph of good that would result in the creation of the Justice league... but no, it had to be tragedy.

If you're a Superman fan, watch this movie. If you're a Batman fan... you might be angry at him. If you're a Wonder Woman fan - she shows up throughout and she's pretty cool, but this movie is not about her. Mostly, she's there to create a prequel to Justice League.

Looking at the DC Comics Extended Universe:

Man of Steel (reasonably good, should watch: https://www.amazon.com/review/R59FJ62Y7B6ML/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8)
Batman v Superman (should watch for the continuity)
Suicide Squad (I haven't watched because of all the negative reviews but none of these heroes appear in it, so I'm not tempted)
Wonder Woman (totally stands alone, not necessary for continuity, but AMAZING MOVIE, should definitely watch)
Justice League (Hoping to watch soon)",1519084800,,1615,4.736654804270462
7698102,2,B01D64VSYI,"If you're a Justice League superhero fan and okay with enough CGI to choke a horse, you may be entertained, but if you aim any higher, you're likely to be disappointed.  We all love Ben Affleck (Batman) and Henry Cavill (Superman), but they should never teach an acting class, IMO (interestingly, however, Ben's brother, Oscar winner Casey Affleck, who's not in this film, is the real deal).  Meanwhile, Cavill seems to have this I'm-the-best-looking-Superman-ever expression throughout (though that's a judgment call by the viewer).  Oscar winners Kevin Costner (""Dances With Wolves"") and Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Oscar nominee Diane Lane are also, sadly (for the viewer), relegated to very minor supporting roles, and along the same lines, Amy Adams (as ""Lois Lane"") is too good for a fluff film such as this, by a mile.  There's also the protracted run time of 151 minutes, which is surely even more agonizing in the extended-cut version at 182 minutes, not exactly cutting to the chase!  But my domineering reason for a thumbs down for this film is perhaps the worst casting of the century so far with Jesse Eisenberg as, get this, Lex Luthor? Are you kidding me? On the bright side, ""Jar Jar Binks"" (""Star Wars,"" Episodes I, II, and III) has possibly now been dethroned as the most unappealing character (though Lex Luthor is, I guess, human) in Hollywood history.

7698105,4,B01D64VSYI,"I don't go to the Cinema anymore. My biggest problem with a theater setting is that, unless the movie really grabs me, I end up falling asleep.

Now for the same $20.00, if you wait about a half-a-year, and you can own the Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital copy. This package came with 2 DVD edits: the Standard Edition and the Ultimate Edition.

I grew up in DC Comics and cartoons. Despite the slow ramp-up to the action, I really enjoyed the move when the action cranked-up. My favorite scene in the movie was the appearance of Wonder Woman. I can't get enough of Gal Gadot in her sexy Amazon wardrobe. Henry Cavill played a vulnerable but convincing Superman.

7698115,2,B01D64VSYI,"I hate the polarization between the big two comic companies, I'll lay that out to begin with. I grew up with the X-Men cartoon and Batman the animated series and I loved every bit of those shows. Batman had the superior show, and he's always been my favorite hero by far. So I've seen every offering in film and I've been critical of what I've seen. Nolan's films were amazing for what they were, I loved the visuals, the tech Batman used, the villains were better than anything we've seen in Batman films before. But... I didn't love Bale as Batman. He was okay. Better than most, but only okay. So when everyone else was freaking out about Affleck being cast, I vehemently disagreed. He works great as Bruce Wayne, because you shouldn't expect Bruce to be Batman, so neither should you expect the actor playing him. So he puts on the suit and he executes the role, just as we all hoped. Bruce Wayne is the facade, Batman is his real identity, after all. I loved his performance, loved the grittier Batman on screen.

That's the only redeeming quality, save Wonder Woman and her small role in the film. And why I started out comparing Marvel's films and DC's? Marvel has been working extremely hard to tie every bit of their films together. Are they all perfect? No, they have some good and some mostly good. But they started out their franchise with a building universe, character development, even technological development that later allows for the in-universe cause and effect that has lasting results seen later in their films. They don't follow Marvel's comics directly, but they have established their own rules, logic, and storyline to weave an intricate story across multiple movies. So what fell so flat with BvS?

There's an amalgamation of DC comic storylines, origins of the big three characters, the death of Superman, the beginnings to the threat of Darkseid, setting up the formation of the Justice League... All crammed into a movie to create an incoherent plot. Add the really poor CGI, bad dialogue, and character motivations that just don't make sense, this movie disappoints me greatly.

There's a lot missing from the MCU because of character rights, but Marvel has done an exceptional job constructing their universe without the Fantastic Four and the X-Men. Starting out with a Superman origin film and retconning in a very established Batman who's been on the job for years now and we got no preceding film, I have to say that's where I can't get behind this movie and it's building franchise. I'm still on the fence is whether I'll even spend money to watch Justice League, or if I'll just wait until it hits Netflix and watch it if I'm bored.

I'll say I've been really harsh in discussing this film with others, but it's nothing but an Injustice to the great roster of characters DC has to work with. They can do so much better, but I whole heartedly believe that the stress of competition from Marvel's success has led to some critical error and now too much time and money into the project has created a vacuum that won't end well for the franchise.",1518307200,,3080,4.698148148148148

I get the fight between Batman and Superman, but it lasted too long. Batman is supposed to be smart, yet it took him too long to figure things out. He is only human and should have been more hurt than he was. At the end he was scary but Lex didn't seem that intimidated even with madness. Lex is not the Joker. Although I like the actor, I am not impressed with Lex Luther.  With that said, I still believe Ben Affleck is the best Batman and I love Henry Cavill as Superman. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was great. Her character was the best written. I will still buy this movie because I love to see the DC characters. I can hardly wait for the Justice League.

7698185,2,B01D64VSYI,"Ugh.

As if what they did to Superman in ""Man of Steel"" wasn't bad enough, now they drag Batman down, too. Really, if not for the CGI and Wonder Woman, this would have been below awful. I can't even give it an ""okay"". Fortunately, they did fix this a bit in the new Justice League film, but sheesh, there was hardly any room to go down.

The plot is pretty simple. Batman is suddenly a gullible, simpleton who is duped into hating Superman by both his innate distrust of immense power (believable) and some Lex Luthor manipulation (not believable). He is so far from ""World's Greatest Detective"" he makes Adam West look like Sherlock Holmes.

On the other side, we continue to have moony, whiny Kal-El all depressed (and surly) because so many people don't like him. Right. That's why Superman does what he does, so people will like him. Very heroic there, Clark.

So, yeah, Bats hates Supes and Zack Snyder's bromance with Frank Miller has him recreate the big battle between the two. Stick with Miller and Dark Knight. The ending to the fight between Bats and Supes is so ridiculous, members of the audience actually groaned in the theater. Fortunately, on disc, I can fast forward that awkward moment.

One thing Snyder does do well, though, is destruction. The CGI battle scenes are awesome and, visually, this is a pretty and pretty amazing film. I selected it as one of the test discs for my new 4K setup and it's a good choice.

Thankfully, the film throws in Wonder Woman for the climactic battle and she's perfectly tuned on character.

If you're okay with a stupid Batman and an ingrate Superman, watch the whole film. If you like big CGI and big fight scenes, skip to the end. If you're a comics fan hoping to see DC one day catch up to Marvel, start with the Wonder Woman film and go from there.",1514073600,,1807,4.524539877300613
7698186,4,B01D64VSYI,"Ive rarely seen a movie receive as much scorn as Batman v Superman and I wanted to offer my own defense of the movie even as I point out many of its problems. The main complaint seems to be that its an editing mess and I won't deny it has issues. To those who claim the extended cut cleans up those issues I completely disagree and in my opinion the theatrical release is the superior version, if for nothing else than the extended cut explores story arcs that I thought hurt the narrative. Ill start with the films problems and then work my way to a defense.

For me, the biggest problem in the film is Alexander Luthors motivation or lack thereof. He attempts to frame Superman, tries to import a substance capable of killing Superman and works hard to engineer a fight between Superman and Batman. He even blows up the Capitol building presumably killing much of Congress. The question is why? Its not like the comics haven't explored the hatred Luthor has for Superman but it was like the filmmakers decided to leave Luthors motivation to the viewers. This is a major problem and entirely avoidable. His rambling about devils coming from the sky does not fix the problem. Then we have some smaller plot issues. Luthors framing of Superman for murder was absurd since the people were killed with bullets. The extended version goes much deeper into this plot point which is one reason I prefer the theatrical release. Also, why did Diana Prince steal the data file from Lex? I guess she wanted the photo of her old bf but why give it back to Bruce Wayne? Was it because she failed to decrypt it and wanted Bruce to do it and then give it back to her?

I consider the first two Christopher Nolan films to be the gold standard of superhero films. The third film was very good but had some serious plot issues. The difference between Nolan and Zack Snyder is that Nolan makes a lot less mistakes. Snyder loves to swing for the fences and take huge chances (I do realize that Snyder is not actually the writer). I thought the scene of Superman standing in the swirling maelstrom that was the Capitol Building was brilliant. This one is kind of blunted by the fact that there was no reason for Luthor to blow up the Capitol building unless he thought it would somehow be blamed on Superman and the extended version actually goes in that route. Ugh. I also felt chills at the Youre letting them kill Martha even though a lot of people mock it. I am a long time comic fan and it never occurred to me that the mothers of Clark and Bruce share the same first name. It was also an amazing way for Bruce to suddenly humanize the Godlike Superman like a thunderbolt to the brain.

Perhaps my favorite fight in the history of superhero movies was Batman vs. Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. No obvious CGI, no music, just two combatants in brutal combat. Nolan kept it simple while Snyder always likes to go over the top and somehow almost always manages to get a facepalm moment in his action scenes. Why does Superman TWICE allow himself to be caught by Batmans Kryptonite gas? Then there is that ridiculous part where Batman ties a cable around Supermans feet and begins swinging him around. For me, there were a bunch of awesome memorable moments and more than a couple of *DOH* moments in the movie. I would rather have a film with great moments that stick in my brain and a few clunkers than one that is just consistently good. I like directors that take chances unless they produce a true trainwreck (which a lot of people claim Batman v Superman is).

The other big problem is the dark Zack Snyder tone and you either like it or you dont. If you don't like it you probably don't like Zack Snyder films and there isn't much WB can do about that except change directors. Im cool with the tone and when the producers try to slip in some corny jokes that don't mesh with Snyders vision they seem out of place. I was able to overlook many of the films flaws because there was enough stuff that I really liked and I could probably list at least a dozen spine tingling moments. I have no doubt that the people who hate this film are entirely sincere and it most certainly is a film with room for improvement. Its just that in my final mental calculation I found more good than bad and when the film is good its often exceptional.",1513555200,7,4317,4.426415094339623

Yes, it's much better than the theatrical release, but this film still has so many issues - Zack Snyder at the helm being the predominate one, but also Eisenberg as Lex Luthor (seriously - what the actual F*** were they thinking casting him???) - not to mention the fact that they turned Doomsday into an LotR Cave Troll and Batman's character and motivation, while I can see what they were going for, was honestly just a convoluted mess.... As with the new Justice League movie, Gadot's Wonder Woman is the saving grace of the film, which breaks my heart because DC has such wonderful, dynamic heroes and THIS is what we're given.

It's not the worst thing ever made, but as fan of DC and the members of the Justice League in general, this film leaves much to be desired.

Secondly the review of the movie itself. I watched BVS in theaters and it was an ok movie. Lots of plotholes and sudden cuts that didn't make sense. However, I did hear that Zack Synder's original cut of the film is way better and this is true. The Ultimate Cut of the film has an extra 30 minutes of footage and it fills up all the plot holes and the movie flows smoothly.

In terms of this extended version of the movie vs the theatrical version? There's a CLEAR difference. It doesn't fix all of the film's issues, but it helped resolve and explain so many of the fundamental issues that the theatrical version had that it's honestly quite baffling the theatrical edit didn't exclude some of the more pointless scenes and elements (Wonder Woman watching a Justice League teaser trailer, anyone?) to include at least a few of these additional scenes.

first time on the big screen together! The movie itself had a great build-up to the
battle between the two main super heroes. The 'ultimate edition' tied in most of the plot-
holes from the 'theatrical cut' that a lot of people complained about. Wonder woman (Gal
Gadot) was a big treat to DC / comic fans everywhere! The battle between Superman and
Batman was epic and brutal! My only true complaint with this movie was that they brought-
out the 'Doomsday' character too soon! Plus the Doomsday monster reminded me too
much of a Dragon Ball Z character (with the whole 'powering-up' effect / thing). Lex Luthor
was a very menacing character and played-out very well! Ben Affleck is my favorite Batman
to date! Henry Cavill once again nailed it as 'the man of steel'! Plus, we got a little preview
of several super heroes to come... Overall: I loved this version of the movie more than the

In terms of 4k the movie is somewhat all over the place.... For the most part it looks like the bluray edition, which is very disappointing. The only saving grace is the last half an hour, where it seems like someone actually took some effort to make this look good, and it truly does look great.

This movie is strictly C O R N Y !. Ben Affleck is unimpressive as Batman with an over- made hero outfit that doubled his normal size and adding a creepy, foggy voice  that made the poor creature a walking tragedy (or perhaps I should say ""Dark""). I would not want to be saved by him, but Gal, any day!
Henry did OK in his role, but how does The Man Of Steel die? and what fool screenwriter kills him off?..are you off your Rocker?..

The over spilling lightening graphics occurred so often that it was used instead of good acting and script and ingenious action scenes;  and the end creature that killed the Man Of Steel was a total mess, i.e. mistake on very large scale..

The entire movie was a hodge-podge collection of previous faces that somehow were suppose to endear me sentimentally to this Frankenstein of a total failure ""movie"".

Everyone in creating this movie, producer, director, graphics, forgot this is a Comic Book and failed the DC Creators characters to indulge this movie nightmare with incoherent software freaks.  I am sure some will say, wow, what great graphics, I will say thanks Christopher Reeves, et al for letting me turn some pages and have some fun.

7698273,1,B01D64VSYI,"I find it EXTREMELY suspect that so many people have given the disc release of this movie 4 and 5 star reviews. Because this film was a pile of hot, steamy garbage.

There was so much wrong with the ""theatrical release"" that I am really not sure how 30 additional minutes of unseen footage could possibly repair it. In my mind, that's almost like applying a bandaid to stage 4 cancer.

From memory, here's a list of some of the things wrong with this film -- and I acknowledge, before I write it, that it may come out incomplete, as there are many bad things to say about this film and I was only willing to put myself through the torture of seeing it once:
The film opens with Superman rescuing Lois Lane from some terrorists. ... and I'm pretty sure he murdered several of them in the process.
So, part of Lex Luthor's plan is to frame Superman by having the terrorists kill a bunch of people... by shooting them? Because Superman is famous for shooting people?
Lex Luthor's plan makes no sense. Step one appeared to be ""frame Superman using terrorist bullets."" Then he moved on to ""introduce Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne to each other, because I know their secret identities on account of reasons."" Then it was ""Let's get a disgruntled, wheelchair-bound Wayne employee to use his wheelchair to blow up congress, thereby framing Superman again with a bomb (because people will totally think Superman used a bomb)."" Then: ""now I'll make Batman want to fight Superman, for reasons."" And: ""Wait, scratch that last part, I'll kidnap Superman's mom and tell him he has to fight Batman to get her back (hopefully they won't compare mom names)."" Then: ""Well, I have access to a wrecked Kryptonian ship and the remains of General Zod, I'll turn Zod into Doomsday for a reason.""
Zack Snyder really, really wanted his Lex Luthor to channel Heath Ledger's Joker, but he just came off creepy and weird and definitely *not* any sort of genius.
According to this film's subtext, Batman, Superman and Lex Luthor are all analogous to Jesus. Except in that one scene where Lex Luthor compares himself to Lucifer, but then goes back to thinking he's Jesus.
In the actual ""Batman vs. Superman"" fight, kryptonite doesn't appear to do very much to Superman. It appears to be the equivalent of a cartoon mouse throwing a handful of pepper into a cartoon cat's face. It just seemed to vaguely irritate him for a second.
MARTHA.
Why in the name of all the expletives did Lois Lane go BACK inside that collapsing building after she threw away Batman's krypto-spear!?
Why was the setting of the last fight conveniently evacuated? Was it because people pointed out in ""Man of Steel"" how all the wanton destruction of that film's final fight didn't seem in keeping with what a Superman movie should be?
Why was Wonder Woman even in this movie? Was her riveting email-exchange-with-Ben-Affleck scene so vital that it required inclusion? Does Zack Snyder even know how email actually works? Does anyone actually read their email by only scrolling a section of it at a time!?

Just taking this list for what it is, I'm doubtful that 30 minutes of additional footage would have fixed all of these problems.

Warner Bros. just needs to scrap this ""universe"" they're building and start over. They tried to ape the success of the MCU, and have failed utterly. BvS tried to do way too much, and did exactly none of it well.

7698290,4,B01D64VSYI,"I bought this movie for my kids and didn't expect much.  The whole premise seemed flawed, after all, Superman just has to look at Batman to kill him.  Well, I got to say I was wrong.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie.  I'm a huge Batman fan and didn't really care for Ben Affleck as batman.  I know this sounds petty, but his face is too chubby to really look the part.  Christian Bale is by far the best Batman, even with the bad Bat-voice.

All the characters did an excellent and believable job, even Jesse Eisenberg as a young Lex Luthor.  Sure there is a lot of special effects.  But i didn't feel the story line suffered because of it.  I have the 4K version with an OLED TV and thought the visuals were beautiful most of the time and stunning at other times.

If you like the whole Marvel franchise, you'll like this movie.  There is just enough romance mixed in, between Clark and Lois, to keep the women in the audience interested without punishing the guys in the room. Overall, I really liked this movie.",1507852800,,1035,4.305699481865285

  While I find that the ""Ultimate Edition"" is an improvement on the ""Theatrical Version"", I don't find it to be quite the DRAMATIC improvement that some others claim it to be  mainly, because any additional insight that is gained into the motivations of certain characters, is MOSTLY offset by the movie taking even LONGER to get to the ""good"" part (with the ""good"" part being the last hour, or so (in each movie)  which makes sitting through the drudgery that precedes it, (mostly) worth the wait).

  NOTE: I bought this set for the ""Ultimate Edition"" version of the movie (since I had already rented, and viewed, a copy of the original ""Theatrical Version"" on DVD)  therefore, while I sampled portions of the ""Theatrical Version"" of the movie that is contained in this set (just to make sure that it wasn't defective), I don't have any plans to EVER watch it in its entirety. So, all of the following ""VIDEO"" and ""AUDIO"" information pertains to the entire ""Ultimate Edition"" version and a sampling of the ""Theatrical Version"". (But, if I ever do watch ALL of the included ""Theatrical Version"", then I'll come back and update its ""VIDEO"" and ""AUDIO"" ratings above.)

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  2.40:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC

  The transfers of these movies on blu-ray feature images that, while lacking in obvious fine detail, are fairly sharp, with decent contrast and fairly good shadow detail. The colors in each movie are muted and, in some scenes (mostly the flashbacks), even washed-out (which, I'm sure, was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmakers, to go with the somber tone of the movies). Also, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines, dropped frames or color fluctuations to subtract from the images that are presented for each movie. Overall, the picture quality of these movies should satisfy the vast majority of viewers.

AUDIO:  Dolby Atmos  Dolby TrueHD 7.1 (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  My home theater system, at present, doesn't support the playback of Dolby Atmos soundtracks  so, for the time being, I can't review that attribute of the soundtrack for each of these movies. However, the sound quality of the ""plain"" Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack for each movie is excellent. Also, each presentation contains dialog that is very clear and well placed, and both soundtracks make very good use of the rear and side channels  with lots of activity and lots of directionality to the effects AND the music. And, best of all, both soundtracks have lots of deep, and well-defined, bass. Both of these soundtracks are very fine examples of the art of sound design in film  and, they should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest of listeners.

7698315,3,B01D64VSYI,Story could have been way better especially since Dc comics have been writing thousands of stories over so many decades. Many of their animated films is actually better than this movie. But its DC first attempt to bring different characters together on a movie screen. Doomsday looked goofy and the special effects with lightning and whatever coming out of him was distracting. I think it should have been a simple fist fight. The only good thing was batmans warehouse fight to save Martha kent and wonder woman cameo. I like they picked the Israeli actress. She has a very sexy accent. But the movie overall wasn't that good. It definitely could have been rewritten.,1505692800,,667,4.859649122807017

7698319,3,B01D64VSYI,"The first 45 min is very confusing with no discernible plot -- then suddenly it starts to gain focus -- and by the second half it is a good and fairly enjoyable movie. The problem is that you don't know who is against whom and why. There is also very little action in the first half for a superhero movie -- without there being good dialogue to compensate. Maybe that is because superheroes seem to have poor communication skills - with each other at least.

The second half the movie does a 180 and follows the pattern of a normal movie - you can root for one character over another. Wonder Woman comes in as an active character during the last 15 min (rather than a cameo) and is a welcome addition. I found myself interested in what would happen and actually liked it by the end.

So if you persevere, there is some payoff at the end. I don't know if the theatrical version is any better.",1505520000,,891,4.2976190476190474

I saw the new Superman movie a couple of years ago and didn't' think I would like that either, but again, I was surprised.  It too was a very good movie.

These movies and characters are a nice change from the Marvel universe.  I am so tired of Iron Man and Captain America.  I can't wait for the Justice League movie to come out.  For me, it'll be a must see.

The principal actors are all excellent in their roles, I even don't mind the young and slimy Luthor, think Martin Shkreli as an actual supervillain.
The movie really benefits from replacing the pieces that were hacked out by the studio. Half of the Superman side of the story really, most of the actual investigating that Clark and Lois do.

7698369,5,B01D64VSYI,"When Man of Steel released 3 years ago I was looking forward to the new age of Superman movies, now made for a modern audience but without straying away from the source material too much. And while I enjoyed that movie greatly, I was happy to learn that this one will eventually lead to the current DC movie universe which will also give us the very first Justice League movie.

BvS is only the 2nd movie in this universe. While the movie stands by itself for the most part, it really does follow up on the events of Man of Steel. The premise of the movie: The world is still debating themselves over if whether Superman is the hero they never asked for, or just a magnet for death and destruction. Batman, the self- proclaimed Gotham City vigilante, is building his own hatred towards Superman and the consequences of his actions, and starts planning a way to eliminate him which also includes seeking for other possible ""meta- humans"" around the world. Meanwhile young billionaire Lex Luthor finds himself plotting an overly complex plan for dominance which eventually involves pitting both 'heroes' to fight each other. Who will win?

Before going to see the movie initially there were two things that I had in mind and these were really my only two prejudgments: 1) Neither of them should die because eventually they have to be in the Justice League, which leads me to 2) There will probably be some Spielberg- like excuse to have them not kill each other.

With only that in mind, I saw the whole flick and I must say I was actually very entertained from start to finish. The movie does throws you off for the first half of it as it seems to throw random happenings at you, but then as you learn more about everyone's intentions to what they do everything starts clicking. The action scenes are very well made and it really makes Ben Affleck a great choice for Batman despite earlier mixed reactions. Henry Cavil remains a great Superman as well, and for the first time, we get to see Wonder Woman in all her live action film glory, which I must say Gal Gadot killed as well. I really like the political approach to the whole conflict, which is consistent with what Man of Steel built and it totally reflects how today's world would react to such events. I liked this version of Lex Luthor.. it was just so brilliantly portrayed. It was just an emotional joyride.

As far as flaws I can say a few things: The theater version does cut out a lot of plot details that are very important specially right at the middle of the conflict, which we get to see in the Ultimate Edition. This is a rather unfortunate decision that has probably contributed to the divisive reception to the film. Also, there are parts of the plot that seemed a bit forced at times. Such as pitting the Gotham and Metropolis people, their meet up with Diana Prince, and the release of Doomsday. Again, the extended cut does help put better context to all of these, maybe if only a little bit more. Considering the intention of the movie and all the universes being mashed up together probably what people were expecting was a more ""Marvel"" approach of character build up. But we only really got one movie before this one and we will get those in the upcoming years. But, I will give DC the benefit of the doubt and see how they will put everything together. They still have time and they are entitled to do things at their own pace.

Overall yes, BvS is a good flick and it makes justice to the DC Universe. It is not perfect, but it is certainly not deserving of the massive hate campaign it's been getting. The Ultimate edition in particular, is the version you need to watch so you get the full vision of the director.",1502755200,4,3695,4.5007451564828616

7698400,3,B01D64VSYI,"I think the extended cut of this film is an improvement over the theatrical version because it made the plot a little more clear with the added material. On the positive side, the performances by Ben Affleck as Bruce/Batman, Jeremy Irons as Alfred, and Gal Gadot as Diana/Wonder Woman are spot on. There's even some sexual/romantic chemistry between Bruce and Diana that is intriguing. The down side are two miscast roles--Amy Adams as Lois Lane and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Adams is too bland as Lois. She also looks nothing like Lois. I would have preferred Kate Beckinsaie or Jennifer Connelly as Lois. Eisenberg is horrible as Luthor. He's like the teenage love child of the Joker and the Riddler. I wish they would recast him with Bryan Cranston. There also way too much going on in this movie. Not only do we have the Batman and Superman rivalry, we also have Wonder Woman and the whole Justice League set up as well as a battle to the death between Superman and Doomsday. The filmmakers probably could have made at least three movies with all this material.",1501372800,,1070,4.696808510638298
7698401,4,B01D64VSYI,"I'm sure this movie is targeted to, and watched by, diehard fans of both characters with an extensive knowledge of the backstory because I found myself confused on a few points - whether they're plot holes or me missing some important backstory, I don't know. But my first confusion was the main premise of the movie itself - Why was Batman so intent on killing Superman? I understand he was afraid, like the general population and government, that Superman could go rogue and that would be dangerous. I feel like I missed a major point - what happened to Batman that he so despised Superman, beyond reason. And why, when they faced off, did Superman not explain the scenario to avoid the fight in the first place?

The other confusion seemed even more jarring. How did Luthor get into the heavily guarded ship? One scene he's inspecting his Corp HQ and the next he's wading into the ship with complete control over it. Hadn't anybody every entered before him? Why did the ship just give up its secrets to him if indeed there had been others that had inspected it? It seems highly unlikely that sitting in the middle of the city it wouldn't have been thoroughly investigated by the Government.

The X-ray feature helped a lot on some of the trivia and details but didn't offer much in the way of explanation.

The other thing that annoyed me was Jessie Eisenberg. I simply found his portrayal of Lex Luthor to be like he is in so many of his roles...insufferable and over-acting in every scene. It was painful for me to watch him trying to act like Lex. He just seemed to be trying way too hard and his character came across as very cliche.

I did enjoy the movie overall. Good action. Excellent acting. Not normally a fan of Affleck's acting with a few exceptions (The Town, Argo and a few others) but he was very good in this movie. I actually liked his portrayal of Batman better than Cavill as Superman. But both were good. I haven't seen Wonder Woman and I know Gal Gadot has gotten rave reviews but I thought, although beautiful, was terrible in this. I was not at all impressed by her acting. Look forward to seeing Wonder Woman to see if that improved.

Fun movie to watch but definitely requires a strong understanding of all the characters.",1501286400,,2250,4.545679012345679

7698417,5,B01D64VSYI,"I thought this was going to be so bad with everything I've heard. I went into it expecting a bitter pill that I had to swallow if I was going to try to be caught up for Justice League this fall. Perhaps this extended cut is really that much better than the theatrical release, but I found this completely watchable, if not enjoyable. Yes, it is a bit ponderous when you compare it to an Avengers movie, but I found the ""heft"" it presumes totally sustainable. And, at least in this extended cut, I thought the pacing and narrative were well-done, and definitely a step above the candy-striped, ""let's get to the next joke,"" ""we'll all find ourselves on Hawkeye's farm chopping wood,"" lazy screen-writing that was that Avengers Ultron movie (That's a movie that really deserved a 27% on RT, but I'm getting off topic). The film does a good job showing and not telling, and yet (and again, maybe this is unique to the extended cut) I found nothing hard to follow or ""convoluted"" as so many of the critics have said. Maybe that's partially because I saw Wonder Woman before I saw this...I don't know.

The other critique leveled at this film is that these ""dark"" versions of the DC Holy Trinity undermine what we expect from heroes, and especially from sacred properties such as these. Yeah, Batman straight-up kills a lot MFers in this film. This is a concern I definitely sympathize with--I wasn't thrilled that Superman snapped Zod's neck in MoS either--and I don't appreciate it when writers or film makers ""go dark"" to add false depth or moral immediacy. I didn't get that feeling here, and what I think many people are calling ""overly dark"" here is just the film's attempt to bring up the more complicated political and ethical ramifications of a world where some beings have more power than others. This didn't come off as ""trying to be deep"" to me...just and effort to add a sense of realism and raise questions. Does it answer those questions? No. Does it need to? I don't think it does. Marvel's storytelling approach to this question is, ""Let's have Captain America and Iron Man fight about it before they're buds again.""

It's not a perfect movie. Batman's initial zeal against Superman feels a bit forced. That's comic books though...characters always, always, always fight before they talk. It's one of those annoying things about comic books. You can also see the seams a bit as the film tries to both be and not be a Batman movie. But I liked the acting. I like Cavill's Superman. I'm fine with it. I'm stoked for JL.

Final note: I was also expecting to hate Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luther here from what I saw in the initial trailer. But I didn't cringe once. Luther as a silicon valley type with more than a few screws loose absolutely works for me, and, I think, is a great translation of the Lex Luthor character to 2017. The scene where he initially appears to be a young and enterprising silicon valley startup type and ends up feeding the (Senator?) the jolly rancher was an excellent transition from familiar and relatable to deeply unsettling. I haven't been a big fan of the ""Lex Luthor is actually kind of a good guy if you really think about it"" stuff that's been going in the comics for a while now anyway.",1500681600,,3237,4.606585788561525

7698444,4,B01D64VSYI,"I never saw the theater cut of this film, so I can't comment on whether this one was actually better. Based on reviews I've read elsewhere, though, I suspect that the additional scenes were all things that actually fixed the film. I admit that I had lowered expectations, so maybe I enjoyed it more than I would have if I'd gone to the theater. The tone is definitely more pessimistic and darker than Marvel's Infinity War saga, but I don't think it is as unremittingly so as some reviewers claim. Superman's struggle with how much he should do and how he should deal with the consequences of his actions was clear and, while not thoroughly explored, at least it was given enough space in the film to be a significant thread. I was unconvinced by Eisenberg's protrayal of Lex Luthorhe nailed the mad scientist vibe, but Luthor always strikes me as far more controlled. I think the ending was a mistake. Superman's character, and his relationship with the people of Earth, needed one more movie to grow before we got to that point.",1499558400,,1030,4.633879781420765

I liked it the first time I saw it. I liked it more when I saw the Ultimate. And I liked it a lot more today. It's not a perfect movie, but it works, emotionally.

SPOILERS ALERT.

I liked the emotional and mature tone of the film. I liked seeing a Bruce Wayne / Batman, old and bitter after so many years of being Batman. I liked the almost mythological philosophical analysis about the existence of Superman. I was surprised by the emotional connection of ""Martha"" even if it sounds half corny. I liked Clark Kent, and the relationship with Lois Lane felt organic.

I did not like the Superman of this movie. He never speaks. We were not allowed to savor a good super moment.

I liked the Lex Luthor plot, but I did not like Doomsday, let alone the forced way Superman died. It felt was rushed to kill Superman in his second movie. We didn't have the chance to fell in love with him.

I loved Wonder Woman. All about it. She was the best part of the movie.

7698491,5,B01D64VSYI,"As a father of two 'tweens, I have seen my share of superhero movies, and I can't stand most superhero movies for precisely the issue this movie deals with ... the 'judge, jury, executioner' nature of having superpowers.

Imagine I traveled to a planet where the inhabitants were about the weight and consistency of styrofoam peanuts, and I spent my time kicking them to and fro for my own reasons.  Would that make me virtuous, would it make me super?  And even if I did it with the best of intentions, wouldn't they have every reason to fear me?  And how could I assure them, how could I assure myself I would be the one person in history immune to the absolute corruption of absolute power?

It is problematic, and I appreciate this movie dealing with the problematic nature of the ""superhero"" issue.

Spoiler alert:

I disagree with those who criticize the hard turn the movie takes when Batman and Superman resolve their difference seemingly over their mothers' shared name.  For one, Batman relents when he understands Superman's motivation is to protect his mother --- the shared name is merely a device to catch his attention.  For obvious back-story reasons, Batman is highly motivated by the possibility that Superman could fail to protect his mother, and that's the *substantive* reason he decides to help him rather than fight him.

I do think the conflict could still be carried forward with an only uneasy truce between Batman and Superman.  That would make for a better story, both dramatically and, in my opinion, philosophically.

That quibble aside, this movie, in contrast to almost every superhero movie, has well-written, natural-sounding dialog, fewer ""cinema sins"", almost-perfect casting, compelling acting, and truly beautiful imagery that is a breed apart from the overly-filtered awkward CGI of so many movies like this.  I'm deeply surprised that it has received such poor reviews when other movies that I've found almost unwatchable have received near-universal praise.",1497744000,24,1998,5.073394495412844

This move is filled with filler and odd plot decisions, from ridiculous dream sequences that add nothing to the film, useless characters who take away screen time from the titular heroes, far too little action, and a ridiculous resolution to the ""conflict"" between Batman and Superman. The actual fight between the 2 is too short, and just looks very clunky, never inciting the feelings of excitement and tension, it seems to be trying to invoke. This movie had all the resources to be something amazing, but instead is just a boring pretentious misfire on an epic scale. The biggest derailment to the film is the absolutely god awful performance by Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luther. He is unbearable to watch from beginning to end, as his goofy loonytoon behavior is totally out of place with the rest of the film's tone. Henry Cavil turns in a depressing and uncharismatic performance as Superman, while Ben Affleck and Gal Godot try in vain to rise above the lack of material they have been given. The final battle is a boring cgi smorgasbord board of explosions, and ends in a way which is nothing short of downright insulting to its audience. While the the film could have made a potentially bold decision, it predictably backs down from following though. The lone bright spots of the film are the soundtrack, and very cool fight scene involving Batman; which you would be better off just watching online by itself if you can. Overall this movie is a dark blemish on the comic book genre, and an enormous disappointment on every level.",1497657600,5,1685,4.715254237288136
7698495,1,B01D64VSYI,"I see there is an 'extended cut'. LOL Why would ANYONE want to watch an extended cut of this disaster.

Parts of the story might have been OK if it wasn't supposed to be Batman and Superman. Just. like the execrable 'Man of Steel'. Batman using machine guns? Not Batman. Superman unable to come up with clever solutions time and time again? Not Superman.

Maybe younger folks don't know that for decades, Superman's powers generally had NOTHING to do with solving problems. The writers always had problems that super strength and invulnerability didn't get much traction with. If they had, it would have been the SAME story every issue. So every issue, Superman's powers were cool, but it was his cleverness that actually saved the day.

In addition, the writers couldn't decide where they wanted to go with the story. Was it Batman as spy? Was it Superman getting in touch with his feminine side? Was it a threat from Lex Luthor, a victim of the worst casting since Will Smith as James West? And why did they throw in the whole Doomsday fight at the end. Doomsday could have been an entire movie. It's like this disaster was written by a committee of 15 year olds shouting, ""This would be cool"", ""Yeah, and THIS would be cool!"", and deciding to do every stupid idea that popped out.

The whole thing was patchwork, juvenile, self-indulgent, scattered, and stupidly plotted. I could ask questions about why they jumped from Point A to Point E until my fingers are tired of typing. Examples: How did Lois know the spear would have anything to do with Doomsday? Why would Batman ""lure"" Doomsday from one city to the next, instead of just going to get the spear and bringing it back? It really just goes on and on and on.

This pushed what was a fair/good assessment of the film from me previously into the very good/great direction. Haters will likely still hate it, but I know I'm more than satisfied now with this ultimate cut.

Update: After watching Wonder Woman recently, I wanted to go back and watch this film again to see any new revelations that could be grasped. Let's just say that the look of familiar despair on Diana's face at the end of the climatic battle with Doomsday took on a whole new weight after her film showed us her experiences with loss.

7698504,5,B01D64VSYI,"First off, I think the problems that this movie has are problems caused by the studio.  The studio wanted to fit a lot of material into one film, but I think that given their constraints, Snyder man an excellent film.  I think it's an excellent film in spite of the constraints, in fact.  Here's why:

It is impossible to make a work of art that will be loved by all.  Either your art will be safe, earning a golf clap from just about everyone; or it will be dangerous, evoking strong emotions both ways.  This film, I'd say, is the latter.

I've gone to see every single Marvel movie in theaters.  I've enjoyed most of them, but on a second viewing I just find myself uninterested.  They lack substance, and that's precisely why they have such a broad appeal.

Batman v Superman is polarizing, and I'd say the existence of disdainful detractors just proves my point - this movie is actually great.

I've watched it several times now, and I've enjoyed each viewing.  Dawn of Justice is steeped in symbolism and meta-symbolism.  It's a real commentary on the problem of Human existence, portrayed through the stories of archetypes that have existed for millennia.

Kal-El is the ultimate hero, the male at the top of the dominance hierarchy, and he's climbed so far that he is, for all purposes, a literal god.  Bruce Wayne is the sheep dog, and he's worried that this god called Superman could be a wolf in sheep's clothes, ready to annihilate humanity.  Bruce is only a man, and to compete with the gods he will do whatever it takes - the end justifies any means.  Wonder Woman is the hero who answered the call to battle, even though she didn't have to, even though she stood nothing to gain and everything to lose.  Doomsday is the ultimate evil, and you can't run from Doomsday.  Our heroes found, as we often do in our daily lives, that the only way to defeat evil is to fight it head-on until you kill it.  And even then, you have to be vigilant, because where there are conscious creatures, there is always the potential for evil to grow (""the bell cannot be un-rung... he's hungry, and he's coming"").

Superman is Jesus of Nazareth.  It's the same archetype.  A perfect creature comes to earth to save us, and we mistrust it and even try to kill it.  In the end, this perfect being gives his life to save us.  Notice, when Clark's ultimate battle is finally over, they let his lifeless body down wrapped in his cloak - exactly the same way they let Jesus' body down from the cross.  Notice the crosses in the background of this scene.  Lois Lane is Mary Magdalene, weeping over the body of Jesus - or Superman in this case.

None of this symbolism happened by accident.  Snyder directs his movies in this way - he fleshes out the archetypes, he figures out what the REAL story is that is being told, and he cuts out the extraneous bits.  What you are left with is an extremely stylized film.  It's like Bach - everything nonessential is cut out, and what you are left with is undeniably beautiful and poignant, because it's true.  These archetypes, these stories, they cut through to the fundamental problems of our existence, and that's why I find this film beautiful.",1497312000,,3177,4.528998242530756

7698512,1,B01D64VSYI,"This movie is awful. Batman and Superman don't kill people, but this movie apparently has a hard on for death. Both main characters are annoyingly Randian in nature. The movie has a horribly dark, and bland color palette. Whoever color graded this must have mole eyes. The plot was an incoherent mess. Fanboys who only care about the costumes and the names, rather than the characterization and the themes, will undoubtedly love it. Simply out of typical fanboy stupidity. The movie is way to long, and don't let anyone trick you into watching the so called ""ultimate edition"" because it's just more of the same and adds literally 30 freaking minutes to the movie. If your a fan of the comics, you will HATE this. If you're a fan of movies, you will HATE this. If you're a fan of both, I really feel for you.

7698516,4,B01D64VSYI,"I don't have the knowledge of comics and I am not that big on super hero movies. As a film buff, I prefer DC to Marvel because they take risks and don't have a ridged formula. After recently seeing the astounding Wonder Woman, I wanted to go back and watch the Ultimate cut just to see her in action again! When I first saw the theatrical cut of BVS, I thought it was absolutely terrible. It was (and still is to be fair) a cluster fudge of a movie that is trying to be the Man of Steel sequel/first Batman/Justice League part 1 all in two and a half-hours. I walked away thinking that the only redeeming quality was Wonder Woman. I understand why it is so hated but I see it in a new light.

The Ultimate cut is definitely an improvement is most aspects. There are a few scenes I could do without but it fills a lot of plot holes and makes the editing much smoother. The film is actually very well shot and uses multiple film stocks, 16mm, 35mm, 70mm and digital. I highly respect modern movies that still use film and this much variety is actually quite a landmark in super hero cinema. I also really like the question of whether we need Superman and the legislative action that would be taken after such mass destruction. I think another crucial reason I enjoyed the movie this time around is that I knew what I was getting into and had a better understanding/connection to the characters. What little Diana Prince is in the movie is elevated to new heights because I now have more context for her as a character. I also liked Batman a little more after seeing him in Suicide Squad and I think that once ""The Batman"" comes out, this movie will get better. The only character we did have context for, Superman, was the weakest part of the film! It was a mistake to release this as the second movie in the DCEU, but I truly and un-ironically think it'll age like wine. Maybe not fine wine, but some type of alcohol.

However, it has major problems. The script and dialogue is pretty bad. Batman and Superman's motivations are extremely rushed and don't really make much sense WITHIN THE FILM (not the comics etc). Jesse Eisenburg is horrible (think the Joker meets Jar-Jar Binks) and is completely miscast. Lois and Clark are still extremely bland and instead of Lois being able to do way to much like in Man of Steel, she just does a wee bit of journalism and gets captured. The Martha scene is AWFUL. I understand that Bruce sees the humanity in Clark but it is so incredibly awkward and forced. Why would Clark say ""Martha"" out of context and not say ""my Mom""? Then Batman starts to live vicariously through him and it is just all so poorly executed.

Nevertheless, it is an entertaining and visually pleasing movie with a lot of style. I never thought I would be adding it to my collection, but I think it is more interesting than most super hero movies, even if it isn't technically great. It's almost like Heaven's Gate in the way it balances brilliance with stupidity.",1496793600,,2976,4.436928702010969

I don't know why this movie received so much criticism, but the added scenes seemed to have improved the movie.  This is what the movie should have been before it was edited.

This film is a decidedly mixed bag.  The plotting is somewhat clunky and byzantine.  At two hours plus the narrative could have been tightened somewhat.  That said the film takes off in the second half tightening the unwieldy strands from its cumbersome first hour or so.  For nothing else the film cleverly anticipates ""Wonder Woman"" and the upcoming Justice League movie and possibly last summer's ""Suicide Squad"".  My buddy gave this flick a half-hearted endorsement calling it watchable.  Ultimately it isn't as bad as its detractors say but definitely not up to the high water mark of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.",1496534400,2,804,5.083969465648855
7698528,4,B01D64VSYI,"I could only watch about an hour of this movie. It's boring. There were no boobies shots of Lois Lane in the tub, nothing in that first hour to pique my interest. Too talky, not enough action. Lex Luthor is irritating. Too much politicalization in a super hero movie. That's not why most of us watch action movies. Watch this crap at your own peril.

Post Note - I ended up watching all of this long movie. I have to say it was not as bad as I thought. Wonder Woman is indeed a Goddess. Batman - Ben Affleck, started out as a zealot and a nasty prick of a person, but turned out to be an interestingly depressing take on Batman. At least he was nowhere near as bad as Christian Bale. Superman was, as always, THE hero. His ""death"" is obviously not permanent, which is only right. Superman can never die except in some Hollywood BS wet dream about all men being equal. Lois Lane still disappoints by keeping her clothes on. Diane Lane, while getting to be past her youth, is still a gorgeous woman. Editor White needs to be beaten within an inch of his life every other week.

7698533,5,B01D64VSYI,"After the reboot Man Of Steel shepherded by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy), BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE takes the story even further to new heights, and in doing so, opens up a whole new world that has hitherto only existed in the comic books. The PG-13 theatrical version is absolutely magnificent, but the R-rated Ultimate Edition is much better, in my opinion, providing us with newer and longer scenes that enrich the characters and flesh out the story more, just like the Director's Cuts of Gods And Generals, Gettysburg, Troy, and the Extended Cut of Dances With Wolves. I recommend watching both versions within a day of each other so you can mentally and visually compare the differences, particularly in the complex re-editing of one scene in the theatrical version and Ultimate Edition. To say anymore would ruin the fun. I will only say this, both versions are much better than the profanity-laced and sexually titillating Suicide Squad, with two modern-day strumpets headlining the villains; there are no heroes in that picture.

The special features are excellent, and I highly recommend them, with the exception of a purely environmental piece called Save The Bats.

7698542,4,B01D64VSYI,"Like almost everyone else, I didn't like the theatrical release. This 2 hour and 55 minutes is far better. Not 5 stars but better.  Still believe the first 50 minutes is a waste. Bored to tears, actually. But holding out gives a major pay off. Because even then, there's still 2 hours of movie left and IMO, the best. Of course, there are characters I don't like but its still a solid extended release film.

Henry Cavill does a superb job, just like in Man of Steel. Ben Affleck.... well I'm not a fan and to be honest, thought he was the character that brought the movie down. In addition, felt as if I needed subtitles on when he spoke. He took brooding Batman to a whole other level where I didn't relate.  Not sure what he was trying to accomplish but it didn't work and the one liner.... I thought she was with you...fell hopelessly flat. It stank and he needs to find a better way to portray Bruce Wayne's alter ego.

Amy Adams as Lois is ok. I do get tired of her needing to be saved. Superman needs a stronger female partner. The tough journalist act was tired soon as she was hooded in the jeep. Isn't much to say about her and actually if she died, Superman would be better off.

Gal Gadot... amazing. The screen time that Wonder Woman received wasn't enough. Great introduction of the character. The music and lead into her joining the two super heros was great. Music chosen for her was fantastic. She played the character to perfection and it was the same feeling that Man of Steel gave. Good things will come from that role. Unless she's paired with Batman.  Oh wait.....

The most irritating role besides Batman was Lex Luther. Not a fan of Jesse Eisenberg.  Sure a better person could have been chosen. Never considered Lex Luther as weasel like until Jesse assumed the role. If anything, Lex Luther was humorous and goofy dangerous. Didn't get that side of Lex in this movie.

Basically, everyone else was collateral damage or time filler. Completely wasted Laurence Fishburne but enjoyed his screen time.

Had to watch two times. Once without side notes and then with notes explaining scenes. Eventually I'll watch a third time with fresher eyes. Each time appreciating it a little more.",1495929600,4,2206,4.5761421319796955

I was 'broken up' with, and I bought one of his favorite movies. Mostly because the man I was talking to kept saying that we would watch it together. Then he said he didn't want to date, he only wanted to be friends. And that just made me upset. So I loaded up my amazon cart and went to town.

The casing is actually nice, the sleeve is clean (however mind had a little scruff in the corner but Im not going to cry a river over it). When opening it all the disks were organized, the digital copy was the easiest thing to add to my families shared VUDU account (both versions PS.)

7698551,3,B01D64VSYI,"Honestly I looked for every reason to love this film, create an profound and enthusiasm review. For I was one of the individuals that waited non-stop three years for it's release, I've purchased the ticket on Superman's Birthday, seen it early release 2d and 3d (the next following day). Conversely, I couldn't convince myself conscious to go through with it. Here's why:
Man of Steel reigned with surprising courageous action, very well choreographed and produced, although BvS: Dawn of Justice didn't except the moment of Batman saving Clarke Kent (Superman's) Mother, which was the best of it's action in the film.
When Batman and Superman fought against each other, they made it seem as Superman was a weakling who barely had any successful hits because Superman was portrayed as the punching bag.
Worst is the producers (I'm holding Zack Snyder responsible to because it's like he dropped his balls) seemingly made Superman seem weak and passive, with overbearing emotional expressions, seemingly depressed as if the world caved in on him and addition, Superman's fighting skill are poor in BvS while in Man of Steel it was a Warrior level. It's like the degraded Superman and upgraded Batman.
Later in the bonus features I wasn't aware that there's feminist in the cast that are promoting Wonder Woman a feminist Icon, which is deeply disappointing because she's not at all affiliated with them according to the old comic books I've remembered but than the creator mentioned something of Woman's Empowerment Icon, I agree Wonder Woman is a woman of empowerment but don't agree she's associated with feminism. Feminism in this modern time has become ""haughty, wantons, malign, covenant breakers, maliciously spiteful, boasters, and domestically seek to be the Adonim.""  while Wonder Woman always struck me as a woman of treasure, a treasures woman is ""are keepers of impassioned and ardent love . . . "", ""counsels with sensible encouragement"", provide ""ways are of loveliness: the helpmate, an ardent lover, a devotee . . . "" (John Shelton Jones, from Awakening Kings and Princes Volume I) (p. 228-229). In addition Wonder Woman was a woman according depiction of comics as not a gathering of supremacy over man but a sensible companionator of nurture for the love of all mankind and nature. I'm a lot more skeptical of seeing the Wonder Woman movie now that I've reviewed a little of there intentions on a feminism concept instead of a sensible concept, because much of feminism comes with bitterness, victimhood which is not empowerment, malice, hatred toward men, rebellion of submission because of wanting to be in control of nearly everything, and haughtiness.
In BvS the cast is portraying Wonder Woman as haughty, I personally that the plot sequence would be a lot more different in ways of sensible inspiration not the lost hope of mankind, with her looking for a reason to fight evil conflict. Honestly I thought she would be the one to end the fight between Batman and Superman from her venerable ways of caretaking, nurture, love, and fighting skills.
The Superman I remembered was more courageous, forthcoming, aggressive, nobility in the sensible ways (because his similitude is a imitation of Christ), and a strong fighter who remain resolute, aggressive, and patriotic not passive as a punching bag like BvS Dawn of Justice depicts.
Doomsday was unfairly huge creature with a lot of CGI animations, that was somewhat meaningless on certain depictions when he powered up, and *SPOILER ALERT* *died to quickly. During the reunion of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman I thought there would be a lot more action while Batman played more defense, honestly Batman know Doomsday was out of his jurisdiction :) .
With Batman they've done a great job, or should I say Ben Affleck done a great job on producing Batman. Look forward to the future batman films upcoming.
What's revolting me is I had such high expectations of this film, to the fact I just knew it was going to be far better than Captain America Civil War, but turns out Captain America Civil War was far better than BvS Dawn of Justice, the hope is it's not to late for DC to improve, just hope they don't wait to the last of the DC sequel to improve. Suicide Squad was far better than BvS Dawn of Justice.
Truth is I've always been more of a DC lover than Marvel, all because of Batman, Superman and Aquaman and I was fascinated with old comics of Wonder Woman.
There was not much fight scenes for a 3 hour film which is also very disappointing, only a longer flawed plotline of the majority of the film and not much inspiration as Man of Steel or The Dark Knight Trilogy.",1495670400,,4648,4.876106194690266

7698570,5,B01D64VSYI,"I don't understand why soooo many people were expecting this one to play like the Marvel superhero movies. I mean this is DC.We're talking a totally different brand of comic book superhero. DC is kown for being deeper, darker and more thought provoking. I believe that's what critics failed to understand. I love this movie and MAN OF STEEL. Sure, the theatrical cut had its flaws, but I still enjoyed it. I would highly recommend the director's cut of the film to audiences who disliked the theatrical cut. Things are far much better explained in the director's cut. But getting back to why I love this movie and think it's the greatest superhero movie ever made. 1. I like the dark and morbid seriousness to the picture. It didn't need
inside jokes or humor to help carry it. The Marvel movies are light and fluffy and not that very thought provoking. But the DC movies spend a whole lot more time on character development, reasons for characters' actions and reactions, and the overall plot in general. DC doesn't get too deep into the plot right off, unlike Marvel who jumps into the story right away. Rather DC takes time to build into the plot. Not only that. DC superheroes don't find all too convenient ways to defeat the villains; they have to struggle and figure out how to defeat the main villain., unlike Marvel, who offers up all too many convenient ways to stop the baddies. This movie offers us some of the greatest fights in superhero movie history. The special effects are top notch and visually pretty. The cast is superb. Ben Affleck is the only actor to ever portray Batman the way he is in the comics. Henry Cavill makes a great Superman,and I just can't wait for Gal Gadot's solo Wonder Woman movie. I highly recommend this film to any one who likes superheroes. Just don't expect it to be like Marvel or contain the Marvel jokes and humor. This is DC.",1494720000,,1874,4.597014925373134

7698580,3,B01D64VSYI,"This could have been a 5 Star Movie if it stuck to the initial premise of Batman vs. Superman. Let Lex Luthor manipulate Superman and Batman. Then let the super hero's fight it out and there you have it, end of movie. There is enough content and pathos with all of these characters to make it a tighter and more fascinating storyline.

The first half of the movie had this brooding, searching, very human yearning for connection and understanding. Even Lex Luthor had a life that I wanted to learn more about but as soon as that Doomsday monster-thingy came to life, it became just-another-super-hero-movie. Doomsday looked fake, haphazardly rendered, and erased all of the intriguing balances between the characters in the first half of the movie. Bringing in Wonder Woman and Flash was besides the point too. I get that the franchise wants to introduce a whole cast of super hero's but this was done at the cost of sacrificing what could have been a great movie.

Ben Affleck did a respectable job as Batman though I prefer Christian Bale. Henry Cavill did a great job as Superman and Clark Kent. That steamy bathtub scene between Clark Kent and Lois Lane was a welcome surprise. I am a big fan of Jesse Eisenberg but he channeled Heath Ledger's Joker to the point where it became uncomfortable. There were flaws, quite a few of them, but if the writers and directors had just stuck to a tighter, narrower concept this movie could have refined the genre.",1494115200,,1456,4.68359375

Some hated the character design of Doomsday (I don't disagree), and others got confused by the frequent dream sequences. Make no mistake, this is not a Marvel film, it will not hold your hand (don't freak out, I love them all, but they are very simple plot wise.) This is a dark, serious drama, that happens to have super heroes in it. If you look at it that way, and enjoy it for what it is - a well made film, then I can't recommend it enough.

The ultimate edition version of the film adds some scenes that help flesh out the theatrical's more confusing moments (my cousin was confused, not me, and to her credit she has a degree in chemical engineering lol) and some scenes that don't add anything to the story.

7698591,4,B01D64VSYI,"First reviewed at tbirdstudios.com:

Plenty of people, critics included, had lukewarm reactions to the DC Cinematic Universe (DCCU) films. The first entry, Man of Steel, is a bleak movie that did not present an uplifting Superman. A character death meant to inspire Clark mostly failed to resonate emotionally with audiences. The Supes vs Zod fight caused incredible collateral damage, and influenced future action film directors to insert dialogue to the effect that the Final Fight (i.e. where the Hero and the Big Bad attempt to punch each other into submission) does not harm civilians  since 2013, weve seen it in Star Trek Beyond, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even a subversion of this new trope in Captain America: Civil War (where a failure to evacuate civilians redounds on our heroes and creates major plot points). MoS shows us the character journey that Chris Reeves Superman skips over. It is Clark Kents origin story, not Supermans.

Spoilers will follow.

The follow-up to Supermans return, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, is the centerpiece-for-now of the nascent DCCU (at least until Justice League hits theaters in November). The film, whose cumbersome title presages a cumbersome amount of plot, received less-than-positive reactions from audiences and especially from critics (Rotten Tomatoes ratings for the two films show a downhill trend in both categories, though audiences liked both films more than the critics did). Much of that criticism is warranted, but the warmer audience reception highlights that BvS is a solid (if misunderstood) work, and the advancement of its characters makes it an important part of the larger universe.

While MoS showed us a disconnected Clark Kent, who showed little emotion (preferring a good passive-aggressive truck smashing over direct confrontation), BvS shows us a Superman who feels fear, anger, sorrow, regret, and confusion. After the events of MoS, hes caught between having violently broken with his Kryptonian past and having no clear direction for his future. Clark has the love of Lois Lane, sure, and a generalized fondness for humanity (or parts of it), but his interventions are opportunistic, seemingly geared more toward stopping humanity from self-harm rather than guiding us toward a better future.

The extended version of BvS runs just about 3 hours, longer than every entry in the Marvel universe  none of which needed an extended cut of anything. The details the extended cut adds fill out two areas of the plot. The first relates to a Lex subplot that explains why he acts a little loony, which is one of many reasons this film should have been better  director Zack Snyder felt he had to cut vital plot points from the theatrical release to instead show us Thomas and Martha Wayne dying in slow motion. Again.

Another main reason this movie didn't live up to potential is the inclusion of Wonder Woman. My reasons for this are purely plot-based  she shows up for the flimsiest of reasons, basically out of nowhere (cynically, the viewer wonders whether DC/Warner Brothers realized they had a female character they could advance while Marvel was busy cutting Black Widow and Gamora out of everything). Shes basically pointless. If Diana hadnt shown up at all, the only damage done to the plot is that Superman has to work solo in the final act, though wed also probably lose Batmans oh shit line, which might be the funniest part of the film.

One major gripe about Snyders vision is the characterization of Lex Luthor, though thinking again of this film as the prequel to the JL, it stands to reason that young Lex should be different from the bald-headed supervillain. A character who begins the film as a quirky (ugh) tech guy  Mark Zuckerberg with less of a polished veneer  quickly becomes obsessed with amassing and controlling the power the Kryptonians brought to Earth, and even though its only explored (somewhat) in the extended cut, it is very clear that the Lex we see babbling about ringing bells from a jail cell at the end is not the same one that playfully served a Jolly Rancher to a Senator at the beginning. The character is a conniving schemer (though his brilliance is a bit muted throughout), but the question of how much is ploy and how much is induced insanity remains unsettled. There is still plenty of space for Lex to become the supreme unpowered supervillain from the comics; the foil for Batmans technological superpowers.

Speaking of the Caped Crusader, many diehards were also irked at Batmans portrayal as a little too murder-y, but like a horror movie victim I say that theres a perfectly rational explanation for that. Batmans gone over the edge in more than one way. He brands criminals and kills them, and he lies to Alfred about the boat  actions which, combined with the rest of the plot, point to Bruce gearing up to kill or subdue the alien himself. Thats what that first disaster scene (which should have been part of MoS) is all about. Batmans dealt with disaster, but Bruce can compartmentalize that away while out of costume. Seeing it up close, undeniably as Bruce Wayne and powerless to stop it, on top of everything else Im pretty sure thats comic-book Banes cue to start Knightfall. Batman is well over the edge, deep into the black. Like Luthor, Bruce is slowly losing his grip on his world after seeing how powerless he truly is, and hes going to kill Superman or die trying.

So now, lets address the elephant in the room: the Martha thing.

Yes its silly, but consider the possibility that it was just a clunky attempt to clue you into Batmans mindset (since Bats doesnt talk much and he doesnt have an inner monologue). The whole film, our over-the-edge Batman is gearing up for a fight, and at the same time dehumanizing the alien as not a man, but at the end, what Bruce thought were the aliens last words weren't a self-serving plea for mercy or an expression of anger, they were in defense of another person. Batman lost friends and peers (and, um, his parents), hes seen all manner of messed up things, hes killed criminals, and hes realized just how far hes punching above his weight; but hes still Bruce Wayne, not the type to kill a man (even an indestructible one) in cold blood. Hes struggling with the decision even at the point (har) of making it, and hearing that the alien has a mother  and says Zack Snyder, hitting us over the head with the point, shes got the same name as his mother!  tugs Bruce Waynes last remaining heartstring. Its about the pathos of if being Supermans mothers mention, and forget the name coincidence (which again, is just gratuitous point-making).

Oh, and that meaningless character death I mentioned before, from the first film? Yeah, that sacrifice was Clarks inspiration in the final act of BvS, when he literally flies headfirst into that same sacrificial act. Until now, Clark Kent has been living in Batmans depressing world  with similar feelings of loss to Batmans own, by the way  and you can see its wearing on him. Young Clark learned the wrong lesson for his tragedy (in MoS) about burying his feelings and identity. This is where Clark finally learns how to let go of that programming and actually be Superman, not just some other flying dude who stole Supes tights. A real superhero.

This is the true Superman origin story (not Man of Steel), and the foundation for what Im hoping is a more upbeat Justice League, in terms of both the film and the characters in it. Honestly Im optimistic, especially since Snyder has been replaced by Geoff Johns (whose run on the New52 Justice League is pretty good). Im optimistic that history will view these first two DCCU films even more favorably as time goes on and the context of a much larger universe.

Watch BvS with all this in mind. You may not agree that its a good film, but even if you're unable to forgive the Snyderity of it all, its better than Thor 2. Though I guess I have to say, this assumes that how it actually plays out is that Kent becomes the Big Blue Boy Scout straight off the comic page by the end credits of Justice League. If we get another Blue and Red Batman portrayal instead, I may have to eat these words with whatever breakfast sludge masquerading as cereal theyll push when JL comes out.",1493510400,,8262,4.798029556650246
7698592,4,B01D64VSYI,"I admit  I am an unabashed fan of superhero movies. I've seen just about all of them and am a fan of anything Superman. It has taken me over a year to get around to Batman vs Superman for a variety of reasons. The first and foremost reason is the lukewarm reception it received from moviegoers and critics alike last year. I would have passed on Batman vs Superman entirely were it not for the reputation and directorial talent of Zack Snyder. I'm pleased to say that Batman vs Superman surprised me in that it turned out to be a solid, entertaining movie. The action sequences were well timed, believable, and of course exciting to watch. The film was dark, moody, and atmospheric (thank you for that, Zack Snyder). The story itself was an excellent one, flowed along nicely, and was definitely a tale worth being told in the DC Universe.
  *******Minor Spoilers Ahead****One important strength this film has going for it is Henry Cavill's portrayal of Superman. He has proven once more that he is worthy of wearing the red cape and donning the Kryptonian boots. He possesses an 'otherworldly' appearance, and is also a tremendous actor in my opinion. I would be remiss here if I didn't mention something about Ben Affleck's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman. I happen to think he did an excellent job, despite the furor that erupted from comic book purists over his being cast for the role. For anyone old enough to remember BATMAN '89, very few moviegoers believed the diminutive comedian Michael Keaton capable of playing Batman well---but then he exceeded just about everybody's expectations back then didn't he? Ben Affleck was GREAT in this movie as the Batman imo, even though for many fans his famous, recognizable face was maybe a bit too familiar to play this iconic role. The stunning Gal Gadot gave us a tantalizing glimpse at DCs latest incarnation of Wonder Woman. Ms. Gadot was convincing in her brief appearance in this movie, and not at all hard to look at of course! Now on to the criticism....
******There are several reasons why this film wasn't as good as it should have been. The main reason, in my opinion, was the casting of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Jesse Eisenberg is a talented actor, but his portrayal/interpretation of the iconic villain Lex Luthor was shockingly awful imo. Lex Luthor in this movie is a babbling genius(does Lex have Tourette Syndrome in this movie?)who can't seem to keep his lengthy hair out of his face(SOo annoying!). I have nothing against a 'new' portrayal of an iconic character in a movie, but like many fans I was expecting Lex Luthor to be more debonair, sophisticated, intimidating, cunning, i.e.- more of the smooth-talking psychopathic criminal variety. I feel somewhat sorry for Jesse Eisenberg in that he knew he had some rather large shoes to fill in his role as Lex; from the incomparable Gene Hackman to the astoundingly versatile Kevin Spacey and a few in between. (Favorite Luthor was Smallville's Michael Rosenbaum). Lex Luthor was the main antagonist or villain in this film, and yet I was never convinced he was formidable or wary enough to take on and defeat any of the meta-humans--Batman included. My final complaint is that the story didn't have me convinced of the enmity or hatred that motivated Superman and Batman to come to blows near the end of the movie. Batman's purported hatred of the Man of Steel was slowly developed over the full course of this lengthy movie, and made absolutely no sense considering the nature of Batman/Bruce Wayne's personality. Batman is the Justice League's mastermind strategist and in my opinion is far too logical and rational to succumb to the emotional judgements that led him to openly oppose and violently confront the Man of Steel near the end of the movie.
*****  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by Batman vs Superman. It is enjoyable to watch and certainly worth the rental fee and time investment if one enjoys movies in the superhero genre. One of my favorite aspects of this movie was the sporadic humor that I believe was well timed and effectively placed to brighten an otherwise dark, moody film. There was never a dull moment in this movie for me, nevertheless, Batman vs Superman did not live up to its hype for the reasons I have mentioned. It will not be added/archived to my collection of favorite films, but I highly recommend it as a rental regardless.  4 stars out of five from me.",1493424000,3,4422,4.797900262467191

7698620,4,B01D64VSYI,"I don't see what everyone hates about BvS:DoJ, it is great superhero movie with lots of fun and exciting action sequences. The plot and character development is good, and the pacing - although slow in the extended cut - fits with the overall theme of a dark, dystopian futuristic DC film.

The only things you can really complain about are the fact that 1) Wonderwoman was such a minor part of the movie yet occupies the front spot of almost all of the promotional material for the film and 2) there are a few plotholes that are exacerbated by fans' knowledge of the powers and personalities of the superheroes involved. For example, under no circumstance would Clark Kent/Superman ever leave the fate of his adopted mother Martha in the hands of a (Bat)man who just tried to kill him. But he did, which is pretty unbelievable but a feel-good moment for the audience. Also, there is no way that Batman would survive an encounter with Doomsday given the latter's tendency to emit nuclear explosions from its body (which, although strong enough to knock over buildings is unable to kill Batman on several occasions).

But since the action sequences are so well done and the development of the Superman and Batman personas are so carefully orchestrated, most fans will probably forgive the aforementioned mistakes. In fact, if not for the fact that the Marvel superhero movies that came out years before this film, this would have been a record setting franchise in its own right.

Verdict: Great action sequences, good character development and story, some forgivable plotholes. Recommended superhero flick for most fans of superhero movies.",1492387200,,1639,4.952727272727273

7698638,5,B01D64VSYI,"I admit that I bought this movie purely because I was curious.
Batman and Superman as enemies? That premise seemed, at first, outrageous. How, I wondered, could these two ""good guys"" wind up being enemies? What justification could there be for casting them as such?
Then I watched the movie and, lo and behold, I got it. Not only did it make sense to me, I also found it especially relevant to today's world where fear of ""the other"" (whoever that ""other"" may be) is such a central theme of political campaigns and, in fact, daily life. Superman is the ultimate ""other"" in this instance; not just an alien, but a powerful one at that. Batman is, despite his wealth, the prototypical American who conveniently sets aside his own failings while adopting a sense of moral superiority with respect to the actions of others. As an allegory to the world we currently live in, I think this film is brilliant.
It is more than that, however, for it is a film that also gives us hope on two different levels.
First, it shows that people of different backgrounds - an alien and an American in this case - can put aside their differences and unite in order to make the world a better, safer place.
Second, it highlights the fact that women - Diana Prince and Lois Lane - are equal to men: Just as smart, just as willing to shoulder any burden to make the world better, and just as courageous in the face of danger.
(I know, some people will pooh-pooh the idea that women can handle themselves in combat situations. In my defense, I would point to the examples of women demonstrating exceptional bravery on the front lines in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their actions more than prove my point. Want more examples? Cast your eyes back to World War II and the Soviet ""Night Witches"" who scared hell out of the Germans on the Eastern Front or British Special Operations Executive women like Nancy Wake, who once killed an SS soldier in hand-to-hand combat.)
That said, I can understand why so many ""purists"" didn't like this film. It does, after all, paint both Batman and Superman somewhat differently than most fans of these two superheroes are used to seeing them portrayed.
I, however, don't agree with the purists for a couple of reasons including the fact that both the Superman and Batman characters have undergone many, many changes since they were first created. I'm old enough to remember, for example, that Superman and Lois Lane were once married and had a child; that Batman fathered two children with two different women - and was not married to either of them - during his long comic book history. My point is that their characters have not remained static over the years, nor should they. As society changes (I was going to say ""evolves"" but I'm not sure we're evolving much these days) so must our myths and legends if they are to remain relevant.
Additionally, let's be honest here and admit that we are not talking about rewriting history but, instead, are discussing a film based on comic book superheroes. Because that's so, I believe we have to give creative people leave to express themselves in the way they see fit just as we admire the people that created the originals.
I thought the cast was admirable. I've never been a big Ben Affleck fan but I thought he made a fine Batman. Henry Cavill is no Christopher Reeves (but, then, who is?) but he makes a good Superman in this film. Amy Adams is very good as Lois Lane and, though he has taken a lot of heat from critics, I thought Jesse Eisenberg was very well cast as Lex Luthor. In the comic books, Luthor is terrifying not because he is physically imposing but because his madness combined with his genius makes him truly dangerous. Eisenberg, I thought, captured both Luthor's insanity and his intellectual brilliance very well. Gal Gadot is gorgeous and I thought did a very nice job as Wonder Woman. I'm looking forward to seeing how well she grows into the character.
The cinematography is excellent as is the CGI and, though this is a long movie, I thought director Zack Snyder kept the film moving at a decent pace. The costuming is bold and the new Batmobile design is in keeping with the rest of the film's technical gadgetry.
All in all, this is a bold interpretation of the Batman and Superman stories and, for my money, it works..",1491523200,12,4298,4.604954367666232

7698641,3,B01D64VSYI,"I'm giving this three stars just because I was okay with the idea behind the film.  I had to explain the premise to a relative before I ever saw the movie about why two ""good guys"" would be at odds.  Again, the ideas involved in this moral dilemma of how humans would react to Aliens, even ""nice"" ones is curious, and how should superheroes (especially those not of this earth) be held accountable for any of their actions (or inactions) against the ""everyman"". I don't know exactly what was intended, or if it should have been made in the DC universe - there are plenty of ways and settings to make a movie, I just didn't quite jive with this combo.

If you haven't guessed I read comics off and on.  I was a fan many years ago and kind of gave up as they got more expensive.  But I really don't like the characters of my youth being trashed in front of my eyes.  I'm all for Nolan's Batman, those were kind of dark films.  But they worked for a reason, they lent to his character.. like Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight"".

I'm definitely not a fan of Zack Snyder.  What he did with ""Man of Steel"" just about killed me.  The way Superman tore up Metropolis at the end of the film.. ""my Superman"" would never do that hahaha.. but it did lead the way into ""Dawn of Justice"".  I do admit that the look of Batman is pretty good, but between the two heroes beating the hell out of one another, it takes Wonder Woman to come in and kind of save the day..

I don't know, plot wise it just wasn't all there for me.  Maybe some decent ideas that were poorly executed, maybe some things were cut - and it's not just my evil fanboy side talking because I think the actors delivered but the film didn't.. sometimes that happens.

As for that geek inside of me, well it's hoping that after  Zack Snyder's ""Justice League"" is made that it's the last time WB lets him work with the DC universe.",1491264000,,1875,4.24225352112676

That is to say that Marvel story lines had more of the ""Smack, Bam, Pow"" while DC had depth, explanation, more of a critical thinking aspect. In other words, Marvel is eye-candy while DC is brain-candy.

This movie moved fast and took a single movie to explain what Marvel movies would take 4+ movies to get across.

I was skeptical of Ben Affleck as Batman however he played the part not only well, but it seemed as though he was Made for it.

7698685,3,B01D64VSYI,"For those of us who switched from D.C. to Marvel comics when the latter came out - yes, this was a long, LONG time ago - the lure was language. D.C. comics were plain spoken. Marvel's had a much larger vocabulary and something D.C. could never find: a sense of irony and humor. This is true of the films based on those comic books today. What makes Batman translate so well to contemporary audiences, however, was something only Batman had: moral ambiguity. This is why he fits in this film whereas the imposition of contemporary values on Superman feels so forced. It's also the reason why the writers and filmmakers had to devise such a contrived story to somehow make another Superman movie.

You can feel, especially toward the end, the filmmakers reaching for the synergy and humor of the Marvel ensemble films. In this they fail. Ultimately it's really another dark knight tale. Ben Affleck plays the part well as he is a very morally ambiguous person as anyone who witnessed his probably alcohol fueled rant at Bill Maher and Sam Harris two years ago would readily attest.

It's not a bad film really. I'm glad I waited though to watch it via a streaming video service than see it in a movie theater.",1489795200,,1207,4.609302325581395

7698704,1,B01D64VSYI,"much has been made of what's wrong with this film - it's tedious pace, it's dependence on overblown spectacle, it's ludicrous attempts at political/religious symbolism - but the fact is, the true problem is something that runs much deeper. this is a textbook example, in fact a double dose, of the oh-no-not-again syndrome.
both characters made their way to cinema quite quickly, each headlining his own matinee serial in the '40s. the Batman ones were rather shoddy, and have also been called racist, since the villains were Japanese spies. the Superman serials worked better, provided you could get passed (as some couldn't) the fact that he becomes a cartoon when he flies.
television beckoned as well. the '50s saw the landmark series starring George Reeves as Superman, the '60s that starring Adam West as Batman. i've said it before and i'm prepared to say it again as many times as i have to: the ""dark knight"" version of Batman is in fact a shameless ripoff of a character called The Shadow, and the '60s tv series is the very best version of Batman if for no other reason than it's the one time he manages to get out of The Shadow's, well, shadow and become something unique to himself.
in the '70s the same renaissance in special effects that resulted in Star Wars beckoned the Man Of Steel to his finest hour. not only does Christopher Reeve remain the definitive portrayal of Superman, but - with all due respect to Bryan ""X-Men"" Singer and Joss ""Avengers"" Whedon - the first two Reeve films remain the gold standard of the superhero movie.
Batman finally got his own movie franchise at the end of the '80s. despite an occasional good moment, the series was nothing to write home about. to say nothing of the fact that it produced the very worst superhero movie ever likely to be made, Batman Returns. (no, i do NOT mean Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin is Citizen Kane compared to Batman Returns.)
then, in 2005, one Christopher Nolan beat the odds and showcased the ""creature of the night"" version of Batman to his benefit in his Dark Knight Trilogy. those films are almost (not quite, but almost) good enough to make one completely forget about The Shadow.
both lists could go on and on, but you get the point. cinema has been there and done that. it's particularly odd that it should come out now, so soon after it's been said that the big problem with the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films is that they came so hot on the heels of Sam Raimi's trilogy.
Ben Affleck proves a less than ideal choice for the role of Batman. as Bruce Wayne, a vendetta against Superman (contrived as only Hollywood can contrive) reduces him to a one-dimensional Captain Ahab sort of character. his Batman is, with the debatable exception of being able to see, nothing his Daredevil wasn't 13 years before. i actually liked Daredevil once the director's cut repaired it, but the fact remains that Affleck doesn't do much more than recycle the character here. particularly cheesy is his deeper voice for Batman. he sounds like a bad stand-up comic's impression of Darth Vader.
but at least Batman is in his element. Henry Cavill isn't a terrible Superman, but he loses something for eschewing the aw-shucks element so central to George Reeves' and Christopher Reeve's portrayals. people chide Superman for being a goody-two-shoes, but that really is the key to the character. he's the closest thing there is to a superhero everyman, which makes him, to say the least, a little out of place here. i mean really, Superman in an R-rated movie? that's just all kinds of wrong!
a potential bright spot is the inclusion of Wonder Woman. she's universally recognized as the greatest superhero(ine) to of not yet gotten her own big-screen franchise. some cried particular foul that such second stringers as Ant-Man and Deadpool actually made it to the Silver Screen before she did. to say nothing of the fact that she would've represented something new in this otherwise dead-horse-beating of movie.
sadly, the Amazon princess is an afterthought, and it shows. she's so peripheral, and introduced so late, that one wonders just how late in the proceedings they decided to throw her this bone. she's awkwardly shoehorned in and serves no more substantial purpose than that of ballast. one wonders if it wasn't a studio condition, like the inclusion of Venom in Spider-Man 3.
look, we all know movies are a commodity. even those of us who relish the cinematic arts understand that actors, directors, et cetera have to make a living. but i've never seen a movie flaunt it so nakedly. or maybe i should say, make less of an effort to disguise it. either way, the film suffers for it.

7698716,2,B01D64VSYI,"I first stopped watching the movie at about 20 mins into it because its dark portrayal. Eventually I did watch the rest but the initial impression I had didn't really change though the ending was amazing. May contain some slight spoilers.

What's wrong with this movie? By far, the representations of Batman (especially) and Superman were far from pristine. Batman is dark, warped, vengeful, murderous, and cruel. Batman brands criminals with his own Bat insignia, a form of torturing, burned into their flesh, which is a virtual guarantee of death by other inmates once convicted. In another scene, Batman justifies stealing from Lex Luther, murdering people and wrecking havoc with little regard for anything. Batman seems bent on only destroying Superman without any dialogue seeking to understand his adversary. Batman only seems to spout out some idiotic lines like ""Do you bleed?"" as if that's all he can say at his first encounter with Superman. In the fight scene between Bats and Sups, Superman repeatedly tries to talk with Batman--who ignores Superman, almost to being a neanderthal grunt in response, until the very end. It was a sad portrayal of such a heroic figure and I don't really blame Affleck for the role as much as I do Snyder. Affleck was given a script and Snyder's vision for the role.

Superman has also been altered. Good bye are the days where Superman was like Christopher Reeves and the truest form of good. Even though Henry Cavill does the best job in the role since Reeves, he is left to play a Superman with several flaws--even alluding to a dark side to the Man of Steel. I'm sorry, but the only flaw Superman had before was being merciful--which I'm thankful you see AMAZINGLY highlighted in the end. By the end of the movie, I thought to myself ""this is exactly what Superman would have done in any other movie"" though he was wishy-washy up until then. .

Lex Luther was completely miscast. Luther was not a strong character at all. He was a wimpy, blathering maniac similar to the Joker. He was annoying to watch.

One great plot hole, and big spoiler, how does Luther really expect to threaten Superman with the loss of his mother? Sups speed has ranged from thousands of miles per hour to the speed of light. Superman could have gone and rescued his mother before Luther finished his sentence.

Inevitably, this movie portrays what Zack Snyder and the movie forthrightly promotes, ""everyone is flawed."" But purity is what made Batman and Superman superheroes in the first place. They had the highest moral character and were trustworthy to death. Now this movie has made the best superheroes as dark as we are. And what good is hailing a hero with superpowers if they are only slightly better than the villains?

The end was amazing though.",1488931200,2,2780,4.805439330543933

7698719,3,B01D64VSYI,"1. Wonder Woman was fantastic. For all her brief appearances, they raised this movie to 3 stars.
2. Superman and Batman were also well cast, but the script was bad. The heroes were depressed and serious. Ironically, the villain, Lex Luthor, was the only person smiling and cracking jokes. They aged Batman by 10+ years, gave him a super bulky suit, and played lots of ominous music. Superman kept blundering into mistakes.
3. The first scene is a murder nightmare. The second scene looks like 9/11 (it was the battle finale from Superman movie).The story was disjointed, full of dream sequences, and far too dark. Most of the story was set in the rain and nighttime, and the palette was very dark and drained of colour. There are repeated nightmares of childhood trauma. There are long battles where Superman and Batman fight each other in the rain and bash at each other for no apparent good reason.
4. Okay, I love '80's comic books, but I'm a bit tired of the same-ness of some of the super hero movies: (a) A super-powered alien (preferably super gross, with reptile/tentacles/insectoid/fanged/balrog looks and overwhelming firepower) threatens Earth; (b) A large US city with civilians is exploded and pummelled into ruins; (c) Almost everything happens in the rain or the dark; (d) The final battle involves about 25 min of non-stop destruction; and (e) My kids can't see any of these super-hero movies until they're older teenagers. Until then, they'll have to watch the cartoon versions.",1488931200,,1495,4.936507936507937

7698746,5,B01D64VSYI,"Don't believe the (negative) hype! One of the biggest box office hits of 2016 is also a rock solid piece of superhero entertainment. Yes, I also thought Henry Cavill was a little turdish in 'Man of Steel' but he has settled into a true niche with his characterization of Superman. Also I used to suffer from 'Affleck affect' like a lot of you (including some of my most loyal readers), but as he has matured he has moved beyond studliness to exhibit a true acting charisma. As Bruce Wayne/Batman, holy Toledo! He plays the role with a slow burn that has only been surpassed by Mr. Keaton (so that makes Affleck second, followed by Val K, then Christian B, and bringing up the foul-smelling rear is George C).

This leaves Ms. Gal Godot as the one member of the trio I haven't yet covered. As you all know my neo-feminist instincts dictate my feelings for the most part when it comes to strong female co-stars. Well, she delivers as the biggest femme hero in all of comic books - Wonder Woman. Can't wait to see her strut her stuff in the upcoming DC/Warner feature of 'Wonder Woman.'

There are also villains to be reckoned with, chief among them being ""the man"" - Jesse Eisenberg - as Luthor. He's a great psycho, what can I say?? The whole atmosphere of Zach Snyder's movie is chilling and captivating. You really do get a sense of why these two titans of superheroics are at odds with each other! Batman has become a somewhat dangerous vigilante who is willing to exercise his God-given right to bear arms and yes, even take lives when needed and justified. But Superman is believable as an ""unknown"" to Earth, someone who totally scares the ever-loving bejesus out of most of us with all the havoc wreaked in the previous film!

So put all the negativity aside and just kick back with an extra-buttery popcorn, kick off your shoes and socks, and just try to be comfortable above all else as your soak in the DC darkness. Hey I like the Marvel movies too, but they're becoming more and more comedies. Snyder and company are at least intent on keeping things more serious.",1488240000,,2074,4.540106951871658

7698803,2,B01D64VSYI,"Don't believe the DC fanboys who claim this extended version of Batman V Superman suddenly makes it a great movie.  These are the same people who claimed the theatrical version of Batman V Superman was a freakin' masterpiece that the rest of us were too stupid or too brainwashed by Marvel to appreciate.  This version of Batman V Superman is a lot more coherent than the complete disaster that was the theatrical cut but it's still a lousy movie--tedious, joyless, overlong and very badly paced.  It's what happens when you let a director of questionable talent take the DC mantle from Christopher Nolan.

The sequence where Superman saves Lois Lane near the start of the film is still a problem.  Where in Captain America: Civil War it's very clear exactly what goes wrong during the mission and how The Avengers are responsible for extensive collateral human damage as a result, the same can't be said for the equivalent sequence here where Superman is blamed for the deaths of scores of villagers.  After watching both versions of the movie I still can't tell you exactly how Superman indirectly killed the villagers.  How can such an important scene be such a mess?  If shrapnel from the bomb Superman stopped in the sky was responsible why didn't director Zack Snyder include a single shot of the debris reigning down on the village?  The chain of events was actually a set-up by Lex Luthor to turn the world against Superman, which makes the sequence both poorly written and directed because you have to infer too much from way too little that is shown on screen.

Zack Snyder isn't a storyteller, which should have been clear from Watchmen and Sucker Punch before some idiot at Warner Brothers hired him to direct Man of Steel.  That one was so divisive among viewers that the planned Man of Steel sequel was scrapped in favor of the desperation that is Batman V Superman.  Let me say that again.  Zack Snyder did such a crummy job with Man of Steel that Warner Brothers felt they needed to put their two biggest heroes in a movie together as a follow up in order to salvage their DC Universe.  Then fan reaction (outside of DC fanboys, of course) to Batman V Superman was so negative Warner Brothers felt the need to take Suicide Squad away from its writer/director and turn that film into an unholy mess.

Anyone who endured Watchmen should know exactly what to expect from this expanded version of Batman V Superman--glacial pacing, muddled storytelling, lifeless characters you couldn't care less about and imagery that has been storyboarded meticulously.  One sequence in Batman V Superman that actually works pretty well is a reaction to the thoughtless destruction at the end of Zack Snyder's previous DC film, Man of Steel.  Here we see the fight between Superman and General Zod from the perspective of terrified people on the ground.  Bruce Wayne races through the destruction towards his office building, hoping to save his employees from the horror that Superman and his mortal enemy are wrecking on the citizens below.  It's a powerful and kinetic sequence but the movie could have used much more of the same.  Instead, Batman V Superman turns into a dirgelike morass of illogical plotting and boring drama.

Jesse Eisenberg makes for a terrible villain, playing Lex Luthor as an annoying nerd who seems to be obsessed with destroying Superman, but for what reason?  Normally Lex Luthor would have some nefarious plot that Superman would get in the way of, but in Batman V Superman destroying Superman seems to be his one and only goal.

The enmity between Batman and Superman isn't particularly well developed, even here in the longer version of the film.  Both are vigilantes who act outside of the law.  Batman is depicted as being by far the darker and more violent of the two, but that doesn't really justify Superman wanting to take out Batman since the latter is only going after criminals.  And Batman's side of things?  The opening sequence suggests that Bruce Wayne might have a reason to feel a grudge but his justification for ultimately wanting to kill Superman?  If there is a 1% chance that Superman could turn on mankind that 1% is too much so he must be killed.  Does that seriously make sense to anyone?  Batman is obsessed with killing Superman because there might be a very tiny chance that he could go bad in the future?

There's no doubt that if Warner Brothers was going to release this terrible movie, the extended cut is the version they should have put in theaters.  But whatever improvements the longer cut brings only marginally improve the film.  Lois Lane probably benefits the most from the added scenes as she is more than a damsel in distress in this version and uncovers all of the major elements of Lex Luthor's plot--giving Luthor a reason to go after her other than Superman bait.  Jena Malone, whose role was completely removed from the theatrical version also plays an integral part in Lois' investigation and uncovering the fact that Luthor is actually behind everything.  It's always nice to see Jena Malone.  The bombing at the Senate hearing also makes a lot more sense in this version.

Ben Affleck makes for a surprisingly good Batman and I was really looking forward to his solo Batman movie--until he dropped out of the director's seat, which isn't a good sign.  There are even indications that Warner Brothers might no longer be using the script he was so excited about--which might be the reason he dropped out as director.  Henry Cavill on the other hand still doesn't make for a very compelling Superman.  He certainly looks the part, but his take on the character gets monotonous fast.

Batman V Superman partially rights itself during its final section when there is actually some action again--the fight between Batman and Superman is decent but the sequence where Batman rescues Superman's mom is genuinely exciting.  Then Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman team up to fight Lex Luthor's monster, which is also pretty cool.  Unfortunately, there's way too much tedium between the exciting stuff that bookends Batman V Superman.  But at least on home video you can fast forward past the boring parts.",1487030400,2,6174,4.827946768060836

7698843,5,B01D64VSYI,"In Snyder I have trusted.

Even after the bashing this film got I knew I was going to be seeing something truly special.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, goes against the grain in every way from the regular fluff piece we know today as ""The Comic Book Film"".
BvS dives into the darkness, reveals the man/woman behind the mask and gives us the true struggles of being a hero and being a living creature on this planet. I never would have figured that a little movie known as 'Man of Steel' would become the first in a franchise that is headstrong on competing with the MCU. Not only that but, the fact that it was just a whole new film that is very much a Superman story and not called Man of Steel 2. The cast is just wonderful, particularly Ben Affleck as Batman. After the longest time we finally got a perfect cinematic Batman. We have had great Bruce Wayne but, never a truly great Batman. I am sorry but, the Bale Bat-growl doesn't do it for me.

While there are so many people that didn't like story or the atmosphere or even the portrayals of the characters I am sorry you feel that way but, Zack Snyder believes in giving the fans a great film and that is exactly what he did. This was a film for the people that truly love these characters in all shapes and forms. A casual fan is not going to appreciate a film like this because they just don't know. This is pretty much why the Marvel films get praised but, to be honest...most of them are not that good. I will say this only 2 or maybe even 3 of the MCU films actually hold a candle to BvS.

This film for me is the just beginning for something truly great in the world of film. With all the new films lined up for this new DCEU...if they stick to the elements that make BvS so epic and dark I think we are in for some of the truest comic book films ever conceived.",1486598400,8,1831,4.163841807909605

7698847,3,B01D64VSYI,"Batman v Superman is a dark movie. More than not having any jokes, Batman kills using combat weapons by hand, his batmobile, and batplane. He uses his grappling gun as a weapon, and he brands criminals with his batarang, which makes the victims a target in prison for death and Batman either doesnt know or doesnt care. Batman comes off as more of a Punisher-like character than he does as the Batman that we all know in the comic books. Another thing is that they keep using the stupid metaphor that Superman is God, he is obviously an alien, and this gives Lex Luthor room to go on all these anti-God rants.
If none of this bothers you, you do get your bang for your buck. And visually Batman v Superman is pristine to look at; there are terrific compositions, filtered through lenses to give scenes a mythic look.

7698890,1,B01D64VSYI,"While a big fan of both Frank Miller and Zack Snyder (see my insightful comments on his Dawn of the Dead remake), this movie was unambiguously awful. It is a mystery to me how the average rating is even 3.5 stars. Have you people all gone completely insane? Has Amazon finally rigged its reviews to encourage online rentals? When Frank Miller redefined the traditional Batman character in the 80s, it was like a nuclear bomb in the comics book world. Sure, Miller had already made a name for himself with Daredevil and Ronin, but his work on Batman launched him into the stratosphere. Snyder also adapted 300 (another Miller comic) and Watchman to the silver screen, so the guy is almost certainly a huge fan of comics from that era. So what went wrong?

(1) If you really want someone to play the dark knight, then find some cranky guy in his 50s or 60s. Like anyone from the Expendables cast.
(2) When did superman become such a prick? In Miller's work he was more like a soldier following orders, Snyder's superman is constantly angry and scowling for more or less no reason.
(3) Whats with all the dark lighting and grey tones? When was Gotham ever that depressing? No wonder superman is so grumpy.
(4) What was going on with wonder woman and aquaman? They were barely recognizable. I'm not a purist when it comes to costumes, but I sort of think if a director wants to create a new character, they should just create a new character instead of completely revamping old ones.
(5) Snyder's bastardization of the the beloved General Zod character (immortalized forever by Terence Stamp) was totally unnecessary. In spite of all this other crapola, this movie could have worked as a love/hate triangle between Batman and Superman and Luthor. But (5) was the last freaking straw for me.
(6) Why is this called the Dawn of Justice? Was justice truly absent from Gotham really before these guys in capes started chasing criminals around? Police and courts seemed to be trying to enforce the laws, so whats with the snarky remark? Huh?

Snyder is a talented director, and I fully expect his next movie will provide him with some level of redemption for this nightmare he has wrought upon the world. But its difficult to say anything positive about this movie, except that I thought Eisenberg's performance of Lex Luthor was sublime. It is my personal opinion that he lived up to the ridiculously high standards set by Gene Hackman and Michael Rosenbaum. It appears not everyone shares my opinion of Eisenberg, and perhaps this reflects the natural variation that occurs in the appreciation of any experience good. But (1) - (6) are just objective facts which are beyond dispute.",1485993600,,2675,4.7505376344086025

7698892,1,B01D64VSYI,"This movie has so many problems.  The bloated, weak script... utter lack of any joy, humor, wonder or anything but gloom and depression.... plot holes that will make you simply scratch your head in wonder.  Affleck is actually not that bad as Batman, and Gal Gadot as Wonderwoman was one of the few bright spots, but this movie really brings to light how poorly cast Superman and Lois are.  Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is so bad, on so many levels, he needs a discussion space all his own.  Why he starts behaving more like Joker than Lex Luthor by the end of the film is anyone's guess.  Why Clark Kent is always walking around like an angry, depressed teenager is also perplexing for that matter.  Unless you are a lifelong, huge DC Comics fan avoid this awful film.",1485993600,,771,4.510791366906475

I would have preferred if they really wanted to establish Ben Affleck as Batman, fine, do another movie about him as the batman, maybe even the older more experienced batman.

7698914,5,B01D64VSYI,"This was a controversial movie for both movie goers and critics.  In fact, there is aso a divide between the critics and viewers. The theater version of this movie was ""okay""  There were some serious issues with editing and pacing. Characters seemed to be not as well drawn.  There are issues that are brought up that has a lot of weight. Snyder is interested in examining heroes, deconstructing them finding out what makes them tickand what can make them seem real.

The Ultimate cut is a MASTERPIECE.  First of all, several important scenes that explains definitively of the motives of the characters and the reactions of the world.  You find out how devious Luthor's plan is...and how well planned out it was.  You see Superman being more heroic, absolved from much of the blame for events in the movies.  You see a deepening of Batman obsession and how he was pushed into an emotional state.  But above all the movie flows and breaths so much better.  The world and reactions isn't black or white.

But it looses none of it's weight, intellectually. Characters don't act dumb. humor isn't jammed in their in an intense scene. Marvel heroe movies is like the Untouchables. DC movies are like ""The Godfather""",1485734400,3,1210,4.769230769230769

Wonder Woman showed up at a couple of parties to look pretty and tie in Justice League, but somewhat redeemed her inclusion in the movie during the fight with ""Doomsday."" The changes from canon were pretty stupid and made no sense. Doomsday in the books is a mysterious, questionably evil Hulk-like character. Snyder/writers reduced him to a contrived, overly complicated and dumbed down genetic creation. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a joke. Shame on his choices or shame on the director.
TL;DR If they had taken out everything but Superman and Batman, this would have been at least a 4 star movie. As it is, they add in too much crap and didn't think much of it through.",1485216000,,765,4.674074074074074

7699010,4,B01D64VSYI,"I don't think this movie was as bad as critics made it out to be. All in all it was a very entertaining movie. Maybe it's just me but I actually enjoyed Ben Affleck as Batman. Right before Batman Begins came out (and don't get me wrong, The Dark Knight is still one of my favorite movies to this day) the movie I saw right before that was American Psycho. So yeah when I saw Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, I was like OH MY GOD! THAT IS NOT BATMAN! GOTHAM RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! LOL. But anyway here are some things I didn't like about Batman VS. Superman. *POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT. READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE*

In the scene where Batman attempts to steal the kryptonite from Lex Luthors crew, he appears to actually kill people in the process. This defies the very rules that make Batman who he is and how he struggles between hero and vigilante. This seems to happen again when he rescues Klark Kents mother. He shoots the guys fire tank to his flamethrower and blows him up! Holy s*&#! Since when did Batman start murdering people whether they're bad or not?! Another thing that really bothered me was the scene where Bruce wakes up from a nightmare and takes some sort of pill wich we can assume is either medication for anxiety or nightmares or pills for recreational use because he downs it with the last sip of wine out of the bottle we assume he drank the night before. Maybe the director was trying to show a more human side of Batman but I've always known Batman to keep his head clear even when he's Bruce Wayne because he does research on his enemies and is making new gadgets to apprehend criminals or training to keep his strength up. I've been a Batman fan since I was 4 or 5. This also seems to go against Batman's philosophy. If you notice also in The Dark Knight at the Harvey Dent fundraiser party scene thrown by Bruce, Bruce grabs a cup of champagne but goes out on the balcony and dumps the whole cup out over the edge. Other than these flaws in Batman's personality, I thought the rest of the movie was pretty cool. But I wonder....are we really ready for a full fledged justice League movie? How would that sit with the audience today and the movie industry and technology we have today? It's not a bad idea but is this going to be something we look at 20 years from now and laugh at how cheesey it was? Kinda like if you were to watch Batman Forever nowadays or Batman The Movie starring Adam West. Besides for all of that, I thought the new Batmobile was pretty cool except for the fact that...you know......IT SEEMS TO FIRE MACHINE GUN ROUNDS! That would DEFINITELY kill somebody! But they stuck with the classic design both from the animated series and Batman Forever while adding modernized things to it. I also liked the scene where Batman breaks into Lex Luthors gangs hideout and kicks everyone's Ass! This is an awesome scene and I feel like so,easy of the inspiration for it might have been taken by the Arkham series of video games for playstation. At 1 point Batman stabs a guy with his own knife through the shoulder wich is pretty brutal but wouldn't necessarily kill the guy. We also learn in this scene that Batman has learned to make his helmet bullet proof as one guy attempts to shoot him point blank in the back of the head wich is a realistic approach to how criminals would try to kill him and how he has learned from it. I know they needed to have a reason for Superman to dislike Batman so they did this by having Batman brand criminals with the mark of a bat wich gets them shanked when they get to ""big boy jail"". They brand Batman as ""Judge, Jury, and Executioner."" This is totally unnecessary for Batman to do and it also gets criminals killed. They never make it clear whether Bruce knows it or not. What the he'll is the point of the ""Bat Brand""? Batman would never do this. It makes him seem like he's dishing out cruel and unusual punishment. Pretty much most of the criminals have been taken down by the Batman. It's no secret. This aspect of the movie also really bothered me. The movie almost seems to be another Superman movie featuring Batman and Wonder Woman. 1 more thing I'd like to add is the reference to the joker. Bruce looks at an old suit that says HA HA HA THE JOKES ON YOU BATMAN! And Bruce says to Klark, we have a bad history of freaks dressed up like clowns. Is this a hint of the jokers return in a sequel? Can we really have another legitimate joker after the performance from Heath Ledger? It's unclear, but all in all if you can get past the fact that Batman sometimes kills if he feels necessary and drinks or takes medicine, I would check this movie out. See what you think about it. It's definitely worth seeing at least once.",1484784000,2,4738,4.3718820861678

Batman's fight sequences were very good but thats about where it ends. I like Jesse Eisenberg as an actor but he did not fit the role of Lex Luthor.

And now BATMAN only has a problem with murder, when he's not the one committing it. From LAW and ORDER HERO to shear VIGILANTE murderer - bravo - NOT! Very hard to root for a heartless murderer. He, not SUPERMAN should have died, if either in this movie.

Henry Cavil is perfect to play SUPERMAN. And they should have kept Christian Bale as BATMAN.

The parts with Kent's mom were very heartfelt. And some of the most redeeming moments of this movie. I agree with another reviewer - give LEX a rest SUPERMAN has other villains.",1484265600,,763,4.397163120567376

It's not all that bad! I know that's hardly a ringing endorsement but after all the real bad reviews I read that's what sticks in my head!

It doesn't have the slick wise acre characters of the Avengers bit that's not the style. It's dark super hero stuff. Kinda unsettling. They're all flawed in a dangerous sort way; unpredictable.

I'll agree there are a LOT of flaws and plot holes but I understand the extended cut fills in the gaps.

I don't expect a whole lot from these movies anyway... just wanted an entertaining evening at home and this delivers!

For the record I quit about half the movies I start. I couldn't get 5 minutes into deadpool before I was sick of that ultra cool nonsense! I was prepared to back out of this one by all indications but stuck with it gladly!",1484006400,3,792,4.397260273972603

7699104,1,B01D64VSYI,"I wanted to like this movie SO MUCH! But unfortunately, it just wasn't there... First off, the first half-ish of this movie is quite choppy, doesn't make much sense and has a COMPLETELY different tone than the last half. Then I feel like the last half is just rushed and tries to pack all these characters and battles and set ups for Justice League that it just leaves you confused. SPOILER! This movie is literally called Batman V Superman.... the battle/fight between them was quite disappointing. It's lasts for about 4 minutes and I have no idea why Batman stops fighting Superman due to their mothers having the same, very common, first name?! And I also didn't understand how and why Lex Luthor created doomsday... and HOW he even knew how to do that?!?! And why did Superman have to fly himself WITH the kryptonite spear to kill doomsday, couldn't he have just thrown it? But I think the worst thing about this movie was it was very poorly constructed. It had lots of side plots, weirdly introduced cameos and lots of rushed scenes and ideas that when it all came together in this huge battle that just ended instantly, it left you wondering what just happened. And I wanted to see when Batman stole the kryptonite! I thought that would've been an important part to stick in the movie, and also freakin awesome! But it didn't, and that sucks.

His anger was great, and physical is more the real BATMAN, Strong, cut up good.  As a reader of the origanial Bob Kane comic books in the 1960's, it has stayed with that plot all the way.  What makes this work is Lex Luther, and the introduction of META HUMANS!!!  I cannot wait to see the next one, and the Cyborg.

The ultimate edition is much better than the theatrical release.

This movie is not overly dark, not self-important, or humorless. It is more realistic than your average marvel movie- it isn't trying to give you a comic fix. It's showing us what it would actually be like to have people like this in our world. For me, a way better approach.

Superman is a badass, Batman is a badass, Wonder Woman is a badass and good Lord is she gorgeous. they would destroy the Avengers. The End. Justice League!! Now the End.",1483574400,4,607,4.45045045045045

Good casting, except the Lex Luther character, who kept reminding me of a young Joker.

Now I saw this movie right when it came out and at first I was disappointed, but I watched it a second time and I actually enjoyed. Now there is some parts that are confusing and shouldn't be in the movie but overall its a decent movie not for the price tho. I got this movie from a Amazon gift card so it didn't come out from my pocket. I'm sure the price will go down soon, since of the negative reviews it received.

The missing 30 minutes (extra on the Ultimate Edition disc) explains a lot of what is going on in the movie.  After seeing it on TV I had to go to the Internet to find explanations for many questions I had.  So I advise doing that too. Then buy and watch the Ultimate Edition disc and you will understand.  Don't know why they cut out the 30 minutes of missing scenes.  Great movie now!  Can't wait for others featuring Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg.

Some reviews I have read take this film far to seriously it is a big superhero film and is fun and entertaining. The fans should enjoy it since some of the landmark history of the comics is used generously in the film.
I went in the theater with no preconceived notions at the movie and I feel I saw a good movie. I was thrilled after seeing the ultimate edition it improved the theatrical version and I have watched twice since getting it for X-Mas!

7699205,3,B01D64VSYI,"While I am one of the few that actually enjoyed the theatrical release, this extended version is even better. My gripe here is the 4K video quality. It is obviously a 4K movie at the beginning, end and various slow moments in the middle, but several dark or action scenes look low resolution or even grainy at times (almost VHS or DVD quality). Was very disappointed in this, being a newer, big budget action movie. Of the 4K movies I've seen, this one is of the lowest image quality.",1483488000,,484,4.449438202247191

7699208,1,B01D64VSYI,"So WB has been building up to a Batman vs. Superman movie for decades. The plot was basically already written for them if they looked at the comics. You have the most iconic characters duking it out and you somehow managed to make it boring. That takes some work.
  Snyder and the writers also failed epically on the characterization of Lex Luther and Batman. Batman DOESN'T USE GUNS to kill/hurt people. He swears off guns because they killed his parents. However, Snyder's Batman has a wide assortment of guns and uses the ones on his vehicles to kill people.
  Now on to Lex. You have Bryan Cranston as the obvious choice for the perfect Lex and you get a scrawny hipster who is laughable. It's almost as bad as a tattooed Joker with a grill. DC has the best rogues gallery and they are managing to screw it up.
  The DCEU as it stands is a colossal failure in terms of quality. They have made a lot if money despite terrible reviews because these characters are so well loved. I wish they would hire the minds behind Batman the animated series and the Arkham games to write future scripts for them. Also, WE DON'T NEED TO SEE Batman's origin of his parents dying. Everyone who wants to see these movies already knows his parents are gunned down. Epic fail by WB.",1483401600,,1266,4.458874458874459

7699253,5,B01D64VSYI,"Forget the haters.  A superhero movie that challenges what you know about these characters and presents them in a new light.  We have an emotionally broken Batman who goes too far.  We have a Superman who is earning the right from a cynical populace to become the symbol of hope he craves becoming.  Lex, you'll either love him or hate him, but either way it was a unique choice and in my opinion well executed.  I really liked him and found him creepy and even intimidating.

Different choices for sure, but it doesn't pretend to present the definitive version of these characters as the Marvel movies do.  (That's not a knock on Marvel, I love those movies and they clearly make the incredible work they do look easy.)

Plot holes?  Not so much.  People like to sit ignorantly and watch and call anything that isn't spoon fed to them a plot hole.  The script is well thought out and the character motivations are clear, especially in the Ultimate Cut which really is the only way to watch this movie.

Snyder shoots beautifully (not like Michael Bay at all, despite what many would claim) and the action is excellent.

Yes the movie is dour in tone, but what can you expect from a film bookended by funerals for hope, compassion and life?  It's a tragic opera  from beginning to end and very well executed.",1483315200,3,1308,4.553648068669528

This is a sequel to 2013's ""Man of Steel"" & the second installment of the DC Extended Universe and it pits the Man of Steel (played by Henry Cavill) against the Dark Knight (played by Ben Affleck).

7699257,2,B01D64VSYI,"*******SPOILER ALERTS******* I've marked the spoilers...

First, let me say the actors were great. They did the best they could with a horrendous script and terrible direction. It's the only reason I gave this movie two stars - their acting and the cinematography. The movie was beautifully shot and very artistic.

The plot was contrived and the writers/creators (EIGHT of them, if I'm understanding iMDb correctly) did what most amateur storytellers do - conform the characters and actions to fit how they want the story to go instead of letting the story be driven by the characters and allowing them be true to who they are. Talk about a major disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue was great, but the plot was...well, stupid.

If you love the eye candy, you'll enjoy Cavill and Afleck. Gal Godot (Diana/Wonder Woman) is pretty damn hot, too. But other than those cheap thrills, don't waste your time watching this. I'm leery about watching Justice League I and II since most of the same writers are slotted, but being a fan of the franchise, I'll probably end up putting myself through the torture out of sheer hope.

********SPOILER ALERT******STOP READING HERE********

If you know the comic books, then you know how the story ends - Superman dies. He's willing to sacrifice almost anything to save the woman he loves and the story establishes how much Clark and Lois care for each other on a soul-level. And yet when the love of Lois's life is killed...she smiles fondly and kisses him on the cheek????? At his funeral, she acts like she's lost a dear old friend, not the man who rocked her world. And that's the ending of the movie, so ANY redeeming qualities of the film were lost with this atrocious taste in my mouth. Not to mention the lackluster mourning of the world's hero, which only seemed to be demonstrated in Metropolis.

Wonder Woman's part in the film could have been so much better, but she was inserted as eye candy and then a minor nuisance and distraction for Batman. Then at the end of the film, she conveniently comes in to kick some royal ass and save the day...but, again, this story element was contrived.

As for Bruce's reasons for wanting to kill Superman and then how easily they kiss and make up to join forces, it was completely laughable. I think the only character that was true to himself was Lex Luthor (brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg) and how he practically got a woody over controlling these two powerful men. The dark side of the characters were just a bit too dark with no real purpose. I like dark, but not empty deep monologues.

Sorry to those who might have been looking forward to this movie as much as I was. I didn't want to believe the movie was as bad as I'd heard, but at least now I know WHY it was so bad. I guess I had to see it for myself.",1483228800,,2816,4.584493041749503

7699266,2,B01D64VSYI,"What a dreadful movie. It gets two stars (as opposed to zero) because of Diane Lane (outstanding performance in a small role; she is underused) and Amy Adams (doing the best she can in a poorly written damsel in distress routine). Blink, and you will miss Ben Affleck, which is certainly no loss. And, with no eyes visible and a voice changing mechanism, it could literally be ANYBODY in that Batman costume. Affleck is NOT the right actor for this role. How I miss Michael Keaton and Christian Bale. I really think Holly Hunter walked onto the wrong sound stage. What is her standard ""I am so earnest and honest"" routine doing in this movie, verbally sparring with Jesse Eisenberg (whose script apparently said ""Be a full blown psycho the entire movie"")?

Though overall, my greatest disappointment is that this is not a movie for children. SPOILER ALERT. Superman in the bathtub with naked Lois Lane? Superman stabbed to death? Torture? By their very nature, these comic book movies have a degree of violence, but it usually has an unreal component (laser guns, etc). This is a very hard PG 13. I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone.

After a battle which is beyond the pale ridiculous they become allies to battle a Kryptonite monster created by, you guessed it, Lex. The plot holes are big enough to drive a truck thru just a minor example being when Batman's helmet gets shattered the next scene, which is contagious, shows a new perfect helmet. The special effects are over abundant and used to cover the lack of a well written script and plot. Many good actors and actresses are wasted. I really enjoyed the old super hero films where the main characters know the difference between right and wrong. Now everything must be morally ambiguous and politically correct.

The script was terrible, fluctuating between being predictable and cliche-ridden to completely out-of-nowhere (Why did Wonder Woman even need to be in this movie?!?! Of yeah, they need a spin-off film). To be fair, Ben Affleck was a decent Bruce Wayne with the material he was given -  brooding and kind of dark. Ironically, he played an older Wayne/Batman and looked not unlike his George Reeves role from Hollywoodland (a very good film and role for him). Unfortunately, the script for Batman versus Superman was just SOOOOO bad that I think any actor would have had trouble with making this a good role.

The movie's plot was confusing, seemed to lack purpose, and overall felt much more like a large commercial endeavor to sell any people tickets rather than to create or maintain a fan base.

That being said, I love comic books, and love that studios are finally putting out huge productions that are done well.  At least, Marvel is.  DC still quite hasn't got it right, and this movie is a shining example of that.
First of all, Affleck as Batman.  I hated the idea, cant stand him, but admit he did great.  Probably the best part of BvS is him as Batman.  Superman is hard to do. Hes boring, plain and simple.  Hes the eternal boyscout, the always good guy who can fly, move incredibly fast, go into space, survive almost anything.  Impervious to harm, impossibly strong, heat vision, etc. etc. etcthere just isn't any conflict other than his own misguided ethics.  Hes bland and boring, as a rule.  Wonder Woman, well, Im not sure what she is.  Not exactly oozing personality, just seems like a really strong woman with some explosive bracelets or something. Like almost Superman, but with a sword and shield.  Lex Luthor was awful.  Id buy this again if theyd digitally remove the whole character.
So, while I saw this in the theater, and then bought the video, it is from a love of comics, not necessarily because of this movie itself.  Plenty of action, but no likeable characters, confusing plot twists, terrible decisions being made by including Doomsday as they did, and a sloppy, shoehorned introduction to the Justice League.

This Batman, portrayed by Ben Affleck, feels like it was heavily inspired by The Dark Knight Returns series, written by Frank Miller (Sin City), and has a much darker tone than any previous Batman movies to date. This movie really shows a human side of Superman that needs and deserves to be shown, and I think it was an amazing way to introduce Superman, and DC fans, to the Extended Cinematic Universe. This movie introduces the ""Trinity"" of DC Comics: Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and will have an everlasting effect on the future DC movies.

7699339,4,B01D64VSYI,A darker view  of  batman with an older batman (Ben Affleck) who has lost friends due to Superma?Zod battle. He is out to kill Superman in to the mix add Lex Luther and Wonder Woman. The fight scene at end with Doomsday is fast paced with great music. 4K brings great depth and hue to film.

7699363,1,B01D64VSYI,"I apologize for the length, I'm not a film student nor am I a critic. I'm just a 19 year old kid who's so damned flustered, that characters that I idolized, with such rich history and popularity, with great character analyzation and numerous interpretations, could be reduced to such brutes. The titular characters have minor issues that can be resolved through conversations, yet much like the Injustice Gods game they unnecessarily fight, without consequence. Villains and heroes motivations are so blurred, I wound up creating my own charcter motivations for confrontation. I just wish the studio and filmakers knew where they were going before they made movies, that served not even their financial expectations and wasted the potential they had. For me it is a complete misunderstanding of the characters, or just a blatant disregard for the material. I watched it again giving it the benefit of the doubt that they were going for a fresh rendition of the characters, though it fails to live up to any of the expectations it sets up, by lack of explanation from any characters. All characters deliver overly dramatic or cryptic lines, that one would think adults in such positions of power and responsibility would grow beyond, quite the contrary. Admittedly, I went in with biased ideas of what I thought the characters should be, from announcement I was not excited for this film, and I grew up loving the Richard Donner Superman. However, I also grew up watching the Schumacher Batman films, so I know what an under appreciation and disrespect of the character looks like. Then to have my perspective of both characters mature with the Batman animated series, the Justice League series, DC animated films, and have Nolan's Batman Begins touch upon the psyche of Bruce Wayne, further adding depth to that character. Not every comic book film needs to be jokey and light hearted as most of the Marvel films are(but still being thought provoking), and not every film needs to acheive the depths of the award winning Dark Knight film. A line between these can be met if you so desire a great difference from the other brand. Create new stories, don't butcher the hard work of other writers simply because you didn't properly set up this universe. We become who we are through our interpretations of our experiences, and I'm sure we all have something to say about our evolvement of chatacter from thise situations. After decades of good and bad films, everyone's become a critic, and it ain't as easy to inspire children, reawaken the youthful wonder of adult fans whilst both paying homage to old storylines and commenting on and/or informing people of current global social/political events, but some films still do. ""Be whatever they need you to be, or be none of it"".- Martha Kent, whose parents talk like this. I'm just disappointed. That said Wonder Woman looks promising.",1482624000,7,2882,4.944329896907217

The GDs were totally unnecessary and crossed way over the line. 'Nuff said!

It's pretty sad that a 4K UHD Blu-ray movie was made to look like they couldn't afford good cameras. Heavy grain is present throughout. While crystal clear scenes are present, they are rare.

7699462,4,B01D64VSYI,"I originally gave this movie 3 out of 5 stars.  After taking the time to sit down and watch this movie, I've moved the rating up to 4 stars.

The DC Universe is darker and a bit more dramatic than that of Marvel.  However, the two cannot (and should not) be compared because they do offer something unique and special in terms of talent and story line.  Unfortunately, it is DC's darkness that takes away that final star to make it a LOVE versus LIKE.  That and...I just loved Christian Bale as Batman.  People get attached, and the Batman trilogy was and still is amazing!

It took me watching the Suicide Squad movie to take a 5th and more patient look at this movie.  I appreciate these films bridging and bringing a lot of the characters together as they (Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman) also help one appreciate the movies a bit more.

Ben Affleck is great as the new Batman.  Christian Bale will always be my favorite, however this darker (and each iteration of Batman gets darker), older, weathered and bitter version of Batman was done really well.

Love Superman.  In fact, Man of Steel deserved a better rating.  Such a beautiful film.

Contrary to what I stated in my original review, Lois is not a liability.  I needed to pay attention to all the moving parts in this film, and there are a lot.  Bringing together meta-humans and humans in a way that makes sense, and in a way that is done well, is difficult.  This film did a great job in that regard.

I suppose I was looking for a film in which there was less of an introduction of moving parts/characters and more movement in terms of existing characters getting settled into who they are.  After all, Man of Steel just introduced us to the Superman we know today.

Also, as I stated before, this film is a little too serious for my tastes, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  Regardless, the movie is great, and I look forward to Justice League and any other DC film that comes out.",1482019200,6,1961,4.391666666666667

Afflack does a reasonable job playing Batman.  In fact, he was probably the best actor on the screen with the exception of the under used Jeremy Irons as Alfred.

What can anybody say about this movie at this that hasn't been said?  Probably not much.  My biggest complain was the length.  I was tempted several times to turn it off and come back to it.  Overall, it was 'okay' but it wasn't anything special.",1481932800,,492,4.5

I could feel the struggle for Superman and the blind rage of Batman.  They also made Wonder Woman this smokin' bad a$$.

The big controversy moment was about the word ""Martha""--but to me it just seemed like the name was enough to make Batman pause, and in that pause, he realized Supes wants to save his mom just like Batsy had wished he could save his. It made sense to me, and didn't bother me like it did everyone else. Oh, and Lex? He's supposed to be LEX JUNIOR, so yeah him not being bald didn't get to me either. No big deal. The early scenes were ridiculous, like Batfleck walking through a larger-than-9-11 disaster and being fine, but overall it was a silly dark-colored action flick.

The plot is a incoherent mess, it's all over the place and goes  nowhere all at the same time! this purely seems like it was the studios shamelessly plugging their  comeing justice League movies at the expense of actually putting time and effort into building up A meaningful DC universe. And  The ridiculously overuse of bad CGI Clashes horribly  with the terrible muted drab and gray colorscape filter they filmed this mess with. I would say if you can get it at a red box for like a dollar and you have nothing better to do with your time give it a go. but I wouldnt spend anything more on this plotless, predictable, fast food, cash grab 2 hour commercial.

7699524,3,B01D64VSYI,"I'm conflicted about this film. I started with the theater cut. I wish the extended cut had made it into the theaters, though its efforts to balance story lines is marred somewhat by the goofy final battle. At lightning speed, we transition from the best action scene we've seen in a Batman film since Michael Keaton's 1989 bell tower scene. And then ... CGI vomit I'd expect in an Avengers showdown.

This film is a hot mess. There are scenes of greatness. I love Zach Snyder's cinematography: from ""Dawn of the Dead"" to ""300"" to ""Watchmen,"" his use of dark filters and lush colors, the steady-cam focus on action, he is unrivaled in his ability to make camp look cool. However, I was left wondering whether Wonder Woman was necessary, what she actually contributed to the plot aside from Flash-like running and a skimpy outfit. I saw a Rocky-like training scene concluded with an interlude for trailers of future DC Comics films.

The best scenes are all but throwaways: The climactic showdown, a nightmarish dream sequence (I want that film), a rescue scene. Ben Affleck is a dark and brooding Batman, with cool gear and a reasonable voice vs. Christian Bale's CDC anti-smoking ad rasp. Affleck fights like Batman should fight, with the benefit of reach and a tool belt. He doesn't spend the scenes with his fingers stuck to his head, chicken-winging his arms wildly as if someone replaced his shampoo with Gorilla Glue while the camera convulses around him. Affleck actually is menacing in the costume, and seems unhinged. Until Affleck's take on Batman, I had to look back to Michael Keaton's brilliant, bored, understated Batman in a film nearly ruined by camp, or back a few years to ""Kick-Ass"" for Nicholas Cage's ""Big Daddy"" Batman riff. (""Kick-Ass's"" 53-second warehouse scene trumps the quality of the ""action"" in all three Nolan films combined.)

I've respected Jessie Eisenberg's work in the past. From ""The Squid and the Whale"" to ""Adventureland"" to ""Zombieland"" to ""The Social Network,"" he typically provides a taut and thoughtful performance. I'm not sure what the hell happenied here. Eisenberg appears to have augmented a bad carbon copy of his ""Social Network"" performance with methamphetamine. He's just too exuberant and over-the-top to take seriously. In ""The Social Network,"" his occasional flights of anger and ego were mesmerizing. Here, less so. I can't take an ""evil genius"" seriously who manages to con two superheroes despite exhibiting no actual charm or self control.

""Batman vs. Superman"" can be heavy on exposition. It's not, however, a painful plod like ""The Dark Knight,"" best reduced to watching the 15 minutes of the late Heath Ledger's screen time. In addition, Snyder films offer operatic action sequences. Whether it's a showdown or a rescue mission, you're (typically) not just watching a cartoon. The physics and ferocity are palpable. It's nice to see Batman do his work without the hype regarding a magical Keysi Fighting Method we never actually saw because Christopher Nolan's cameramen were suffering from seizures during filming. Or worse still, the plodding steady cam of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" where Batman and Bane take turns exchanging over-choreographed blows while exhibiting no actual strategy or defensive skills.

If you are truly in love with these characters and are an ardent comic collector and fan, there's probably more here for you. The rivalry itself is enjoyable enough. Henry Caville is a magnetic Superman, and Affleck's qualities are noted above. Unfortunately, I find that films in this genre have too many connections to tangential plots and too much name-checking of ancillary characters to get the fanboys salivating about what might be. This way they'll buy tickets again, only to have their expectations dashed over several more iterations and the inevitable reboots.

In conclusion, this film can be described by paraphrasing Roger Ebert's review of ""Alien 3"": It's one of the best-looking bad movies I've ever seen.",1481673600,,3995,5.110260336906585

Literally, that's all this movie was. Going down the dark alley, Marvel nowadays dominates DC in story line and in their heroes; not as in the characters themselves, but how they're portrayed. I myself thought Christen Bale was a great Batman, far better than Ben Affleck. And why are they keep remaking the same story lines with different actors?! For reals?! How is the fan base suppose to fall in love with a character when he changes every year?

The only reason I gave this movie three stars is because (1) Hans Zimmer (you can't go wrong with Hans Zimmer) and (2) Wonder Woman. Now, DC... don't screw Wonder Woman up. I'm begging you.

7699547,1,B01D64VSYI,"Pros:

Ben Affleck
Amy Adams
Jeremy Irons
Gal Gadot
Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL's score
Zack Snyder, Patrick Tatopoulos & their crew's production design, particularly the Batmobile and Batsuit
You can see some faint traces of what were once not terrible ideas
Batman had part of a technical character arc, and it was relatively interesting
Better special effects than fanfic
It has funny parts

Cons:

The funny parts are the serious parts
Jesse Eisenberg, or at least Zack Snyder's direction of him
Zack Snyder & his embarrassing, sophomoric philosophy (no offense to sophomores -- you'll learn, grow, and mature way past Zack Snyder!)
Superman is still acting like a complete Zack Snyder
The deranged aggression it inspires in its defenders
There's three hours of it
Was that a jar of urine?
After it was over I realized I had developed a tribal arm band tattoo

I'm usually cooperative/dumb enough to overlook a plot's weaknesses, especially for Batman (Batman 1989 is one of my favorite movies of all time, people!), but even I couldn't ignore how profoundly, uncomfortably, thuddingly stupid this movie and its characters are.

7699566,5,B01D64VSYI,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is an aesthetically beautiful movie with an equally beautiful message. Without giving away any spoilers, the main message that I took away from the film is that tragedy can make us angry and paranoid of those who are different than us, but if we see the humanity in those who are different than us we can unite together for the greater good. That is basically the main story arc for Bruce Wayne in this film. I think this is a very important message when you consider what's going on in the political climate in the world right now.
 It's very sad that this inspiring message went over the heads of many critics and some fans. Most of the criticisms that have been thrust at this film were about the editing of the theatrical cut (which I believe are overblown), but the extra footage in the Ultimate Edition help the movie run a lot smoother than the theatrical cut. Other criticisms thrown at this film by critics had more to do with their rigid ideals about the type of tone comicbook films should have. Many critics and fanboys maligned this film because it isn't stuffed with jokes and gags like the Marvel movies. This criticism is not legitimate because the movie is not a comedy and the filmmakers were always upfront about the fact that this was a dark movie. Fanboy purists also trashed this movie because Superman is characterized and portrayed differently than he was in the Superman movies/comics from the 70s and 80s. This criticism is also unfair because Superman is more than what he was in the movies and comics from that period. This movie actually gives a portrayal of Superman that fits with our current times and does not simply regurgitate the old stereotype that Superman is nothing more than a clumsy Boy Scout. This movie actually challenges these characters and gives the audience a unique story.
Batman v Superman  also has a lot of cool easter eggs and references to the comics. Every frame of this movie looks like it came straight out of a graphic novel. It truly is a beautifully shot film. On top of that, the movie's score is beautiful. I especially loved Wonder Woman's theme music.
If you're a fanboy purist who has rigid ideals about what comicbook movies are allowed to be, this movie will obviously be challenging for you to watch. However, if you're an opened minded movie fan who likes to see characters be challenged and you're okay with a movie that doesn't follow a cookie cutter formula, this movie will be right up your alley.",1481328000,,2506,4.654627539503386

The figurines look more like the new 52 comic versions instead of the film version or the original comic look, just FYI.  And the collectible cards are a great quality, but I would suggest to keep them in the package or find collectible card casings (no bigger than 3"" long by 4"" wide) for their safety and value.

I am no stranger to being hard on comic book movies for their failure to live up to the spirit of the character or the world.  In this movie however I don't even need to reach that far.  The movie is constantly contradicting itself, characters are wildly inconsistent and we are left with heroes who's moral codes can be shaken, bent or broken over the utterance of the right word.  Even if I were entirely ignorant of the source material and had zero love for comics this movies would have been a disappointment.  You want to make changes to these characters?  OK but at least make them consistent.  You want to change the story or the world?  Fine, but the changes should at least make some semblance of sense.

As an example (SPOILER ALERT) one of the critical scenes in the movie has pit Batman against Superman.  Lex Luthor who has captured superman's human mother has given superman an ultimatum; Kill Batman or she dies.  Without going into too much detail Batman is ready to drive the final blow via a krytonite spear when Supreman begs him to save Martha (his mother).  All it takes to sway Batman into joining with Superman is to find out that both of them have mothers with the same name.  Thats it, his entire moral reason for wanting to defeat him is thrown out the window.  All the imagined crimes and slights wiped away simply because their mothers share a name.  (SPOILERS OVER)

Anyway, I was vastly disappointing with this movie on every level.  The characters were sloppy, the story was spotty at best and very little of source material was used in this terrible ""adaptation"".",1480982400,3,1810,4.513846153846154

Superman wasn't the standard goodie-goodie, character he usually is.

Both Bats and Soops in this movie have different worldviews and they did a great job letting not just the character clash, but their worldviews. Both were affected by the other.

7699659,5,B01D64VSYI,"I'm going to review this movie for 1 reason only, and it's for the HDR (4k release) content. My opinion on the movie itself is too subjective, and some people just hate Zach Snyder so they won't watch this movie anyways. Anyhow, let's talk about the HDR, and you're buying this for the upgraded visuals. Let me tell you something, the last half of the movie is SIMPLY STUNNING and if you have a newer 4k television with the ability to handle HDR correctly, you'll be in for a visual treat. This is the movie you show to people that have not seen 4k and HDR before, because the colors and contrast pops so much it's stunning. You're literally going to be amazed how bright some objects in the scenes look. Zach Snyder is known for loving his darker scenes, and this movie is very dark in tone and in plot, but then he amazes us with a visual treat when the action  picks up and that dark mood is met with explosions, bright glowing kryptonite, and heat vision eye blasts. If there was a way to capture the image to prove this to you, I would do so and upload it. For now, you need the right type of UHD HDTV that is calibrated and can handle HDR content, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The movies for 4k with HDR are lacking right now, and you want to show off?

7699705,2,B01D64VSYI,"One of the major movie disappointments (Superhero one at that) of 2016 and of all time. The Ultimate [Extended] Cut makes up for the version we ended up getting in theatres prior, just like Suicide Squad.

As a fan of Batman and a not-so-one of Superman, I was really hoping like many people that this would be the biggest comic book movie event that would change the landscape of Superhero Cinema (like The Avengers, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man and the X-Men movies before, in between and after them) forever, but sadly ended up being a pure letdown, for a semi somewhat sequel to 2013's Man of Steel but mainly setting up the DC Extended Universe, which somehow wants to out dominate the Marvel Cinematic Universe just to give Marvel lovers a run for DC's money. The only highlights I would like to give Batman v. Superman is:

1. Ben Affleck's Batman (ok Christian Bale fans, sue me)
2. Wonder Woman's introduction into live action DC comic cinema.
3. The somewhat epic-but-mostly-lackluster battle between the Dark Knight and Man of Steel.
4. More interactions between Clark and Lois unlike in the previous film.
5..... The Extended Edition/director's cut, which is rated R.

Everything else was muddled and was all over the place. Hated Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. The guy is yet again another ""somewhat"" villain (following Jamie Foxx in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) as Electro) to be another villain to be another replication of Jim Carrey's Riddler from Batman Forever (1995). I would've liked it if Bryan Cranston to play Lex if he wanted to since he was bald when playing Walter White in Breaking Bad. Too many characters to focus on. Rushed set up to begin the DCEU. Weak music score by Hans Zimmer (cannot believe this was his final Superhero movie score to have work on), incoherent storyline, so on. I bet Suicide Squad might be better or worse than this.

7699716,4,B01D64VSYI,"Released in 2016 and directed by Zach Snyder, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice pits Batman against Superman via the manipulations of Lex Luthor. Wonder Woman joins the Words Finest duo to take on the Hulk-on-Krytonian-steroids Doomsday in the climatic battle.

I viewed the Ultimate edition, which runs three hours; the theatrical version is a half hour shorter.

This is an ambitious film, a superhero epic, touted by DC fans as the movie that would crush Marvels supremacy in the superhero movie market, but it was a disappointment due to its sluggish story. It takes about half the film just to build up any drive; the first hour is the worst, although its not without highlights. Thankfully, the second half is compelling to the end.

Despite the listlessness of the first half, this is an impressive film and worthwhile for several reasons. For one, this is the absolute best depiction of Superman, as far as driving home his alien super-ness. Not to mention Henry Cavill is, by far, the best actor to play the Kryptonian. Secondly, the gritty realistic tone establishes in no uncertain terms that this is a totally serious superhero flick, which is driven home in the first act by the shocking murder of an iconic Superman Family character. Its akin to the feel of Nolans Batman trilogy or 2003s Hulk, the latter of which people love to hate because, apparently, it was a thinking-persons superhero film and didn't have enough Hulk smash moments (even though the Hulks 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is definitely one of the best action sequences put to film). (But, don't get me wrong, I agree with the main criticisms of Hulk, I just don't let them prevent me from enjoying its good points).

Thirdly, Ben Affleck makes for a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, on par with George Clooneys underrated depiction in 1997s Batman & Robin. Hes just all-around better than Christian Bale. Fourthly, Jesse Eisenberg is charismatic as the eccentric, but genius Lex Luthor. For anyone whos upset that he has a full head of hair, stay around till the end. Fifthly, Gal Gadot is effective as Wonder Woman due to her good looks and all-around athleticism (shes too tall and thin for my personal tastes, but shes great for the role of the Amazonian warrior princess).

One annoying cavil is that CNN (Counterfeit News Network) obviously paid for constant advertising throughout the film. See Iron Man 2 (2010) for a superhero flick that knows how to present the news of the comic book world.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a one-of-a-kind superhero film with numerous highlights, like the ultra-serious tone, the best depiction of Superman ever, an offbeat-but-magnetic Luthor, Afflecks great portrayal of Wayne/Batman and the inclusion of Wonder Woman. But the first half is bogged down by a lethargic story with too much fat. They coulda and shoulda stripped this down to a roughly two-hour flick. As it is, it cant compete with more kinetic superhero films like Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and Captain America: Civil War (2016).

ADDITIONAL CAST MEMBERS: Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, Diane Lane & Kevin Costner appear as Clarks parents, Laurence Fishburne is on hand as Perry White, Holly Hunter plays a senator,  Jeremy Irons appears as Alfred and cutie Rebecca Buller is on hand as Jenny, an employee at the Daily Planet.

FILMING LOCATIONS: Detroit (Metropolis); Birmingham, Michigan; Chicago; Yorkville, Illinois (Smallville); East Los Angeles College, Monterey Park, California (Gotham vs Metropolis football game);  Deming, New Mexico (Nairomi, Africa); and Washington DC.

7699735,3,B01D64VSYI,"I wanted to love this movie.  I grew up a Marvel fan, but switched to DC as I got older.  The Marvel movies, have generally been top notch, while DC has been just meh, The Man of Steel movie was a step in the right direction, but it had flaws. This movie is no exception.  Here's some feedback (SPOILERS):
1. The movie tried way to hard.  The movie includes an almost Frank Miller Dark Knight like battle, Lex Luthor, Doomsday and the Death of Superman.  On top of that, this movie was setting up a Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Justice League movie.  Too much going on and it dilutes the story.
2. Ben Affleck's Batman is okay.  It was neither stellar nor horrible. It's an older portrayal. The character is much more brutal than previously portrayed.
3. The Aquaman cameo was a little of a letdown...but I am intrigued about future appearances.
4. The Flash cameo was barely even that.
5. The Cyborg cameo as interesting and has me intrigued.
6. Wonder Woman's appearance and role were one of the highlights.  She was tough, mysterious and her battle scenes were epic.
7. I was not a fan of the more overtly eccentric and insane Luthor characterization.  Luthor is brilliant and evil, but it is usually a more thought out CYA type of evil with no traceability back to him.

It was an average movie. The saving grace is my love of the genre. I think it tried too hard and in doing so lost a little bit.  Fingers-crossed that Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Justice League are a step up.",1480377600,,1477,4.4535315985130115

The shoehorned setup of the Justice League and the DC Movie Universe is also super groan worthy. They can't compete with Marvel, but DC puts in a decent effort with this super overhyped movie.",1480291200,,422,4.565789473684211
7699739,2,B01D64VSYI,"I can't believe anyone thought this story was a good idea. It was so far off track that it reminds me of the old ""imaginary story"" comics from the silver age when DC writers would spin alternate timeline yarns like Lois marries Lex Luthor or Superman's spaceship landed in soviet Russia and not the US midwest.
Batman is supposed to be a brilliant detective (Detective Comics, remember?) and Superman is supposed to use his wit and experience when his super powers are not enough. Not so in this film. The hero characters in this film are men so thuggish, witless and dull that I wondered if they even had their boots on the correct feet. I was never clear on why they were so dead set against each other. I kept waiting for one of them to shout, ""Mongo only pawn in game of life!""
The manic millennial Lex Luthor was often entertaining, and I admire the actor, but his reasons for what he did were just as opaque. He's young, rich, brilliant and evil, I guess that's all. He even had hair.
The only saving grace in this sad, nihilistic film was Wonder Woman. (Please, I hope her feature film is better than this one.) She shows up and starts saying things that make sense, at last, very late in the film. She was awesome to behold in the final battle.
And in that last battle, the giant thingy rampaging about? And the last scene with the coffin. Really? Did someone have a copy of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen script, some Wite-out and a photocopier?
I pity the youngsters who see this movie and think that this is what Batman and Superman are all about. They were cheated.

7699746,4,B01D64VSYI,"What was wrong with this film? There was great interest in the film, 5352 people reviewed it, but the reviews were mixed. There were many moments where there was lots of action, so people who loved action should have liked it. Yet, only 54 percent of reviewers gave the film 4 or 5 stars and 31 percent placed only 1 or 2 stars, with 15 percent assigning 3 stars. What was wrong with the film?
I think it is more than one thing. The primary reason in my mind is that it was way too long. I think that the film needed a better editing job. There were many scenes that should have been dropped, such as when superman has a conversation with his dead father. Others could have been shortened considerably. I would go so far as to say that this action film should not have been 2 1/2 hours, but only 1 1/2 hours, or 1 3/4 hours at most.
I also think that the superman character showed too little emotion. It was as if the film makers wanted to show his strength by having him constantly appear with a stiff lip.
Additionally, it is very clear that this film was designed to be the first in a series, and all the many additions to promote future films of the series, and there were lots of them, should have been deleted.
Furthermore, there was much that was unexplained, and some of what was explained made little sense. For example, why would Batman, who is supposed to be very wise, want to destroy superman because he ""may"" turn bad in the future?",1480291200,,1446,4.3003663003663

7699751,3,B01D64VSYI,"When I first heard they were making this I was wary. DC has not had a good track record when it comes to making movies out of their products. For the most part they come off as trying a little too hard and they don't necessarily fit with the rest of the movies DC has come out with. It makes for a sometimes schizophrenic understanding as to how the movies relate to each other.

With the success of Marvel's ""Avengers"" not to mention their solo movies, DC felt they had to ramp up their production of these things or be left behind. The result was ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"". It's... okay but it's nowhere near the level of awesomeness that it could have been.

I've been a diehard Batman fan for the longest time. Even the 1960's TV show with Adam West had it's goofy campy charm. But it wasn't until 1989 that we got a great Batman movie in the Tim Burton helmed ""Batman"" starring Michael Keaton. There was a lot of controversy when he was hired as he was known primarily as being a comedian before but to a lot of people that grew up during that time he became the best movie version of the caped crusader to date. Say what you want about the others including Christian Bale, Michael Keaton was able to play to the duality of Batman / Bruce Wayne in a way that nobody since has been able to do. Props are given to Kevin Conroy who is my favorite animated Batman but we're talking live action movies here.

We've gone through a couple decent Batman movies since then as well as one that just didn't work, a failed Superman, disappointing Superman and now this. Was it worth the wait? Kinda. Let me explain.

With the Marvel movies they introduced the characters first and gave us a chance to know most of them before the main Avengers movie started. An argument could be made that they're less well known in the public consciousness than Batman and Superman and that's fair but beyond just giving us a change to get to know them, they also allowed us to they were able to spread the story out over several movies and put in important plot points leading up to the Avengers. And this is where this movie fails. It's trying to have too much plot and tell us too much of a story without actually trying to tell us a good story.

What they should have done was show us these events and how it affected both Batman and Superman and their fight should have been the climax of the movie. Everything leading up to it should have been these two getting ready to go toe to toe. Instead we get a combination of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Doomsday"" mashed together along with all the supporting characters that they introduce for no reason other than to tell us they're in this universe.

In a perfect world we would have had a solo Batman movie with Ben Affleck. And I'll admit it, his Batman isn't bad. I've been hard on Affleck for years because I felt he never challenged himself as an actor and always took easy or fluff roles. Compare him to his buddy Matt Damon who was more judicious in his roles and emerged as an A-lister because of it. Ben took a lot longer to get to this point and his portrayal of Batman is good, but I don't particularly like his Bruce Wayne. In any case we should have had this, and maybe introduce Wonder Woman. Not as a character but just in a cameo.

Just like in Man of Steel there should have been a cameo by The Flash or Aquaman. Again, not a full speaking role but just scene were they're there and it's a set up to what comes next.

The visuals were great. The fight scenes were awesome. The less said about Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor the better.

Here's hoping they don't jump directly into the Justice League movie as their next project and instead give us some time to learn about these new characters but I doubt that's happening.",1480204800,,3783,4.347025495750708

I love that Alfred (played flawlessly by Jeremy Irons) has equal amounts of love and disgust for his boy. Alfred is more than a butler, he's the bat's wingman. It was awesome that each of the three heroes have their own individual theme music. The Amazon Princess is heroic and beautiful, as she should be. My only beef with her is: Why on earth was she boarding a commercial airline? Where's your invisible jet, Miss Prince? I actually enjoyed Jesse Eisenberg's wacky interpretation of Lex Luthor. To me, it makes perfect sense for Lex to be off kilter. He's too intelligent, too rich, and too egotistical not to be slightly kooky. Not to mention, he has some of the best lines in the movie like: ""What we call God depends on our tribe, Clark Joe."" or ""The mother of a flying demon must be a witch."" Doomsday is grotesquely awesome and does what we all expected. Kryptonian villains have no respect for property value. I would have liked to see an image of Supe's cape dangling on a pole just to appease us geeks.

Now we get to Batman (Bruce Wayne) who is supposed to be extremely intelligent and a great detective and is too dumb to realize he is being manipulated and even dumber not to properly investigate why and for what purpose. And he becomes just plain really stupid by not even attempting to talk to Superman. The only character who had a clear idea of who and what she was was Wonder Woman.

7699760,2,B01D64VSYI,"Fans of super hero movies love to start critiquing these types of movies early, starting with complaints soley based on the casting. Look at some of the actors playing Batman in the movies and we find that people hated Michael Keaton when he was announced but he made an interesting choice. Besides, in the case of Batman, the actor is more Bruce Wayne than Batman. The costume makes up a great deal of the bat.

Oh yeah, this is a movie review  of THIS movie, so let me get to that. With all the up-front complaints of Ben Affleck as a choice for Batman, people were wrong. Given the script, he was a great Bruce Waye. Now, as for the script...that's another story.

Batman v Superman is a gimmick based on a long asked question: who would win? Superman with his strength or Batman with his strategic smarts? In the comic book fifties and sixties, Batman and Superman were buds. Their conflicts were misunderstandings or Superman's attempts to protect the non-super powered Batman from dangerous situations. In the 1990s, writers saw them as polar opposites and wrote darker stories that placed the two at odds in actions and personalities. It almost always showed Batman as the superior stratistician and that smarts could compete with Superman's raw power.

I don;t like this movie. I don;t like what they do to the characters. Here are some of the movie elements that really bother me:
 - Alfred's age: he is too young to be the butler who helped the young Bruce Wayne when his parents were shot.
 - Perry White changes race: why does every tv or movie adaption believe that they need to change the race of a character in order to keep their character mix acceptable to the audience. I find it insulting.
 - The Bruce Wayne dream sequence: a literary license to do whatever non-connected scene they want to in the film and create licensed toys from the costume differences.
 - Superman's appearance of not caring after the explosion in the Capitol.
 - Batman's driven need to destroy Superman. It;s over the top. That should be Luthor's goal, not Batman's.
 - Luthor was just annoying. Not just evil (and definitely not bald), just annoying. More like the Joker.
 - Why is Wonder Woman watching the Luthor surveilance tapes? Why does she care? That should have been Bruce's time. It's a cheap way to get her more face time in the movie.
 - Batman's fast about face when he realizes Superman's mother is in danger. Stupid and out of character, even if their mother's share the same first name.

This is A version of Superman, but it isn't MY Superman, the guy who does the right thing. And this isn't my Batman. It's a cheap trick overall. It's rather like Coca Cola changing the formula and creating New Coke. It has a limited life before people revolt. It's all mean spirited and anything but heroic.

I love my heroes and that's why Warners should hand over the DC Super Hero movie-making franchise to Marvel or at least the people who make the DC TV shows. Conflict is the core of any movie, but my super hero movies give me hope.  This is as bad as the ""New 52"" that DC Comics realized was such a failure that they changed their newly introduced logo to ensure people would know everything was changed. Sadly, the new logo on this package offers none of the promise of improvement.

Skip this movie. Go watch the Flash TV show instead.

7699783,4,B01D64VSYI,"I saw this movie in the theater. I liked it. I can't say that I absolutely loved it, but I certainly enjoyed it and didn't regret seeing it. Once I found out that the Blu-ray version was going to include the extended cut I knew I wanted to see that as well.

The extended cut will likely not change a negative reviewer's mind, but it did offer more exposition and context for some scenes, and I appreciated that. The extras that are included are pretty good. I found the one dedicated to the creation of this version of the Batmobile to be interesting. My only real disappointment is that there was no director's commentary included. I would have loved to have heard some of Zack Snyder's thoughts and reasoning for why and how he made some of his decisions. I think he had a very interesting vision for this film and it could have been illuminating.

As for the tone - I know that the majority of people seem to think that it's too ""dark"" or serious. Well, it is those things, but I don't mind that. I understand that the Marvel franchise has really blazed a trail in the superhero film space with their use of vivid color and consistent humor. I love their movies for that, but I do not feel that all superhero films need to approach the material in that way. For that reason I find this take to be somewhat fresh and unique - at least in the current crop of movies in this genre. In short, I like the tone of this movie very much, even though it is well known by now that DC will be injecting more humor and a lighter tone into their films as that seems to be what the majority of the audience prefers.

All told, I thought this was a great film. Not flawless by any means, but so what? I can say that about any movie so I wasn't particularly offended by some of the things that I thought were unnecessary or that I would have liked to have seen done much differently. That's their take on the material, and ultimately that's what I wanted to see. If I expected it to be the movie that I myself would have made then I probably should have done some networking and landed an influential job with the company. Would it have worked? Nope. I don't think my resume as a casual viewer of movies would have landed me a position. Hence, I'm happy with the product I got to see. I was satisfied and I do think that many others will be satisfied too. The extra 30 minutes in the extended cut is beneficial and added to my enjoyment when viewing it the second time around.

I do recommend this movie. Everyone's tastes are different so I won't tell you that you will love it, or even like it. But I think many will enjoy it very much, as I did.",1479945600,3,2636,4.2345924453280315

7699786,3,B01D64VSYI,"I liked it and I didn't like it.  I enjoyed Superman's angst, I think that's important given the level of destruction he caused in the first film, and I loved Diana Prince, but I absolutely loathed Jesse Eisenberg and he really ruined it for me.  I'm not a DC comics fan, but I know well enough the backgrounds of the main characters.  The opening sequence showing the Wayne parents' deaths was probably the best version of that scene I've ever watched, to include the 1989 original.

That said, this movie slogged.  I have no objection to longer films, and I don't mind a movie that isn't all action, but my god, I had to fast forward through almost every scene Luthor was in because all I wanted was to see someone garrotte him and it wasn't happening.  How Eisenberg still has an acting career is beyond me, he's utterly terrible.  More than that, I watched these two (B&S) waste two hours fighting each other instead of focusing on the real enemy, Luthor.  Never have there been two more short-sighted superheroes in the history of comics.  It was like watching two drunks square off over a bar bag after a long night of drinking.

I still love Cavill as Superman, and I give Afleck props - he completely blew away any objections I had to his portrayal of Batman ahead of time, and I think he's done a fantastic job - but, again, Luthor should have been killed just so I never have to see Eisenberg's smug face again.

On the other hand, someone send Batman to counseling.  He's got parental issues even Freud would be impressed by.

It's an okay film, but I doubt I'll ever waste time on it again.  Really, DC, if you want to replicate Marvel's success, I suggest you find another director like Nolan, because his Batman films are the only DC films worth watching.",1479859200,,1769,4.504702194357367

Like everyone else I was a little apprehensive to watch another Batman after Christopher Nolan's trilogy with Christian Bale was done so well.
Leaving these feelings aside I watched the movie with an open mind.

Overall the movie flowed quite well and referenced previous events in movies well to make sure the viewer wasn't lost in history, especially if you never saw Zack Synder's Man of Steel. Despite some quirky plot holes the movie is done quite well in my opinion. The music and sound effects are superb and the movie is visually stunning. The level of detail put into fight scenes and edited in CGI is done perfectly, nothing is visually straining or confusing to make out what is actually happening.

If you have been putting this movie off becasue of some bad reviews you have read or do not want to because of Ben Affleck give it a chance.

This movie however, appears to be trying to appeal to a rather strange audience, an audience that is more commonly found as of late.. dark and a bit twisted.

Super heroes are supposed to be nice, fight for humans, care and lift your spirits up. These characters however, portrayed by Znyder are just wrong - they are not what I'd want my kids to watch. They represent a new and twisted world. Superman is one of the most amazing characters that epitomizes super heroes, yet this director manages to ruin him and make him look twisted and dark - same for batman.

After watching this movie I had to go back and watch some of the earlier superman movies, just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Tons of money spent on special effects of course and an epic movie in every other way, just not a nice movie. I'd fire this guy and never hire him again for this genre.",1479600000,,968,4.25

7699818,4,B01D64VSYI,"I remember seeing the theatrical release of Batman vs Superman and genuinely enjoying it despite its faults, but still feeling like something was missing. And when the negative reviews began pouring in, I felt more than a little guilty about my opinion that the film was an entertaining (if somber) motion picture. Soon thereafter I received word of an extended release and hoped that it would provide that little bit which I felt was missing from the version that I saw twice in theaters...

It absolutely delivered.

This version provides that little element of heart that was unfairly cut out of the cinematic release, appropriately provided by the character with the biggest heart of them all: Superman. From calling up his mother in the middle of the night to seek guidance and emotional support, to going against his boss's instructions to shed light upon the people who are being hurt by Batman's vigilantism, and consistently helping others in spite of being distrusted and rejected by an unappreciative world who sees him only as a loose cannon (Anti-MoS fanboys, anybody?), this Superman provides the most human element of the story in this, THE definitive version of Batman vs Superman. In fact I find it very hard to regard him as the dark and violent sadist that the detractors of these DC movies see him as, considering that he does pretty much nothing to warrant such a label... that honor goes to Ben Affleck's dark, twisted, and unforgiving portrayal of Batman.

Speaking of, Batman is undoubtedly the single biggest reason to see this movie. After three solid films by Christopher Nolan which depicted a semi-dark but overall heroic (and dare I say, unintimidating) version of the dark knight, Zack Snyder's take on the caped crusader gives us an interesting portrayal the likes of which we've never really seen before, borrowing heavily from Frank Miller's seminal graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. This Batman is an old and broken man, bitterly stubborn and Hell-bent on bringing down Superman, no matter what the cost. And I DO mean that in the most drastic of terms, for it seems that Batman's 20-year reign of terror has left him indifferent to the lives of criminals; at one point in the film during an exciting chase scene, for instance, we see the Batmobile snag a car holding some thugs and use it to dispatch a second car, no doubt killing virtually everyone inside of both vehicles in the process. But unlike in Tim Burton's duology, Christopher Nolan's films, and even Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" (wherein we see Batman remorselessly kill three thugs, a buttload of ninjas, The Joker, The Penguin, Two-Face (twice), Ra's Al Ghul, AND Talia Al Ghul), this time around we're given a look at Bruce's psychology as well as some clues to give us an idea of why this version of Batman is so cruel and harsh towards criminals. It's... honestly surprising that people give this film such a hard time about Batman's ""killing spree"" when this is absolutely NOT breaking any new ground with him. But hey, could be worse; he could be making out with Black Canary while some criminals burn to death nearby. *Cough*(All-Star Batman)*Cough*

Now that I've covered both of the main stars, I'd like to briefly cover the titular fight which everyone paid to see. Put simply, it's a satisfyingly brutal bout between two titans of the genre that have never shared the screen before. Batman's mechanical armor from The Dark Knight Returns is beautifully recreated in live action, and I'm glad to say that it was largely a practical effect rather than a CGI costume (ala Iron Man) and as a result, it feels appropriately bulky, intimidating, and powerful. I WAS somewhat disappointed that it didn't grant Batman any enhanced strength, merely serving instead as a means by which Batman may take the brunt of Superman's strength without harm, but at the very least it serves its purpose very well. Both characters give it their all, and without spoiling how the fight actually ends it stands as the emotional peak of the movie. (Yes, fanboys, I liked how the fight ended... for a detailed analysis as to why, and with no restraint on spoilers, I refer you to CinemaWins' spectacular video ""Everything Great About Batman Vs Superman"") This summarizes my major plus-points about the overall experience.

I do, however, take issue with the climax of the film. That is not to say that it doesn't deliver exactly what it sets out to; it IS explosive and action-packed, with appropriately epic visuals and a suitably intimidating and powerful villain, but honestly after the spectacular fight between Batman and Superman (which I was far more invested in) the final battle simply bored me. It DOES end on a surprising note, however, which I shan't spoil here (although anybody who's familiar with the source material this film was based on might be able to wager a reasonable guess). Plus we finally got to see Wonder Woman in action for the first time ever in a major big-screen motion picture, so there's also that plus. Believe it or not, I'm one of those few people who is just fine with Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor; I mean he's not the calm and collected mastermind we saw in the Superman and Justice League animated series, but I liked him well enough. At the very least his plan was deeply complicated, he seemed to have contingencies for just about everything, AND he has some of the best lines in the film. So it's a mixed bag; either you love him or you hate him.

Overall I give this movie a 4 out of 5. Too many people have forgotten just how lucky we are to even have this thing; 10 years ago it would never have even been conceivable, yet now because of Marvel's super happy fun time superhero movies (which I should mention I am also quite fond of) we've become spoiled and ungrateful for what we have. This film attempts to be different than Marvel's straightforward super-fare by offering a thought-provoking analysis of Superman and what it would really be like to have such a powerful being in our modern world of cynicism and distrust, and the fans took one look at it and went ""why can't it be all fun and happy like Marvel's doing??"" and refused to appreciate the movie's good points, of which there are many. To me, this film stands not only as an outstanding Batman/Superman movie as well as a monolith of just how far we've come in the medium of superhero movies as a whole. Thank you, Zack Snyder, for this monumental achievement. I'm proud to own your imperfect masterpiece here on Amazon.",1479600000,61,6529,4.7939609236234455

7699831,2,B01D64VSYI,"Minor spoilers

They have been trying to make a Batman/Superman movie for about 15 years and THIS is what they came up with? Worse, this is the ""extended edition"" which was billed as a completely different and improved movie. Zach Snyder's true vision for the film. It's completely garbage. Worse than the theatrical version of the movie.

Movie is 3 hours long and the only noticeable edition to the film is a useless subplot about Clark Kent investigating Batman's capture of a criminal at the beginning of the movie. It all leads to nothing. Clark is bad at Batman and wants to fight him, but then they are bros later so don't worry about it. Batman also kills a lot of people in this movie....and it doesn't seem to be a big deal. He doesn't really seem to care at this point yet we are supposed to be rooting for him as being more responsible than Superman, who refuses to kill people

For a movie that is entirely being sold on a fight (Batman VS Superman) the fight is a completely letdown. In a 3 hour movie they only fight for 6 minutes. Lame.

The entire story of the Batman and Superman (and Wonder Woman who pops up for about 5 minutes spread throughout the movie) meeting for the first time is wasted as a movie and instead one big infomercial for the next 5 or 6 DC superhero movies. A lost opportunity.",1479340800,,1317,4.407407407407407
7699832,4,B01D64VSYI,"A much clearer and more cohesive story than the theatrical version.  The thirty or so minutes added to the film make a big difference in explaining some character motivations and plot points that were hard to understand the first time around.

Overall, an entertaining movie and I would recommend that anyone who has not seen any version yet to start with the extended cut, if you can handle the three-hour run time.",1479254400,,532,4.760869565217392

There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  This Lex Luthor is the weakest villain of all time...just incredibly bland and flat.  The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.  That's unforgiveable considering how many actors have now played Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent.  If either of them show up in some other form or fashion I would beg Hollywood to stop any and all references to their past.  It's becoming a xerox of a xerox.",1478995200,,1067,4.702702702702703

7699869,4,B01D64VSYI,"This may be the most decisive superhero movie ever. For what it's worth, I liked it. I was artistic and deep, similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey (my favorite movie ever). However, like 2001, I have a hard time recommending Batman v Superman to the average movie-watcher. It is long and requires you to draw your own meaning instead of giving it to you. In an age of popcorn movies, Batman v Superman takes itself VERY seriously. Furthermore, I wouldn't let a young child watch this movie.

I prefer this version to the theatrical release. It is much more violent and adds some key scenes with Lois Lane. It also adds some foreshadowing for the Justice League movie and a few key lines of dialogue. However, it's still the same movie. I would have given the theatrical release 4 stars as well. But if you loved the theatrical release, you can't not watch this version. If you disliked the theatrical release (which I can't blame you for) then you will also dislike this movie.

7699906,4,B01D64VSYI,"The main problem with Dawn of Justice is the other part of the title which I actively and intentionally refuse to acknowledge except to say this almost every time I write or speak about this film to emphasize and underscore this main problem.  It relied very unnecessarily on what I strongly believe was an executive decision by Warner Brothers to put this ridiculous ""fight"" in the movie to appeal to a certain segment of the movie-going audience when it simply was not necessary.

The film is a good film.  It is not great in the sense Marvel's ""Avengers"" was great and part of the reason it was not is because Marvel was first and also because of the again ""stupid"" other half of the title.  I have both the movie and the extended cut and each time I watch it it is better and better.

My feeling is Zack Snyder unlike Bryan Singer simply doesn't know how to appreciate the super-hero comic book genre properly although it seems he is willing to learn. (So, it would seem, is Bryan Singer).

The best things in the film are the appearance of Wonder Woman and her being the Wonder Woman I first thought she was when I was a kid.  That is a woman who was every bit Superman's peer (though, not his equal).  I also liked Ben Affleck's Batman.  (Christian Bale's Batman was the best until now and Affleck is one of the two best things that have happened to the DCEU, Geoff Johns is the other).

The worst things about the movie are Jessie Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and the notion to have Lex Luthor portrayed as a psychotic rich kid (Joker-lite) instead of the cold, calculating super -genius which he his character is supposed to be.  Another thing was the killing of Jimmy Olsen.  What did this accomplish aside from upsetting those of us who like the Superman and his supporting cast?  (I am a very vocal critic of this stupid idea to kill super heroes or members of their entourage. It serves no real purpose).

Another of the worst things about this picture which keep it from the five stars was the introduction of Doomsday.  This is a nemesis who can, at times handle the entire Justice League and they threw him into the DCEU right out of the gate?  And also killed him right away too. Very bad idea!

Recently, Joss Whedon was ask to comment on the differences he saw between the MCU and DCEU (which is an unfair question since we have only seen one offering from the DCEU in contrast to the 14 and counting from the MCU) but he said in short that is was storying telling contrasted to style.  My opinion is that story will trump style every time, except when it is the ""first"" film. I am thinking of the first Avatar film which introduced some more sophisticated CGI than had been available at that point and was release in a stunning 3-D format but the story was very typical.

To reiterate, this film again, was a very good film which could easily have been better if the ""suits"" had stuck to the original idea of making a film that would introduce the world to The Justice League.  I have some other criticisms as a well but these won't take a way from the four stars I gave it.  Excelsior!",1478736000,,3099,4.420774647887324

7699987,1,B01D64VSYI,"This is a contrived and desperate film.  The desperation comes from Warner Brothers WANTING to set up a tent pole for a series, but this is a weak attempt at best.  With decades of material that could be sourced for the main characters, all authenticity is tossed out the window in the name of 'grit'.  Its a gritty entry into the superhero drama, devoid of light and hope, and the goodness the heroic characters are supposed to embody.  Director Zach Snyder is hopelessly chasing Christopher Nolan's vision from Dark Knight, where he could have tried to better portray what in comics is known as World's Finest.

The worst part of this experience was Lex Luthor, played by Jessie Eisenberg.  Beyond bad casting, the character is an underdeveloped knock off of Nolan's Joker.  There is nothing sinister about him.  He is a cackling fool in place of an arch villain.

This movie failed. Zach Snyder failed. And some silly execs at Warner Brothers doubly failed... And yet... There is the tent pole.  Everyone can except more of this half thought out desperate schlock for years to come.

Henry Cavill remains my favorite Superman.  Amy Adams is my favorite Lois Lane.  Though I was initially skeptical of Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman; he was great.  The new Batman is as hard as nails and takes no prisoners.

Gal Gadot's introduction as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman was a complete success.  She was a showstopper.  I didn't think that they could ever find an actress to match the beauty of Lynda Carter (the woman that portrayed Wonder Woman in the 1970s television show), but somehow there was another woman of such beauty in existence.  Not only did Gadot look stunning, but her acting was superb.  Her beauty did not soften her up at all.  Diana Prince has plenty of attitude and Wonder Woman is a fearless warrior (and she apparently really enjoys a good fight).  She literally stole the show in every scene that she was in.

I really enjoyed the adult take on the lives of these characters.  The tone was introspective, but there was plenty of action.  I loved it.",1477699200,,1128,4.649746192893401

7700041,5,B01D64VSYI,"I have no idea why this film was panned by the critics.
It's among the best of the genre, bar none. Realistic, gritty and captures the full flavour of current media manipulation.
Clark Kent is a real 3-dimensional person, as is Bruce Wayne. No comic-book flatness or that despicable ""Super Hero"" persona at all. Notice too the major difference between Superman and Batman and all the others. That is: Bruce and all other super-heroes have to put on their character's costumes. But Superman must put on the Clark Kent costume.

What can be said of Wonder Woman?
Gal Gadot is spot on the money. Perfect.
Can't wait for the feature release!

7700073,2,B01D64VSYI,"I don't usually write reviews....So first off let me say that I am a huge DC Super Heroes fan and always have been...Loved the Nolan Batman films and like Man Of Steel..That it was a great film..

However I cannot give this film a thumbs up at all because it was bad...very bad...I believe it was for the most part due to a combination of poor editing (very poor editing) and bad acting from Ben Affleck. He did not portray Batman as he should be...Batman is a guy who has a tortured soul and was driven to partial insanity from witnessing his parents being murdered. He is kind of like Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde...Only he puts on a costume instead of drinking a potion to transform...He even changes his voice and they way he walks when in costume ..crouches like an animal...becomes almost emotionless and very hostile..At least this is the way he was portrayed in the comics as well as by Nolan and Bale in the Dark Knight series.

When Affleck plays Batman he is just a pissed off Kung Fu master in a Bat suit...even using a voice synthesizer...He never portrays a man with an alter ego...and Batman would NEVER be the one who would form a team of heroes or ask help from anyone...(he might help if asked) ..Again at least that is the way he was always portrayed in the comics...

I hope the JLA movie is better ...but judging from the previews it does not look so good...

As far as the editing goes it was awful and made the movie hard to watch jumping from scene to scene....",1477267200,,1477,4.36

Pros : Ben played Batman as good as Christian Bale IMO, The Batmobile was well done and looks amazing, solid story, good character devolpment, Superman was well played, Laurence Fishburne is in it, which I love, Alfred was well casted and to my suprise this movie is awesome!

The Marvel avenger movies strayed too far away from the source material and intentionally created a Movie Universe which kinda sucks even though the movies are great to watch...ONCE OR TWICE! Was Batman Vs Superman perfect?..No, but just sit back and enjoy the ride because we needed an alternative view of these stories...especially if the writers/directors/producers were incredibly loyal to the source material. This film was different from all of the other comic book flicks yet utterly respectful and loyal to the comic book stories. This film is a great companion to Man of Steel.
  This movie and Deadpool were the best of the year of comic book movies; HANDS DOWN. I don't know how the DC film guys could do better then this.",1477180800,2,830,4.7972027972027975

7700090,2,B01D64VSYI,"Movie: The movie is alright though not quite the Batman and Superman movie you would expect from the title as it deals more with the morals and psychology of a aging weathered Bruce Wayne (Heavily inspired by the Batman:Dark Knight Returns version) feeling he most destroy the new hero Superman (Based of the Superman: Earth-One continuity) to ensure that mankind would never be at risk if he ever tried to destroy humanity like Zod and his forces. The flicks is great and if you love the Nolan movies functions as a spiritual successor. But does lack actually superhero action and often has areas where the movie is too quiet and dull. As for the actual Superman and Batman fight.... it's a let down plain and simple. Being directed by Zack Snyder this was an unpleasant surprise as the man knows how to get amazing visuals and did amazing work with the battles in the movies prequel Man of Steel. Though the final battle is exceptional and quite emotional satisfying aside from the fact that Superman feels like just garnish in it with Wonder Woman taking on the bulk of the Doomsday battle and Batman being Lex Luthor's nemesis.

product: standard Blu-ray, packaging lovely cover, you get three disc a a Ultimate Edition Blu-ray, Theatrical Blu-ray, and Theatrical again on DVD. This is where the complaints must begin as why give me a theatrical DVD when paying for the ultimate would not a Ultimate Edition DVD make a little more sense. Also surprised to find the movie does not have a Spanish audio option feature this is crazy in 2016.

7700096,3,B01D64VSYI,"Not Bad. Still nothing compared to Superman the Movie with Christopher Reeve. All the Superman movies since Christopher Reeve have lost the element of humor in it being too dull and dark. How 'bout a little levity once in a while. Also, maybe find someone who has a little personality like Christopher Reeve had and not just another cloned meathead. Jesse Einsenberg was over the top as a wimpy, sniveling Lex Luther.  Michael Bannon (who played General Zod in Man of Steel would have made a much better Lex Luthor being by far the most interesting character in that movie)  Gene Hackman aced the role as Lex Luthor, IMO.. He was both evil and humorous in the role. The movie was a little hard to follow at times too. Seemed to be all over the place but I will not divulge any spoilers here. Overall all it was better than I expected after all the terrible reviews and with having Ben A**lick in it.

I won't bother to provide some detailed review of all the problems.  Again, there are plenty of detailed critiques already out there.  I would just say that, ultimately, its really just not very engaging.  I just could not find myself caring very much about Superman's internal struggles or Batman's quest for vengeance.

7700127,5,B01D64VSYI,"Ignore the critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie is awesome. I hesitated watching it for so long, but I'm glad I did. With an extra 30 minutes or so of content not found in the theatrical release, the director's cut is excellent. This really captures a lot of the feel of the (unofficial) source material found in Frank Miller's ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" series from 1986. I almost wish they'd just made an adaptation of that series, but I understand for Justice League reasons, they needed to change it up.

The major complaints about this movie are from people who are upset that Batman is a bit less squeaky clean in this. There's no sanitized homogenized violence where bad guys are ""knocked out for the authorities"" to pick up. Bad guys get blown up, crushed, incinerated, or shot. The ones who do walk away from the encounter with this Batman will likely pursue another career path as they are in no condition to continue their life of crime. Batman is vengeful, unforgiving, and brutal. He's much closer to his counterpart in the Frank Miller books than he is to Christian Bale's (also excellent) version. His fighting style feels more compact and explosive compared to Bale. Bale seemed to have a more grand, flowing fight style where this one makes you cringe when you see the effects of a fight with the dark knight. You can almost feel the impact of faces on the floor and bones being broken. It's intense.

Superman is shown as a flawed character in the movie. He's not the all-powerful being everyone thought him to be. Superman is ""just a guy trying to do the right thing"". It works.

Wonder Woman is amazing for the brief time you get to see her. As a supporting character she works well and the movie highlights just how powerful she is - something I think a lot of people who don't regularly read comics will be surprised by. She is not a second-string superhero by any stretch of the imagination. She's a confident powerhouse who can definitely hold her own with the two titans of DC comics.

If you watched the theatrical version and hated it, this may not make you change your mind. If you saw it and you thought ""It was okay"", this may improve your opinion of the movie. If you have never seen the movie and enjoy superhero movies like the recent Marvel movies and don't mind something a bit darker, this will definitely entertain you. I consider it a little closer to The Watchmen than The Avengers.

PS - I was wrong about Affleck as Batman. When I heard he was going to be Batman I cringed a bit as I just couldn't picture it.  Then I remembered thinking the same thing about Heath Ledger being cast as the joker in the previous Batman trilogy. I am happy to report I was wrong both times. :)",1476921600,2,2732,4.520242914979757

Snyder may be a shade or two dark for Superman, but Affleck's Batman is terrific and Gal Gadot will leave you wanting more of Wonder Woman.  Is it perfect?  No.  Jesse Eisenberg is a little twitchy for my taste as Luthor, Cavill's Superman never really seems to be comfortable in his own skin, and the president hits the nuclear button WAY too fast for my suspension of disbelief.  The tone is dark, as was Man of Steel's.

7700168,2,B01D64VSYI,"In light of the destruction caused by Zod and Superman's battle at the end of Man of Steel, humanity is divided on Superman's role. He's acting as a one-man savior for which many people are grateful and treat him almost like God. Other people think he's crossed the line into enforcing whatever sort of justice he likes. That makes Superman a vigilante. Those people include a powerful senator (Holly Hunter), Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), and Bruce Wayne (Batman, er...Ben Affleck).

Batman has had his own history of vigilante justice and now after twenty years, he's a bit grumpy and sadistic. He brands criminals with a bat symbol. He uses guns quite liberally (this is a pet peeve of mine--classically he doesn't use guns because his parents were killed by a gun and the limitation makes him a more interesting character). Wayne Financial lost a building and many people in the Superman/Zod battle. Batman blames Superman and is now working to take care of the problem, i.e. develop something to contain or kill Superman.

Lex Luthor has his own mistrust of Superman and is more interested in discrediting him than in killing him (though that would be okay too). He has various schemes, some more plausible than others. Lex is fairly young and inexperienced, making his character more awkward and bratty than clever and menacing. The portrayal is interesting but not satisfying. Maybe he'll grow into a proper villain in future films.

Superman himself is trying to sort out his role in the world. His number one concern is Lois Lane, of that he is certain. He strives to save people when he can but he recognizes his limits. Even Superman can pay attention to only a few things at a time. He wants to stop the vigilante Batman. Which is a little weird, given Batman has been around for twenty years and Gotham is just across the bay from Metropolis (Lex can see the Bat-signal from the roof of his building!).

The movie has a lot of ideas floating around which shows potential. But none of them are developed in any depth or interesting ways, like viewers are at a fantastic buffet but aren't allowed to sample any items. After a while, I just accepted that any big ideas wouldn't get anywhere.

The other big problem was the movie taking itself far too seriously. The score has some painful moments of melodramatic corniness that made me laugh out loud when I should have been nodding my head and stroking my beard. Some minor plots made very little sense. The big moment of reconciliation between Batman and Superman was awkward and unconvincing. A little more levity would go a long way for the film.

On the other hand, the fight scenes were pretty good. The big battle at the end when Wonder Woman finally shows up was exciting and fun, even if Batman's main fighting tactic was strategically running away. He used his brains as much as his brawns. Ben Affleck was good as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, at least the equal of Christian Bale's performance. This movie isn't as good as the Nolan films but Affleck has a good future in front of him with the role.

At the end of the movie, Bruce Wayne says, ""We can do better. We will. We have to."" Bruce was talking about humanity in general and the meta-humans in particular (the movie has little teasers of Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg shoehorned in), but I hope Ben was making a promise to the audience. They definitely do need to do better.",1476662400,,3404,4.672787979966611

7700172,3,B01D64VSYI,"It seems like there is the spirit of a very good movie trapped in this rather poor one. Parts of this movie are great, or look like they could be great if we could see more of them. I think Henry Cavill is superb as Superman and Amy Adams is great as Lois Lane. In fact everything about the Superman part of the story is very good, though it doesn't get enough screen time. I also like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and would love to have seen more of her, but she's hardly a part of the story until the final battle scene. The problem with this movie, it seems to me, is Batman. He has more screen time than anyone else, and he is by far the worst part of the movie. The movie seems to be trying to say something important about manipulation and distrust and alienation with the whole Batman hates Superman thing (as well as with the whole ""everybody hates Superman except when they need him to save them"" thing), but it just didn't work for me. It seemed to me like Batman was just jealous because Superman has a bigger...um...superpower. Batman was my first hero, and the real Batman would never be such a small-minded jerk. Batman as a jealous, abusive, reactionary, self important twit who goes around torturing bad guys just does not work on any level at all. He is not a hero. I don't know if a different actor could have sold it better, and maybe made the whole movie work better? I thought Affleck was pretty bad, though his part is a thankless one so maybe it was the part that was bad. I think by choosing to make Batman a reactionary vigilante with no self awareness or personal insight, the movie ruined what it was trying to do with the Superman as perceived by the press and public, and how perspectives are manipulated.
Also, the pacing is odd. This is quite a long movie, and it feels fairly choppy and disjointed. I've read that the extended version is much better, which leads me to wonder why the theatrical release is edited the way it is.
Still, there's the beginnings of some good ideas here, and some very fine actors amongst all the mess, so it's worth a view for a few dollars to rent it. I would not buy it.",1476576000,,2130,4.314214463840399

Batman V Superman was the first movie I purchased to test out the new setup. Was really underwhelmed by the picture quality. Some of the Netflix 4k looks better to me, and even playing some Bluray films (John Carter, Zootopia - 2 great Bluray transfers) on the same player (upscaling) looked better to me. I spent all weekend messing around with different settings (trying options from different AV forum blogs)...couldn't get this 4K bluray to look as good as these other films using the same exact setup....Not sure if it's the darkness of the film or what, but I'm definitely disappointed in the overall PQ. Movie itself is ok...also a 3 star. 3 stars for PQ and 3 for the movie as well. I really hope all the 4k content doesn't have this lackluster performance or I'm going to feel really bad about this investment in the future...:/

UPDATE I hooked up my older Samsung 64"" 1080p Plasma and played the regular bluray that comes with this set in my PS4 - SIDE BY SIDE while my new Sony 940D had the 4K bluray playing and couldn't believe that the BLURAY AND PS4 with STANDARD BLURAY had slightly better picture quality. Colors seemed more natural (Despite trying to edit settings on the Sony 940D to match for over 2 hours), the Samsung still looked better no matter what I did. Anyone else have similar results???

This film is much better the second time around, in my opinion. I liked it the first time, but thought it was a bit of a hot mess. After a second viewing, pieces and progressions in the story made more sense and it was an overall more enjoyable experience.

I, like many others, thought Jesse Eisenberg's performance was a little over the top and also a little misguided. It seemed to me, he was doing more of a Riddler interpretation than Lex Luthor. But after reading some reviews and reflecting on the performance, it became clear he was trying to do a modern version of Luther, which, can obviously be subject to different portrayals than the original because we haven't really seen what a modern Lex Luthor can be.

Overall, I thought Eisenberg's performance didn't ruin the film, like many thought, but I still don't think it inspired any fear for the villain.

I personally enjoyed the dark tone of the film and thought the dream scene with Batman in the desert was a highlight. I definitely recommend seeing this film again if you've seen it only once before.",1476057600,10,1154,4.669950738916256

  The plot parallels that of Marvel's Captain America: Civil War so that should indicate that it is a recycled plot used in many of the modern day superhero action adventure movies. Jessie Esenberg did a horrible job as Lex Luthor. He undermines Lex as a crazy loon who can mastermind lethal plots but is not displaying a usual smart intellect and charm that Luthor is known for. Lex Luthor is Superman's Joker. The way Essernberg plays Luthor leaves audience scratching their heads while pondering how this flick had the potential to be much more than it actually was. Wonder Woman is very alluring and mysterious so that's a plus for any viewers out there. The Extended Cut adds 24-30 minutes of footage that clears up central motivations of characters absent in the blocky and choppy theatrical cut. This version is rated r though, mainly for a shot of Afrleck nude with his rear showing and a brief sequence of blood splattering on warehouse walls in a batman action sequence. For any superhero fans out there who want to see this movie but never decided to until now, you absolutely MUST watch the extended cut of the feature for the best viewing experience and understanding possible. 3/5 stars",1475971200,3,1338,4.8384279475982535

7700286,5,B01D64VSYI,"I've been an Amazon member for 8 years, but this is the first time I've actually reviewed something, so bear with me.

I'd like to start off by saying that I heard a lot of bad things about this movie, and it took me until a few days ago to actually watch it because of that. Even with Affleck's fiasco of a movie in Daredevil, I was extremely excited to see him play Batman. After all, Daredevil was years ago, and Affleck has had a lot of time to reflect and grow from that. Suffice it to say, I was happy with his performance in this movie. I think he made a wonderful Bruce Wayne.

The artistry of the movie was phenomenal. I will say, I can understand the bad vibe it got, as seeing it for the first time, the first hour of the movie feels very disjointed, with scenes breaking in seemingly at odd points. I especially could understand this for people who saw the theatrical edition. I myself haven't seen that, but considering how much time was added on to the Ultimate Edition, it's easy to imagine that a lot of good plot and explanation was left out. Regardless, this version of the movie delivers, and the way all of those disjointed scenes were tied together by the end was fantastic. Not to mention this movie has a lot of humanity in the stories it tells. The characters actually feel more than two-dimensional, and this really allows you to empathize with them.

Side note, I am so looking forward to the Wonder Woman movie, as Gal Gadot played a wonderful Diane. And surprisingly, Jesse Eisenberg actually played a fun Lex Luthor - in my opinion. A different Lex than what we're used to, but fun nonetheless.

As always, there is room for improvement, but this actually is one of my favorite superhero movies of late. Part of that is because I personally am a huge DC fan, and the atmosphere they create in their universe is much more appealing to me than the candy-coated lightness of Marvel movies.

It seems they were trying to reach for more than they could handle at times, with trying to introduce every member of the Justice League for the upcoming movies. I was also a little peeved at Doomsday. Origin is completely screwed and design was pretty bad. But, you can't have it all. Still, the overall plot of the movie was good, and though it was ambitious to start off with Batman v Superman, I think the relationship between Cavill's Clark Kent and Affleck's Bruce Wayne will be much more satisfying moving forward, having seen them start with this conflict.

Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I'm going to have to watch it again before I have a lot of depth to my review, but I'll update when I do. And trust me, this is a movie that I will be watching again very soon. I almost started it over when I was finished...but it was about 3 am, and I needed sleep.",1475971200,5,2782,4.413255360623782

7700312,5,B01D64VSYI,"This is a more preferable movie. DC has been bashed by the critics for too long now. Man of Steel sat well with the critics but this movie and Suicide Squad did not. I honestly love all 3 of the movies from the DCEU so far and I don't care about what the critics say. Now the thetrical cut I already loved so this extended edition gave me more of what I liked! But just like other fans out there in some parts
(mostly the Knightmare scene) I felt a little bit confused. That was because there was 3 hours of this movie filmed and in theatres WB was too scared to release a 3 hour movie so they took off 30 minutes of it and made it 2 hours and 30 minutes. That isn't the appropriate amount of time to tell a story like this. So this extended edition helped me understand those scenes better. Another problem with both cuts are they tried to clash a lot into one movie. And the way they set up Aquaman was not good. Also keep in mind this plays as a Man of Steel 2 so it had to be a sequel,a set up,and introduction film. But the extended cut didn't fix Jessie Eisenburgs horrible performance as Lex Luthor II.Now that we got the negatives out of the way lets now focus on how good this cut of the movie really was. Now this gives us an even extended period of time with Clark Kent unlike in the theatrical cut we didn't get to see him too much. We also get to see who Jena Malone played and she played a forensic at the GCPD.In addition to that Stepphenwolf the villan of next years justice league film is here. The opening africa scene in the theatrical cut didn't make sense since they blamed superman for the events that happened there. When I was in the theatre I thought last time I checked Superman doesnt use machine guns or explosives. So in the extended cut what really happened is the terrorists burnded the bodies to make it look like Superman used his lazer vision.
The Knightmare scene is extended and now explained. So that robot that knocked batman out was actually cyborgs alternate costume. And the symbol carved in the sand is the symbol of a famous justice league villan darkeside. This could mean in the later years of the DCEU we could get an Injustice movie. Of course not right now since they still need to realease the forthcoming Justice League Trilogy. One of the deleted scenes featured the guy who got branded by batman in the beggining comes back and gets killed in prison. A few guest appearences in the movie that got cut out is one from Jon Stewart and Neil Degrey Tyson. Now my favorite part about the extended cut is the extended warehouse fight scene. Now lets talk about the battle. Now it is extended by very little but its what you paid for isn't it?Now this extended cut is rated R for no reason to me. Sure in the africa scene they added two sprays of bloodsplatter may have been added but nothing you haven't seen in a pg-13 movie. And only one f-bomb. PG-13 movies are aloud to have only one fbomb if they have 2 then it becomes rated r. A middle finger doesnt do anything either. And though batmans butt may have been shown remember Xmen days of future past when they showed wolverines butt. Its like the same thing. None of the violence equals to an r rating. Zack Snyder even admittied to rating this r personally because he wanted to just show off. Overall I give this a 10/10",1475798400,5,3322,4.299840510366826

It was hard to take his side because you feel no bond with the character. And that whole Doomsday situation was ridiculous. He was not supposed to be created from Zod's DNA, let alone be manipulated and orchestrated by Lex Luther. Made no sense. Why don't they just stick to the comic books?

7700328,4,B01D64VSYI,"Well, I get that this film panned by a lot of folks...  but I suspect that much of that comes down to the ""Coke versus Pepsi"" style argument, where ""if it's not Marvel, it sucks.""

I should point out that I've been a comic reader for many years...  though I finally bailed on DC when they did their most recent ""reboot"" (""The New 52"").  I haven't bought any in quite a few years now, and had pared down to almost nothing before that.  So, my knowledge of ""current comics"" may be a bit sparse, but of historical comics (from the 1960s through the early 2000's) is fairly complete.  The only stuff I've been following in recent times has been Robert Kirkland's ""Walking Dead"" series.

So...  let's just say, I didn't have the expectations that some folks did when going into these films (Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice).  I was VERY pleased with ""Man of Steel"" (which I consider to be a 9/10 rating, with the main issues being the terrible ""Pa Kent"" bit which failed to ruin the film but did taint it a bit).

I'd heard that folks didn't like this film, in advance...  and to be fair, my wife tells me she hated it, so I get where these are coming from.  :)

But...  to me, this was a pretty good film, overall... though I've marked it down a star for being TERRIBLY derivative... in the sense that ""they borrowed scenes, intact, from a series of other stories.""

To anyone who knows the story of ""The Dark Knight Returns""...  much of this story is lifted, DIRECTLY, from that.  (There's an animated film version of that story now, so you can go watch that, and compare... and see how much of this is taken from that.)  And, of course, more of it is lifted from the classic ""The Death of Superman"" story arc, as well, which many of us will remember.  More still is taken from one of the more modern retellings of how the Justice League was formed.  And we get a healthy dollop of Apocalypse (not the biblical concept, but the extradimensional world ruled by Darkseid and opposed by Jack Kirby's ""New Gods""), complete with Darkseid's ""Parademons"" being shown on-screen, and Darkseid's ""Omega"" symbol on the scorched Earth.

So...  what the makers of this film tried to do was lift some of the best, most beloved, story elements from many sources and blend them into a single, coherent storyline.

And... they actually do a pretty decent job of it.  I'm marking it down for them trying to do that in the first place, but giving them credit for doing something that they shouldn't have done, but doing it in the best way possible.

The REALLY GOOD in this film...

All of the main ""superhero"" characters are very well portrayed.  I was worried about Affleck, but he did a fine job here.  Plus, we get glimpses of other superhero characters who we, no doubt, will see a lot more of later (Cyborg, Aquaman, The Flash, and even, it's hinted at, the Martian Manhunter).  We didn't see any hint of Green Lantern...  mainly because after the mistakes made in the GL movie a few years ago, they're no doubt planning how to fix that without violating the principle tenets of the character.  No doubt that we'll see him, in some form, in the next film in the series.

And the bits ""borrowed"" from other works...  are ""well-borrowed"" and are, on their own individual merits, quite good.

The ""OK""...

The portrayal of Doomsday wasn't quite up to snuff.  It was just another ""Deus Ex Machina"" here...  reasonably well-done but Doomsday should have warranted an entire movie all to itself.  Making Doomsday a ""reanimated zombie of General Zod"" felt a bit... weird...  but I could live with that.

Amy Adams' Lois Lane remains... OK.  But she's still pretty bland.  I prefer the Lois we got in Smallville over all others we've seen to date.  Lois needs more attitude, but needs to seem utterly competent.  And please, no more ""Teri Hatcher"" versions...  nice as she may have been to look at.

And... the BAD...

Yes, the story is too derivative, as stated before.  That's the biggest issue I have with this film, by far.

AND...

The Lex Luthor character in this film wasn't good.  I get it...  they wanted to make this ""relevant to today"" by giving us a ""founder of facebook"" character rather than the classic ""mad scientist"" or the more recent ""business tycoon"" versions we've had before.  The problem is, this particular version of Lex simply seemed WEAK, and ILL DEFINED.

Again, Lex really needed a film all to himself, or perhaps multiple films, in order to get to the point we're left at in this film... and we've never had that with this particular Lex, so none of what he does in this film has any real weight to it.

Oh... and my final quibble...  BATMAN DOES NOT USE GUNS.  It's not that he's morally incapable of it...  he's PSYCHOLOGICALLY INCAPABLE OF IT, as in ""guns horrify and disgust him.""  Now, you could argue that (as was done in ""The Dark Knight Returns"") he has no issue with RUBBER bullets...  bruising and otherwise injuring, but not killing, his targets.  But in this case, we see him mowing down opponents with machine guns, with their vehicles exploding (and them OBVIOUSLY being killed).

To be fair... in reality, a figure like ""Batman"" could never operate successfully without killing.  (Which is why, in reality, a figure like ""Batman"" should never exist!)  And perhaps the filmmakers wanted to put this more firmly into the real world?  But this is such a HUGE deviation from the Batman of the comics that it's just beyond accepting that this is the same character.

(FYI, this was an issue with the Tim Burton Batman films of decades past, as well... but something that the Nolan films got right!  Batman will put you into the intensive care ward, but he doesn't kill.)",1475712000,,5687,4.587475149105368

7700333,5,B01D64VSYI,"Upon my first viewing, I thought this movie was ""good enough"".  Just having watched it a second time, I found it MUCH better.  In fact, it is probably the best superhero movie made so far.  But, be warned:  this one is very heavy unlike almost all of the rather lighter Marvel Comics fare, so if simple adventure is your thing, this may not be for you.

I'll forego the synopsis as the title says it all.  What surprised me was the absolute dark nature of the story. Despite pointless comparisons to the Christopher Nolan Batman films, Affleck does a great job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne derived directly from Frank Miller's ""the Dark Knight Returns"";  they even do a phenomenal job of making the Batman look like he jumped from the pages of that graphic novel, though the way he was depicted in it was never my favorite.  Anyway, Affleck's Batman is an aging, cynical and angry one, disillusioned with a corrupt world and feeling he must accept that, for all his efforts, nothing is better and he will leave behind no legacy.  Cavill is excellent as Superman/Clark Kent once again, but, this time, as opportunistic politicians and the media-incited masses protest his interventions on their behalf, his character starts to doubt himself.  Their enmity towards each other (sparked and fueled by Lex Luthor's manipulations) is motivated by flip sides of the same coin that represent the basic nature of each character:  Superman's because Batman doesn't ""play by the rules"", and Batman's because his cynical nature makes him believe that if Superman CAN destroy the world, he eventually WILL as the inevitable corruption sets in.  This is further expressed by Luthor when he states, ""....if God is all powerful, then he can't be all good.""

Although many have compared the theme of this movie to Marvel's ""Captain America:  Civil War"", here, it goes deeper than the politics, touching on the battle between Man's duel nature, each side represented by the antagonistic heroes (Superman as the light and Batman as the dark).  In the end, the two must co-exist in order to survive.  This film even hints that the battle is representative of our aspirations to the divine vs our human vulnerabilities (Lex at one point describes the impending fight as ""God vs Man"").  This might seem pretty heavy stuff for a comic book story, but comics have been compared to the ancient Greek myths, so maybe it's actually fitting; only symbolism and allegory can do such lofty themes justice.

The editing is relentless and the script tightly written.  Special mention must go to Hans Zimmer's outstanding musical score.  Aptly brooding to match the tone of the film, it soars to apocalyptic heights with, occasionally, a quiet dollop of his ""Man of Steel"" theme as a sad echo of a once hopeful past.  The first time I watched it, I thought that, rather than a movie about both characters, it was more like a Batman movie in which Superman just guest-starred.  The dark nature of the film further highlighted this impression, as Superman seemed rather lost and almost helpless in this grim view of the World.  Upon a second viewing, I realized that, although we see primarily from Bruce Wayne's perspective, everything revolves around Superman, and not just through his actions, but because of his very existence.  And, in the end, it is Superman's final sacrifice that rekindles the dying embers of hope, not only in Bruce Wayne, who finds a new mission, but in the populace as well.

Although the movie was a financial success (though not attaining quite what the makers had hoped), many critics panned it, and legions of fanboys, outraged that it didn't slavishly follow some comic book story line or their limited perceptions of characters who were published long before they were born, trashed the film in a butt-hurt frenzy.  As for the general audience looking for the typical feel-good but ultiimately shallow fare, they enjoyed the spectacle, then shrugged their shoulders and moved on.  I guess nobody expected a movie based off of comic book characters to have this much depth.  Also, it could be a little confusing unless one was very familiar with the characters (for instance, how many general movie goers know that Superman derives his strength from our yellow sun?).  This is sad, as it will probably result in Warner Brothers not taking a risk to attempt anything that doesn't toe the party line when it comes to their comic book franchises.  But, the film stands as a testament to Zack Snyder's talent at bringing his vision successfully to the screen.  Highly recommended, just remember to set your sights above where they normally go for this genre if you want to truly ""get"" it.",1475625600,,4680,4.886075949367089
7700334,2,B01D64VSYI,"So many scenes felt so forced. Cramming Doomsday and Wonder Woman into the movie just didn't seem to blend with the whole Superman/Batman rivalry. The whole Justice League setup was too obvious and in your face, there were no gradual hints it was just ""here they are"" no mystique whatsoever. The Justice League reveal was just plain lazy writing.

The absolute worst part, though, without doubt was Lex Luthor. Putting aside the fact that Jesse Eisenburg was cast(which is incredibly difficult to ignore), Luthor appeared as a neurotic, unhinged stuttering nutjob. The Lex Luthor portrayed in EVERYTHING else is a calculated calm and supremely logical genius.

7700389,5,B01D64VSYI,"While the fanboys and general audience(?) were moaning over...I have no idea what, the rest of us got exactly what we wanted from not just the mythological meeting of Batman vs. Superman, but more of what makes the DC Extended Universe great. Drama. Sci-Fi. Great performances. Real tension. Peril. And complex characters who are deeply flawed or afraid of something in their own way.
As a grad in film production, I can tell you objectively speaking almost nothing is wrong with the conception and execution of this film. Zack Synder and team did an amazing job at honing the dark and grim tone(reminiscent of all the most critically acclaimed and fan-loved comic book stories) while building on the world first established in his earlier film, Man of Steel. The ""dark"" tone that was so heavily criticized, helps elevate the story to the level of real cinema, as opposed to a throwaway happy meal movie like the type being churned out by Marvel. Respectfully, DC and Marvel are geared to two different types of audiences, but this is much more of a film rather than a movie. The approach to the story was to tell a socio-political drama of a God-like being who questions his influence in a world that fears him, and where the consequences of his heroics are real, and very concerning. Bruce Wayne, on the other hand, sees Superman as very much a threat, fearing him much like other men as something that he doesnt understand and is afraid of. Key word being ""afraid."" His actions go on to demonstrate this and make their conflict and poignant one that could even be described as a metaphor for Man's fear of the Unknown, or God, and his wish to destroy that which he doesn't understand out of fear masked as anger. This is great stuff.
Without getting distracted by details, this film rocks and on all levels. It's a thoughtful superhero film that should be applauded for elevating the genre above the formulaic and safe approach of competing Marvel films. So make sure to purchase this and also watch the Ultimate Edition to really appreciate Snyder's gift of fantastic pacing.",1475452800,2,2079,4.761772853185596
7700390,5,B01D64VSYI,Absolutely love the quality of this 4K action movie!!,1475452800,2,53,5.0
7700391,3,B01D64VSYI,"Alright. The reviews for this movie are very accurate and there is a reason why the movie didn't do as good as expected in theaters and why the big name critics scored it lower than what people thought. The movie is good overall and lays down an interesting storyline that sets the pace for DC's Cinematic Universe. However, the one thing that most people complain about is also what I complain about and that is the ""over-stuffing"" of the storyline. I do feel like that they did indeed pack too much into the movie overall, although I can understand that they did it that way to avoid having to explain as much in the future movies. So let's get on with the review.

The movie was highly anticipated for the past year and a half ever since the very first teaser trailer was released. I specifically was very excited for this movie, hence why I watched in theaters. The opening of the movie was excellent and it featured Jeffery Dean Morgan as Bruce's father and Lauren Cohan as his mother. It showed and demonstrated Bruce's fear of bats and so on. Then it switched to Bruce Wayne's perspective as he was there as the ending events of ""Man of Steel"" were occcuring. After seeing the destruction caused by Superman, Bruce from right then and there disliked Superman. However, then after the 1st 10 min. of the movie in then switches to very, very drawn out storyline that is boring and unexciting until the last 45 minutes of the film.

Once it got towards the ending you could really see that boring storyline transform into that brilliant and amazing storyline that we expected, but they brought certain elements from the comics and introduced them way too quickly into the movie. Overall the movie was good, but it did not meet expectations that we all had hoped for and it was more of a drama movie than anything.

I do, however, still recommend that you try this movie for yourselves and also it is still a must watch in case you are interested in watching future movies in DC's Universe. So, I give it 3 stars overall because 1, it didn't meet the standards we all hoped for and 2, it was very drawn out and boring for the 1st hour and a half of the movie. Still this is my sole opinion, and there are others that gave this film 5 stars because they do indeed truly love it. However, as a big Comic Movie fan, this movie wasn't as great as I had hoped for. I hope this helps and thanks for reading.",1475452800,,2404,4.422121896162528
7700392,2,B01D64VSYI,"I held off seeing this film after all the negativity and furor. I'm not a comic book reader so much of the minutiae escapes me, but I'm fairly familiar with the larger ideas. I'm a lifelong Superman fan but the Marvel films have been much more captivating and this movie pretty much proves why. The Avengers started building slowly, through hints peppered through films starting with Iron Man in 2008. The Avengers wasn't released until 2012. In between, Marvel sowed plot threads in the first Captain America film and the first Thor film, with teasers and tidbits in Iron Man 2 and The Hulk. That made The Avengers a denouement, a payoff for everyone who had seen the other films and had seen how the strands came together. With this film, you see how not to do the same thing. Instead of building up the Justice League bit by bit through multiple films, they try to cram the whole thing into one movie by way of a convoluted plot that doesn't work. I did like the beginning, with Bruce's on-the-ground perspective while Sup and Zod throw down, which is not an angle you get to see that often. The effects were well-done and I was ready to believe Ben Affleck as an older, worn-down Bruce Wayne. But this never felt like a single film; it was more like watching disparate scenes that didn't have any connection to each other--each one strong in itself, but not part of a larger cohesive whole. It was as if you had twenty different writers each write a scene and then try to put them together. No cohesive unity, no strong sense of where things were going, and actors clearly struggling to figure out just what they were supposed to be emoting about. Bruce's dream/vision/hallucination of the future was confusing and didn't help the story; there was a wonderful opportunity to really explore the conflicting ideas of Superman being more of a threat and Batman not really representing justice, or even an opportunity for a good quality storyline of Lex Luthor manipulating Batman into attacking and destroying Superman (or did he want Superman to kill Batman? Who knows?). This is a movie full of lost opportunities and ham-handed writing; the dramatic moment when Batman is poised to kill Superman, all it takes is the name ""Martha"" to send Batman into a slo-mo dramatic flashback and make him come to his senses and suddenly ALL of his obsessive suspicions about and vendetta against Superman are gone. So he decides to save Martha Kent while Clark goes off to battle this Luthor/Kryptonian LoTR cave troll thing that Lex managed to make, because apparently it makes sense that he was just given access to Zod and the remnants of a ship and allowed to frolic all by himself to his heart's content and NO ONE noticed. That's hardly the weakest part of this film, but one of the most annoying--we know Lex is the villain, so the writers just have him do openly Villainy things that genius crimefighter Bruce Wayne misses because Superman Vendetta Blinders, I suppose. Oh, and Wonder Woman is in this film, but why, I can't say. Her only purpose seems to be to connect the other soon-to-be Justice League members to this mishmash of a film and hint at things that are coming. Protip, DC writers; you're supposed to do that through teasers at the END of the film, not shove a character into a film to serve no purpose. If this were television, this would be dangerously close to a back door pilot. So in effect, DC watched Marvel for at least four years, saw how they carefully and patiently laid the groundwork for the Avengers, and then decided they didn't want to put that much effort in and tried to do it all in one movie. Badly. The result is this.",1475452800,,3653,4.63020030816641

7700444,5,B01D64VSYI,"I really enjoyed this movie & I'm not shocked one bit by all the hate its been getting as Snyder's films have always been met with divisive criticism. But you've got to give it to Warner Bros. & Snyder for being gutsy & making a film with its own direction, & tone. BvS is clearly not trying to ride the coat tails of Marvel Studios. Sure the movies grounded & grim yet beyond the gloom & doom,  BvS still successfully manages to retain that sense of the fantastic & escapism much like Zack Snyder's other movies. It was a brave move to tackle & revisit some themes from both Watchmen & of course MOS when they could've easily gone another route & tried to emulate Captain America or Transformers to please mainstream audiences. The long running time makes sense for a movie of this epic scale & deserves no less. BvS is a visual & cerebral juggernaut that was made for the fans, so I'm totally looking forward to what Zack Snyder's vision will bring to the long awaited live action Justice League films. Another great thing is that the DCEU isn't tying their TV shows with their movies. Despite the herd mentality, not everything needs to be interconnected to succeed. Zack Snyder's latest film is more than a worthy successor to his MOS. While I enjoyed the theatrical cut just fine, this extended cut is the actual movie as envisioned by Snyder & not unlike his ""Watchmen -the ultimate cut"" edition. This is clearly THE version to watch.",1475280000,,1440,4.55984555984556

7700446,2,B01D64VSYI,"The main reason I hated this movie was because of Ben Affleck. He is a horrible Batman and an awful choice to follow Christian Bale in this iconic role. Batman seemed very stupid in this and it made a mockery of everything that is Batman.

I'm not a huge Superman fan to begin with but the way the filmmaker used religious themes to make Superman seem like he was Jesus and the savior of the whole world was irritating. Also, it became so irritating how self righteous Clark Kent was, it was like he was the hall monitor of the world.

The best thing about the movie was the introduction of Wonder Woman. Although, no one will replace the iconic Linda Carter, this version is pretty awesome. Gal Gadot was a great choice for Wonder Woman and she did a great job with her part.

Jessie Eisenberg also did a great job as Lex Luther, he was diabolical and cunning.

The name of the movie is Batman V Superman, but they don't really get into it until towards the end of the movie for a few minutes.  And the battle between them to begin with seemed ridiculous.  Luckily, they figure that out within minutes.  I wasn't quite following what was going on throughout the entire movie.  Didn't realize Jesse Eisenberg was playing Lex Luthor until about half way in when someone said his name.  And it was a nice touch adding Xena to the mix, but unless you know what she's supposed to look like, you won't realize it's her til the end when you see the credits.  Ben Affleck was alright as Batman, but Christian Bale would've been ten times better. This was a good movie, but bathed in plot holes, slow pacing, absurdities.

7700460,5,B01D64VSYI,"Batman V Superman:Dawn of Justice is not a good movie. It is a GREAT movie. It gives a super first step toward building the Justice League in their cinematic universe. Henry Cavill continues the strong performance as Superman that he began in Man of Steel. Superman is presented in the light of what would humans think and how would they act if an alien from another planet came to Earth. No matter how much good he does, Xenophobia persists with many that are,quite frankly,scared of him. Next, Batman is taken in the gritty direction of Frank Miller's classic The Dark Knight Returns series. Ben Affleck gives an amazing performance of an older,more seasoned Bruce Wayne who's become jaded through experience. He takes the character through a progression of fear to understanding, that, for all intents and purposes, is the ""everyman"" view of Superman. Thats definitely the first time Batman is presented in that way. Then we're introduced to Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot gives an amazing,if albeit abbreviated, performance of the Amazon Princess Diana. She exudes all of the sex appeal of a supermodel while being able to battle the main villain to a standstill. She is awesome! Just fyi, Gadot is a former Miss Universe contestant and soldier. How could casting for Wonder Woman be any better? Finally, the Justice League cameos and foreshadowing. Aquaman Arthur Curry, The Flash Barry Allen, and Cyborg Victor Stone make very brief appearances to give us a taste of what's to come with the 2017 Justice League movie. Also on the Ultimate Edition, we're introduced to future villain Steppenwolf,who is the primary antagonist in Justice League. Steppenwolf is the uncle and General of the Army of Apokolips,which many fans will recognize from comics and cartoons as being the planet of Darkseid. The biggest bad guy in the DC Universe and probable cameo appearance in Justice League. Overall, this was an amazing movie with stunning visuals and the first time we get DC's Trinity of, what are arguably, comics most well known charaters.

7700466,2,B01D64VSYI,"I am 60...have been a movie junkie for 50 of those years...and, a DC comics junkie for even longer.
Let me be clear: the theatrical release of Batman v Superman is one of the most depressing, mean-spirited, wrong-headed, incoherent and badly directed films I have ever had to sit through (and, I saw 'Caligula'!). 2.5 hours of badly lit, bad-tempered impostors masquerading as Supes & Bats...dealing with a neurotic, nambi-pambi metro-sexual Luthor. If my kids hadn't forced me to see the brilliant, life-affirming 'Zootopia' the following week, I might still be sitting alone in the dark.

This 'ultimate' version adds back enough narrative connective tissue to make the movie ALMOST make some kind of sense...but, not quite. And, in order to get that content, you have to slog through over 3 hours of Superman-as-Batman, Batman-as-Punisher, Luthor-as-Richard Simmons, Zach Snyder as someone who should get a swift kick in the ass for screwing it up so badly. Oh, to be sure...there are endless 'easter eggs' and 'shout-outs', and other things that are dear to the basement-dwelling, 40-and-still-living-at-home...'fanboys' (ack!). And, that's the sad reality: this 'film' was never made for people looking for things like 'character', or stories that are lucid and flow. It was made for dweebs with the attention span of a gnat...who luv nothing more than to argue over why Superman's costume never rips or burns.

If you enjoyed the theatrical release, you stopped paying attention after the 1st sentence. If you didn't, this version is worth looking at once...if you can get someone else to pay for it.",1475107200,,1606,5.173076923076923

They spent time in the beginning telling the tale of Bruce Wayne's transformation to Batman which wasted a good 15 minutes of story time that would of be better spent providing more information on why he was in Metropolis.  Also they could of done better moving from scene to scene which felt too abrupt between character shifts.  A good movie overall, just not as smooth or fun as ""Avengers"" Marvel movies.",1475107200,,575,4.447619047619048
7700468,1,B01D64VSYI,"You have a three hour movie called batman vs superman. The beginning of this movie is awesome. Its the final battle of Man of Steel, but from the point of view of Bruce Wayne. Bloodshed, horror, and a giant mess. You really understand the motivation of the chracters. Then we have about two hours of talking, no Batman fighting Superman. Mostly just discourse, espionage, and other superheroes being introduced without doing anything. Finally, we have an epic fight scene that lasts under ten minutes, which is resolved in a completely nonsensical way. ""Your mom's name s Martha too!!?? Lets go get fro-yo and be best friends!"" It was clear that the filmmakers didn't know where to go from here, but insisted on another 45 minutes of movie. So they introduced a giant villainous monster to cement the team into place, which we all have fun watching King Kong his way around the city. Superman kind of dies, because even though Wonder Woman could have done the same thing to beat the bad guy without the negative impacts of the Krypton, Superman has to end every movie by being the hero and letting everyone think he's dead for awhile. Lex Luthor ends up in jail, because in this world, killing is justified if the person might hurt you on accident, or when its to protect the greater good, or mostly whenever, but not when you have a criminally insane a-hole that's unleashing infinitely destructive monsters on the city. The whole movie is riddled with plotholes, nonsense. and way too many flashbacks.

Movie got important parts WRONG!!!
WONDERWOMAN: Bracelets were designed to block small items thrown at her (as thick as the bracelet). Yet, she was able to block a huge blast from Doomsday??

BATMAN: Batman is a unique superhero because of his wits. Another important characteristics are that he Never kills bad guys. Never uses a gun (parents were killed by a gun). And he never swears! He is an investigator and bases everything on facts. And, at the end of the movie he explains that he wants to put together a team because he has a ""feeling""????

LEX LUTHOR: Did the guy playing Lex Luthor auditioned for the JOKER part? He got it all wrong. He was acting more like the JOKER. It was very difficult to see him as Lex Luthor at ALL. How can they get the personalities mixed up so badly?

SUPERMAN: He was not too bad. Just that out of all the people in the city who must have died during the fight, he was able to hear Lois Lane?? Really? Anyhow, he tried to stay true to his character.

Doomsday: Doomsday was supposed to have Lex Luthors' DNA? The twist didn't make sense. In addition, doomsday didn't look like Doomsday at all. He was not Doomsday. He was a mutated monster off of Luthor's (Joker in this case) DNA.

This is clearly a Superman movie. They just tried to bring in many characters that made the movie look REALLY bad.

My Final Thought.... The characters in the cartoon series seem very realistic in many parts. That's what makes the characters so unique. However, this movie seems very much like a cartoon on many parts. Watch the cartoon version of these characters and you will see. For people who don't know about the characters will most likely enjoy this movie.
I really wanted to like the movie because it had potential to be the best movie of 2016. It just seems like they just focused on advertising the movie more instead of spending some time on researching the characters. At least the advertising part worked. Just the work that they delivered was really bad. I was disappointed. Will not watch again.",1475020800,,2064,4.549865229110512

And I'm left with little hope for a rise in their potential. DC use to dominate when it came to film adaptations, well, let me rephrase, dominate in initial release of characters and slowly deminish with each film, they are now been kicking off the a bad start two films in a row.

Focusing on this film specifically the only great thing was Ben Afflect getting redeemed over his daredevil role when most of us were incredibly amazed at him being the best part of the film.

doomsday fiasco, supermans no longer the boyscout, luther (enough said please someone get him his medication), whatever the dream time guy thing was all about, batman superman exchange over wonder woman showing up, the list goes on. It's all been said before.

I for one could even choke down the whole mothers names ending the fighting but does superman have to just be this brooding moran who's terrible at his job and quick to a punch plus the whole Luther situation (it's not the actors fault they hired him and gave him the script to work with)?

Two things from this film that gave it rise was the hope of wonder woman redeeming the franchise plus Aflect making us all regret ever doubting him.

Let's just hope aquamans upcoming role turns out fantastic and they give the actor more then to lines of dialog finally unlike many of his previous roles. Let's get the stick out of supermans back side for a change, and for once stop relying on action to fill the gaps of terrible script concepts. We fans want to enjoy more then just things blowing up.

To be clear, the only reason i won't give it 5 is Batman made a really uncharacteristic choice later in the film. THAT BEING SAID, i am a huge fan on the dark knight returns series and this movie pays a nice homage to it. Batman kills people. A LOT of people but this is right in character for the old, battered and tired Bruce that exists in the DKR line. It is not for everyone as this movie is a necessary stepping stone to get the League together. The pacing is a tad bit slow according to numerous friends but i didn't notice any issues as i indulged in the references and homages sprinkled throughout. leaving a good bit to be desired but certainly worth my time and i am so glad this film exists.

7700573,5,B01D64VSYI,"5 STARS! BATMAN VRS SUPERMAN DAWN OF JUSTICE!

Witnesses! Crimes! Hearings! Trials! Judges! Booming Action!

The first half of the movie seems like another Batman movie, then the second half seems like a Superman type of movie. The new characters and the new type of plot of super heroes fighting each other in a big movie like this makes it a somewhat hyped up movie to watch.

There are very few disappointments when it comes to the action later on where there is the expected Batman Versus Superman. The anticipation of that conflict really masks and deceives the audience to a certain point because there are obvious other issues these characters are trying to work out.

Lex Luther is back in action on the big screen since the last Superman. He is trying to run a blackmail and kidnapping ring though so of course he ends up the suspect, and caught as a result of his own insane greediness. The plot is somewhat complicated in the first half, but then the second starts turning into the expected Batman Versus Superman hype, and show down. Lex Luther surprisingly survives this conflict. But, one of the lead heroes does in fact die, so although Lex Luther appears captured at the end, he is faintly seen as the winner as well. The audience has to really see the movie though to know exactly who won, and died.

Wonder woman also joins the action in the second half of the movie. She becomes one of the leading action characters, contributing to the end of another new threat created by the powers of crypton on planet earth.

Great action sequences leading to the end of the movie, and the end of the Batman versus Superman conflict. There is also a significant amount of unexpected plot twists due to Lex Luther's studying of krypton, and the eventual misuse of its disastrous powers on earth. Ironically this occurs in the already crashed alien ship, but an uncontrollable life is brought back into existence to the previously evil alien world on earth.

There is a certain life after death message regarding aliens in this movie, which may seem unrealistic even for a fictional comic book movie. But, the optimistic life after death message is still very present for the aliens. There is a an alien resurrection theme as well as a strong immortal theme as usual with Superman. When that is thought about, and then combined with the difference between Batman and Superman, there is not much life after death in Batman movies. Superman seems more optimistic to a certain point because aliens can literally be brought back to life. Of course whether the alien is good or bad is the main discussion in this movie as well. In Batman it is more of a memory relived, and more of a spiritual experience affecting an individual only.",1474761600,,2734,4.695198329853862

I was pleasantly surprised he did a great job portraying Batman. Jeremy Irons was a perfect Alfred. I wish they would have had a little more screen time for Wonder Woman. I do agree Jesse Eisenburg's portrayal of Lex Luther was just not that good and actually a little irritating. I also feel that the they dropped the ball on Doomsday. The character looked ridiculous. I would have had him a little more daunting like they do in the comic books. The idea of him being a completely mindless pawn of Lex Luthor was terrible. But overall the superhero team of the Ben Affleck Batman, Henry Cavill Superman and Gal Gadot Wonder Woman was spot on. All three do a great job playing those iconic characters.",1474588800,5,865,4.481012658227848

7700625,4,B01D64VSYI,"A ton of people have destroyed this movie in reviews. Everyone is certainly entitled to their opinion. In my opinion, WB really screwed this movie up (which is not entirely out of the ordinary). Many ripped Snyder for the failure but after seeing the additional 30 minutes of extra footage, I am convinced that Snyder is far from the issue with the initial release.

The extended cut has a lot of the necessary setup information that is necessary to understand the full extent of many of the plot points that I feel viewing in theaters were left to the imagination/assumption. I love Christian Bale's Batman so I was a bit hesitant at first but Ben Affleck absolutely nailed this version of the character. Henry Cavill is perfect for the role of Superman and I like the casting of Wonder Woman, too.

People got bent out of shape because Superman killed someone and then laid waste to Metropolis in the Man of Steel. They forget that Superman was only Superman for a couple of weeks at that point and had not really settled into the role fully. Also, if beings of his capability existed and battled, let's face reality: there is a great chance that collateral damage would occur. In this movie, Superman has matured and found his place.

Similarly to how people who lacked an understanding of the plot ripped Superman in Man of Steel, they got upset because Batman was to violent and would never kill anyone. How would you feel after 20 years of crime fighting and the city is still falling apart plus Robin was murdered and now powerful aliens have landed on Earth and caused mass destruction, destroying your building and your close friends? After all of that, added on top of his parent's death which still haunts him, it should not be a surprise that Batman may have slightly lost his moral compass. This movie shows the re-connection of Batman with his morals and values as his relationship with Superman goes from mistrust and anger to friendship and understanding.

At first, even the Lex Luther portrayal got to me a bit but watching this again, it is yet another example of an origin story for the character. My expectation was set on previous knowledge from comics and other media but Snyder opted to show more of an origin story, a younger version of the character, who embraces the familiar role (and bald look) at the end of the movie, almost certain to re-appear at some point.

The fight scenes were well choreographed. My favorite was the fight scene on the dock where Batman goes to save Martha.

The plot was a nice weave of Lex Luther pulling strings to make Superman and Batman fight each other and play behind the scenes in various government affairs.

The soundtrack was also solid and worked well with the movie to compliment the scenes and add to the mood for each occasion.

I would encourage anyone who saw the theater release to re-visit this movie and give it another chance. The tone is a bit more serious than the Marvel movies, to some extent, but who cares? WB can have a different flavor than Marvel. It's like chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Very different but both awesome. This movie is not as bad as others may make it seem. The bad part was that this Extended version should have been released in theaters.",1474502400,,3245,4.641114982578397

7700631,4,B01D64VSYI,"The most hated superhero movie of 2016 because it wasn't a Marvel superhero movie.

But the movie is really good, is enterntaining and as every superhero movie it has those ""what whas that"" moments. While I'm not a die hard DC fan, I know enough to understand most of the easter eggs that the movie throw at the audience. Still, most of them might be too confussing for the average movie goer, and I think that's where the movie tends to its audience. Perhaps the director would have chosen to deliver these bits of information in a better way? I don't know. As the saying goes ""we are all generals after the war"".

But the thing I like the most about BvS is that it isn't a Marvel movie. It doesn't have that silly Stan Lee Cameo with the funny one-line dialog. It doesn't have those silly comedian superheroes that try to make the audience laugh while trying to save the world. It's not an advertising for other movies while claiming it's about something else.

BvS is a great movie, it's a superhero movie and it delivers what it promises. If you have problems with silly plot twists like the ""Martha"" or the ""Bucky is my friend"" debacle then this movie isn't for you, and perhaps no supehero movie is for you. If you are a Marvel fan, then this movie definetly isn't for you. But if you are a a normal movie fan, who likes action flicks, and enjoy two hours of enterntainement I suggest you give this movie a try.

Ben Affleck has done a very good job of convincing me he was born for this role given his age and previous roles.  Jesse Eisenberg almost steals the show, his psychotic blabbering all to convincing.  But the entry of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is by far the most memorable moment in this movie (""I thought she was with you!"") and her kicking ass lets you know there is more to come from this character.

I absolutely LOVED Jeremy Irons as Alfred (even more than I liked Michael Caine in the role), and I was amazed by Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot surprised me and did a wonderful job. She makes a fantastic Wonder Woman. Again, sorry I ever doubted her.

I like this package because it contained the Blu-ray, digital copy, and 4K Blu-ray, however, I dropped one star because the extended version of the film is not on the 1080p Blu-ray. However, it is available on the digital copy but since it is an UltraViolet copy I cannot watch on my TV, only portable devices such as iPads. My advise to WB is to include a 1080p extended Blu-ray or an iTunes copy of the movie. Some manufactures give you both UV and iTunes versions of their films, this should be no exception. Other than that the transfer quality of the 1080p Blu-ray is great! I cannot comment on the 4K version yet but I will update this review once I get a 4K system. There are 2 hours of special features that come on the standard Blu-ray disc as well (including a glimpse at DC Comic's new super hero cinematic future).

Hopefully D.C. works on its writing and story lines. I grew up a D.C. over Marvel, but Marvel movies are so much better.

Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons made a great conflicted Bruce Wayne and an excellent Alfred respectively. Henry Cavill shines in interviews and he radiates hope and happiness, but they need to let him show that in the movies.

Superman knows Batman has bullets made of Kryptonite but he did nothing to protect himself.  Wonder Woman came from no-where and without saying anything knew the whole plan to destroy the alien.  Louis Lane is actually the bionic woman, how did she know she had to get the spear and that Superman neded it?  The plan to kill the alien worked without no one sharing it...wow these heroes are literally ""Super Heroes"" but yet they could not figure out they were manipulated by one crazy man.  The false claim against Superman was bogus...guy does a lot of great things and we find a few dead bodies and without conducting a thorough investigation the world blames him after one incident.  Maybe they could have used Aqua man to throw the spear out of the water or something since they eluded to his existence. Maybe he could have delivered the spear to Super Bat man to kill the alien.  I was skeptical how batman can beat Superman...but was disappointed by the loosely put together movie.  The movie trailer was 1000% better than the movie itself. We probably need to rename the Dark Knight series because this bat man is darker than all previous Batman movies.  We need to do a better job before we release the Gazillion of other super hero movies that are planned like Wonder Woman, Aqua man etc.  BTW, the new generation has no clue about the abilities of the characters so you need to give the background so they can follow the story.",1474243200,5,1579,4.607142857142857

The Ultimate Edition is far superior and I can't understand why they didn't release it originally (I'm guessing because of the 3 hour length).  It clarifies some of the character motivations and plot questions I had originally.  Plus there is a great subplot showing Clark Kent and Lois doing investigative journalism that really added to their story lines.  It doesn't fix some of the characterization issues people had with Batman, Superman, and Lex Luthor, but on the whole is the version I'd recommend for anyone who hasn't seen the film, or for those who enjoyed the theatrical cut and would like more.",1474243200,,710,5.042735042735043

7700743,4,B01D64VSYI,"The theatrical version was okay and I enjoyed it but the Ultimate Edition was a better overall movie and story.  There were some beats that needed help but as most people will tell you is that Gail Gadot's Wonder Woman was the stand-out of the film.  I think mostly because this is the first live-action version since the 70's and everyone was worried that it would not come out right.  Ben Affleck does a good turn as Batman but I do believe that they made him too dark and overlooked some of the better qualities that make him a good character.  I was not a fan of the Lex Luthor character and much more prefer the older business type character that was made popular in the 90's and 2000's.  Henry Cavill I believe is a good choice for Superman but has not been given a lot to work with up to date.  Also, I must confess that I do not care for this interpretation of Lois Lane.  There just appears to be something lacking.
With most movies of this genre the blame for a less enjoyable story lies with the story and the script.  The emphasis on style over substance is the root of the problem.  It's the same problem that Avengers: Age of Ultron had and so did Suicide Squad.

He is nothing more than a ""cardboard-cutout"" personality. In fact, in this film he is totally lacking in personality. Oh, for Chrispher Reeves! He embodied the very essence of Superman. This present actor - what's his name? -  is like a wannabe imitator who is giving a very poor performance. And Lex Luthor! OMG, talk a childish wimp! He looks nothing like former characterizations.

I only have a DVD player so all I could play was the theatrical version. I understand the ""Ultimate Extended Version"" was better. I'll probably never know. Maybe Superman is better off dead. Moviemakers have beentryhing to kill him off anyway. Stories like that one in the film aren't worth the 3-hour viewing time - or any viewing time for that matter.",1474156800,2,1022,4.735955056179775

7700776,1,B01D64VSYI,"Stupid premise for a movie; Superman could take some dude in a bat suit in less than 1/2 second (kryptonite or no kryptonite).

The two then become immediate besties bonded by their mommy love (I'm sure there's a website for that). Not to mention Henry's permanent ""who farted?"" stink face does nothing to endear Superman like past actors who have portrayed him.  Then there's Jessie as Lex Luther, seriously?!?! The guy is about as menacing as a geriatric rabid squirrel. And, the ending is so ""doh!"" Homer Simpson forehead slappingly stupid, I barely have words, um...why doesn't Superman just get Wonder Woman to pick up the kryptonite spear and use it instead of him since she's holding her own against Doomsday meanwhile batman is writing his mommy about his new BFF Sups?!?!  Never thought I'd say it but, I'm glad Superman is ""dead"" I just wish he'd stay dead since Hollywood is doing their best to colossally fudge up the character.

Bruce Wayne is to DC what Iron Man is to Marvel.  A way to humanize the hero so we can be a part of it.  Bruce Wayne has a feeling that the meta humans will need to fight, and for good reason.

Which i loved, but isn't indiscriminate killing why people hated man of steel? When hes not on a rampage he is used comically?! ( i guess warner bros is back paddling from taking a serious tone to stand apart from marvel ) The jokes are terrible too. Jesse Eisenberg is AWFUL as always! That guy can only do one character and it has no business being labeled lex luthor, jr or not! The doomsday origin is completely rewritten and mangled. Im not a stickler for comic canon or anything, but doomsday had a very specific origin story for a reason, and it was just thrown away here. They couldve easily named this generic villain something else and done doomsday later. I suppose they figured since they were having superman commit suicide it had to involve doomsday. DC is messing up big time. Instead of building a proper universe they're giving into the pressure to catch up to marvel. Hence throwing batman vs superman, the death of superman, and the formation of the justice league into the same movie! Oh and lets not forget, the flashes appearance from the future. Unless they pull in some of the mind power behind the flash tv series, theres going to be an unbelievable mess coming. Back on point, Henry Cavill was good. Better than batfleck. I was suprised by Gal Gadot! Not only that she is a capable actress, but wonder woman stole the show in the action sequences! I was sure she would be the worst thing to come from DC but her solo story is the only one im looking forward to now! It seems creative control has been stripped away from snyder and is now in the hands of a studio that just doesnt know what to do. First lesson to learn from marvel, put one guy in charge of the overall project and make that his only job. Of course it has to be someone as capable as kevin fiege. Good luck!

Plus, I was miffed they'd decided to already get a new batman after making such an awesome recent series.  Once it came out on Amazon, I read about the 'Extended Cut' version and how the douchey MBAs in the studio had taken the awesome director's cut and ruined it to make it more palatable to the American audience based on the pseudoscience b.s. ""studies"" MBAs all spend a small fortune to learn about.

I went into this expecting to be disappointed.  I might have given it a 4 otherwise.  But given my expectations, this movie was amazing.  Ben Affleck, who I'm not usually a die hard fan of, actually pulled off the dark psychopath version of Batman I've been waiting decades for them to make.  And the Superman plotline was good too.  It was a marathon to watch, but at the end, I just thought, ""wow... I can't believe they fit all that in.""  I don't know what could have been cut out.

The Flashpoint Paradox elements with the Flash was something this movie didn't need.  Ben Affleck as Batman totally saved this film.  How?  His performance was totally on par with Michael Keaton and Christian Bale. Ben looked and acted like a more seasoned Batman.  Superman portrayed by Henry Cavill came off as flat and generic.  It's not his fault because his part wasn't written well.  Superman was not portrayed as a very bright guy.  He immediately goes after Batman for being a violent vigilante.  Didn't Superman kill General Zod in his first film?  How can he pass judgement on Batman?  This is where the logic falls apart in the plot.  The battle between Superman and Batman was just going through motions.  We saw the outcome of this fight 30 years ago in Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns!

I did find the theatrical verison a bit choppy but the Ultimate Edition that I pre-ordered did recover. This version did received a standing ovation from me.

I'm excited for the next chapter of this new installment of DC Stories. The casting was perfect. My predictions of JLA & Wonder Woman will be received well from true DC supporters like myself. Can't wait to give my money away to great company like WARNER BROS.

I'm never convinced that Batman's anger and grievances against Superman are legit.  Batman seemed unreasonable in his anger at Superman and I never bought it - at all.

Superman does a decent job playing his role but the I felt the focus was more on batman. Wonder Woman really ties everything together and plays a perfect role.

I truly had LOW expectations for this movie.  I really thought, this is going to be so dumb, but I have to see Ben Affleck attempt to play Superman!  I really only watch it out of curiosity!
Surprising this movie far exceeded my expectations!  It was well filmed, the graphics and stunts were great!  The storyline captured my attention that I was sad when it was over!  Normally a 2 and a half hour movie gets so borring and I lose interest,  but this movie kept me interested from start to finish!
After much skeptisim of the new Batman I now think that Ben Affleck did an AMAZING job!  He IS The Batman!  Compared to all the other Batmans Ben Afleck is THE BEST!  I sure hope he gets some kind of Award for his role, because he did a remarkable job!
I also love that this movie is a prelude to The Justice League.  WonderWoman rocked her part in this film and I am excited to see her in the next movies.

The title of case says ""Batman v. Superman Ultimate Edition 3D"".

Shocked to find out inside there is NO 3D version of this, only the theatrical.
So basically you are being lied to right to your face and we pay more money for it?

If it says it's the 3D version right there on the front, then it should include it!

I'm calling WB and see what happens and we should all should able to return it or get our money back.

7700970,4,B01D64VSYI,"I enjoyed Batman v Superman as an action comic book movie.  The story was preposterous,  The presentation of Batman, Superman, and Lex Luther were out of keeping with the early comic books presentations.  The one piece Batman/Superman costumes were totally in both out of place in design and fabric.  If I weren't an old comic book fan of the originals who was curious about this movie I would have totally I ignored it.

7700971,2,B01D64VSYI,"I wanted to like this movie, and for the first 30-45 minutes it was pretty good. I went in with low expectations from some of the reviews I had read but I really thought it was better than expected... at first. Then it just went on, and on, and on. The dark depressing tone of the movie really weighs it down and makes it hard to enjoy after a while. The heroes are so dark and gloomy they almost seem like bad guys. No one really feels heroic (except maybe WW). Both Batman and Superman seem like they are in some sedative induced haze. I just see this as a huge missed opportunity where if there was at least a little bit of fun and adventure injected into the story it could have been a really fun movie. And it should have been!! This should have been THE BATMAN and SUPERMAN movie for the next 20 years! It's hard to imagine people will watch and enjoy this movie 20 years from now.",1473552000,,887,4.162790697674419
7700972,5,B01D64VSYI,"I've been a Batman fan all my life and a DC Comics disciple for the past 5 years. Surprisingly, instead of being more forgiving of DC films, I actually am more critical. Needless to say I was apprehensive about Batman v Superman. I was extremely surprised to find how much I loved this film, especially considering the critics' backlash.

Pros:
Mass Content- Like most of my favorite graphic novels, this gives you a ton of content for a film. It has very dense storytelling and plenty of Easter Eggs.
Graphics- Visually, it's very beautiful.
Acting- The Ultimate Edition really improves the display of actors; minus Jessie Eisenberg who I view as the film's weakest point.
Music- Hans and Junkie XL did a fantastic job on the score, and it really plays to the scenes well.

Cons:
Mass Content- This is also a point of contention for the casual viewer. There's so much going on that many people have expressed getting lost or not understanding the purpose of different scenes. Perhaps, this is where Zack Snyder as a fan got carried away and forgot that people don't know all the stories that certain scenes are paying tribute to.
Storytelling- The film is admittedly pretty jumpy. It hops around from Past, Present, and an unresolved prophetic future. The Ultimate Edition definitely helps smooth out some of the loose ends however.
Lex Luthor- Technically, Lex's son Alexander Luthor, but still just a goofy and neurotic portrayal that makes him seem more like an insecure immoral rich kid than a brilliant and confident sociopath. His ticks are plain annoying. He resembles the mannerisms of the Riddler more than Luthor.

At the end of the film I still felt completely drawn in by the story. You could really feel Batman's rage on screen and the fight scenes were nothing short of brutal. Henry Cavill did a great job playing a Superman who is having a crisis of character, with Amy Adams playing the strong female pillar for Clark that Lois Lane is known for. The film draws on two classic stories in the Batman/Superman lore that is ultimately well acted, visually superb and has very emotional moments that make you feel for Clark and Bruce. The Ultimate Edition took everything I love about these characters, put them on screen and then added to a film that I personally connected with. Do yourself a favor and don't take this film at face value. Try to understand the philosophical implications that Snyder is trying to address; the film goes much deeper than action and costumes and has a lot to say about the human condition.",1473552000,3,2536,4.7853881278538815

7700974,4,B01D64VSYI,"Having not seen the theatrical version, I'll say that this extended cut was well executed and ultimately fulfilling. With that said, I'll also say this film is also incredibly depressing. It's like they decided to standardize on the bleakest version of Gotham for the whole planet.

I think with three recent quality Batman films in the vaults, they could have instead gone in a different direction and standardized on a bit cheerier universe that was more classically Metropolis-like with no ill effects. In fact, I think that might have been more satisfying. Of course that would be ignoring the last Superman film, so it's probably this vision now or nothing.

Ultimately, if you don't mind the body count, gratuitous violence, and overall dread that permeates the entire film, there's some quality stuff in there.",1473552000,,817,5.08955223880597

While the 2 main actors seem to be a very good choice, Jesse Eisenberg is definitely not adequate for Lex Luthor. Too young and inadequate. Apart the several errors which every good fan will easily spot (one above all: batman using fire weapons twice), the plot is the main problem here.

Why are batman & superman fighting against each other? For a very futile and avoidable reason. The role of wonder woman is almost absent and pointless, a beautiful woman that is basically there just to show off, she maybe speaks 3 or 4 times in the whole movie.

The final battle is awful and a complete waste of special effects and precious movie-time which could have been used in a much more efficient way.",1473465600,2,803,4.608391608391608

The side-heroes of the Justice League were a few seconds cameo appearances, but that's how it should be - this movie is, after all, about Batman and Superman. The beginning of the plot was very fast-paced, and you have to keep up with it to appreciate the finer points of plot development. But then the second half of the movie slows down long enough to really flesh out the action and inter-character tension.

For those who enjoy spoilers and don't mind laughing at dramatic points in the movie, watch the Honest Trailers and How it Should Have Ended on Youtube. They are right on, and reveal one or two plot flaws you otherwise wouldn't notice during the movie.

7701045,5,B01D64VSYI,"When I first saw this film, I admit that I was infected by the skepticism that litters social media.  Two years before the film was released the idea that  Zack Snyder was directing it created nerd anxiety and tension that he would somehow destroy the legacy of the two most iconic Superheroes in American pop culture. They have been iconic for generations. I liked the film, and after watching it again, I love it. Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman was as close to an actual comic book interpretation of the character that has ever been seen on film. He reminds of the Batman from Dark Knight Returns (A book you should invest in and read)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>

I absolutely loved Jeremy Irons as Alfred.  The thing about Superman and Batman that I think the Director missed is that Bruce is the Dark and Clark is the light. Superman should not be dark and brooding. I get that he is struggling with the balance act of his alien heritage and his human roots but still Superman brooding is not a norm for the character.  He is the optimist even when he has had to be heavy handed. Metropolis is a city of hope. Not a city of despair and misery. Gotham is dark and filled with freaks and myths of Bats throwing criminals off rooftops. The best comics book interpretation I have even seen of the Batman-Superman dichotomy is Jeph Loeb's Batman-Superman series. I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Batman-VOL-01-Public-Enemies/dp/1401202209/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman/Batman VOL 01: Public Enemies</a>&nbsp;and I wish the Director had taken some time to read it before he made this movie. If he did, I suspect he missed the whole point.  There should be a contrast and a conflict in these two opposing forces representing these two vastly different ideals.  I also thought the movie failed to flesh out Lex Luthor and in particular his xenophobic behavior about Superman and his belief that this ""alien"" was considered a supreme being. I am not sure Jessie Eisenberg was the right choice. It is nothing personal but it was not the way to go. Read Luthor by Brian Azarello<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Absolute-Joker-Luthor/dp/1401245048/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Absolute Joker/Luthor</a>&nbsp;When you read this interpretation of Lex Luthor, you will understand where I am coming from with this. Lex Luthor is obsessed with being the ultimate human being and then an alien comes along with power to level the planet and his ego can't handle it. That is Lex Luthor and I think the film sort of misses that.

I didn't understand how you have over 50 years of source material from some brilliant writers and you don't use any of it to help define your characters. The script suffered and it is unfortunate. I Loved the action sequences. I Loved Wonder Woman but I just thought the movie lacked the heart and soul of what made me fall in love with DC Comics as a kid.  In this age where comic movies are evaluated by one standard (hint: Excelsior!!!) you need to pull out your best arsenal if you want to tell a story that matters. It nailed some things to its credit but it missed a lot of the nuances of Superman and Batman. I still loved it and again, I recommend it. I also recommend that you purchase and read the Graphic Novels that I recommended.  The DC Universe is amazing. A lot of dope stories from those comics. The toybox of heroes they have to play with is dope. They should not have struggled with this film the way they did. The film should have been a contrast of their beliefs and philosophies. Action is cool but Batman and Superman's ideals also what make their friendship work. There are plenty of books that deal with that.

This film will be a cult classic.",1473465600,,3946,5.169278996865204

Things that make characters look a lot less dumb.  On the other hand, it's only fixing minor problems.  What this movie really needed was to be shorter and dumber, not long and complicated.  After thinking about it, it's probably not very hard to make Superman and Batman fight each other.  It certainly shouldn't require this level of time-wasting plans-within-plans nonsense that Luthor wastes his time with.  Something like two thirds of this movie is wasted by Lex Luthor building a Rube Goldberg machine of plans.  He could have just framed Batman for murder or something in 30 minutes.  But I still like the fighting, which is pretty well done.  Batman and Wonder Woman overall also stand out as high points of the movie.

I immediately grew to accept Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman (although still do NOT like the retro-ridiculous costume) and Henry Cavill is top-notch as ever! Jesse Eisenberg's role was the ONLY aweful thing in the movie, NOT his fault, but absolutely disgusting - much worse than Christian Hayden as Anakin - totally the director's & writer's fault!!!

Batman seems placed for no other purpose than to meet superman, it isn't a fluid encounter.  Superman seems jaded already, although this has been done in the comics, it took decades for Superman to get to this point.  Wonder Woman was the one really good part, mainly because her appearances were short and didn't run the risk of being ruined.

Blu-ray content review:  No more Ultraviolet please.  Or if you do provide it,  please provide other options.  We all know iTunes is the most popular option, why not have it?  Ridiculous.  I'd rather buy the digital version and not have to purchase twice.",1473379200,,704,4.735537190082645

They were a bit glaring for me, but it was very forgivable given the rest of the movie and how well it flowed. The ultimate edition should have been what they showed in theaters. Definitely gonna recommend to friends

I hope they don't worry about length and whatnot for future movies; just release the movie that's gonna be best.  People will see it regardless and they'll like it  better if it's awesome and long as opposed to short and sucky.",1473379200,,716,4.725806451612903

Lex Luthor is entirely miscast, Bryan Cranston would have owned this role, and now we're stuck with whiny skinny Jesse Eisenberg in the DCEU, and Jared Leto as Joker.  Even just a little exposition of who Steppenwolf was, and what Apokalips is, would have gone miles to establish where Justice League is going instead of a bunch of wishy washy dream sequences no one understood.

I don't think it was Ben Affleck's fault even though his face doesn't move much...lol. I think it was the script itself I think they tried to stuff so much into the movie it kind of left me disappointed.

His scene fighting a group of murderous thugs in a deserted warehouse was undeniably one of the best fight scenes in history! Henry Cavill, is the best Superman/Kent to date. He really knows how to ""Rock"" that cape with Kryptonian swagger!!! Gal Gadot is a beautiful  addition to this saga. For those who remember the original WW comics, the Amazon Queen was nothing to play with, unless you were just one of those people who loved having their butt handed to them.

I know that people who make movies based on comics probably want to be Deep and Significant and Serious; but need they ruin the movie in order to do it?

What is the problem with having Superman and Wonder Woman in the bright primary colors that have always been their costumes - or at least always until the people who write comic books decided that ""gritty realism"" and dingy darkness are more ""adult,"" and after all who cares about the children?

For some reason Henry Cavill just doesn't look Supermanlike to me, and it isn't just his dull-colored outfit.

Apart from her costume - those were some interesting outfits Wonder Woman was almost wearing.

As someone pointed out, it seemed as if they wanted Lex Luthor to be a Joker clone.

I can't wait to see more of her in her feature film. Jesse Eisenberg was completely unbearable as Lex Luthor, the least compelling super villain I think I've ever witnessed.

At any point in time one question from either main character would have ended the entire movie and the fact that neither asked it was too much disbelief to suspend.  And the portrait of Lex Luthor was horrible.  He was the joker, the psycho nemesis of the Batman, not the genius nemesis of Superman.

I did like the philosophical themes of a being like Superman essentially watching over the world, and I thought that Ben Affleck did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne given the context of the story in which this incarnation was based on.

7701221,2,B01D64VSYI,"How to destroy decades of great storytelling with a single film:

- Have Lex Luthor act like several previous TV/film portrayals of The Riddler, then throw sporadic Yoda ""hmm?""'s in there for the hell of it. While you're at it, make sure that the character suddenly pops up during important scenes where tension was in danger of building to an interesting level.
- Have Batman go on a murderous, destructive rampage after repeatedly soapboxing about the alien threat of murder and destruction...all to try and steal a rock that he merely suspects will hurt Kryptonians.
- Create a Batman/Superman fight that looks worse than a WWE Monday Night Raw mid-card bout, complete with a Big Show heel-to-babyface turn.
- Take a couple of Oscar-winning actresses and have them play characters that are complete wastes of skin. Yes, Clark still loves Lois, golly gosh darn it, even though she has the personality of a sidewalk in this Amy Adams iteration. Then there's the amazing Holly Hunter, who plays the latest ""superheroes must be controlled"" politician that we now see in every single superhero film. Don't blink or you'll miss her.

Still, I'm giving the Ultimate Edition two stars because the first half of it is somewhat decent. Take Lex Luthor out of that portion and you'd be left with something good.

Slight spoiler: At around the 1:45 mark, the movie turns into a train wreck. Superman goes to Batman for help and Batman literally tries to end his life. Not neutralize him or anything that Batman would normally do. No. The vigilante who has been merciful to serial killers for 20 years decides that he's going to cross that line and freaking kill Superman.

All in all, a decent movie and yes, I bought it on Amazon Video and have been watching it over and over.",1473033600,,513,4.151515151515151
7701228,3,B01D64VSYI,"How well you are going to like this movie probably depends a lot on what you want in an action movie.  If you are mainly interested in adrenaline-driven spectacle, you have it in spades, here.  If plot and character development are a priority, well probably not so much.

The movie showed a lot of promise in the opening scenes -- many well-crafted moments which suggested a lot of thought in staging and planning.  For instance, there is a scene where Bruce Wayne's parents are killed where a very clever use of a string of pearls provides all the instensity and drama of the kill without the necessity of any of the gore or graphic violence.  It is followed up with an extreme closeup of one lifeless eye which told the whole story.  I was impressed and looked forward to where things were going -- unfortunately, I think it foreshadowed a much better film than the one I watched.

The acting was generally quite excellent . . . when the actors got to do more than punch/shoot at one another or stand by watching the scenery explode, burn or crumble.  Ben Affleck can do the brooding, troubled loner with the best of them.  Amy Adams as Lois Lane was equally convincing whether portraying strength or vulnerability.  Henry Cavill's Superman was rather complex.  In the Superman persona he often seemed rather cold and distant which made me wonder why he chose the role of hero -- did he really care or was he just bored and needed something to do?  As Clark, however, he seemed more human and thoughtful -- when the movie allowed him to be more than just a prop in a scene.  I particularly liked the fact that Laurence Fishburne's Perry White, seemed to be as much involved in evading the slide of print news towards irrelevance as in fighting to meet a deadline.  Diana/Wonder Woman seemed intriguing and her introduction sets the stage for her own feature quite nicely.  One of my favorite characters was Alfred -- loyal, dedicated and competent, but not quite on board with all of the proceedings.  My least favorite character was Lex Luthor -- for one the actor seemed too young to be convincing in the role, but also because, rather than being portrayed as a crazed genius, much of the time he just seemed crazy.  But however good the acting, there wasn't enough acting, plot, or character development to make it more than a comic book on film (there wasn't as much as a comic book in print, for that matter). The worst of the Marvel-universe movies had more character development than anything in this movie.

The spectacle aspect of the movie was overwhelming -- scene after scene of skyscrapers being ripped apart; explosion shock waves which cover city blocks; fist-fights among super-heroes/villains which go on and on wreaking more devastation on property than on the combatants.  It's not like it wasn't exciting but after awhile it was draining and, often didn't make a great deal of sense.

Making sense of the movie was one of the biggest challenges -- scenes with dialog, character-development, plot-development, etc., seemed to consist mainly of brief vignettes stitched together by action-sequences.  It was almost as if the scenes which were supposed to make it all coherent were cut out so they could include more explosions.  Wayne's motives for attacking Superman seemed vague at best and his change of heart even more confusing without fully understanding his original motives.

Much of the movie strained suspension of disbelief --  for instance, apparently no one on Krypton ever saw much need for security re Kryptonian computers.  For Batman to be slammed at superspeed into a wall without damage would require a good deal more than armor but it happens repeatedly in the movie (yes, I know it's based on a comic book where the laws of physics are frequently ignored but it still created a lot of dissonance for me).

Ultimately, for me, the big problem was just the endless piling on of bigger and bigger scenes of destruction and mayhem.  It wore me down and undermined any believability the plot may have had.  The end was a bit unexpected and pretty much begs for a sequel but frankly, by the time I got there, I really didn't care that much any more.",1473033600,,4184,4.74171270718232

It's good, but action movies have gotten so freaking cookie cutter these days no matter how much you try to develop the story, once you boil down the key elements, they are all bet the farm on an extreme collage of action cgi scenes that are like 3 sec long and are just a mass of jerky, panning, over done, fast paced cuts with awesome bass and overly loud smashing things that really just becomes boring because of trying to be to action'y'.. It's a recipe that works for the masses, quick cuts and loud booms.. The cgi is top notch but doesn't mean it's good, all the ""action"" movies since since the millennia seem to just try to make up enough storyline to get to some epic 25min long battle scene that I generally prefer to sleep through. :)

The movie is just fine don't get me wrong, but I'm so sick of all the emphasis being put on getting to some big battle scene and it then it ruined by trying to hard to fast... It's just like music videos. Patch 30 fast moving 2 second clips of Puff Daddy kicking a leg or moving an arm and it can make it look like 'maybe' he's a good dancer, but in reality he didn't do a lick of dancing to actually make the video..

7701241,5,B01D64VSYI,"Spoiler alert for those who still haven't seen the movie.

The theatres should have shown the Ultimate Cut in theatres. Straight to the point is I loved this movie from beginning to end when it was out in the theatres. It fell in sync with the Frank Miller Dark Knight Comics and the Death of Superman comic. The critics were super harsh on this movie but after seeing the Ultimate Cut, the movie made a lot more sense if you were not an avid reader of the comics and the history of Batman and Superman. The Ultimate Cut plugs up many plot holes that were in the Theatrical Cut.

Snyder's movies are darker versions of what Marvel/Disney are going for and this movie should not be compared to those movies. That is the biggest problem you could make. DC movies are not meant to be like Marvel movies and that's what I love about them. Not everyone is going to be a fan of this movie but it is a must watch and you definitely have to see the Ultimate Cut to fully appreciate this movie.

Hans Zimmer absolutely kills it in this movie as he creates a scores that is just beautiful and perfectly flows with the movie. Visually the artistic expression throughout the movie is completely well done. For those who are expecting a giant fight between Batman and Superman, that's not really going to happen. While the fight is very well-done in my opinion and perfect, many may not enjoy it if they're expecting the whole movie to be fighting you will be disappointed. I find it perfect because you can't revolve a hole movie of just Batman and Superman fighting all the time, not even the cartoons and comics do that.

This Blu-Ray is perfect and definitely worth buying.",1472947200,3,1664,4.481848184818482

Despite learning my lesson over and over again, I don't know why I always put so much stock in movie reviews.
This movie got some crap but I thought it was pretty entertaining.  It was about a 3:1 split of the recent Christian Bale Batman movies vs the last Superman movie.  Meaning the first 3/4ths of the movie had a great setup and dialog (some people said it was slow but I thought it really helped build the story).  Then the last 1/4th of the movie was the ridiculous random smashing through buildings like in the last superman movie that almost made me just turn off the movie",1472947200,,609,4.419642857142857

I enjoyed this version way better than the original cut.  I understand the reasoning for cutting the movie to make it go from R to PG-13, but that decision ruined a really good super hero movie. The R or Ultimate Edition is the version that fans would have enjoyed more and would have better matched against Civil War.

This version, the ""Ultimate Edition"", is what the director actually intended, what the actors are (justly) proud of, and what the film should be judged by. Yes, even here, everything is not spoon fed to us; you must pay attention and actually think about what you are seeing. Yet this cut provides the material necessary to reward that attention, and which was so destructively excised from the wide-release version.

It is not a slam-dunk. The 14 year-old in Mr. Snyder still refuses to surrender an adolescent preoccupation with (utterly unnecessary) body splat, there remain a few moments that seem inadequately contextualized and/or marginally contrived, and the ""controversial moment"" - in this version FAR more explicaple - is still a bit awkward and could have been better presented. Nevertheless, this is a GREAT superhero movie - layered, nuanced, fun, and made with a respect for the intelligence of the audience, both general and fans. The acting, special effects, pacing, story and plot are all very, very good and the atmospherics, ambition, and the score - particulary ""Wonder Woman's theme - are truly exceptional. This is great stuff....until the adrenaline wears off, and you realize Batman is an repentant murderer and Superman has forgotten he was raised in Kansas and is not an idiot.

Mr. Snyder, you have every right to make whatever kind of movie you wish, just don't call this vigilante Batman or this distant, brooding god Superman. Batman does NOT kill, even occasionally risking his life to save the lives of criminals...even if he then beats them up and delivers them to the police. Superman is from the Midwest and knows far more about wheat farming than Krypton. Your characters are incredibly violent and quite stupid.

7701288,5,B01D64VSYI,"Whoever decided to decrease the length of this film for whatever reason should be fired. The extended version gives a seamless completeness, greater clarity, and a much more coherent flow to the film. The so-called ""Dream Sequence"" involving Superman and a captive Batman no longer seems to be a last minute insertion that also came off as confusing in the theatrical release. Warner Bros. made a critical mistake and was probably more concerned over how many showings in a day the theatrical release could have compared to the longer version. The end result was the fact that the theatrical release didn't have legs. While it did earn $872 million world wide, this version probably would have made $1.2 billion. The Suicide Squad appears to be following a somewhat similar path but may have better legs and cost $75 million less to make. However, it too was meddled with in the editing room leaving a good deal of ""Joker"" material on the cutting room floor.

A similar error was made by 20th Century Fox when it released Kingdom of Heaven in a version that was nowhere near as good as the Director's Cut available on DVD. Studios should stop worrying about length and concentrate on quality and sensibility. There is nothing more that I can add since B v S has been reviewed ad nauseum. Whether you have seen the theatrical version or not, this is THE one to see. In my humble opinion, it is also far better than Captain America: Civil War.",1472860800,,1441,4.695652173913044

7701295,5,B01D64VSYI,"I love this movie!  I don't write reviews but I just finished watching this movie and I was so excited and amped up I had to a write a review.  Everyone has been saying  this movie was bad, it didn't follow the comics, they botched it, yada yada yada.  I have to say I never saw the theatrical release and never will.  I read someone elses review that said the extended cut made sense and made the movie much better.  So I immediately bought the extended cut and watched it.  I Loved it, except the very end, I mean really.  If you've seen it you know what I'm talking about, if you haven't you should watch it.  This didn't detract from the movie at all and I expect I'll feel better when the next movie comes out, because I mean really.  I'm not going to give any spoilers because amazingly I had not heard anything about the movie unlike star wars that someone ruined the big OMG moment for me.
Anyway, this had action, it had heart, it had very subtle funny moments.  While I watched it, I was like this was better than the first Avengers movie, and I love that one. (Age of Ultron was kinda weak)  I'm sold on the DC comics franchise now, but they had me with Man of Steel really this just solidified it. I like the little teasers of super heroes to come.  I'm still trying to figure out who some of them were. (Not a big comic book fan so I have to do some research)  I don't see how a half hour could ruin this movie, but apparently it did, because I have no complaints.  I even liked Ben Affleck as Batman.  I didn't like that casting at first, but now, yeah I believe it. (He's got some deeeeep issues)  Stop listening to the ridiculous nerdy critics that nit pick every darn thing.  If you like an action movie with good back story and good build up to the action, watch this movie.  In my opinion, this ranks up there with the first Iron man, Batman begins, Winter soldier, Avengers, Matrix, all the really great action movies for people who don't follow the comics.  I love this movie and I'm going to watch it again right now so I can find more nuggets that I missed before!",1472860800,,2087,4.222222222222222
7701296,5,B01D64VSYI,"This film received terrible ratings from critics, but I can't say that I agree. While I am no film expert, this movie has incredibly well-developed characters for the fairly limited screen time each one is allotted, beautiful filming and imagery, an absolutely phenomenal score, and underlying themes on the nature of humanity and morality. Overall, this movie should not be compared to Marvel's Avengers franchise because it is in an entirely different category of cinema; whereas the MCU movies are primarily action films with fun characters bringing them to life, Dawn of Justice (and Man of Steel before it) is almost a statement of literature in the guise of a film--there are subtle hints and literary devices throughout that help to advance the story line and the overarching themes of morality and responsibility in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. This movie is not an action movie, which is part of the reason it did not do well, but it excels as a comic book adaptation that stays true to the ideas of the root material while reinterpreting them in a modern context.",1472860800,,1099,4.945945945945946

7701304,2,B01D64VSYI,"A sloppy way to hint at and force feed heroes into the new justice league movie. This movie could have done without wonder woman.... She helped in the end just as much as batman helped. The motives are unclear for the characters. Batman doesn't like superman because of his power and the destruction of his battles. That's clear. But why does superman want batman to quit? Why does Lex Luthor want superman dead? Why is lex luthor like the joker? It's annoyingly bad.  We have Zack Snyder, the visionary film maker to blame for this.

Batman's scenes are great when he's not killing everyone. Something batman is always against. Even in the dark knight returns comic, where he's driving a tank he refuses to kill any ""mutants"".

7701348,3,B01D64VSYI,"***Spoilers, if you can spoil this movie MORE***
I could go into detail regarding how I would rate the acting, directing, and special effects, but really, the movie as a whole is completely ruined by all the unanswered questions.
- Why is Batman branding criminals? When did this start? There's no background given, so it ends up feeling very out of character, to the point that you might wonder if an imposter is doing the brandings.
- Why does Batman blame Superman for the destruction caused by the battle with Zod? What did he expect Supes to do? Should he have politely asked Zod if they could take their battle to an uninhabited area? Would Bats have preferred that the human race kneel before Zod? It makes Batman seem unreasonable and like he doesn't think things through.
- Why does *reporter* Clark Kent not know who Bruce Wayne is? Is he an idiot? Bruce Wayne is as famous as they come in the DC universe.
- How does Lex figure out our two superheroes' true identities? I realize he's a genius, but wouldn't he have been a more believable threat as a villain if we had seen just how clever he is?
- The whole sequence when Lois gets taken captive in fake Africa is really confusing. Who takes her hostage, and why? It's supposed to be a trap to set up Supes to look like the bad guy, but all he does is rescue Lois. Why is this viewed as such an awful thing for him to have done? And why does this one act get Congress' attention? It would be more believable to have Congress all up in arms over the destruction caused in Metropolis during Man of Steel.
- How does Lex get Zod's ship to do stuff for him? Again, he's a super genius, but it doesn't get addressed at all, and it's very confusing.
- Why does Supes call his own mother by her first name when Batman is about to finish him off? I'll tell you why. It's so we can have the idiotic ""Why did you say that name?"" moment. It only makes sense if you assume the writers felt like their audience is dumb as a box of rocks.
- How was Superman able to fly with the Kryptonite spear in his hand? He was unable to surface from eight feet of water without Lois' help, when he went to retrieve the spear from where Lois had dumped it. He should have flown two feet before flopping to the ground like a wet rag.
- I could go on and on like this, but I'll conclude by saying I came in having very low expectations and was still disappointed. This should have been a really great movie, but instead it was boring and confusing.
P.S. There was only one tiny bit of levity in the whole thing! And we all saw it in the trailer! Jeez, Warner Brothers, lighten up a bit.
P.S. 2: Wonder Woman totally saves Batman and Superman's tushies. I had no particular complaints about her.  Hopefully they don't bungle her standalone movie the way they did with BvS.
P.S. 3: Why bother having Flash and Aquaman in this movie at all? Flash appears to Bruce in a dream (within a dream?) and gives him some totally un-helpful information, and Aquaman appears in a viral video Bruce is watching, where it looks like someone needs to give Jason Momoa some help on how to look like he's not just holding his breath like a common land-dweller.

As much as this movie has been negatively criticized, I consider it to be a really good film. The little things I didn't like from the film weren't even close of being important enough to ruin the experience for me.

Rewatching the film (the ultimate cut) you can see Eisenbergs Lex Luthor becoming more and more absurd and Snyder greedily inserts Batmans and Supermans most iconic moments from the last 30 years into the last 30 minutes of the film and does a disservice to them all. To be fair the final fight scene is spectacular with some emotional beats missing from the rest of the film. All the actors do a good job (its not Eisenbergs fault how Luthor was written) but I came away convinced the Warner Brothers does not understand these characters.

7701402,4,B01D64VSYI,"""Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Society is fearing there should be no Superman because of his alien like actions and Batman is the one who agrees and will also take Superman down. While Superman fears that Batman's actions are wreckless and fearing others, owner of Lex Corp, Lex Luthor is plotting something that will destroy mankind. Will one of the heroes fall or will Lex Luthor take over Metropolis?

The cast led by Ben Affleck (in a solid as usual performance as Batman / Bruce Wayne) & Henry Cavill (also solid as Superman / Clark Kent) is pretty good. The directing by Zack Snyder is pretty good. The story & screenplay (based on the character of Batman created by Bob Kane & Bill Finger and Superman created by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster) by Chris Terrio & David S. Goyer (who also executive produced) is pretty good.

The music by Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL is pretty good. The cinematography by Larry Fong is pretty good. The film editing by David Brenner is pretty good. The casting by Kristy Carlson, Lora Kennedy & Jo Edna Boldin is pretty good. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is pretty good. The art direction by Patricio M. Farrell, Lorin Flemming, Beat Frutiger, Gregory S. Hooper, Kevin Ishioka & Troy Sizemore is pretty good. The set decoration by Carolyn 'Cal' Loucks, set dressings by Derek Berk, Ben Brenner, Celeste Cole, Kemper Harris, Christopher Hayes, Eric Luling, Josh Moceri, Darren Patnode, Sarah M. Schutzki, Scott Schutzki, Christopher M. Settanni, Michael Trosper & David Venezky and set designs by Scott Schneider, David Chow, Erick Donaldson, Timothy M. Earls, Bria Kinter, Jeff Markwith, Anshuman Prasad & Robert Andrew Johnson is pretty good. The costume design by Michael Wilkinson is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Joel Whist is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by David Wallace Allen, John 'D.J.' Des Jardin, Olivier Dumont, Bryan Godwin, Bryan Hirota, Joe Letteri, Keith Miller, Dinesh K.

The stunts coordinated by Damon Caro & Tim Rigby and fights coordinated by Ryan Watson & Guillermo Grispo is pretty good.

This is a pretty good, solid and decently done film that is decently entertaining. Ben Affleck is a solid Batman / Bruce Wayne and Henry Cavill again is solid as Superman / Clark Kent. Gal Gadot is also a solid Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. Zack Snyder has made another solidly crafted film.",1472688000,2,3036,5.116935483870968

This seems to be a very divisive movie and that in and of itself makes me think that it is a noteworthy movie. The intensity and passion of the debate surrounding this movie is awesome. Movies that make you take sides and think deeper and debate choices and get into facebook wars are ones worth watching. There are plenty of safe movies with few faults and no gambles that anyone can enjoy. This is not that movie. Most people seem to either love it or hate it. I find myself loving it.

I saw this opening night at the theater and was highly disappointed, I wrote a bad review for it on fandango and swore that I would never watch Affleck don the Batmans cape again.
But then the ultimate edition came out and myself being a total geek could not resist the temptation so I ordered this.
The ultimate edition is the version that SHOULD have been shown in theaters. I'm not quite sure what exactly changed my view of this movie, maybe it was that the added footage allowed the development to breath a bit more.
My biggest argument when I saw this at the cinema was that there was no humor and that it was dark and dragged way too long. So why does adding 30+ minutes make me suddenly like this movie? I have no idea.
Perhaps this is a personal journey for me I will have to watch again to determine the cause of my change of heart.

The biggest con about this release is that the 3D version is the theatrical cut so I am planning to view this and will update my review accordingly.",1472601600,11,1040,4.2

So in short - (Spoiler alert)

They mixed the plot of several comics, never develop the real story potential of any of them, completely destroyed the Doomsday origins, add a little of the league of justice(to have a entry point pretext for the movie), add a lot of non sense cinematic and action sequences(some of them are really good but some of them are just non sense), and crown with Ben Affleck as Batman (possibly the worst batman ever)",1472601600,,633,4.592920353982301

The brooding/aging Batman character he portrayed was just spectacular. Of course he dominated in this film. I was also quite impressed with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She was very convincing and had great chemistry with Affleck's character-flirting, bordering on provocative. Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane (too young to be Henry Cavill's mom-make up), Holly Hunter, Jesse Eisenberg-all superb!
Maybe the religious undertones in this movie made some feel uncomfortable. It's just fantasy though escalated with conflict and drama. Superman was/is afterall a character based on Jewish angelic and messianic lore (Kal-El-like Elohim, El like God) brought to pop culture by Siegel and Shuster. This is peppered through the movie. If anything you get an idea of Superman's origin in a very entertaining way. If you're a DC fan you'll love it.",1472601600,3,1024,5.327160493827161

7701426,1,B01D64VSYI,"Mostly just out of morbid curiosity, I finally wasted 3 HOURS AND 3 MINUTES of my life watching Batman vs. Supermanarguably one of the lousiest films I've ever seen in my 48 years, and definitely the worst big box superhero film I've ever viewed.

One-dimensional story (if we can even call it that); flat characters with none of the ironic complexities we've come to expect in comic book movies in the past decade; implausible acting even for extras in a crowd (yes, the guests at the library fundraiser had wince-worthy unrealistic reactions, ranging from amusement to nonchalant acceptance, to a creepster weirdo supposed philanthropist like Jesse Eisenberg's LuthorI guess their faces are supposed to read ""Well, he's really rich, so I guess he's OK""); SO many lost opportunities for intriguing twists and both story and character arcs...it's almost impossible to catalogue just how bad this movie is. Certainly lots of interesting and arresting visual detailsso this is now understandable to me as a film only a DC fanatic could love (in the sense, of course, that only a mother could love a certain kind of child).

And only in a country where Donald Trump could become one of two major presidential candidates could a flick like this enter even the periphery of cultural acceptability and worthiness.  The crappy character, caliber, and shallowness of Trump even seems to manifest a bit in that of Bruce Wayne: ""Superman is a total loser, and therefore I have to wipe him out,"" Wayne basically seems to say.

Too bad, too, because Ben Affleck wasn't really terrible , and Gal Gadot looks promising as the kickass Amazon princess I grew up with admiring. I want to be gracious and allow that Affleck got hijacked by a rotten script, except that this guy co-won a bloody Oscar for Best Original Screenplay! (He really should know better!) Leading me, naturally, to conclude for a final time that Matt Damon was the main writer of Good Will Hunting and Affleck was brought along through buddy love alone.

I really don't know what they had in mind even releasing that version. But if you want to watch this movie, then do yourself a favor and get the Extended Edition. If not, the story really makes no sense at all. Also as an added note, this is one of the darker movies in this series. Ben Affleck does a good job in his role as the Batman. As does Henry Cavill as Superman. Lastly, don't miss the very last frame of the movie, right before the credits.

7701442,3,B01D64VSYI,"Heres the short of it, if you just want to know the pithy gist of this review and move on: Batman vs. Superman offers plenty of giddy excitement, a brutal new take on Batman, and a glorious, if all too brief, debut of Wonder Woman.  Those elements make it a must-see.  But it is hammered with villainous booby traps and smart bombs flung not by the villains of the movie, but by its director, Zach Snyder.

If thats all you need to hear to decide whether or not to see BvS, you're good to go.  If you love thundering spectacle and don't want to think too much about plot, if you are one of the masses not interested in comic book canon, go and enjoy.  If you are a rabid comic fan, theres no way you are not going to see this anyway, even knowing it will skewer your soul.  Im a long-time fan boy, and if you want to see this movie get a fair trial, read on.

Everything has been stacked against it; for over a year now, with each leaked image and rumor, critics and sneering internet movie trolls have been sharpening their knives.  I cannot remember a movie that so many people wanted to fail before its release.  And indeed, many vicious reviews have sprung up like weeds in the old vacant lot of the internet.  Some critics just cant accept that the superhero genre is here to stay, in all its myriad forms, like Westerns (which gave us plenty of schlocky oaters but some incredibly artful films).  Some just love feeding the notion that there is a war between Disney/Marvel and Warner Brothers/DC, and that Marvel reigns victorious.  Some, to quote lovable old Alfred, just want to watch the world burn.  I hate that Zach Snyder has given them all a lot of ammunition to burn through.  But there are great things at work here that can offer some hope.  Snyder has not killed the DC Universe before it even got started; but he will be painted the villain here, and like most comic book villains, he hamstrings our heroes throughout their battle.

The main flaw of BvS, and for diehard fans there are many, is the central conceit of the film; that two highly intelligent and powerful men need to come to blows over a misunderstanding.  Batman, also known as the worlds greatest detective, would have seen the bigger picture in how Supermans existence is playing out among Earths humans.  Hes astute enough to find kryptonite and alter it into a giant krypto-spear, but cant see the man is methodically bring framed by Lex Luthor, who makes plenty of not-so-subtle waves in building a covert army bent on creating terrorist actions around the world and blaming them on Superman?  Really, they just needed a chat over a latte.  But then Snyder doubles down on the silliness of the conflict by ending it withmommy issues?  Maybe this is why, even back in 1938 and 1940, the creators of Superman and Batman gave their mothers the same name, Martha.  Suddenly they're deep friends.  The fight was unearned, and the end of the fight was even more unearned.  Fans of these heroes and their long-running team-up series, Worlds Finest, know that these two are often at odds with each other, but the conflict is always in their particular style of meting justice; Ben Afflecks Batman is brutal, which certainly gives the Boy Scout-whizness of Superman reason to want to put a stop to him.  But they both work outside the law, and BvS does a nice job of setting up the questions of not whether Superman can act on his authority, but whether he should be allowed to.

It is Superman who gets the short shrift here, as he is built up in a God/Savior complex but not given any story elements that offer him a chance to address that; his only attempt to address the people at a Senate committee hearing ends with a big bang before hes uttered a word.  In the real world, Superman would have a PR team addressing his every move.  Lois would have it no other way.

Snyder layers on the religious allegories even more thickly than in Man of Steel, where he was comically framed in a church with Jesus stained glass aglow behind him.  The hidden and obvious crosses (you may gag when you see the utility pole crosses near the end), the outstretched crucified-pose arms, the expressions of suffering and redemption all serve to suffocate the mightiest man alive, and his hang-dog martyrdom is only briefly relieved when he mirthfully jumps in a bath with Lois, but we miss it because Snyder angles the camera downward to Lois nude body and were too busy trying score a glimpse of Amy Adams side-boob.

Zach Snyder also just cannot help himself with dream sequences and flashbacks; the movie posts them like stop signs in a suburban neighborhood.  It has been a gaping flaw in every one of his films with the exception of Dawn of the Dead, and he puffs up these visions with visual grandeur and no net, the most ludicrous being that Batman trips on a vision of some apocalyptic future where Superman rules a fascist army of soldiers and alien bugs (which are  clearly supposed to be Darkseids parademon minions, but Batman would have no way of knowing that).

Hans Zimmers thunder-boom soundtrack hits you over the head constantly like an annoying monkey with a gong.  With all the calamitous action unfolding, the music needed to provide underscoring, not OVERscoring.  It is non-stop sonic jackhammering to the temple with few breaks; and its LOUD.  Im hoping the theatre in which I saw the screener was an anomaly, for your sake.

I can layer on thickly the plot elements that make no sense, Jesse Eisenbergs baffling, tic-heavy take on Lex Luthor and his unexplained motivations, his apparent discovery and tracking of the hidden meta-humans of the world (who will become members of the Justice League) and his ability to give them LOGOS.  Luthors attempts to frame Superman for terrorist acts make no logical sense.  Lois Lane devolves quickly from intrepid reporter in the beginning (in a tense little scene in North Africa) to damsel-in-distress.  Why do we have to sit through yet another visualization of Bruce Waynes dreamy reliving of his parents murder?  Was this not rule #01 for the reboot of Batman:  no origin story.  Holly Hunters Senator Finch is supposed to be the conscience of America, but is offed just when the argument gets started.

So, whats good?

Thank Zeus that in the aftermath of the boys pissing match and the reveal of the big bad, Doomsday, the long-reclusive jet-setting (in coach!) Diana Prince comes to her senses and jumps into the fray as Wonder Woman.  Its a glorious moment that resulted in the biggest cheers of the night, and rightfully so; Gal Gadots take on the Amazonian is deliriously splendid.  As over the top as the boys are, shes a direct bullet to getting things done, from her classic shield and sword to that golden lasso.  Shes not given any backstory or even much context to work with other than her bad-assery, but I could have watched two and a half hours of her kicking everyones ass.  We are salivating for the Wonder Woman movie.

As Batman, Ben Affleck shows promise; his take is based on the older, wizened Batman of Frank Millers popular 80s dark reimagining of the character.  Affleck fills out the pumped-up suit well enough, and makes a convincing Bruce Wayne, and the new tech is very exciting.  The Batmobile is an amped-up version of the Tumbler, his Batcave is just about perfect, and his suits are an espresso-machine shy of Iron Mans.  He swings about on his grappling gun as he does in the terrific Arkham Knight video games, and his fights are the best weve seen; his takedown of an army of Luthors thugs is one of the movies highlights and gives us a glimpse of what this Batman can be in his own movies.  Jeremy Irons, as our new Alfred, is perfectly world-weary.  His Alfred isn't just there to dispense wisdom and press pants; hes smart and hes indispensable; we would love to see more of him.

It was always going to be a thankless and unforgiving task bringing the Justice League into a film universe; Batman and Superman are originals, far more iconic than any Marvel heroes, most of whom are derivatives of the original DC heroes.  The DC world has almost always been heavier, darker, laden with higher stakes, more vicious criminals and religious allegory.  Despite the misfires here, Snyder has assembled a cast thats near-perfect.  The trinity of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman looks and feels right.  The production, effects, costumes and tech are exactly what they should be.  Snyder and writer Chris Terrio have promised a less somber Justice League, so lets hope the critical smackdown they receive from Dawn of Justice will have them considering Jokers mantrawhy so serious?",1472515200,,8650,4.669306930693069

7701449,5,B01D64VSYI,"The Ultimate Edition addresses almost every issue I had with the theatrical version of Dawn of Justice (unfortunately yes, the ""Martha"" scene is still there, which is the first thing my guy friends wanted to know).

It fleshes out Clark's story much more to give him a legitimate reason to fight Batman, as well as making Lex's machinations more obvious and less ""who was that person again?"". All of this makes their showdown seem inevitable but also much more satisfying, as events are given the chance to build upon each other and it's easier to see why each character would risk defeat (or in Clark's case, his conscience) to defend against the danger of an unchecked ""superhero"".

I agree with the other reviewer who felt that THIS should have been the theatrical version - the story makes much greater sense and is indeed epic as a whole.

My only complaint is the digital version - I was unable to get it to work on my laptop, which is where I really wanted a copy due to not having a built-in DVD player, and the entire process was extremely frustrating. Something about my brand-spanking new HP Spectre's monitor not being rated to play copyrighted material. The expletives that followed would have garnered an R rating just like the movie. However, I did manage to get it on my phone...where it took up a ton of space and was completely useless thanks to the small screen.

7701512,3,B01D64VSYI,"Amazing cast, and the movie certainly had its strong points.

The Good:

- It's nice to see more Batman and Superman, especially in the same movie.

- Wonder Woman: I've never been a fan, but Gal Gadot really made the character believable and entertaining. Great job!

- Jeremy Irons (Alfred): Irons is always awesome, and doesn't disappoint. I wish he'd had more screen time.

- The Batmobile: Pretty cool, but significantly less so than Nolan's Tumbler. Then again, that's a pretty high bar.

The Bad:

- Who calls their mom ""Martha?""

- I love Jesse Eisenberg, but, really - a lot of dialogue sounded like it was written by a 7th grader doing fan fiction. Forced is putting it lightly.

- What was up with that guy in the plastic suit and swirly particle effects? If you can say ""You were right about him,"" maybe you can say who ""him"" is? I mean, really: if you're going to try and send a message from the future, rehearse it, maybe get a focus group (ie, Anyone Else Ever, also know as proofreading)). This was an annoying and nonsensical moment, clearly put there to tie in to the upcoming  Justice League franchise that DC is hoping will compete with, or at least ride on the coattails of, Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Sorry, but it should've been left on the editing room floor.

- I just don't buy Ben Affleck as a murdering vigilante. Also, Batman's never been one to run around shooting up innocent bystanders and, if he was, it doesn't really give him a lot of room to complain about the Kryptonian's rampage in New York (which is apparently now also Metropolis, finally, though they break continuity by putting it so far from Kansas).

The Ugly:

- The Flash's costume. Really, the one used in the CW's ""The Flash"" is orders-of-magnitude better (and half of its episodes are better than this film). This looked like a bunch of spray-painted dixie cups put together by a crafts-obsessed grandmother.

- Plot holes galore. See the How It Should Have Ended: Batman vs Superman for many examples.

- So much more, but I'm avoiding spoilers.

Given the lackluster efforts applied to DC's other properties - though I love ""The Flash,"" giant talking gorillas and talking shark-headed men aren't all that convincing and, really, Legends of Tomorrow should be a web series - I'm not not super-surprised at  how this turns out. Still, Man of Steel was so great that I hoped for something a *little* better.

7701539,2,B01D64VSYI,"If you liked Zack Snyders ""Man of Steel"", then be prepared to be disappointed by a movie that's a huge step down in quality (Frankly I liked that movie until the last 10 minutes which just turned into a giant yawn inducing mess of CGI explosions).

The Pro's:
Actually shows the consequences of said CGI destruction from the first movie which is what motivates Bruce Wayne to want to ""protect"" the earth from Superman.
It does look rather good in parts, filmed with a real definite tone (moody and broody).
Batman kicks ass, he really does.  Ben Affleck does a great job and brings us a true ""dark knight"" who is no longer a hero, but a vigilante ....

The Cons:
The script is terrible.... seriously, they could have left it simple with Bruce Wayne hating Superman for the destruction he brought to earth and it's consequences.  It would have worked.  Instead then we have to throw in Lex Luthor, a terrible CGI looking foe, Wonder Woman, some sort of vision from the future which then becomes a vision sent ""from"" the future by a time traveling cyborg who may not have time traveled with a vision from the future and in all fact could have been a dream or was it............  confused yet?  You will be....
It comes across like DC comics just using this movie as an excuse to introduce a bunch of superhero's who honestly, you just don't care about and don't actually add anything to the movie anyway (so why bother?).
Wonder Woman... yes she's in this, and no one can figure out why.... probably just to add a mini skirt to the end CGI mess of destruction.
Oh yes, another movie ending in an overly long CGI laden, eye rolling battle.
Lex Luthor..... what happened to having a bad guy that is dangerous because he's fiercely intelligent and driven... instead we're just given some over the top camera mugging from a character that seems to rely more on luck than an actual well put together plan.
Then... there's the Batman...  Oh yes, make no mistake, Ben Affleck makes a GREAT Batman!  He can act the part, he fits the suit well and he's darker and move driven than any other previous incarnation.  So what's the problem?  Well Batman goes from being a realistic superhero back to almost comic book Tim Burton style.  Watch as he crawls around a ceiling like a poorly rendered CGI rat defying physics, watch as they try to up the ante of all previous Bat mobile chases...... by taking huge steps backwards with gravity defying, poorly edited and once again CGI destruction that removes any possibility of the suspension of disbelief.... or is it now suspension of belief because it's so unbelievable.... ok, now I'm more confused than this movies script...
Wonder Woman... she doesn't have a lot to say or do in this movie.......... and when she does finally speak, it sounds like she could use a wheel barrow to help deliver her lines.  I don't blame Gal Gadot for this though, I just blame the lack of direction and lack of a script.

Overall, this should and could have been a better movie.  The fans deserved something so much better and non fans should have been entertained also.  However somewhere in the mix, someone decided ""We need to throw in more superheros so we can do spin off movies"", ""We need to have bigger explosions"", ""Batman can't just hate Superman because he's responsible for the death of Wayne Employee's, lets get a time traveling cyborg bring him a vision of an apocalyptic future and then edit the whole thing to look like a dream within a dream sequence"", ""Let's also throw in Lex Luthor"", ""Let's forget this is Batman Vs Superman and make it Batman Vs Superman for about 5 minutes and then it becomes Batman & Superman & Wonder Woman Vs some giant CGI monster!"", ""Oh and then let's kill Superman.... but have him come back to life!... only to kill him again... and then tease at him not really being dead.... again..."".

This movie is a giant mess, no doubt about that, but no doubt people will want to watch it in hopes that every bad review out there is wrong and it's actually a great movie.  Don't worry, you've probably watched the trailers for ""Dawn Of Justice"" and ""Wonder Woman"" and thought ""Wow, I really hope these are going to be good movies and nowhere near the mess Batman Vs Superman is....."".

If WB had had the nerve to release the three-hour cut into theatres in the first place, I cannot believe the reviews (or audience reaction) would have been nearly so bad. Instead of a 27% Rotten Tomatoes rating, it would be more around 56%.

No version of this movie was ever going to be an unqualified smash hit that everybody loves. There are too many problems with the storyline and dialogue. But at least the Ultimate Edition cut has a naturalistic pace to it. It's a slow pace, by all means, but it feels artistically ""right"".

I'm not a big believer in the ""haters"" concept. People don't just wake up one day and decide to hate something. Most people who hate this movie have understandable reasons. And most people who like it, generally, have to explain why. All I can say is, you have to consciously TRY to like this movie. If you can do that, you will have an exciting, thrilling, and thought-provoking experience. But that is not the same as a movie that simply astounds you from the moment you lay eyes on it.

I was told by other people when the film released that it wasn't good and I waited for it to go to DVD and went into it with pretty low expectations. I think overall this was a great film and I was very surprised. I loved that they used so many of batman's gadgets and some of his scenes felt like they were ripped right out of the video games.

(Warning: Potential Spoilers)

Okay.

So, this film has received some pretty mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes has given it a 29%, yet the audience score is 73%. Metacritic gave it a 44%, yet the audience score is also a 73%. On average, superhero movies receiving a 70 is good, 80 means it is great, 50/60 is average, and anything below that is a disappointment. In other words, the critics are saying it's a massive disappointment, and the users are saying this was a decent, well made film.

So now the question is this: who's right? After seeing the film, I've come to a conclusion.

Poor consistency, odd changes to iconic characters, confusion in moral philosophy across all characters (Superman and Batman alike), bad scripting, lack of character backstory, and a lack of reasonable explanation behind character motives amidst so much explanation and dialogue made me absolutely hate this film.

However...

The amazing visual style, great acting, fascinating moral and philosophical discussion within the political world, beautifully choreographed action, epic music, jaw dropping cinematography, refreshingly dark tone, and a feeling of ""stuff is going down!"" the entire film made me absolutely love this film.

I've never been this split on a movie, ever. At times I wanna yell in Snyder's face and say ""what the frick were you thinking"" and then immediately after shake his hand and say ""incredible, simply incredible"". Sometimes I wonder if Snyder enjoys making his fans fight each other over his films. Man of Steel is a classic example of this. Batman v Superman will undoubtedly be the same.

Ill start with the biggest problem: THE FREAKING LACK OF ANY BACKSTORY.

DC should NEVER have come out with this film this early. Now that Nolan's Batman is non-Canon in the new DC cinematic universe, they had to retell Batman's entire story in this film, AGAIN. There's no time for that. You're trying to make sense out of character motives when we are, theoretically, totally unaware of the moral beliefs of these characters, like Batman. How can we understand his reasoning to bring down Superman if we don't even understand him as a person? We needed a Batman film WELL before this film. Throughout the entire film, maybe he occasionally hears mention of Superman. He does get on the News several times in Man of Steel. Then, at the end of the Batman movie, after all the story of what makes Batman Batman and his upbringing and moral philosophy, and after he takes down some kingpin or something like that, he sees across the bay Zods ship crashing into Metropolis. It shows him angry, shocked, upset, staring across the bay, and then it ends. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT SETUP FOR BATMAN V SUPERMAN. PERFECT. Did they do that? No. Here's Bruce just suddenly running in the middle of the city out of nowhere. It didn't make sense. If they had added that ending to the Batman film, that alone would have been enough to get people excited for this film, and, at the very least, make sense to the viewership and make the opening scene to the movie even more epic. Then add a Wonder Woman origin story to the mix, just to whet the appetites of the fans. After that, come out with a Suicide Squad movie as a separate entity to remember there are other characters in this universe outside of the ones that we will see in this film (similar to Guardians of the Galaxy). Then, and only then, is this film allowed to come out. But no. They didn't do that. The best word to describe this entire film, even with its surprising amount of successes, is ""forced"". Just, forced. DC is trying SO HARD to catch up with Marvel, but they need to realize that what Marvel has done so well is theyve taken their time with each film, so that our excitement for the Avengers only grows and grows until it finally releases. From here on out, no superhero mash up films for DC until we have had a sufficient amount of preparation to proceed them. Bad DC, bad!

The other problems with this film are honestly not that big of a deal in comparison. The problem mentioned before is by far the most glaring and obvious issue. It could have solved a lot of the existing problems within the script and outline as a whole. One issue is that we received a HORRIBLE version of Lex Luther. People keep saying that he was ""miss cast"". No. He was PERFECTLY cast, the issue is how Lex Luther was written. He's supposed to be a soft spoken, demanding, manipulative, and creepy. Lex Luther in this film was written to be an awkward, uncomfortable, quirky, semi-manipulative, whiny rich kid. Jesse Eisenberg was a perfect choice for this. Don't believe me? Go see The Social Network, where he plays essentially the same character. He's amazing in it. The problem, once again, comes down to the script; it comes down to the way Lex Luther was written. The writers got his character completely wrong. At the very least, it's just a weird way to write the villain. He's such an odd side show to the main characters. Another problem in the film was that NO ONE KNOWS BATMANS MORAL CODE. He kills SO many people. Granted, he doesnt take a gun and shoot men in point blank range, but he does blow cars up with guns and bullets and men are inside them and there is NO WAY that they survived. What the crap happened to Batmans moral code? Oh wait, we don't know because we NEVER SAW AN ORIGIN STORY EXPLAINING HIS MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL CODE. Characters make choices in this film as though we already know what drove them to that choice, but the film hasn't had enough backstory in the universe for us to actually know. Beyond that, theres too much talking and although I liked the moral and philosophical discussion, there becomes a time when you care more about understanding the PLOT then the RATIONALE. So many God references to Superman its unreal.

Okay. Those are the negatives. Now for the positives.

The cinematography, direction, editing, effects, acting; nearly everything in this film beyond the writing is TOP NOTCH. One thing I absolutely loved was the music. The MUSIC! It was incredible. I will go on record and say that this is the finest mix of Superhero music ever in the history of superhero films, period. I dare you to prove me wrong. The themes in this film are so clever, epic, and emotional. I wanted to just stand up and start clapping because of the music alone. Beyond music, The production value was simply just amazing. So many times I got teary eyes, or got goosebumps from the several emotional and epic scenes. Frankly, I couldn't believe the way I was feeling. I was genuinely shocked. After complaining in my head because of several scenes that were just dumb, my emotional strings continued to get pulled against my will. Often critics say the best way to judge a film is to just listen to your own emotions. This filmed scared me, disturbed me, saddened me, psyched me, and chuckled me throughout. I was amazed. No Marvel film has ever done that in one film over and over again. Ever. EVER. The dark tone in this film was also extremely refreshing. After experiencing the constant laughs and endless smiles of the Marvel films, it was extremely refreshing to actually be sad or to jump from being scared or to simply watch a serious movie with few jokes. Many of the shots were in slow motion or carried the superheros in specific, epic poses that just looked BA to watch. At the end, when they all fight Doomsday, you cant help but love it. Finally, after all this fighting and snickering and trouble brewing, the group lines up together to take on a single, unified threat. It was purely epic. Pure cinema.

Also, notably, Ben Affleck is amazing as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His anger, and staunch look, while simultaneously keeping up appearances with the crowds, was perfect. Is this better than Christian Bale? Ill wait to see the actual Batman film before I make that determination, but it is to be noted no matter how you compare the actors, the characters they portray are inherently different. Afflecks Batman is much more willing to HURT villains then Bales ever was. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was also fantastic. She was mysterious, sly, mischievous, and confident. When Wonder Woman shows up to help Batman and Superman against Doomsday, I literally out loud yelled Yeah! Lets go! Because it was just so awesome seeing her beside the other two fighting a common foe. This film certainly doesnt fail at making you love the teamwork. If it failed at that, this film would be useless.

This film is honestly how Ive always wanted superhero movies and movies in general to be. Serious, semi-dark, hints of moral ambiguity, philosophical discussions, and epic. And it was certainly that last one. The effects were great. Yeah, okay, Doomsdays CGI was slightly odd, but you cant tell me that Ultron wasn't a little odd looking or perhaps an even better example is the few times weve seen Thanos and how he looks. Everything here in terms of production was amazing, and Snyder should be applauded for how ambitious this film was and how he managed to turn what could have been an absolutely abysmal film into a decent one.

What will determine if you like this film is whether you like a darker design. Do you like the serious tone? Do you like Batman killing people? Do you prefer sadness over comedy? For most people, Marvel will be preferred, but frankly, Im MUCH more excited for this franchise then Marvel because its going down the road Ive always wanted Superheros to go. This film isn't the perfect example that I wanted, but its on the right track. Yeah there are some SERIOUS problems that DC needs to hammer out. Theyve got to earn these superhero mash ups by providing the necessary background for these characters before they can make their millions. But regardless, I see value in the film, and considering this is just the beginning, hope prevails.

If we see a movie in this franchise that DOES have good writing, and has this dark tone, and an equivalent production design that this film portrayed, then it could end up being my favorite superhero movie ever, right next to The Dark Knight. Is this film it? No. Not by a long shot. But Im excited for the day that they do make it. Because I truly believe they will.

It was that awful. The writing is over-the-top campy to the point of hack, the intelligence level of the intended audience must have been ""moron,"" several decent actors put in unbelievably awful performances, and even the sync on the sound didn't line up occasionally on dialog. I just saw there is an ""extended director's cut"" for this pile of crap. Someone should have taken about 20 minutes out of the theater release. I can't imagine why anyone would want to suffer more of this idiocy. In case you are wondering, my wife kept saying ""I told you so"" throughout the movie, since she had seen trailers and already knew it was a loser.

7701590,3,B01D64VSYI,"Batman v Superman is a competent movie.  There just isn't a great deal to like about the movie.  I was not able to see the movie in a theater before it ended its theatrical run.  Shortly after the movie came out digitally, I saw the movie for the first time & realized there was also the Ultimate Edition.  It took some time with my Internet signal crashing on me to watch the three hour version of the movie.  If you see a Superman movie, you expect to root for Superman.  If you see Batman vs the bad guys, you expect them to be rounded up for the police and not slaughtered.  Gal Gadot is featured in cover art as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince but gets to say almost nothing in the movie.  She looks great as Wonder Woman.  There is just so much death and destruction running rampant through the movie, it becomes more mind-numbing than a gory horror movie.  I never thought of Ben Affleck as Batman but he showed potential for other Batman movies.
This movie throws a great deal of information at you without bothering to explain things.  You never find out why Lex Luthor was keeping track of meta-humans or how he found out who Batman and Superman really are.  Jimmy Olsen is brought in at beginning of movie only to be killed for what point exactly?  Why even name the character Jimmy Olsen?  I never realized before that both Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent both had mothers named Martha.  There is no light in all the darkness that is this movie.

I don't understand what the critics are talking about I thought it was a good movie and look forward to watching it again. I think this is a case of people jumping on the bandwagon and are going along with the critics. Maybe I need to watch it a second time. I don't get the joyless criticism...there are not to many Batman movies I come skipping out of due to joy. I think Batman and Superman were played well, both characters are struggling with internal conflicts.

The thing that I think critics should be complaining about and I think it is kind of minor is that non-comic book readers may have felt a little lost with some references (not key story elements) but other than that I think it was a good movie. I watched the movie with a non-comic book fan and I had to explain the Apocalypse, Darkseid, Parademons and Flash cameo. The critics are complaining about the wrong thing!

I missed that and was half way through the movie in 3D trying to figure out what was better about it before carefully reading the box again and seeing that Ultimate Edition is only on the 2D disc.  Maybe my bad, but that detail should be front and center on the package, because when you buy 3D Ultimate Edition, you are expecting the feature edition is the one in 3D.  Movie was 4+ stars for me, but dropped rating to 3 due to the frustrating marketing and the 3D version being only the theatrical version.  With that said, the Ultimate Edition (2D) really helps to clear up some confusing and senseless scenes in the movie, such as why people were against Superman after the desert events near the beginning, where in the theatrical version, you see some guy outside shoot a few other guys, and then Superman apparently kills a single militant leader that is holding a gun to Lois's head.  Why would that be a problem???  The Ultimate edition adds enough additional details to see why people maybe thought superman did a little bit more of the personal vengeance thing.  So I, along with multiple other reviewers, am now asking why the crappy edit was released to the theaters instead of the slightly longer version that added considerable more sense to the story.",1472256000,4,1443,4.66798418972332

7701654,2,B01D64VSYI,"I look at movies as whether I would get my money's worth.  This was a $1.99 movie.

It put style over substance.  They have chosen to be ""dark"" and serious over everything else.  They kind of forget that the basis of heroism is light.  They also have confused dark and realism.  There's nothing inspiring here and a lot of inconsistencies.  (mild spoiler alert) Batman now shoots guns.  What's the point to throwing a batarang; wouldn't he just have a lot of guns?  If Superman can move at speeds faster than thought, why throw Batman around, why now just end it?  Lex Luthor is portrayed as a mad clown; there's no logic to what he does.  Joker in the Bale Batman movie at least had a certain sense to him - he was mad and wanted anarchy.

Good science fiction sets some ground rules and works off logic after that.  The Bale movies and to a large extent the Marvel movies do that.  But what sets the Marvel movies apart is that the characters have personality: Thor, Tony Stark, Loki, Hawkeye, Antman, Quill etc.  This new age of DC just has a bunch of scowling bores.

I really think out of all the different Batman actors, he fit the character the best. Gritty and honor-bound. It did feel a bit choppy at times, a little disconnected, hence 4 stars.

7701709,2,B01D64VSYI,I watched this on the plane.  It is the worst Batman movie and I am a huge Batman fan.,1471996800,,86,3.526315789473684
7701710,1,B01D64VSYI,"First of all, Superman is my favorite comicbook character and I've been a DC fan forever, I own nearly every Superman/Batman movie (even the bad ones) and watched Smallville religiously. This movie however just isn't the direction I wanted to see the DCCU go and it can't quite make up it's mind on if it wants to be based in reality or fantasy.

I was skeptical about this movie ever since it was announced, especially since it was being pitched as a sequel to Man of Steel (which I didn't love). I figured I'd give it a shot though maybe it would be alright but after seeing reviews I decided to wait for it to come out on DVD/Blu-ray. After several months it came out on Blu-ray and I finally decided to buy it when it was on sale and see if it was as bad as the reviews said. I figured most of the reviews said they felt like it was missing parts so I'd just go straight to the extended cut and maybe it wouldn't be so bad but I was wrong.

First, this movie doesn't know where it wants to take place, in reality of fantasy. Half the time physics function how they do in our world and the other half the time they don't. I can't quite put my finger on it but you just can't follow these fights as they're pretty laughable but I suppose that's how it goes when you're putting an indestructible man/woman with a mortal Batman.

Second, there's just too many ideas all jumbled up in this movie. You can tell Zack Snyder had a truckload of ideas for this movie and wanted to cram them all in because the studio told him they just wanted one movie and not two. Things feel rushed, jumbled together, and sometimes even confusing and you jump back and forth between one idea and the next. You can't even really know what's happening or who everyone is unless you're a true comicbook/cartoon fan which leaves a lot of people out of the loop.

Third, there are SO many pointless scenes that are just in there to lead into the Justice League movie. This movie is more than anything just a 3 hour long trailer for the Justice League movie that's coming up. You can tell WB/DC are really trying to catch up to Marvel and cash in on The Avengers idea. The scenes are just there; there's no point to them and there's absolutely no explanation as to why they're happening. Okay cool I saw some other DCU characters but why did I see them? Can they at least put some dialogue here please?

Lastly, where the heck is the action!? There's literally like 20 minutes worth of action in this movie and most of it isn't anything we haven't seen before. Even watching the extended cut seemed like most of the movie was just lead up to a massively disappointing battle with the plot point that ends the battle being easily one of the biggest cinematic flops I've ever witnessed.

Overall the on sale price I paid for this movie was maybe fair for 3 hours of dull entertainment but I'm so happy I didn't pay full price or see this in theaters. If you like story even a little bit you won't like this movie as there's absolutely none to be found and if you like Marvel movies you're going to be sorely let down. I'd just wait a few months for this to go onto Amazon Prime as it didn't take long for it to go on sale.",1471996800,,3194,4.271074380165289
7701711,3,B01D64VSYI,"Marvel makes it look so effortless. For an action movie, the first 3/5 was so incredibly boring. I can think of one scene that didn't belong in this movie, it seemed. The final 40% was a little more enjoyable with some action. All in all, there was no VERSUS in BM v SM. One hero was completely owned by the other.",1471996800,,314,4.163934426229508

7701713,3,B01D64VSYI,"If you are going to see this movie, then make sure you see the Extended Edition.  It is far better than the theatrical version.  It makes a disappointing movie at least watchable.  I went into this movie with low expectations, after reading all the negative reviews.  It wasn't near as bad as I had heard, but I can understand why people didn't like it.  Terrible directing and bad villains nearly sunk this movie. ** SPOILERS AHEAD ** The very worst thing about this movie is the main villain.  OMG.  They don't even give you Lex Luthor.  Nope, they give you Lex Luthor's son, which is horribly over played by Jesse Eisenberg.  I like him as an actor, but someone forgot to mention to him that he's not the freaking Joker.  That's what you got.  That's where some of the bad directing comes in.  Zach Snyder should have sat him down and told him to tone it down a bit.  Instead, he let him try and channel Heath Ledger's Joker.  It fails on every level.  He really hates Superman though.  Why?  Who knows.  We are never given any real reason why. so he's a nut case without any real motivation.  Doesn't work.  Which brings me to my next subject, the directing.  There are some major plot holes in this movie that look to me as a clear case of director laziness.  The entire motivation for the Batman/Superman fight is nonsensical.  One little sentence from Superman would have stopped the fight.  He doesn't say it.  Why?  It's because Snyner is a lazy director who couldn't come up with anything better.  There are other such moments in the movie where a normal common sense person would have said a phrase or two, that would have made a difference, but didn't.  That's just lazy film making.  Then he decides to change the entire character of Batman.  He's literally a killer now.  --eyes rolling.  One of the things that made Batman great was his absolute rule of not taking a life.  That's what made him so interesting.  Zach Snyder decided to remove that and go the Deadpool route.  Bad move.  Of course, the movie also has some good things going for it too.  I really liked Jeremy Irons as Alfred.  Lois Lane was great.  She actually contributed a lot to the story instead of just being a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued.  Ben Afflec did a pretty good job as Bruce Wayne.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The fight scenes were terrific.  The Batman fight scenes were very well done as was the battle vs Superman.  The Doomsday fight was just MEH.  It was just an explosion of CGI al-la-Transformers.  Henry Cavill is a great Superman, so no complaints there either.  Wonder Woman gets an A+ from me.  Gal Gadot really nailed that part.  Overall though, this isn't a great movie.  Just a good one.  Not even in the same class as the Captain America movies.  Hopefully DC gets their act together and starts putting out better films.",1471996800,5,2844,4.541666666666667
7701714,4,B01D64VSYI,"More of an opinion-piece rather than a review, the following will likely ramble... Bottom line: Whether the theatrical or extended/original cut of this film, director Snyder forgot that the great majority of moviegoing audiences are unfamiliar with comic book canon, graphic novelizations of characters, or specific narrative arcs. In other words, he appeals to die-hard comic book fans, and said fans make up a fraction of film audiences. Thus, among other scenes, the Batman nightmare-slash-prophetic visions sequences would make absolutely no sense to the uninitiated. Nor would the appearance of Darkseid minion Steppenwolf with Mother Boxes, standing before Luthor. That said, the extended cut certainly fills in many of the narrative holes, particularly Luthor's motivation. Glad to see Cavill's Clark/Superman get more screen time and here too, more of a story to support motivation. I'm a Wonder Woman fan since 1968, and Gadot is well cast as Diana. I enjoyed the mystery built around her character. As others have pointed out, it seems illogical that, if she left man's world behind due to, well, disgust, then why care if Luthor has a photograph of her from 1918? Well, clearly she hasn't completely left man's world -- perhaps she merely ceased assisting humankind. Via the video surveillance footage, she clearly maintains a bank account, has loot as her obviously expensive clothing indicates, and is very aware she is being watched (in both video and still camera surveillance she stares directly at the camera lens). At the museum reception, a museum curator knows her well enough to wish to show her the 'sword of Alexander,' which supports the notion that she operates as an antiquities expert or dealer. She outwits Batman twice, and wants him to know she has done so -- thus, it's not a stretch to believe she is aware that Bruce is Batman, and likely too, that Clark is Superman. She is, after all, semi-divine. And so it is also not a stretch to believe that she is less concerned with Luthor's possession of the photo per se, and likely more concerned with being traced to Themyscira. We now know from the WW trailer that the Amazons battle an army of men on their home soil, and the memory of that surely has scarred Diana. Affleck makes for a great Batman. Personally I like the character portrayed as a ruthless vigilante -- the fight scenes were fantastic and I have zero problem with Batman flat out killing criminal scum. That he will pull back to less violent means of meting out justice thanks to Clark's and Diana's influences is clear. But I enjoyed the ride of brutality nonetheless. Indeed, I don't have a problem with characters taking on new nuances, or picking up characterizations from more arcane iterations... thus, if Luthor is a shrill, whiny psychopath, possibly on the verge of possession by Darkseid -- or sensitive to his influence -- then so be it. I think it's high time for a fresh look at these comic book icons. Superheroes are no different than ancient gods and heroes -- the stories change depending on who is telling them. These figures are fiction and in turn naturally open to interpretation -- no different than ancient tales of Zeus and Co., which differ from era to era and region to region. Still, the film is flawed -- crammed with plots and subplots and characters, it is not the best example of solid storytelling. But I enjoyed it nonetheless.",1471996800,,3408,4.908145580589255
7701715,5,B01D64VSYI,"I cannot say enough about this movie. I have always been a fan of the Marvel films with the exception of Spiderman and I hated the Dark Knight franchise. I wasn't a fan of Henry Cavill's Superman before now either. However, I do like Ben Affleck and I was willing to watch this movie because I felt he could do a great job as Batman. I was not disappointed. I loved his portrayal, and by the end was even sold on Henry Cavill. Nevermind Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, she was just fantastic. We saw it in the theater, ordered it on Amazon to stream it and have watched it probably 5 times since. I will be buying the Blu-ray for my husband soon. I loved the brief look into the Justice League characters and the hints into the Wonder Woman film. Ben Affleck was absolutely amazing. He was the first actor that LOOKED like he should be Batman. He was in fantastic shape and not at all hard on the eyes. I loved that they didn't make him out to be a womanizer, and the fight scenes were very well done.

This does a wonderful job of converting a few storylines and also connecting the DCU for future movies.  I very much anticipate the rest in this series.  On this movie, I didn't get to see it in theaters, so the extended edition is all I know. I love it.  The slow parts people were complaining about give us a story that other nonstop action superhero films desperately lack.  Also, Ben Affleck did a pretty great job.  Definitely better than George Clooney haha.",1471910400,,650,4.512820512820513
7701739,4,B01D64VSYI,"Disclaimer: I'm a Marvel fan, a somewhat small DC fan.  And spoilers alert!

I wanted to hate this movie because a) Ben Affleck is in it, b) Jessie E. is in it, and c) it got poor reviews from a lot of people.

Ben did an OK job.  Wasn't terrible, wasn't great.  An improvement over George Clooney for sure, but not Christian Bale level.  Jessie, however, nearly ruined the movie on his own.  No where near what Lex Luther is suppose to be like.  If it want for the Facebook movie, I wouldn't have the slightest why he was casted in this role (Lex is a smart guy, ergo Jessie played Mark Z who is also a smart guy, hence the decision?).  If you don't know anything from DC lore, I guess you wouldn't care too much about this, but even so, it didn't make sense to have a weird, scrawny dude play the major villian role.  That's clich&eacute;, why can't the smart bad guy also be a physically intimidating guy too?

Next we got the gratuitous previews of upcoming DC movies literred in the movie.  Honestly, it adds next to nothing to THIS movie.  You can cut it all out and have the same exact movie.  Shameless plug by DC.

I don't want to spoil much, but the ending...ugh.  we've only had 2 movies (including this one) in the current DC movie universe.  It was way too soon to be killing off characters and what not.  AND resurrecting them!

The battke scenes were good.  Nothing spectacular, but it was enjoyable to watch heroes use the powers against each other.  You have to spend your belief in physics to enjoy it, otherwise you'll be cringing at what is unfolding on screen.  I get heroes are more than your average joe. But come on, Batman isn't superhuman.  He can't do some of those things shown in the movie no matter how much he works out or trains.

It's a shame Wonder Woman gets about 20 minutes of screen time.  Seriously?  She's dead center on the package! Would it have killed them to write her into the story earlier in the movie and play a bigger role?

The movie itself looks polished, it didn't seem like it was hastely put together.  In that regards, or looks like they tried to make this a pillar movie to build around.  I hope each subsequent spinoff gets the same treatment and not some low budget cash grab.  Some of the cameos looked really poorly done when compared to how Batman, WW, and Superman are presented.

I watched this movie for the first time at home with the extended edition, so I have no idea what was not included in the theactrical release.  It was a bit hard to follow during those annoying flashback/dream sequences.  I had to watch those parts over to get what was going on.

All and all, I don't hate this movie.  I'm glad I didn't waste $15 at the movie theater with a bunch of fan boys.  It's a fine movie.  It has its flaws.  But just try to enjoy it and you'll be able to ignore those flaws and see a movie about a two guys in costumes posturing for 2 hours until deciding throw down in the final 30 minutes.

It didn't start getting good until about halfway through.  And Wonder Woman got a pittance of a part, what a shame.  I don't know if she can pull off big box office numbers by herself ... she should have played a much bigger role in this movie, or whatever they have planned for her going forward.  They did a pretty good job at turning Bruce Wayne into a complete jerk, if you're into that.

Titans of justice Batman and Superman face off in the most anticipated showdown of our time, but while Gotham city's formidable vigilante takes on Metropolis' revered saviour the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs, and a new danger arises to threaten all of humanity.

DC are certainly back on top this year blowing marvel away as usual with the best comic book movie of the year, as if the dark knight trilogy wasn't awesome enough batman is back in a massive epic way and he's with superman, the story is handled really well and is a much more serious darker tone movie which really works so much better for creating that realistic gritty comic book edge, this is a really meaty action packed story that's got so much depth and awesome character development, especially for upcoming sequels and spin offs, the cast is perfect, Ben Affleck plays the screens most awesome batman to date looking like he's jumped straight off the pages of a graphic novel, the rest of the cast are top notch too like Henry Cavill who is a perfect superman, Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Laurence Fishburne are good in their roles, the most interesting new cast member has to be the delightful Gal Gadot as Wonder woman who is a fantastic character, Jesse Eisenberg also plays an interesting Lex Luthor villain role, the special effects are top notch all the way, brilliant soundtrack score, very powerful epic music that really drives the action especially towards the last 20mins, the ultimate edition adds great new footage that extends the story out more and is most part good stuff and don't slow any of the pace down, for 3 hours this is just epic and I cant wait for more! The movie looks amazing in HD too on Blu-ray. This is how a comic book movie should be, make sure you don't miss it.

In terms of direction, production, script writing, fight choreography and costume design ... all terrible.  Ben Aflac is either too old for the choreography (too slow and it looked staged and lifeless) or they hired the wrong person to design the choreography.  They should fire the script writers ... totally out of touch with the American public.  Batman's judgment reeked signs of immaturity. Batman is a drunk and has been for awhile.  Batman's costume looked plain and ordinary.  Batman had a second costume for the Superman fight, but there was no development I can recall of why he went with a fatter version of the costume.  Batman looked really fat in this second costume ... reminded me of The Hulk.  Yiiikes!  It seems like DC wants to degrade the image of super heros, maybe to make it look more like Dead Pool?  So, kill a superhero and then have Batman (who was probably drunk at the time) say he made a mistake in judging superman????  Have Alfred say there won't be any wine left in the cellar for the next Wayne ... if there is another Wayne.  Batman is such a loser, he cannot even procreate!  Even though it seems like superman may come back to life, DC screwed up the script so much, I don't think I want to see a sequel, unless they get new leadership.  Hollywood is really disconnected from main stream USA and Hollywood is doubling and tripling down.

There was more character development then what I had heard though I think some of the good story line was over shadowed by overuse of some over tried ideas, and emotional plays that we have seen too often.  The same could be said for the action scenes where some were quite believable while others felt forces and 'like you could could see the ropes being pulled' when the bad guys went flying.  Where they did well was in setting a believable story of conflict between the two characters at the start,  and in setting batman as the weaker character.  It would have been better to keep the conflict and story line to batman vs superman and to have left Doomsday out of the story altogether, and perhaps Lex Luther as well.  Overall, it had moments of feeling like a great super hero movie, such as Spiderman 2 or the last installment of  Batman where the acting is actually good, the story line interesting and the action seamless.

also contained the forced, poorly choreographed and overdone of say Spider man 3 and the 3rd Matrix.",1471824000,,1125,4.585

Marvel is more like for scenes tbh and for children thats why disney is incorparated with them when you see a marvel film you see nothing but children as when you see a DC COMIC movie you see LOTS of adults and some teenagers and some kids , so i think marvel fans shouldnt see DC COMICS movies cause its a darker genre and more mature than the silly marvel charachter that are no way can ever be realistic like what kind of hero is loved by a cops and consider vigilanties ?

This is not your typical young children's super hero movie, it's very dark and very unbalanced in the way of screen play and plot. Don't get me wrong, I myself can handle a movie with lots of dialogue in the first 1/3 of the film but don't expect your young one to be able to keep their eyes open without glazing over.
Most of the scenes are at night, most of the movie seemed like it fixed on Batman more than Superman. Ben Affleck did a good job but the movie was so rushed that I don't believe the audience could connect with him, or connect with Superman for that matter, Henry Cavil portrays Superman well, but he lacks substance of the character, much like the last Superman movie.
The worst and most embarrassing cast member is Lex Luther (Jesse Eisenberg). I don't remember Lex Luther coming off as a petulant child with too much money and a nervous tick, it's clear they were trying to appeal to the millennial here, as far as I'm concerned they did not do the character justice. They have lost all integrity, history and connection with any traditional remnants of the Luther character, they created a pathetic shell of a once great formidable enemy of Superman, now we have an extension of the entitlement generation with a bad haircut and a nervous twitch, it's pathetic.
Over all the movie was choppy, un-balanced, no connection with any character. Im afraid I have little good to say about this one, I want to like it, I wanted to love it. The CGI was good....if that means anything. It's clear Hollywood has sold out  many of these super heros to a quick buck, losing the integrity of the back bone that got us where we are today regarding our love of these hero's. Wonder Woman? Yeah that was cool, again, there was so much story to fill, that was left out, the Wonder Woman piece was useless. Lots of hype, very little substance.",1471824000,,2014,4.413978494623656

7701863,2,B01D64VSYI,"""How do you f@#k up an idea like Batman vs. Superman?""

That was the exasperated question many people asked after viewing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It seems like a complete no-brainer - take the two most popular, most iconic superheroes in modern culture, and put them in the same movie to duke it out. That concept alone would be enough to put butts in the movie theater seats. Yet it seems that Warner Bros. and director Zack Snyder are determined to show how to waste such an idea.

Acting as not only a sequel to Snyder's grim-dark Superman origin retelling Man of Steel, but as an expansion of Warner Bros.' own DC cinematic universe, BvS takes place about two years after the cataclysmic attack on Metropolis by General Zod and his destructive fight with Superman (Henry Cavill). The world is torn on how to respond to Superman, an alien being with godlike abilities whom many view as a savior, but just as many blame for the thousands who died in Metropolis and fear can singlehandedly take over the entire planet if he so chooses. Of those suspicious of Superman are a world-weary Bruce Wayne  (Ben Affleck), who feels that all his work as the nocturnal vigante Batman would mean nothing in a world of invincible alien-gods, and a jittery Lex Luthor Jr. (Jesse Eisenberg), a young billionaire with daddy issues he seems to apply to the father/God image of Superman. Both work to bring down Kal-El, but the world of superpowered ""metahumans"" is expanding and bigger threats are arising, so Batman and Superman must ultimately put aside their differences and join forces.

The film would have worked much better if it had a focus. It seems to want to focus on the conflict between Batman and Superman, with Lex pulling the strings, but the film also bounces around to subplots involving Lois Lane's fairly pointless investigation of Lex's involvement with a terrorist group (does the audience really need to follow such an investigation if it already knows Lex is behind it from the start?), Bruce's investigation in the growing population of metahumans, a bizarre prophetic ""Knightmare"" dream sequence that seems to only serve as a teaser to the arrival of a tyrannical villain's appearance in a future Justice League movie, introducing Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and setting the audience up for her own origin movie coming out next year, and shoehorns the monstrous Doomsday into the third act, a character whose story arc could've better served in a movie of its own.

You can see Warner Bros.' utter desperation to catch up to the Marvel Cinematic Universe on the screen. There's too much going on in this film. But rather than take its time to properly develop its story elements with multiple movies, they cram as much as they can into this film, so the film feels messy. Character motivations feel weak (Bruce Wayne, Lex) while some characters are completely wasted (Lois). Some story beats come off very clunky (""MARTHA!"") and some come off completely stupid (Lois and the damn Kryptonite spear). If the film spent more time developing the motivations as to why two heroes like Batman and Superman would actually wanna fight each other to the death instead of trying to set up future movies, then the audience would be more invested in their battle. And their battle feels slow, dull, and not very interesting at all, lasting maybe 5 minutes. It isn't even the highlight of the film, and that's sad for a film called BATMAN V SUPERMAN!!!

Jesss Eisenberg's approach to Lex Luthor feels all wrong for this movie. His portrayal is twitchy, jittery, and neurotic. It feels totally out of place in a film where everyone else is playing their roles fairly straight, and seems better suited for another Joel Schumacher Batman movie. Fans clamored for Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston to be cast as Lex and provide us with a Lex who is both smooth and sinister like a master manipulator. So Eisenberg's casting seemed like they were trying to go against-type and give us a Lex more like Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, but Eisenberg goes full-on Jim Carrey Riddler here, and it doesn't fit the film's tone.

Cavill's Superman is just...there. He doesn't even seem to have many lines in the film at all. He still isn't the Superman we want in a film. He should be standing strong behind his beliefs against the wave of doubt the world is casting up on him, yet he is still filled with doubt about his purpose in the world. This doubt and internal struggle lends a blandness to Superman that he shouldn't have. The world of BvS is a dark one, and Superman should be a beacon of light. But this Superman just isn't.

And Doomsday? Terrible. I could go on about the logistics of adapting a story like The Death of Superman to film, and I actually understand why he was used here. This is a world that doubts Superman's motives, so having him fight to the death to beat a seemingly unkillable beast of destruction is meant to get the world's people firmly behind him as a hero and stop questioning his purpose. But The Death of Superman was one of the biggest moments in comics in the last few decades that could actually take up the plot of one or two films, yet it is hurriedly shoved into the film's final act, and Superman's sacrifice doesn't feel earned because of it. Plus, Doomsday's character design is terrible, only passingly resembling his appearance in the comics and looking more like a bad Orc design from The Lord of the Rings.

There are a few highlights, though. Gal Gadot is great as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, a woman of mystery who is both strong and sexy, and she has great chemistry with Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne. It's just frustrating that the film would've felt more focused and been better as a whole piece if Wonder Woman wasn't involved. But she shines when she is on screen and has me looking forward to her solo movie next year.

Ben Affleck is great as a beleaguered Bruce Wayne. You can sense that his Batman is a man at the end of his rope, losing hope in the future after 20 years of battling Gotham's worst murderers and madmen. His chemistry to Jeremy Irons' Alfred is also great. But even this highlight has its problems. This Batman seems to have abandoned his moral code to not kill, straight up blowing fools up with his Batmobile and Batwing. It's not like we haven't seen Batman kill on screen before, as Tim Burton's Batman also gunned down and blew up the bad guys, and even Christopher Nolan's Batman took a few lives in the frantic climax of The Dark Knight Rises. But so much has been made about Batman's no-killing code in previous films and the seemingly casual approach to mass casualties in Man of Steel that BvS even spends much of its opening addressing this issue, it seems rather irresponsible to provide us with another superhero who is supposed to be against killing but seems to have no qualms offing henchmen. (And since Jared Leto's Joker exists in this world, it makes you wonder why Batman would kill hired henchmen like it's nothing but would let a true monster like The Joker live.)

So yes, this is a mess of a film that lacks focus and seems utterly confused with what it's trying to say or do because it feels more concerned with world-building, introducing new characters, and fitting in fan service moments than telling a coherent story. This is not how you want to set up your cinematic universe, and it leaves me cautiously wary of its future as long as Zack Snyder is involved and Warner Bros. continues to be obsessed with playing catch-up with its business rivals.",1471737600,9,7577,4.702336096458176

I could not, as an ethical being, let another minute go by without giving a clear warning before one more person wastes any of their hard earned money on this movie. I was aware of the hew & cry over the casting. I always try to give folks a chance. The last real uproar that I recall was Tom Cruise as the beautiful, sensual  Vampire Lestat. They even had the Author Anne Rice say she approved and boy was she wrong. Not just because of that horrible wigs and the incredible number of hours spent by techs  and Scientology trying to make Tommy boy into something he just isn't and will never be, the fans were completely right.  I guess I was in such denial  because I was so wanting a movie! ( The millisecond between Brad Pitt & Antonio Bandaras was worth every other disappointment)!!!. The fans were right to protest here as well and were right on point. The difference here is that the Batman studio and everyone else connected and interviewed, purposefully led me believe that the casting would not be a problem because the interpretation would be as Batman very tired, old, and just over the whole thing.  Part it was true except that it was much more encompassing.  It was Ben Affleck,  the cast and their assistants,the writer, the director, the tech, the costumer , the editors, the stunt people, gaffers # 1&2 , the people creating the trailer and me, who were all very tired, old and just plain tired of the whole thing. At least they got paid. They should have paid me, or at least given me a refund. Misleading ads...aren't there bait and switch laws in California? Although that wouldn't cover the pain & suffering. But it's not fair to say it was the casting choice the sort of sleepwalking monotone was the theme of the production. Everyone seemed depressed to have to have been a part of it. I'd be curious to see how many requests were made to have their names removed from the credits. There is no redeeming value to the movie and I apologize to those valiant souls, i'm sure there are some, who tried  hard  to make it into something worth everyone's time.

7701905,1,B01D64VSYI,"I hate to give movies bad reviews but I really disliked this one.
I'm going to start off with the whole ""I never read the comics"" spiel, so those of you that have, this review won't mean much to you.

My biggest issue with this movie was with the plot. The sequence of events weren't cohesive and left far too many questions that the movie never truly answered. It jumped around more than a toddler hocked up on sugar. One moment we're watching Batman's 'origin' and the next we're following Superman. There wasn't much cohesion, and hell, my wife and I got confused and thought Ben Affleck was going to be Superman instead of Batman. (Yes, we knew that Affleck was supposed to be Batman, but the way he was presented in the beginning was confusing). I understand that the cool thing to do in movies is to mess with the passage of time (which can jack up a plot if it's not done properly), but damn, I felt like I was reading Robert Coover's short story ""The Babysitter"".

Another issue, the stupid dream scenes. They were absolutely confusing. We had no idea what the heck was going on until the dream scene was close to ending. If you're going to use a dream scene, then make sure to serve it to us on a silver platter. Don't make me think that it may be really happening and then go  ""Hah! Jks, Batman was just dreaming y'all, gotcha!"" That's a big no-no in the writing world. It's called poor story telling.

Let's talk about the action. I love action movies, and I love watching copious amounts of violence, explosions, and destruction. This movie definitely had all of that. So why the heck did I still find this movie to be boring? It was almost painful to try and finish the movie. That's how boring it was. Action should be used to push the story forward. It's part of good story telling. The actions of the round characters are in response to an event, which leads to a point which the characters will never be the same again. Well, there was a little of that. I won't type up a spoiler, but there were definitely changes which the characters will never be the same again. However, it didn't seem like they were responding to the events so much as being pushed through them. It seemed as if they really didn't make any choices, and it was one extreme to the next. It definitely didn't help the plot issue.

There were some good moments in the movie, but it really needed a lot more work and a complete overhaul on the story part. I'm not sure if the writers/director were trying to do too much, or if they had bad footage, but the story really felt like it was lacking.

One last issue, though I would say it's more of an opinion based off what I imagine the character should be like. What in the heck was up with Lex Luthor? I can't speak for the comics, but in every other movie/cartoon, Lex seemed like a strong willed character. In this movie, he seemed more like the Joker. Completely unbalanced, unstable, and just goofy. I don't know if it was the actor, the way he was written, or the director's vision, but that character wasn't like anything I had scene of Lex Luthor before.

Anyway, I'm glad I rented the movie. I wasted five dollars instead of 20+.

I'm not going to say that you shouldn't watch it, or that you won't like it. I don't know you, so I don't know what you like. I'm just pointing out some issues that you can either accept, refute, or ignore. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy the movie more than I did.",1471651200,7,3438,4.3609375
7701906,5,B01D64VSYI,"I loved this movie.  I thought the way this movie portrayed the story and characters as they would be perceived in the modern world with our current media and politics was excellent.  The older more jaded and complex Batman was portrayed extremely well.  The batmobile was the best yet.  Even though the previous version was very good as military bridge building vehicle the new one is a high speed urban warfare tank with the armor and weapons it would need to fight modern criminals with military weapons.  Superman was also very well done.  Then Wonder Woman just perfect in every way.  I think I have a little different perspective on these comic book movies than many people because I started reading comic books when I was four years old way back in the sixties.  I read them until my teens and I have a deep love for these characters.  I really like the way they have been portraying a more realistic Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman over the last decade and I cant wait to see the movies coming up next year.",1471651200,2,1017,4.543956043956044

7701912,2,B01D64VSYI,"I was disappointed with this film. I prefer more action-adventure in my superhero stories and this was more of a drama-fest. The casting of the actor who played Lex Luthor was off for me. He seemed more like a clownish bipolar than brilliant genius. Ben Affleck as Batman was not horrible, but he was not given much to work with and came off as stiff, dry, and boring. The ending with Wonder Woman was the best part, although her parts throughout the movie seemed like filler. They would just show her looking mysteriously at something and then flash to another scene. I feel the writing and overall plot could have been better. The whole conflict with Batman and Superman was based on a misunderstanding. I just don't like the decision DC has made to try and make ""grittier"" films. I like the action-adventure, as stated. This felt overly long and needed a dose of humor.

I'll add that I really liked the first one and this was an auto-buy for me. I expected to like this. I went in wanting to like it.

7701941,1,B01D64VSYI,"Congratulations Affleck and Snyder, you've officially earned the title of making THE Worst Batman Movie Ever Produced. George Clooney and Joel Shumacher (of Batman and Robin [1997] fame) are out of the hot seat. Believe the bad reviews, this movie is that bad.
SPOILERS AHEAD.
Where to start, dream sequences don't belong in this kind of movie. Period. It destroys the possibility of realism. I know it's a superhero movie but there are MANY superhero movies out there where I left the theater thinking, ""That seems like it could happen one day."" Not here. And there was no reason for backstory with Batman, all that did is show that the people involved with this film don't know their audience.
Now, I loved Man of Steel, it's my favorite Superman movie to date. But Snyder simply took his formula for Man of Steel and inserted Batman: go back and watch Man of Steel and you'll see what I mean.
I don't care for Ben Affleck, he can't act and couldn't cut it as a director (which is the only reason why you go back into acting) but I went into this with an open (and hopeful) attitude of ""Maybe Ben can pull off the Bat."" Nope. The actor forgot that Batman doesn't mindlessly kill people, and Batman doesn't use guns. Batman relies in his superior mind and martial arts training to win. Snyder's and Affleck's version of Batman is nothing more than the Punisher in a Bat-suit.
How is that Batman literally shoots across the ceiling when we first see him, but can barely move in the fight scenes? That rediculous first dream sequence was one of the worst fight scenes I've watched. You can see the actor pulling punches and he moved like an old man. I can let it slide when he was wearing the armor suit but not the other fight scenes- it's unacceptable for a Batman movie.
The studio wants market share from their competitors, I get that. But they're trying (and failing) to reinvent the wheel by making their characters so cold and unappealing. Snyder tries to tug at your heart strings in the beginning with a child that Bruce Wayne saves. But my wife and I both wondered what a kid was doing all alone in the city, in the middle of the day, in the middle of the street, in the first place. I had zero sympathy for the characters, not even the senator in the court scene.
This film was atrociously miscast. Jeremy Irons could not pull off Alfred. Ben Affleck's drawl ruined any credibility as Bruce Wayne and that stupid voice synthesizer was just a rip-off of Bane from the amazing Nolan Batman film. Henry Cavill was believable as Clark Kent, but was all over the place as Superman (I can do this, no I can't, Lois please help me I don't know who I am!). Lois Lane was ok. Perry was ok. Wonder Woman was an afterthought (Let's through her in the movie because she's part of the Justice League). But the absolute worst was Lex Luthor. Jesse Eisenberg's addaral-snorting OCD personality-type would have been FAR better suited to the Riddler.
I understand DC is behind Marvel when it comes to films produced. But that's no excuse to cram the entire Justice League back story into one movie! Cyborg got about 11 seconds of screen time as did Aquaman and the flash. They would've been better off giving each character it's own movie then have them all meet in this one. That way we care about them and Justice League has more meaning when everyone comes together. I haven't seen Suicide Squad but I'm now extremely concerned with it because Joker is my favorite villain of all time, and it looks like that actor is playing Black Mask and Two-Face instead of the Joker.
This movie had tremendous potential, but it was trying to be everything at once which resulted in nothing more than a mish mash of hollow and confusing characters. I heard Affleck altered the script and it shows with such gems as, ""What falls... is fallen."" Really? That's the best you can do? Batman has been my favorite character since childhood and Affleck ruined this film. Here's to hoping Affleck hangs up the cape (and the pen) and calls it quits.",1471651200,3,4022,4.564315352697095

Why I felt it was bad was  the writing was awful. I have seen just about all these character  movies and this was far worse. The Batman was really really bad. I felt like the actor was so preoccupied inflating his chest to look more built, then he was at making the audience believe in his character. It always seemed like he was holding his breath and trying to talk his lines. Superman seemed like the same from his past films but Batman needed alot of work. I felt they threw in Wonder Woman to try and save the film once someone read the script saw that the writing was very poor then added her in to try and save it.
I would never hire the screen writers ever again. Nor would I have allowed the Batman character to be acted so poorly by the acer that was chosen. Should I'd picked an unknown actor to play Batman.",1471651200,,969,4.148936170212766

I am a fan of Batman and have read graphic novels and watched animated versions of this very script. Even the Lego movie has batman locking up a batch of Kryptonite, worried that Superman will go rogue. So this tale fits in the DC universe for me. My one bone of contention is what is extended about the extended version. Fans are arguing about 3D theatrical/4K extended and Blu extended/theatrical. But I watched the Theatrical version and the 3D back to back one night and I could not find anything significantly different from one to the other. Where is it supposed to be extended?

It could be that the director was going for edgy, cartoon frame style jumps - and if so, that is indeed the impact.  Save your time.

7702019,3,B01D64VSYI,"Going to Review on the Theatrical cut and write for anyone who not watched the Theatrical cut to NOT buy that one

Animated source which follows this idea was:Dark Knight Returns
In Dark Knight returns the Heroes were all forced into Retirment since goverment thought they were to dangerous. So everyone either flew home planet, retired and got a normal job, or went into hiding. Some people like Superman started working for the goverment. After Joker returns being let loose since they thought he had reformed, and the Sons of Batman a group that was formed in the spirit of the missing batman the other robins return trying to stop the hassle, and Batman returns as batman to attempt and stop the Joker. This upsets the political officiols who send Superman/Clark to arrest an old out of shape batman. This was also sometime after Jasons murdering by Joker and Batman started thinking ""Maybe, Jason as misguided as he was, was right, there is no reason to leave Joker Alive"". Jason had always been very agressive and willing to kill villians when Batman was Not. At this piont Batman decides he will set out and murder the Joker, Once and FOR ALL""! At the same time he realized hes slow nad out of shape and people fighting batman have taken note of how slow he is. So batman makes a medal suit, in order to give him some strength since he can barely stand up, and to be able to move around more since he really having problems moving at all. So this creates another fight with Superman and they fighting and Superman says ""Turn yourself in"" and Batman say how Superman is sold out the the Goverment.

Established Role:Batman has always been seen as a vigilante and disliked by a lot of higher ups. However has always had the cops and Jim Gordon on his team. In the Gotham Tv Series it shows the Cops are very corrupt, and Gordon watched over Bruce as a child trying to solve the Murder of Bruces family. Jim believes in doing whats right and seems he has a respect for Batmans want to do the right thing for the greater good. So generally batman has the police covering for him even though everyone else doesnt agree with batman, and often angry at Gordon. Batman has always been more of a Antihero.

Established Role: Role Superman has always been the golden boy. helping in naturual disasters, saving kittens from trees and the occasional rescue of Loius Lane. He is a country boy who is as an adult working as a reporter in a gaint city. He has always been viewed as a symbol of hope, and was always the perfect Goody Goody. That is why in the movie ""Dark Knight Returns"" It makes sense that they would start working for the goverment.

The Live Action Material: Batman and Superman have no reason to fight. The reason they end up fighting is Lex Luther(Which people have complained is not like the tv show Lex) is pulling the strings and munipulating these two characters. Instead of these characters fighting becuase of different ethical stand pionts which is exactly why they fight in the show, and why they often bumping heads in the comicbooks, and in Justice League.

Roles:Batman is shown as the Golden Boy in the Movie, and somehow they painted Superman as the Antihero role I guess. As well as throwing in a bunch of God vs Devil undertones, and stuff about Racism. Which if you want to make a movie about that, Fine do it! but leave Superman and Batman out of it or at least don't make that the heaviest Influence.

I mean, don't get me wrong, there are things to like about this movie. Snyder knows how to make a gorgeous looking shot, but by in large it's like he ran the entire film through an especially depressing Instagram filter. Affleck's Batman is good, and so is Gadot as Wonder Woman, but even they can't save this mess of plot and awful character motivations. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is absolutely atrocious. You get the feeling that they really wanted the Joker to be the villain in this, but they couldn't have him, so they just wrote Lex Luthor to be the Joker, only more obnoxious.

7702034,3,B01D64VSYI,"A little disappointed with the lack of action until the last third of the movie, Ben Affleck is only so so as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonderwoman is a hit.",1471564800,,152,4.1
7702035,4,B01D64VSYI,"I'm not a film critic (though most of those people are so far out of touch with typical movie-goer reality that their opinions are useless anyway) so I'll keep this as short and try not to belabor my thoughts on this film. Instead of giving an overall review, I thought I'd save some time and just tackle the most controversial facets of the film.

1. Ben Affleck can ruin a movie, and in fact, he has ruined a superhero movie once before (Daredevil): He did not ruin this movie. In fact, I would suggest that he is the best Batman portrayed in film so far (though it's hard to really judge this based on one feature film). He is a lot like Frank Miller's Batman (a broken down, grizzled brawler) than anyone else so far (I thought Bale was okay, but he straddled the line between the coy superhero like the Keaton/Kilmer/Clooney Batman portayals and the anti-hero that is embodied by the Dark Knight).

2. The theatrical version left so much good stuff out but also managed to keep the boring stuff in: this is true, do not bother with the theater version, get the Ultimate Edition and be done with it. You can go back and watch the theater cut like I did to see why some many people disliked this movie originally, but watch the Ultimate if you want the best movie experience.

3. The film has a tedious and somewhat boring beginning: this is true, especially for those of us who know who these heroes are and what they're about. My wife, who is brand new to comic book movies and only knew Batman from the Bale films and Superman from the Man of Steel, she found the first hour interesting, though she did admit to starting to feel like the film was moving too slow just before the pace picked up and the movie started to feel like a superhero film again.

That's really it. Superman and Batman were well done and our first real look at Wonder Woman was pretty awesome. All in all, this was a good movie. No it's not as good as titles like The Avengers but the source material makes it hard to be anything than what it is and what it set out to do, it really does well in the Ultimate version.",1471564800,2,2096,4.325699745547074
7702036,4,B01D64VSYI,"Ok so lots of people took turns crapping on this movie so lets do a quick pro/con rundown shall we:

Cons:
Pacing, like holy Swiss cheese Batman, Snyder has to learn to tailor down his movies to two hours or so because at three hour mark, one has to wonder if he wouldnt of been better off making a two parter
Superman VS Jesus, so in the quick scene were superman is kneeling down and a crowd of people are reaching out to him -  yeah, I couldve done without that.  (talk about sucking the camp right out of this)
Doomsday looks like a roided out cave troll from LOTR
Re-visiting batman origins understandably to give us the vision he wanted to but maybe not make it so lengthy seeing as its been done a few times already.
The fight itself, sorry, Batman fans but maybe Superman went into the fight to talk Batman out of it, but as soon as he got hit from the first dose of Kryptonite and recovered he would of ended it right there and with his Moms life on the line, broken Batmans arms and legs and bam overI mean the guy has superspeed AND super ridiculous strength so.
Taking that further, Superman must know that Batman would have to be stupid  to go into the fight without  an ace up his sleeve and would of therefore probably have some form of kryptonite on him and Sups wouldve taken out Bats right at the beginning. But it had to end the way it did to serve the story, which is the one thing Directors need to stop doing, suspending disbelief for their convoluted storylines.

Pros:
Batman, Superman, Wonderwoman and the short intros to Cyborg and friends all look frigging awesome and the action is always amazing and never Kiddied down  this is why I love Snyder movies, he pays attention to the visuals and the combat looks about as real as it going to get in superhero movies.
Hell, Batman, who I barely like, came out as awesome badass in and out of the suit so Kudos on that
(best Batman to date)
Sups looks like he should and all that without padding, Jason Mamoa looked amazeballs in his short scenevisually there is not much to bitch about.
Lack of humour, not a huge problem for me
So all that to say that the visuals are a treat no matter who the camera is on at the time, and all the rest that people bitch about, well, what movie is perfect nowadays??Huh?!?!
Had this come ten years ago it wouldve blown us away but thanks to Marvel, spoiled we are.
And as an afterthought, DC, are you listening?
Target your movies to an older more mature audience therefore you will not compete with Marvel on the PG13 level HEAD ON, (and yes there is more money there but in the long run it would really help to cater to a slightly different demographics)
Then you own the AA 14 and R rated scene which would make up for the PG13 crowd.
Not a perfect movie but not deserving of the amount of bandwagon bashers ire it has received thus far.",1471564800,4,2848,4.302238805970149

7702065,1,B01D64VSYI,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst superhero films I've ever seen. Wait, make that films in general. It was so boring. Like torture yourself boring. I was literally in awe of how slow the pacing was, how bland/confusing the story was and how terribly edited the fighting scenes were.

Plainly put, it was just bad. The whole premise for Batman and Superman fighting was even horribly written and executed. Lex Luthor writes a crayon letter to Batman and takes a polaroid of Superman's mom. Okay, now fight! It was seriously the most idiotic thing I've ever seen.

Jesse Eisenberg's apparent ""Lex Luthor"" was irritating and moronic. I couldn't believe that this iteration made it past the preliminary concepts. He is supposed to be a cold, calculated, evil genius manipulator that is the true Lex Luthor. He misses the mark completely.

Wonder Woman was unimpressive. She didn't have the presence that Wonder Woman should possess. Plus she just didn't look the part. The only thing that informed me that she was Wonder Woman was that she suddenly had on a Wonder Woman-esque outfit near the end.

In fact, I honestly thought she was supposed to be Talia Al Ghl throughout most of the film.

Batman and Superman were just, ugh, I can't even get into everything wrong with them.

Overall it was just an incredibly boring, depressing, terrible movie. I avoided the trailers and all marketing attempts to spoil the film so that I entered the film with an unbiased viewpoint. The way films are meant to be seen. So you're surprised and shocked when you're supposed to be when they make a big reveal or twist. Then it doesn't ruin the punchlines and amusing parts either. Instead I was fighting the urge to fall asleep or to just walk out of the theater when I first saw it. This film was devoid of amusement or entertainment of any variety.

They claimed an R-rating was the problem with the poor reception. Hence why they released this with added footage to bring it back to that R-rating. I guarantee it doesn't salvage this abomination of the beloved Justice League characters. Here's to hoping for a reboot without the dreadful Zack Snyder at the helm.  Maybe then I'd see a real superhero movie.",1471478400,,2196,4.745406824146982

7702067,1,B01D64VSYI,"Hands down one of the most awful films ever constructed - not just in the super hero category but in terms of all cinema in general this one is just atrocious. Disjointed, confusing, and chock full of inane philosophy-101 ramblings of good/evil that more or less assumes that the audience is completely stupid, we get boring heroes and a Lex Luthor who looks like 90's era musician Beck rambling about power, theodicy, messianic imagery, etc, while the viewer is being left repeatedly asking ""What the heck is going on in this film?""  Ben Affleck's Batman is like everything else Ben Affleck does: it's basically just watching Ben Affleck play Ben Affleck (albeit a grumpy Ben Affleck this time) and while Henry Cavill has the look and build of Superman, his acting has the consistency of cardboard. Even further muddling this mess was the introduction of Wonder Woman (and her contrived hint at the other eventual members of the Justice League - this sort of thing worked much better in the Marvel films, but just seemed artificial and rushed here. And we learned basically nothing about Wonder Woman's background [heck, we barely got Batman's origin this time... they crammed it into the opening credit sequence!])  The CGI is atrocious (particularly the first batmobile sequence, but the fight sequences really blow any convincing credibility) and the music, like everything Hans Zimmer writes, terrible and unforgivable (Superman's theme consists of that one strange note that sounds like it was ripped off from Peter Gabriel's 'Games Without Frontiers' [oh yeah, great material for the Man of Steel there, Hans], and the Batman theme sounds like Zimmer just grabbed some material from Jerry Goldsmith's music from 'First Blood' (except without any thematic complexity). Can't Hollywood produce any decent soundtracks anymore?
Sigh. This tangled mess was so awful I was actually anxious for it to just end.
No surprise this film was a flop: it's cold, it's dark, the colors are dingy, the acting is terrible, the effects phony, the writing contrived and philosophically juvenile, the music childish, and there's nothing to in any way make me want to watch this terrible turkey ever again.",1471478400,2,2192,5.103064066852368

7702106,4,B01D64VSYI,"There is a good movie in here, somewhere. What was really needed was not including extra footage, but a smart, ruthless editor with no attachment to the idea of a franchise. Many sequences were tediously long. I got the idea how and why Bruce Wayne hated Superman in less that two minutes, but the movie went on and on hammering it in. Lois Lane should have been a side character and Alfred Pennyworth's many side comments became numbing. I could have done completely without Lex Luthor. This movie is about Superman and Batman, deal with that and not silly Congressional hearings that just reinforces what Batman believes.

What really saved the movie was the last 45 minutes or so. The fights between Batman and Superman were well done. As they progressed, I began appreciating Ben Affleck take on Batman more and more. Henry Cavill has nailed THIS Superman iteration perfectly. Wonder Woman was a nice addition, but she was also slightly annoying, but also somewhat intriguing. This jury is still out about Gal Gadot.

I am glad that I purchased this movie and I actually look forward to watching the theatrical version. I also can't wait to see the Justice League movie but hope they lighten it up.

7702111,3,B01D64VSYI,"The movie overall is ok, but the ""Ultimate Edition"" was supposed to add footage that made the flow of it better, and solve the mysteries that the theatrical version didn't explain. Nope. Same movie with a few more scenes and new characters who also aren't explained. The fight scenes are cool, but I kept wondering why the Snyder Batman is so thoroughly cold, heartless, and murderous in what he does. Clark Kent (Superman) has a legitimate reason for investigating him, and a real reason to be suspicious of his style of justice. However, that's the only thing that Clark is remotely sure of. He's completely unsure of himself, his role in the world, his mission, etc. He questions everything he is and does, yet continues to go save people. The two headline characters had more question marks on why they are so remotely different than the source material that it leaves much to be desired.

What worked in the film is the main villain Lex Luthor. Finally we have a truly psycho billionaire with a discernible reason for hating Superman. That hadn't happened on screen in film before. Doomsday looks like a creator that was rejected from the Lord Of The Rings set who mated with Abomination from The Incredible Hulk. Surely someone at WB saw that too before they hit ""publish"" on the creation. Or not. It's just silly.
And what brings the two completely opposite heroes together isn't the woman who can kick both of their asses at the same time (WW), but two women who have the same name. Sheesh. I don't think there's a version of the film that would make that any less silly unless they took it out.

I'm hoping Justice League is decent. I'm hoping Aquaman is too. I have more faith in Wonder Woman. But I have little faith in Warner Bros to create stories that make cohesive sense, and that matter to the audience that has been following these characters sense childhood. It seems more like decision-making by committee, which has never worked for this company. If you're going to try to keep up with Marvel, maybe learn from their playbook of building cohesive and collaborative story-arcs that follow a big BIG vision. Instead of trying to do everything all at once.",1471392000,,2173,4.700787401574803

Performances aside, this movie is very Batman-y, in a tone and look that I don't think really works to DC or Warners favor. Desaturated Superman is incredibly bland, and while Batman's motivations make sense he doesn't do anything in the familiar vein of the movies surrounding this one. The war of the cranky orphans escalates in a way that puts Batman's contemplative mind on the shelf and basically glorifies their incredibly well toned bodies.

7702150,2,B01D64VSYI,"I think this would have been more acceptable in an animated format because essentially, that is how it came across on the big screen (not meant to be a compliment).

The first mistake, hands down, was casting Ben Affleck as Batman.  No.  This was not a good decision.  Ben Affleck is better behind the screen in writing and directing ... acting is not his forte.  Other than Burt Ward during the 60's, the best Batman has been Christian Bale.  After that, Michael Keaton (yes, he made a great Batman oddly enough).  Everyone else in the role has been mediocre at best.

The second mistake was the dialog/script.  My 6 year old has come up with better dialog playing with her dolls than what I saw coming out of this movie.

Throughout the movie, I mostly shook my head and laughed... and I saw the long uncut version which was a waste of my time.  The musical score was excellent... hence two stars instead of one.

I know the movie made a lot of money (lol), but it certainly did not make a lot of money because it was good.  The audience who gave this movie good reviews has to be made up of pre-teen to Gen-X boys/men... other than that, who would?

  Llex Luthor and Wonder Woman are great! Lex is a perfect genius, and is played very well; and this is the first wonder woman I actually like! (I know she is supposed to be a big Amazon woman, but it just never worked for me). This actress has more of a toned-down character build; Maybe it's just personal preferance, but I like the change.
  After watching about half of it I connected the dots and realized that this comes directly after ""man of steel"". Also the 3D version has scenes where it looks alright, and then parts where it is terribly pixelated and choppy  maybe the movie wasn't made for 3D and they just altered it? Or maybe I received a bad copy? Who knows. It deffinily isn't worth the extra for 3D though. For casting great actors and being sponsored by Jeep, you would think the movie would have better quality picture. There aren't any scenes that make it worth it.

One with an IQ above room temperature would wonder where the hell did Batman get an Iron Man suit.  Also one would wonder if Wonder Woman Dianna Prince been hiding out in Washington D.C. for over a hundred years why the hell no one ever noticed that she did not age.

And of course anyone who can THINK would wonder what the hell was wrong with Bruce Wayne that allowed him to be FLIPPED by fake newspaper articles sent to him by a mentally diminished Lex Luthor.  I wonder if those responsible for this D.S. movie knows why Lex Luthor has a hatred for Superman.  CLUE: It started with Superboy.

And then there is the freaking monster that looks a lot like other cartoon monsters that have been in so many poorly presented movies.  The glowing eyes, the Ben Grimms facial features and the XXXX shirt size.

This movie is very poorly written, poorly staged, and poorly presented. and it varies so much from the original concept of Superman Batman and Wonder Woman that the producers should be sued for plagiarism for using the names of well established Super Heroes to get people to look at this crap.

Those who are saying that they love this movie must be either paid by the studios, given free copies of the movie, or totally without any prior knowledge of these Justice League characters.

Chose to watch, but suspend any knowledge of Superman, Batman or Wonder Woman because this a misrepresentation, so greatly lower your expectations.",1471305600,3,2070,4.645604395604396

7702179,5,B01D64VSYI,"I wasn't that excited about this movie. I never considered seeing it in the theatre, and after reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure I'd bother watching it on Netflix. Then a friend recommended the Ultimate Edition, and lent me his copy, saying that the mediocre theatrical version had been excessively abbreviated, and this version redeemed Zack Snyder's vision and execution. I was really skeptical, but my interest was piqued.

I can't say how this compares to the movie that critics tore up when it debuted in theaters, but I've gotta say, THIS movie was great. I liked the grim tone and dark look. I liked Henry Cavill's Superman and Amy Adam's Lois Lane. Ben Affleck absolutely killed it as Batman. And contrary to almost every critic and a good number of fanboys, I really dug Jesse Eisenberg's vision of Lex Zuckerberg, a convincing reinterpretation of Superman's arch-nemesis; a billionaire millennial who puts his genius to the task of toppling a demi-god, setting up and knocking down a complicated arrangement of dominoes, the last of which is meant to crush the Man of Steel.

The events leading up to the climactic face-off were just as entertaining as the scrap itself. While Gal Godot's Wonder Woman felt a bit like she'd been shoehorned in, she was also a charismatic wild card with some memorable moments. She also helped to connect events to the larger DC Universe, including the much-anticipated Justice League, which Snyder will also helm, and her own forthcoming film, which has built up some buzz with a stellar trailer.

The story cherry-picks elements from Frank Miller's 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' -- the whole Batman versus Superman scrap is fairly close to the comic, minus Lex Luthor as instigator and general sh! t-disturber -- and the infamous 'Death of Superman' storyline from the late-eighties -- a monstrous Kryptonian abomination dubbed 'Doomsday'. The film doesn't concern itself with an orthodox retelling of these classics, obviously, but they're integrated fairly well.

It no doubt rubbed a lot of critics and audience members wrong to see Superman dragged into the grimy chaos that Batman has comfortably inhabited since the first Nolan film, and Batman himself has gotten darker: dropping f-bombs and breaking arms and legs, branding the bad guys, even picking up dropped guns and killing them when necessary. Very unlike Bruce Wayne, who lost his parents to a gun; Snyder gives us yet another replay of that famous murder, which was a bit redundant by now... but whatever. This wasn't as good as the Christopher Nolan trilogy, but it was better than a few of the critically praised Marvel films... deeper, more emotionally engaging, where some of the Marvel films that critics and audiences favored have been slick, technically proficient exercises that left me cold.",1471305600,2,2823,5.064516129032258

Ben Affleck actually does a nice job with Batman and Gal Gadot makes a fantastic Wonder Woman (unfortunately she's only in the film for under 10 minutes), but Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor (aka Jim Carrey's The Riddler) is so far of course he's not worth mentioning (but I guess I did). And while I really enjoyed Henry Cavil's Superman in Man of Steel, I was annoyed by his, ""woe is me"" character here.

Visually Zack Snyder's films have always been attractive, but storytelling wise they definitely need help. I was also very underwhelmed by the big Batmobile chase scene and the CGI of the legendary vehicle itself was lacking. In addition, that ridiculous armored costume may have worked in the graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, but looked plain goofy here.

I am a Batman FANATIC. So it only made sense that my husband would come home one day with this movie. We settled in, I put on my Batman pajamas, and pressed play. Now, we sit together, playing on our computers because the movie is THAT BAD.
First of all, casting MATTERS. Sadly, the director didn't get that memo. Ben Affleck as Batman is a giant disappointment. He doesn't have the acting skills to pull it off. There are very few moments in the movie where you actually believe that he's Batman rather than a grown man playing dress-up. The choice for Lex Luthor will remind you of Dr. Reed in Criminal Minds. He's sinister, smart, but rather that outright fearing him, he makes you feel unsettled. Alfred is a character that is pivotal to all of the Batman movies. He acts as Batman's conscience, and the line that keeps him grounded in reality. His age is also important because he helped to raise Bruce after his parents were killed. He's old, sage, wise etc. In this movie, the only similarities between who Alfred is SUPPOSED to be and who they cast, is that they named the man ""Alfred"" and he has an English accent. Otherwise, he's completely unbelievable in the part. He's about the same age as Batman, and does very little in the way of advising.
This movie COULD have been amazing, but it's almost as if the director had never seen a Batman movie, nor had he ever read any f the comics. The ONLY positive is Superman. He plays the part well, looks the part etc.
The story line is all over the place, the casting is awful, and the acting is mediocre. Trust me on this one...don't waste your time or money.",1471132800,,1767,4.44

7702315,5,B01D64VSYI,"Warning: My Review / Feedback Contains Partial Spoilers (very minimal)

Background of me/my experiences to identify w/ other prospective viewers:
- I am a fan of film in general w/ well executed script & production
- I did watch theatrical version during released weekend in theaters
- I am a snob when it comes to sound & picture (IMAX minimum for me, luckily I am fortunate enough to have a local chain that offers digital picture & ATMOS sound)
- When intially watching this film - I came into with very low expectations due to poor reviews thus allowing me to initially enjoy my first watch of it, yet also not enough to give it flying colors as the story is very jarring w/ the amount of material & new characters they are introducing viewers to

Personal feedback on Ultimate Version upon second watch:
- Much smoother and more well rounded story
- For first time viewers, you will still have lots of WTF moments as the new characters & concepts WB/DC are trying to introduce draw heavily on the comic source material
- While I personally never followed the comics, I was only able to piece together a bit of background info from my own quick dabble of research
- Things to be familar with when initially watching:
  1) Main roster of Justice League team
  2) Meaning / Backround of ""Mother Boxes"" and who future threat to Justice League is
  3) Knowing that Affleck's version of Batman is a more brutal, jaded, older, cynical, and darker as its a different perspective on the character (think along the lines of Wolverine)
- All that said, the Ultimate version is highly recommended for 17+ viewers as I can see how much of a difference those extra scences did the the story and characters
- All the new elements WB/DC are trying to introduce are much better executed due to the extra back story included
- Scenes cut from this version included all that made it an R rating to notch down as a PG-13 for theaters
- To that note, the R version isn't more gory per say, just included much more violence (i.e. killing); this did lots for Affleck's version of Batman (partial spoiler alert: this version kills bad guys)
- We also got to see who Jena Malone played, though very brief as it at least allows fans to start making theories of the DC universe (as she was fully deleted in theater version)
- I also recommend recently watching Man of Steel if you can, movie picks up during the climax of the first after initial scence of Batman/Bruce Wayne (at the very least re-watch the final act leading into the climax to give you a better viewing experience)

Hopefully my comments will help potential buyers/viewers.

P.s.  Something to note too for other audiophiles   The U.E. is 7.1 ATMOS encoded for those that have implimented that setup for home. I personally haven't upgraded yet so can't give feedback on that home experience.  It was a welcomed find for me though as will be the first movie I pop in to test when I do.  On non ATMOS setups, it still came out TrueHD loss-less encoded, so sound was still top notch.",1471132800,4,3025,4.5451197053407

7702318,5,B01D64VSYI,"Unfortunately, the theatrical version of this movie was butchered thanks to the studio, but at lease we get to see the movie as it was intended in this Ultimate Edition. Even if you've seen in theaters, I highly recommend re-watching the Blu-ray release to fully appreciate this movie.

As it is mentioned in the description, it has an additional 30 minutes of footage that actually helps you understand the character's motivation, background, and state of mind through out this film. Just to give you an idea without spoiling anything, there are scenes that clearly outline why people were up in arms against someone, the motivation behind Batman's plan and mistrust, an entire sub-plot of Clark investigating the Batman, Lois investigating Lex (and an entire character that helps with that investigation that was cut out), and much more.

In the theatrical release, I felt that some scenes were inserted in places that slowed down the movie. Turns out, that was also done by the studio, so what you're getting here is the scenes in their correct order, which helps a lot.

The characters here are not two dimensional. Lex, whom Jesse Eisenberg portrait uniquely and flawlessly, was not born evil, he's misguided and has his misplaced ideology and motivation. Batman is walking that grey line between light and dark. He's been jaded by Gotham and you can see that in his actions and his words. You're seeing a Batman who's been fighting crime for a decade, and in the process, losing loved ones and his trust in everyone but himself.

Now, a couple of problems I had with the movie were:
1. Lois Lane's character. I don't think she served any purpose, especially towards the end of the movie. She also had a couple of cheesy dialogue with Superman.
2. (Warning: mild spoilers) They tried to introduce at a bunch of plots and characters that will make more sense as the other DC movies come out (Wonder Woman, Justice League, Darkseid, etc), which left me hanging. Maybe they should have hinted at their existence (talking about the Justice League members here) instead of showing a 2 min clip.

In closing, I'd just like to say that Ben Affleck was amazing as Batman and Bruce Wayne. Major SPOILERS ahead: those bring up the 'Martha' scene between Batman and Superman and think ""he stopped because their mother's share the same name"" clearly were not paying attention. Again, this brings up my other point were the characters here are not two dimensional.

7702330,1,B01D64VSYI,"The writing was terrible, directing terrible, acting terrible.  DC needs to stop trying to make everything so dark and edgy.",1471132800,,124,5.2
7702331,5,B01D64VSYI,"I had mixed feelings about the theatrical cut of batman v Superman. I liked it but I was severely dissatisfied with the end result. The ultimate cut on the other hand is excellent. This should have been what was originally released. Every actor gives a stellar performance. Even the supporting cast is good. Ben Afleck is the best batman. And this is my favorite superhero movie. I give this one a 10 out of 10 and 5 stars. This is how I rate batman. As far as the performance goes it is Afleck, Bale, Keaton, Clooney, Kilmer. As far as the movies go it is batman v Superman ultimate cut, batman, the dark Knight, batman begins, batman returns, the dark Knight rises, batman forever, batman and Robin. This is a masterpiece of modern cinema. I know that most people won't agree but when it comes to comic book movies this is the best. Zach Snyder is now my favorite director and batman v Superman on my top 5 favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended.",1471046400,3,957,4.474285714285714
7702332,5,B01D64VSYI,Better than I expected. Awesome special effects and good story line. I was really impressed with the directors camera work. Unusual shots and use. I loved the character portrayed so convincingly by Anthony Hopkins.,1471046400,4,214,5.323529411764706
7702333,3,B01D64VSYI,"Being a superhero movie fan, I decided to watch the extended version of this movie instead of the theatrical version.  Although I don't hate this movie as some have, I do think this movie is a bit short of being a flawlessly made one.  The theater version is already long at over 2 hours and 30 minute with this extended version adding 30 minutes making this over 3 hours long.  I didn't mind the movie length as I found it to be pretty evenly paced and I thought the story entertaining enough to keep me interested even though I have some criticisms of the movie.

Although I think Affleck does an ok job as Batman, I cant help but miss Bales performance as the Dark Knight.  Affleck to his credit does play the bitter, broken Batman pretty well though.  Cavill is ok as Superman as is Gadot as Wonderwoman.  I personally wasn't a fan of the nearly incoherent performance of Eisenburg as Lex Luther.

Although I get what the movie was trying to do by portraying a bleaker version of Gotham and Metropolis after the Superman/Zod battle with our heroes facing their own inner doubts and demons, one of my faults with the movie is how easily Batman became a gun toting killer, with a handgun, machine guns in both the bat-mobile and bat plane.  I had no issue with Batman becoming a bit bitter and becoming a bit darker but he is a character that always resorted to his tools and not guns.  To me, it was a bit too much out of character.

Although I think some movie series try to stretch out the profit margin by making one too many sequels, I think this movie suffers from the opposite problem.  To me, there are too many things stuffed into this movie that really should have been made into at least two, maybe even three movies.  You have the whole Batman/Superman issue, Wonder Woman making an appearance, along with Aqua-man and Flash Justice League storylines, in addition to the Lex Luther, Doomsday and Suicide Squad storylines.  It is almost like DC decided to throw in multiple plot lines as an advertisement for all of their franchise in the hopes that they will have success in their upcoming future movies.

The special effects are good and the action is also what helps make the movie watchable and entertaining, but even with all of that going on, I really feel like something is missing in the movie that would make it better.  I am not sure what it is exactly, but I just think that this movie misses the mark a bit someplace. The movie ends up a bit muddled at times and it just doesnt seem to be as cohesive of a movie that it needs to be.  Is it as bad as some say, no, but it does fall a bit short of being a great one.

The action doesn't really get started until about an hour in. Until then all we get is talk, talk, talk. Weird talk when it came to that Eisenberg guy. He was a terrible villain, and I don't mean 'terrible' in a good way. His voice sounded like he was whining all the time and no one takes a whining villain seriously. Henry Cavill frowned and grimaced his way through this movie, but at least he never messed his hair up. Did you notice that?

Batman's fighting style was really cool - used a lot of grappling hook to take down enemies.  Great contrast of man's ingenuity versus superhuman strength of superman and wonderwoman.  Wonderwoman was way too skinny, not like classic portrayal in comic books.

Everything was flat... the acting, the gray scenery, the plodding story, and even the action. They were just going through motions without much emotion or motivation behind their actions.

Also the movie felt very small. The big, world changing political events were told through just one character besides the heroes, so it didn't really feel like these events were impactful to the world at large.

Also, they just mass murdered people in multiple scenes, and practically forgot about it moments later. The most contemplative anyone got was when Lois said ""it keeps me up at night"". Thanks for telling us, because wouldn't have known otherwise.

Finally, the editing was pretty bad. First they make you watch people do mundane tasks to make sure that you know exactly how they got from point A to point B, and the next minute they're jumping across the globe, through time, and through space without any foreshadowing or follow up.

I'm sure people will still complain about how dark the tone of this film was, but honestly, I find that one of the most refreshing things about it.

It was just so long and while it was cool to watch The Detective solve the case(after being lead on a merry chase) the film really needed some comic relief. Plenty of great visuals, but without a little humor it lacks depth and humanity. That's only a minor quibble, though. I enjoyed the film and it's held up to multiple viewings.",1470873600,,452,4.6625
7702422,5,B01D64VSYI,"This is THE BEST superhero movie I have ever seen! It was more than just kick ass action (although there was plenty of that!)

Much has been said about the psychological and philosophical aspects of this movie and I believe it belongs in the ""inner circle"" along with Marvel's best. I hope Zack Snyder does not listen to the drug addled crackpot critics and water down the elements that have made this movie a cinematic masterpiece.

In addition to all of the superlatives I must say I believe this movie has the best Batman (same caliber as the Dark Knight trilogy), the best Superman, the best Lois Lane, the best Alfred, the best Jonathan and Martha Kent, and far and away THE DEFINING Wonder Woman!!

I have movies that I have bought and gotten rid of and movies that are in the carrousel next to my Television. This movie and ""Man of Steel"" are in that group along with ""Lord of the Rings"" Marvel's finest, Fritz Lang's and Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces and three others. Question: What would your three be?--and do you remember where that question is from? (Hint: that movie, while a classic, isn't one of the three.)

Again; kudos to Zack Snyder for a true masterpiece!!",1470873600,,1177,4.644230769230769

First well they wasted way to much time showing Batmans back story. Unless you've been living under a rock, how do you not know his back story? That or they assume you've never seen anything about Batman, movie or otherwise before this one. But they show nothing of Superman's back story, they just assume you've seen Man of Steel, which I had not. So I was a little lost when they show the attack on the city so suddenly. Went back & watched Man of Steel and it made way more sense. The movie after that just feels to disconnected, lots of long fights, really really long fights. And it just moves so slow. Could have been about half the running time & been better. But did like the intro to the other DC characters like Wonder Woman.",1470873600,,887,4.192982456140351

7702434,5,B01D64VSYI,"I was real excited when I found out they were making this movie back in 2013.  Then when it finally came out in March, I went and saw it twice and loved it.  There were problems with the story, I'll admit that.  But it was still very well made.  I learned that there was going to be an extended cut of the film released on Blu-Ray and was interested in how that might change the overall movie.  It did this by making the film flow a lot better than it had before.  A lot of people had complained that the movie is too dark.  Guess what?  It's supposed to be.  Sure Superman generally isn't considered a dark character, but Batman is.  His role is as big as Superman's, so there is a constant sense of darkness to the film. (Also it should be noted that the graphic novels are dark, but no one ever seems to complain about them.)  There also might be some confusion in the middle of the film.  Going back to the story, there is a huge easter egg in the film.  I won't go into details, but will say that Zack Snyder put it there to start conversations of what it could mean.  And finally, there have been people saying that DC should do what Marvel has done/is doing.  NO THEY SHOULD NOT!!!  They are two different companies, they have different characters, and they portray them differently.  I have NO problem with Marvel.  Been a fan of their movies for years.  But as I said earlier, they are different.

So when people ask me if they should see this movie, I say yes. I always say ""Don't listen to anyone, not even professional critics.  If the movie seems interesting enough to you, watch it.""  And if they only see some or all of it and don't like it fine.  At least they were informed when they made that decision.",1470873600,6,1720,4.256965944272446

Ugh, did the disc just skip ahead, how did Batman get into the desert wearing all that gear?  What are those winged flying things that beat him down?  Oh wait that was just a really long dream sequence?  I'm so confused.

Thank God that Morpheus was cast in this movie; he's the only one who can act.  Can we just have a movie about him running a newspaper?  Maybe give him some clip-on sunglasses.  At least Lois is hot now and Wonder Woman is totally awesome.  Maybe she can get her own movie that just tells a clear story from her perspective - that would be a novel idea.

The last few Batman movies were spectacular.  This isn't.

7702529,3,B01D64VSYI,"I'm not a DC fanboy and I had no preconceived notions about how this movie should be. I was not one of the people that flipped out about Ben Affleck being cast as Bruce Wayne, and I did in fact really like his performance. But, this is defintely more of a Batman movie then a Superman movie.

This movie was no worse then any other Zack Snyder movie. If you don't like his stuff, you certainly won't like this. Like Civil War though, the evil plan that was at work here relied on so many ridiculous variables for it to come together it was kind of silly. If Batman and Superman just talked for, literally 5 minutes, they would have figured out that some bad guy (for what reason?) planned this and they could have took him out.

The title was also silly, for many reasons, one of them being ""v"" instead of ""vs"". Somewhat related to that point, is that conflict between Batman and Superman being implied in the title and only seeing them kind of fight for 3 minutes. If I were in charge, I would have named it ""Dawn of Justice: Batman meets Superman"".

While Wonder Woman certainly didn't make the movie worse, her appearance did seem forced. On the contrary though, the inclusion of the other Justice League members was laughable. Lois Lane and her desert plot line were pretty awful and distracting.

Jessie Eisenberg wasn't as bad as I thought he would be, but this take on Lex Luther was a lot different and I honestly would have preferred a bit of a more mature Lex with perhaps a real motivation for doing what he did.

I'm pretty bummed that Doomsday and General Zod were in the trailer. The movie would have been a little bit better of those two points were surprises.

In summary, as a non DC fanboy, this movie was pretty much what I expected. There were a lot of laughable plot points (considering this movie was supposed to be a more realistic and gritty comic book movie) and there  was a lot of room for improvement but I feel it more or less is what it was supposed to be.",1470787200,,1986,4.365853658536586

The film was merely a bridge between the prior movie -- which I didn't set -- and the next one about starting the JLA. Ridiculous battles. Batman clearly insane, so to my thinking, not what I want in a Batman/vigilante.

Best part of story was the hundred-year old meta humans. I read The Death of Superman years ago, so I'm curious on whether they're planning to resolve the non death similarly.

Gal Gadot was a great choice for WW: tall, lean, athletic, with exotic accent.

The true genius of Zack Snyder's vision was able to be seen with the trajectory of Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne in both their journeys individually and together. (not to give any of it away) With this extended length it was much more clear the intent and internal struggles of the characters and journeys.

A beautiful tie to the comics drawing from so many stories, I believe the extended version was able to truly tell the story that he had wished.

The film does have the extra length, however the story captures you and your attention, with only light predictability as can be expected from a Block Buster film.

Ben Affleck as Batman was as bad as everyone said it was going to be and Jesse Eisenberg is even worse as Lex Luthor. He portrays Luthor more like the Joker.

7702670,1,B01D64VSYI,"If DC had hopes of catching up to Marvel in the feature film arena, This film did NOTHING to help that cause along.  As if Zak Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" wasn't bad enough, this film happened.

The plot is subpar and incohesive.  To say that this film has the smooth flow of a volcanic eruption would be generous.  There are scenes that make zero sense in the scope of the film.  It was like the people writing this film too a bunch of random bits from some comics and regurgitated them onto a script.

The casting choices did NOT fair any better.  Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor clearly has no grasp on the dicotomy of the character.  Lex Luthor goes from being a charismatic Don Juan that hides a dark and sinister side to being a wannabe Jim Carrey with a side of pseudo-emo.

Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?  Are you kidding me?  Who did she sleep with?  EVERY acting role she's ever had has been panned.  Seeing her performance as the most iconic Amazon ever is sure to be panned as well.  She struggles with every line she delivers.  The only thing she does with any sort of grasp on being a thespian is when she grunts during fight scenes.  Good luck with that stand alone film set for summer 2017.

Ben Affleck is the ONE high point in this film.  Though there are scenes where his performance seems a little strained. He brings a new dimension to the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne that we've never seen before.  Overall, Affleck soars in the role of the Dark Knight.  His performance is the MOST nuanced in the entire film.  He brings layers and depth to the character that are unmatched.

Jeremy Irons is fantastic Alfred Pennyworth.  The legendary Mr. Irons gives another high caliber performance as the comic world's favorite butler/man-panion.  Mr. Irons holds the bar high with his performance.  He is one of the most talented actors in the history of film.  His work is all about nuance and depth.  This is no exception.  Jeremy Irons in this role takes Alfred to a new level we haven't seen before.  This performance will come to be known as one of the most definitive.

As a lifelong fan of DC Comics and Batman/Superman, I had hoped for better with this film.  The first time I watched it, I hated it.  The second time I watched it, I loathed it.  Then I bought it on digital, I still feel let down by this film.  Overall, it seems like a desperate attempt to try to compete with Marvel too fast too soon with no development. I think perhaps the folks at Warner Bros. and DC should have given a little more time and consideration into the race for box office success.",1470787200,5,2573,4.427350427350428

I hate myself that I saw this movie twice in theaters because I thought I missed some big reveal at the end about the Flash and (sarcastically) Aquaman only to find out it was some BS on the flash drive full of stolen information from the WORST Lex Luthor ever put on screen!  You could have made Kevin Spacey deliver all of his lines in semaphore in Superman Returns and it would have been lightyears ahead of what Eisenberg brought to the role.  And HOW does Batman go from I will kill you because you can destroy all of us on a whim to your my bestest buddy in all the world and I will live everyday to make people love you  all because their mothers had the same name?!  (and as we all know Martha Kent was not his mother it was his ""foster"" mother)  I had high hopes for this movie but Batfleck disappointed and the script was atrocious.

I only give it two stars versus one because they at least put some money into this joke of a movie. The nail in the coffin was casting that stupid, goofy Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Talk about a casting failure of mass proportion. He seemed more like a Joker or Ridler wannabe than a Lex Luthor.

As for the epic failure of Henry Cavill in the role of Superman, please fire this loser already. He has the looks and the build but he absolutely sucks at pulling off the character in any meaningful way. He acts as bad as Keena Reaves (or however you spell that non-actor's name). Superman is not a ""super model"" but that is all they are playing the role to. His mere presence should fill the room. As big as Henry Cavill is he just reminds me of that character in ""White Collar"". My imagination can't stretch far enough to make any part of this epic fail film captivating. Just two people, beating each other up. The first Rocky movie was better than this garbage. Poor plot. Horrible casting.

If all you care about is special effects, you may like this flop. If characters, acting, plot,and writing also matters to you in these type of movies, you are in for a disappointment.",1470700800,,1287,4.4033613445378155

7702719,1,B01D64VSYI,"The plot of this film is contrived. ""Let's figure out how to make Batman and Superman fight."" There's no real plot. The story jumps from place to place. Maybe if they had made it two separate movies (one about Batman and one about Superman,) then there would be room for some character development and cohesive storytelling. My rental ran out before I could get to the ending. I never even saw Wonder Woman, so I assume she just appears out of nowhere near the end. I don't want to waste another $5 to try to figure out how it ends. I only rented it because I heard Suicide Squad will make more sense if you see the end of this. Now I'm not even sure I want to see Suicide Squad if these universes are connected in any way.",1470700800,4,723,4.2086330935251794

Same goes for the Lois Lane subplot involving the bullet. I also appreciate the new ""Clark Kent as a reporter"" scenes. I like that shmexy nerd. Won't spoil the movie if you haven't watched it, but this is the version to see.

The one downside to this Blu-ray set is that the DVD copy only has the theatrical cut, though the digital copy has both. Lastly, there's a bonus disc with a bunch of special features and they're super neat.

I'd give the theatrical cut a 3.5/5, while this Ultimate Edition gets 4/5 stars.",1470700800,,666,4.588235294117647

7702732,3,B01D64VSYI,I was surprised by this movie. It was very dark by nature and not talking about the lighting. There was a lot of time spent developing a story line in which unraveled at the end of it. I did like the connection to previous Superman movie. Yet there were many scenes where the writers just took it the wrong direction. The director seemed to cave to the writers trying to keep to the story line. Which was a moving target. What action scene included in the movie were very good. DC Comics really needs to step up its production.,1470700800,,527,4.333333333333333
7702733,3,B01D64VSYI,The action sequences and special effects were good. Justification for character actions? Not as much.,1470700800,,101,5.8
7702734,3,B01D64VSYI,"This is a film which fell victim to what seemed like an organized smear campaign.  A hostile army of reviewers potrayed it as nothing but a steaming pile of manure, awful in every way from the script to its technical aspects.
  In actuality,  this is a film with amazing technical qualities -  from special effects as overwhelming as any I've ever seen to cinematography as gorgeous as you'll see in a Ridley Scott film.
  It does have structural problems, though.  You could say that it is a movie made up of beautifully crafted scenes that just don't hang together very well.
  Maybe this is because Zack Snyder shot a 4 hour movie but Warner Bros only released 2.5 hours of it.  Even this new 3 hour version feels like scenes are missing.  But many of these beautifully crafted scenes drag disastrously, especially in the early going.  Maybe not such a good idea to add more of them. It's a movie with pacing issues.
  But I think the real problem is that Batman and Superman do not, well, make sense together.  In the same universe. Let alone in the same movie.  Each character is highly self contained and each is best operating alone, in a world with no other heros in it. Batman never needed Robin and should never have had him.  It's The Joker Batman needs.  And on any planet where Superman resides, absolutely no other heros are needed. Superman is so super that he has every superhero base covered.  Of course, Batman Isn't super at all. He's just a very well resourced and clever vigilante.  Superman could easily crush him.
  So the film makers who decide to make a film called Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice have some serious problems to solve.  There probably are solutions to those problems, but I don't think these film makers have found them.
  And this despite the fact that this movie has the best Batman ever conceived for a film, and has also the only version of Superman who makes any sense at all - and make no mistake:  Henry Cavill IS the definitive Superman thus far (as much as I enjoyed Christopher Reeves' take) and Ben Affleck finally brings to the screen a Batman who is pretty much an unhinged fascist, just as the character should be played. No silly rules against killing for this Batman. This guy is serious about his work.
  So I give this movie 3 stars. It has a muddled script with issues of internal logic and pacing problems.  But it also has magnificent technical aspects and the two central characters, though they don't seem to belong in the same movie, are better drawn than ever before and at least as well acted.  Ironies, contradictions and wonders never cease.
  So watch the movie.  Prepare to be bored at times and frustrated as well,  but also to be amazed at the sheer spectacle of the stronger parts and to be floored by the powerful performances of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill.
  And the unresolved contradictions of having these two in the same movie?  They're pretty fascinating if you ask me.",1470700800,,2955,4.590038314176245

Batman kills often and without remorse and the uplifting feeling one is supposed to get from a Superman movie is shockingly absent.

7702861,4,B01D64VSYI,"I liked this movie probably more than most mostly because im biased when it comes to DC and Marvel superhero stuff. Of course there are plenty of things they could have changed or added or even could have done without, as there are with all of the previous movies. I like how they introduced a few of the other members of the Justice League that will not only be in the sequal but will also have their own Movie in the not too distant future. Some people seem to have issues with Ben Aflek being Bruce Wayne/Batman but i dont. I think i like him better as Matt Murdock/Daredevil though.  I also like Jesse Eisenberg better as a social networking, zombie killing, magician-protagonist than a villainous Lex Luther-antagonist. He is a good actor all around but i like him better as a good guy. Actually his role in Now U See Me is probably borderline of both. Back on topic....One thing that tells me if a movie of this genre rates high on my scale is that after i have watched it, being one second after or days after, i have a desire to watch it again, then to me it rates above a 7 on a 7-10 scale.

Ben Affleck does a fine job as batman, as does gal gadot and Henry cavill. but for a movie in which everything is so over the top--from the music, which reeks of and contaminates every scene with pompous self-importance, to the constant displays of various parts of the nude male body (we get it, you want to give the ladies something to look forward to), it ends up being rather lackluster.  a confused plot, in which confused characters spend two hours talking--mostly about things you either don't understand,  or just don't care about, with one final, equally irrelevant action sequence at the end.

7702892,1,B01D64VSYI,To start off this was a garbage film. A burning dumpster fire full of manure is slightly more entertaining to witness than BvS. The conflict between Batman and Superman which was supposed to be the focus of the film was lost to shoehorned JLA intro's and a two hour snoreathon of poorly written dialog. The reasoning behind their conflict was full of contradictions and the resolution to that conflict (*spoiler alert*) was there mother's have the same name??? I desperately wanted this movie to be good and stomached the entire stinkfest. But after carving several hours of my life out that I'll never recover there was a wave of nausea that came over me and ping of fear that this team is responsible for DC's future. RIP DC.

7702899,4,B01D64VSYI,"To give a full review would require too many spoilers. Overall it is a great movie, well worth the watch. DC was a bit stuck because they couldn't go back and do ANOTHER Batman movie to lead into this movie, so the only lead in is the previous Superman movie. So, you have to assume quite a bit about Batman, which works for the most part since in fact there have been SO MANY Batman movies. But it makes a few small parts of this movie a tad redundant on the Batman side, and some stuff leaves you wanting for a lot more info to fill in. That said, the extended edition is MUCH better than the theatrical in this regard. Overall, worth the price even for non-comic fans. Not the best comic book movie you'll have seen, but very far from the worst too. Better than 2008 Incredible Hulk, but nowhere near the Avengers movies.",1470700800,,824,4.288461538461538

7702905,3,B01D64VSYI,"Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, and Gal Gadot performed great. Affleck performed great as Batman and of course, the lovely Henry Cavill does Superman great justice. The criticism I would give would be the story line. It jumped around a bit and was at times hard to follow. I think that the feud between Batman and Superman could have been written a bit more convincing than it was. I also wish that Batman's anger and current dark place he was in, in the film would have been elaborated a bit more so that viewers could understand what is really going on in his mind and why he was in the dark place he was. I also am disappointed with the final fight scene between Batman and Superman; the common ground between the two was a bit silly, but again, maybe it is the way they connected in the comic book. Finally, I feel that the final epic battle between all the super heroes and villain fell a bit short. It was a bit cliche but perhaps I viewed it that way b/c I am not familiar with the comic books.overall I did enjoy the movie, it could have been better but I would recommend it.

7702950,5,B01D64VSYI,"Zack Snyder is a visual story teller. But this movie in particular has deeper context in the dialogues exchanged by all characters. The theatrical cut was good, but felt it could've been all put together much better for a more wider audience appreciation. To those of who are new to Zack's film making, his movies do lot more justice in the extended cut releases on dvd / blu ray. The Ultimate Cut of BVS is simply fantastic. The scenes flow so much more better. Character motivations are explained lot more clearly. Luthor hates god, and with Supes existence and the world worshipping him as God, he takes it upon himself to destroy Superman. Not just physically, but mentally piece by piece. And he puts his elaborate plan in motion right from the desert Superman incident. There's no other comic book themed movies intro scene that has looked as stunning in its execution as BVS. Right from the frame per frame TDKReturns comic intro of Bruce seeing his parents gunned down with the pearls falling down, leading all the way to the battle of metropolis seen through Batfflecks eyes, just sublime to watch. Goosebumps.

My only criticism for the film are the few scenes where Batman/Bruce Wayne stuck their tongue out to show their frustration. One such scene is when Alfred talks about everything's changed, good men turn cruel , the camera cuts back to Bruce and you see him sticking his tongue out. And the other scene is after Bruce realizes he's been living his later years of his crime fighting life with rage and that he was almost about to become a Joe chill to Superman. He takes a step back, the camera shows Batman and there he is, a quick second of Batman sticking his tongue out. These felt odd, wish the director could've pointed that out to Ben while filming.",1470700800,2,1775,4.670926517571885

What I would like to see (10 years from now) is the events of the Frank Miller graphic novel played out on the big screen. 10 years have passed, Batman and Affleck both are actually older, Angry to see the world turning to garage and he returns one final time. Fighting his way thought layers and layers Gothams underworld until he gets the attention of Superman and they finally finish what they started.

You can tell he's highly influenced by individual frames from comics and his constant slow panning in on these stationary scenes where characters sit still staring at nothing reflects that.

The big difference between this movie and say captain america winter soldier or Christopher Nolan's Batman is that BvS is Snyder's attempt at a comic book with motion while those other comic book movies are just movies that just so happen to have comic book characters in them.

They could have edited out so many slow panning space staring shots out of the movie or cut them much shorter and had a far better movie for it.  Halfway through I could not help but roll my eyes every time one of these scenes popped up.",1470700800,,962,4.608187134502924

Christian Bale is 42 and Ben is 43, so I'm not sure why they would pick someone older to play the roll. Let me tell you Ben is definitely showing his age! I know Christian cant play the role forever, but why pick someone that looks like an older Batman?  As far as the movie goes I didn't get that glued to the screen or anger at the bad guys feeling. I didn't really get the plot to the movie. Batman and Superman hated each other why? Oh because each of them fought crime and had casualties? Sounds a little hypocritical for them to blame one another. They both had blood on their hands. The best actors were Super Woman and Lex Luthor. Awesome performance by Lex Luthor!

7703133,1,B01D64VSYI,"As a longtime reader of comics I've learned to approach the movie adaptations with caution. They are not movies made for comic fans, as that demographic is far too small, but instead made with a mass market appeal in mind. That being said, some of the mass appeal movies produced have been genuinely fun and entertaining. Upon hearing the early negative reviews of this movie, I thought maybe zack Snyder succeeded in producing a comic book movie actually made for comic book fans.
This is not the case.
This movie is not fun, nor is it entertaining. It is not made for comic fans, despite relying heavily on panel like visual moments and having that fascist style of batman frank Miller popularized.
It's like they took the panel to panel illustrations and removed all the color and words.
There was so little emotion to the acting I would readily believe that was intentional.
I won't even get into the plot, but it was a mess.

7703147,1,B01D64VSYI,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. I had high hopes going into this but was severely disappointed. It was 2 hours of basically being beaten and screamed at, so much violence added with the extremely loud ""music/sxf"" was very off-putting. The one glimmer of hope was Wonder Woman but she was on screen for less than 10 minutes total I believe. This film's ""plot"" was non existent and the reason for the fight between the two superheros was the most ridiculous part of the film. Don't watch this it will just ruin all the characters involved for you. I was such a fan of these characters for decades and Zach Snyder and company have yet again ruined another film, why is he allowed to continue ruining DC???",1470528000,,722,4.519083969465649

7703149,3,B01D64VSYI,"Superman and Wonderwoman were great.  Batman and Lex Luthor were awful.

Batman uses guns, one scene wears a trenchcoat over his batsuit (WHY?) and Lex is more eccentric like the typical Joker or Riddler portrayal rather than a focused and calm Lex Luthor as I'm familiar with from several story arcs.

I look forward to the Wonderwoman film, and hope Henry Cavill is cast in more Superman films over the next decade, he's excellent at the role.

Besides Batman's killing tendency and use of assault rifles, the thing that bothered me was that they condensed so many different story arcs into one movie.  If you're not familiar with those stories, it leaves a lot of ""what the hell just happened"" moments, will confuse people and make little or no sense.  Even being familiar with the stories, it was disappointing like a tease reminder of a story without any real elaboration.

7703152,3,B01D64VSYI,"Expecting the worst and not having seen the theatrical version, I found this movie to be better than expected, but not really above average.

Low points:
1.  Musical score.  Not sure what they were going for here, but I found the music generally detracted from many scenes and turned what could have been an interesting moment into a want to forget it moment.
2.  Peter Jackson called - he'd like the Troll you stole from Moria and used as Doomsday back.
3.  Lex Luthor impersonating the Joker.

Middling points:
1.  Skinny underwear models still don't really look like Wonder Woman and she didn't have enough film time to get any sense of character acting, but Gal Gadot wasn't horrible in the part.  Though she doesn't (to me) look the part, I actually like the actress so I'll be rooting for her in her solo film.
2.  Everyone raving about WW's theme song makes no sense to me other than the fact that it was OK amongst a whole lot of bad making it stand out.
3.  There are some plot holes (including a whole lot of lack of character development for people like Lex) but on average, it wasn't tough to follow though I hear much of the extra footage in this version helps that.
4.  The fight scene between Batman and Superman was ok, but felt very contrived.  Let's face it, Batman without Kryptonite loses, Batman with Kryptonite wins.  Now, how do we stretch that into some screen time........

High points:
1.  Batman was well played, as was Alfred and IMO Superman.  No, they weren't textbook and there was an awful lot of death for characters that don't usually do such, but IMO, it wasn't a terrible movie adaptation.  Certainly not as bad as I was lead to believe.
2.  I'm usually not a fan of Snyder's work, but in many places, the film shots stood out (and in many places should have stood on their own without the cheesy musical score.)
3.  I'm actually looking forward to the follow up films, hoping that they learn from the audience and critical reaction to deliver a better film.  Failing that, hopefully the studio gets out of the way and lets them make a full movie.",1470528000,,2083,4.504

That said, the ""idea"" of this film is far better than it's execution.  Great actors are left standing there and it's hard to tell if it's part of the plot or just the actor's realizing this may have been a mistake.
For me, things just didn't fit together.  Concepts were left to dangle.  Ideas were just forgotten or ignored.  Keep in mind I'm being vague as not to spoil anything.  Suffice to say I base this on NOT what I wanted the movie to be, but simple as it was.  It takes a tremendous effort on the part of so many people to make just one movie happen.  So I'll simply leave it from a comic book fan and an even bigger fan of cinema.....I feel if DC continues down their storytelling methods for future films, then there will be no future films.

I have asked everyone I know who has seen it, and they are either wrong about what they thought they saw/heard, or they are not educated about the intertwining comic book story arcs that make up the movie so they are just confused. I've seen this movie 4 times so far and it always hits all the right notes with me. I am a long time fan of the comics and I understand every aspect of this movie and where the themes came from. It's just that the themes are mixed up into a new waywhich is what comic book stories always do to change things up and make them fresh. This is Dark Knight Returns mixed with Doomsday (Death of Superman) and Justice League Darkseid Wars. Please read the comic books/graphic novels and this movie will make more sense.

It is three hours long and none of that time felt wasted to me. The story is a good one and it is told well. I do wish Wonder Woman could have had a larger role and longer cameos would've been appreciated, but I was entertained throughout.

i definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes watching superhero movies.",1470528000,3,570,4.367924528301887

7703164,5,B01D64VSYI,"This movie has so many deep dualities that it is not unlike a secret identity.  It is a sequel, yet it stands on it's own. It is made for fans, yet it is made as an action film for people who are not familiar with these characters. It has so many deep references to comics and films that have come before it, that many are probably lost on people, even those that claim to be longstanding fans. That might be it's biggest flaw, in that I don't think everyone will get it.
It did it's job for me. It entertained me. I got a thrill seeing Wonder Woman kick some ass. I felt joy seeing Superman fly and Batman pulverize thugs. I knew a lot of what was coming yet I still was unable to predict the outcome. It wasn't boring to me, it was rich and verbose and chock full of shiny goodness. There were a few weird moments but that can be said for any movie.

Side Rant: DC and Marvel are two comic companies with two very different core philosophies. Marvel is about creating characters that have everyday problems but also have amazing abilities. DC has always about showing us characters that have amazing abilities who also have everyday problems. What's the difference? Well, for example, Spider-man starts off as a normal kid with acne, is bullied, can't get a girlfriend and sucks at sports who gets amazing powers but still has all those problems PLUS all the problems of having amazing powers. Superman started as an all american he-man with good looks and all the powers. A weakness (kryptonite) had to be created for him, because he was too perfect. Different flavors, like Coke and Pepsi. If everything was the same no one would care about either.",1470528000,,1652,4.485049833887043

7703166,1,B01D64VSYI,"Words can't even describe how worthless this movie is.  DC doesn't understand their own characters.  Batman apparently orders bullets in bulk (when a gun was what motivated his war on crime in the first place), Superman doesn't even put out a fire when saving a woman from a burning building (the only unselfish heroic thing he does in the entire movie), and Wonder Woman apparently has a sword made of Kryptonite (she lops off Doomsday's arm like a knife through butter, but can't stab him)?  This movie is awful, and ""fans"" of these characters who claim to like it have lost all credibility.  The first 70 minutes are a cringe-worthy slog towards an illogical confrontation between heroes.  The climactic battle is all video-game cut-scenes.  Cinema!  You'll have a richer, more interesting, more exciting, and more worthwhile experience playing Injustice.  By the way, the only reason people think Wonder Woman is the best part of this movie is because she's in it for about 5 minutes and barely speaks.  And, as mentioned, they still managed to mangle her character (Did you know she's got super-speed?  Because why not!).

By the way, I'm choosing to focus on comic-book criticism, but as a film divorced of context this would barely qualify as a coherent, much less artistic, movie anyway.

A couple plot holes that made me laugh (the only enjoyable part of watching this):
- Lois is NEVER told about the Kryptonite...she just somehow knows that this weapon will kill Doomsday (who she has no reason to think is Kryptonian anyway).  Maybe she read the script!
- The world turns on Superman because a bunch of terrorists are gunned down?  First of all, that's stupid would make no sense to anybody; secondly, said terrorists mention that they're already targeted by drones, so why would the government care that they're dead anyway?
- Superman's first EVER face-to-face meeting with Lex Luthor is motivated only by having saved Lois...until then Superman had no idea Luthor was even a villain.  Great way to introduce one of fiction's most classic archenemy dynamics!",1470528000,4,2072,4.965217391304348

7703168,3,B01D64VSYI,"I have a lot of problems with the theatrical release of this film, and though the extended cut does redeem itself in some aspects, some of the inherent issues can't be fixed just by adding another 30 minutes. Lex Luthor's motivations were always pretty clear, it was his plan that I had trouble understanding in the original. Now they flesh out things that make Lex's plans make slightly more sense, but its still way more convoluted than it needs to be, and the structure is more cohesive, meaning the order of scenes makes it resemble a movie rather than a disjointed series of events. That's basically all, though. Lex Luthor's plans make slightly more sense, so he doesn't seem like as much of an idiot. Yay...

If you had a problem with the ultra violent Batman, the lack of Superman being Superman, how short the fight between the two of them was, Wonder Woman being shoehorned in, the way the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg were established, and anything Lois Lane did, then you'll still have to deal with all of that. If you thought the reason they stopped fighting was dumb, it still is. If you thought the pacing was slow, well....I mean, it's 30 minutes longer now. To their credit, it makes slightly more sense and is slightly less of a headache to watch, but there really isn't that much more of a good movie here, and it still doesn't warrant another viewing.",1470441600,,1369,4.610655737704918

Not to mention the story makes no sense, and this is an obvious ploy to introduce a justice league movie.

7703171,5,B01D64VSYI,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's a movie people. Put it on to be entertained and escape for awhile. All these people taking it way too serious is annoying to me. Yes, I've collected and read the comic books. Yes, a lot of things are different but I know to go into these movies with an open mind. I also believe they change these stories to fit the times, so people of this day and age can relate (even though it's a make believe story with make believe characters).

I watched the Man of Steel and BVS with my 13 niece and 12 year old nephew, and witness them experience the same excitement and emotions that my brother and I did when we watched Christopher Reeves as Superman and Michael Keaton as Batman. And I, myself enjoyed this movie A LOT. That's really all you can ask for in a movie....to take you places...to take you on a journey. Some like where it goes and some don't.

And I'm not a Ben Affleck fan but I totally accepted him as Batman. Christian Bale was better but Ben was great in his own right. Henry to me is perfection as Superman. I hope they do more with Henry as Superman and Ben as Batman. And I'm really looking forward to Wonder Woman and Aqua Man movies.

I heard and read the negative reviews before seeing this movie but I knew to yawn and ignore them. I saw the movie anyway, and loved it. As soon as this movie was released for sale, I bought it. I'm a Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime member, so I have access to plenty of movies. I only buy movies I love.....Still just see the movie for yourself. Don't let the bias critics and the whining comic book lovers stop you from taking a chance on this movie. Make your own opinion.

The theatrical version was crap and was cut up so bad that it was confusing and choppy. the Ultimate version was so much better, not perfect but better at least we had explanations for what was going on. Lex Luthor, brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg. is plotting bad things against both Batman And Superman for many years and he stokes Batman's hatred of Superman (the Alien, to him) to make him go after him. Everything that can be said has been said so I will say this...Ben Affleck as Batman is the best, Christian Bale lost this title because of the ""Voice"" I could never understand him. Henry Cavill is terrific as Superman, what a Bod! I loved Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman....finally got it right. Doomsday looked like an angry green pseudo hulk, and not as Good.

Not only boring and pointless but feels like too many stories cramped into a single movie to try to tie universes together... failing miserably at all attempts. Batman is nothing short of a cold blooded murderer. For the character actually making a point of not killing his enemies (albeit being brutal with them), this Batman too gleefully and shamelessly murders all his opponents. Makes you wonder why he didn't just murder everyone at Arkham and closed the series for good. Superman has no personality, and his puppy eyes get old very quickly. Wonder woman... I don't know why they say she's the best character... that's more of an insult to the rest of the cast than anything. Cardboard Woman should be her name. No backstory, you never care about her and she only participates at the end of the film. Don't get me started about Lex Luthor. I think he's the worst character I have ever had the pain to endure. He is completely unlikable, dresses, acts, talks and behaves like a deranged failed unfunny comedian and somehow is expected to be taken seriously. By the way the scene with the Jolly Rancher will give me nightmares forever. I don't recommend this film to anyone and am very sorry I purchased it instead of renting it because I will never see it again. Still, it was good waiting out.

The plot (and I use that term VERY loosely with this movie) is just plain stupid! The ""tension"" between Superman is forced. Both of these superheroes are supposed to be good guys, so why do we see them being evil?

The scenes of the movie jump around so much that you are left wondering what is going on. The dialogue is ridiculous and there is zero character development. I have seen the actors in this movie in other films, and the do have talent, there us just so much you can do with the script and directing of this movie. For instance, when Lex Luthor has Superman's mother and is getting ready to fly away on the helicopter, why would our slightly dark superman not simply grab him and say ""I know you tole me you did not know where my mother is, but I am going to rip of your toes one at a time until you tell me. And if you make it through all 10 toes, we will move on to other appendages"" - Problem solved.

This movie seemed to be just a device to have prolonged action and fight scenes that were there for no apparent purpose for the violence. For instance, who is going to believe that Superman even needed a Seal Team to take out some of the bad guys when he rescues Lois? I guess the director needed another scene filled with unnecessary violence to make his ""plot"" flow. There is so much wrong with this movie, I just do not have the time to list it all.

Very generous of WB/DC to throw in an additional copy of the BVS regular cut. Unfortunately, I will most likely never watch the standard version again as the ultimate cut is so much more satisfying.

I didn't care for the dude who played Lex either. He was a little too crazy and over the top at times. Wonder Woman was probably the best character in this and not to mention Gal Galdot was gorgeous. The action was great, but the story wasn't very strong. Instead of doing the Batman backstory for the millionth time, I would've rather seen a Batman reboot first. Maybe explain why Batman has these visions, brands people, and why he didn't seem to have a problem with killing people. This could also have shortened this long movie. At the end of the day, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it could've been better. It was good for what it was, which was a prequel to the justice league movie.

7703232,4,B01D64VSYI,"THEATRICAL: What could I possibly say that thousands of people haven't already said? Probably not much, but I'll try. BATMAN V SUPERMAN was one of my most anticipated films this year, although the polarized reaction toward it certainly made me lower my expectations a little bit. One thing I noticed on first viewing was that the pacing was a little off, particularly in the first and last half hours. Early scenes seemed heavily edited, and it took way too long for the different narrative threads to come together. The central conflict, while built up satisfactorily, was almost anticlimactic and resolved way too quickly. To avoid spoilers, I won't divulge what happens afterwards, but it did feel very tacked on, almost an afterthought. Lastly, the action was over-CGI'ed and mind-numbing at times. It looked cool, but lacked heft and believability. Still, one has to admire the scope and ambition of Zack Snyder & Co. It touches upon some interesting philosophical themes, however lightly. It also has some great character moments/development, that build upon what MAN OF STEEL started. Ultimately, I look forward to seeing the story fleshed out more in the Extended Cut where, hopefully, the editing and pacing will be a little better. The only element I hated outright was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve movies was stupid, yes, but Eisenberg's rendition pushes it into extremely annoying territory. As for the score, it was appropriately epic and emotional when it needed to be. My favorite themes were, ironically, Lex's theme, and Wonder Woman's theme. All things considered, I liked the film despite its flaws, but it was undeniably messy and unwieldy.

ULTIMATE: This is the version I was waiting for. While it doesn't eliminate the flaws inherent in the theatrical cut, it features improved editing/pacing and provides much-needed connective tissue that fleshes out the story and makes it more comprehensible. The majority of the additional 30 minutes were placed before the title fight and expand upon the various investigations by Lois, Clark, and Bruce that lead up to the central brawl. Character motivations were made clearer (particularly Lex) and, more importantly, the narrative was able to breathe a little. I still think that Lex's plan was kind of stupid and ridiculously complex but, thanks to the extended running time, his role was diluted somewhat and made his presence a little more tolerable. There were also some additional shout-outs/fan service/references to the DC Universe, like Steppenwolf and Arkham Asylum. Overall, I still found myself cheering and tearing up at the same places, but this Ultimate Edition is definitely a step up from its theatrical counterpart and is a fuller, more satisfying story.

EXTRAS: Given that Zack Snyder went all-in in terms up setting up a larger DC Universe with BvS, it's only natural that the special features would do a lot to expand on that and delve into the characters we'll be seeing in the coming months/years. The first featurette goes into the characters who will make up the first cinematic incarnation of the Justice League, and some time is also devoted to talking a little about Suicide Squad. Subsequent featurettes go into the history of the DC Trinity (Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, for the uninitiated). However, my favorite (and, possibly, the most informative) was the one on the Batmobile. I was surprised on how functional the real-life vehicle was and how much they did practically in the film. Generally, though, the featurettes didn't go too much into the story/acting nor dig deeper than the average promotional material.

OVERALL: Zack Snyder really went for the fences with this one, and it shows. It's like he doesn't know how to make anything but an epic film at this point. While the theatrical cut felt incomplete and rushed on one hand, while still feeling overlong and bloated, the Ultimate Edition is able to course-correct by filling in gaps and providing additional information that makes the journey from 'A' to 'B' feel more logical and progress more naturally. Is it perfect? No, but it felt like more of a ""film."" This, and SUICIDE SQUAD (despite the critical drubbing so far) have me excited to see what more the DC Extended Universe has to offer. For those who held out on the theatrical version, this Ultimate Edition is the version to get (and, obviously, it provides the theatrical). For those who care/have the means, only the theatrical version is in 3D.",1470268800,,4514,5.072678331090175

I watched the movie at the theater when it came out, and it was a long snore feast until you get to the end of the movie.  The Batman - Superman fight was terrible and the movie didn't turn interesting until they banded together to go after Lex with the help of a few other heroes.

Civil War was a much better movie and flowed much better throughout the entire movie, though again I didn't care for the story arc of pitting the heroes against each other in Civil War.",1470268800,,584,4.243243243243243

Trust me I love anti-heroes like Wolverine, Snake from MGS, Batman, etc, but these guys are just blah. I even appreciate the darker tone, but again it just becomes blah. When Marvel started pumping out movies I felt they were a little cheesy, but now this is trying to be so serious that it ends up taking the cheesy award. Very sad, because I wanted to like this more. The scene with Superman in Washington was executed perfectly, but outside of that I remember just as much as my wife, who was asleep...",1470268800,,746,4.335714285714285
7703245,4,B01D64VSYI,"I'm in the minority here, in that I like this movie. The Ultimate Edition is probably, should be, the baseline for all reviews and judgment in my opinion. I knew going in that once it was announced I'd never see the theatrical cut. I mean, why would I? Anyway. I'm a fanboy and not ashamed to admit it, have been my whole life. That said - there are great parts of this movie and some that are...well, not so great.

Big tipoff for the ending is in the early scenes, a super Easter egg that I bet most missed because the reference is a generational one. Guys my age get it, others don't. I won't reveal it - but it's there for the picking. You just have to find it and decipher it.

I think Affleck is the best Batman so far. He's gritty and dark - the way it should be. He kills a lot of people, which I sort of want to move away from, but it's a realistic portrayal. I liked the sly nods to the Dark Knight Returns. That's the Batman I know and like.

Eisenberg is not as horrible as Luthor as he's been portrayed. Luthor is, should be, portrayed as a paranoid xenophobic lunatic, like Donald Trump. So I think the portrayal is spot on.

Gadot is great as Wonder Woman, but she does not get enough screen time or character dev. Cavill is probably the best Supes since Reeves and I like him a lot in the role.

Great fight scenes. Some plot holes that I won't go into here, but they are there. They have to be overlooked with effort. I'll admit that readily. Overall, it's a watchable movie. Clocks in long, but there's a lot to cover.",1470268800,2,1536,4.175675675675675

No one can be worse than Clooney, right? how bad can he be? What can I say...More gutted now than I was before. This was grade A awful. If DC is going to compete with Marvel, they are going to have to do so much better than the flattest Batman and the most self-righteous Superman. Mr. Affleck is so sedate, even in his fight scenes he seems sluggish. Batman is supposed to be wicked smart and a badass. Yet between the slowness of mind and body Mr. Affleck's Batman reminded me more of the troll from the first Harry Potter than the Dark Knight. The fact no one on set realized that is indicative of their lack of insight and awareness into the character. Don't even get me started on Henry Cavil. Looking ""pretty"" is just not enough, sir. These two actors were painful to watch. Even Ms. Adams, whose acting I normally enjoy, was flat at times and so very contrived in others. She just seemed startled the whole movie. The storyline was disjointed and bizarre. It was like a couple of kids got high, broke into a studio and thought they could just throw a script together with some juvenile characters lacking depth and personality, tossed in some CGI and the odd low cut dress and TA-DA--called it a movie. The directing was just terrible. Character development never rose above clichs. The story was a mess. The only good action involved Doomsday. The only redeemable character? Wonder Woman, in spite of the stereotypical dresses for Diana Prince. All I can do is grit my teeth and wait for a new Batman reboot.

Crude and rude, the ending really demeaned the whole franchise. I don't mind when film makers take a artistic license to propel a movie, taken from prewritten works and expand on those ideas, but when they stretch to the limits the actual series as set before in print, it really makes me less interested, in that picture show and any that comes after it, sad. Example; In the Fantastic Four, where the Torch becomes black and is What! Gay? And the ""Thing"" in caricature form is ridiculous.

Terrific character development, great action and cool acting.
The most iconic superheroes in the world in a grand, beautifully written opera.

I know many people claim that comic book characters should be light and fun but I wonder if they ever read comics.
The thousands of comics I read as a teenager (late 70's early 80's) were full of high-stakes drama, life and death situations not to mention destruction on a massive, sometimes cosmic scale.
The presence of humor did not turn these stories into comedy, it was serious stuff and that's just what I and so many others liked.
Batman V Superman captures all this perfectly, it's a love letter to superheroes.
Zack Snyder is probably the only author of the superhero film genre, he gets it.

7703260,3,B01D64VSYI,"[Spoiler Alert!]  Zack Snyder directs and all star cast in what was suppose to be an early summer blockbuster, but the movie was just a bust.  On opening weekend it grossed $166 million in North America, the 8th highest opening.  The movie had one of the biggest drops in movie history from one week to another, declining 81% in revenue.  This is all do to a poor critic response and fans of both, Batman and Superman, disagreeing with Snyders vision.

The movie is a follow-up to Snyder's mixed-reviewed, Man of Steel (2013).  Henry Cavill reprises his role as Superman/Clark Kent.  Hes loved for saving people and hated for being a powerful alien that previously wrecking Metropolis.  Ben Affleck take on the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, who is a killing vigilante that has a serious grudge against Superman and strange visions of the future.  Amy Adams again plays the hard-hitting reporter, Lois, whom Superman loves.  Jesse Eisenberg is miscast as Lex Luthor, who secretly pits Batman against Superman until they realize what his plot is.  Thrown in the mix is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Alfred (Jeremy Irons), Laurence Fishburne as Lois and Clarks boss, Holly Hunter as the senator backed by Luthor that wants Superman to pay for his crimes, and Diane Lane as Supermans Earth mom.  Snyder based his version of Batman on Frank Millers The Dark Knight Returns (1986).  He also threw in elements from the Death of Superman (1992) story arc.

Im not a comic reader, so my criticism and observations are based on hearsay and the previous movies.  For the most part this movie was criticized for being humorless and dark, where Batman kills people.  This only makes sense.  The Batman and Superman characters have been revamped over and over.  There have been the now classic TV Serieses about them, especially Adam West as Batman.  Tim Burton famously put Batman back onto the big screen with Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), which lead to a random franchise that starred George Clooney and Val Kilmer.  That also booted many cartoon adaptations.  Christopher Nolan came along and created his stylised trilogy that is equally as dark as Batman Vs Superman.  He gets praise, but his movies were full of plots holes, have Christian Bale with a horrendous voice, but gave way to Heath Ledger's amazing performance.  They tried to bring Superman back with the ultra-boring Superman Returns (2006) that didn't have the charming and comedic flare of the Christopher Reeves movies, Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980).  The other two movies in the Reeves series were atrocious.  With all the reboots and fans who love the comic books, Snyder was set-up for a failure no matter how he envisioned the characters.

Snyder had the daunting task of creating the DC Universe of characters, much like Marvel has been doing, and not everyone is going to be pleased with his decisions.  He needed to find a new way to keep the viewers entertained, so he went dark.  Batman in my eyes always had the potential to be a killer.  It only makes sense, since he has to work through some internal pain and basically is a vigilante.  In Batman Vs, Superman, Superman is still learning how to control his abilities and use them efficiently on the Earth, while he questions the mentality of people.  In this movie they are both learning what it is be a superhero.  I wouldnt be surprised if Afflecks Batman decides not to kill people in the next movie, as Superman learns how to be humorous like the Reeves movies.  After watching the fun and formulaic Marvel movies, I found the Batman Vs. Superman to be breath of fresh air, because it was different.  Deadpool (2016) could be an exception to the rule, as it was dark and humorous, but it was still very formulaic.

That said, Batman vs. Superman did have many problems cant be overlooked.  With such a powerful storyline of two titans facing off against each other, it was ruined by a relatively lame plot.  It added too many other elements and didn't add enough of the right ones.  I didn't mind that it was effects driven and a CGI enhanced movie. That is what one expects for the summer.  Look at any of the Marvel movies for example.  The main problem is Snyder.  His movies, including Watchmen (2009) which I enjoyed, are all style and no substance.  Its like Snyder carries around the Michael Bay playbook and follows precisely.  Every shot is cinematic, gleaming with in gorgeous visuals, but for no reason.  Theres no motivation or emotion behind most of the shots that warrant slow-motion, long tracking, or clever cinematography.  He also adds in his usual Jesus symbols and violence that he did with Watchmen and Man of Steel.  All that said, I will say that I enjoyed it more more than the recent Avengers movies and was entertained for what it was, a mindless summer blockbuster that had some story that will continue to the next movie in the franchise.",1470182400,,4903,4.783333333333333

very much looking forward to this coming-together of DC Comics leading-heroes on screen, have
enjoyed the fairly recent films with the ever improving Special-Effects to admire.
The film early-on and with flash-backs does reflect on 'Bruce Wayne's' (Ben Affleck) early years when
losing both parents.
We see 'Bruce' (Batman) unexpectedly invited to arch-villain 'Lex Luther's' (Jesse Eisenberg) party where
he will come across a mysterious and attractive woman 'Diana Prince' (Gal Gadot) who interfere's with
his unofficial investigation into 'Luther's' activities. ('Diana Prince' will prove a useful ally later on)
Back in 'Smallville' the activities of 'Batman' seemingly as a vigilante in 'Gotham' comes to the attention
of local reporter 'Clarke Kent' (Henry Cavill)...he is eager to investigate the claims.
At this time 'Alien' - 'Superman' has troubles of his own with his adoring public who begin to doubt him,
which 'Bruce' becomes aware of.
Well, one man has picked up on the distrust between the Super-Heroes and will fuel the doubt they have
between them and ensures they meet face to face....a  showdown becomes inevitable ......however the
World does need both, they must join forces to defeat the threat that has been engineered by 'Lex Luther'
Among the supporting cast - 'Amy Adams' plays 'Clarke Kent's' girlfriend 'Lois Lane'....'Jeremy Irons' plays
'Bruce Wayne's' loyal family-servant/aide 'Alfred'....'Diane Lane' plays 'Clarke's' Earth-Mother 'Martha Kent' and
'Lawrence Fishburne' plays the editor of the newspaper 'The Daily Planet' who both 'Clarke' and 'Lois' work
for.
Though the film does have some great action sequences as one would expect and many great and pleasing
moments along the way i did feel the story-line lost it's way from time to time....but at the end of the day it
is the coming together of DC's Super-Heroes 'Batman' and 'Superman' not forgetting the inclusion of 'Diana
Prince' (Wonder Woman) which fans will surely savour with great anticipation for what will surely come to
pass in the not to distant future.
Of course there is the array of Special-Effects and the impressive new Batmobile to savour along the way....
'The Ultimate Edition' comes with both the Theatrical-Version (151 minutes) and the ultimate-edition (182
minutes)
Features -
Uniting the World's Finest - Glimpse the future of DC's bold new cinematic heroes
Gods and Men - A Meeting of Giants - Justice meets vengeance when the two icons clash on-screen for the
first time ever.

7703263,1,B01D64VSYI,"Being a completest, I had to grab a hold of this movie even though I thought MAN OF STEEL was one of the most abysmal comic book superhero movies I'd ever seen. I guess I'm naive, but I kept thinking things cannot help but get better. WRONG.  Once again, director Hack...errr, excuse me, Zac Snyder  dishes up another steaming plate of superhero doo-doo. Whiny, humorless characters. Endless CGI- saturated scenes of distraction and chaos.  A depressing story line, filled with politically correct, left-wing sentiments.  All of this presented in dark,  muted colors-some of the scenes look like they were filmed in a coal mine.
***SPOILERS***  You know you're in trouble when the movie starts out with beloved iconic character Jimmy Olsen, being revealed as a CIA operative,  shot point blank in the head by yet another psychotic Middle Eastern terrorist. Things just go downhill from there, with some  self-appointed ""Guardian of the people"" Democrat senator from Kentucky , who's taken it upon herself to bring down Superman as being  responsible for all the woes of the American people-it's the usual left-wing,bleeding heart liberal mantra.  The only scene that made me laugh out loud in this grim tale took place when yet another whiny character -  an ex-Wayne Enterprises employee in an explosive laden wheelchair -  blows up an entire Senate hearing taking place in the Metropolis capitol building, killing everyone  except Superman!  But wait-there's more to come!  I won't go into detail except to say that I watched both the theatrical and the ""ultimate"" edition (30+ minutes longer) , and while the latter version explained more,  it didn't help improve an already depressing, ultra-violent hodgepodge of yet another film tailored to fans who love 3-D movies that are basically overlong video games tailored for the big screen.",1470182400,5,1839,5.141414141414141

7703283,3,B01D64VSYI,"My expectations weren't the highest going in to this movie due to the less than stellar press and reviews surrounding Bats v Supes initial release.  Overall it's entertaining if a bit of an endurance test due to the 2 1/2 hour runtime paired with the amount of characters and story crammed in.  I really feel that Zac Snyder was an unfortunate choice to helm this flick - his vision of the DC universe translates into a fairly bleak and dark world.  If DC ever makes movies for Lobo, Midnighter, or even Omega Men he'd be a great fit.

Dawn of Justice's Batman is drawn heavily from Frank Miller's DKR series from the 1980s (literally incorporating some scenes, dialog, and costume design from it).  Zac Snyder's Batman maims and brands his prey, outright kills numerous supporting baddies, and even wields a gun repeatedly.  Batman kills and uses a gun!  Mr. Snyder needs to expand his research beyond a single (non-canon) series from 30 years ago, even if it does pair well with his dark and highly cynical worldview.  Mr. Affleck did a surprisingly good job with what he had to work with.  Henry Cavill's take on Superman is fine.  It was a first to see the collateral damage caused by Superman's abilities.  This is something I felt the comics and other movies have danced around for years - when a super strong man throws another super strong man through a populated building there are consequences!  Wonder Woman was the high point frankly - Gal Godot was a great choice.  Jesse Eisenberg made some weird desicions with Lex Luthor.  He's too spastic and hyper, with a side schizophrenia, and all fuled by red bull and cocaine. Take it down a notch man. Luthor is a cool customer, not some sort of methed out nerd.

I really hope they rework the Flash's silly costume in this universe  - the brief glimpse of it here, then the reveal at comic con for the Justice League movie exposes everything wrong with DC's recent crop of movies.  It feels like all the things the CW's DC shows have gotten right - the costumes, the hero's values, the villains, and the respect for the source material - the people making the DC movies made a deliberate choice to ignore completely.

DC's properties go back 70+ years - that's almost a century's worth of material to pull from.  Unfortunately it feels like Mr. Snyder and crew have picked ideas from a very limited range of sources that fit his preexisting predilections for all things dark, grim, and gritty.  The aspirational ideals of DC's heroes barely make the cut in this movie.  I enjoyed the movie, but at times I barely recognized the characters portrayed here.  Hopefully DC makes better choices with their inevitable reboot 10 or so years from now.

*Whoever organized the 'len's flare' intervention for JJ Abrams needs to put one together to address Zac Snyder's use of slow motion. Enough dude! A little slo mo goes a long way.*",1470182400,4,2883,4.676587301587301
7703284,3,B01D64VSYI,I am not sure why we had to have all of the back stories when anyone who is a fan or just watched any of the previous movies would know it. When it comes to movies like this the fans want action. Wonderwoman was my favorite character and you don't get to see her fight until the end. And they don't explain her origins.

This is actually the beginning of DC's version of the Avengers. It introduces Wonder Woman and she kicks ass even more than Batman. I see Batman as more like Ironman because they're both must human. Although Iron man established himself much more valuable in Avengers than Batman did so far in the Justice League. The film is not as dark as others have indicated.

I don't have blu ray but would buy the blu ray, digital and dvd combo if it means having to watch the bonus features and ulmated edition only on digital.

7703298,3,B01D64VSYI,"This movie was obviously the result of too much filming/CGI development, that had to be drastically edited down to a feature length.
I expect that there were so many creative options that the writers went nuts, as did the director and producers, leaving an editing staff to sort through weeks worth of material to lay down the story.
It watches like a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces missing.  The overall effect of the story is that we understand the whole, even though there are massive gaps in the telling.  There are spots where editors just plain missed the mark, leaving glaring visual inconsistencies.
The easiest to spot is the graveyard scene.  Briefly, Lois Lane grasps a handful of soil from a mound by the burial site of Clark Kent, a pile of dirt under a piece of indoor/outdoor carpet.  That is often seen at graveyards, of course.  But in all the other shots, it simply does not exist.
Alex Luthor?  No society anywhere would have allowed him to keep breathing, after a mass killing, and creation of an invincible monster.  No matter how you spin the story, it is only a plot device, allowing for a character to return in later films.  Lame.",1470096000,,1155,4.655172413793103

Anyways, this movie isn't bad, it doesn't deserve to get as panned as the reviews gave it. It's a good movie, not a great, but it could have been way better; I am quite sure I'm just defending it since I love the DC Universe.
The Ultimate Edition gives it justice with the extra material that was left out (which should have been in the theatrical debut); the 3D edition doesn't give it justice, as it is only the theatrical edition and not the Ultimate Edition. I should have read more into it and it makes sense with the left out material they wouldn't have the ultimate edition option in the 3D, but that extra material gives the movie some justice to show it isn't that bad.

But, unlike the Marvel movies, that are most definitely fun to watch, this movie successfully creates an intricate storyline that sets the stage for the coming DC Cinematic Universe and highlighted by another great performance from  Henry Cavill as a  Superman that truly embrasses the modern Man of Steel; Amy Adams, in the extended cut, really gets to dig into what makes Lois Lane a great character; a STELLAR debut of Gal Gadot as a mysterious and powerful Wonder Woman (I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE WW MOVIE NEXT JUNE!!); and proving his critics WRONG, Ben Affleck gives us a Batman with a long history of struggle...and for some reason a shot of his ass in a brooding, shower scene.

7703314,2,B01D64VSYI,"I was hoping that the extended version would give me more,.. something.  The entire movie seems to be centered around specific moments that are meant to be iconic, but there's no emotion built behind these moments. This is a problem I have with most Zack Snyder films.  There's a lot time centered around creating iconic moments but not enough time building an emotional weight behind those moments to make us feel the iconicism of those moments. You know the next moment is meant to be a big one, an iconic one, a piece of art because the slow motion starts and the music swells, but it's hard to feel anything other than the emotions the music causes when you don't care about these characters other than the fact that in your mind you know their history. A film should build an attachment to the characters within the construct of the film, not just rely on the audiences predisposed attachment due to the character's history in pop culture thus far. You're attached to Bruce Wayne/Batman, not because of Batfleck (even though I genuinely thought he was good in this) but because of the good will built up by Christian Bale's version which did a lot of damage control in a post-bat nipple world. You feel attachment to Superman not because of the film but because he's been a part of pop culture for a while now as the consummate hero.  I personally feel no attachment to Superman, I like my superheroes flawed and motivated by a sense of heroism more akin to Batman.

Not too mention that I feel like I was promised a lot more Wonder Woman than what I actually got.  That, while I know it's billed as a Batman/Superman film, putting her front & center on the cover/posters was a promise that she's be in more of this film.  The film spent the majority of it's time with her focusing on Wonder Woman's alter-ego Diana Prince (which I believe I only know from previous information, I don't think they ever actually introduce her by name, either her 'real world' name or her superhero name) as a 'hot girl in a pretty dress', but I did appreciate the swooping in to save the boys moment.

I feel like this movie could have been better, but in order to do so there needs to be someone else in charge. Someone else who's sole focus isn't creating individual iconic moments meant to stand apart from the rest of the film and then manipulating the film to get to those moments.  Everything was in service of the moment, there wasn't any scene building just a build to a moment and then when it was over it was the next build to the next moment.  Stylistically the film was very beautiful, but from the point of view of a story it was a mess. I've spoken to a lot of people that found the storyline confusing, can't tell you anything about what actually happened within the story except for those few moments when the music swelled and they were told by the filmmaker that this was a moment to remember and only this.  That's not a way to make a film and it's definitely not a way to create the emotion needed to back up a film.

DC is struggling in the aspect so much more than Marvel because marvel has taken them time to create an emotional attachment to each of it's characters.  The Marvel films aren't just superhero movies they have plotlines than transcend that, and DC would be wise to take that into consideration. Plotlines are what made audiences fall in love with these superheroes, not just the geek audiences but everyone.  I know little to nothing about superheroes outside what I've seen in the theater.  I like hero movies but I'm not about to commit myself to following them in their comic book form, and I know that there are A LOT of people that feel the same, so it's important to make sure that you're capturing that audience as well and not just catering to those who read all the comics.",1470096000,10,3808,4.476190476190476

7703391,1,B01D64VSYI,"The Movie.
I couldn't wait to see this movie. But it ended up to be just wrong on so many levels:
1. The Director is REALLY into action and visuals. For example, Superman can't even land without breaking a city block of sidewalk. It looks cool but why? The Director is so much into action and visuals that he had no space for a decent plot, motivation, and character development.
2. In a movie called Batman v Superman you'd think they'd explain just WHY these two guys are fighting. But they don't. Even they know that so at the last minute they installed (spoiler) the Lex Luther kidnaps Clark's mom and says kill the bat or I kill your mom.
3. The reason BvS stop fighting is the most hilarious part of the movie. (Spoiler) It's because Superman yells, ""Martha!"" Within 1 minute of yelling that, they stop fighting and they are best buds.
4. The Director put his ego before the movie. Reporters asked Christian Bale why he wasn't Batman. He said he wasn't asked. The Director later said that it wasn't true, that he did ask Christian Bale to be in the movie - as Alfred the butler!
5. If Warner Brothers wants any of this to work, they need to get rid of the Director.

Digital HD with Ultraviolet.
Ultraviolet means 1. it won't download through iTunes and 2. if you try to stream it through Ultraviolet, it will stop every five minutes.

The characters are terribly undeveloped and have one-dimensional motivations that don't really make sense. There's an army of special effects that I guess are supposed to make up for the bad plot and worse characters. Even the fight scenes were pitiful with a number of enemies clearly just standing around waiting for their turn to get punched.
If you have knowledge of the superheroes and villains in this movie, just don't watch it. It will be nothing but a disappointment.
This is simply a movie for people that don't want any thought in movies and lots of special effects, cashing in on classic characters along the way.
So unless you're one of those people, I do not recommend it.",1469923200,2,794,4.760869565217392
7703420,4,B01D64VSYI,"This, even more than Man of Steel, is really the big launch into the DC Universe series of movies.  DC took the opposite approach from Marvel, and instead of putting out multiple origin stories first, then assembling a team, DC put out one origin story, Superman's in this universe, then started bringing the other characters together.  Then, the plan between Justice League movies is to tell some of the individual stories.  What results is this being part sequel to Man of Steel, part intro to Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Batman, Flash etc stand alone movies to come, as well as setting up the Justice League.

The movie starts at the end of Man of Steel, showing the fight between Zod and Superman from Bruce Wayne's perspective while he is racing toward one of his buildings in Metropolis, which is interestingly just across the bay from Gotham City in this incarnation of the story (which I personally was not a fan of), while the city is being destroyed.  3/4 of the movie are really showing how events are being orchestrated by Lex Luthor, played wonderfully by Jesse Eisenberg, which ultimately leads to the fight between Batman and Superman, and eventually involves Wonder Woman, which I believe was very well done by Gal Gadot whom a lot of people (including me) were skeptical of being able to pull the role off, and Doomsday.  I will not spoil the end of the movie, but if you are familiar with Doomsday from the comic, you pretty much can figure out where the story goes.  I think the introduction of Doomsday was not really necessary for this movie.  I think it could have been solely about the take down of Lex and devoting a bit more time to the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg characters, who were all little more than cameos in the film, even the extended version.

I think Ben Affleck did a great job as an older, more bitter Bruce Wayne/Batman.  I think he got a bad rep for the Daredevil movie, which was bad because of factors that went way beyond him at a time when superhero movies were not taken as seriously by the studios as they are now, but his portrayal, in my opinion, rivaled Christian Bale and Michael Keaton as the best movie portrayals of the character.  While I would have not had a problem with Bale returning to the role, because Man of Steel established this as a different universe than that one, it makes it easier to buy into regardless of how close in time the movie is to the end of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.  I do think how you ultimately feel about the movie will be reflected by how into the comics you were.  I have not read any of the comics or the graphic novels, even though I know of some of them.  You will have to accept that they dropped things like the Superman and Batman never kill that the comics and previous movies established. I think that is likely easier the less experience with the comics you have.  Many of the ancillary characters from Man of Steel reappear, with some new ones as well.  Amy Adams has the largest role among them as Lois Lane, and her character is set up for seemingly an even larger role down the line.  Laurence Fishburne and Diane Lane return to their roles, although somewhat abbreviated, and Holly Hunter is added as a senator who is dogging Superman.

For those who get this blu ray set, there are three discs.  The theatrical and ultimate editions get their own blu ray discs, and the theatrical version of the movie is included on regular DVD.  There are no extras on the ultimate edition disc (aside for a trailer for the animated Killing Joke disc), and all the extras (over two hours of behind the scenes and making of featurettes ranging from about 7-25 minutes) are included on the theatrical version disc, as well as a trailer for Suicide Squad.  There are also a couple features devoted to the larger DC movie universe to come.  The ultimate edition, which is R rated, adds about 30 more minutes to the story, ultimately fleshing out more of the story, but really does not change anything from the theatrical version.  And no, you do not get more of the other Justice League characters in the extended edition.

As one can see from the reviews, people are all over the place in terms of liking or hating this movie.  Overall, I liked it, aside from the points I made previously, which caused me to knock it down a star.  While I do not think it is perfect, and would have liked them not ignoring the stellar DC television universe, despite the hardships of blending the two, I think that is one area where Marvel does a better job.  The A/V quality of the discs are great as you would expect, and you do get a ton of bonus material for those who like going through that material.  While I cannot say that everyone will like this movie, I would say if you liked Man of Steel, chances are you will like this.  If you like the characters overall, and can accept that there have been changes in this adaptation, then you will likely enjoy this.  If not, then then chances are you will not be all that enamored with this.",1469923200,7,5014,4.496141124586549
7703421,3,B01D64VSYI,"I went in to this with low expectations based on the myriad of reviews and scores and came out the other end wishing this was handled more like the Avenger series, and the movies that lead up to those film endeavors. While Batman and Superman have been established and are obviously well worn territory in terms of origin, plight, and relationships, we are left with a gap that is marginally filled in within the movie's run-time.

I liked Ben Affleck's older, less agile take on Batman. However his blind anger towards Superman seems out of character for such an intelligent, calculating, and brooding man. I'm aware that there is a comic book thread that this is based on, and I have not read it but I feel like a character like Batman would need more provocation to hold such a ignorant grudge. Lex Luther finds out Superman's secrets fairly quickly without any explanation, yet Batman (the great detective) knows nothing. The conflict between the two characters is resolved too quickly and I feel like it was done so just to fit the feature length of the film. I've been told the Director's Cut treats this situation with a little more thought.

While Wonder Woman was a great addition I felt like her origin story film should have been released first, or at least she should have had less of a role in the film. I'm assuming her insertion in this movie was to gauge audience reaction and whether to greenlight her own solo film.

To make a long story short, I liked the characters and it is visually a fun movie to watch, however I feel like they forced too much story in a single movie. This seems like a stop-gap solution to make the Justice League.",1469923200,2,1656,4.569023569023569

This movie was a continuous attack upon the right in a world of right and wrong. Movies like this are a terrible reminder to me of just how many evil bugs are out there in my World.

7703423,4,B01D64VSYI,This is a good movie. I feel that it has some holes in it and just misses the mark as it tries to compete with Marvel. They try to develop characters and fall short. We have lived through the starting store of batman almost as many times as we have seen Peter Parkers ascent to man wearing spandex super hero yeah! Forgetting other movies and just getting lost in this movie made it a great experience. It helps that at least DC offers their new movies in 4K which Marvel still has yet to do. The quality is really outstanding especially in HDR and I would recommend it for anyone who is a little pixel friendly out there looking to get the most out of their 4k screen and is bored of just watching YouTube in 4k or Breaking Bad this is a great addition to a small but growing 4k Library.,1469923200,2,788,4.190789473684211

7703431,2,B01D64VSYI,"I really wanted to like this movie, and the actors and action are okay. But the script was rather linear and didn't make a good case for what compels Batman to pick a fight with Superman.  In a sense, one character played the role of a the typical villain that we see in superhero movies: misguided, simple-minded, and somehow thinking it's their life mission to engage the other one in battle.  Various villains from the Spider-man movies come to mind.  Now give that villain a bat suit and call him Bruce Wayne, and that's pretty much what the movie felt like.

Another aspect that didn't quite make sense was Batman's sadistic blood lust.  He blows up alleged criminals and uses their cars to smash and kill other alleged criminals.  He lifts Superman by the head as if to snap his neck, and repeatedly smashes his face in.  There's no attempt to subdue and arrest, just to mutilate repeatedly.  It's kind of like the Terminator 2 movie where the liquid metal Terminator is smashing in Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator in the face with a steel beam.  I know Batman isn't supposed to be squeaky clean and by-the-book, but the way he's portrayed, he just looks like typical villain in a bat suit.  The only thing that makes him pause before stabbing Superman to death is because both of them have a mother named ""Martha.""

The movie is also not subtle enough with their promotion of future films and other characters.  There's a lengthy section where Wonder Woman is watching 'trailers' that introduce other Justice League characters.  After a while I forgot what movie i was watching.  Also, whenever Wonder Woman appears, the theme music changes abruptly to the one that is used for her future movie.  The tone of the Wonder Woman theme song is fine on its own, but is totally different from the theme of the rest of the movie.  So again, it kind of makes the audience feel like they're being interrupted by a commercial break or a separate movie trailer.",1469923200,,1960,4.687134502923977

7703443,1,B01D64VSYI,"Stilted and bloated. The movie is posture and not substance. This is not the Batman and Superman of the comics it is the most somber and lifeless incarnation of the franchise to date. The story staggered along in a boring disjointed drunken stagger that truly is a wonder because with all the creativity and talent within that studio this sad entry is the best concoction they could present. Zack Snyder has proven time and again he will always go for style over substance. In fact the best version of Batman and Superman take is Batman and Superman: World's first, which is a thoroughly enjoyable and much more accurate to the soul of these DC icons. I know people have done many comparisons to the Marvel franchise and they should because they have shown with every stride how its done in fact if you look at the more edgy Fox Marvel take if that's the route they wish to go for they should take stock of Deadpool and X-Men: First Class.
So to sum up the brain trust of DC cinematic universe should seriously review their plotted course because right now its movies like these that wear the comic franchise out and it will take a monumental effort to get peoples arses in seats. Repeats of mass destruction, bad dialogue, lifeless acting and staged action can we go through before we stop going. I for one am glad i only rented it and even that hurts to know they got some of my money for something clearly not worthy of this iconic franchise.

This is the case in the big fight between our 2 heroes. It might have been avoided had one explained to the other what he had to do. I know, I know, the whole movie was based on the fight between them, but still, it ruins it for me.

Dawn of Justice, to me, feels like what this genre of movie has been missing. I've been a fan of both marvel and dc since I was a child, and it's great to see both universes realized on the screen.

7703659,2,B01D64VSYI,"A lackluster follow up to Man Of Steel. Jesse Eisenberg proved many right by playing Luthor as a maniac, resembling no Luthor ever with unclear motives for causing rampant chaos. His portrayal would be more at home in a Schumacher Bat-film. Cavill is solid but given almost nothing to-do except look severe and arguably constipated. Affleck is.....in the movie. This Batman can actually move when he (finally) fights. The title skirmish is too short, repetive, and occurs for a truly asinine reason, almost as stupid as why it ends.

Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is superb. This Themyscaran Princess is a WARRIOR, whom seems to relish battle. I look forward eagerly to her solo outing based on her limited screen time here.",1469923200,,719,4.9421487603305785

7703661,4,B01D64VSYI,"I was honestly expecting a train wreck. Thankfully it wasn't. For starters I thought BA was a horrible choice as Batman. As was GG as Wonder Woman. I was wrong about both. Both handle their roles quite well actually. This is the problem caused by the Bale/Nolan movies. The bar was set so high that I didn't think anyone could out do them. So instead of jumping the bar, Snyder and Ben sidestepped it altogether by creating a dark knight that was compelling, convincing and interesting enough to stand on his own. Wonder Woman was awesome in every way.

The villains were hit and miss for me. Lex was awesome but Doomsday honestly looked like a giant flying orc.

Basically the film was perfectly cast, wonderfully acted with a great score. The film has Snyder's various visual flavors. It looks great.

The direction is where they lost me. Underneath this hulking giant is a stellar film. My main gripe was the editing. There's no reason the film couldn't have been trimmed. Really? How many times do we have to see Batmans intro? Beyond that I would have ditched Doomsday and increased Luthor' s character.

If you can overlook the pacing and a story that's all over the place then yes, there's a great film here. I honestly enjoyed this more than Avengers 2.

7703668,4,B01D64VSYI,"First off, I am the BIGGEST Superman fan, ever. I have George Reeves and Noel Niell autographed photos... and all the movies.
Batman, not much. As a matter of fact, I never owned any of the Batman flicks until I got a great PRIME DAY DEAL on the first
two Batman movies in a 7 film Tim Burton Blu-ray Collection for $20. I'll watch the Batman movies after I get done watching the
movies I wanted. I ramble... well, anyway... Batman is NOT a favorite. I'm 67. I never bought the comics when they were less than
a quarter. Wouldn't pay a dime for one now. Batman is NO super-hero: he's just a VERY rich guy with TOYS... but no ""Iron Man"".
In this movie, nit-pickin' can ruin the experience. I watched the 2D, extended, cut first.... having never seen the film.
The Bat Man character is a cruel man. He schemes to kill Superman... until he finds out in a key-scene that their mothers share the
same name. So, Bat Man is more the Lex Luthor villian, and Lex Luthor is just a snotty-kid suicide-bomber. I liked the end of the movie
where ""hope"" will restore Bat Man a-n-d, hopefully, Superman.
To distractors WITH 3D Blu-ray players: In the SAME way that I watch movies that I like, such as ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN
with the ""2D to 3D"" button on----
(McDoogal's House of Horrors LOOKS great in 3D!)----so does the flat extended-cut of Batman vs. Superman... if you don't have too big of a TV.
BOTH of the last two men to play Superman on the, so-called, GIANT screen have had less than super... teeth.

That's a shame, because it was the chopped up, barely coherent cut of the film that I think left ticket buyers cold. I certainly walked out of the cinema with mixed feelings.

This cut corrects all of the things that had me scratching my head before, and flows much better. It still has too much packed into it, and it still was made too soon (we should have gotten a solo Batman flick and another Superman movie before this one), but at least it is a well made movie that holds together.

this could have been a cinematic event in history which has two icons on the big screen together for the first time in history instead it becomes the one the worst comic book ever movies ever even worse than Joe Schumacher's Batman and Robin.

I normally don't agree with critics but this is one of the few times they are right. I don't care what any DC Fanboy or Zack Snyder family has to say about it this movie is awful. so many missed opportunities and now thanks to the incompetence of Zack Snyder. the DC Cinematic Universe can't do the death of Superman story arc on the big screen because they killed him in the second movie in the universe what the wtf.

I don't care if the extended Cut is better than the  version that was shown in theaters that is not mean it automatically is a good movie because of it it's not it's still a train wreck. there's so many plot holes in this movie I can't even list them because this review would be too long.

don't see this movie unless you're curious because all of this is a waste of time and wasted opportunities. I hope to God Zack Snyder when his contract is up he never goes near the DC Universe ever again.",1469836800,3,1297,4.234817813765182

All the negative reviews I have heard seem to talk mostly about how dark and gritty the story and characters are. They keep comparing to Marvel movies and want them to have a lot more jokes, bright colors etc. Personally I am more of a fan of Frank Miller style comics and the ""Ka-pow"" style Batman comics.

This felt like a more adult super-hero movie, the action was great. The plot was a little convoluted because it's trying to setup a ton of story lines for Justice League and all the other DC movies coming. But I thought it all made sense, and the characters actions were justified. More so than in Civil War, where they all just seem to turn on each other at the drop of a hat.

I personally love the Marvel movies, but I do not want the DC movies to just be more of the same. I don't want it to be all pretty, and making silly jokes. In Marvel movies I never feel the tension, it feel too PG.

This movie is dark, tense and I can't wait for more. I really hope DC does not buckle too much and try to Marvelize their movies. Keep them dark and different.",1469836800,3,1336,4.166666666666667

This movie offers a refreshing alternative to the Marvel Universe, it's gritty, dark and very fulfilling. The movie might feel choppy, but we have been primed by the Marvel's narrative of a comic-book movie (An evil collusion, individual conflicts, coming together because of necessity, rationing on-screen time for characters, ""the earth has never faced a threat like this before"",an ensemble fight scene (where we realize the alien\robot things are made of plastic )  and semi-closure of the conflicts introduced). This movie creates an essential realism, the threats feel very real, a lot of people die (since, that would happen in a universe filled with Meta-beings and aliens) and even the conflict feels very natural. The screen-play do expect the audience to connect the dots, it is natural for Batman to be vary of an all powerful being. He has seen\known that good people might not stay good and that is a huge problem in case of a God like being. The casting is perfect, Ben Affleck is the best batman ever.

When Superman went to finish off Doomsday, it brought back memories of the early '90s, when I read the Doomsday story in the comic books, all the way up through Superman #75: The Death of Superman. They've got to make a sequel to this, in which Superman comes back! If they do, and they decide to follow the old comic books by having four super-powered beings show up, each wearing Superman's shield and claiming to be Superman, back from the dead, I wonder how they'll do it and who they will get to play Steel, Superboy, Eradicator & the Cyborg.

7703720,5,B01D64VSYI,I love the entrance of Diana Prince (Wonder woman )  Was very disappointed that Superman was written to die.  It Actually was a bizarre ending,1469836800,3,142,4.64
7703721,5,B01D64VSYI,"I saw this movie 3 times in the theater and was more impressed each time. The ultimate edition fills in some gaps, so definitely see that. Ben Afleck is the best Batman ever. Henry Cavill is a tainted
hero since the ending of ""Man of Steel"". (This movie starts during that final battle.) Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is a real person with a psychotic mind and a believable backstory and is, as a result, the most menacing incarnation of Lex Luthor yet. I initially had my doubts about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, but the moment she joins the battle and stands shoulder to shoulder with Batman and Superman, she is breathtaking! She IS Wonder Woman!

The critics panned this movie harshly. I really don't know what they were smoking! Marvel has established an inner circle of superhero movies that are real drama as well as being action-adventure. This movie stepped into that inner circle and took the lead. I am so looking forward to the series of great movies that the next year and a half are promising.

Zack Snyder, you have made a masterpiece here! Do not listen to the carpers and nay-sayers. Thank you for myself and the many others that ""get it""!

Ben, Henry, Jesse and Gal, thank you and see you in the movies!",1469750400,3,1219,4.557077625570776

The character development was  weak. I have no idea why Batman and Superman were at each others throat ? Weak script and average special  effects made it even harder to enjoy. It seemed that Superman had a permanent frown!! Man of steel was in serious need of some facial cream. Affleck was ok .He was show cased throwing free weights around and doing chin ups with no shirt on in one scene while 10 seconds later he was fully dressed moving towards the bat cave computer system with brooding eyes. The she hero character was pretty but I am not sure why she was there at all and the villain monster was so fake and digital and devoid from any emotions that you really could't even muster the courage to dislike him . And Superman's love Lois couldn't even shed a real tear when superman d.lets not spoil the ending . But then again maybe we should . To me the best Batman movies  were the the first and the last three before this nightmare . I really didn't care much for Clooney at all nor for Afflack.

This film should have had at least a solo Batman film to flesh out this new universe instead of just the single Superman film and jump right into AVENGERS ASSEMBLE done in a terribly sloppy, slow and  completely uninteresting manner.

Jesse Eisenberg is NOT a supervillian. How this scrawny, stoner of a joke was cast as Lex Luthor is beyond me.

Throw your money at the Marvel Cinematic Universe for real super hero action because that's the only place you're going to find it.

7703809,5,B01D64VSYI,"I am reviewing the Ultimate Edition Blu-ray + Theatrical Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD UltraViolet Combo Pack.

Movie Thoughts:
This movie is a masterpiece. I saw this movie three times in the theater. This means a lot, because in my three decades of movie-going, I never returned to see the same movie more than once in theaters... until this movie!

Theatrical version vs Ultimate Edition:
The Ultimate Edition, which is half-an-hour longer than the theatrical release, does more than simply add extra scenes to the existing movie - this hugely improves on the theatrical release. It clarifies character motivations, clears up confusing parts, even adds in extra action moments. Nothing to complain about here!

Ultimate Cut Rated-R?
- Violence: As far as I can see, pretty much the only reason the Ultimate Edition got an R rating, instead of the PG-13 of the Theatrical Cut, is because there's some additional blood in the action scenes, such as when people get shot, but nothing excessive at all. That's it. To raise the rating for this reason alone seems silly. Aside from that, the ultimate cut is really no more violent than the theatrical cut. For comparison, I'd say The Dark Knight (2008), which was rated PG-13, felt far more violent than either cut of Batman V Superman.
- Language: There's a couple of F-bombs not seen in the theatrical cut, once by a cop and once by Scoot McNairy's character.
- Sex/Nudity:"" Very safe and tame, same as the theatrical cut. There's an additional shot of Clark taking off his shirt in ""sexy bathtub scene,"" but that's the only difference from the theatrical cut. Nothing to shield your kids' eyes from.

Digital HD UltraViolet:
Don't ignore the UltraViolet code that comes with this set. You may wonder why you'd want to redeem a digital version if you've already bought the Blu-ray, but there are plenty of benefits here. You can watch the digital version on other devices, such as phones. UltraViolet lets you share your digital movie with your friends as long as they have their own accounts. It's pretty cool. The code I got with my Blu-ray expires in 2020, so be sure to redeem your code before then.

DVD:
Well, the DVD (theatrical cut) is included along with the Blu-ray... Nothing much to say here... Seems silly to include the DVD when we already have the Blu-ray.

Special Features:
The Man of Steel Blu-ray (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-of-Steel-Blu-ray/dp/B008JFUPK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man of Steel (Blu-ray)</a>&nbsp;), was incredibly jam-packed with content, so I would have expected the Batman V Superman Blu-ray set to be on the same level... but unfortunately the Batman v Superman Blu-ray special features are more limited.

The features that are here are decent enough - there are several good featurettes looking at the histories behind the characters, some looks at the stunts and effects; the Batmobile featurette, showing how the new Batmobile was designed and built, is the highlight... but here's what's lacking among these features: No commentary???! This is my biggest complaint, because I really wanted to hear what Zack Snyder, the cast, etc., had to say about the movie. The Man of Steel Blu-ray had probably the best commentary I've seen for a movie (Warner Bros did a really cool audio/visual commentary that they called a ""Maximum Movie Mode""), so I'm disappointed that they didn't even bother to include a commentary here. Plus there isn't a truly in-depth behind-the-scenes making-of feature for the movie that goes deeper than the short featurettes. I like the short little featurettes we got here, and I definitely don't regret purchasing this great movie on Blu-ray, but I wanted more special features than this.",1469664000,2,3753,5.122549019607843

I saw the film on a movie theater. And I loved it. So I decided to purchase the Blu-Ray.

I am really disappointed that paid more for the 3D version just to be scammed with it. The ultimate (extended) movie is only on the 2D Blu Ray. The front cover only mentions that on a very small part of it. It is obviously trying to hide that fact since on the main title it shows ""3D ultimate edition"".

My son in law really wanted to see this, so I rented it, and was pleasantly surprised. There were a few hokey bits (Batman doesn't kill Superman because their mothers had the same name?) but overall it was enjoyable, had a decent plot, and good action scenes. This is high praise from one who couldn't watch all of the last Superman movie. DC may do better in their ensemble pieces, like Suicide Squad or the Justice League. The teasers for the JLA looked pretty good, and Gal Gadot made a kick ass Wonder Woman, who enjoyed the fight.

So make up your own mind, that's what makes America great.....",1469664000,,739,4.474074074074074
7703823,5,B01D64VSYI,"One of the darker and most epic comic book adaptations to come out, Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice starts off parallel with the ending minutes in Man Of Steel, with Superman's battle with General Zod and his army being witnessed from a bit different perspective than what we saw in MOS.  We see events from the ground level, the way ordinary people would witness the battle, with one of the 'ordinary people' being Bruce Wayne, outside of his identity as Batman.  Flash forward 18 months.  Wayne, who's already been Batman for years but has existed in the shadows and off the radar of the media, is obsessed with what he sees as the potential threat of Superman.  He's not alone.  Ever since the end of Man Of Steel, Superman has been keeping up his neverending battle against crime and evil, but some of the world's populace is seeing him in ways Superman himself never anticipated.  A small but vocal minority see him as a threat, and others view him as not just a champion but a god.  Enter into this situation an elaborate conspiracy to frame Superman for the deaths of innocent civilians in a war-torn African nation, and we have a big problem.

Its two title characters are front and center, but the movie also acts as a real ground zero for opening up the scenario beyond MOS into a launch for the onscreen DC Universe (similar to how Marvel so successfully did with the first Avengers movie and its precursors a few years ago).  The presence of Wonder Woman was highly touted for months prior to the film's theatrical release, but other characters and ideas also show up in unexpected ways, making this movie a treat especially for longtime DC fans.  The handling of the movie's characters is a little bit surprising.  Henry Cavill as Superman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman are both quite close to how they appear in the comics, Wonder Woman a bit harder perhaps, but others are more different.  Batman (played by Ben Affleck) is a darker, more extreme character than in either the comics or the Dark Knight movie trilogy, not seeming particularly bothered how many of his enemies end up dead.  I don't know how this will play out longterm if they don't have the character develop in a slightly less violent direction, but for this one movie it works very well.  Amy Adams makes a good Lois Lane, just like she did in MOS.  It's in Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of a young Lex Luthor that we get perhaps the most unexpected characterization.  Not only younger but more eccentric, more manic, seeming at times almost like a cross between the traditional Lex Luthor and the Joker.  I would have thought this approach would fall on its face but it doesn't, and it fits into the larger DC Universe they're building very nicely.

One way Batman Vs. Superman fits with Man Of Steel is that both give perhaps the most plausible depictions of how a battle between beings of these power levels would look if it actually took place in the real world, in the middle of a real city.  No matter how hard the heroes try or how well-intentioned they are, significant collateral damage isn't just possible but likely.  At the same time, it establishes that the good guys couldn't just sit back and not act against a potentially planet-threatening situation.  In Man Of Steel it was Zod and his army and here...well, I don't want to give any spoilers away.  Dawn Of Justice is one of the best superhero movies ever made, although admittedly a bit intense for younger viewers.  If this is any indication of how the continuing rollout of the DCU is going to be, I'm looking forward to it immensely.",1469664000,2,3591,4.629337539432177

Obviously, that is what puts people in the seats. Ben Affleck has been good to great in some other roles. Argo was a great film. I don't know that any version of Batman has really tapped into the psyche of Bruce Wayne. The Michael Keaton and Christian Bale portrayals were also good but also understated and I don't think Bruce Wayne is a sullen, stoic figure. The rage within the character is always repressed. There are always glimpses but the character is always reeled back in. I do not know if that is the direction, the script, or the limitations of the actors.

7703857,3,B01D64VSYI,"True this is not a great movie however if you have the time the extended version helps the plot a little. Yes, Superman is a bore and a idiot. Which stems from the fact that he needs to fight Batman with the motivation that his mother is held hostage by Lex Jr. You'd think that a man with the abilities of Superman might come up a a little better plan.

The plot meanders all over the place (Zack Snyder is totally clueless about how to structure a coherent movie. (Also see Man of Steel). Saving Lois out of the blue several times, Clark investigating Batman, Batman having nightmares, Lex Jr. and the Senators etc... Characters act not out a real motives (like what's Lex Jr.'s problem?) but twisted plot lines.

Now I thought the Man of Steel had a little more heart in it than this but about the same amount of destruction. After all how many times can a city rebuild from billions of dollars of destruction? New York took years just to figure out who owned the WTC properties.

Frequently I will FF through sections of a film (after having viewed it a couple of times) to cut out the uninteresting sub-plots. Can't do that in this film because it is NOTHING BUT SUB-PLOTS. There is no organic scenes, nothing grows from a previous scene in the film in a natural way.

I don't want to overthink this film. After all it is just a superhero movie. It's just that it's not up to the level of Nolan's Batman, the last couple of Captain Americas or even the throwback X-Men films.

Maybe it's the writers.

I suspect it Zack Snyder.

It seems he loves FX and turns his films into FX marathons. Zack next film is the Justice League Part 1. If it turns out to be the same kind of mess this film was and I suspect it will be (it was hard for Joss Whedon to juggle so many characters) then Zack will never direct another DC movie.

Of course, since Batman has no superpowers, you would think that this would be a pretty easy fight.  However, kryptonite gives Batman a fighting chance.
OK, now that the nerding out is over, here's a few other points.  The superman character is too emotionless.  Lex Luthor is a goofball, more fit to be an inmate in an insane asylum than a super villian.  No menace at all.  As for the ""monster"", it was just goofy.  All in all, only the Batman character, who wanted to protect the world of humans from the superhuman invader, Superman, is played well.  It's OK, but hasn't this comic book stuff gone on long enough?  Time to grow up.",1469664000,,863,4.39873417721519
7703865,3,B01D64VSYI,"This one is a bit hard to rate, as there is a lot that is good and a lot that deserves criticism.
(Spoilers ahead - you've been warned)

My first criticism is that the extended version is only on Blu-ray and not on DVD. I did get to see it because of the HD digital copy, but I wanted to be able to watch it on my DVD player.

Second criticism involves comparing the Ultimate extended version (great) to the theatrical version (mediocre). All I can wonder is what were the editors thinking? They choose to include that confusing foreshadowing dream sequence that is little more than a teaser for the Justice League movies, yet they cut all the background scenes that actually give us the details of Lex Luther's plan, around which the whole plot of the movie is based? No wonder the movie got such low ratings in the theater. It's like they edited it to deliberately make it more confusing.

Character wise, I think this was the best Batman on film to date. This is a driven, intense Batman/Bruce Wayne that is waging a war on crime in his city. We also, however, get to see the ""World's Greatest Detective"" a little bit as Bruce actually does do investigative work as well as kicks ass. My only problem was that the costume was a bit of a let down, especially after the Dark Knight series.

Wonder Woman was a nice touch. The actress is beautiful, and exotic enough to believe that she is from some hidden away island of amazons. The custom is also probably the first that was not embarrassingly similar to a shoulder-less swimsuit.

Superman was annoying in this film. While I liked him in Man of Steel, here he is far too hypocritical. For instance, he is all bent out of shape about Batman ""abusing"" the civil rights of the criminals of Gotham (to the point of showing how the criminal Batman brands is a father and family man and it was just so unfair what happened to him, blah, blah, blah - give me a break, the guy was a human trafficker). Meanwhile, Superman kills a man (I imagine being flown through a wall is quite fatal) that he could have easily disarmed with his super speed. So it is OK to decide who gets to live or die when Lois's life is at stake, but a bunch of foreign girls going into the sex slave trade don't matter so much?

Of course, than there is the hypocrisy of the US government in the movie and the whole ""holding Superman accountable"" for the deaths in that village, where he killed only one man, and not the rest. Um, isn't this the same village that the government was going to wipe off the map with a drone strike, killing not only the armed terrorists, but all the civilians as well? Even if Superman HAD killed them, as Lex made it look, he still would have caused less death than the government plan.

Than there are little nitpicks like Perry White treated Clark like a jerk, and pushing him to write a sports story. Really? The Planet does not have an on staff sports writer already? And Batman is not news worthy? Really?

The beginning was well done, with the destruction from the first movie seen from the perspective of the people caught in the devastation. That fight did not feel real in the first movie as there was just too much destruction going on, but seeing it through Bruce Wayne's eyes gave it a firmer grip on reality. Unfortunately, this movie than does the same think with the final battle with Doomsday. There is just so much stuff getting blown up with massive energy blasts here and there that it is too big to feel real. (It is one of the things that the Avengers/MCU have been getting right that DC needs to improve on, the sense of believability in there city destroying fights.)

Rough around the edges, but a good movie overall. Definitely worth a viewing for Batman if nothing else.",1469664000,,3749,4.4375

However, Ben Affleck did deliver a fine Batman performance and, while the plot did seem a bit convoluted, it was completely entertaining. We probably do not need to see anything further about how Bruce Wayne became Batman, so hopefully that will not be revisited anytime soon. Superman is too much like a caped Jesus Christ and looks as though he will be resurrected in some future installment.  The way Jimmy Olson met his end was entirely outside the original world of Superman.  Probably best not to morph comic book history too much and just try to stay within certain parameters.

This version had a logic that was missing from the other version due to the inclusion of 30 extra minutes making it 3 hrs long. Don't get me wrong, it's still a deeply flawed film in many ways with several missteps, but at least I was able to enjoy it this time. major flaws still include cramming too much story which should have been spread to 2, maybe 3 films. Doomsday should have been the villain of the Justice League film rather than a tacked on 3rd-Act plot device. Batman is still too murdery. I mean, at what point would Alfred have said, ""We're not putting high caliber automatic weapons on all your vehicles, are we?""

7703990,3,B01D64VSYI,"While the film itself is, naturally, graphically stunning, the action powerful and the characters acceptably ""dimensional"", there are certain flaws that are built into the premise that simply can never be overcome, regardless of how the authors try to warp them and make them completely logical and smoothly flowing. And I believe it is those flaws that would forever prevent any incarnation of this particular story from achieving complete success. No matter what they could have done, it's always going to be partially crippled as a story because of its basic nature and will, to some extent, damage the viewer's enjoyment.

First, to state the obvious, the very title locks in the inescapable implication that Batman and Superman are going to have a physical knock-down, drag-out fight. The ""versus"" makes that unavoidable. In a comic book universe it cannot mean that they are going to reasonably debate an issue over coffee, nor can it be some kind of contest with both trying to accomplish some goal independent of them individually (like who would win a foot race, for example.) It can only mean they fight. And not just ""spar"" with one another to see who is better/faster/stronger. It has to be a fight with the clear intention to kill or otherwise destroy each other. The entire first half of the film makes that abundantly clear. This is ""to the death"", and that is what an audience expects.

That alone carries a tremendously damaging flaw that can't ever be overcome. Because both of them are heroes. Both are ""good guys"". While Superman is the ultimate Boy Scout, attempting to do good by adhering to a very strict code of action and behavior, Batman is focused on the accomplishment of a fixed goal by any means necessary, including the random torture and murder of ""innocent"" characters (though they are always bad guys in their own right. They just have nothing to do with the immediate situation other than perhaps as a source of information Batman needs to accomplish his main goal,)

The problem is, the instant you set two ""heroes"" against one another with the clear intent to cause the destruction of the other ""hero"", then one of them automatically stops being a ""hero"". One of them must, of necessity, be less of a hero than the other, which automatically makes them the ""bad guy"" in that specific circumstance. This is inescapable. If Superman is right, then Batman must be, at least partly, wrong. And vice versa. So you wind up with a fight that is already very muddy in terms of its morality. (Remember, they want to kill each other, not just ""teach a lesson"".) One of them is, more or less, attempting to commit murder.

This leads directly to the second major inescapable flaw, and how it was poorly handled in this particular film.

From the outset we see that Superman is directly responsible for the deaths of literally thousands of innocent civilians. That is not only undeniable but it is, in fact, entirely his own fault. Remember, General Zod needs Superman to accomplish his goal in ""Man of Steel"". He requires the latent genetic blueprints of the now lost Kryptonian population which just happens to be mixed in with Superman's bodily genetics. To get it, he has to control or at least obtain Superman. That means that Superman gets to choose where that battle takes place. But instead of heading to some desert somewhere and having it is an empty environment, he chooses it to take place first in the middle of a small town and then, idiotically, in the center of Metropolis! Remember, Zod needs to conquer Superman to accomplish his goal,. Superman does not need to fight Zod at all, so long as he can interrupt the plan to destroy Earth. So from the first frame of this film Superman is already in the wrong. That is more than enough to logically motivate Batman to want to destroy Superman, since he's already, literally, a mass murdered. But you also have to motivate Superman to want to destroy Batman. And how do they try to do that? Superman becomes annoyed that Batman is being unpleasant to a bunch of criminals who he isn't going after at the current time. That's it. And he makes a massive point of disobeying his boss (Perry White) to push this weak and flimsy agenda, whose only purpose is to give him any kind of reason to have the main combat the entire film is based around,

But there is a third flaw that really knocks the entire moral/ethical/logical underpinnings of the whole film off track, and you can pinpoint it to the second.

When Superman's mother is kidnapped by Lex Luthor as leverage to get Superman to fight Batman, Superman flies to confront Batman face to face. Now we already know that until Batman hits him with the Kryptonite gas then there's no contest. Superman is basically a God and Batman can't touch him. So when he first arrives and starts to try and explain his problem, Batman attacks him with a sonic weapon and then machine guns. It's all he can do since Superman is at full strength. But once Superman destroys the machine guns, what does he do? Does he do the logical, intelligent, sensible thing? Does he brush off the shrapnel, turn to Batman and say ""Okay, now that you've gotten that out of your system, can I please explain what I'm here for and enlist your help?"" He doesn't have to worry that Batman will be able to hurt him in the least,. And if Superman really IS the ""good guy"", isn't that what he'd do? Nope. Instead he gets childishly ticked off, stalks over and knocks Batman fifty yards across the parking lot,,, and the fight is on. But that single action makes Superman stupid, petty and nothing like the good guy we expect him to be. He basically becomes a bully.

The final flaw is how the fight ends, when Superman, about to be killed, begs Batman to 'Save Martha"", and that only means anything at all because, conveniently, Batman's mother's name was also Martha. That's it,. That flimsy moment is supposed to instantly calm Batman's rage, not to mention render meaningless his base motivation, wanting to destroy Superman who is, in his eyes, a mass murderer. Huh? That's it? Five minutes later they're best buds, cracking jokes with one another. Does that make any sense?

Of course the film could simply not be allowed to end with the climax consisting only of a school yard punch out, because that would mean there was no point to the fight in the first place (or the movie), so they then have to toss in yet another threat (Doomsday) to give them something massive, spectacular and dazzling to do... together. Happy ending... sort of.

Anyway, it looks like the entire film was specifically designed solely for the purpose of showing Batman and Superman fighting one another, and given the type of characters they are and the two dimensionality of that entire universe, causing that to happen in a way that isn't heavily forced is next to impossible.

But the effects, action and imagery are, admittedly, pretty cool.

So if you just want to see what amounts to a special episode of Ultimate Fighting Championship, then this is the film for you. If you want anything more, forget it,",1469577600,,7097,4.714516129032258

There is no way not to notice that this is an attempt to create an Avenger style tent pole super hero movie with ancillary characters.  That bothered me as minor plot lines seem to fall out of the sky and distract from what I believe is a terrific premise.  How do we protect ourselves from Superman?  How do we insure our survival against a man with God like powers?  The first 3/4 of the movie dive into this exceptionally well with purposeful exposition defending that premise.  However, suddenly for no reason I can discern Wonder Women rolls into town and just starts fighting.  That is when the question that is asked is forgotten in favor of a three way battle with a hulk like CGI pile of mud.  Note as in the first Superman movie Louis Lane has unexplained super powers to appear at will in the completely destroyed Metropolis.

Yes, this movie has editing issues and then there's Batman's drive for murder.  However there's plenty to like about this film.

* Start off by researching the ""Easter Eggs"" that were put into making this film, some thought was put into this.
* Despite my doubts, Ben Affleck does have a potential of being a good Bruce Wayne.
* Superman holds trial for the damage he was partly responsible for.  Makes sense and apparently there was a comic issue.
* You ever heard the debate ""if Batman and Superman were to fight, who would win?""  You hear this quite often.  It was a good fight, no wonder Batman is the key strategist in the Justice League.
* Wonder Woman's fight against Doomsday was great, she has the lust for fighting.  Superman supposedly dies, but you know he doesn't stay dead.
* Lex Luthor finds out about Dark Seid and gives Batman a reason to form Justice League.  Not to mention, there's Bruce's nightmare with the creatures from Dark Seid's lair.  Am highly anticipating Dark Seid, although Brainiac would have also been great.

This film is called Batman versus Superman not Justice League, otherwise they would have called it Justice League so stop bitching about how there was little Wonder Woman or just snip its of the other key Justice League members.  Glad to see Kal Drogo.",1469491200,,1372,4.675

If you want to really experience these characters and enjoy them, stop watching these comic book movies and TV shows that bastardize these characters and go to your local comic book store and buy the comics featuring them.

Zack Snyder got unfairly trashed. If the UE had been released in theaters instead of the theatrical cut we got, we'd discussing a movie that had crossed the billion dollar mark.

Not the strongest plot. I mean, one minute, Batman is about to kill Superman with a kryptonite spear. It just so happens the bad guys have kidnapped Supey's mom (Diane Lane) whose name is Martha, same of Bruce Wayne's mom.

7704109,3,B01D64VSYI,"There have been worse superhero movies, but there have been plenty a lot better. Perhaps the worst of this one is the plot and the woeful Lex Luther.
OK, I get the plot lone of the two hero's misunderstanding each other, the public's expectations of a hero, the medias base lack of conscience and the governments problems with lack of control over these character's and that's spelled out fairly plainly. What I couldn't buy was the coincidence of their mothers names being the same being enough to stop Batman killing his hated enemy and all being forgiven in an instant. (No time to talk and understand each other,remember mums on the clock.)
As for the Lex Luther character, OK, he was supposed to be some sort of crazy criminal mastermind, hence the jumbled, jumpy way of speaking, but he just came across as crazy and most of what he said was incoherent, more delusional than crazy evil mastermind. More Mark Zuckerberg on acid that cold blooded evil genius. If he was attempting to channel Heath Ledger's brilliant Joker, he failed miserably.
So it wasn't trying to copy Marvel's fast action formula with a touch of humour, which is a good thing, neither Batman or Superman lend themselves to that and both leads are rather wooden, so the Robert Downey Jnr. type edge isn't going to fly, but if the makes are going to play it that strait and go for a more complex thoughtful plot, then stick with it. But they dumped it for a big production CGI fight off and a saccharine coated, everyone comes together, happy ending.

7704182,2,B01D64VSYI,"Man, oh man.  Man of Steel was ridiculously bad, and I had high hopes for this to start an improvement, but no.  Way too much stuff going on, and poorly written on top of that.  10 seconds of the Flash, 10 seconds of Aquaman.  What a waste.  When Batman beats Superman, it's because Superman is stupid and overconfident, and I hate stupid and overconfident.  Yet we get lots of both here.  Luthor is the worst incarnation of Luthor we have ever seen.  Clark Kent is not Clark Kent, Perry White is more JJJ, Lois is ???  It's OK to change them from what is the norm, but you have to do some character building to make it matter.

Has the same theme as Civil War, neither carries it off very well.  Yes, superheroes kill people all the time, and there are never any consequences, nor do they ever seem to care very much.

Gal Gadot almost saves it, and she gets a point, so it's a two star not a one star.  If they had played the Bruce Wayne/Diana Prince thing they had going, and then come up with something that tied the three heroes together, not tried to recreate the Death of Superman line, they would have had something.  Should have listened and rented it, not bought it.",1469491200,,1176,4.310502283105023

7704184,5,B01D64VSYI,This movie is a must have for any movie buff. We've seen some very good movies come out in the superhero genre and some really bad ones. This one hits a home run but you have to let your imagination out of the box a bit. I mean that there is a 1930s era feel to some parts of the movie but it's very subtle but it explains some of the shades in the movie. On the other hand there were some scenes where I felt the director figures the audience to be pretty stupid with the on screen announcements. There are better ways to set up scenes imh uneducated opinion. WW was awesome but her theme music gave me chills of corniness but that was the old time throwback in a modern sense that made me want to plug my ears.

7704188,2,B01D64VSYI,"My wife and I don't get the opportunity to go out for many movies or we probably would have gone out and watched this when it hit the big screen. Still, despite the negative reviews, I awaited the release with interest. When I heard there was an extended version which helps clarify and flesh out a bit of the story, I hit the buy button and (based on the review) poured my wife an extra large glass of wine.
Half way into it we paused and discussed. The opinion at that point was: wow, this whole thing is pretty depressing for a super hero movie. It's almost the complete opposite of what Marvel typically puts out (They are usually good for a few laughs, among other things). More in line with The Watchmen, but with a much more confusing story line.
  This is a pretty lengthy movie, all the more so due to the extended cut here. I think it was worth the time to get the extra content, but while the new content made it better, it didn't make it good. We decided to break for the night at the two hour mark and started it up the next day with the hope that it would get a bit more fun/cheerier/clearer towards the end.
  Not really. The good guys started getting their act together, which was an improvement, but we then moved to a rather messing finale. And I don't think I'm giving anything away here (seeing as it was in the preview) saying that it was a pretty big disappointment to find out that one of the ultimate baddies just ended up being a big clone of the big cave troll from Lord of the Rings (visually). I think my jaw actually dropped when I saw that and not in a good way.
  In the end, I didn't really feel that much of anything was really resolved. I felt like Wonder Woman was just thrown in there to revive her character for other movie/TV shows. I kept waiting and waiting for her to do her thing, and when it finally happened, it just wasn't enough to sate the built up anticipation. My wife says she still confused about around 30% of the content of the movie (No, not just because of the wine).
  The special affects were nice, for the most part, but they weren't a huge part of the movie. You won't find yourself going, ""Oooh, ahh, the story's not so great, but it sure is pretty"". Nope, it's too dark for that.
  I've heard other reviews hammering on the characters, and in generally I think people were a little too harsh. I thought the characters were going to be dumber than they were based on the reviews. But in general, there's just not a lot of joy in watching this.",1469491200,,2503,4.261603375527426

8755082,3,B01D64VSYI,"In the public eye, Superman is either seen as a godlike savior for the neighboring cities of Metropolis and Gotham or a reckless oaf who leaves destruction as part of his heroism. The Wayne Enterprises building and the people inside happened to be victims of Supermans carelessness and now Batman wants revenge for the fallen. Stirring the pot between these superheroes is Lex Luthor, a corporate prodigy who comes into possession of Kryptonite (Supermans weakness). Can Batman and Superman get along and team up against the real threat to humanity or will their shades of gray characteristics blind them into fighting each other to the death?

The fact that Zack Snyder uses shades of gray logic to define Batman and Superman is part of what makes this movie unique. Superman can be careless when it comes to containing his powers, but Batman can be just as sadistic and merciless when he brands the bat symbol onto criminals before sending them to jail. These two characters cancel each other out when it comes to the moral high ground, so much so that political pundits such as Charlie Rose and Neil Degrasse Tyson had to be brought in to discuss their risk vs. reward values. Im not saying well have a recklessly devastating superhero scenario in real life, but if we did, are we as a society prepared to make compromises and see the middle ground? We ccouldnt find that middle ground even without Superman and Batman killing everything, so were pretty much doomed. Just look at all the buildings that get destroyed in the name of superhero politics. People give anime a hard time for having buildings burn to the ground so easily, but they need to see this movie for more of the same.

This fictional political climate might have been more jarring to watch if the shooting of the movie was better executed. Something about this movie makes me want to give it a mixed grade despite all it has going for it. It could be the lack of character investment. It could be the slow pacing. It could be the clich violence and destruction. It could be that the pieces of this plot were lazily thrown together. Maybe its the way the movie dragged on for over two hours of nothingness. I cant pinpoint one feature of this movie thats responsible for the negative reviews it got, but when my brother asked me what I thought of it, all I could say was, Meh. The movie had loads of potential to be something great, but something about it just made me want to tune out.

Whatever the main negative point could have been, it certainly wasn't Jesse Eisenbergs acting when it came to his portrayal of Lex Luthor. I know he got a Golden Raspberry award for worst supporting actor, but I disagree with that opinion. Lexs character drew a lot of parallels to Heath Ledgers version of The Joker with how delightfully insane and quirky he was. I have a soft spot for crazy-minded characters due to how relatable they are (not in every way, but in some ways). Sometimes the villains are more relatable than the superheroes. In fact, they can be just as shades of gray as Batman and Superman are in this movie. I keep wondering what it was that made Lex Luthor snap the way he did. We don't get a clear answer by the end, so that makes me even more curious. Either way, I love his kooky portrayal! The body language, the tics, the cadence in his voice, even Lexs hairstyle reminds me of The Joker. Golden Raspberry, my foot!

While Batman vs. Superman isn't a perfect movie, Im not going to completely dump all over it despite its glaring flaws. A mixed grade is nothing to sneeze at, especially considering everybody else seems to be headhunting these days when reviewing suspicious movies. I wanted to enjoy this movie. I love the DC Universe. I stuck with the film until the end. Again, its not perfect, but the haters can calm down just for a little while before they click that one or two-star option.",1537747200,,3884,4.5922190201729105

8755084,1,B01D64VSYI,The story line was not coherent and extremely boring. The movie could not end soon enough as it dragged on and on and on and on and on...

8755086,4,B01D64VSYI,"I'll confirm what most people have said, the extended version is quite a bit better. There's more explanation for why certain things are happening, something the theatrical cut didn't do a great job with. This is by no means ""The Dark Knight"" but I genuinely enjoyed watching it, and have done so more than once. The Nolan movies are among my favorite of all time, but I really like Afflecks version of Batman. This pulls a lot from The Dark Knight Returns, which is a good thing. This is an older, more brutal Batman.

There are still problems, certainly. But I think it's a fun movie to watch. The warehouse scene is worth it by itself.",1537574400,,638,4.5
