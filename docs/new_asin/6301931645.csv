378669,5,6301931645,"This is a truly magnificent series and a definite MUST for anyone interested remotely in Silent Film. As an historic record of interviews with what were really the last of the Silent Stars, this series is quite unique. The beautifully restored film excerpts are a joy to see, and the glorious scoring by Carl Davis does them more than justice. I just wish someone with the power to do so would read this and release the whole series on DVD - I for one would snap it up! A big ""thankyou"" to Kevin Brownlow, David Gill and Carl Davis for this brilliant treasure chest of Silent gems.",1025568000,8,581,4.4392523364485985
378670,5,6301931645,For the lover of silent film...look no further.  This documentary was truly a labor of love for the film makers. Every silent film great and not so great had been given an opportunity to give their point of view of how it was during the silent film era.  How smart of the producers to decide to film the recollections of these silent film veterans. It's been twenty years since it was filmed and most if not all of the witnesses of the silent film era have passed away!  For the true film historian this is one doucmentary series that you cannot pass up. Enjoy!,986256000,7,561,4.375
378671,5,6301931645,"One of the finest documentaries on film period.  I taped it off the air when broadcast, replaced those with the videos when they came out, then followed the videos with the laserdiscs.  A complete labor of love and stunning in every aspect.  If it came out on DVD, I would probably buy it again.  By the way, if you had taped it off the air, each tape includes material that was cut for the television broadcasts.",983491200,21,413,4.394736842105263
378672,4,6301931645,"This British TV series on silent movies is somewhat hampered by the incidental music by Carl Davis, which can work against the strengths of the titles presented. If only Davis had applied as much sensitivity to the bombast as he does in the touching waltz he provies for the credit sequence.  The directing styles of Cecil B DeMille and Erich von Stroheim are presented here as being similar. We even get staged footage of both of them having tantrums, though von Stroheim's is the one more likely to make an impact. This study of the 2 directors who worked in the silent era aims to equate DeMille's undervalued artistry with von Stroheim's legendary one. Perhaps it's easier to be considered a genuis when you are self-destructive, like Orson Welles, than if you are more able to work with the constraints the studios imposed on you. However does compromise lessen an artists legitimacy? Like von Stroheim, DeMille began as an actor but was overshadowed by his more successful actor father and playwright brother, and though we are told his initial titles like The Cheat represent his purist film-making he soon capitulated into making titles for the mass market - his Gloria Swanson vehicles of clothes, the kitschy set design of Forbidden Fruit, and then his religious sermons - concessions to the Hays Censorship Office with retribution for sexual extravagance. These titles aren't without charm - witness the Cinderella scene from Fruit -  and his Ten Commadments is full of sensual camp, if not any sense of humour. DeMille may have been as successful as Chaplin and Pickford and a perfectionist in his own terms, but his legacy remains generic, and his sound films a shadow of his earlier glory. The Cheat features a sadistic branding of a woman, ironically punished for NOT submitting herself to a man, yet it links DeMille with von Stroheim's interest in fetishism. Von Stroheim acted as a Prussian officer in a film for DW Griffith and kept the uniform and pose for the rest of his career. It is said that he too had an insecurity complex, but it manifested itself in being self-destructive, creating works of great skill and beauty but deliberately making them unprofitable. von Stroheim's extravagance was his quest for detail - his recreation of Monte Carlo for Foolish Wives was epic - and it was this same obsessive behaviour that led to him being removed from what are thought to be his masterpieces, Greed and Queen Kelly. The footage from them here shows his clarity of vision. De Mille is thought to have been a master of crowd scenes but von Stroheim is more interesed in the subtlety of the individual and of the moment. De Mille was a preacher and von Stroheim simply unbalanced. It is ironic that Swanson should leave De Mille after he made her a star, yet she would destroy von Stroheim, by effectively firing him from the film (Queen Kelly) which she had specifically wanted him for. It is not surprising that he looks at her with such contempt in Sunset Boulevard, though she gets points for showing the never-released Queen Kelly in the scene where Norma Desmond watches her own film. That von Stroheim's work has become a curiosity is also indicative of the changing attiitude towards the independent director in Hollywood with the transition from silents to talkies and the reign of the moguls and their studio factories.",980726400,5,3351,4.846422338568935
378673,5,6301931645,"This is probably the finest documentary about early Hollywood ever produced. Made with love and care by veteran film historians Brownlow & Gill, it is a fascinating look at the beginnings of film, from the earliest days of the flickers to the advent of the talkies.  Along the way, we get a full history of Hollywood--its directors, stars, and scandals.  Each episode is more interesting than the next and completely holds your attention from beginning to end.  From comedy to the silent movies stuntman, from egotistical directors to glamorous stars, this has it all.  I have seen it many times and own it myself and if you are a lover of silent film, it is a must.  Wonderful original music by Carl Davis and excellent narration by the late James Mason.

378674,4,6301931645,"""Swanson and Valentino"" is the 6th of the 13-part documentary series ""Hollywood: A celebration of the American silent film."" Producers/writers Kevin Brownlow and David Gill always turned up  interesting anecdotes about and insights into their subjects. This episode  examines the careers of two of the biggest stars of the silents, Gloria  Swanson and Rudolph Valentino. Swanson started out in Mack Sennett  comedies, for which she was ill-suited as she didn't understand the jokes  and hated slapstick. It took Cecil B. DeMille's touch and her own hard work  and determination to make her one of the cinema's legends. Ironically, she  is better remembered today for her portrayal of Norma Desmond in  ""Sunset Boulevard,"" as a silent star turned mad recluse, than for  her actual silent roles. Valentino's story is also poignant. Although he  had definite star wattage, his studio managers often misused his talent. He  was one of the first actors to strike out on his own after fighting the  studio system and winning his freedom. Unfortunately, his disastrous  marriage and divorce brought about his downfall. He was on the verge of a  comeback when he fell ill (and his stardom directly contributed to his  early demise, but you'll have to watch this to see why). As always,  Brownlow and Gill present fascinating interviews, this time with Swanson  herself and film folk who worked with or covered her and Valentino. This  isn't the best episode in the series, but it's still very good. I recommend  it. As a whole, this is still the best series ever done on American silent  films.",961977600,12,1586,5.026923076923077

Do you want to know how Hollywood became what it is today???  You have to see this series.  The problem: Finding it!!!  Unless you one of the lucky few to own the VHS series, dream on.  This series is so dead on true, no holds barred, in telling Hollywood's story that it may be held back because nothing is held back.  There are brief flashes of nudity and vulgarity that is all too necessary in telling the truth about Hollywood.  I don't know who owns the rights to this series, but I wish they would release it on DVD!!!  The time has come to do so.  I think the public can handle the vulgarity and so forth.  In fact, I think the innuendos in it would be considered tame today.  My favorite episode???  Hollywood III: Single Beds And Double Standards; the story of Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle.  If they ever filmed this episode or made a film about Arbuckle's life, it would be one of the greatest exposs about Hollywood ever!!!",1404000000,,1055,4.455497382198953
378718,5,6301931645,"This is Episode 3 of a 13 volume set which examines the early history of America's motion picture industry: from its inception in New York through Hollywood's silent era.  This episode focuses on the events leading to the creation and implementation of the Hays Code for the production of motion pictures.  Featured are the events leading to the death of starlet Virginia Rappe and the resulting trial of Fatty Arbuckle for her murder, Arbuckle's ruination, and the resulting impact on his career and Hollywood's motion picture industry itself.

In this episode, it can be seen that Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle was one of the two top comedians in Hollywood during its early years, the other being Charlie Chaplin.  Then, in September 1921, Arbuckle attended a wild Hollywood party in San Francisco during which Virginia Rappe died mysteriously.  Arbuckle, primarily because of his weight, was accused of murdering her during an attempted rape during which his extreme weight caused her bladder to rupture.  Railroaded by an overzealous district attorney, he was tried (as I recall) three times; the first two resulting in hung juries, before finally being acquitted.  But the damage was done.  Arbuckle had been villainized in the public mind to such an extent that his career was over.  Theaters refused to show his films, and his contract was cancelled.  At the same time, Hollywood had been dragged through the mud and something had to be done to save the industry.  The result was the extreme Hays Code of censorship which prevailed for the next forty years.
.
After watching this episode, one can't help but feel sorry for the hapless Arbuckle, who was clearly a victim of circumstances and an unscrupulous district attorney.  But looking back on it now --- considering the current sorry state of motion picture violence, ethics and values --- one must also long for the days of the Hays Code, when America was the admiration of the world.  Perhaps Arbuckle's career didn't die in vain.  In any case: this is a great episode, which should be of interest to anyone interested in the history of the motion picture industry.  And it is greatly enhanced by the marvelous voice of its narrator, James Mason.",1378252800,3,2203,4.96457765667575

378723,5,6301931645,"This is a superb -- nay, definitive! -- series.  (The currently running TCM series on Hollywood is nice, but it can't hold a candle to this one.)  For years, I owned it on VHS but about two years ago, I decided I really wanted it on DVD.  Some determined web research turned up a website that converts videotapes to DVDs for an extremely reasonable price (far from the extortionate rates everyone else seemed to require).  Check out Nettapes.  I think they're in Canada.  You send them your tapes and in a very reasonable time, they send them back to you along with the DVDs to which they've converted them.  The DVDs seem to be good quality, too.  (Of course, you need to own the videotape version in the first place so you can send it to them ....)

I hope Amazon, et al, are listening here because even though I DO have this wonderful series on DVD now, I would LOVE to buy a professionally produced version, since I expect that would avoid any loss of resolution involved in the conversion process.  Wikipedia says that the originally planned conversion foundered on assorted legal problems because there were so many parties involved in the matter.  I share another reviewer's question as to why that didn't seem to interfere with the original videotape release ... but then, lawyers are lawyers, I guess.",1290470400,3,1310,4.6521739130434785

It can never be equaled, because the silent filmmakers who were interviewed for it are now gone. The score by Carl Davis, particularly the title music, is also superb.

The series was also released on laserdisc, at a price of about $250, so it is likely that few laserdisc copies currently exist. It is ironic that a series about the lost art of silent film may now too be irretrievably lost except for a few copies on obsolete formats such as VHS and laserdisc.

The series should, of course, be released on DVD and Blu-ray, but may never be because, as someone once told Buster Keaton, the parade's gone by.",1280620800,2,795,4.5524475524475525

378769,5,6301931645,"I am very glad I got this collection, new, when I did!

This set of mini-documentaries and interviews are a treasure that is woefully overlooked in the growing interest in silent film groups.

Oh - to have it in DVD!

The silent star recounting their excitement and memories are infectious.  This is a classic work - very well done - and but for the intro music and some graphics, holds it's age .

As many silent film collections that have come forward in the last few years - some very obscure - this set would have more mass-appeal - and including the later classic actors' views on the silents would be interesting to Classic Movie Fans as well.

That it includes very major silent film stars interviewed in-depth is remarkable and one can see and feel time roll back - and the actor/actress reborn.  Some of my favorites are Viola Dana recollecting the death of her fiance in an aerial stunt for the movies.  The other is (I believe - I'm writing this from memory) Hal Roach's ribauld memories and also King Vidor's observations.

It's like sitting on the backlot of an old movie studio - and hearing the gossip retold of the teens and twenties!

This set caught my interest in silent film when I was in my teens viewing it in the early 1980's.  It never let-go.

Does anyone know who can be written to request the DVD version be produced?

Not only was it an excellent documentary, it gave many viewers their first and, probably, last look at stars from the silent era; most of whom would be dead within the next 5 years. Also since saving film wasn't much a concern back then, many of the clips used have probably deteriorated to dust. My only complaint is that this excellent 11+ hours series isn't released on DVD in America, as yet, and I still have to lug out 13 individual VHS tapes to watch it instead of 2 or 3 DVDs in a compact case.",1182902400,6,565,4.192660550458716

Absolutely riveting in its wonderful arcana, in-person interviews, stock photos and footage, narration by James Mason, and the terrific music by the brilliant Carl Davis, this series is a must-see for anyone who loves film and wants to know where it all started!! There are facts and anecdotes here to amaze, and break the heart as well. Mason's voice-overs are perfect....one minute he's the objective narrator, and the next moment, his inflection can have you chuckling, or tearing up at the stories of all the various players in the early days of Hollywood. And has there ever been a more beautiful score for television, or film for that matter, than the work of Carl Davis?? His opening title alone for the credits is gorgeous, and the producers then use different pieces that Davis has composed for these silent films. If only his music had been available to the original producers and directors for them to hear. Obviously, Davis must be one of the biggest fans of silent film of all time. If you can get a copy of this series, do so. It is never shown on television anymore, and it's a terrible thought that this series could be lost through neglect the way so much of the film from the 20's and 30's has been lost. It has been estimated that more than half of all silent film has disintegrated or been disposed of.

There are 13 tapes in the series narrated by James Mason; each examines a different bit of film history. There is a tape for comedy, a tape for westerns, a tape for war movies, a tape for cameramen, a tape for directors, a tape for the stars, a tape for the scandals, a tape for the end of it all, pretty much a tape for everything. Each one is carefully researched and lovingly compiled by wonderful historians Kevin Brownlow and David Gill to truly accentuate the importance and specialness of the silent film era.

The different types of comic falls are identified, mogul Mack Sennett is discussed, Max Linder is briefly mentioned, and the big four, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Harry Langdon, are explained in detail.

Clips from films such as The Pawnshop, The Rink, The Kid, Hot Water, Safety Last, Steamboat Bill Jr., The General, and The Strong Man are utilized.

This documentary features interviews with Hal Roach, Frank Capra, Harvey Parry, Marion Mack, George Harris, William Hornbeck, and Jackie Coogan.",1139616000,,870,5.251798561151079
378831,5,6301931645,"The seventh part of the great Hollywood documentary series focuses on the two major directors of the silent era: Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim. The two were very different in the method of work; DeMille worked with the studios to make epic films and Stroheim worked against them.

There are clips from some of DeMilles films including The Ten Commandments, The Cheat, Male and Female, Why Change Your Wife?, Forbidden Fruit, Manslaughter, and The King of Kings. Von Stroheim is represented by films like The Wedding March, Heart of Humanity, Blind Husbands, Foolish Wives, Greed, Merry-Go-Round, and Queen Kelly.

Many of the biggest names of the silent era are interviewed here such as Paul Kohner, A. Arnold Gillespe, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Henry Hathaway, Agnes DeMille, Henry King, Gloria Swanson, Leatrice Joy, Anita Loos, Paul Ivano, Al Rogell, Valerie von Stroheim, Grant Wytock, and Byron Haskin.",1139616000,2,915,5.175675675675675

DeMille were some of the most popular of the era and she created fashions all over the world with the outrageous and glamorous clothing she wore in them. Rudolph Valentino made woman swoon in the aisles of the movie houses with his Italian looks and his blatant sexuality. These two stars are the focus of the 6th installment of the brilliant Hollywood documentary series.

There are interviews here with the lovely Gloria Swanson, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Alberto Valentino, Viola Dana, Paul Ivano, Agnes DeMille, Ben Lyon, and Lois Wilson.

Clips from Male and Female, Queen Kelly, Sadie Thompson, Sunset Boulevard, The Shiek, Eyes of Youth, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Monsieur Beaucaire, The Eagle, and Son of the Shiek adorn the film.",1139616000,3,829,5.0

Many of them are exclusive to this set and they are plentiful due to the fact that all of the stunts were done by someone in the silent days. We also learn how some of the more complex stunts were filmed.

There are interviews with stunt men, actors and actresses, and directors. Harvey Parry, Agnes DeMille, Byron Haskin, Al Rogell, Yakima Canut, Paul Malvern, Mrs. Buck Jones, Allan Dwan, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Harold Lloyd, Colleen Moore, Leatrice Joy, Viola Dana, and Bob Rose provide details on the era.

Some of the most touching stories come from actress Viola Dana and stuntman Harvey Parry. Parry says, ""It was just a different day... I wish I could really explain... the greatness of the old days."" This collection does a great job at explaining.

There are also countless clips of amazing stunts. Play Safe, Thundering Hoofs, Devil Horse, The Beloved Rogue, The Black Pirate, Safety Last, Wings, Lilac Time, and The Trail of '98.",1139616000,3,1120,4.915343915343915
378874,5,6301931645,"The fourth part of the Hollywood series made by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill and narrated by James Mason examines the art of the war film, how it began and how its popularity surged even during peacetime. First, we learn about films power during WWI, propaganda films, the use of stars to sell war bonds, and Erich von Stroheim's role as the hated hun. Then, we see how The Big Parade helped to revive the war film in 1925, bringing about many excellent followers.

Clips range from anti-war films like The Battle Cry of Peace, Civilization, and Intolerance to the use of newsreels, propaganda films like The Bond and Hearts of the World, and My Four Years in Germany to the renewed popularity due to films like The Big Parade, What Price Glory?, Wings, and All Quiet on the Western Front.

Many Hollywood moguls are interviewed as well including Anita Loos, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Jesse L. Lasky Jr., Agnes DeMille, Lillian Gish, Valerie von Stroheim, Blanche Sweet, King Vidor, Raoul Walsh, William Wellman, Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers, and Lewis Milestone.",1139616000,,1055,4.888268156424581

As always, some of the biggest celebrities of the silent era are interviewed. Adela Rogers St. Johns, Viola Dana, Ben Lyon, Anita Loos, Colleen Moore, Karl Brown, King Vidor, Sam Marx, Gloria Swanson, Henry Hathaway, Byron Haskin, Cedric Belfrage, Al Rogell, and Henry King offer insight and tell stories about the Hollywood they helped to create.

This particular tape opens the series rather well. It shows bits of the film that ended the silent era, The Jazz Singer, and explains why it was such a tragic release. Common stereotypes about silent films are identified and disproven. Several veterans of the silent era are interviewed.

The wonderful thing about this tape is that both newcomers and veteran silent film viewers can enjoy it. It can also be watched over and over again; it never seems to get old. Kevin Brownlow and David Gill certainly did a service to this lost art.",1137542400,,713,4.884297520661157
378878,5,6301931645,"To answer a question frequently raised concerning Hollywood, ""Why isn't it available on DVD yet?"" there are legal issues involved. Thames Television is well aware that there are tens of thousands of film fans champing at the bit to buy a complete DVD set of Hollywood. However, until the legal problems are settled, we will have to make do with the VHS version, which is broadcast from time to time by Turner Classic Movies.

Brownlow and Gill made their massive documentary at exactly the right time. Many of the people who created the silent film medium were gone, but some were still around, expecially those who had worked behind the cameras; and they were happy to tell the stories that otherwise might have died with them. (My personal favorites are stuntman Paul Malvern telling the story of how they made the catapult shot over the roofs of Paris for Barrymore's Beloved Rogue; and Gloria Swanson's reminiscence of her war-hero father coming onto the set after returning from  World War I and discovering his daughter in a lion pit with a supposedly 'nice' lion roaring on her back and Cecil B. DeMille standing by with a loaded pistol... just in case.)

Brownlow and Gill take the history of the movie industry from its infancy in Fort Lee, New Jersey to the advent of sound that destroyed its earlier incarnation as high pantomime instantly understandable around the world with the splicing in of new title cards. Along the way they discuss the star system, how serious a business comedy was, how the silent directors got the high-risk shots in realtime without the use of back projection or bluescreen, how certain special effects that were trade secrets for many years were done, directors who worked within the Hollywood system and those who bucked it, censorship, how the movies went from 'the flickers' to high art, and much, much more. The series is so rich, it requires repeated viewing to fully appreciate it and the labor of love it so obviously is.

Perhaps the highest tribute that can be paid to Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film is this. After the teaser of each episode, the same title track appears of actors and actresses performing. Some of the shots are montages, others are clips from the movies. Take someone who knows absolutely nothing about the silents and show him the series.

I will guarantee that by the time the last episode is reached, that person who started out knowing nothing about the silent cinema will be able to name every actor and actress that appears on the screen, every movie from which a clip is taken, and every actor and every set from which movies that are used in the montages. THAT is how far Browlow and Gill pull their viewers into that long-lost universe of four generations ago. Very few can bring a dead era to life again. This series does so, and does so brilliantly.  It is a must-have for the collection of every serious student of film - and anybody who simply likes the movies as well.",1137369600,8,2972,4.727799227799228
378879,5,6301931645,"David Gill and Kevin Brownlow have made more than a documentary with this great series: they have captured the energy and excitement of America in the first two decades of the 20th century. See this volume, then the whole series, if you want to know just why Hollywood captured the imagination of America, and then the world.

No mere series of talking heads here. You will see the great names of early cinema giving their viewpoints on the cultural phenomenon of which they were a part, and which was shortly to change the world, along with excerpts of significant films, projected at their correct speed (a real revelation if you think silent film is jerky or 'speeded up').

The series is probably the most valuable cultural heritage of cinema in existance. Who is looking after this archive to preserve it for future generations?  Is HBO an archival institution? Is the AFI interested? One hopes it is not just mouldering away on tape. It needs digital transfer, and release on DVD, urgently.

Brownlow's TCM originals are quite good: ""Cinema Europe"", ""Universal Horror"", etc. However, none of them quite equal this. Why it has not been released on DVD, yet, is just plain odd.

Many years ago, I was lucky enough to obtain a LaserDisc (12-inch disc) copy of the series, which was rare and hard to find even when it was in print. I'm very glad now that I made the effort to track down what may well have been the last retail copy to be had anywhere. [March 2005]

It was a last chance to do a serious retrospective documentary on silent films and interview many of the big stars from the 1920's and earlier.

The videos in this series are highly watchable and entertaining.  Each has a theme and provides interviews and clips to go into more detail.

If you are into silent films then you should try out this series.  Sadly it is hard to get access to since it is only in print in tiny spurts.  Libraries, which already have silent film collections, should make this series available.  It has so many interviews and information that connects between different silent films that someone will want to watch these.

For the first time,we get to see classic silent films run at their correct speed and with the appropiate music. This reveals silent movies as more like visual poems with the viewer caught up in the music and picture.

Silent fims were not silent as some theatres had orchestras of up to 100 musicians,and what a difference they made.

Some silent films had special effects as good as modern day films and one Douglas Fairbanks(snr)film made in 1926 was actually made in an early form of color.

The ""Hollywood"" series tells us about the industry and it's dangers with extras sometimes killed while making films. It reveals the forgotten stars of the time and what befell them.

It's a labour of love made by people who clearly adore silent cinema and their admiration for this singular artform, as for the many artists--from directors, writers and cameramen to actors and stuntmen--who created it, is practically palpable in every scene. Like many others, this series functioned for me as an eye-opening introduction to the astonishing world of silent Hollywood when I first saw it as a boy on television, so I owe it a great deal! To this day, I can't hear the lush strains of Carl Davis's magnificent theme music without getting goosebumps.

I would have to say this is the definitive history of early Hollywood and film making in general, essential viewing to anyone interested in film and its history, but the amazing thing is this documentary is so well written with such great love and attention to detail that it can easily engross the casual viewer. It is simply compelling stuff.
The greatest thing is this documentary was made in the late 1970's, just as all the amazing stars and behind the scene people were slowly fading away, leaving only their shadow captured in nitrate. They now may be gone, but their spirit lives on through this series.
I feel a secret envy when I listen to the silent stars and crew enthusiastically speaking about what life was like back then, it really was new territory they were treading. The film footage used in the series is great and there are many excerpts of lost/rare films. It's a shame that people think silent cinema is all high speed flickering car chases and cream pies in the face... this series shows how it developed from a primitive side show entertainment to a fully fledged art form capable of crossing cultures all over the world. We think we know about fame today... these early stars were WORLD famous in every sense, thanks to the fact the films they appeared in depended so much more on the actual image and less on the words. Title cards were easily translated.
I think there is one interview that captures it all... during the end of the ""Stuntmen"" episode, the old stuntman who was interviewed, verging on tears, looks to the interviewer and points to his heart, and says ""I wish I could get what is in here, out...."" It was if he was saying the times were so magical, that it is impossible to describe how amazing they were.

Besides a wealth of film material, creators Kevin Brownlow and David Gill managed to
interview many survivors of silent era Hollywood, right back to the industry's infancy.

As an example, participants in Chapter One (THE PIONEERS) include directors King Vidor, Karl Brown
and Byron Haskin, producer/directors D.W. Griffith (archive interview) and Hal Roach, writers Anita Loos
and Adela Rogers St. Johns, also actors Jackie Coogan, Lillian Gish, Dolores Costello, Blanche Sweet and
Viola Dana, whose film career began on the East Coast in 1910.

Individual episodes cover a wide range of topics: WWI films, Hoillywood scandals, famous directors,
visual marvels achieved by cameramen, amazing stunt work, comedy, westerns, two acting superstars,
and finally the coming of sound and an almost immediate demise of a remarkable art form, silent pictures.

The first episode opens with a demonstration of the power of silent film: a thrill rooftop fire rescue, the
emotional impact of which is heightened by a matching orchestral score. The very last thing we see in
Chapter 13 (END OF AN ERA) is mortally wounded musketeer John Barrymore joining his ghostly friends
in the sky. The thirteen hours in-between are packed with fascinating details, reminiscences, and always,
compelling silent footage, the best of the small percentage that's survived the passage of many decades.
