After a little research I found she has a permanent spinal injury ;( glad to see she can still perform. God bless her for all the enjoyment she's given the world.",1498953600,,254,4.644444444444445
8701374,4,B00TEJ9YT6,"The first DVD Amazon sent me would not play.  I suspect they are buring them on demand and the recording side of the DVD was filthy.  The second one I got plays fine, but it was a hassel.

I wasn't sure if this was recorded before she became so overtaken with the arthritis that was inflicted on her from a chirpopractor.  I had heard she was in bad shape.  I sysmphathize with her because a chirporactor ruined the top three vertebrae in my neck and I know have severe arthritis in them and have had to have surgery once so I can turn my head.  But, this was recorded will after she became nearly incapacited with the problem.

The deep sultry vocals are gone, but she is still her sultry self.

THe DVD quailty is excellent and so is the sound.  If you are a ""lover of her"", you will want to own this.

I am and always will be a die hard fun of Alannah, the 85bpm CD is great, just not sure when it was recorded.  But i hate to say it, but unless you are just a true die hard fun it is hard to watch her on this DVD.  I wish there were DVD's of her much younger days in concert.",1459987200,2,1080,3.972093023255814
8701375,5,B00TEJ9YT6,"Beautiful performance, beautifully filmed--Alannah truly soars and inspires in this intimate live commemoration.

Amazing band, great setlist and mixed to perfection, this emotional concert is a must-have for any Alannah Myles fan... or any music fan, for that matter!

With a handful of timeless rockers and a delicate bluesy ""unplugged"" feel throughout, Alannah pours out her heart and soul in this extraordinary official live DVD celebrating her 25th anniversary.",1438819200,5,466,5.739130434782608
8701376,5,B00TEJ9YT6,"This is a little understated jewel in the crown of Alannahs musical career. Both sound and picture quality are amazing and the track listing is dotted with hidden gems as well as better known hits.
Alannah delivers in a somewhat more sedate style here , which might come as a shock to those of us who remember her scorching her way across a stage and climbing up lighting rigs, whilst having the (male contingent in the audience) eating out of the palm of her hand, but shows she's still more than capable of delivering the goods.
You may or may not be aware of the degree of financial battle over royalties that Alannah has been dealing with, purchasing this will help put the pennies back in the pocket of one whose earned it, that for me was reason enough..........",1426982400,8,768,4.532374100719425
