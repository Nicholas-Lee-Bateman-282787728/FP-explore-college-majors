We tried regular videos but their attention is not quite there yet.  They liked seeing the words, with my preschooler trying to spell the letters and also repeating the Chinese and Spanish word.  Then they had fun with the poses (from a cartoon).  I didn't know what to expect from it, but during the pose the narrator asks questions like - What kind of Table are you?  (in table pose).  My pre-schooler was very engaged, thinking and answering the posed (pun intended) questions while holding the pose.  I also found the length of this video (around 15 minutes) was perfect for a 2 and 4 yr old's attention span.

Our favorite pose - ""Television""  (it's not really a pose, they say grab a remote and point it at the TV!).  My older child actually caught on and found the humor in the some of the random words and poses like TV mixed in.

This is not really yoga by any means, but a lot of fun and a good way to start a child's interest.",1410652800,2,1085,4.38

8374379,1,B002MZZTHK,"It is the worst yoga video I have ever seen. I watched 15 minutes of it, there was no girl doing the poses, only an ugly drawing of a girl with horrible animations on how the kid should move. My daughter (3) watched it for less than 2 minutes and asked me to turn it off. There is nothing fun in watching it and it absolutely doesn't encourage children to do any yoga at all. I have practiced yoga for over 10 years and believe me, there is absolutely no accuracy in the poses shown in this dvd. Don't buy it!!!",1277856000,,511,4.069306930693069
8374380,5,B002MZZTHK,"I'm a former teacher who is now a SAHM.  My daughter Mandy is high energy and needs more vocabulary words.  At her 2 year check up, her pediatrician recommended an exercise program like yoga to calm her down.  When I looked for a yoga tape for toddlers, this video series was the one I found.  Mandy was immediately interested because of the little girl on the cover.  The animation and poses were so fun Mandy was performing right along. She even said the words out loud. Although not my kind of adult exercise video, Brainy Yogis was perfect for young children. It did engage Mandy and I plan on getting the other videos in this set.",1253318400,6,635,4.439655172413793
