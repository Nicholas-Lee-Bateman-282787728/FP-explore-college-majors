4539371,5,B0053O8ACS,"Although not as laugh-out-loud crazy as other episodes, this one does have an entertaining story with a nice message at the end about what it means to be ""from"" somewhere. As all other Leslie centered episodes this is a must watch.",1329782400,,231,4.658536585365853
4539372,4,B0053O8ACS,"As Valentine's Day approaches, Leslie's Galentine's Day comes back to the show. At Galentine's Day brunch, Leslie realizes that Ann hasn't been dating after breaking up with Chris. In response, Leslie turns all her attention to setting Ann up with a date.

The city's Valentine's dance turns into an attempt to find Ann a new boyfriend. But in a surprise twist, you'll be surprised to see who she leaves with.

A fun sideplot has Ben, Ron, and Andy solving a series of riddles left by Leslie. Will they crack the clues in time and find Leslie's surprise?

Another strong episode. If you've enjoyed the rest of Season Four, you'll like this episode.",1328659200,,648,4.767857142857143
4539373,5,B0053O8ACS,"I can write a whole paragragh or even a peper on how much i love this show but i am going to simply sum it down to, Best show on tv. plain and simple.",1327536000,11,150,3.4411764705882355
4539374,4,B0053O8ACS,"Leslie's recent suspension from work forces her into relaxation for less than a day. At that point, Leslie can't take it anymore and decides to form a citizen action committee. Her new team, the Parks Committee of Pawnee (or PCP), starts to agitate and petition the government for park improvement.

Another fun side story in this episode is the Christmas gift-giving within the Parks Department. As always, Leslie picks out wonderful, thoughtful gifts for everyone, so Ron tasks the entire office with thinking up the perfect gift for Leslie.

Finally, poll results come back showing that Leslie's support for city council has fallen from 26% to 1%. The end of the show tracks Leslie's struggle with whether to drop out of the race or keep fighting.",1323388800,,750,4.944444444444445
4539375,5,B0053O8ACS,"I only got into Parks and Recreation over the summer, but I devoured three seasons worth of episodes on 10 days.  That's how awesome this show is.  Of course when I saw this preview up on Amazon for download, I clicked and watched.  My excitement level went from ""So excited!"" to ""Oh my God I need to go celebrate this awesomeness at the Snakehole Lounge like right now.""

If you haven't watched Parks and Recreation yet, you should really rethink your choices in life because by not watching this show you're probably depriving your funny bone of one of the best medicines it could ever have.  And once you're done with season 3, watch this and prepare yourself for season 4.  Trust me, I wouldn't lead you astray.  If I wanted to do that, I'd tell you to watch Two and a Half Men and cringe through it.

Parks and Recreation is one of the funniest shows on television, hands down, and this preview does not disappoint.",1315008000,7,920,4.467065868263473
4539376,5,B0053O8ACS,From just saw in this sneak peak. All three of the tammy explains so much about ron. Ever since i have heard about all three tammys in episode 4 of season 2. My first thought was that is going to be an amazing episode. Also leslie drunk off one shot of moonshine that will be just a joy to watch. I am really excited about crazy Entertainment 7/20 will be as well. Oh and to scent. I cannot wait to here the descriptions of what it smells like. Thank you amazon. I cannot wait for season 4.

4539460,5,B0053O8ACS,"This season builds on the previous seasons and is the best so far.  Leslie's run for City Council is a fantastic story line with great parodies of elections in general.  Paul Rudd as the clueless but charmingly hilarious Bobby Newport is a fantastic addition to the cast, and Kathryn Hahn as his campaign manager is totally on point.  It's a total whirlwind of comedy, emotions, satire, and moments that make you fall in love with these characters even more.",1474156800,,458,4.772151898734177

Mostly focused in these television shows on disrupting each other rather than the extended version in the real world of imposing object rape con dumbs on the former places of worship of hetero religion.

8455490,3,B0053O8ACS,"Continues to be a very entertaining series, but often the Office parallels can be a little too strong (namely in the character of Ben Wyatt, who has basically become the Jim character of the show, the straight guy who looks at the camera for certain gags. Sure, it's funny, but you can't help but pick up that strong Office vibe.) The writing remains strong and you do get to know the characters a little bit better, but it gets tiring always seeing Jerry as the butt of all jokes, and April being constantly annoying. It get it, that they want to keep dragging these particular gags out, but it does get old (particularly April's bratty attitude about everything.)
A very uplifting season finale to this season, and I'm anxious to see where the series goes from here.",1501804800,,768,4.613138686131387
8455491,5,B0053O8ACS,"I started watching this show because friends told me about the series, and now it's on my ""watch before I die"" list.  I would recommend Parks & Rec to anyone who appreciates lighthearted, modestly irreverent- and often awkward- humor delivered by lovable, relatable characters (April and Ron are my personal favorites!).

You will want to start at season 1 and work your way through to the series finale.  So, season 4 is an essential plot bridge.  The plot thickens in season 4 as the campaign story develops and romantic relationships wax and wane.  Now that each character is fully developed, it's brought the hardest laughs yet.",1485820800,,632,4.9245283018867925
