6682332,3,B00NW6KO64,"The movie was good but the title
Is deceiving with shark coming and attack  the girls on the cover. This is not what I expected to be in mansion house with the main character portraying the shark herself and not like cover with waves crashing shark attack attacking the innocents on the beach and creating a cast atrophy in Beverly Hills. This is not great movie and all the other previews in this movie is that they used the same mansion for other titles they've filmed already. In future when you advertise this sort of titles why not make it like the cover and with all background disaster otherwise don't do it at all this is very deceiving from you movie makers. I enjoy My shark movies but not this one.",1425600000,2,709,4.412213740458015
6682333,1,B00NW6KO64,Advertisement was great and artistically creative but the movie was a total let down compared to any other shark movies. I expected an ocean movie not a teen murder mystery to sum it all up.,1424563200,5,190,4.457142857142857

8680692,3,B00NW6KO64,"Well, it is definitely an interesting take on the killer shark genre. Kind of stupid but had enough silliness to be somewhat fun and enjoyable. Don't get your hopes up though because it is a dumb movie. Watch at your own risk!",1442620800,,226,4.404761904761905
8680693,1,B00NW6KO64,"I have a conundrum. I just watched ""Raiders of the Lost Shark"" back to back with ""90210 Shark Attack"". When I saw it I thought that ""Raiders of the Lost Shark"""" would be a shoo-in for worst shark movie ever made, but now I am not so sure. ""90210 Shark Attack"" is a low budget David DeCoteau film set in the same huge house that DeCoteau's ""Bigfoot vs. D.B. Cooper"" was filmed in. Starring more non-actors, this one features a field trip for irresponsible entitled brats in the popular elective ""Oceanic Anthropology"". Taught by the thoroughly unconvincing Pamela Benson (Donna Wilkes), the class quickly devolves into a nerds vs. jocks throwdown, with the most horrible couple of the film award going (easily) to Marcie (Nikki BreAnne Wells) and Bryce (Braden Bacha). Trust me; you will want them to get devoured first.

Pamela tries to cozy up to weird but brainy Alyssa (Stephanie Shemanski) because she has a blockbuster book deal that she's writing about Alyssa's father, all the while spouting pompous dialogue like ""All that I know about the ocean is that she guards her secrets well"". Right. There's a loopy backstory about Alyssa's dad exploiting indigenous Mexicans who worshipped a great white shark before killing the shark in question, but then we get to DeCoteau's specialty: young buff men showering, though in this case it's creepier than you'd expect due to peeping Ms. Benson (""You like what you see?"") After seeing that scene, I feel like I need the shower!

Come the morning of the boat trip, Marcie hangs out at the house because she can't face the sea (because her dad's been missing for five years, you know?) Also sleeping in: Bryce and Marcie. That should tell veteran B-movie viewers that I'm going to get my wish. Since Bryce and Marcie are rich and cute they have to play a practical joke on Alyssa, that, believe me, isn't funny or logical. In essence Bryce entraps Alyssa into kissing him while Marcie films it on her cellphone and says she's going to post the video on the Internet. So wait: you got a nerdy girl to kiss the hunky football player and you're going to post it to embarrass her? How does that work in any Malibu high school? Never mind.

Although I have given a summary of the plot thus far, if you don't wish to know the dramatic secret of ""90210 Shark Attack"", stop reading now. When excited, Alyssa turns into a shark and bites people's heads off. No, really. May I pause a moment to say that this really was a unique twist, inasmuch as most shark movies I have seen occur near the ocean. May I also pause a moment to say that this special effect is howlingly funny. Of course when everyone comes back from their boat ride Marcie and Bryce are gone and Alyssa doesn't feel like eating because she's full. Imagine that.

Nerdy hunk (you know he's a nerd because he wears glasses and does his homework) Denny (Judson Birza) finds Marcie's cellphone and watches the video. Instead of running for his life and calling the police, he (of course) professes his undying love to Alyssa. This leads to the inescapable moral of the film: do not take a shark to bed with you. This wraps up all the myriad romantic entanglements in the film (I have left two out, including an especially illogical and unsavory one involving Pamela), and leaves only Pamela and Alyssa to round out the running time. I'll let you guess how it ends.

Produced, directed, and photographed by David DeCoteau, ""90210 Shark Attack"" is a really unique shark movie. After careful consideration I gave it one star, though I briefly considered a second star because of the extreme novelty of the shark, but it is just too painful to watch. The film is only 75 minutes long, but feels a lot longer due to the extremely repetitive padding; when the credits finally arrive you'll breathe a sigh of relief, though you might want to mute the atrocious closing credit theme song.

Extras include trailers for a lot of DeCoteau films, and a commentary track that is much more interesting than the film itself; I particularly enjoyed listening him discuss working for Roger Corman and Charles Band. To get back to my original pontification, after careful comparison and contrast I have decided that ""Raiders of the Lost Shark"" beats out ""90210 Shark Attack"" for worst shark movie in memory based on the novelty of the shark and the sometimes amusing commentary from DeCoteau. I do not recommend watching them back to back under any circumstances.",1440028800,2,4445,4.714285714285714
8680694,1,B00NW6KO64,Everyone really needs to remember - the purpose of a cover/poster is not to show you what the book/film/DVD/CD is about it is to get you to go to the movie/buy the DVD/book/CD.  Generally the relationship between the poster/cover and the actual material is minimal and/or misleading. Like almost all advertising.,1439683200,,312,5.117647058823529
8680695,1,B00NW6KO64,"Don't be fooled, this is not a killer shark movie!",1437177600,,50,4.1
8680696,1,B00NW6KO64,"it's my own fault. I will look closer from now on, anything David DeCoteau directs or the production company is Rapid heart I will pass over. Very home-erotic in spite of the inclusion of several women. Handsome and nicely built men. sub-par acting on everyone's part, bad direction and bad story. Same house as all other DeCoteau things. Why, oh, why do we have to watch a guy swim in the dirty pool for long minutes or another guy showering for very long minutes, no soap though. The old lady of the piece who is allegedly a professor is indescribably BAD, what a hag. Judson Birza as Denny, Jeffrey Decker as Pretty boy Tyler, Braden Backe as Bryce. The girls rate no mention because they shouldn't be in it at all. her comes the SPOILER.....the shark attack in question is one of the girls transforming into a shark (on dry land) and eating people's heads off?????!!!!! Terrible effect too.",1431043200,4,894,4.628930817610063
