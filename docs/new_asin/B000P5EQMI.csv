8189005,5,B000P5EQMI,"I am biased to support the production, but I know that great care and attention was paid during the writing and production to make sure that all aspects of the presentation was as honest, and authentic as possible for the viewer - making it an ideal project for anyone interested in the American Soldier of the Revolutionary War - new to re-enacting or looking to improve your authenticity - great for students of American history and for teachers in the classroom.  Highly recommended.",1329264000,3,486,4.855421686746988
8189006,4,B000P5EQMI,"I was spoiled with Lafayette the Lost Hero.  Von Steuben was too much drill, not enough about him as a person.  I didn't get a sense of his total contribution to the Rev. War effort.  The combination of narration and live action is good (but a little slow), and as a teacher of 5th graders, this  is welcomed, but Lafayette and also The Crossing catch the attention of students better.",1301097600,3,385,4.457142857142857
