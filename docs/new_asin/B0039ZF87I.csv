4099524,4,B0039ZF87I,"Now that I have done my civic duty for today (Amazon usually isn't sure about subtitles. Even the First Look Studios and ""Thirst"" websites make no mention of them), ""Thirst"" is a nice, disturbing little movie. The oppression from unending heat and sun gets practically unbearable for the viewer, so have a glass of cool water to drink nearby. Everything else these mostly likable characters try to sate their thirst with is dangerous: ""It tastes like garlic! Ha ha!""

I also can't recall seeing an actor eat a cactus in a movie: ""Don't eat that!"", says one knowing character to another who promptly screams: ""It burns!""

Now, does that realization come in addition to the pain the cactus-muncher must have felt from eating the cactus needles, or is that a different pain?

I liked the ensemble acting, the rugged scorched outdoors locales and thought this movie was much more entertaining (in the most agonizing way) than ""Open Water"".

Overlooked but recommended for fans of the ""We're stuck out here and we're going to die!"" movies.",1277251200,12,1034,4.8914285714285715
4099525,4,B0039ZF87I,"This film is very similar in concept to the film ""Open Water,"" except that there is a total lack of water, ironically, because the four characters get stranded in the desert. The film features basically only the four main characters, with Lacey Chabert in the lead role. Chabert gives an emotionally charged, convincing performance as the characters fight for survival and prove just how far they are willing to go to save themselves and each other.

Without giving spoilers away, this film is highly entertaining, and the lengths that the characters are willing to go is astounding as they are forced to make unthinkable decisions as they face the possible fate of dying in the desert of thirst. If you have read Jack London's ""To Build a Fire"" or you are a big fan of ""Open Water"" then you will adore this film. If you are looking for a ""slasher"" flick, look elsewhere. This is about as far from being a slasher film as you can get, but there are elements of terror present. The producers could have chosen to make this movie exceptionally graphic and unpleasant (and at times, it is) but overall, they took the high road and ended up with an above-average movie. This would make for an excellent rental, and I would even suggest purchasing it for fans who like this type of film.

I searched high and low for a review of this film, but I could not find one anywhere, so I wanted to make sure I took the time to review it in detail but not give too much away. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1277164800,30,1497,4.420289855072464

4099532,1,B0039ZF87I,"Thirst is probably the second worst movie I've seen this year.  I'll have to go back and painfully remember the *very* worst movie I've watched this year, but needless to say, Thirst definitely deserves the number two spot without even giving it a second thought.

A movie about four young adults that get stranded out in the desert.  Though a simplistic and not very detail-oriented storyline, you'd think such a plot couldn't possibly go horribly wrong, right?  WRONG!  This is dreadful.  Absolutely pathetic in fact.  For whatever highly bizarre reason, the acting is comparable to high school kids imitating a soap opera, and the young adults sit around and talk like a bunch of young adults talking about career aspirations and relationships.  Trust me if you're concerned you might die, you won't stop to rationally discuss the future.

The picture quality is really pour, dark and low budget.  The acting is bad and I don't care about the characters in the slightest.  Why would I?  They're all incredibly generic.  All the wrong ingredients thrown in a pot to present one atrocious film overall.  You almost have to laugh when one of the girls dies because the girl trying to save her is acting so unbelievably atrociously by giving her generic advice on how to stay alive that you can't help but snicker.  Oh and the rattlesnake that slithers near the girl (rather unrealistically)... the boyfriend smacking the snake to death with a rock was just awful.  Obviously he's swinging at nothing at all.

I suppose, just to be nice, the final 10 minutes isn't *that* bad.  Oh sure the boyfriend expresses way too much emotion and turns into a pathetic mess of tears that adds more to the soap opera theme that Thirst annoyingly features, but the scene with a swimming pool/wolf involving the one girl having to wake up in time for the purpose of saving her and the baby is actually pretty good.  As is the ending.  Of course you know how it's going to end but still, not bad.  Amazing!

If anyone can explain what kind of movie producers/writers actually think this passes for acceptable viewing material, please let me know who they are so I can tell them how I feel about the poor quality of their work.  Thirst is just really really bad.",1372723200,,2244,4.72680412371134
4099533,3,B0039ZF87I,"While watching, I actually drank at least a six pack of Diet Pepsi.  I'm not kidding, and no, I don't much like Coke, unless of course it's that diet Cherry kind.  But anyways, while guzzling drink after drink and watching scene after scene, I actually thought to myself, ""If I could sell this six pack to the actors in this film -- assuming they were really in the desert and they were really thirsty -- I'll bet that I could pay cash for a second house!""  Err, not that I would price gouge, of course.  That wouldn't be nice.

And more than likely, most viewers won't find this film very nice, I'm assuming.  It reminded me of ""127 Hours"" in a way, although I believe that that film was based upon a true story while this was probably fictitious.  And usually I find these types of films less than nice myself, as they are usually very difficult to watch.  You just know going in that bad thing after bad thing will happen to the protagonists in the film, and you also know that if there are any survivors, there will usually only be one.  And sometimes, while watching, you think, ""Well that survivor would have been luckier if he or she died at the beginning,"" at least after taking another sip off that Pepsi and shaking your head.

I did get a few minor laughs though.  One of the gals in the film plays a model, and let's just say she makes an unintended sacrifice that everyone else in the group should be happy about, as it means that the rest of the group will have a bigger ""share.""  And in another very ironic scene, you find that that same model might actually have saved someone else by earlier having what may be deemed as ""unnecessary surgery.""  So it's not all doom and gloom here.

Early on I noticed Tygh Runyan, an actor that played Randall Woodfield -- a real-life serial killer who briefly played for the Packers -- in the film ""The Hunt for the I-5 Killer.""  Mr. Runyan surely plays a more sympathetic character here, and at one point he makes a sacrifice as well, similar to the model.  I found this scene to be slightly cheesy, with undertones -- or overtones, take your pick -- of religiosity.  I laughed during that scene even though I believe that was not the director's intent, so that was most likely a misfire.

Well, while sipping another Pepsi and writing this review, I came up with a possible reason that ""Thirst"" was green-lighted:  concession sales have been low lately, and theater owners want them to be increased.  This film surely would do that.  I watched this at home, but if I'd been in the theater, I figure I would have dropped at least 20 bucks.  And that would have been only on the Pepsis.",1370908800,,2638,4.418219461697722
4099534,4,B0039ZF87I,"Two couples--a model and a photographer, and a pregnant woman and her husband--venture into the deep desert for a photo shoot.  Things go horribly wrong when their car crashes after nearly hitting a wolf.  The overall idea of ""Thirst"" has been done many times before: nobody knows they are out there and no one will notice their absence for days.  There is hope, however.  Their map shows a town to the west that they could try walking to.  But the desert is merciless, and there are only so many bottles of water to ration among themselves.  It was at this point that the movie happily diverged from my expectations.  I expected the characters to turn on each other.  After all, this is a horror movie!  And, indeed, there is some of that.  For example, after one of the characters dies, the remaining characters argue over who should get the dead person's water.  However, the negative aspects of human nature are not the ultimate focus of ""Thirst.""  Instead, we are given likable characters who go to great lengths to try to save each other, though at times quite futilely.  Yes, this is a horror movie--characters do meet their deaths in rather violent and gruesome ways (although it not excessively shown).  But, in the process, we are shown a side of human nature that is sometimes quite moving.  You will have to suspend disbelief at times, as a few rather unlikely things will occur.  As a whole, however, ""Thirst"" works in a very convincing way.",1355270400,,1454,4.687747035573122

4099538,5,B0039ZF87I,"I could have rated this movie 3 stars, but it deserves more credit than what other critics are saying. Despite being a low-budget film with beer-rationed paid actors/actresses, it was very moving. I would be expecting a big hollywood production to recreate a movie like this one with more dramatic scenes, higher paid actors/actresses, and possibly special effects somewhere down in the future. Never expected star like Lacey Chabert would come from big screen roles to star in films like this. Well... times are tough in this recession even for the actors/actresses.",1346284800,,567,5.173913043478261
4099539,2,B0039ZF87I,Going into this I had no idea what to expect.  Unfortunately I wasn't wowed by this movie.  It was very slow and very predictable.  You can look at this movie as a drawn out explanation of what NOT to do when you go into remote areas and what NOT to do when you find yourself stranded.  Only mildly entertaining with very flat acting.,1345593600,,334,4.253968253968254
4099540,4,B0039ZF87I,"I only watched half of the movie, after the crash is when I started it so I don't know about the beginning but from that part and on it was very very good. Yes the acting at times was a bit fake but not that much, just a few times.
It was suspenseful and had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. It was a good movie so I'm not sure why all the bad reviews. Maybe if I had watched it from the beginning it would have turned me off or something. I don't know but what I saw was really good and there is a little messed up part towards the end which was unexpected. Good movie though. It made me keep reaching for my water bottle a lot. I could feel their pain and what they were going through and any movie or characters that can transcend the screen and make the viewer feel something, is a pretty good movie. Of course it wasn't the best movie in the world I mean what movie is?",1341273600,,901,3.92896174863388

Seriously, I have seen nepotism at work in film...I have seen ""vanity projects""....this dreadful excuse for a movie takes BOTH of those concepts to a whole new level. I don't know who Lacy Chabert THINKS she is, but good God, not even Hollywood royalty could get away with this level of masturbatory self-aggrandizing. Basically, in a nutshell, here is all you need to know about ""Thirst"": everyone who is NOT Lacy Chabert is either a whore, a moron, an ass or some combination of all three and EVERYONE except Lacy Chabert's sweet little angel of a genius of a character DESERVES to die in horrible, horrible ways, sometimes at the hands of Lacy herself.

4099542,2,B0039ZF87I,"This is a fairly cut and dry story. Two young couples go into a remote part of the desert to shoot photos of Mercedes McNab in a bikini and most of them don't make it out. Noelle (Lacey Chabert) is moody because she has morning sickness and is having second thoughts about the maturity of her boyfriend. She reminded me too much of my ex and I wanted her to shut up and die, while Mercedes reminded me of the woman I will only dream about. The film is compared to ""Open Water"" and indeed it is just as boring. This is a ninety minute movie that should take you 30 minutes to watch. We simply don't see enough of Mercedes McNab to save the film.

No sex or nudity.",1334793600,,663,4.1
4099543,1,B0039ZF87I,"This movie was nothing original or interesting. Two couples go off into the desert on vacation so one can take pics of his new fashion model girlfriend. For the first ten minutes we see the two female stars romp around in bikinis, probably to make the film more appealing to men but whatever, nothing makes this film appealing.

This movie is bland, boring and full of bad acting and cheap production. The actors acted like they just got out of acting school a year earlier or needed to go. The movie looked like a college production from a film student. The movies were full of ridiculous cliche events.

Couples run car into a rock to avoid a wolf.

One woman is superwoman AKA nurse who tries to do surgery on emergency surgery with her bare hands.

They go through bouts of thirst and sink to ridiculous measures.

They happen to be trapped where no one but them were dumb enough to get trapped in.

And on, and on, and on. NOTHING original. It is like a million other movies but with poor scenery and nerve-cringing acting. This movie is horrible. I saw it on Showtime and thank goodness I didn't waste money on it. The only thing good about this movie is that it's over. I kept watching just to see how bad it got and in that aspect I wasn't disappointed.

If you wanna see decent movies with people trapped in deserts, try 72 Hours or The Canyon. Anything but this.",1326844800,,1372,4.420634920634921
4099544,2,B0039ZF87I,"This is one of those typical plot lines that goes around in circles. But to make matters worse it also jumps around, in dream stages that have no real meaning in the context of the movie.

4099545,1,B0039ZF87I,It is so sad that actress Lacey Chabert has lowered herself to this level of film...if you want to call it that.  I always thought she was a budding star and would emerge among the cream of the crop some day...definitely not in this dreadful low-budget bomb.  It was slower than a crippled snail...horrible script...high school calibre acting.  I hope Lacey emerges in a much better role.  I won't hold this one against her.

As with most movies you can pretty much sense trouble from the start and you're immediately thinking ""oh great, another one of these"".  Try to stay out of that mind frame as this movie really makes you think about how far you'd be willing to go if you were in the situation.  There are some emotional moments and I would agree with the comparison to Open Water.",1311206400,,534,4.115384615384615

It is the story of four rather silly people who take off into the desert on a photo shoot with very few supplies and not much water.  After their car is smashed, they face the dilemma of trying to walk out of the merciless desert heat.  And one of them is pregnant....and another has a concussion and a hematoma.  I do not want to spoil it any further. Suffice to say that you will feel the suffering.

The acting could have been better from the guys, but the gals were pretty good, esp. Lacey Chabert.",1308355200,,559,4.235849056603773
4099549,3,B0039ZF87I,"The setup is simple, and the plot meandering and not terribly realistic in Thirst (2010), where two couples face a crisis situation in the desert.  Major spoilers follow, so proceed at your own discretion.

Tyson (Brandon Quinn), a fashion photographer, is headed off to a remote desert location to do a photo shoot with Atheria (Mercedes McNab) a model.  Also along are Tyson's friend Bryan (Tygh Runyan), and his wife Noelle (Lacey Chabert) who is studying to be a doctor.  The group travels deep into the desert, and begins the photo shoot.  While looking for a new location, their vehicle runs off the road, and Atheria is injured.  With their vehicle undrivable and no cell phone service (of course), the group faces a situation they are totally unprepared for.  Noelle reveals that she is pregnant, which heightens the couple's drive to survive.

The intent of the film, is to show the outrageous acts people will do, when under extreme pressure.  The first of which is some makeshift ""brain surgery"", involving Noelle taking a screwdriver to Atheria skull, even though she has no definite knowledge where the pressure on her brain may be.  Evidently Noelle is unaware of the Hippocratic oath, which includes taking no action that may harm a patient, or engaging in a practice without being qualified.  It is a pretty effective scene, but unfortunately the model does not survive, and after burying her body, the three survivors decide to try and walk to safety.

This is where the film really starts to lose credibility.  The group came into the desert totally unprepared, with only a bag of chips, and some bottles of water.  No one wears their sunglasses or hats, and Noelle heads off into the desert, wearing a sleeveless blouse and slippers.  These people should be severely dehydrated and sunburned after a few hours, and Noelle's feet should be rubbed raw, but it doesn't happen in the days that follow.  Throughout their journey, the survivors look much too healthy.  They manage to kill a rattlesnake and drink its blood, but then instead of keeping it for food, they throw it away.

The trek through the desert, is mostly a series of unrelated scenes connected together, where the geography doesn't really match up.  Instead of travelling during the cooler parts of the day as they say is their intention, they often seem to be on the move when the sun is high overhead.  The gross out moments, that are largely what this film is about, continue, as Noelle and Bryan drink their own urine, and later even more shocking, Noelle turns into a vampire.  In the end, the hapless travelers somehow manage the impossible, arriving at the same place they left.

With Lacey Chalbert as one of the executive producers, it's hardly surprising that mother-to-be Noelle, survives.  Only at the very end, does she even look as dirty, sun baked, and dehydrated as she should have much earlier.  There is a nice twist, where a breast implant of all things, plays a key role in her survival.  The actors do the best with what they have, and the performances are actually pretty good, as the characters are not complete morons.  The film's problems are mostly related to the location, and the way the scenes are edited together doesn't always make for a very believable story.  While it's possible for a group to be so totally unprepared, it's not likely that they would have survived as long as these people did.

With an emphasis on the different fluids that the survivors drink, Thirst does live up to its name.  Besides walking in the desert, there really isn't much action to speak of.  The film has solid production values, and the desert cinematography is a plus, although if you pay attention to it, the continuity between scenes often does not match, as they appear to be shot at different times of the day.  It's hard to control lighting on location, and it appears to be too much of a challenge here.  Still, if you block out all the unrealistic elements, and just take it for what it is intended to be, a look at the extreme things people will do to survive, Thirst does have some entertainment value.",1306713600,9,4111,4.762711864406779
4099550,3,B0039ZF87I,"Having spent many years in remote areas of the southwestern US desert I enjoyed the main topics of this movie, being lost without water and the fight to survive. The film has good character development and a few novel plot twists. What killed me was watching people make really stupid choices, like sleeping in the cool night and walking in the day in the blistering sun instead of the other way around. I can't fault that here though because when people get severely dehydrated and overheated common sense is the first thing to go and bad choices are precisely what happens. In this case they only make things more realistic. Some of the choices are most surprising and the end is satisfactory. I rented this movie because I wanted to see how Lacey Chabert's acting career is progressing and was not disappointed in her performance. This film is a good way to spend some time and is not the same old thing you've seen a million times before.

You know, through most of this unrealistic movie, I was thinking to myself Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) did this better, and the original The Road Warrior (1981) did it even better than that.

Unfortunately, there are too many problems with this pointless movie; horrible acting, awful script, absolutely stupid couples, predictable and drawn out scenes. The movie/script starts to head down the crap path after 1 minute, it is so trite and awful.

What it lacks in action it makes up for with character development ,gross out moments,great dialogue and storyline.
The fact that Lacy Chambert's character is almost a doctor""ready to graduate medical school""  lends to the credibility of a lot the storyline that would have been impossible to pull off had she been anything else .It wouldn't have worked even if she were a nurse.
There are some real bite your pillow tense and gross out moments that are very well done and lend to the movies memorability factor. It even has a You can be human and a Vampire too kinda vibe in parts. Although It is in no way a Vampire flick.
I enjoyed it more than Open Water but not as Much as Adam Green's Frozen.
I saw it on demand but may buy it because I could see myself watching it again.
