8445615,4,B001HN6POE,"I saw this on netflicks and want to own it but it not available in Canada. Waiting for this to be available. I loved this movie, Eddie as always is great in this movie.",1435881600,,168,3.9705882352941178
8445616,3,B001HN6POE,"A comedy mixing Middle Ages stories amateur actors performing and their daily reality of family affairs and surrounding.

A time might be spent for something more delighting.",1271548800,,174,5.444444444444445
8445617,4,B001HN6POE,"I caught this on IFC the other night and am hugely disappointed that I can't find it to rent/own myself, as it's one of thsse independent films that has such a sense of fun and ultimate sweetness about it that you want to watch it again AND you want to share it with friends. As the previous reviewer noted, the bedroom scene in Klingon is just a hoot, but there are many genuinely funny moments throughout. If you get a chance, give this little film a shot--you won't be disappointed.",1269734400,5,485,4.4
8445618,4,B001HN6POE,"I live in the US and stumbled across this while surfing through On-Demand selections from Comcast. My wife an I absolutely loved it. If you are a fan of the geek and the underdog and are a hopeless romantic to boot, this is a movie for you.

Our favorite scene: the romantic bedroom chat...in Klingon!

If you liked the movie ""Fanboys"", chances are, you'll like this too.",1261526400,4,371,4.522388059701493
