The new one unfortunately has the same issue in only one area but would have preferred not having to get a new one that wasn't that much better than what I had.
Information is invaluable and I show it 3 times a year to over 75 kids and teens and like the info and presentation. Also the self defense section is great since getting away is #1 rather than the kids who say, ""I took Karate for 4 years and no one can mess with me, just let em try!""  I explain that street fighters and bullies don't have fear about you hurting them as their form of bullying doesn't have a choreographed response to your cool moves you learned in a Karate/Tak Won Do, etc. class!",1402704000,,799,4.148387096774194
