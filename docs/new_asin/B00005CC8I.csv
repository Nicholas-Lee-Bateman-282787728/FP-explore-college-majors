1425402,4,B00005CC8I,"A cultish favourite that is often listed for festivals of noir cinema, this work is less noirish than it is a clear example from the Theatre of Paranoia, as Dick Powell's directorial debut melds nuclear explosion fears with a harrowing hostage taking by two escaped convicts fleeing from a Nevada prison. The escapees, Sam (Stephen McNally) and Bart (Paul Kelly) helped by mute accomplice Dummy (Frank DeKova), take refuge in an abandoned mining town, Yucca Flats, along with six prisoners they acquire during their flight, despite their awareness that the desert ghost town is within a nuclear test site where, in 12 hours, a combined military force is going to explode a tower bomb armed with high grade scissile plutonium. Sam believes that he and his two cohorts will be able to evade a protective army encirclement and escape prior to the blast, but the uncertain fate of their hapless hostages becomes the oarlock for the film's atmosphere of foreboding, with one of the captives, played by Keith Andes, being a Las Vegas newspaper reporter who has full knowledge of the detonation schedule, having attended planning meetings during which the event's timetable has been established. For Powell's initial effort as a director of features, he selects a restricted environment, essentially one large room, as setting for his limited cast of featured players, with the bomb becoming an additional sinister character. Following initial lead-in scenes, including interlaced footage of actual soldiers and military technicians, a stage mise-en-scne is established to advance an atmosphere of suspense. Unfortunately, Powell's inexperience with ensemble work is in evidence here, as the players generally simply take turns with their readings, although a good deal of the dialogue is trenchant. The villainous trio is the most interesting of the cast, with Kelly taking the acting palm for his strong yet low-keyed turn as one who was severely wounded during the prison break, and Richard Egan is convincing as a physician gulled into performing surgery upon Bart, while on the distaff side talented Jan Sterling handily outperforms the histrionic Alexis Smith. Shot in California's Mojave Desert, this work benefits from R.K.O.s master cinematographer with black and white stock, Nick Musuraca, and there is an appropriately dramatic score from Roy Webb. A nearly fatal flaw is the artless attitude toward the dangerous effects of atomic radiation, although it must be conceded that applicable information available to the general public was scanty at the time of the film's production.",1107993600,6,2585,5.322738386308068

If you are looking for footage of the nuclear tests, this looks like part of the Desert Rock series.  The first five minutes are devoted to preparation, then follows the story, with a few minutes in a control bunker towards the end.",1433376000,,480,4.431818181818182

1425408,4,B00005CC8I,"Musical star turned film-noir hero Dick Powell makes his directorial debut in this taut and tense drama.
Killer Sam Hurley and two companions escape from prison and take 5 hostages to a deserted mining town in
Nevada which is ground zero for an A-Bomb test the next day.  A doctor is among the hostages taken to tend
to Hurley's injured companion.  As the clock ticks down to 'zero hour', who will survive?",1378252800,2,406,4.625
1425409,4,B00005CC8I,"When convicts Stephen McNally and Paul Kelly break out of prison and make a run for it, they pick up several hostages along the way including Jan Sterling and Alexis Smith plus a few others.  Eventually, they take refuge in an abandoned desert mining town.  Just one big problem...this town is only a few miles from an atomic test site and the bomb is scheduled to go off next morning.  This film is fairly fast moving with not a lot of long dialogue passages.  In many ways, it resembles ""Key Largo"" where Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are held hostage by gangster Edward G. Robinson.  Considering that it was probably filmed on a low budget, this one keeps up the suspense until the very end.  Stephen McNally, Jan Sterling, Richard Egan and Alexis Smith all turn in good performances.  This film is not well known and probably did not do well at the box office; however, the tension builds nicely as we near zero hour.  If you've never seen it, you have missed a good little thriller and you won't guess the ending.",1345420800,,1022,4.546448087431694
1425410,1,B00005CC8I,"The movie itself is well done and well made.  But in two tries I was unable to get a disk that played on our DVD player!  We have never had a problem with any other DVD, other than once or twice an unexpected spot of digital breakup, which AMAZON replaced for us at no charge.  Glitches happen.  But we ordered this disk twice and both times it appeared what we were sent had never been recorded:  it was blank.  Therefore, I don't recommend this.  The movie is good but I'll wait until it comes out from another vendor to buy the disk.",1325203200,2,536,4.196078431372549
1425411,5,B00005CC8I,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""SPLIT SECOND"" (1953) (85 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Stephen McNally, Alexis Smith, Jan Sterling, Keith Andes, Arthur Hunnicutt, Paul Kelly & Richard Egan -- Directed by Dick Powell

Actor Dick Powell made an impressive film debut with the taut atomic-age suspensor Split Second --- Convicts Stephen McNally, Paul Kelly and Frank DeKova escape to a ghost town in the Nevada desert --- Only it isn't exactly a ghost town, but a ""dummy village"" constructed for the purpose of A-bomb testing --- The criminals hold several hostages, including reporter Keith Andes, nightclub singer Jan Sterling, selfish socialite Alexis Smith, her doctor-husband Richard Egan and her newest boyfriend Robert Paige --- Andes suspects that the deserted town is at Ground Zero of the latest bomb test, but he can't convince the convicts until it's almost too late --- The best and most horrifying sequence occurs near the end, when the criminals, accompanied by the duplicitous Ms. Smith, discover that they're driving towards the A-bomb target instead of away from it.

Novelist Irving Wallace collaborated on the script of Split Second with Chester Erskine and William Bowers.

This started out as a ""B-Film"" that rates the ""A Plus Film Noir"" for rating, showing what could be done with the right chemistry of the director, cast and producer -- What more can an avid noir film collector ask for.

1425412,4,B00005CC8I,"The government is doing nuclear tests in the middle of the Nevada desert. They plan to bomb a ghost town at 6 am and have evacuated the town. Reporter Larry Fleming (Keith Andes) is covering the story until he is assigned to a breaking story; a killer (Stephen McNally) has escaped from jail and is in the area. He takes along a girl (Jan Sterling) with him to Carson City, but on the way, he is stopped by convict Sam Hurley himself. Hurley has kidnapped a couple (Robert Paige, Alexis Smith) and called the woman's doctor husband (Richard Egan) to get him to fix his partner's wound. He chooses a less than ideal hideout: the ghost town in the middle of the bomb site.

This was Dick Powell's first screen credit as a director, and he recieved good notices for his work. It is difficult to create atmosphere in the desert which offers little variety in the way of locations, but Powell works well with the outdoors. When the action moves indoors to an abandoned barroom, he manages to convey the claustrophobia of the captives. His direction is not fancy; he does what he needs to do to set the mood, but there is nothing overly beautiful about his work. The actors do a good job of aiding the tension of the film, and Paul Kelly gives a standout character performance as the old prospector.

Interestingly enough, nuclear testing sites played a major role in Powell's life a few years later when he directed The Conqueror. The film was shot in the desert on grounds that had once been used for nuclear tests. Rumor has it that the location contributed to almost half of the cast and crew's contraction of cancer.",1220659200,,1615,4.546391752577319

Gonna go ahead and leave a comment in my response to watching it. Loved it and truly an amazing show. Can you imagine these people being held up in what will soon become a test site for an A-bomb test by some escaped criminals and having no idea when the zero hour is. OhMyGoodness when the zero hour did come it was so intense that I shut my eyes when I saw what that bomb did to the 3 in the car. Just a mouth wide open scene for me and I though maybe they'd escape, but WOW!...like I said, gonna own this movie because it was indeed worth being among my collection and rated as ""TENSE DRAMA.""",1496880000,,736,3.97972972972973
7938079,5,B00005CC8I,"A very intense early movie about  criminals holding civilian hostages in a deserted town that will be used in an atomic bomb test in Nevada the next moring. The criminals believe that the police won't search,the town before the test time which will be at 6:00 a.m. There is tremenmdous drama between the crimminals inside a room in the town as a cat an mouse develops between the criminals and the hostages. As fate would have it, the atomic test is moved up to 5.00 a.m. wothout everyone knowing it, and there is ony 15 minutes till it happens. The movie climaxes as the criminals race to get out of the test town and the hoistages need to find refuge somwhere before the explosion.

I leave the ending to the viewers so as not to spoil the climax..",1490140800,,750,4.427536231884058
