""Is this a publicity stunt by Axel Rose ?""
""...Prelude to finally releasing Chinese Democracy cd???""
This Horror Rock movie is pretty entertaining, Albeit an adventure in gore.
The two leads (Colby-Axel?, Lisa as Antonette LeVey?) are very good in roles and lend a extra creepiness to Guns `N Roses coincidences.
Lots of slashing, not GUNS (LOL) were used in executions !
Soundtrack by Hollywood Roses and others is very good, Which would be a problem for a Rock Band - themed movie.",1225670400,,550,4.913978494623656
