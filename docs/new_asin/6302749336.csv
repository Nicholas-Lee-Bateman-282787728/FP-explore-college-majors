505653,5,6302749336,"The best thing about this video is that it doesn't dress people in clothes I'd never be seen in.

Next, it doesn't have that music and smiling exercise leaders that evoke memories of a purple dinosaur.

It has people from all backgrounds.

It has men who look like they work out and men who look like they are just doing the step video.

The music alone would get my blood running.

I have loved this video ever since my mom gave it to me for Christmas years ago.

Plus what everyone else said.

Please, make this into a DVD. It's a classic!",1120780800,5,541,4.245098039215686
505654,4,6302749336,"I received this video with the purchase of my Reebok Step.  Just a note about the gray and black Reebok Step, it's much better than the original green flexible step.  When I first previewed the tape I wasn't impressed.  The set looks kind of dark, with techno music and all these fantastic looking aerobics instructors for class participants.  I thought... here we go.  I am glad I gave this tape a chance because it is now considered one of my core favorites out of a collection of about 100 exercise tapes and DVDs.

Right off the bat this tape scores points by putting all the hints and instructions on proper techniques at the end of the tape so that you don't have to fast forward through it every time you use it.  The other thing it did, which is a very nice feature, at the end of the step segment there is a short toning section with pushups and ab work.  Something you can skip if you want depending on your goals for that day.

The actual step workout is truly basic moves with step, knee ups, cross overs and t steps being as complicated as it gets.  What I liked the most about this straight forward tape is the coordinated arm movements that allow you to target your heart rate to the level you want along with the normal option of adjusting your step height.  I am in good enough shape that if I want to stay in my fat burning zone this tape is just right but if I want a heart conditioning workout then I have to use weight gloves on my hands to get my heart elevated enough.  So it depends on your goals.  Sometimes uncomplicated, good camera work, excellent cueing are all you want when you workout.

I would have given it 5 stars but I just couldn't get past the super disco look of the stage and all those cute well meaning class participants.",1105142400,28,1763,4.303030303030303
505655,5,6302749336,"I've tried many, many workout tapes over the years and this one is still my favorite. A lot of the step workouts are SO complicated but this one isn't. The instruction is very clear and easy to follow. The music is awesome, really gets you into it. And the workout is one of the best. I can always feel it the next day. Now if I could just find a DVD copy of it to replace my well-worn VHS tape!",1104624000,6,395,3.95
505656,5,6302749336,"This video actually came with the step that I bought several years ago, and I've been using it ever since.  Every so often I start to feel bored with the routine so I buy a different video, but always end up going back to this one after a short time.
I found that the routines are very simple to get down after a few tries, and that the cueing is just about perfect.  There are no bubbly instructors or complicated dance moves (things that annoy me), but rather straightforward instructions and moves that really get my pulse rate going.
The video is split into three basic parts - The first stepping section includes warmup and stretching and lasts for about 25 minutes.  It's followed by a heart rate check.  The second stepping section lasts about 8-10 more minutes, then there is another heart rate check followed by the cooldown.  The final section focuses on toning exercises for arms and abs, as well as stretching.  It's easy to do one or both of the stepping sections depending on my energy level, and I may or may not do the toning (the ab section is kind of sad).
All in all, it's a great video that I find much better than either Kathy Smith or Jane Fonda's step routines.  I give it 5 stars!",1089849600,15,1204,4.396396396396397
505657,5,6302749336,"This is by far my favorite step workout.  The music has a good beat, the moves are easy to follow, and it's just the right length.  It only took me a few workouts to get all the moves and transitions down, and I am pretty much an uncoordinated bumbling idiot when it comes to aerobic workouts.  There is a  push-up, tricep dip, ab workout at the end that is short enough not to kill you but good for extra toning.  But because it is the very last part of the workout, it is easy to skip if you just want the aerobic workout.",1086220800,4,524,4.048543689320389
505658,4,6302749336,"Ten years after purchasing this video (and step assembly, I still love it. The workouts are amazingly intense, and keep you feeling fit in a vibrant, almost exhausting way. Not for the meek, and definitely invest in good sneakers!
The video can be followed without a step assembly (moves can be adapted for flat floor surfaces) and you can modify the moves to match any pace you desire - just follow the guidelines for target heart rates.
3x a week is my ideal maintenance schedule, and this workout is FUN! Give it a try!

505659,4,6302749336,"I started using this video in college. My step aerobics instructor used this for our PE tests so that she would be able to observe and score us. I appreciate this video more than any other step video that I've ever used.
I love the music. The industrial setting is an interesting variation to the basic ""workout room"" setting that you see in so many videos. Mostly, I cannot begin to count the times my friends or I have commented on the perky and annoying facial expressions or attitudes of the instructors. Obviously they enjoy fitness, but most times it comes across as fake on videos. I appreciate the fact that Gin Miller is no-nonsense, ""let's just do it"" in this video. I find that I respond much better to that attitude. I enjoy working out and I am motivated to do so, but I don't enjoy videos in which instructors seem more like cheerleaders.
I would highly recommend this video to anyone who has similar preferences. I do alternate it with other videos so it doesn't become repetitious for me, but it is my favorite of all the aerobics videos I own. You can't find any better for step than Gin Miller.",1039392000,12,1112,4.482758620689655
505660,5,6302749336,"I've never before wished a workout video were longer until I got this one. I like the industrial setting, absolutely love the music, and I find it to be a nice break from all the videos with complicated steps. The workout is not too strenuous, it gradually builds in intensity, and brings you to a good sweat. The moves in the beginning are very basic and easy, but after doing so many complicated videos, I liked getting back to the basics and not having to think real hard about how to copy what they're doing on tv. The music is really the best of any workout video I own, and I have about 20 of them. It's techno/electronic and really gets you moving. The toning at the end is too short to get much benefit from, so I do it twice if I have time. Overall, it's a medium-intensity but highly enjoyable video.",1017273600,9,810,4.300653594771242
505661,5,6302749336,"I Felt compelled to write after reading the last entry on 3/1/2002.  I bought this video about 10 years ago and it is still one of my favorites.  It is repetitive, however, when I first started working out 10 years ago, I needed something that could teach me how to do the basic step moves...this video does just that.  After a long days work, I need to work out but do not have the bandwidth to concentrate on learning something new, or trying odd combinations.  The music is fabulous to listen to, there are some parts that just ""get you going"" and get you pumped for the next segment of moves.  This video is for anyone who would love to try step, who needs a video that will teach him or her.  This is also a video that, once you become proficient at it, it's a video that you know, and you get your workout done!  Especially when you come home from a hard days work and you just really don't want to do it....but you do!",1016236800,17,925,4.192090395480226
505662,5,6302749336,"I bought this video after using Gin Miller's Best of Step Reebok TV workout.  These two videos are very different.  Whereas the Best of video is informal with a lot of vocal interaction and silliness among the steppers, this video reminds me of Orwell's ""1984.""  The background steppers are nameless with blank expressions. Gin Miller is among the steppers counting down moves with hand signals while the instructor is Miller's face on a TV screen.  The steppers seem to be stepping on metal grating with light shining from below.  A live African band provides the pumping music.  The setting is very industrial.
Whereas the atmosphere is a little intimidating, the workout is not.  The moves (including arm movements) are very simple and are done with a lot of repetition.  The first part of the workout I would classify as beginner/lower intermediate (one can always add propulsion, of course).  After the heart rate check, the workout gets a little more heart-pounding with a challenging lunge and straddle combination.
The last segment of the workout includes 3 sets of pushups,
lat pull downs, and ab crunches.  The ab crunches seem a little
skimpy for me (about 4 different crunches at only 8 reps each with rests in between.  I usually do crunches straight through).
A good workout that is not too challenging but also doesn't leave you feeling that you cheated yourself.",1014854400,23,1378,4.947826086956522
505696,5,6302749336,You can't go wrong with this. The classics is where it's at. Everyone should have this. Her voice over is a God send. What would I do without Gin Miller. So glad after all these years I could bring this back into my life.,1513641600,,221,4.045454545454546
505697,5,6302749336,I like this one better.,1513555200,,23,3.8
505698,3,6302749336,"I'm a former step instructor of 6 years.  I bought four videos that feature Gin Miller.  Her cueing is good and she uses consistent terminology the whole way through (switching terminology for the same step was a complaint I had about the Cathe Friedrich basic step DVD that came packaged with my step).

The simplicity of the choreography makes this video great for beginners.  Though be warned that the tempo of the music (which follows original Step Reebok guidelines of 118 to 122 bpm) makes the workout more intense on the cardio.  Deconditioned exercisers will almost certainly want to begin with the 4"" step height and steppers accustomed to modern choreography and tempo may want to lower the step one level to ensure endurance through the entire duration of the video.

I have just one complaint:  musicality.  There's a spot in the video where she does a step one extra time and it took her off of the phrase.  Back in the old days people didn't care much about much about matching musical phrasing because the steps weren't extremely complex, but as the choreography has advanced it has become a requirement of group fitness instructors that they identify and teach with the 32-count phrase.  Being one 8-count behind the phrase can throw me off because there is one repetition left after the music tells me that the set should be over.

If you don't know what I meant in that previous paragraph, you shouldn't have any problems with this DVD.",1510704000,,1454,4.776

And I was so disappointed when I got it and realized it didn't even have the most basic kind of chaptering, or menu.  At the beginning, it even talks about the instructional ""at the end of the tape"", and after you watch it, ""set a breakpoint so that you can rewind to this point"".  Well, they didn't even bother to separate out the instructional and the rest of the dvd.  So, you have to fast forward past the warnings and commercials to start it again.  It is more work to use it regularly than the old tape.

I really liked Gin Miller, thought she was a great instructor. but I'm really bummed she put out something like this.  It is not like she even had to create it again.  All she had to do was make a user friendly copy of the old VHS tape for DVD.  It isn't that cheap.  She must have needed some money quick to put this little effort into this.  If I was just basing my review on the workout, I would give it 5 stars, but I knocked it down a couple of stars because of the lack of effort to make this user friendly.",1470700800,2,1164,3.987012987012987

505808,5,6302749336,"I had this on VHS in the mid to late 90's and into the very early 2000's.  When DVD took over, I never replaced it.  However, I just recently bought the DVD, and I'm SO glad I did!  This video is timeless - I loved it then (in my 20's), and I love it now (I'm 48 with ""bad"" knees & chronic lower back pain).  Gin Miller is an excellent instructor with flawless cuing.  This is a high-calorie burn workout WITHOUT the ""wish I could fall over & nap now"" factor.  There's also NO DREAD element to this - I like step, and I really enjoy this.  I'm not the fittest person, but I used to be, and I'm getting myself back into shape.  This is perfect.  The footwork is basic but varied, and, along with the arm work, keeps things interesting and engaging.  The live music is excellent, the setting is kind of like a nightclub/warehouse studio but in a very cool way with funky - but not distracting - lighting, and there's a large group of people working out with Gin who is delivering verbal cues from modern-looking TV screens (very Videodrome!) but physical cues because she's doing the exercises along with everyone else.  While your butt & thighs, and even arms, get a  solid workout on the step, at the end you do 3 sets of push-ups and 3 sets of tricep dips from the step.  Lastly, you do 3 basic sets of abs including obliques.  It's all very manageable and time flies. You feel thoroughly worked out but NOT exhausted to the point of misery.  Quite the contrary - It's a lot of fun (well, about as fun as a workout can get!), there's no ""dread factor,"" as I've said, and the foot and arm work is basic, not dance-y or fancy.  You can concentrate on energy and form rather than choreography that, if confusing or intricate, could cause injury.  In short, this is a WONDERFUL workout!  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  It has been a favorite of mine for many years, and Gin Miller is as good as it gets - The Step Queen.",1457395200,13,1925,4.253443526170799

It was a super great workout (i lost a ton of weight, sweated like crazy) and I always enjoyed this particular Reebok Step workout with Gin Miller (The Power one is awesome, too). The way it was produced, it was ahead of it's time. Just the music alone motivates you! Other step workouts just didn't compare. Yeah, there are more 'modern' and probably better exercises now, ie.trx, kettlebell, p90x, hiit, BUT I personally don't find them fun to do and end up giving up(perseverance is not my strong suit). But this is a workout I can do everyday and not get sick of. Thank you so much Gin Miller for making it into a DVD!!!!

I appreciate that Step Reebok:The Video assumes you know the steps and simply starts the program. If you need it, there is at the end of the video (or DVD) in the last 8 minutes a section on how to do each step. That way beginners have proper instruction, and those who have stepped before can jump right in and turn off the DVD once it gets to the instructional last 8 minutes.

The Step Reebok Power workout is also one of my favourites!!!!  You should get that too for when you are more fit.

COMPLAINT: for all workout dvds. Why can't the producers recognize that no matter how proud they may be of their music soundtrack it will still NEVER be good enough for many of us!!!! As a result .... and thank god for ipods which have made the creation of our own workout music so easy peasy .... many of us have our own playlists! Why can' they produce a workout with a ""no music"" option so we can still follow the directions easily and enjoy our playlist?????? Still today in 2012 we can't have an easy time hearing the instructors voice with our own personal playlists without the confusion of their music soundtrack. UNbelievable!!!! It's so elementary.

No overly complicated footwork, no unnecessary cheerful banter, no Good Morning America style set... just a solid workout with excellent real-time instruction by Gin Miller.

Very basic steps with lots of coordinating arm movements, which were a little difficult at first to get down pat.  But as with most workouts after a few viewings, I can follow the instructions easier.  What's really fun about this video is how retro it is with the music and fashion.

505954,5,6302749336,"This is literally *the* original step workout video, and it launched a trend that dominated the fitness world of the 1990's.  The production is quite dated; the lighting, music, and editing have a ""Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch"" feel, and in fact the back of the box says that they gave it ""the look and feel of a music video.""  The men all look like American Gladiators, and the women have some... interesting haircuts.  However, this does not detract from the quality of the workout.  The moves are simple, the cuing is spot-on, and the percussive soundtrack makes it easy to stay on pace.  This is an excellent video for beginners or intermediate steppers, and particularly for those of us who don't like dancey motions or complicated choreography.  By varying the step height, increasing your range of motion, and adding high-impact moves, this workout will stay fresh for quite a while.  The VHS version of Step Reebok: The Video was one of the first workout videos I ever owned, and it's still a favorite.

That said, Step Reebok be a bit much for brand-newbies; 50 minutes can be quite grueling at first.  If you're just starting out, you could work through the first break (the workout stops a couple times to allow you to check your pulse), then skip to the cooldown/stretch section at the end.  Once you're comfortable with that, work through the first two segments, then work your way up to the whole video.  If you've never done step before, you can get a feel for the basic steps by watching the 8-minute tutorial at the end, or you can get a more detailed introduction in Gin Miller's introductory video,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everybody-Steps-A-guide-to-step-aerobics/dp/B0009WIY4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everybody Steps: A guide to step aerobics</a>.  The latter option is also a good way to build your endurance for Step Reebok: The Video, other beginning step workouts, or a live class.

Perhaps the biggest negative with this product is not the workout, but the medium.  The disc is unchaptered, meaning the Skip feature doesn't work like you'd expect it to.  You have to Fast Forward and Rewind to get past the ads at the beginning, or to move ahead to the cooldown and the tutorial.  If you're used to VHS tapes, this drill will be all too familiar to you.  Likewise, there's no menu to speak of, neither a home menu nor a Chapter Select screen.  It's a minor inconvenience, particularly if you plan to do the whole workout, but it does give the product a cheap feeling, like it was made on somebody's home computer.  This may have simply been the state of the technology at the time; the DVD has a copyright date of 1994, back when DVD's were still a fringe technology.

After I purchased this video sometime in the mid 1990's I have never found another since that could helped me get into shape the way this one did.
I mean everyone noticed after using it 3 times a week for four weeks!

Here it is 2010 and it is still the best by far! You are able to work out at your own level of intensity and still ultimately build strength and stamina. I sometimes restart the beginning warm up incorporating 2-3 lbs weights into the routine before I actually start to step so that I can(step up)the intensity even further. I love the live music and often turn up the speakers getting that feeling of being in the same room. I enjoy feeling the vibrations as I move and step adding to the overall enjoyment of the workout in general! I don't know about anyone else but I feel powerful after this workout too!

With my gym fitness membership My husband and I never really achieved the same level of enthusiasm for getting into shape or even achieved the same level of concentration needed in exercising provided by working out in our own home. And using the Step Reebok 'The video' I can go back later and do the exercises at the end of the video at any time of the day I want to.

Let me just say that I had at least 85 different work out videos and DVDs, I threw out more that half of them. I often go back and forth between other types of workout exercises so that I can change up my routine a bit but always go back to this one and keep it in steady rotation.

Assuming you know some basic step aerobic terminology, you could do this video the first time with your eyes closed if you just listen - she is that good. I was afraid the set would remind me too much of that Karen Voight tape I didn't like, and was also turned off by the 'live drumming'. The set and the drumming turned out to not be overbearing at all. Gin remains silent and cues with her fingers, counting down the steps or pointing right or left. Her verbal cues are delivered via a television set as if she is some entity hovering and instructing above the stepping drones. They are great because they are expressionless and don't say a word. No goofy faces or whooping and calling out. Gin's voice is also pleasant and not perky or peppy, just normal. The routine is very easy to learn and follow. As basic as it gets, yet not too boring.

Anyway, I had to have it again.  I have never seen another step dvd even nearly this good.  The music is excellent, the complexity level, excellent, the video shooting, excellent.

Having gotten to know step aerobics via her ""new"" style, I have a very hard time following her old one as presented in this video.  Her cueing is difficult to follow, doesn't stay on beat, and comes at the last possible second.

The workout itself provides a good level of intensity.  It's too bad that it's so hard to keep up until you have the movements memorized.  I've found _Simply Step_ to provide a similarly good workout with much better cueing.",1210809600,2,558,4.701030927835052

With this DVD you have to fast-forward to even just get to the beginning of the workout as the chapters are not set properly. No nice menu, just a standard DVD-recorder setup. Anybody could have done that. No thought has been put into this. Far tooooo expensive for what it is, even if you pay for the name ""Reebbok"" on the wrapper.

As other reviewers have said Gin Miller's usual bubbly domineer is missing but this isn't the Gin Miller show it's Step Reebok.  I like that the moves are simple and easy to follow however the video is not easy.  It's fun to be able to track just when you run out of gas & have to take a break.  Later you'll definately notice that you can continue and do the whole video without any breaks.

There are so many fad diets out there.  The truth of the matter is if you just exercise & get your heart rate up & do strength training you'll improve the way your body looks.  Shows like 20 minute workout, Margaret Richard's show Body-whatever it was called and Step Reebok were wonderful!  The movements were clear and concise.  I've attempted to do some of the ""new"" workouts and have become completely lost!!!  There is no instruction the instructor jumps in & expects you to hop up & down & over the step while doing salsa!!  I'm not slouch with the footwork but I need to see it slowly at least once before I jump right in & start hopping away.  Step Reebok is not like the new videos.

As for the video, it offers a solid workout (perhaps a bit too many popping steps for those who are heavy or have poor knees, but otherwise very user friendly). All of the steps are explained and the instructors are clearly there to workout, not to chat or joke (you'd be unpleasantly surprised at how many workouts have instructors joking and telling you their lives story). This does work up a major sweat and will burn major fat; especially on the legs and bum. Your bum will look fantastic after a month or two (with a sensible diet, of course!). For beginners, I might recommend the ""CherFitness"" step workout first. It's easier to follow and to get the hang of.

According to the other reviews it is that same routine that has been out on video for years, the DVD cover art kind of confused me, that is not at all what she looks like in the video.

Gin gives lots of warnings before new steps and step changes, as well as lots of instruction. She'll stay with a move long enough to get used to it, then adding small changes at a time. The flow of the workout is very natural and logical. The energizing warm up and stretch before and relaxing cool down and stretch after prevent any injuries without having to do anything but the video. Plus, you can keep doing the same workout even as your physical condition changes: add risers (or however your particular step's height adjusts) as you get in shape, or remove them if it's been a while or if you're tired or have a minor injury. I even added simple wrist weights when I got in really good shape and couldn't add any more risers (there's only so high a 5' 1"" woman can step!). You can even perform the workout with no step if you're really out of shape as I am right now, having just had a beautiful baby girl a few months ago!

Gin Miller is my all time favorite when it comes to stepping, this work out is challenging, you get great results, its not boring like most videos, and she keeps you cued on what to exspect next.

If your wanting a challenging workout, but is easy to follow, this is the one. I don't go to the gym anymore to work out, I just pop in one of Gin Millers step aerobics tapes and I get all the work out I need without the price of those costly gyms.

506077,5,6302749336,"This is my first and still favorite step video.  It is a great beginner workout, with each step slowly being built up from previous moves.  The video teaches you the terminology of step such as ""repeaters"" for 3 successive leg lifts.

So the video wins as a workout.  But it is even more fun because of its music video approach to step.  Most fitness videos have an instructor at the center of a set with several other steppers working out in unison.  There are some camera variations, but the set is fairly static.

This video treats the step class as a music video with an assortment of hardbodies, cool sets, and extensive camera work.  It has an interesting, and never repeated, innovation where the leader's face appears on a TV screen giving instructions, while the real instructor in front of the ""class"" is not speaking.

One of the best parts of this video is the clear cueing.  Gin Miller is one of the best step leaders in the business.  She makes it almost impossible to get lost doing this video.

My only peeve with the video is that they should tell you to turn your step 90-degrees after the second heart-rate check.  The moves at this point in the video work best this way.  Other than that this is a great video.

I'd love to see it remastered as a DVD, but the used video is still a great tool.",1140566400,9,1313,4.4125

506079,4,6302749336,"I agree with the other reviewers as this is a good step video, it is good for beginners as the choreography is very basic and easy to pick up, lots of basic steps, knee lifts, repeaters, etc all with assorted arm movements.  Gin does a good job of cuing as always.  There is also a brief toning section after the step routine.

The setting is dark, and kind of weird, but didn't bother me too much.  There are some drumming musicians which provide the music which fits the routine nicely.  Gin herself is doing the routine along with the background exercisers, but cues with her hands.  There is a TV screen which Gin appears on where she is providing the verbal cues. The dealbreaker for me was the seriousness of the background exercisers, none of them smiled and they appeared almost stern.  It just didn't make the workout fun for me.

Aside from that this is a very good routine, probably one of the best for beginner steppers.  You have very basic moves that are easy to follow and one of the best cuers in the business.  For one that likes basic choreography, I found this one almost ""too basic"", but it kept me in my target heart rate range, which in the end is what matters, you will get a good workout from this video.

7830497,5,6302749336,"I am a fan of The Power Workout, and went looking for other step videos by Gin Miller. This routine is easy to follow but keeps you moving. Great for beginners and seasoned steppers. To add even more intensity, do the workout with 2 lb hand weights in each hand. Extra distraction bonus -- the final video is clearly a cut of repeated routines using the same instructors, so be on the lookout for and count the number of times the instructors switch places (the two behind Gin on the left and the three in the middle column). It's fun!",1517097600,,535,4.36
