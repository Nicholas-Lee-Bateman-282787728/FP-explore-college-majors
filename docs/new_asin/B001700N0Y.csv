He hunts 'em down, hammers 'em, and eats 'em! Simplicity itself! I like the unpolished look and feel of this one. Extremely entertaining in a gruesome way. Also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...",1258848000,,354,5.016949152542373
8264306,5,B001700N0Y,"I disagree with everything written below! I thought the film was a master of kitsch and reminiscent of early John Waters. All it needed was a cameo from ""Divine"". While she was sadly missed, it did have an amazing performance by Jake Wylkie. What a tremendous actor- I'm sure we'll see much of him in the future.
A highly underrated piece of work!",1220572800,,347,4.523809523809524
