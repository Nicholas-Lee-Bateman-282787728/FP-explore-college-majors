8634895,5,B00HRN4MHU,"I am 33 and have never tapped before, but I finally took the plunge and decided that 2018 would be the year I fulfilled my dream of tap dancing.  Rod Howell with United Taps is simply amazing.  I purchased the beginner program (not from Amazon, but from unitedtaps.com), and I simply cant say enough how incredible it has been.  Yes, Im out of shape, and I need to repeat lessons and practice every day, but thats how anyone gets good at anything.  Rod is the very best teacher.  If you want to tap, this is the way to do it!",1521936000,,525,4.21

Considering, I've never tapped before, I learned a lot watching and tapping with, Beginner Tap Dance Lessons by Rod Howell, back in July 2014.

To folks interested in tap, I definitely recommend these lessons.

Rod Howell is an excellent instructor, patient and funny.
Lesson 1 starts with basic steps, but steps required to further faster and more experienced combinations/dance lessons.

12 DVD's are included. Lesson 1-12. Each lesson progresses the dancer's techniques.",1423180800,,492,5.447368421052632
