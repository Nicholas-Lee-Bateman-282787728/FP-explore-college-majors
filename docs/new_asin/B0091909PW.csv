I'm a big fan of shorts and also a fan of horror so I really enjoyed this little gem from Billie Brannock. The great thing about an Indie is no studio was telling them more blood or sex to sell. This little story takes you back to the days of Twilight Zone and Night Gallery when it was all about character development and atmosphere to set up a creepy little story about a guy who thinks he can get away with anything.  Pricey for the length, yes, but a spider web full of fun.",1347667200,,560,4.185185185185185
