2414569,5,B000BDH6AI,"Finally, the best season of NEWLYWEDS is on its way! After the first season i thought the show had hit it's peak because the second and third season weren't that great! But i think this season showed a new side of both nick and jessica. We got to see jessica film THE DUKES OF HAZZARD (and check her out in THOSE shorts) and nick without jessica. Although the finale was SOOOOOO SET UP it's unbelievably unbelievable, it was great to re-cap the entire series! Enjoyable, funny, NOT DISAPPOINTING! Buy it!

THe end of hearing these people crassly talk about what comes out both ends of them and their noses, not mention their dogs and whatever creature shows up and uses the bathroom in their yard. The only difference in this season and the others were 1) it is shorter and 2) all the hangers on (cacee, mom, dad, drew and his rude wife, etc) are MIA. Just more inane episodes watching them buy groceries, eat, eat some more, being chauffeured around, spend money that grows on trees in their back yards evidently, etc. For the record Jessica simpson and nick lachey must have tapeworms because I have never seen two people eat so much food (and junk fast food) ALL THE TIME and never gain a pound and be so fit.",1416268800,,723,4.402985074626866

2414605,3,B000BDH6AI,"I really enjoyed this show, and had the first 3 seasons on dvd before I knew this one existed. I ordered it and while I still love the show, the last season it seamed as though they were just going through the motions of being married, and you could tell there were some serious problems in the relationship. Its too bad, because you could tell they really were in love when they first got married, but then it all fell apart. Marriage is difficult, but I'm sure its harder when the whole world can watch your relationship being plastered across the media and TV.  That has to put a damper on the relationship, as well as all of the time spent apart. Its a shame it didn't work out for them.",1402963200,,691,4.2748091603053435

2414609,5,B000BDH6AI,"What a great little reality show. I love this show and I sometimes grave the DVDs and watch the whole series.

This one is a little shorter, in my opinion, or at least it feels that way. But in this season, Jessica is already a well known super star and is a big difference from her fame from the first season. Jessica now is enjoying the luxuries of VIP pop star. She films a movie and is pretty much getting endorsement deals left and right.

I think Nick is trying to keep up but you can tell that he's not getting half the amount of job opportunities that Jessica is.",1376697600,,571,4.181818181818182

2414632,2,B000BDH6AI,"I half paid attention to this while I watched it. This season lacks good drama and often strays away from attracted people to the show in the first place - watching interaction of Jessica and Nick. You will spend an entire episode watching Nick fooling around with his friends on a boat in Mexico. i don't even remember where Jessica was, but it wasn't interesting either. I liked the other seasons better.",1283126400,,406,4.652777777777778
2414633,5,B000BDH6AI,"I love Jessica Simpson ... because of who she is. She has a great down to earth normal personality, she's not stuck up and she appears to be a great friend to those around her. I don't think she should have allowed her best friend (assistant) Casey to move in with them, it made things even worse. They needed their privacy and they didn't have that with her their 24/7. I can't remember which season but on one of the episodes when they dress up for halloween like the Three's Company crew ... notice how toward the end when they are all walking out the door Casey is the last one to walk out and Nick is holding the door open ... she touches his stomach in a really flirtatious way ... i hated her ... Jessica never realized that all the tension between Nick and Casey was because they liked eachother, which is why Nick sort of argued with her sometimes. Made me sick !",1208908800,,872,4.259036144578313

2414635,1,B000BDH6AI,"Throughout this entire season, all Nick and Jessica did was argue.  He was a jerk to her about the littlest things and she nagged him about the things that she never complained about before.  Watching this season only made it more apparent that their marriage was in trouble.  I think about two months after I watched it, Jessica asked for a divorce.  This season must have been just thrown together to create an ""end"" to the series.  It didn't just end the series, but their marriage as well.  What a waste!",1186272000,2,508,4.527472527472527
2414636,4,B000BDH6AI,"Whether you admit it or not, we fell in love with Nick and Jessica.  If you watched every episode as it aired or missed a few, you'll love this DVD.",1156550400,2,148,3.933333333333333
2414637,5,B000BDH6AI,"Musically, I am a huge Nick Lachey fan.  I loved the show and hope that he has great success with his solo career.",1152316800,2,114,3.9565217391304346
2414638,3,B000BDH6AI,"Jessica Simpson started out as the most believable and refreshing of the teen queens in late 1999 with her semi-sweet debut Sweet Kisses.  Sadly, though, her career didn't have much momentum...until 2003's PR-ready MTV Newlyweds show that truly propelled her to insta-stardom.  Soon after she received Britney Spears popularity status, but last December decided, shockingly, to divorce first love and Newlyweds co-star Nick Lachey.  Overall, the final season of Newlyweds is a 4-star release because, although it does have its moments, it's not horrible, but it ain't good either...but Jessica Simpson is no longer known for her so-called ""talent"" (something she possessed first, but lacks vocally now--I mean, can you say ""off key""?!) but for her party-heavy celebrity antics.  Simpson has become an annoying tabloid queen for becoming famous for something she no longer is: married.  Too bad, too, because she had potential.",1140048000,5,926,5.4475524475524475
2414639,5,B000BDH6AI,I purchased the 2&3rd seasons and I purchased this one and I love them!! All the episodes are really funny and there is a lot of bonus material! I highly reccommend this and all other Newlyweds dvds!,1138492800,3,199,4.405405405405405
2414640,4,B000BDH6AI,"I thought this last release was quite bitter sweet, as we know what happened to the NewlyWeds,and it wasn't ""happily ever after"". Not as enjoyable as the first 3 seasons, but if you are a fan of the show (as I am) you will still find it entertaining. I had to chuckle when, on Valentine's Day, Jessica told Nick (sitting in a restaurant with the cardboard heart she had made for him) : ""here you are still sitting with your heart on"". Wasnt that the problem - he always had a heart on but she wasn't always in the mood for it? :-)",1137628800,6,530,4.155339805825243
2414650,3,B000BDH6AI,"So my wife has gotten me all wrapped up in the Newlywed buzz. The divorce is a tragedy, ok I'm over it. However my most favorite ""Simpson"" moment from the final season didn't come from Jessica, it came from Ashlee. After seeing her exposed for the fraud she is on SNL, I couldn't get enough of people making fun of her...""Yeah, my sister is famous and even though I have absolutely NO TALENT, please sign me to a record deal."" Enter Joe Simpson, father to Jessica and Ashlee and producer of The Newlyweds.

Anyway, in the spirit of making of fun of Ashlee, you could easily imagine my glee when the ""Orange Bowl"" episode was aired when the show was on TV. As I'm sure many of you remember, Ashlee appeared during the halftime show and was absolutely AWFUL, leaving the stage to an overwhelming volume of BOOOOOO from her ""fans."" Wake up!!!!! You're not good!!! Instead of her band blowing it like on SNL, she blamed her earpiece. To blame it on anyone but yourself is shameful, as if in the first instance, it was your band's fault that you can't sing...""Daddy, I really screwed up, I'm a fake, what should I do??""...""Why Ashlee, blame the band!"" Real Nice. But the look on her face when the booo's started was priceless, she was petrified!!

I digress, back to Newlyweds. My wife and I watched that episode last night with much anticipation...but what's this...the entire segment of Ashlee getting boooed has been CUT from the episode. MY GOD in HEAVEN. Joe Simpson has struck again! One problem, we all remember. You may have erased the dvd, but the memory lingers, I laugh whenever I think about it. And realizing how pathetic it is to erase it makes me laugh even harder. Do yourself a favor and stop making Ashlee records so she can live life with some dignity. You can't manufacture good music from untalented people and expect it to last.

Overall, the DVD is funny with some sweet moments, but it looks like they need to release an ""uncensored by Joe"" version.",1137628800,13,1968,4.569405099150142
2414651,3,B000BDH6AI,"If you pay attention during these 10 episodes you can clearly see the end coming for our favorite Newlyweds. That spark of love and affection is gone and Nick & Jessica seem to be going through the motions. They spend more time apart and Nick ALWAYS seems annoyed! I guess Jessica isn't so cute after 2 years of marriage.

I don't know, maybe it was all the media coverage or maybe it was Daisy the dog or maybe Nick & Jessica just grew apart, in any event they are OVER and even though at first I thought it was hysterical that they were getting divorced, after watching the ""Newlyweds - Nick & Jessica"" DVDs I do think it's sad. I will miss the show and I will miss rolling my eyes at Jessica's ditziness.

These DVDs are a must have for all Nick & Jessica fans. Let's face it, alot of us didn't really know who Nick & Jessica were until this show aired on MTV!",1137369600,11,863,4.192771084337349
2414652,3,B000BDH6AI,"I grew up in junior high in the midst of the chaotic, often repeatable business of the revived Teen Pop music.  Of course, being a typical adolescent, I enjoyed the fresh, disposable genre--especially since I had a fondness toward prime revivalist and hottie Britney Spears.  But I knew who Jessica Simpson in the end of 2000, a year after her tepid debut Sweet Kisses hit shelves, and enjoyed her music--sure, she didn't come off nearly as irresistible as Britney, but she was hot, blonde and had some decent songs (none of which were as good as ""...Baby One More Time"").  Then, in 2003, at age 18 I first heard about the highly entertaining and hugely publicized Chicken of the Sea ""incident"" from her and new hubby Nick Lachey's hit-MTV reality show Newlyweds.  Of course, this is what actually made the two B-listers become as famous on the scale of Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, but intrigued by how ridiculous the ""So is this chicken or fish?"" comment everyone seemed to be bubbling about, I decided to see a show.  I enjoyed it a lot--mainly because Jessica Simpson didn't put on some show of being a high maintenance superstar (since, at the time of the taping, she hadn't achieved that success yet).  I became a kind of closet Newlyweds fan and even purchased every season on DVD.  But then, last November, I heard the couple had actually split; not only did the release of the final season here seem unbelievable, it completely didn't help that the couple that became famous for a show should put out a DVD compilation of their final moments when they were still together.  Sure, it had its enjoyable moments (though far and few, and even less ridiculous as the Chicken of the Sea comment), but the fact that you knew both stars had separated quenched the overall enjoyment.  It's kind of sad that Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey achieved true A-list status but lost their cherished marriage (obviously, as seen in previous episodes, these two are/were in love) because of the show that made them famous.  It's also sad because Jessica Simpson seems to be on a spiral amidst the media frenzy when, a year ago, she was on top of the world and rivaling pop super-superstar Britney Spears.  Newlyweds: The Final Season is good, but somehow their pending divorce makes it less than stellar.  I guess Simpson's boots really were made for walkin'. ~Chris Eberlein",1136851200,9,2375,4.765853658536585
2414653,3,B000BDH6AI,"It's painful to watch the final season of the show, as the DVD was released just after Jessica Simpson filed for divorce. Just watch the episodes surrounding New Year's 2005 and Valentine's Day. Both Jessica and Nick make big pronouncements as to their love for one another early in the New Year...so what happened?

It's hard not to be a cynic regarding their marriage. The tabloids have been at it all year long, almost seeming to salivate at the prospect of their spliting up. Why give them the satisfaction? Stick out your marriage. It's worth it. Prove the skeptics wrong! Unless, of course, the marriage was all a sham to begin with, a publicity stunt for a ""reality TV show"" meant to propel them into super-stardom. Well, it worked. Jessica leapfrogged over Britney in terms of popularity, fame, and money.

The one episode that makes me most skeptical of the show is the final one where they pack up the house to move. The way Nick and Jessica went through their things and offered, ""remember when"" moments to each other seemed very contrived, as though they were acting for a final nostalgia show to end the series. When it turns out that they weren't really moving out of the house, that was the clincher. They faked the series ending for the sake of the show (to close it with an appropriate end).

With their first 2 years of marriage on dvd, nicely edited, it would have been a great gift to their future, unborn children...as who wouldn't want to see what their parents were like as newlyweds? Honestly, I am a bit heartbroken for the two of them...as they seem very good together. Why give up on marriage now? Work out your problems for the sake of the relationship. Maybe they might reconsider and reconcile, or maybe the breakup is real. Whatever the case, I'm sure this show will prove an embarrassment to both of them in the future when they find new loves and relationships outside of camera range. What will both of their significant others think of this DVD existing forever as a testiment to another failed Hollywood relationship? What does it all mean?

Well, Jessica, I love hearing you say ""Nick"" all the time. If you're looking for another Nick who will love and cherish you, I'm available! You're cute, funny, and your statements that others take as a sign of stupidity, I find endearing. So, what do you say, huh?",1135900800,,2342,4.64975845410628
2414654,3,B000BDH6AI,"I used to respect Jessica Simpson even though I found Britney Spears to be the scorcher of all the female pop stars of the late 90s.  Her fresh personality, even if a bit ditzy at times a la Newlyweds, and burgeoning charisma drew me to her even though her music had little to be desired.  But I can't respect somebody who just absentmindedly decides to divorce someone she was obviously (check the first season of MTV's Newlyweds) in love with.  C'mon!  Aren't we rushing into things a little too fast, J?  Take some time apart, but don't divorce.  That said, the final season of the hit show that made Simpson and her hubby Nick Lachey first super-famous is tepid and odd now that they are talking divorce; somehow it doesn't pack the irresistible punch it had when they were married, and I think that could hurt Jessica's career.  First of all, they should've stopped after the first season because it's probable their reality TV show, brought on by the sudden boom in popularity, led to their maritial problems.  Jessica Simpson of ALL people, with her Christian upbringing, should see that divorce isn't just something you should do if you two get in a spat!  Now I can understand their need to be as famous as Britney or Justin, but c'mon!  One season was enough--you finally got really famous, for your blonde jokes, and now you achieved that.  Newlyweds: The Final Season has its share of Jessica moments, though fewer than previous seasons, and although decent, it remains lackluster in the fact the ""newlyweds"" are divorcing.  C'mon, you two...GROW UP.",1135296000,5,1562,4.765799256505576
2414655,1,B000BDH6AI,"While I loved Newlyweds, I just can't stand to watch it now knowing what's going on right now with Nick and Jessica.  Jessica has filed for divorce!!! Hello!!  What a crappy time to put out another DVD.  I had the other 2 DVD sets which I eventually sold and I'm glad I did.  This show was supposed to give viewers a taste of what it's like to be married and while it did that, wouldn't it also get you thinking, ""So, all marriages evetually end in divorce..."" hmm",1135123200,5,464,4.238636363636363
2414656,3,B000BDH6AI,"I always enjoyed Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey as a couple.  Sure, their hit reality TV made them true stars in 2003, but there was always something inviting and uninhibited brought by the two singers, most especially seen in Jessica Simpson.  It's sad to think that at the time of this DVD's release they had experienced a separation that's led to filing for divorce because in the first season it was obvious the two had definite affection for each other and were truly in love.  I believe they both need to go to marriage counseling since it was Newlyweds that probably led to their separation due to the sudden boom in popularity and demand because I think Nick and Jessica could get over their career anxiety.  The blonde moments Simpson has become famous for are here, though fewer and less ridiculous than the infamous Chicken of the Sea tuna comment, and it's apparent from the opening episode that the bickering is getting more heated.  Still, it's an entertaining show, though it lacks the pizzazz it'd have had the couple continued doing what their show Newlyweds was really about: being married.",1134950400,8,1109,4.815789473684211
2414657,1,B000BDH6AI,"I enjoyed the first season of NEWLYWEDS ... in a watching-a-trainwreck sort of way.

Then Jess & Nick started to get more famous ... and then her CreepyPa started making comments about her bod ... and then they were everywhere ... and then they became just overexposed and ANNOYING!

That said, it pained me that after completing the first (cute) season of their show, they felt the need to sell out on their marriage so more. It saddened me to watch their marriage fall apart on screen, and for both people to just become so trashy and hateful. Both Nick and Jessica are a waste of space and you could see their divorce coming from a mile away. Watching their later seasons just put a pit in my stomach because I couldn't believe that people would treat a marriage with so little respect.

This DVD is worth it if you feel like a.) laughing over these losers' losing marriage and making a drinking game out of spotting the ""soon-to-be-divorced"" moments (i.e. when he rolls his eyes or yells at her, etc.) It's also good for b.) using as a manual for real newlyweds on how NOT to act during a marriage. And once you're done with that, it always makes a good coaster. :)

Here's hoping these two famewhores (and Ashlee too) will disappear.

To put it into language Jessica will understand: Sneeble, snarble, snoo! Burbuly boo burbuly boo zim zam wammy jam woo woo woo burbuly boo burbuly boo splippity splappity sploo sploo sploo zing zang beeble bibble bop!",1134691200,7,1457,4.588461538461538
2414658,3,B000BDH6AI,"I'd always liked Nick and Jessica as a couple.  I enjoyed seeing them mature together on Newlyweds.  The problem is the final season is bittersweet due to the fact that Nick and Jessica have now split (NOT divorced), so this DVD does not seem as great as it could've been if they'd stayed together.  It's noticeable in fact the newlyweds are having marital problems because they argue more than usual, especially in the beginning of the opening episode.  Still, the blonde moments that first made the show a surefire hit are here.  Good show, but somehow the fact they've split takes most of the charm.",1134432000,5,602,4.695238095238095
2414659,3,B000BDH6AI,"I was hoping that Season 3 would be a great finale after the average Seasons 2 and 3. I had always liked Jessica and Nick before Newlyweds, and thought Season 1 was fab.

This is why I was so looking forward to the Finale - I felt like we'd been on the journey with the couple and it was the end of the road.

So when the box set came I was hoping for the spirit of Season 1 to reform and fill me with excitment like at the begining....

However...I was to be dissapointed.

Its very clear that Nick and Jess were spending more and more time apart - that things were cooling between them.  I was dissapointed for one of the main reasons I loved newlyweds was because of the romance and mushy stuff between them.

I also had in the back of my mind that this couple had now split - a little under 12 months since the finale was filmed.

To be honest, i feel a little bit conned as a consumer, I feel like i've bought the books and the various DVDs and now they've made their money and fame there chucking the towell in.

If your a fan and already own the previous seasons, do buy. if not, its not worth it - particulary as they have now split.",1134172800,8,1141,4.04

I feel jessica is way to immature for a serious relationship let alone marriage. Being a star has nothing to do with their marriage problems. she spends too much money or useless worthless junk and he spends to much time with his friends!! iam only saying this because like all of you I LOVE THE NEWLYWEDS SERIES and instead of buying it this time, i rented it from netflix because of the price for only a 2 disc series finale. I feel ripped off and they both should seriously consider some help. AND MUCH NEEDED TIME AWAY FROM THE PARENTS OF JESSICA SIMPSON!! that man dictates every move this girl makes and THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM!! I personally ""DO NOT"" LIKE  THE man and don't even know him. what a sad feeling for me. i will meanwhile always cherish the newlyweds as they once were! and besides NICK HAS NO BUSINESS OUT WITH A BUNCH OF WOMEN SURROUNDING HIM!!he has an EGO problem to boot!",1134000000,2,1024,4.389473684210526
2414662,3,B000BDH6AI,"What a waste of money.  I own all the seasons of the newlyweds and this final one has two episodes that are from season 3, I can't believe I wasted my money.  Even the special extras are the exact same.  I am definately not impressed with this.  It was like the directors were trying to resell and I can't believe it's legal to charge this much for something they sold as season 3.",1133913600,9,381,4.178082191780822
2414663,4,B000BDH6AI,I own all the Newleywes! First off this season shows the couple not so lovey duvey and they actually spend time apart. It's quite sad this hollywood couple split up they would've made really cute kids together. I would've liked this couple to stay together really how hard is it to stay together?! I have been married to my husband 11 years and we dated 5 before we got married. But oh well life goes on I guess the saying is true money can't buy happiness huh!?,1133913600,2,462,4.32183908045977
2414664,5,B000BDH6AI,this is the final season of newlyweds and its a sad goodbye. to nick and jessica. i loved them together and i own all the rest of the seasons. so if u guys never had a chance to see this series get on board and buy the intire series.,1133827200,,233,3.7755102040816326

2414667,3,B000BDH6AI,"The show was funny, but obviously the marriage is over. Was it all a setup? If yes, celebrities are really pushing it. Our kids watch this junk and what are they learning? Lachey seems more down to earth than Jessica, anyway, but come on. Can't people get enough funnies out of their own lives rather than having to pay $18.97 for it. Get real. Celebs should not be allowed to be married. Tom Cruise is a great example. He's crazy too.",1133222400,3,435,4.382716049382716

How do you know I'm not jessica, nick, or ashlee! I also could be cacee! I could be lea. People are so mean aren't they! How fine is drew? He is looking real good these days! Good luck on ""dancing with the stars"". I know jess & nick love all their fans! Stick by them! They love ya! GOD BLESS YOU ALL! SMOOCHES!!!!!!!!!!! S. O. S.",1132963200,,657,4.349593495934959
