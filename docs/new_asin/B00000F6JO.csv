7907372,5,B00000F6JO,"It's not often a playwright gets to direct the film of his own play so Jason Miller's production of the Pultizer Prize winner, which took 10 years to reach the screen, brings great expectations. Miller seems to have opted to concentrate on the performances of his 5 principle players, as opposed to trying for any visual style, which is appropriate for this kind of ensemble Eugene O'Neill-ish drama. The stage origins of the material are still in evidence, by having the actors constantly moving from room to room but this hardly matters when the actors engender such good will. The set-up is the reunion of the 1957 high school state basketball champions of Scranton, Pennsylvania, at a time when Bruce Dern's Mayor is up for re-election. Thankfully the life as sport metaphor isn't pushed too much, and the coach that the four men all worship isn't revealed to be a phony. You may wonder why these grown men still seek the juvenile approval of a schoolboy teacher, but the reason is in the way he understands them, knows how to sooth their anguish, and still inspire them. He is a father who is both wise and loving. The deep-voiced Robert Mitchum brings both his strong masculinity and a delicate empathy to the character. His coach doesn't need to swear or raise his voice. Just the laying on hands is enough, though his rejection of one of the men as a ploy strikes a false note, perhaps since this is the only time we see Mitchum reduced to phyisical violence. Perhaps I was also put off from this moment since the rejection follows the Edward Albee-ish mention of the player who has refused to reunite. The play's narrative doesn't cover any new ground but it does allow actors like Dern, Stacy Keach, and in particular Paul Sorvino and Martin Sheen to have richer and longer screen exposure. Sorvino is a revelation, perhaps explaining why he instigated a remake, and Sheen very funny, especially when he laughs. Of note is the quiet side to Bill Conti's score.",970617600,3,1970,4.71304347826087
