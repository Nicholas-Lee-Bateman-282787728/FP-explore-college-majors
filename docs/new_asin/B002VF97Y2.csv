8611542,4,B002VF97Y2,"This DVD arrived quickly. There are a wide variety of movies referenced on it. They range from ""Bride of Gorilla"" to ""Casablanca"" and the silent classic ""Birth of a Nation."" It's really fun to recognize actors & see them in roles outside their usual characters -- roles some would like to forget from their early films, no doubt. My only complainta are that some of them end very abruptly and the audio loudness is not consistent from one trailer to the next. But for my use as a background prop for a party, it's just fine.",1266192000,,524,4.46875
