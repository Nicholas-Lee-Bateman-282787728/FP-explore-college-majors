This video was one of the childhood staples that I would watch on an endless loop. Yeah it doesn't spend much time on the beginnings of the game, but was there really all that much footage to show? I love the part about the Oakland Raiders, it did a great job showing the history and the lore of the game from the AFL & NFL merger onward. This video got me into the NFL films which became a daily habit of mine once the weather toured cold in New England.

While baseball  gets the Ken Burns treatment, with a proper multi-volume approach, NFL fans  are stuck with this. NFL Films generally does good work, but not here.",954460800,5,443,5.391304347826087
