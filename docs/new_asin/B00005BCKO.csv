7937215,5,B00005BCKO,"Another excellent volume of one of the best animated series ever.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

18.  Sandstorm:  The Alliance travels to planet Sand. Lady Zera meets one of the Sand People, Zuma, who turns out to be a telepath.  A+

19.  Girls' Night Out:  Jade, princess Tekla, Lady Zera, Pelvus and Zuma head for ""Moon Over Mayhem"" to socialize.  A

20.  Time Bomb:  The Alliance finds Planet Jungle.  They are willing to sacrifice this non-living world to trap the Beast Planet and Blokk's forces. On a trip to planet Jungle they place explosives but living plants ask for their help.  An excellent episode.  By the way, does anyone else think Planet Jungle resembles a certain planet seen in Beast Machines?  It serves to help fuel a Wild Mass Guess that the Beast Planet is actually Unicron from Transformers.  A+

21.  Embers of the Past:  The Alliance is surprised when Planet Fire catches up to them.  Apparently the Grand Vizier is alive but his personality seems different.  A

Again, get this if you can.  Even if you have to make some effort to find it, it's worth it.",1388016000,,1117,4.668393782383419

The story follows the adventures of the inhabitants of warring worlds that must come together to battle a common foe set on destroying them all. Honor, sacrifice and co-operation are regular themes of the series intermingled with deceit and deception.

Myself and my 7 year-old daughter really enjoy the action-packed episodes and the great character development. I have a state-of-the-art HD home theater set-up and these disks translate wonderfully to the big screen. The excellent sound quality is the icing on the cake.

Obviously, I give this series my highest recommendation.",1360368000,,728,5.3130434782608695
7937217,4,B00005BCKO,"While it was some time ago when I purchased this series, Amazon ask me to rate it now; go figure. It is a good story. Buyer be warned, you will have to make 5 separate purchases in order to watch the entire series but it is worth the investment in my opinion. I honestly cannot rate the service or seller themselves because it has been too long since the purchase (over 5 yrs.). At the time, I had to find some of them on other website in order to complete the series but that is how much I enjoyed. I had watch it first though a rental service, my children and I both like it so it is something both children and adults will enjoy. So I began the search. My only real complaint would be how the jacket covers themselves do not distinctquish 1-5. You can easily find them through the title but once you own and go to watch them at a later date, you do not remember which is which, you have to insert the disc to figure it out and even that ;may not help if you do not remember the order of play. I highly recommend using masking tape to note the order inside the case or on the outside with tape or a sharpie maker.",1359936000,,1115,4.049773755656108

7937219,5,B00005BCKO,"This is one of the BEST animated sci-fi series you will ever have the pleasure of viewing . The animation alone is astounding, but couple that with a storyline that is amazingly well written, and character developement that goes even deeper than some well known sci-fi classics, and you have the most well done , if also least known , series ever produced ! The entire series is definitely; an overlooked treasure! Get it, and prepare to be entertained beyond animation!",1268092800,,470,4.814814814814815
7937220,5,B00005BCKO,"This entire series was done with such an attention to detail, not only in the animation but with the story writing as well.  Peddled as a kiddie show it wasn't really, then of course almost all of the products that Mainframe Entertainment put out are geared more towards the discerning adult lover of animation than little Jimmy age 7.  With the vhs video you get to relive the wonderful exploits and adventures of some of the most epic science fiction around.  Mainframe Entertainment really outdid themselves when they put together this wonderful series.  I usually don't go into details when I review things because I want people to make up their own minds, but in this case, the interactions of the characters are so great that I cant help but signal some out.  Femur and Jade have a rivalry that is beyond funny, he will always be the ultimate slippery toad and she is forever going to be the rock hard, unbending soldier.  Perfect in their roles, they have some of the best lines in the whole show.  Buy this video and the others of the series you won't regret a moment of it.",1006560000,5,1082,4.546391752577319
