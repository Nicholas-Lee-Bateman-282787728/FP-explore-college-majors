8200481,5,B000RG1HHW,"I have something of a morbid curiosity that developed into a fetish for industrial disaster documentaries. If you are similarly afflicted, this tells a very riveting and frightening tale of the criminal negligence of W.R. Grace Co. that destroyed a beautiful town in the shadow of a vermiculite mine...",1402358400,,302,5.183673469387755

8200483,5,B000RG1HHW,The poor residents of Libby were lied to and denied knowledge of their working conditions. W. R. Grace what a corporation...,1392422400,,124,4.9523809523809526
8200484,3,B000RG1HHW,"For many years, W.R. Grace Corporation operated an asbestos mine in Libby, Montana, and the mine dominated the small town's economy. By 1956 Grace realized that workers at the mine were inhaling lethal asbestos fibers. Grace did nothing and closed the mine in 1990. However, the workers and Libby have paid the price.

The documentary ""Libby, Montana"" tells the story. The two-hour film is interesting, but it is very uneven.

The first hour is great. The filmmakers focus on Libby and its people. Viewers get an idea of what life is like in Libby and gain an appreciation for the tough people who live there. There are some gorgeous shots of the Rocky Mountains and of the town. Also, the film reviews the history of WR Grace in Libby.

Unfortunately, the film runs off the tracks in the second hour. The filmmakers focus on the government's response to the problems at Libby. It's an interesting idea, but the viewer sits through endless civic forums, EPA staff meetings, etc. It is like watching a dull hearing on C-SPAN. The filmmakers should have edited the last hour down to about 15 minutes.

Libby, Montana, is worth watching, but it rates no higher than three stars.",1280361600,2,1175,4.773399014778325
8200485,5,B000RG1HHW,"Saw this on local PBS station.  Was thorouly appalled with the total disregard for safety for the workers.  W.R. Grace had absolutly no plans for the health and safety of the workers. Just a constant, neverending strive for the almighty dollar....No matter what the cost!  Another sad example of the sickening state of the corporate system in this country!!!",1188345600,8,358,5.033898305084746
