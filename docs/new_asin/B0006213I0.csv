8036650,4,B0006213I0,"We used it for our family reunion.  One of our ancestors was on the boat with George Washington as they crossed the waters to Trenton.  It was fun to show all of our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.",1502496000,,214,4.605263157894737
8036651,4,B0006213I0,I enjoyed this show as a kid.  Cute 25 minute presentations of historical fact presented as drama.  Also a look at old-style tv.,1444521600,,128,4.521739130434782
8036652,5,B0006213I0,I chose this rating because my dad loved it!  We were talking about old tv shows and he and I both remembered this series so I went on a hunt for it.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves or is interested in history!  Great dvd!  He watched this and another You Are There (both Christmas gifts) and loved them both!,1388102400,,321,4.129032258064516
8036653,4,B0006213I0,I had trouble playing this on my dvd player and it won't go at all on my comp. I have a newer dvd player I'm going to try next...Hope it works because from what I was able to watch it is just what I needed.,1357171200,,206,3.6
8036654,4,B0006213I0,"You Are There is simply an unsurpassed way of getting a capsule review of historic events.  It arouses interest and provides incentive to dwelve more deeply into specific events throughout history.  I would very much like to see a release of the entire series.  There are more of these individual DVD's available for those that wish.  The quality of this disc is quite good and the shows are complete.  However, I can't in good conscience acquire any more because I refuse to support any series where they inject a watermark during the program.  There's just no way that could have originally been there.  If not for that marring, this would have been 5 stars.",1247875200,,660,4.7368421052631575
8036655,4,B0006213I0,"I've reviewed another of this series elsewhere (Capture of John Wilkes Booth and Spindletop), and I find this one equally valuable but, again, not necessarily for younger kids.

The program production values are not up to the expectations of modern viewers, particularly children, as the single-shot scenes are often long with much talking by characters.  Furthermore, many kids are immediately turned off by black-and-white images.

Nevertheless, the concept and presentation is sound, and the information is excellent.

And at the relatively inexpensive price, it's worth getting if you're interested in George Washington and his era.",1238716800,,636,5.663157894736842
8036656,4,B0006213I0,"I have been waiting for this series to be released and I must say I am not disappointed!  Walter Cronkite and his news staff deliver great coverage of historic events ""as they happen.""  Great stuff for children wanting to know about history.  I am planning to use them in my classroom.",1104364800,10,285,4.549019607843137
