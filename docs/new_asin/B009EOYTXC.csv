8540643,4,B009EOYTXC,"Easy to select for English, only needs region-free DVD player (which I had) in order to play. It's very nice to have the whole series! I've never been able to follow all of its serialized events on television and was a bit confused at times as to how things happened. Great nostalgia/comfort watching. The picture quality is not the best but that's just the time in which it was made, it's only going to get so good from that era. It looks like it did on TV then.",1494892800,,463,4.2727272727272725

8540646,3,B009EOYTXC,"Pay attention to the label!! The series is formatted in German. If you have a DVD player that can play European format, you will be alright! Although, getting it to run an English can be challenging, and has all of the labeling on the screen is in German!
Otherwise, it is just as funny as I remember from watching it with my mom!!",1464566400,2,331,4.26984126984127
8540647,5,B009EOYTXC,"Cybill is a great series staring Cybil Sheperd as Cybill Sheridan, an aging actress still struggling to make it in Hollywood.  It is refreshing to watch a television show that is well written and well acted. And though the show is clearly Cybill Shepherd's vehicle, she did not dominate it, allowing other actors such as Christine Baranski who played best friend, Mary Ann to shine. This is severely missing in  today's world of reality television.  Thank you, Cybill with a "" C.""",1463443200,3,480,4.829268292682927

I liked Cybill Shepherd.  She has a nice television presence, but she was clearly upstaged.

Christine Baranski/Maryann Thorpe is a star.  Such shallow words considering her accomplishments, but the show was the first time I had ever seen her on television.  She stole every scene, and she was astounding every time she guest-starred in other television series.  She was eloquent and elegant, and she knew exactly how to act.  She knew how to assimulate in every show, which explains her longevity.  It was clear she was trying to mollify Cybill Shepherd, but her talent could not be resisted, because her talent was so profound.

You get younger daughter, Zoe Woodbine/Alicia Witt who had this unusual beauty - stark red hair and pale skin, and she was constantly playing the piano, and Dedee Pfeiffer/Rachel Robbins Manning, Michelle Pfeiffer's little sister,  played the older sister, who seemed lesser loved.

Per the script of the show, Cybill Sheridan/Cybill Sheridan was this aging actress still attempting to find stardom.  It made her likable, and you get a bit of her concern.  But this is by no means a perfect series.

I belief strife more than ratings contributed to this series ruin.  Too bad.  The show could have been great.",1436572800,3,1362,4.907894736842105
