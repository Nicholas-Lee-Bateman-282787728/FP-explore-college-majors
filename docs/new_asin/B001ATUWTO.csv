They sit and literally watch TV.  I still do not like leaving them alone the amount of time I need to for work, but this DVD has truly made leaving them alone easier.",1384300800,3,311,4.166666666666667
8279666,4,B001ATUWTO,It was pretty good!  My Maltese-Terrier seemed to find it relaxing and enjoyable.  I usually put it in the DVD player once a week.,1383436800,2,130,4.375
8279667,3,B001ATUWTO,My puppy doesn't really watch it. But at least when I turn it on he knows I'm leaving. I don't know if that's a good thing or not,1361491200,,129,3.642857142857143

8279669,5,B001ATUWTO,"I have purchased just about every dog video out there available on Amazon and this one is one of her favorites. I can definitely tell she much prefers the videos over the radio when left alone, and althoughs he no longer intently stares at the TV like she did when I first turned on the video I can see her watching the screen from her couch.

This video is well shot and looks much more profeesional than some of the other videos out there. It's not solely dogs over and over, but skips around to other animals as well. (for some, that's a plus. For others, it's not. Depends on your dog.) For me, it's neither here nor there.

On the down side, some of the videos out there load up on sounds of dogs barking and whining, and it's difficult to fathom why you would want to leave a video like that playing while you leave the house. I can't stand listening to the video for five minutes myself; I can't imagine having to listen to it over and over for hours on end while I'm at work!

While this video does have a little of that, it's not bad at all and not over powering.

 I did find that she seems to ""whine"" when she sees the horses on this video for some reason, but it's not loud and quite cute!

I have other videos that are *too* quiet, some that feature music instead of side effects, and others that are in-between. (Not too silent, not too much barking) I think this video typically fits into the ""nice modicum"" cateogry.",1317254400,10,1432,4.2463235294117645
