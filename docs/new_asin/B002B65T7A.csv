3892915,5,B002B65T7A,"This movie is beyond beautiful.  Ray's films always get the tear ducts working, but with this one the valves seemed to have been blasted open.  Such a beautiful picture. Anyone who's been to India or has a feeling for the religion will find much to wonder at here.  It's amazing how close to the bone Ray's pictures go in serving up portraits of India.",1279411200,2,352,4.46875
3892916,4,B002B65T7A,"Satyajit Ray shows an inner struggle between traditional and modern values in Indian life,urban and rural. Devi(The Goddess 1960) explores the dangers of religious fanaticism and superstition. We see Kali,the Hindu deity,whose statue is adorned and carried in a religious festival,fireworks and her being cast adrift from the river bank. Uma(Chatterji) will resume his university studies in Calcutta leaving his shy,beautiful wife Doya(Tagore)apprehensive about the prolonged separation. He asks her to write daily,declaring his studies useful for a better job,and the ennoblement of knowledge. This is mid-19th century Bengal.

Doya dotes on her nephew Kohka and attends to the needs of her wealthy father-in-law Roy(Biswas),who calls her ""mother"" as a term of endearment. Roy has a dream that Doya is the reincarnation of goddess Kali. She,fearful of displeasing her father-in-law's delusion, is manipulated and transformed into the image of Kali. Roy's revelation is disseminated throughout the village,the gullible Doya accepts the worship of the people around her as they pay homage or seek assistance from the goddess. When a young boy is seemingly healed,devotion turns to fanaticism,as the destructive power of ignorance takes hold in the absence of rational thought.

Her husband returning is shocked and tries to free her through persuasion and reason,but she has begun to believe, losing all sense of her own individuality. She becomes a victim of a quarrel that develops between her husband and father-in-law. The repeated imagery of window bars, darkness and shadows, and veils and curtains reflect the pervasive sense of confinement, oppression, and unenlightenment within the household. We see the fragility of spirituality in a decadent,selfish,indulgent society. She becomes imprisoned and at the mercy of the people when things go wrong.",1279065600,3,1855,5.645161290322581

8360753,1,B002B65T7A,The other reviews are correct. This won't play on most standard US DVD players. It will work on my computer but the not-so-great image does not make it worth the bother. Maybe Criterion will pick it up but this is not one of Ray's best films by a long shot.,1412380800,3,257,4.16
8360754,5,B002B65T7A,"This is a wonderful movie, but not surprising in that it was directed by Satyajit Ray.

It should also bring to Western audiences a reminder of how important goddesses are in India.  Western audiences are used to thinking of Indian women as oppressed (and there is some truth in that) but the other part of the story tends not to be told by Western media.

Hinduism splits into three major and many minor parts.  The three major parts are worshipers of Vishnu, worshipers of Shiva, and worshipers of a goddess, usually Durga in one of her many aspects.  Goddess worship is very prominent in Gujarat and Bengal.",1412294400,,610,4.663551401869159

8360756,1,B002B65T7A,"Despite being promoted as playable in all regions, this Mr. Bongo disc will not play on new DVD equipment in the U.S.  We have here a case not of deceptive advertising but of outright fraud.",1391212800,4,190,4.428571428571429
8360757,3,B002B65T7A,"This is a great, 5-star movie, but the image quality of this version is very poor.  It is grainy, scratchy, and the contrast is so high the much of the fine chiaroscuro cinematography is lost in black.  Be warned.",1384128000,,213,4.435897435897436
8360758,1,B002B65T7A,"BE WARNED: This DVD will not play on my standard Sony DVD player even though Amazon describes it as ""Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.)"" The reason is that it is in PAL format. So dig through the fine print in your DVD player manual to make sure that it will play PAL format before you buy this DVD. My Region 1 Sony will play NTSC only, so it will not play it.",1300924800,3,367,3.972972972972973
