6754007,5,B00OJN1CHE,"I attended a screening of this documentary in the spring of 2014.  I left a changed person.  I couldn't get this out of my mind and decided it must have been a calling for me to take action.  I've since shown this film several times and started a Farm-Vet program in Spokane, WA.  We have our first Farm-Vet intern coming on board next month and have partnered with our community college to offer beginning farm/rancher courses.  All because of the impact of this film.  I cannot express enough how important this is to our Vets and our food supply in America.  We will be holding a Small Farms Conference in November 2015 and will feature the film again.  We hope to educate more people about PTSD and how we can help our Vets help themselves in a career where they can become fully alive again.  Powerful.",1422403200,,807,4.472602739726027
6754008,5,B00OJN1CHE,"There is no greater feeling of joy than to see how working with the land has the power to heal. Vets traumatized with PTSD, addiction and many other types of issues are given a win-win opportunity to restart their lives, obtain gainful employment upon leaving the service and be healed in the process. And as the vets heal, the land heals. A powerful story on how communities can work together to grow and thrive.",1422403200,,413,4.594594594594595

6754060,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Great film that should inspire veterans to make a difference in what goes on the table.  I am excited for them.  Being a farmer, I can see the excitement in the faces of the veterans who realize how important being able to grow nutritious food is.  And, bless the mentors who are able to help some of these men and women get started in the various aspects of agriculture whether it be animal husbandry, dairying, fruits, vegetables, hydroponics, and even fish farming or coming up with a marketable product like that guy's hot sauce.

6754067,4,B00OJN1CHE,"Poorly edited and laid out, but a great story nonetheless. Often times the music playing in the background as someone is being interviewed is too loud, and the scrolling titles are difficult to read and make you lose attention to what the person is saying. It's as though this was edited entirely on an iPhone, by a 5th grader. With the post-production notes aside, I really liked the message and especially getting to see the success stories that are these veterans working in the agricultural industry. Again, a great story and so happy some of my fellow vets had the chance to heal with their hands in the soil.",1430784000,,614,4.6422018348623855

6754099,5,B00OJN1CHE,"This film is absolutely brilliant! It provides one simple and powerful solution to two complex problems: jobs and rehabilitation for our veterans, and securing our country's food production. The farmer-veterans were inspiring and engaging, and I was moved by how they were able to reclaim their lives and in a way to continue their mission by working with the land and nurturing life through sustainable farming.  It wasn't preachy, and didn't have any pro-war or anti-war hidden agenda. Just stories of hope and a solution that works. Honest and straightforward. The movie itself was really well done. Great cinematography, directing, editing, music, an all around well constructed doc. The shorter runtime kept it interesting and on point. I can't recommend this highly enough. I salute our veterans in sustainable ag!",1423180800,,820,5.3076923076923075

6754132,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Finally, a solution oriented approach for our returning veterans and their future. Ground Operations clearly relays the
continuing challenges experienced by many veterans returning home. The grace comes in not leaving the vets there but respectfully
acknowledging the intelligence, ambition, and potential of affecting America by their participation in farming enterprises. Once again these
valuable sons and daughters of the United States can serve in its country's future, and we with them.
Listen to the stories within Ground Operations. You will hear familiar voices from a recent past breaking into the wholeness of a brilliant
future.
Our Rotary Club felt privileged to be able to support the film. Any Rotary Club would.",1423180800,,727,5.5
6754133,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Watched this film tonight.  As a Veteran myself, it was heartwarming to see my fellow Vets turning their energy into yet another wonderful service to the country they love.  The film was great and my only fault with it was it was too short, I watched a second time immediately after watching it the first time because it was so good.",1423094400,,333,4.442622950819672
6754134,5,B00OJN1CHE,"America needs a million new farmers.  Veterans want the job!
My favorite scene is where a young farmer is holding two baby goats in his arms, ""I just got these on Craigslist!"" Our veterans have a multitude of skills in computers, machinery, management, teamwork, long days and hard work.
Our veterans are looking for new challenging careers at the same time that the USDA is calling for one million new farmers and ranchers in the next ten years to replace the 50% of American farmers who are at retirement age. Agricultures problem is the veterans solution. Citizens are clamoring for access to more affordable, locally grown, fresh food in their communities, from the urban core to the suburban and rural countryside. The Cavalry coming over the hill is just that  its the Marines, Navy, Army, Air Force and National Guard. In a world full of problems, GROUND OPERATIONS is a story about solutions.",1423094400,,900,4.875816993464053
6754135,4,B00OJN1CHE,"I had the chance to see the Trailer for this film while attending the GI Film Festival in LA, California. Whether you are Active Duty, Veteran, or someone who cares about the food you eat this is a film that speaks to the heart. Kudos to the individuals/team who saw this through and had a vision for returning members of the Armed Forces. This film is a great opportunity for others to learn about options that may exist",1423094400,,421,4.410256410256411

6754137,5,B00OJN1CHE,This film does a fabulous job of bringing the view into the world of the soldier returned from battle including the struggle to forge a meaningful new career path and integrate back into society.  The opportunity and great synergy in bringing together returned veterans with organic farming brings hope and inspires action.  These are real stories.  The tremendous long term potential of this movement is too important to all of us to miss.  You absolutely must watch this film.,1423008000,,478,5.012658227848101
6754138,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Loved this movie! Well put together, nice mix of facts & figures to substantiate the message, ""we need veteran farmers.""  It easily spells out the problems that many of our military encounter while providing a viable solution. Helps identify a new mission, the healing powers of working the earth (creating something with your own two hands) while feeding ourselves and our neighbors wholesome food.  Definitely should be part of all TAP (Transitional Assistance Program) briefings!",1423008000,,482,5.413333333333333
6754139,5,B00OJN1CHE,"For the first time in decades the number of our farmers is increasing in the U.S. This documentary and and the grassroots movement it both documented and sparked are the reasons why. Veterans, their loved ones, those interested in local and organic foods and farming, and anyone who wants to see our world a greener, cleaner, and better place must watch this film.",1423008000,,364,4.7936507936507935
6754150,5,B00OJN1CHE,"This was a very powerful film for me, as a military spouse.  My husband and I intend to become market growers once he retires from the Navy, and this documentary opened my eyes to how very fortunate we are that he came back from 'over there' the same person he was when he left.  The same can't be said for many of our soldiers and sailors, and aren't we fortunate as a country that so many of them have answered the call to provide food for the same country they previously answered the call to serve.",1423008000,,502,4.21875
6754151,5,B00OJN1CHE,"This film depicts a much needed solution to  problems many are continuing to search for answers to. How to we help our brave veterans who return from war and can't fit into the corporate world? How do you translate skills that are relevant to the military but do not translate into civilian life? How do we solve the problem of monoculture dominating our country while there is an increasing desire for artisan, slow food, local, sustainable, & organic food? What will happen when most of the independent farmers retire and no one wants to continue farming in this manner? This film wonderfully depicts the win-win-win solution of transitioning military heroes into agriculture and how it answers all of these questions. The USDA is calling for 1,000,000 farmers in the next 10 years to feed our country and many veterans have the work ethic, drive and determination to move from the battle field to the farm field. This is an excellent movie that offers hope and solutions for vocation, mind, body and souls for soldiers who have served in combat!!!",1423008000,,1050,4.865921787709497
6754152,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Incredibly powerful and uplifting documentary about the connections created between veterans and the land. As a veteran and aspiring farmer, I received a lot of validation for the path I am making for myself, as well as the understanding that there are others like me.

6754153,5,B00OJN1CHE,"This is an important film for our time.  It illustrates in an intelligent and entertaining manner the issues faced by soldiers as they return to the country for whom they have made huge sacrifices.  It is human on a human scale, yet it speaks to the issue of American priorities an the path we are taking as a nation.  It is a great way to share something meaningful with family and friends who may have different political beliefs because it speaks to everyone about some basic American values: homeland, food, service to country, family, community, overcoming adversity.",1423008000,,572,4.876288659793815

6754183,5,B00OJN1CHE,"It's distressing to me to see how many vets come home traumatized and rudderless.  Oh how happy I was to see this film, which chronicles a beautiful transformation. Troubled vets pick up a bag of seeds, plant them, nurture them to harvest and in some wonderful way, they begin to heal. And we need farmers. The knowledge is fading with the older generation and these young men and women are picking up the challenge. They see how farming is a way to continue expressing their love for America. It's beautiful to see. I loved this movie.",1422835200,,536,4.583333333333333

Dulanie does an incredible job of taking you on a journey through what our men and women in service experience during war and the sometimes hard-to-see wounds they bear as a result.

Helping our military women & men heal from their physical and mental trauma by nurturing life through agriculture is one of the best ideas since sliced bread! Let's support our veterans turned farmers! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I thought there was a bit too much war footage in the beginning which I would rather see converted to more footage of the veterans starting their own farms.

6754188,5,B00OJN1CHE,"This is not your typical independent movie.  It's a forthright and compelling look at how military veterans can enter into farming at a scope and scale at which they can find success.  As the farmer-veterans tell their own stories in their own words, it becomes clear how valuable agriculture can be in their lives.
This film manages to pull at heartstrings without any sense of cloying manipulation.  In other words, it's honest.  Watch the move and learn.",1422835200,,457,4.896103896103896

With power, respect, drama, and love, this film takes you where you couldn't ever go unless you're a veteran of the Middle Eastern wars or a farmer. And let's face it, how many of us are?

6754206,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Produced and directed by Dulanie Ellis, Ground Operations tells an almost literal swords-to-ploughshares story of the solving of two American problems with one solution.

Problem One: Our nations treatment of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is shameful  as evidenced by unemployment, homelessness, suicide, mental illness, and the well-documented inability of the Veterans Administration to respond to disability claims in a timely manner.

Problem Two: Our national and global populations continue to grow out of control, approaching 9 billion this century. The United States is facing a serious farmer shortage. (The world, of course, a devastating shortage of food and drinking water.)

Ellis tells the story of a movement to help Iraq and Afghanistan veterans find training and work as farmers  work that turns out to be both meaningful and healing. She interviews authorities, but it is the veterans themselves who tell the story  of the horrors they experienced, of the state of their health and their lives upon return, and of how farming dramatically improved their well-being and gave them meaningful employment, or even restored a meaningful, purposeful life.

We learn, too  and not surprisingly  that in entering the plant and animal growing business these veterans are discovering the many food issues that have been so well documented by filmmakers within the last couple decades. Issues of food quality, issues of the economics of growing and distribution, and issues of public health.

It appears our veterans will be having a positive impact on these issues.

As the film ended I found myself reflecting on our national awareness of people with disabilities, that it seemed awareness and concern for them expanded during and after the Vietnam War  as a result of the hundreds of thousands wounded young men who returned to an unhappy, unsupportive world. It also seems that this societal evolution peaked with the 1990 signing of the Americans With Disabilities Act. No doubt it was the activism of veterans that fertilized these societal changes. So, I wax hopeful when I imagine that veterans entering the food growing worlds will have a favorable impact on food quality and distribution issues.",1422748800,,2212,5.306590257879656

6754209,5,B00OJN1CHE,"Soil. Soul. Healing. These experiences are the perfect antidote to war. I fell in love with this movie, which is very personal and powerful with the stories of real soldiers coming home to learn how to work as farmers and sustainable farmers, at that. Ground Operations will first break then open your heart. The idea that America needs so very many farmers, and that so many soldiers need jobs but more importantly need to feel useful to their country, and that they can be  given the opportunity to learn how to plow their emotions into their fields, is so essential to the future of our country. This movie quickly encapsulates the issues and the solution. A rare thing in a film to provide a solution. Ground Operations does the job.",1422576000,4,737,4.6692307692307695

Few things on this planet restore the soul and bring peace like farming do. Loved the facts and info provided in this film as well.
