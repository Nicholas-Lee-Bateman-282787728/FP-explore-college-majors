8265917,5,B0017HEYAW,"This DVD consists of three short films. The first is simply a ballet class with Fernando Bujones. The second is a short documentary about the dancer with extensive excerpts from ballets. At the end of this documentary is an interesting composition to the music of Mikis Theodorakis, a composer almost ignored in this country. The third film is a documentary about his participation in the competition at Varna, Bulgaria in 1974 at just 19 years of age. If you like Bujones...and what is there not to like? ...you will enjoy these three films.",1523923200,,542,4.838709677419355

8265920,3,B0017HEYAW,"Fernando Bujones happens to be a favorite of a friend who was a ballet dancer.  There isn't much available on DVD of his dancing.
This is too bad because he is a fine dancer.  I never had the opportunity to see him dance in person, so I've tried to see his work on available DVD's.",1372377600,2,281,4.090909090909091
8265921,5,B0017HEYAW,"I rented this DVD on the Netflix first and decided to purchase it after discovering a treasure in taking a ballet class with Fernando Bujones. His clear, prince like style of movement execution is what dancers need to achieve during barre training. It says that the class is for the intermediate level of students, but I think that advanced and professional dancers would benefit from watching/taking the class. I hope that the name of Fernando Bujones would not be forgotten.",1282262400,,476,4.9625
8265922,5,B0017HEYAW,I really adore this dancer. I had the opportunity to see him dancing twice in my country and I'm a deep admiration of Mr. Bujones.,1246752000,2,130,4.24
8265923,3,B0017HEYAW,"This DVD gives a good ""synopsis"" of Bujones, but it is a bit too ""precious"" in its scenes of him walking in the surf and studying himself in the mirror.  His dancing, while superb, does not measure up to the hype of the dialogue.  His role in ""Giselle"" was a disappointment.......for true ballet critics, i suggest Roberto Bolle's rendition.  This one left me somewhat let-down.",1220659200,,378,4.7846153846153845
