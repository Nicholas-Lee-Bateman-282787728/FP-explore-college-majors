Absolutely loved it when I was approaching 40, and now approaching 70; but why in God's name would anyone WANT to EVER replace Nights in White Satin with ANYTHING else. Dropped acid listening to Nights in White Satin album, back in the 60's.
Why kill the buzz at the very end on an amazing 1st year. The late Sharkey and Wahl deserved the original soundtrack.",1511049600,,429,4.512820512820513

8014946,5,B0001MSGS0,"In case anybody besides Amazon missed it, Ken Wahl played Vincent Terranova for at least the first three seasons of Wiseguy.  I'm not sure if he was replaced by Stephen Bauer (the actor who played ""Manny"", Tony Montana's buddy in Scarface) beginning with season 4 or later, but ALL of the Amazon product descriptions which state that these boxed sets of Wiseguy star Stephen Bauer and NOT Ken Wahl are INCORRECT.",1190764800,,412,4.802816901408451
8014947,4,B0001MSGS0,"I agree with the previous reviewer - the Sonny Steelgrave arc was brilliant, with superb performances from Ken Wahl, Jonathon Banks and Ray Sharkey. But why take out the song 'Nights in White Satin' which was the perfect backdrop to the final confrontation? The song highlighted the emotions that the Vinnie and Sonny were feeling and really added to the scene. Other than that, I can't recommend the DVD highly enough.",1106006400,6,419,4.915492957746479
8014948,5,B0001MSGS0,"I just finished the Sonny Steelgrave arc and was disappointed with only one thing. In the last episode of the Arc, when Sonny and Vinnie are in the theater, they changed the background music from the original. They kept Good Lovin', but replaced Nights in White Satin with some nondescript instrumental track. Other than that, the set was great!",1089417600,8,345,4.864406779661017
