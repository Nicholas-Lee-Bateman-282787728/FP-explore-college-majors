Man it so funnny that I had to pause the movie everey now and then just to stop laughing and believe me the story is somthing new and original. I recommend this for anyone who want a good laugh or anyone who enjoyed Golden Boy,...Project Ako or dragon half.",1023580800,6,397,4.102564102564102
1419523,5,B00005B1VN,I love this movie about a girl named Natsumi who gets a present from her father of a weird statue who uses the two gems to make a pair of earrings & winds up with a strange necklace from the God Ahem to become Mii after doing a weird dance taught to her by Ahem to battle Ongo's mischief tricks & finally destroys a evil demon that posses Ongo with the help of Rongo. I watch the movie over & over. I think they should make more episodes of the movie.,1017100800,3,451,3.967032967032967
1419524,3,B00005B1VN,"Most people, I know rave about this show, but several flaws come close to ruining it. The two male leads may be interesting in their own right, but they're really too similar to one another for either to stand out. Add to that the mildly racist characature of the African-American lead, and you've got a considerable problem.
The female leads are fairly typical super-hero type characters, but although stereotypical, it's pulled off remarkably well. Slapstick humor is the main draw, but it gets just a little repetitive after awhile.
Still, I shouldn't downplay the positive aspects. I really laughed a lot, and if you're willing to overlook a few flaws, the anime is pretty enjoyable. Plus, the DVD has good picture quality, and the extra features won't make you scream too much. If you have the option to rent then do it, but if you're looking to expand your anime library, you could do worse.",1016150400,,897,4.7935483870967746
1419525,2,B00005B1VN,"I hardly consider myself a ""prude"" and I am not easily shocked by sex jokes (hey, I *love* Ping Pong Club and liked Miyuki-chan in Wonderland)... but this anime is probably not worth buying to the average consumer.  There are some cute jokes (I was struck by Ongo's physical and mental similarity to Flint of ""Flint the Time Detective"", so you see the level we're on) but a *lot* of oversized mammary glands (REALLY huge), panty shots and cheap sex jokes.  I didn't find myself laughing much - the jokes were *OLD* ones, not even refreshing or really entertaining.  The plot was predictable.  Yeah, the music was catchy (I do like the opening song, I believe it was sung by Masami Okui who did the songs for Slayers and Utena), but if you just want the music, buy the soundtrack!  The art-style was very reminiscent of Maze and Slayers.  But again: lots of stupid, stupid sex jokes... and Takuma's adolescent-boy lust just got irritating, not funny (like I think it was MEANT to be).
If you like sex-infused HUMOR and original concepts, try other sources.  I still recommend Ping Pong Club (although if you shock really easily, you may want to go to something softer ^.^) and Maze & Those Who Hunt Elves are always fun... but this one is a waste of money.  If you *MUST* see it, rent it or go to an anime convention and see it in the video rooms.  Don't waste your money.",1005609600,5,1371,4.495967741935484
1419526,5,B00005B1VN,"If you like the adolecent humor found in teen anime (think Ranma 1/2), then you'll definitely want to watch the tale of a young girl who finds herself in control of a great power... the power of a goddess! Unfortunately, for her, she must perform a 'fertility dance' to raise the power to transform!  The characters are memorable, the music is catchy and you'll find yourself quoting lines for months afterward.",994118400,5,411,4.788732394366197
1419527,4,B00005B1VN,"once ya get past the BIG boobs. There is actually a story in this fan service animation. I'm not saying this is a classic, but there are some generally hysterical moments, and all of them are pretty realistic outcomes to the crazy things going on in the story. I won't say what. You'll just have to see it. If you are a cynic and want to pick apart the jokes and outcomes to the show, it WILL beat you to the punch. This show knows what it is and has no problems making fun of its' self. That alone gets high marks from me. This is a fun video. And all the girls ( the legal ones ) are hot.",993859200,8,590,3.925

1419539,4,B00005B1VN,"My first purchase of on Amamzon and I was thrilled with the speed but thats not what I want to talk about. Jungle De Ikou is a short series pretty much stating that bewbs and less plot is important. In a way it's true but the series is far more entertaining than that. It had comedy, bewbs and thin plot so I was pleased with this thinnly veild series.",1311724800,,352,4.115942028985507
1419540,5,B00005B1VN,"I really like this show.  I have the tape, but I'll get the DVD soon.

A twist on the ""Child becomes an adult"" fantasy, perhaps a bit disturbing to some because of all the ""Fan service"" and light adult themes.

But, overall it's a fun show.  A young girl gets a 'present' from her ""Japanese Businessman"" father who's business trip was thwarted when they found ancient ruins on a site they were going to deforest/strip mime/use as a toxic waste dump or whatever.  So he robs an ancient statue which she defaces to get the emeralds to make into earrings.  This releases a deadly ancient spirit, and the ""God of Creation"" who appears as a rather warped sterotype of ""Primitive"" gods gives the girl power to fight him.

My favorite character appears later in the show, a shy and creepy girl who's obsessed with UFO's and stuff.

Given America's taboos, a few scenes (like a bathtub scene) have clearly been edited.  Still, the story's still there and it's a fun show.  A bit naughty for the main characters being kids, but not 1/10 as bad as ""South Park"".",1207353600,,1051,4.542553191489362
1419541,5,B00005B1VN,"After reading the reviews, one would almost expect an hour of a very bosomy lady dancing and gyrating wildly. That actually last a total of maybe a minute. A minute that you will not soon forget if you enjoy that type of thing. Mii is extremely attractive and moves very, very well.

The story and music are quite good really. Enough to stand on their own merit. The bosomy features that appear after the transformation is what everybody focuses on. To be expected since the box cover so proudly displays that. I enjoyed it and thought it was quite clever really.",1170115200,2,563,4.574257425742574
1419542,5,B00005B1VN,"Nasumi's father has brought back a relic from an ancient ruin found deep, deep in the jungle of Myuginia.  Within the relic was Ongo, God of Destruction.

And then things are wild.  First, a necklace now allows her to call on the power of Mie, a flower spirit.  A big busted flower spirit.  A spirit whose form she takes when she calls on her power.

Lots of panty shots, weird X-rated dancing, silly spells and only three episodes.  I guess it was meant to be a stand alone really tiny mini series.  It's OK but try to get it used.  Besides the art gallery and production sketches there isn't really much in the way of extras.",1149724800,5,627,4.336206896551724
1419543,4,B00005B1VN,"Back when it was created I don't believe huge boobs were common in anime, so I guess it was unique then. Honestly, I just got it for the fanservice, so the story was a bit distracting... could have used more of Mii though. I would recommend Eiken over this, but Jungle De Ikou is still pretty good. About the DVD itself, extras include production art and a gallery of the images used for the packaging. One bad point is, the songs have unremovable subtitles, but this DVD is worth it if you can get it cheap.",1130457600,7,508,4.302083333333333
1419544,5,B00005B1VN,"Natsumi gets a weird-looking statue from her father, who got it from New Guinea.  The statue holds Ongo,  God of Destruction, who was sealed within the statue by Ahem, God of Earth.  When Natsumi breaks the seal, Ahem gives her a necklace of skulls and teaches her a dance.  The dance changes Natsumi into the large-breasted flower spirit Mii, who uses magic to fight the forces of evil.  Mii's bosom jiggles like jell-o and you're amazed how a person can stay up with those massive mammaries.

  The animation is good, the plot is actually good (though, it has a LOT of fan service in it).  Not for kids.",1129248000,9,605,4.527777777777778

1419546,3,B00005B1VN,"I bought it mostly cuz I was looking for something like decent hentai with good animation that isn't chock full of women in pain.  This series(cut short after 3 episodes) doesn't have that, but quite a bit of fan service which is probably what you're looking for if the cover caught your eye.

The service delivers for the most part but quickly took a back seat with me once plot happenings started rolling as it really isn't always the focus.  It tells the tale of some gods from the jungle awakening and doing battle in Japan.  They fight each other with magic, dances, rituals, chants, etc. which are usually pretty easy on the eyes.  A good few of the characters are interesting such as Nasumi/Mie, who is a respectable young girl with a strong head who ends up having to save Japan.  She's similar to Akane in Ranma 1/2.  Occompanied by her is the god of Destruction Ongo, a rather unassuming character from the jungle and Ahem the Earth god.  I found these two characters the most enjoyable of the show as they provide distraction from trite dialogue.  Sometimes the exchanges between characters are funny and natural, other times they are painfully silly and stupid(like when the focus turns to Mie's bosom).  I had to laugh when I heard the voice actors trying to seriously deliver some of these lines. I've found cringe-inducing dialogue to be nothing new with anime, it's present here but not always prevalent.  I made use of the skip forward button on my dvd player due to the dialogue and bad plot development.  Some things happen throughout the story that seem poorly written in(like Ongo and his magical limitations) so I would skip past them while the characters try to tie everything together.

Overall I would have to say I enjoyed the strong ancient religious themes of the story the most(gods, possessions, spells, enchantments, etc.).  I don't think they will offend, but they are there and they help to move the story along. The fan service is well animated and rather nice, as I rarely see characters so well-endowed move so well.  As a movie/series it's patchy but with promise if the writers figured out what they want to do(focus on fan service, or plot).  It seems the movie can't decide wether it wants to be a naughty romp or something more along the lines of Ranma where humor and strong characters drive the story.

A reviewer said that the god Ahem is a slightly racist charicature, I would disagree.  He seems like the standard 'dirty old man' character with purpose crossed with a witch doctor, I wasn't offended and didn't sense anything that came across as a mock of any demographic.  Though I would like to know how old these girls are supposed to be before transformation, I read they are supposed to be 10 years old(excuse me?). The box says it's for those 13 and up, I wouldn't recommend it for children.

The review is a bit spotty, but I'd say that attests to Jungle de Ikou's own spottiness.  The main question boils down to: Do you like the cover? Go with your instinct on that one... it's about what you'd expect though there is no nudity, just alluring dance moves, fine animation, and some sicko's pre-pubescent fantasies.  If you're looking at this, that's what you were looking for.  Not really recommended though I was glad I sniffed this film out finally.",1111795200,22,3305,4.679930795847751
1419547,5,B00005B1VN,"if you've seen some anime, the cover illustration probably makes you think of something like Ranma 1/2 movie 2 (the one one the beach, where are the girls jiggle around more than usual) or Mahou Tsukai Tai (that episode where Miyama entertains the crew at her private night-time beach party).  Well, this anime definitely carries out its promise.  It's that kind of silly show, and yes the boobs really are that huge, and yes they are lavishly animated.  So, if the cover looks good to you, don't hesitate even for a minute, just buy it.  If it's a little off-putting, I'd say skip it unless you have a real fondness for this genre.
It's a crime that they don't make more episodes.",1055980800,11,681,4.557377049180328

7936172,4,B00005B1VN,"Though only a three episode short series it was highly entertaining. Nonsensical, crazy and bonkers to boot. The madness and hilarity start when a high-spirited girl becomes the unwitting and very unwilling vessel to the Flower Spirit Mei given to her by the weird as hell Earth Spirit Ahem. It's now her job to make sure the Spirit of Destruction Ongo doesn't destroy the entire world. It's fanservice to the max in this little show that kinda falls on it's face at the end but it was still good",1523232000,,496,4.584269662921348

7936176,4,B00005B1VN,"I knew what I was buying, and this show had somehow found it's way on my radar long ago. I had just assumed it would be one of those weird fringe animes that I'd only ever get to see in gif clip format. It was enjoyable, if not questionable.

Looking at the cover, you should know what you're buying. Boobs, boobs, and more bewbs. A short three episodes, it's a quick and funny watch as a 10 year something old comes in possession of, well, being possessed by the mega-busty spirit of Mie. But only after she performs an extremely questionable dance for a 10 year something. And she only learns this performance after the bug-eyed, old earth spirit shows her the the dance in his native-wear. That's essentially the whole gimmick of the show, odd and very suggestive dances performed by children to attain magic powers. The water spirit had me exclaim WTF out loud just by how un-subtle her dance was. Seriously, I knew what I was getting into, but somehow it still managed to surprise me.

Other than bewbs, provocative dances, and character nosebleeds by the young boys of the show, it was a fairly tame show that managed to be funny, and remarkably simple. I could see children watching this show. I wouldn't WANT them to watch it as I would fear they'd mime the dances, but as far as the atmosphere of the show generates, it is very casual and fun. Like Sailor Moon, but with back-breaking huge boobs. There's no harsh language, and very minimal violence. Just magical powers and the power of love! For three episodes, if you could pick it up for cheap like I did, you should find some humor and entertainment in the ridiculousness of the show.",1435104000,,1648,4.545454545454546
