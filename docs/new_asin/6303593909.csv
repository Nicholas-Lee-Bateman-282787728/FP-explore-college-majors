7851550,5,6303593909,As a child- this movie along with it's sequel were among my favorite movies as a kid. The movie was origanally in a different Language and was re dubbed in English- the acting and the animation are a bit over the top- but that adds to the movie. i watched it with my nieces and nepews who are between the ages of 3 and 5 and they all enjoyed it as did i. Plus it was narrated by Elvira which added to the appeal of the film. the animation and all my be considered corny by todays standards but it is still a great family film.,1273017600,,526,3.9716981132075473

7851552,4,6303593909,"A cute approach to making introducing your small fry to the wonderful world of vampires.  It will be interesting to see if this innoculates the little tykes when they upgrade to Lugosi, Langella, et al.  This is what happens in a world where most kids are introduced to vampires with the Count on ""Sesame Street.""",973296000,2,313,4.672727272727273
