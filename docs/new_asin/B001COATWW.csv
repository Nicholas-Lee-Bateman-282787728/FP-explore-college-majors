Traces of Death II... in the shockingly graphic series, is my least favorite entry in the set and for some reason I have had more difficulty trying to acquire this film then any of the others ones. Don't get me wrong though, it is still equally disturbing and I had never seen it before I owned the box set. Again, this shockumentary is put together like most death scene videos, and run time is approximately 90 minutes. It is in color and black/white and it continues with absolutely no staged scenes of close-up exploding limbs, splayed cadavers, devastating car wrecks and much, much more!  It has little to no narration sticking to the tradition from Traces of Death and has allot of actual vintage footage included, which for me makes it highly collectible, and this time we are treated to a different kind of sound track instead of the usual spooky music. Producer Darron Fox attempts to upset its viewers further by uniquely placing death metal in the background by such bands as Unleashed,Morgoth,Grave, Asphyx and many more!!!

This is absolutely perfect because this genre of music is so fitting for a shockumentary and something I have not heard of before the Traces of Death series. I personally like the music and in my opinion this gives it better watch ability (sometimes I have left this movie on while I am cleaning just so I can hear the wicked music).  The movie begins with a corpse of a woman at a morgue who was already prepared for burial, only coroners are cutting the body back open huh you ask? That's right it's what's inside that counts and there going back in to retrieve...  well, I won't give away the motive so easily, but let me just say ""May the bird of paradise fly up your nose.""  Also in this installment is some rare rescue footage (or should I say the attempted rescue?) of people from burning buildings jumping out of windows and hitting obstacles on the way down. (There are, if you know your history, actual pre 911 footage of similar instances of large skyscrapers and people lunging to their deaths in trade for the wham bam thank you ma'am instead of a slow burn... what a choice huh?)

In one scene you can almost hear the smack of a foolish tight rope walker where on a windy day gets a little push (with shall I say some gusto?) before becoming one with the pavement whoa!!  There are some scenes of torturous castrations that can only be described as something to lose ones head over and for one unfortunate African man he has a whole lot to offer if you get my meaning (Remind me not to ""P'O'"" this tribe if I ever get to visit this continent please?) Once again Traces of Death brings you some never before uncut footage of an execution of a rapist and molester of children... while he is being escorted by police to a courtroom, the understandably enraged father of one of the victims, patiently waits on a payphone to enact his retribution on the scum!  When this (undoubtedly sick) man walks by, ""Daddy"" seizes the opportunity and places a single well timed bullet right through his (thick) skull. As he falls to the ground, enjoy the never before seen footage as the blood squirts out of the head of this low life's now lifeless body!!! I love that scene and better yet the brave father (who took careful aim) was later acquitted of all charges!!!

In another segment we see a group of Shamans, display there unique method of corpse removal and to put it lightly, this one is definitely for the birds... There is also (as advertised on the packaging) a giant robot transformer act at a monster truck rally where it malfunctions and goes crazily wrong, but again if you don't know the actual history, then it isn't all that spectacular and most will have no idea what went wrong (as this piece of equipment explodes a large shard of steel pierces the chest of an unfortunate controller of the large robot!!!) There are (what I call cool down periods) in each of these installments of motorcycle and auto racing accidents allowing you to catch your breath,  but none of these periods last very long and your thrown right back in to more shocking and disturbing deaths. To bring this shockumentary to a close, there is a gruesome finale of an execution that is known as being ""drawn and quartered"" a form of capital punishment where one is tied from the arms and legs (traditionally between two horses) and then pulled in opposite directions ripping the extremities away from the body this time, however, it is between two Jeeps and you see the arm of the executed rip from the shoulder as the rest of him is dragged down the dessert. All the while, onlookers watch and follow with glee and in case you didn't catch it all the first time it is shown again in slow motion just for good measure!!!

I really like this series but the poor quality of the vintage footage gets a little ""old"" also (for most people) once you've seen one ""grey matter"" then you've seen them all but Traces of Death somehow finds a way to present it to you in more bizarre and disturbing ways that will keep almost any ""gore hound"" begging for more. Turn down the lights...flame a candle...and prepare yourself... Traces of Death II... IT JUST GOT DEADER!!!",1341532800,2,5316,4.571428571428571
