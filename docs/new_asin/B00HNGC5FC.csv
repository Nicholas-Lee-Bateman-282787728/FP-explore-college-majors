6184990,5,B00HNGC5FC,"Bruce Kalish, former executive producer and head writer of Power Rangers, was a controversial force on the series. Using material lifted heavily from the source narrative while putting strong character development in the American footage (as well as letting producer Koichi Sakamoto and his stunt team go crazy with pyrotechnics and wire work), Super Sentai fans felt they were watching the same story twice (leaning towards Power Rangers being inferior to the Japanese content) and American fight sequences were too insane (sideways explosions while flying through the air fighting as an example). However, many in the Power Rangers community (myself included) felt he produced some of the best seasons of the series. In fact, I consider Jungle Fury and S.P.D. the best seasons of the show's entire run (even over the sacred Mighty Morphin material). Kalish's four years on the show gave us S.P.D., Mystic Force, Operation Overdrive, and Jungle Fury.

For S.P.D., the series jumps ahead in the not too distant future where humanity has traveled among the stars and joined the intergalactic community as alien and human live side-by-side. However, an evil force spreads across the universe that wipes out the home world of the community's military/police force and Earth's Power Rangers leaving a secondary team of Rangers, the B-Squad, to become Earth's last hope for survival. Mystic Force follows monsters from the underworld trying to invade the Earth only to be stopped by the world's magical knights and sorcerers (albeit at a grave cost). The evil would return and the survivor among those knights and sorcerers must train a new generation to save the world as Power Rangers. Operation Overdrive is the treasure hunting season as a powerful artifact breaks apart and is spread across the globe with unaffiliated malicious aliens from across the universe coming to seek assembling the item for themselves. A team of adventurers with unique skills is brought together to find the artifact's components and protect Earth as the Power Rangers. This season would also be the fifteenth in the series with a team-up special with past rangers including Adam Park from Mighty Morphin, Zeo, Turbo, and Space (played by Johnny Yong Bosch, a famous voice actor known for his starring roles in anime like Bleach, Trigun, and Code Geass). Jungle Fury would be Kalish's final season with a focus on martial arts (especially kung fu) with a distinct Hong Kong action quality paying homage to many, many areas of martial arts and action films and stars. Following the Kalish era, Disney would produce one final season of Power Rangers in R.P.M. Considered one of the best seasons of Power Rangers, R.P.M. features a world destroyed by sentient machines as the last handful of humanity retreats to a domed city for survival. Borrowing elements from Terminator and Mad Max, the series features mankind's desperate struggle as the Power Rangers must prevent the extinction of their species and destroy the machines who seek world domination.

Out of twenty years of Power Rangers, I would easily say the seasons on this set are in the top eight the show has ever produced. Between making characters multidimensional to complicating storylines beyond the simplistic ones of many seasons past to having action sequences so intense that the producers of the source material hired the man behind it to come to Japan and replicate the style, this DVD release maybe the most anticipated event for Power Rangers fans after that of Mighty Morphin alone. Every season since Space, the show's producers have tried to make the brand a better product and these five seasons are the culmination of this effort as Koichi Sakamoto brought the action to Hollywood standards and Bruce Kalish and Eddie Guzelian (who produced R.P.M.) gave us amazing stories that made us care about the characters and wonder how the heroes would triumph against such dire odds. If you're a Power Rangers fan, this is a must buy. If you're a fan of superheroes and action series, this is a must buy. If you have kids who enjoy action shows, these seasons of Power Rangers features heroes fighting monsters that's high octane and so over the top they really couldn't be replicated in real life (namely, flying through the air with explosions) giving it a Hollywood or animation quality in that regard. I can't recommend this set enough, truly an event.",1394668800,10,4402,5.06198347107438

I hope that they decide to finish & release those shows. It'll feel a little incomplete without them on my shelf.

6184995,5,B00HNGC5FC,"I have been looking forward to this box set since I found out that four of my favorite seasons of Power Rangers are in this set. I am a fan of SPD, Mystic Force, Operation Overdrive, and Jungle Fury. I thought RPM was a little lame. I have the first three Power Rangers box sets and I am really glad that they are now putting out the final box set this year. I was 14 when Mighty Morphin Power Rangers first aired and turned 31 when they aired Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Remastered in 2010. I am still a huge fan.",1388966400,18,515,4.108910891089109
6184996,5,B00HNGC5FC,"FINALLY, Power Rangers seasons 13-17 had come out for DVD for the first time ever and this box set will be the final Power Rangers seasons box set that Shout Factory will release because Shout Factory will release Samurai and Megaforce in Power Rangers Legacy Collection in a Mighty Morphin Red Ranger helmet. I love Operation Overdrive, RPM and SPD because those seasons are my favorites. Here are the seasons.

Season 13: Power Rangers SPD. One of my favorite seasons. It is about cops turned to Power Rangers fighting criminal aliens and traveling in space. Earth is now inhabited peacefully with aliens and humans. An alien commander of a police organization recruits 5 humans to be Power Rangers to stop crime and an old enemy.

Season 14: Power Rangers Mystic Force. This season is nice, but not one of my favorites. It is about 5 teens become wizard like Power Rangers fighting evil forces. Imagine Harry Potter wearing spandex, his wand become a sword like wand or a cell phone, fighting an evil knight and monsters.

Season 15: Power Rangers Operation Overdrive. One of my favorites. I found out that this season is not well liked, but oh well, who cares. This season is about brother rivals and treasure hunting. A rich man recruits 5 humans to be Power Rangers to find a powerful crown and its jewels before they fall to the wrong hands or Earth will be doomed. This season had an awesome and epic two part episodes named 'Once a Ranger' which had one of my all time favorite Power Ranger actors, Johnny Yong Bosch who plays Adam Park aka Mighty Morphin Black Ranger returning along with 4 past Rangers.

Season 16: Power Rangers Jungle Fury. In this season, an powerful enemy escapes from his prison and posses a human. 3 students from a secret dojo organization were chosen to stop him. This season is almost similar to Wild Force because they had animal spirits.

Season 17: Power Rangers RPM. The last season released from Disney era. One of my favorites. This season is one of the darkest season in Power Rangers history. This season is almost similar to the Terminator. Earth is ruined and humans are almost extinct thanks to a powerful computer virus and its machine army. 5 humans were chosen to protect the last of the humans and a small city dome from an Skynet like organization.

As a loyal fan of Power Rangers for over 20 years, I gave this season box set 5 stars.",1388880000,16,2389,4.649289099526066

6185033,5,B00HNGC5FC,"I got this set primarily so that I could bone up for the History of Power Rangers episodes that cover seasons 15-17, and was surprised at how incredibly good it was overall.  We get 4 excellent seasons, as well as the worst Disney season I've seen (though it's still enjoyable it will probably be at the bottom of my top 15).  The seasons are:

Season 13, SPD:  We begin this set with Bruce Kalish's first and best season, which happened to be one of the 2 biggest incentives for me to buy this.  An acquaintance of mine always referenced this series as one of his all-time favorites, and judging from the History of Power Rangers episodes SPD looked to be the coolest of the Disney ones reviewed so far.  It exceeded even my high expectations.  Apart from Zeo and In Space, this is easily the best season of Power Rangers I've covered so far.  For starters off, it has one of the best teams.  This is one of those rare groups where I like everybody, even the ball of light we call Sam.  They all have good characterization, and great dialogue.  But the best was Bridge.  He was hilarious and quirky.  The villains are great too.  Grumm isn't the most interesting evil leader, but he's still a competent tactician and a good fighter.  Broodwing was very interesting because he was in it for the money, and I thought Mora was hilarious.  I don't know; there was just something very funny about a little girl who while evil still acts her age.  And to top it off it's up there with Zeo and Lightspeed Rescue for coolest arsenal of Megazords.  The only complaints I had outside of a few silly filler episodes (which occur in almost every season) were two things.  One was the Kalishsplosions.  While I think Bruce Kalish for the most part did an excellent job on his run, the overly abundant explosions plagued all of them.  They do get boring after a while, but as long as the story is good it's not too bad.  The other problem I had was that the team-up episodes could have been better.  Don't get me wrong, they were definitely good episodes (certainly better than Trakeena's Revenge).  They were just missing something to make them spectacular like the other team-ups.  The worst part was seeing the Dino Thunder Rangers have their memories wiped.  It wasn't so bad in the first one, but in the second I thought it was really stupid how Kruger wiped their memories and SPD's too.  Was that really necessary?  Maybe it was because they were much closer in time than the Time Force Rangers, but all they had to do was say ""Hey we're Power Rangers from the future.  We're hunting a villain.  Would you like to help us?"" and there would be little to no chance of time being rewritten.  It makes me wonder if there was a team-up in Mystic Force but whoever sees it gets their memories of it wiped.  But those are my only complaints.  Apart from those, this season is awesome.
5 stars.

Season 14, Mystic Force: Like the other megaset I've reviewed, the second season in it is the weakest one.  I'm sorry; did you think I was talking about Operation Overdrive when I said this set had Disney's worst on it?  I hate to disappoint you but like Tyler, DC, Ronda Pennycuff, Jerry Whitworth, & LJDB I do not rank that season down there with Turbo (OO fans unite!  Overdrive is underrated!).  But let me get one thing out of the way; no matter what I definitely liked this one & in the end it is a great season.  But; let's just say that no team-up is the least of this season's problems (in fact, it's probably a plus considering how the last team-up ended).  For starters off, this season's feel is different, but it's too different.  I know I said I couldn't get into it before but I gave it a second chance & definitely enjoyed it, though like I said this is the season that feels the least like Power Rangers.  Even Turbo and the very first season, my 2 least favorite seasons at the moment, feel more like PR than this season does.  There is also a little too much focus on world-building and not enough on the Rangers themselves, which is a shame because I really liked most of the team.  Chip, Xander, Madison and Vida were great characters.  But at least we got a decent focus on my least favorite member of the team, Nick.  Nick is quite possibly the worst Red Ranger ever.  He is for the most part not bad but sometimes he seems to be the first one to give up.  That said, there was still plenty to like about this season.  Even if the side characters got more focus than I would have given them, they were still entertaining.  Phineas and Genji were funny and had good story arcs.  Clare was a good character, but a poor comic relief.  It was not funny seeing her fail all the time, because she was so nice she didn't deserve that.  If she had been like Bulk & Skull in the first season, then it would have been funny.  Of course, that made her becoming a real sorceress even more rewarding.  The villains were fine.  While they weren't exactly memorable they were all interesting, not annoying like Divatox's crew in Turbo & Vypra, nor were they boring like the other villains in Lightspeed Rescue.  Also, this series does fix one of the problems I had with SPD; there were no silly filler episodes.  Some episodes counted more than others, but it felt like the plot moved at least an inch every episode.  Really, this season is more flawed than it is bad.  I honestly enjoyed every episode as like I said they all counted for something; and the best episodes (like Stranger Within, Dark Wish & most of the last disc) were very good.  Overall it's currently my 3rd least favorite season, but it's still pretty good overall.
4 stars.

Season 15, Operation Overdrive:  Bruce Kalish quickly redeems himself with the most underrated season of all.  Will someone please explain to me why this season is so bad?  I can't see why so many people hate it for the life of me.  I know I gave the first volume of the original release a mediocre score, but I re-watched the first 6 episodes and while I still say Weather Or Not and Pirate In Pink were meh, the others were much more enjoyable on a second viewing (The pilot was excellent; why did I give it an A- grade?).  But apart from those 2 and the clipshow (which was watchable but you could skip it and not miss anything), I greatly enjoyed all the other episodes.  I personally found the idea of a treasure hunt season where most of the episodes flowed on into the next to be fascinating.  It was a definite improvement over the early days of Mighty Morphin', which could have a dozen or more filler episodes in between key stories.  I really liked all of the characters.  Even the villains were intriguing.  The Fearcats were interesting and active villains.  I have heard a couple people complain about how they always leap out of their robots before they're destroyed, but that doesn't annoy me.  It's certainly a better excuse than getting turned into a giant and teleporting away before the Megazord's finishing move makes contact with you.  *cough*Goldar!*cough*  Kamdor and Miratrix were also cool.  Moltor and Flurious weren't the best villains, but they were still fine.  Even Norg, who annoyed me in the early episodes, turned out to be pretty funny.  The 2 part episodes were especially good.  To make up for the lack of team-up episodes in the next 2 seasons, we have Once a Ranger, which was awesome.  Considering the conditions (4 Disney Rangers and one Saban one), they could not have picked a better team.  Bridge was my favorite character in SPD, Tori and Kayley were my favorite Rangers from their respective seasons (apart from the sixth Ninja Storm Ranger Cam, and the returning veteran Tommy), Xander was my second favorite in Mystic Force after Chip, and Adam is next to Tommy my favorite of the Mighty Morphin'/Zeo Rangers.  Overall, I love this season and it is one of my top ten.  I don't care what you say or what you do; it will still remain there.  Even if you were pointing a gun at my head I would still praise this season.
5 stars.

Season 16, Jungle Fury:  Bruce Kalish finishes his run with another excellent season.  I'm sorry to hear that nobody talks about this season, because it's a really good season.  The Rangers are great, especially Casey, and RJ.  Casey deconstructs the idea of a ""Rookie Red Ranger"".  He's always training to catch up with Lily and Theo.  RJ was a funny and cool mentor.  I was really glad he became a Ranger later on.  The villains were good too.  It was interesting to see the villains always training as well as the heroes.  But quite possibly my favorite thing about this season is the fight scenes.  It might not be the best season, but this season has some of the most exciting and best choreographed battles in the whole franchise.  Not much else to say, just that this season is really good.  Unlike Mystic Force, the lack of a team-up really is the greatest flaw of this season.  Well, that and the Kalishplosions.
5 stars.

Season 17, RPM:  And we come to the 2nd and better of the 2 seasons I wanted most.  I'm not going to bother saying much more than this is without a doubt, my new favorite season.  After 11 years, they finally managed to top In Space.  The Rangers have some really good character development (their backstories are especially interesting), the dialogue is excellent, the story is very engaging, and the villains are the best.  Oh, and the Zords are awesome too.  Even the Klaishplosions and cribbing a subplot from a classic season doesn't drag this down (the explosions are a lot more bearable for some reason, and said subplot felt more like an homage than a rip-off).  The set was worth getting just for this.
5 stars.

And to top it off the special features are great as usual. I honestly think they're even better than the ones in the Seasons 4-7 set as they talk much more about the seasons in here than the franchise as a whole.  In conclusion, this is without a doubt my favorite Power Rangers set of all.  This has 4 of my top ten seasons (including my new favorite), and the other one is good too.  If you're a Power rangers fan you must get this collection.",1412812800,6,10110,4.484914975315414

6185039,5,B00HNGC5FC,"I've never been a fan of the Disney-era Power Rangers shows. The show was never a terribly high priority for the company and the show's entertainment quality seemed to decline when production moved to New Zeland. But watching the Disney-era series after getting this boxed set, the episodes are much better than I initially gave them credit for. Mostly.

Power Rangers: S.P.D. is the 13th season, and is touted on the back of the box as a ""fan-favorite,"" and I can see why. The show finally takes the darker turn that many fans had been wishing for (""Time Force"" and ""Lightspeed Rescue"" took similar turns, but we were right back to silly by the time ""Wild Force"" came about). S.P.D. A-Squad vanishes and it's up to S.P.D. B-Squad to find out what happened to them. Season 14, ""Mystic Force,"" is kinda weird. The season introduces the heavy use of magic into the series, and also features the return of Rita Repulsa, now called the ""Mystic Mother."" A plus, but the season quality waffles between good and bad. ""Operation Overdrive"" features a more serialized story with the Rangers seeking a set of stones that will save the world. ""Jungle Fury"" sees a team of Rangers adopting the powers of the animals to take on a new threat, and ""RPM"" sees a team of Rangers defending the walled city of Corinth in a post-apocalyptic setting.

The special features, again, live up to the bar set by Shout Factory. Each set has included a feature focusing on fans. This time, the fans look at their favorite bits of Ranger merchandise. The set also includes several promos for the seasons in the boxed set, as well as a look at the sets and props for the show, as well as individual features looking at the SPD, Mystic Force, and Operation Overdrive Rangers. There is also the obligatory booklet with photos, biographies, and episode guides. The only complaint about the booklets in the Shout Factory sets has been the lack or air-dates; I praise Shout Factory for their overall consistency with the sets, but I guess I'm gonna have to write in the air-dates myself.

Shout Factory finishes out their Power Ranger boxed sets strong with a final set featuring seasons 13-17! Pick it up today!",1409702400,,2177,4.708661417322834

6185055,5,B00HNGC5FC,"So at least now every season of Power Rangers has a DVD release (with the exception of Super Megaforce of course since it is the newest season).
In this final Mega box set from Shout! Factory you will be getting your hands on the 5 final seasons that Disney had produced during the time they owned Power Rangers.

First, you get Season 13 Power Rangers S.P.D. This was a terrific Disney Season, and is one of my favorites in the Disney Era, next to Dino Thunder anyways.

Secondly, you get Season 14 Power Rangers Mystic Force. This was also a good season as well, with a very nice plot line. Only thing I didn't like is that it didn't feature a team up with the S.P.D. Rangers, but it does make a nice reference to S.P.D. with showing Piggy in an episode foreshadowing that eventually Earth will be overrun with Aliens all over the place.

Third, you get Season 15 Power Rangers Operation Overdrive. Despite a lot of people hating on this season, I liked it. It wasn't as entertaining as previous seasons, but it was still pretty decent. Plus of course with it being the 15th Season of Power Rangers, it includes an awesome 2-part episode titled ""Once A Ranger"" which features the Overdrive Rangers teaming up with Adam, the Black Mighty Morphin Ranger, Tori, the Blue Ninja Ranger, Kira, the Yellow Dino Ranger, Bridge, the Red S.P.D. Ranger, and Xander the Green Mystic Force Ranger.

Fourth, you get Season 16 Power Rangers Jungle Fury. This was a pretty awesome Disney Season. Again the only thing I didn't like was no team up with the OO Rangers, but at least we got to see Casey appear in Super Megaforce.

Fifth, you get Season 17 Power Rangers RPM. This was the last actual season to be produced by Disney, because in 2010 all we got in Power Rangers was a re-version of the first 32 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 1 episodes. Of course later that year Saban bought back the rights to Power Rangers, and well you know the rest. RPM is considered to be one of the darkest toned seasons in the entire Power Rangers franchise, and it really is. I mean hey, it's basically Terminator but in Power Rangers form. Again, this doesn't feature a team-up with any previous Ranger teams, however Scott aka the Red RPM Ranger appears in Clash of the Red Rangers: The Movie (even though it's only a double-length episode), but I still wish at least more RPM Rangers or even the actual universe from where Scott comes from was shown, but oh well.

As with the previous box sets go, you get one bonus disc of bonus features, including the cast and crew talking about using props on the show, the cast talking about some of their favorite places on-set, a video that includes several Power Rangers collectors showing off their collection, and much more.

This is the final Power Rangers box set that Shout! Factory will be releasing, as Lionsgate is the only ones who have the DVD rights to Power Rangers Samurai, Super Samurai, Megaforce, and Super Megaforce. Shout! Factory did team up with Lionsgate to release Samurai, Super Samurai, and Megaforce included in the Power Rangers 20 Seasons Legacy collection. Other than that, you'll have to get the Samurai, Super Samurai, or Megaforce DVDs individually.",1398124800,13,3205,4.651943462897527
6185056,5,B00HNGC5FC,"As a kid I was always a ranger fan. I kind of grew out of it in my older years but then I realized how much I loved it and went back to watching all the older seasons as well as some of the newer ones. While these seasons are newer, they still have the awesome ranger-vibe to them that I love so much.
Each season has its own case with about 4 to 5 discs in it and each of the five cases are very nice and color coded with season title and number, the number of discs in the case, as well as a photo of one of the rangers to look awesome and it all comes in an awesome box set which looks great on your self. Included is a small book with stuff on the actors and character bios and a special features disc with all sorts of cool stuff on it like interviews of previous rangers. The cases also have the listing of episodes on the inside for extreme convenience. Love it.",1397433600,,869,3.9152542372881354

6185060,5,B00HNGC5FC,"This is my first ""Power Rangers"" box set and it is probably the one I was most looking forward to own, especially because it includes what I think is the strongest season of the franchise ever in ""RPM.""  It also includes ""Mystic Force"" and ""Operation Overdrive,"" two of my other top seasons while both ""Jungle Fury"" and ""SPD"" are solid and two of the more creatively fulfilling seasons.

But aside from having a collection of great to excellent seasons, the bonus features are a huge treat, especially getting to hear from the cast members and crew members talk about their time on the show and provide great and fun insight.

The quality of the video is also amazing. It definitely beats just streaming the episodes.  A must-have for any Power Rangers fan, but a great set to introduce a new generation to some great and fun television.",1396569600,6,837,4.673469387755102

6185062,4,B00HNGC5FC,"For some reason I have been on this kick lately of finding some of my old fave shows and movies from when I was a kid so when so there were box dvd sets of power rangers I had to put them on my wish list/get list. I was 5 when mighty morphin power rangers came out and I will admit I would watch episodes of the later seasons in my teens on wkends and still do, sometimes. Though I will admit the later seasons don't get my attention and just seem a bit disconnected and not up to what the original power rangers seasons were. so will admit I might not get any more box sets after this one, I know the collection won't be complete but after these seasons the series just doesn't seem to work anymore,",1395014400,,700,4.043165467625899

8633703,5,B00HNGC5FC,"Even as an on-again and off-again Power Rangers fan who occasionally watched the show once Disney acquired it and moved production to New Zealand, I thought the results more often hit pay dirt. Even the weaker seasons by Bruce Kalish had something new to offer -- in fact, four out of five of the seasons (SPD - Jungle Fury) was produced by him. For me, SPD is his strongest Power Ranger season due to the mostly Canadian-based cast (who can forget Bridge's 'it's buttery' catchphrase?) and the world it takes place in. The other three, ""Mystic Force"", ""Operation Overdrive"" and ""Jungle Fury"" are more of a mixed bag but still offer some decent Ranger-related thrills. And even though it's not one of the best crossovers in the franchise, Overdrive's ""Once a Ranger"" (MMPR's Johnny Yong Bosch returns as Adam in the 2-part episode along with Tori, Kira, Bridge, and Xander) is a highlight. But RPM is a true highlight of the whole franchise and this set alone, with new producers behind the camera and a desire to go out on a high note. And while it has a darker tone at times, it's not afraid of being silly and poking fun at the source material either.

Inside the thickly embossed slipcase and alongside the 46-page booklet with episode and character descriptions, each season is in its own Amaray case, with episode listings on the inside cover. Given that a portion of these seasons has been released on DVD previously, the video and audio quality are identical, even though the episode count per disc is higher (about 7-8 episodes). Quality is pretty good for broadcast TV, with clear picture and stereo sound. Like the other sets, each episode has several chapters and English close-captions.

As with the other sets, there is a bonus disc solely devoted to bonus features. While not as plentiful as the past three, it's pretty substantial. There are newly shot interviews with cast and crew members about props, the legacy of the show, and the sets they worked on. There's also a featurette interviewing Ranger fans about the merchandise they own, and finally, the original DVD promos for SPD through Mystic Force are also retained.

Even though I have issues with half the seasons in this set, the whole package is attractively done. Each season is now available separately, but none of the bells and whistles in this collection. As a Ranger fan, I highly recommend this set.",1523836800,,3080,5.901345291479821
