8006857,4,B00015HVO2,"Three of these films are semi-historical and cover 30+ years in the history of MLB, from the 1919 World Series to the integration of baseball in 1947, and including the famous 1927 year in which Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs and ""Murderers Row"" dominated.

""Eight Men Out"" (1988) is about the 1919 World Series and the scandal involving the Chicago White Sox. There are lots of well known stars including Charlie Sheen, John Cusack, D.B. Sweeney, David Strathairn with Studs Terkel and John Sayles making guest appearances.

""The Pride of the Yankees"" (1942) is about Lou Gehrig, released just after his death at the age of 37. Gary Cooper plays Gehrig and Babe Ruth himself makes an appearance. The film covers the period from 1923 through 1939 when the Yankees and ""Murderers Row"" dominated the sport, although the focus of the film is the relationship between Gehrig and his wife, played by Teresa Wright.

""The Jackie Robinson Story"" (1950) is a biographical film with Robinson playing himself. The film is more of a story about Robinson than baseball, but it does cover the critical period (1947) when he became the first black player in MLB.

""Bull Durham"" (1988) is the odd man out, a fictional account of minor league baseball and a contemporary setting. While it is about baseball, the focus is on the relationship between a catcher (Kevin Costner), a pitcher (Tim Robbins) and a baseball groupie (Susan Sarandon).

This is certainly a collection that will appeal to fans of MLB. Personally my favorite baseball films include Tommy Lee Jones as ""Cobb"" (1994), the documentary ""The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg"" (1998), ""Moneyball"" (2011), and the Mantle/Maris ""61*"" (2001). ""Field of Dreams"" (1989) isn't exactly about baseball, but it surely classifies as a tribute to baseball so I'll include it too.",1346025600,2,1812,4.947368421052632
8006858,5,B00015HVO2,"Wow! Where to begin with this amazing collection of baseball classics? The price is unbelievable, the movies are timeless, and the package was actually delivered two days ahead of time. Also, The Pride of the Yankess was in black and white, which is awesome for anyone who appreciates baseball history. I ordered *61 and Bang the Drum Slowly along with this set. Needless to say, I cannot wait for the next rainy day (unless there's a game on). My only complaint is that the tabs holding the DVDs in the box were broken on two of the movies. However, there were no scatches on the discs and i'll just blame the mailman. I definitely reccommend this product to sports fans (not just baseball fans) of any age. Regardless of whether or not you have seen these movies, just buy them, you won't regret it.",1299715200,,801,4.569444444444445
8006859,5,B00015HVO2,"Some of the best baseball movies every made. I loved the old movies as well as the newer ones. Set could have included ""The Love of the Game"" or ""Field of Dreams"" but it still is a great collection.  A must for any baseball fan.",1185321600,5,228,4.066666666666666
