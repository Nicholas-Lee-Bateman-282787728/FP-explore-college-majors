3947277,4,B002LFQIL2,"The reviews for this disc seem to be on the negative side however, after watching a couple of these, I found them very enjoyable. I only saw two or three of these when they originally aired so it's like watching new episodes of The Rockford Files for me. Unlike the original series these movies rarely (if ever) get re-aired on TV so it's nice to finally be able to watch them. Although these aren't as good as the original episodes it's still great to see Rockford back in action. Like most Rockford fans, I would have prefered a four DVD set with all eight movies in packaging to match the rest of the TV box sets. However, I think Universal was fair enough releasing the first four movies on a double disc at the price of a single DVD. I was suprised Universal decided to release these at all. Now that all The Rockford Files are available on DVD lets focus all our attnetion to Warner Bros. and find out what the hold up is with releasing ""Spenser: For Hire"" on DVD!!!",1257552000,2,972,4.346153846153846
3947278,4,B002LFQIL2,"First let me say, this review is not of the company that puts out this dvd or the manner in which the dvd was released. I agree they should have all the movies together in one set and could have made it match the seasons. But, movie and music companies always leave something to be desired in how they release things so I am not gonna write a review of that. I am writing this in regards to the actual made for tv movies. I personally do not understand why everyone is talking so negatively about these movies. My personal opinion is that, anytime you add James Garner to the mix you're gonna get your money's worth. I am a collector of dvds so I am happy/proud to say that I can finally have these to complete the Rockford Collection. Although the actor is older, you don't get the feeling that they tried to underplay his age. They accept it, they broach the subject many times with humor, and all-in-all you get an actor playing his age as well as not losing any of the qualities that made the actor so memorable. there are the trademark one liners, though he does seem a bit more rough around the edges he is still the same old rockford we grew up with in the 70s and in reruns. The saddest part was that Rocky wasn't able to be in them. Anyone who is/was a fan of the show will feel as if they've lost a family member as well. The storylines are fine, and are excellent vehicles for the Rockford character. There are a few reunions (for us as well) as he is joined by Beth and Angel (throughought the course of the movies) too bad Isaac Hayes didn't show up though. That would have made it more complete. I would glady reccomend this set to anyone who has seen the series and loved it as I did. I'd support anything I can with Garner's name on it. He is a fine actor who simply made it look easy and natural. I really would have liked it released differently (one complete set) but that is a minor qualm. Just be grateful these made it to dvd. Many companies are always looking for what's new and hot and not necessarily for what is good. Garner never made a movie/series I didn't like. He was the type that could elevate the material to levels it was probably not meant to be at. Even though the set is not out yet (I have recently seen these episodes...recorded off the Hallmark channel) and will tell you you won't be disappointed if you buy these.",1256774400,174,2356,4.261160714285714
3947279,5,B002LFQIL2,"I am so excited to get these movies on DVD!!! I am a huge fan of the show (so much that I named my dog ""Rockford""). I own all six seasons of the show on DVD already and have loved the high-quality unedited versions. I have not had a chance to see these movies yet, so I am super excited to check them out! Such a great show with great writing! As far as what others are saying about costs; I do agree that Season Six was a disappointment as it was only 12 episodes and cost the same ($30+) as the other full seasons. At the time I was annoyed by the cost and the fact that I really wish they would have given us these movies than or at least some other special features. However, I am excited to see these movies and I am glad the pricing is under $20 for each half. So although I may sound like a hypocrite I do agree that DVD sets are way over priced... sometimes you just can't put a price on something so great like The Rockford Files! Great Acting, Awesome Writing, Nice Directing (something that is almost impossible to find now-a-days) and overall one of the best shows ever produced!",1250640000,14,1091,4.150943396226415
3947280,3,B002LFQIL2,"I believe the original 1970's television series ""The Rockford Files"" was one of the finest drama series ever made.  This was largely on the strength of the performance of James Garner in the starring role, in addition to the fine scripts by people like Steven Cannell, David Chase and others. Garner NEVER put in a bad performance, something that few actors of even the most successfull series can say.  The stories, both those that had more comic aspects (such as those with the unforgettable character Angel, played by Stuart Margolin) or those with a more serious storyline always kept the attention of the audience and provided top entertainment.  Few other series can say this.

HAVING SAID THIS, I am afraid that I can not wholeheartedly recommend the movies that made up the revival of the series in the 1990's.  These movies fell victim to the common problem of all revivals using a famous older star. Whether or not they are concious of it or not,  they are being paid a fortune, they have nothing to prove, they usually don't have the energy they had when they were young,  and they know that the show can not be made without them.  This almost inevitably has the actor ease up and it frequently seems that they are simply going through the motions. Unfortunately we see this syndrome in these movies. As fine an actor as Garner was in his glory days, by the time these movies came along, he simply was not the same man.  In addition, the nature of television had changed between the 1970's and 1990's.  The 1970's had directing oriented towards a ""natural"" feel regarding lighting, sets, camera angles and such.  In the 1990's there is something more of a ""surreal"" feeling in which rather unnatural lighting is used and the furnishing of the sets seems sterile compared to that of the earlier period, which I personally don't care for.  Also, because of changing taste, things like profanity and explicit talk about sex became more accepted and this is often used as an out for lazy writers who don't have to work hard in order to make more creative stories, relying simply on the decreasing shock value to hold the audience's attention.
It is also sad to see fine supporting actors such as Joe Santos and Pat Finley (Jim's pal Dennis Becker and his wife, Peggy) who were so dynamic in the original series seemingly becoming aging relics. James Luisi, who was so good as Rockford's nemesis Lt. Chapman in the LAPD here appears as simply a goofy caricature.

The bottom line is that these movies are yet another proof of Thomas Wolfe's immortal line ""You Can't Go Home Again"".",1250467200,42,2587,4.709534368070954
3947281,1,B002LFQIL2,"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer that this is just another shameful venture in order to milk the public out of as much money as the distributors can in order to get this product out. As fond as I am of the series (and the movies), I will not be buying these to supplement my series collection.  I have an exhaustive collection and these additons just are not that necessary.  Maybe someday I'll find them in a cheap used bin somewhere and buy them.  Or wait until a ""Complete Movies"" volume shows up at a reasonable price.",1250467200,14,538,4.414141414141414

3947395,5,B002LFQIL2,"The Rockford Files began with the pilot episode ""Backlash of the Hunter"" broadcast March 27, 1974. It worked for NBC and James Garner as ""Private Investigator, Jim Rockford"" returned for the tv series, ""The Rockford Files"" (1974-80).  The series ended on Season 6 due to James Garner's illness. Garner was real sorry to see the tv series end. However, NBC had an idea in 1994, 14 years later, they brought back James Garner as executive producer to play ""Jim Rockford"" again in what would become 8 tv-movies from 1994-1999. Joe Santos and Stuart Margolin also returned.

The reviews at the end on the comments tell the story: The TV movies attempts were half-hearted, weak casting for most character actors, and even Angel's (The great E.A. Martin) performances were phoned-in.  There are some good moments, but too few.  Like Richard Romanus as P.I. Penguinette, and the late Victor Aaron as hitman ""Mr. Pinetree.""  Romanus appeared only once in the TV series - definitely a lost opportunity to expand on his character.

3947459,5,B002LFQIL2,"Like most of the reviewers I have a very positive opinion of the Rockford Files and everything that came out of that series.

The movies were extensions of the series and completely believable and better, amusing or flat out funny. There were times when I would driving in the LA area in the 70s (I'd moved there in 1977) and just by chance, there would be the Rockford crew, shooting on location! ONE major result of the merger in my mind of the Rockford Files and my entry into LA is that seeing the series episodes is like traveling in time back to that era... pretty amazing experiences are bottled up on the DVDs.

I'm in the process of re-collecting the series (like many of the other reviewers, before the DVD sets were released, I recorded all the episodes and the movies on tape.) The movies are next.

Two final comments: Garner recently released an autobiography (assisted) that I found fascinating, about how he found himself on TV and movies, how the two major TV series, Rockford Files and Maverick (NOW finally on DVDs as well, I bought the Columbia House Maverick collection in the 90s, 25 tapes for $25 each) were developed and how things in his portion of Hollywood worked [his comment about Hollywood was pointed: ""Of course here, people will lie to you... even when they don't need to.""], also about how uncomfortable he has been speaking in public; I'd suggest that you sample Maverick as well, it's hard to believe that he was only 30 when that series started, with only modest acting experience, it's like watching the birth of a major star.",1366243200,3,1564,4.6389891696750905

  Having said that I would recommend any hard core Rockford fan to get these movies.  The portrayal of Jim Rockford by James Garner is a masterpiece of acting.
""Rocky"" has died and Jimbo is on his own, except for his good friends Dennis Becker,
Beth, and Angel.  Jim is kind of a loner, but he is dragged into life by his occupation and loyalty to friends.  When his dad is mentioned you can see the emotion from all the actors for fellow actor Noah Beery, Jr. come through their eyes and voice.  But Jim is still Jim.  The walk is a little more limping and slower, the reaction time is slowed, even the music is a little slower, but it is still the same old Jim Rockford. When he should be in someother line of work, and age is starting to take its effect, Jim is still in there, slugging it out for the little guy who never gets a break or justice.  The feel of the movies is the 1990's and you can see a little bit that Jim is a little out of touch with the cultural changes that took place over the last 15 years.  But it is fun to watch him still coping.
  So here is to the 1990's and to James Garner, who is in retirement, but still going strong.  I hope Jim Rockford is still around also.",1311120000,9,1426,4.138181818181818

3947494,4,B002LFQIL2,"Granted Garner was older when these movies were made, so one has to expect his age to show. And, it does. There is not as much action as in the TV series and only one car chase in all four movies. But, the Firebird is back and so is Rockford in these movies. His wit, charm and swagger is all there. I only gave it four stars due to the half package. I believe that all 8 movies should have been released together, blame that on studio greed. The stories are well written, a couple written by Stephen J. Cannel himself even. The first movie does more of an omage to the Firebird, but by the second movie it's back and being driven by Rockford. Rocky is gone, I guess Noah Berry had passed by the time these movies were made. He is missed and the shows are lacking from his not being there. In the first two movies Rockford talks on the phone to Rocky, but you only hear Rockford not Rocky's side of the conversation. There is a picture of Rocky on Rockford's desk to remind us of his presence in the series. The movies never pick up that full force tornado that Jim Rockford was in the series but then he is older here and it shows. Angel is in all of the four movies, as always he is well, he's Angel, the sell his own mother for a buck lovable UN-trustable  fool as he was in the series. Lieutenant Becker is in all four movies, he plays the part well as always.

All in all these movies are good, they bring us more Jim Rockford, no longer at his best as he is aged, but a little older a little wiser, a lot less athletic than he was but Jim Rockford non-the-less.

They are a follow-up to the original 6 seasons of the TV show. Garner's knee and back problems, which resulted from his insistence on performing most of his own stunts, especially those involving fist fights and car chases, caused him excruciating physical pain, and he opted not to continue with the show, and NBC canceled the program in mid-season.

It took 14 years for the ill will between his production company and the network to subside, during which time a decade-long lawsuit over profits was finally settled in his favor.

So beginning in the mid-1990s eight movies were produced. Its great to see Lt. Becker and Angel again in these movies.

Video quality is very high. The image is clean, colors are true. It looks better than we all saw when broadcast.

Note for fans: Not many actual location sets from 70s shows still exist, but the Sandcastle restaurant is still there on the beach in Malibu (and the food is high quality). Rockford's trailer no longer sits at the end of the parking lot, but its really cool to walk over and stand where it was!

""I Still Love L.A."" (1994) - Jim is trying to leave California behind him when a series of natural disasters, the L. A. riots and the murder of a wealthy mother make it impossible for him to go. Joanna Cassidy guest stars. Dedicated to Noah ""Rocky Rockford"" Berry, who passed away 3 weeks before it aired. He was too ill to be in the movie.

""A Blessing In Disguise"" (1995) - an old friend is up to a dangerous new trick when Jim catches Angel preaching from the pulpit of the Temple of Holy Light church, whose members have put the life of a young actress at risk.

""If The Frame Fits"" (1996) - It's up to Jim to clear his own name when he becomes the primary suspect in the death of a rival P.I. and the police, FBI and a Latino gang all want to get their hands on him. Rocky's death is addressed. The giant mural seen in this episode is still there: Victor Clothing Company, 242 South Broadway. Guest star: Dyan Cannon.

""Godfather Knows Best"" (1996) - Family duty calls when Jim must come to the aid of his troubled godson, who is accused of murdering a high-profile fashion designer. Dan Lauria guest stars.",1278633600,108,2633,4.50104821802935

Now that they are available on DVD I had to get them. I have been a Rockford fan since the 70's (they came aired on TV when I was thirteen).  The made-for-TV-movies are true to the original series.  Jim has the same crummy cases that hardly pay and everything he owns is needs to be fixed.  I think that is oner reason I liked the series so much...it is like all of our lives. Unlike Magnum who lived on an estate in Hawaii and drove a red Ferrari (good luck tailing anyone incognito in that machine) Jim Rockford lives in an old trailer parked in a restaurant parking lot by the beach and has to keep repairing his Firebird (pretty much a stock auto off the lot). Jim is a realist that still holds to his moral values. He is slightly jaded (you would be jaded to if you pulled five years in prison on a frame) but he has a good heart and still believes in humanity's basic goodness. He is not naieve and has the street smarts to function as a private investigator. Jim tries to avoid fights but does swing a fist when he needs to (invariably in self-defence).  He is no weenie and has used a gun when necessary (we all have a right to protect ourselves and loved ones with firearms should the need arise) but does not play the typical ""gun show commando.""

3947517,5,B002LFQIL2,"I've been waiting almost a decade for this! I have my own set, recording on the DVDR, editing out commercials, etc but still didn't perfectly get every commercial cut out or release the pause in time. I don't know why all 7 weren't released together but imagine it's the whole legalities / dick slapping on the table / who has the rights to this and that nonsense. I remember an interview with Mr. Garner after the first movie where he stated that Rockford was one of his favorite characters and alot of himself was in Rockford. He said that, while approached many times with the prospect of reviving the character there had to be the right scripts as he didn't want to tarnish the integrity of the series. He said the timing was right and, at 66, if he didn't do it then he really would have been too old to do it.

I believe the scripts were good and Mr. Garner was incredible as well as the supporting cast. It says alot about Mr. Garner as a person and actor that many of the original supporting cast as well as writers and staff participated, some coming out of retirement to do so.

I have shared my thoughts on many things from music to movies, etc however, if anyone ever listened to a nobody like me I hope this review is taken in the respectful spirit it is intended. While meeting Mr. Garner just to shake his hand and thank him for the many hours growing up watching him, almost in some ways using his character as a role model, buy this and enjoy it for the wit and skill in writing and acting that seems to have been lost in a world of special effects and how many things can be blown up over skill. I anxiously await the remainder of the movies being released, maybe we'll even get the bonus of a movie not released or some great gag reel footage.

A shame the world can't be simplified to what it was when the original series ran and gas was 69 cents a gallon. these movies open a window in the 90's of a simpler time. God bless Mr. Garner and the fine writers for these movies!!!

3947520,3,B002LFQIL2,"When asked in 1999 by an interviewer with the Museum of Television & Radio whether he intended to continue making Rockford movies, James Garner chuckled and said ""No one needs a 71-year-old private investigator.""  I think that says it all.  These 1990's Rockford films have all the punch of a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation.  Remember that while they were produced by the original Rockford studio, Universal, they aired on CBS, which in the 90's produced some of the tamest, lamest television of all time.  The plot lines here are feeble, and the characters are parodies of themselves (especially Angel).  They are not the classic works by Stephen J Cannell and David Chase. What these films do, however, is answer the questions that I had up until the point they were produced: ""What would Rockford be doing now and how would he react to current events ie: floods, wildfires, riots etc.?)  Now we know.  The physical stunts (falling down a mountainside, punching people etc.) were believable in the 1970's when James Garner was fit as a fiddle and nearing 50. But they were just plain silly in the 90's when he was nearing 70.  This was why Barnaby Jones was so rediculous!  Ironically, Peter Falk was reprising his Columbo role for ABC about this time and was superb.  But that's because Columbo was more cerebral, and less physical, and thus a perfect match for a man of 49 or 89!

As for the packaging, I too would have rather seen these movies boxed into one set... for a litle more money.  Stringing them out into two sets seems absurd, since it's likely that only diehard fans will return for volume two.",1257638400,16,1615,4.708185053380783

8373008,5,B002LFQIL2,"Wonderful quality for DVD. I was a little concerned the flaws would be more noticeable with a 65"" UHD TV and a BD player, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, the upconversion technology of the player is part and parcel but Universal still did a bang-up job on the transfer. Lately it has been hit-or-miss with Universal but this one, they hit out of the park. Despite not being wide screen, the video was as clear as can be expected, plus some.

Audio is top-notch too!

The movies had the same warmth and humor Rockford fans have come to expect. Since I had never seen these movies, it was a first for me.  These are as much fun as the series. Sure miss James Garner and Noah Beery.  But, all good things...  If you are on the fence about these, I hope this helps.",1515974400,,767,4.298611111111111
