******

This film is about a rag-tag bunch of barely-basketball players (with one superstar) who somehow defeat a whole team of players who are primed for success in the NBA. They meet in the championship game of the March Madness competition, and the underdog ragtag team of players wins the game in a dazzling and exciting college basketball game that if it were real, would be remembered for eternity.

Even though the film is told in hyper-real style (with accurate-to-the-minute sports announcing and everything), the film is not really believable on the whole. First of all, the rag-tag underdog team is Kansas University--seriously? Aren't they like in the top 10 every year? Since when are they underdogs?! There's also their main character, the superstar player, ""Danny Manning""--supposedly he's 6-feet-10, but there's no way he could move so quickly if he were really that tall! Then there's all these underdog players that somehow do really well. This guy named ""Milt Newton"" didn't even miss a shot (unrealistic)! And then there's this ""Clint Normore"" guy who supposedly was just a football player who was like, bored, or something and joined the team just because they needed more players (since when does Kansas need more players?!)--and he scored his ""career high"", including a total prayer three-pointer!

To top it all off, the ""sports announcers"" make a big deal about it being the fictitious ""50th NCAA Basketball Tournament"" and then what do you know--the score at the half? Tied 50 to 50. Come on! That one really took the cake.

Realism aside, though, it's a great movie, and one of the best basketball games one could ever see (if only it were a real game!). I heartily recommend this one for fans of basketball movies.",1395619200,2,1823,4.983552631578948
8218496,4,B000VEA3JI,Tried in two different brand Blu ray players and the picture will freeze momentarily then play.  Does this consistently.  Dug out my older DVD player and the discs work great.  Very exciting games and worth watching.  I had never seen them before so I'm glad I bought the dvd.,1340755200,,276,4.571428571428571
