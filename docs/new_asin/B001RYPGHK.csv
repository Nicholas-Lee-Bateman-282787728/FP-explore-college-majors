8339264,5,B001RYPGHK,"I myself have a disability that allows me to stand, but not for long periods of time and I am not very flexible. So when I was given a recommendation for yoga for exercise I did not like that most yoga programs were aimed at able-bodied people that can stand for long periods of time and could do all the poses. This nice DVD is very much for people like myself. It is a very relaxing, not strenuous workout. My only complaint is that I wish there were more exercise sets on the DVD.",1370131200,,483,4.148936170212766
