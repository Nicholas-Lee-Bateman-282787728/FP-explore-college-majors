2811861,5,B000P6R5NO,"I had a presentation due about terrorism during the Civil War which turned out difficult and very time consuming to research. This video was a great help! It gives specific names, dates, and locations of events which helped me research further. I think this video would help someone of almost any age.",1239408000,15,301,4.8076923076923075
2811862,5,B000P6R5NO,"Civil War Terror produced by the History Channel is an excellent DVD covering the late Civil War (1843-45) from the Dahlgren Raid through the sinking of the Sultana. Terror is not a new tactic as this DVD plainly testifies. Any student of the Civil War must be familiar with this topic if they are to have a complete picture of how uncivil the Civil War was. War is never a thing of glory, espcially when it touches the lives of the common people. In this, the Civil War was no different than any other.",1193097600,14,503,4.361702127659575

8189311,5,B000P6R5NO,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,,367,4.447761194029851
8189312,5,B000P6R5NO,"Choose this rating because I loved it. After reading so much about civil war in school, watching this helped to bring everything full circle for me to write an outstanding paper from a particular point of view with an A I might add.  Thanks",1386979200,,240,4.454545454545454
8189313,5,B000P6R5NO,"This opened my eyes to things I did not know about the Civil War. Things like they used the term ""weapons of mass destruction"". Really! I watched the documentary on the History Channel I had to buy it for my children and grandchildren to watch. Simply fascinating!",1352851200,,264,4.638297872340425
8189314,5,B000P6R5NO,It is incredible how little has been revealed of the terrors and horrors which occurred during this conflict.  It is high time this important part of our history was brought to light so people will know ALL that happened during this terrible conflict.,1332460800,,251,4.837209302325581
8189315,1,B000P6R5NO,"From jayhawkers to Montgomery, to Sheridan to Sherman there are enough wars crimes to fill a DVD library so what what does this ""historical"" video focus on? The South. Once again we just cannot seem to escape the propaganda of the victor. And once again if you want a good overview you will have to pick up a book. Start with ""War Crimes Against Southern Civilians"", a collection of essays that will leave you shaking you head, and explain why the bitterness in the South ran so deep for so long. That is, if you can HANDLE the truth!",1324425600,5,534,4.404040404040404
8189316,4,B000P6R5NO,"The biggest drawback to CIVIL WAR TERROR, a History Channel production, is that it focuses almost entirely on sub rosa Confederate terror tactics and slights similar efforts by Union forces. Most of the Union actions presented are well-known episodes, such as Sherman's March to the Sea.

Still, it is a well-made reenactment documentary that brings to light a little-known portion of American history. Of particular note are the corresponding Blue and Gray plots to kill Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln. Also, there is the postwar loss by explosion of the ""Sultana"", a Mississippi riverboat carrying 2400 repatriated Union soldiers. 1800 were lost, making the ""Sultana"" a greater tragedy than the ""Titanic."" The show posits (quite convincingly) that the explosion was caused by holdout Confederate saboteurs, and not, as long believed, by a mechanical boiler failure.

Whatever you may think, this program illustrates well that terrorism has a long and dishonorable history as an instrument of policy and war.",1307923200,2,1014,5.4113924050632916
8189317,4,B000P6R5NO,This was very interesting and makes the antics of the Civil War seem like today's terrorism.,1269129600,3,92,4.8125
