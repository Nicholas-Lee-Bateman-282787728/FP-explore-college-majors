8270759,5,B0018QUL22,"I owned the DVD of this VCR Tape and lent it to a former workmate, who is unable to walk owing to a medical error, but he can wriggle his toes, move his knees etc. and is seeing some progress in mobility with the help of this DVD.  So: well done, to me, for parting with my beloved DVD.

Next step:  go on Amazon and purchase a replacement - unfortunately and unwittingly I bought a tape, so I need to either return it or have it converted.  I'll probably go for the conversion option; it's quicker than the return and re-order method all the way from the U.S. of A. - also:  I am not certain that precisely this version, which is the same I owned, is available on DVD.

On the contents:  I find the presentation of Dr Roger Jahnke very easy to follow; the movements make a lot of sense, his gentle instructions are easy to follow and his voice is meditative and soothing without being boring; a pleasant baritone/tenor voice with a slight Canadian accent.  My daughter also teaches Qigong and is doing a great job too, but Roger's instructions and 'exercises' if one can call them that are divided up into various sections from which you can pick and you don't have to do the complete DVD/tape and still have some benefit from the meditative exercises which actually do move the breath of life into your body and one feels relaxed, loose and amazingly fit and 'healthy' afterwards ; I think Qigong will be with me for the remainder of my life.
You can also see Dr Jahnke on various U-tube videos, which are all worthwhile viewing.
What a simple way to remain healthy; thankyou Dr. Jahnke!",1417478400,6,1590,4.424657534246576
