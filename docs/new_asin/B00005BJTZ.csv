7937650,5,B00005BJTZ,The first time I saw this was many years ago on Public Television under the title The Fogbound Bus. I thought I'd never get to see it again and was very pleased to be able to obtain a copy. I enjoy watching it as much as ever.,1241136000,2,226,3.8297872340425534
7937651,1,B00005BJTZ,"This is a gem of a movie. Having seen it years ago, I was thrilled to find that it is finally available on DVD. Five stars for the movie. No stars, however, for this DVD. I was expecting a clear, hopefully letterboxed, DVD along the lines of the wonderful Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple DVD's. This DVD presents a barely visable picture - murky and blurry. A major disappointment. Please don't miss an opportunity to see this film, but don't bother with this disaster of a DVD, since you won't be able to see the film.

I wish that I had heeded Mr. Murphy's review which is 100% accurate.",1198454400,16,589,4.453703703703703
7937652,4,B00005BJTZ,"Film wise this is a film I have loved since childhood, Frankie Howerd's comedy is spot on hilarious and has great charm.

Wham America has used the exact same print released in the UK by Pickwick.  This has one of the worst and laziest picture quality I have seen yet.  The picture is un-watchable to be blunt, no attempt has been made to clean this print up at all.",1190332800,18,366,4.27536231884058
7937653,5,B00005BJTZ,The beautiful magnificent singer Petula Clark rules in this great british comedy. It's a must see!!!,1102377600,4,100,5.3125
