2926687,4,B000UX6TIY,"Before South Park and Jon Stewart there was Dr. Katz.  This isn't a review of the show because there aren't enough stars to relate how brilliant this show is and, if you are reading this review, you probably already know about the show so I don't need to explain it to you.  This is a review of the DVD boxed set.

Some are going to be put off by the cost and the requirement to buy all of the seasons at once.  Like many other die-hard fans, I already own seasons 1 and 2, so I had to buy them again in order to get all of the seasons.  That said, I'm actually happy that they did this for two reasons: 1) I didn't want to be constantly waiting for the next season to come out, hoping that they didn't stop due to lack of interest, and 2) because this probably works out to be cheaper in the end (especially if you didn't buy the first two seasons already).

The actual DVD quality is good, although the audio levels seem to go higher and lower between episodes.  It is barely noticeable and shouldn't effect your viewing.

The only real negative is that they did seem to skimp on the commentary and extras this time around.  They've added a booklet, but everything else was already available on the first two season DVDs.  I can understand that, since it is a show that is probably not remembered by too many people other than the hardcore fans, but I was hoping for a bit more.

Regardless, it's great to finally have all of these episodes on DVD.  Thank you, Comedy Central!",1195862400,6,1478,4.276978417266187
2926688,5,B000UX6TIY,"I won't be able to give a fair review because this is probably my favorite television show ever. I will just say that if you ever liked the show, it is worth buying the series. I promise you it is as good (if not better) than you remembered it and there is nothing on television that is quite like it or has the style of humor that made this show special.",1195603200,3,355,4.014084507042254

2926692,4,B000UX6TIY,"This is one of the funniest series born of American television, in my opinion, and I will certainly purchase this SOME day.

HOWEVER: As another reviewer has written, I've already bought Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD, and it's a manageable purchase for $15-20 per set. But now, to have Seasons 3-6, I will have to purchase the first two seasons AGAIN. And the purchase price (while certainly competitive for the number of discs involved), is a power of 10 higher than I usually put out for DVD entertainment. So that's a bit of a letdown.",1188172800,33,531,4.53125

2926694,5,B000UX6TIY,"I remember watching this show late at night with my college roommates and laughing hysterically.  Over the past few years, I have been looking for it.  I was happy with the first two seasons coming out of DVD and caught a few episodes on Comedy Central ""On Demand"" through my cable.  I was not disappointed.  It is still hilarious.  It looked to be in jeopardy of being shelved, but thankfully the full-set is coming.
For anyone wondering, the animation is crude, bordering on annoying.  But that isn't the selling point.  It could be a radio show and it would be hilarious.  About 1/2 of the show takes place in Dr. Katz's office as he has therapy sessions with well known stand-up comedians.  Most of it is them doing some of their stand-up material and Dr. Katz reacting.  This is the most hit or miss part of the show for me.  75% of the comedians are funny.  Big names too.  Ray Romano, Dave Chappelle, Jon Stewart, Wanda Sykes, Sarah Silverman, etc.  The part of the show that never missed for me was the storyline surrounding Ben Katz.  Perhaps my favorite character of all time on television.  He never misses.  He makes me laugh every episode.  His interactions with Dr.l Katz, Laura (the receptionist), and anyone else he encounters are very funny.",1187654400,48,1258,4.640909090909091

2926738,5,B000UX6TIY,"I remember watching a few episodes of Dr. Katz back in the 90's and thinking, ""Damn this is one funny show!!""  And here I am over 20 years later thinking, ""Damn this is such a funny show!  They don't make shows like this anymore!  I'm so glad to be able to rediscover its genius!""  As a much older person now, I can definitely appreciate the nuances, uniqueness, and genius of this show, from the hilarious comedians as patients, Dr. Katz himself, his friends at the bar, to the very creatively executed animation that gave a visual to the completely funny dialogue between the comedian patients and Dr. Katz, between Ben and Dr. Katz, between Ben and everyone else, and all the rest of the dialogue in the show.  I love how they always drew Ben with mismatching socks and would sometimes draw him clutching his favorite childhood toy named Bully.  All the details that the animators included in drawing the visuals for this show are absolutely hilarious and so creative!  I'm really glad that this show is still available to order on DVD over 20 years later!  I'm so glad I purchased my Dr. Katz Complete Series and am so happy with it!!!  This show is a real one-of-a-kind!!",1450828800,4,1176,4.588516746411483

2926744,5,B000UX6TIY,"Amazing show. So many comedians! Great voices for the characters including Dr Katz, Ben, and Laura. Very enjoyable. The cartoon art is so goofy, you end up loving it's charm. There are several lines that I will remember forever, especially things that Dom Irrera says - he is hilarious as a patient in this show. Ray Romano also is funny, but a lot of his jokes (""am i gay?!"" ""candy"") are heard in other things he has done. This show is from the 90s and so you see a lot of comedians from that time and some are still around today, so it's fun for the throwback.",1446076800,3,562,4.261682242990654

2926764,5,B000UX6TIY,"This show is the best.  The crazy comedians have me LMBO!  My favorite is Dom Irrera. he is pretty regular visitor to the show.  With him describing  wildly homoerotic situations then asking Doctor Katz, ""does that make me gay?"" He asked Dr Katz to marry him and nothing gay, it would just be 2 guys spooning in a bed and sharing their lives and expenses.  Asking the question ""That doesn't make me gay does it?""  His receptionist Laura is exactly as his never do well lazy child like son Ben said "" a big bag O b****h"" And Ben is so funny and makes anyone grateful that their son is soooo much better!  Dr Katz reminds me of Bob Newhart's Dr Hartley.  He was made to be the straight man and that in itself makes me very funny. The thing is the squigglevision it is animated with.  It looks like they all are having seizures.  But it is like Beavis and Butthead continual laughing you have to filter that out.  One time I forgot about filtering and I got the giggles watching the incessant shaking.

2926766,5,B000UX6TIY,"I never missed this quirky series when it was on Comedy Central. I love stand-up comedy and animation, and considering that this show was invented before adult-swim shows how innovated it was for the time. I didn't know it was available six years ago or I would have bought it then because apart from the first and second seasons being available separately, you can't buy the other four the same way.",1385769600,,400,4.647887323943662

The premise of presenting their ""A"" material as therapy was genius. The relationship between Dr. Katz and his son, Ben, was always hilarious. H. Jon Benjamin is still my favorite voice actor (see Family Guy, Archer.) Jonathan Katz also had the greatest, dry wit.

After Ben's stuffed animal, Bully, is accidentally thrown away:
Ben: I have human friends, too.
Dr. Katz: Well, would you keep them in the linen closet?

2926783,4,B000UX6TIY,"Because I never cared for the ""squigglevision"" animation, I avoided this show literally for years.  It was only from seeing various clips of the series featuring Steven Wright and Emo Philips that I decided to give the show a second look.  I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed the core material and central characters, especially Laura Silverman.  The single best episode in terms of the central characters and their quirky dysfunctions was ""Mask"" where, halfway through the show Dr. Katz's deadbeat son Ben finally remembers the nightmare he had a day or two before.  Oh my God, I could not believe the conversation that ensued!  You won't find that episode anywhere but here on the complete series of the show.

One of the weaknesses, however, is that too many of the guest comedians simply used Dr. Katz's couch as a platform for their shtick.  The comedians that approached this concept in the manner it deserved not only made their respective episode(s) great, they won over audience that they might not have won over otherwise.  The best guest comedians were Emo Philips, Steven Wright, and the incredible Dom Irrera!  The latter made more appearances than any other comedian and, yet, I never tired of his contributions because he did not treat the couch as just another gig.  I suppose it also doesn't help much that I absolutely, positively loath Ray Romano.  Thank God he finally stop showing up for his appointments because, quite frankly, there is no helping him!

All in all, this is a very good purchase.  At times it's mixed bag, but when it is on it is really on.  If you don't believe, just watch ""Mask"" from season four.",1316044800,7,1644,4.763250883392226

2926785,4,B000UX6TIY,"I'd been thinking about buying this collection for some time. It was a show I remembered well from the 90s that both my son and I loved at the time.

Sometimes when you revisit and old favourite it can be a disappointment. What you remember as hilarious doesn't even raise a titter anymore. Thankfully, that wasn't the case with Dr Katz. It is as fresh, funny and relevant today as it was when I first saw it in the 90s.

Each episode features two or three leading comedians as Dr Katz's clients. Some of the patients have gone on to illustrious careers since the series was first showm. Joy Behar, Ray Romano, Conan O'Brien, Louis C. K., Patton Oswalt and many, many more. All brilliant, all funny. The other regulars are genius too. Dr Katz's son Ben reminds me so much of my own son. Laura the secretary is played brilliantly by Laura Silverman, sister of Sarah.

The collection is so comprehensive that I haven't yet had time to watch all 13 discs, but so far it has been comedy gold. My only complaints being that this is in US region, so not easy to play in Australia, and that three episodes on one disc appear to be unplayable. Hopefully the remainder will be fine. It was only the inability to play these episodes that stopped me from giving this purchase the highhest rating.

If you are a fan of this show, this collection is worth it. It is a little light on the extras, but the main show is there and that is enough for me. If I have a complaint about this, it would be that the (very cool) packaging is very difficult to replace if broken. I know this should be a given, but be very gentle with this. My box set slid off of something about 3 ft high and landed on carpet (carpet!) and split the discs right at the 6 and 7. That was the only casualty though, so I am grateful. But I have yet to find a suitable replacement case. Oh Well.
The book that accompanies this collection is a good read also. Dr Katz is just too funny for me and it was so cool to see the cast reunite on Home Movies, albeit for a few episodes.

2926797,5,B000UX6TIY,"If you've never seen this show, it's hard to describe because it's really in a class by itslef. (OK, Home Movies is in the same class, but it's made by the same production company.) It's mostly about witty dialog that you can't believe no one ever thought of before, just when you thought that the Simpsons and Seinfeld had done it all.

The weak part of the show is the hit or miss stand-up performed by various comedians (as Dr Katz' patients), but it's easy enough to skip over the not-so-funny. Regulars like Ray Romano and Dom Irrera provide lots of great material.

Yes, they released the complete series after releasing the first two seasons. And it doesn't appear that they added any additional commentary in seasons 3 and beyond. One great extra is a one-hour live version of the show the cast performed live in 2007. Not as funny as the regular show, but still better than most stuff you'll see on tv. Unfortunately, Katz' guest patients wouldn't shut up long enough for him to interject anything funny. Especially the ever annoying Kathy Griffin.",1231372800,,1057,4.708108108108108

2926802,5,B000UX6TIY,"Dr Katz was a fresh step for Comedy Central to take in the mid-nineties. Lightweight plots, read by improv actors, surrounding a premise to parade current stand-up comedians' best bits as cofessions from a psychoanalyst's couch. All displayed with a gradeschool-crayon-type squiggly animation style that belies the depth of the comedy.

I laughed hysterically with the show whenever I could catch it in it's original run. And I kept up with the VHS and DVDs as they were released peicemeal. So I was ecstatic when I heard of this set; the entire series in one DVD collection. It has already become a constant in our DVD changer, throwing it on whenever my family needs a wind-down with a good laugh, or even a happy atmospheric hum in the background of reading, chatting, or browsing online.

I would recommend this for all fans of stand-up, especially fans of the many, many comedians who grace the show, including  Ray Romano, Kevin Meany, Joy Behar, Jim Gaffigan, and some especially memorable turns by Dom Irrera, and around hundred others! Enjoy!",1213315200,3,1051,4.926553672316384
2926803,4,B000UX6TIY,"This is the best comedy show of the early '90's that most people have never heard of! It's one of my favorite comedy shows of all time. The interplay between Dr. Katz, his son Ben, and his receptionist Laura ranges from humorous to side-splitting. His ""patients"" are all comedians of the time, and are all hilarious -- some better than others, but all great.

My one complaint about this set is the visual quality. I had most of the shows home-recorded on VHS tapes at the lowest-quality setting. Nevertheless, the quality of those VHS tapes was substantially better than on these DVDs. I'm not a video expert, but the ""squiggle-vision"" which seemed fine on the broadcasts in the 90's (analog?) has been digitized on these DVDs at a low resolution. The viewer is constantly aware of very large black pixels that keep moving around the character's outlines. These episodes should have been digitized at twice the resolution -- the pixels would be smaller and the overall effect wouldn't be so distracting.

However, I'm a huge fan of Dr. Katz, and this set is worth it. My brain can come to ignore the poor pixelation and just take in the show itself.  And If they ever decide to come out with a better quality set in the future, I'll probably buy that as a replacement.",1212192000,14,1269,4.65625

2926805,5,B000UX6TIY,"This DVD set is well designed.  All the disks are stored in a single case that's easy to flip through.  Each season is split into 2 DVDs of 6-7 episodes each and the seasons have matching colors. The complete series DVDs don't have the obnoxious advertisements that you had to skip through before the menu in the previously released DVDs.

The menus are fairly easy to navigate and provide the names of the comedians and air date of each episode.  The video looks good in either widescreen or 4x3 aspects (to me anyway) and none of the image is cut off in either aspect.  I can't tell if that's due to the original format or anamorphic formatting on the DVD, but it seems to work.

The only nit I have to pick, and it's a small one, is that they may have purposefully split each season to two disks to jack up the price but it's not enough of a drawback to drop a star.

Regarding the show itself, it had been a while since I'd seen the last episodes and I was pleased that the show was pretty consistent from season-to-season.  Some additional background music and transition scenes are mixed in around the 4th-5th seasons and some color creeps into the original b&w backgrounds, but the style of dialogue remains about the same which is impressive over so many seasons.",1209772800,18,1271,4.471861471861472

2926811,5,B000UX6TIY,"Of course this is a great show, but my comment is more about DVD releases and Amazon. I've figured out along with others, it is best to wait until these complete box sets comes out and skip buying individual seasons. I also had Dr. Katz Season 1 and 2, and sold them sealed over the summer, along with my sealed Seinfelds, Andy Griffiths, King of Queens and Frasier, which all had Complete Series Sets come out in 2007. Most of the time the sets are cheaper than buying them individually. I bought the Dr. Katz Complete Series a month ago from Amazon when it was offered for $52.00. Since that time it increased to $84.00, and now it is $118.00. Amazon bounces the price around quite a bit on their DVDs so keep checking back. I saw Andy Griffith Series go from $140.00 to $205.00 then back to $140.00. I assume it is an availablility thing. I have learned to relax a bit when DVDs come out...it's easy to get excited and buy everything as it is released, like I did. Patience is the key...I'm sure Dr. Katz would agree.",1198022400,9,1020,4.373684210526315
2926812,5,B000UX6TIY,"This series with Jonathan Katz combines the visual animated comedy with the written and audio comedy into a mixture that is unique and digestable at the same time. The pacing is comfortable too. As a viewer I feel I can follow everything along smoothly. Nevertheless, they throw in unexpected lines and rejoinders in the dialogs that keep it fresh and twinkly.

The variety of the show is very wide with all the different comedians who take the couch. They created many atypical situations in the office with the various patients including patients lying on the top of the couch, playing musical instruments or claiming Dr. Katz as the cause of their problems. You may not see these variations at a regular therapist's office.

This series offers little lessons on how two people, such as Dr. Katz and his son Ben, can run into a lot of snags but still find ways to accept each other in an emoting, yet humorous process.",1197849600,3,920,4.708074534161491
