8056364,5,B0008JII3O,"Perhaps the most emotional of Angelopoulos' films so far. While it occasionally flirts with melodrama, it's ultimately heartbreaking while losing none of the film-maker's usual formal rigor and visual beauty. A couple try to find a way to stay together in the face of wars, both civil and international, as well as fighting small town prejudice and rejection. Not an easy film, and some of the history may be confusing unless you happen to be up on the history of Greece in the 20th century (I'll admit I'm not), but very worth the time and effort.

As with most of Angelopoulos' films, the edition you want to find is the Greek 'New Star' release (it has english subtitles). This line was supervised by Angelopoulos personally, and the image is definitely a step up. The sad things is, inexplicably, those editions were only released for a short while, and they've become very hard to find.",1439078400,,891,4.785714285714286
8056365,4,B0008JII3O,"Theo Angelopoulos' penultimate work is the first part of a hugely ambitious attempt to encapsulate on film the history of Greece in the 20th century. Initially he wanted to make just the one feature, but it mushroomed into a trilogy. This is actually his fourth trilogy, but only the first where the word `Trilogia' appears officially in the title. The Weeping Meadow deals with Greece from 1919 through to 1949. Part two, The Dust of Time deals with the diaspora experience of Greek immigrants, following them across the world in the time frame 1949-2000. The final film, The Other Sea, was set to deal with Greece's economic crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, but sadly Angelopoulos was killed in a traffic accident leaving the project incomplete.

The Weeping Meadow marks the director's return to the political and historical complexity of his Trilogy of History (Days of '36, The Travelling Players, Alexander the Great) and The Hunters which he made in the 1970s. There he deploys Brechtian allegory making for a rigorous and deeply profound discussion of 20th century Greek history. Angelopoulos' focus in all his films has always been on how the country has been tragically crippled by cycles of violence - wars, socio-economic (and therefore political) unrest, foreign occupations, reoccurring Fascism and the destruction of Greek rural communities with heavy immigration to America and then later to Russia and Germany. Angelopoulos sees all these things as factors which have all but killed off Greece as a major power today with few prospects for a better future. Many describe his films as pessimistic though the director himself prefers the word `melancholic' and this is a film which could be read as a summation of his `melancholic' world view.

As in The Travelling Players, Angelopoulos builds his film out of 3 thematic layers. Instead of history, myth and theatre, we have history, myth and straight melodrama. The story centers on the return of two immigrants from Russia in 1919, named Eleni (Alexandra Aidini) and Alexis (Nikos Pousanidis). Alexis is the son of Spyros (Vassilis Kolovos) and Danae (Thalia Argirioua) while Eleni is a Greek orphan whom the family picked up in the Odessa streets as they fled the advancing Bolshevik red army. The group of returning immigrants is granted an area of land near Thessalonika by the Greek government where they build a village, calling it `Little Odessa'. As they grow up, Alexis impregnates his adopted sister and the parents are obliged to hide the birth of twins who are given up for adoption. Following the death of his wife Spyros arranges to marry Eleni himself. But the reluctant bride and Alexis run away, taking refuge with Nikos (Giorgos Armenis) and his band of travelling musicians in an abandoned theater. Time passes. Alexis' skill on the accordion ensures he can work with the musicians and he enjoys the only freedom he will ever have with Eleni. Spyros however constantly tracks them and in a key scene after dancing with his `wife' he has a heart attack. Eleni and Alexis return the dead body to their home village for the funeral where they are greeted with the ridicule of the villagers who accuse them of in effect killing their father. A violent storm floods the village and Alexis and Eleni have no choice but to take their children back to Thessalonika. Alexis takes up an offer from a famous band leader and he sets sail for America promising to send for Eleni and the children when he can. The rest of the film focuses on Eleni's spells of imprisonment (because she harbored Nikos, a communist), and her final release in 1949 where she has to identify the bodies of her two children who lie dead on the battlefield of the civil war. Alexis also having died in the Pacific War, Eleni is left alone with nobody. She screams to the heavens.

On the levels of history and mythology, the film succeeds triumphantly in presenting a picture of the country which concurs completely with the Angelopoulos world view. I will come to the problematic melodrama later, but first, the history. As always with this director names are important. We should start with the character of Eleni. Her name comes from the root Greek word for `Greece' which basically means her story is the story of Greece. Her partner is named Alexis, a name coming from `Alexander', another name which is strongly connected with the country. Remember Angelopoulos made a complex political allegory on Greece called Alexander the Great wherein a peasant bandit merges into a combination of the great emperor from antiquity and the `father of modern Greece' Theodoros Kolokotronis, a fighter in the War of Independence (1821-29). At base then the depiction of Eleni and Alexis represents a depiction of Greece and key historical events that happen are refracted significantly in their story.

The first key event is depicted in the film's opening sequence which has a large group of immigrants returning to their original homeland from Russia as exiles from the civil war then gripping the country. The immigrants arrive out of the sea and walk towards a river, their shadows eventually reflected in the water as a narrator tells us this is to be the story of Eleni (of Greece). Angelopoulos makes very careful use of water throughout the film representing as it does the tide of political uncertainty that envelops everyone and everything. Initially the village of Little Odessa is dry, suggesting hope for these people, but rain clouds gather gradually as the Fascist movement gains force throughout the depression years. Things come to a head when Angelopoulos presents the country's descent into Fascism as a dance followed by a flood. During an impromptu social gathering arranged by the travelling musicians the ousting of a fascist infiltrator interrupts the celebration of the Greek people. Then Spyros enters and dies, the meaning being that old Greece has been betrayed by the young (Alexis says `I killed him'), leaving the door wide open for the Fascists to take control. The funeral cortege by boat to the village commemorates the death of a free Greece. That night's storm and the consequent flood is a metaphor for the August 4th military coup that seized Greece with Metaxas coming to power. From 1936 through to 1949 Greece was engulfed by the uncertain tides of war and successive Fascist regimes (Metaxas, Mussolini, Hitler and then the Fascist Royalists in the civil war) and the water that engulfs the film from this point on reflects the way the expression of free Greek people was drowned and the consequent terminal decline of the country.

Following Alexis's departure to America along with thousands of other Greeks at this time (in itself a major historical event), Eleni's (and Greece's) imprisonment is related very well in her mad ramblings which tell us of the succession of imprisonments she (and her country) has had to endure, where she has been denied water, writing paper to communicate with her children and her own dignity. Foreign occupation whether it be Italian, German, American or British is all the same - it still equals the enslavement of Greece to the agendas of bigger powers intent on cold war politicking and it is the Greek people who suffer. The return to the battlefield scene is rendered with an extraordinary crane shot, starting with the train bringing the women to the riverside. The women are told their sons and husbands are lying behind them and in a moving scene they have to identify the corpses. The camera continues moving along the riverside and zooms in resting on Eleni at the bottom of the frame, her dead son lying by the river at the top and a torrent of water flowing between them. Even in death Greece and her sons are divided by the tide of the powers that be.

The Greek civil war is related by having Eleni's twins fighting on opposite sides and a simple scene where they meet in a ceasefire of the battle on a ridge. They console each other because of the death of their `mother'. Their mother is still alive meaning the `mother' they are talking about is Greece which between them they are in the process of slaughtering. The film's final scene has Eleni return to the flooded village to claim her second slain son, the flooded village being another obvious symbol for the country which lies in ruins. The Royalists will win the war and 1952 will usher in the Papagos administration which will take a hard line on communists, leading eventually to yet another period of Fascism following the Colonels' Coup (1967-1974). No wonder Angelopoulos finishes his film with a long slow zoom in on Eleni (Greece) as she crawls towards her son and screams to the gods as the camera zooms above her head into the sea which has engulfed the country in tragedy. The pessimism at Greece never finding a solution to her many internal problems is a theme that this director obsesses over from first film to last.

Underpinning the history is a rich bed of myth which Angelopoulos deploys to deepen his film and universalize his message. The Travelling Players closely follows the great myth of the House of Atreus as described by Aeschylus in The Oresteia, allowing the events of the plays to drive the action of the film. The Weeping Meadow however, plunges into mythology without letting any single myth shape the narrative quite so specifically - perhaps a more accurate reflection of the way Greek mythology has affected the cultural history of the country. Most prominent is the use of the Oedipus myth especially as written down by Aeschylus in Seven Against Thebes, the third play in a cycle which presumably covered the same ground as the extant Sophocles cycle. The myth shows how an original crime (a man killing his father and marrying his mother) gives way to an incestuous lineage which dooms the city of Thebes to destruction. Alexis and Eleni are cast in the roles of Oedipus and Jocasta while Spyros (also the name of Angelopoulos' father by the way) assumes the mantle of Laius. Alexis and Eleni's crime is incest (they are both brother/sister and son/mother even though not blood-related) which leads to the death of Spyros. Over his father's dead body Alexis assumes responsibility for the patricide. Meanwhile the land (Greece/Thebes) goes to waste (flood) due to the curse brought down by the gods for the crime. The villagers (acting as a Greek chorus) perform a ritual dance to expunge the evil spirits. Accordingly, the `evil spirits' return to Thessalonika with their twin boys. Later the twin boys assume opposing sides and meet each other in the civil war meaning they represent Polynices and Eteocles, the twin sons of Oedipus who fight over Thebes and kill each other in Seven Against Thebes. Other myths saturate the film. Names give obvious hints. Alexis' mother is named `Danae' who happens to be the mother of Perseus (Zeus being the father), the slayer of the Medusa. Her sister is named Cassandra which obviously comes from the Trojan War myth and in the film she voices the prophecy that the country will be doomed by the actions of Spyros' children at the film's outset. Then there is the myth of Odysseus and his endless voyage home most clearly laid out in the farewell scene when Alexis leaves for America on a ship, his Penelope (Eleni) giving him a piece of wool-wear which he unravels as his boat takes him away. For Angelopoulos the whole diaspora experience of Greeks following the tragedy of the civil war could be seen as a re-enactment of the age old myth of voyage and the eternal hope for a great return. This will assume center stage in The Dust of Time.

There is no doubting the staggering richness of what Angelopoulos offers here. The entwining of myth and history makes for spellbinding cinema. Sad to relate though I find the film's total success is qualified by its failure to integrate the melodrama of the central love story within the impressive historical/mythological framework. The film that most comes to mind while watching The Weeping Meadow is The Travelling Players and one can't help drawing comparisons almost totally to the disadvantage of the later film. The Travelling Players was a highly successful left-wing history of Greece from 1939-52 told on three levels of allegorical interpretation - history, theater and myth - which dialectically relate to each other throughout. Angelopoulos deploys a complex time scheme wherein we are constantly alienated and come away with the sensation of watching past, present and future all at the same time - Greece's inability to escape from her tragic past being precisely the point. The Weeping Meadow covers much of the same ground, but rejects complexity for the sake of a straight narrative which starts in 1919 and finishes in 1949 with no deviations in between. This puts heavy stress on the mechanics of conventional plot construction and psychological motivation of the characters. These two things have never been Angelopoulos' biggest strengths and he avoids them in most of his other films. Here there is stiff melodrama, some awkward dialog and even narrative ellipses which simply come over as bad story-telling, dislocated as they are from the Brechtian rigors of The Travelling Players wherein ellipsis of both time and place seems masterly by comparison. Because the story takes place in linear fashion, we constantly expect the central relationship between Eleni and Alexis to develop satisfactorily. In fact it doesn't. The actors can't be blamed for the script denies us any kind of entry into their plight as we have a series of astonishing set-piece scenes which clearly set out an altogether different agenda. Angelopoulos seems to think it is enough to show his victims kissing here and there and then show them worrying over their atrocious surroundings with frowns of consternation and grand declamatory gestures. This might work on stage, but film requires more intimacy. Angelopoulos as per usual refuses to let us close to the characters, keeping his camera back ensuring grand panorama wins over human drama. It's clear that as with The Travelling Players, the director is more concerned with focusing on history and myth and that his characters are simply ciphers - they exist to represent something other than themselves. This means we can never believe in these characters as real people and that on the level of personal drama the film fails. In The Travelling Players this didn't matter as Brechtian alienation rendered characters artificial in any case, but here it is clearly necessary that we believe in the central couple. Lack of belief clearly compromises the success of the final tragic scenes.

Perhaps The Travelling Players succeeds partly because The Oresteia provides a firm frame for the dramatic action that takes place. Myth is inseparable from the drama of history and Angelopoulos doesn't need to build his own narrative in that film. In The Weeping Meadow music takes the place of theater. Wandering actors become wandering musicians and it is much more difficult to tell a story through them. Both groups represent the conscience of the Greek people, but where one is easily rendered on screen by the plays they enact, the other remains elusive. In one way, this provides Angelopoulos with scope to use a very beautiful Eleni Karaindrou musical score and to construct a series of extraordinary music-inspired sequences which give the film a distinctly `folky' texture, but on the other hand it leaves him with an empty hole in the narrative which he has to fill with melodrama of his own making. The stiffness of this becomes even more apparent in The Dust of Time.

Problems of melodrama aside though, this film is still a hugely ambitious and extraordinarily imaginative recreation of the past which only Angelopoulos could have made. His world view and the means he uses to express it remain peculiarly his own. Andreas Sinanos' camerawork here is especially noteworthy entailing wondrous long takes which are dripping in melancholic beauty - the field of sheets hung up to dry, the long slow zoom establishment shot of Little Odessa (the village that Angelopoulos had constructed from scratch) in which we are shown a world, the beautifully worked-out dance scene, the farewell of Alexis as he boards the ship for America (the ship made to look bleached out like one of the old photos used in the opening credits sequence), and most impressively of all those marvelous aquatic sequences of the funeral cortege going back to the village and then the evacuation after the storm. For long sequences of the film the fusion of history and myth with extraordinary cinematography makes for an over-powering effect. I can't think of anything else that compares with Angelopoulos' vision at such times. That in itself makes for a film worthy of the strongest recommendation.

This Artificial Eye DVD is excellent, the pictures (aspect ratio 16:9) and sound very sharp. The film comes with an Angelopoulos filmography and a good 30 minute interview which gives some insights about the film and on working with Tonino Guerra, Marcello Mastroianni, Eleni Karaindrou and others. I recommend you buy this as part of Volume 3 of the complete Angelopoulos collection rather than individually. The disc is exactly the same and you get Ulysses' Gaze, Eternity and a Day and The Dust of Time as well. All four are remarkable films, the first two being especially successful in my view. I have already posted reviews of all three box sets on Amazon. Angelopoulos is a wonderful director and deserves the strongest possible recommendation. If you are interested in contemporary art cinema at all then you should definitely try him.",1411430400,,17707,4.960592792185921
