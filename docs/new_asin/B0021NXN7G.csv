3840606,5,B0021NXN7G,"Season 1 is great n all, but I want more than just the first season of CtCD. I hope they think about releasing Season 2 of Courage the Cowardly Dog soon, cuz I want to see if they release the pilot w/ the Season 2 DVD!!!",1275868800,,220,3.8043478260869565
3840607,4,B0021NXN7G,"Courage the Cowardly Dog is a weird cartoon.

Two of its stars are an elderly couple. The characters don't fall in love. Not every episode ends happily or wraps up nicely. It toggles between having a horror bent to a fantasy bent. It's has its own brand of humor, but is occasionally slapstick.

Reasons to Like Courage:
A) Amazing photo-realistic and CGI images of oddities, characters, and dream sequences. They are spliced into some episodes and they're often pretty captivating.
B) Occasional touching and sweet episodes that are warm, but never mushy. They teach themes like tolerance and appreciating the smaller things in life. It's ironic for Courage to be lined up with such product-placement characters when the show itself seems against those ideals. (Eustace always pays for his greed).
C) Bizzaro story lines that just seem to come out of nowhere. Some of the plot lines are just plain weird. Because of this, Courage would probably never find a huge mass audience and not everyone will like it.

There's a reason Courage was aired later at night. Some of the episodes can be pretty creepy. And yes, there are occasionally less creative or more childish themes. Still, there's no cartoon like Courage. Can't wait for the series to be released!",1273795200,4,1256,4.943127962085308
3840608,5,B0021NXN7G,"Back in the day, when Cartoon Network was in their prime, they had a killer lineup every Friday night. This included Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls, Cow and Chicken, Johnny Bravo, and my personal favorite, a show about a cowardly dog named Courage. I was hooked from the first episode I ever watched, which featured the little black duckling. This show had it all. Great stories were first and foremost. They were like mini-films. The stories were ridiculous, but it didn't matter because they were treated in such an epic way. The animation was great, and the backgrounds were out of this world. As much as I liked Dexter and Powerpuff Girls, their backgrounds were VERY simplistic. It was refreshing to see the style used for Courage, where the backgrounds displayed so much detail and atmosphere, which drew you in to the story all the more. As for Courage himself, true, he was a coward, but in each episode, he had to find a way to put that all aside to save his owners, Muriel and Eustace. Courage was the kind of hero you could relate to. He didn't wanna be the hero, and if you had to go up against some of the crazy stuff he did, you wouldn't wanna be either. But there was something about the dog's anxious disposition and terrified personality that made him a likeable character. He didn't talk much, but what he said mattered. ""I know I'm not gonna like this"" was his battle cry when it came time for action. Then he would pull out some off-the-wall prop or devise some master plan to save the day, and things would go back to normal again, except for the fact that most of the time, the family house was destroyed by the end of the episode.

This is one of the best cartoon series ever made. It's timeless and truly fun to watch. I'm ordering a copy, and so should everyone else who enjoys good storytelling.

P.S.- It's too bad all the negative reviews for a DIFFERENT DVD release are showing up here. Those are for the Australian release, not this one.",1272499200,92,1966,4.504201680672269

3840745,5,B0021NXN7G,"Back in the late 90s/early 2000's, Cartoon Network was at an all time high; hitting one home run after the next with their list of cartoons, including ""Powerpuff Girls"", ""Dexter's Lab"", ""Ed, Edd, n' Eddy"", and many others. But out of all their benchmark shows, the weirdest one out of the pack was, no question, ""Courage the Cowardly Dog."" Taking place in the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas, the series was about a dog named Courage, who lived on a farm with his two owners; a kindly old woman named Muriel, and her grumpy husband, Eustace. Unfortunately for the tiny family, their farm seems to constantly be a magnet for trouble of all kinds, including monsters, magic, aliens, and other worldly happenings. So in spite of being terrified all the time, Courage must always summon his bravery to save his family and his home--often with both creepy and hilarious results. (Because remember folks, 'courage' doesn't mean you're not scared--it's doing what you have to, despite being afraid.)

Simply put, this was a horror show for kids (with ""Goosebumps"" and ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" being the closest comparison), that had a wide range of stories with unconventional heroes and villains. You never quite knew what you were in for, be it something cute, funny, or outright disturbing. Although you always knew Courage would save the day, you never quite knew HOW he was going to do it, making each episode filled with constant twists and surprises. The cast and crew behind the show really knew how to use the off kilter animation and artwork to their full advantage, along with music that would appropriately set the mood (often sounding classical and/or very old, unlike the electronic/techno music that seems to dominate most cartoons). It also wasn't afraid to push the boundaries of what could get past the censors, often throwing in dark and/or adult subject matter, but disguising it under a ton of symbolism and metaphors that a younger audience could understand.

With all that said, I was beyond thrilled to see the first season finally get a release. Included is all of the first thirteen episodes (meaning two 11 minute cartoons to make up a half hour). Some of my favorites include ""The Shadow of Courage"" (which has a tear jerking ending), ""Courage Meets Bigfoot"" (which teaches to not judge a book by it's cover), ""King Ramses' Curse"" (an episode that most people peg as one of the scarier stories--I think it's more funny, actually), and ""The Hunchback of Nowhere"" (an episode that tugs on the heartstrings, teaching that beauty is only skin deep, and also showing that not all the show's stories were meant to be scary. Some could be incredibly touching).  Unfortunately, the pilot episode that started the show--""The Chicken from Outer Space"", isn't included, for some odd reason.  There's also no special features what so ever. It would've been nice to have at least a featurette of some kind talking about the show's creation, or the lasting impact it had on the fans.

But despite the cut and dry release, if you loved the show, this two-disc set is a must have! Here's hoping they not only release the rest of the series, but start bringing the other Cartoon Network shows onto DVD.",1445299200,,3212,4.854014598540146

3840871,5,B0021NXN7G,"I grew up watching Courage, so it was a real pleasure to be able to see this animation come to DVD!

This animation follows the life of a cowardly dog and his encounters with the paranormal creature lurking around his home. While being named Courage, the canine in question is actually more frightened of the things he comes into contact with than being courageous--in fact Courage only becomes bold when Muriel, a sweet-natured Scottish woman, is involved. Courage was abandoned as a puppy and was taken in by Muriel, despite her husband Eustace Bagge's dismay. Eustace is nothing like Muriel and spends the majority of the episodes harrassing Courage and plotting ways to become weathy. Together, the trio live out in the middle of Nowhere (based off of Nowhere, Kansas) where they continuously encounter all kinds of frightening creatures--though some of them turn out to be rather friendly, just misunderstood. There are a good handful of characters that make numerous appearances in the episodes such as Courage's sarcastic computer (who is ultimately the one to aid Courage in defeating his foes during most of his battles), the family physician Dr. Vindaloo, the gypsy fortune-teller Shirley the Medium, Eustace's mother, the revenge seeking feline Katz, and the crazy Le Quack. Despite being a horror animation series, Courage is filled with comedic relief and offers many kinds of lesson to children--Courage always maintains respect and kindness to others despite what their appearances are and is always willing to help others (even if they start off doing things that are not good).

Courage was not really a comical cartoon however Eustace Bagge provides some comic relief its more a horror show. Courage always saving that old woman and the Farm they lived on from danger in Nowhere Kansas. It is often somewhat scary and sad.",1398729600,3,491,4.223404255319149

3840875,5,B0021NXN7G,"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Courage the Cowardly Dog are the best animated monster shows in recent year's, also the best shows Cartoon Network had ever had, today I am gonna briefly share my thoughts of Courage the Cowardly Dog. First off, I have to say that this release should have had special features out of respect for the show and moreover, the fans, but sadly Cartoon Network doesn't pay much mind in that area at times, even worse, they almost NEVER release all the seasons of these great shows, they do one or in ""volumes"" and release all of one season or just half of one as a ""volume"" and stop, such a spit in the face to customers, but at least we have SOMETHING (?).

Anyways, Courage the Cowardly Dog is such an impeccably amazing show with great characters, a great atmosphere, great soundtrack, and most importantly, really, really great monsters and villains, this show is so bizarre it is truly amazing that kids took to it because when watching this show it doesn't seem like it would appeal to kids, but neither do many great cartoons. Courage is such a likable heroic and brave dog despite how easily he gets scared, he really lives up to his name, and is so loyal to his owners despite one of them being pretty cruel most of the time, he is a dog of few words and mostly makes weird noises, you could say he mumbles or just talk to fast, I'm not sure. Each episode is different and always fun and brings us special treats upon each viewing and every episode (of this season at least) is well worth multiple viewings, that is super rare and only applies to great cartoons, this one is just so watchable and fun and is enjoyable not just by kids but adults as well, I HIGHLY recommend Courage the Cowardly Dog and I really hope more seasons will be released in the near future.

3840876,5,B0021NXN7G,"I really adore this cartoon. It's amazing what they could get away with in those days, and this show really pushed the creepy factor for a Y7 cartoon.
This show has more than just creepiness, though; it has heart, charm and a lot of humor. I laughed out loud a few times before. It also has a lot of memorable characters; both the good guys and the villains.
This show can get pretty deep and have some pretty dark moments, so beware to those who want to show this to very young children.
My only gripe is that only the first and second seasons are on DVD. If I do not see the rest of the seasons on DVD soon, I will freak out.",1394150400,,627,4.064516129032258

3840892,5,B0021NXN7G,"This show was amazing, still is. It is one of thew best shows on CN. However this show (despite it's Y7 rating) is really meant for older or more mature children. This show is very classic animation with the way courage (the pink dog for those that don't know) communicates, walks, and talks, which may appeal to younger children. However this show deals with horror. Sure most of the episodes are about were-moles or giant hamsters or even headless chickens, very appealing to children. However the few (4 out of 10 times) episodes that do pop up question how this show is Y7. Dealing with elements such as murder, death, hauntings, and in one case prostitution. FOR EXAMPLE: The Mask- this episode is about a cat who appears wearing a classical drama mask wearing all white. She examples to the Bagges that her friend is being held hostage by a group of dogs. Sounds like it would appeal to kids right? Well, her friend's boss(?) beats her and treats her as a slave. Though they never literally SHOW the beatings they imply HEAVILY on it and the kids will probably catch on it. In addition this episode also contains a scene where the kidnapped kitty and dog getting out of a car, when the dog gets out he says a phrase (I am sorry i could not find the quote) that implies the kitty and dog where having some sort of sex. END OF EXAMPLE. As you can see this episode is NOT meant for kids. Another example of this is the episode EVERYONE WANTS TO DIRECT. In this episodes (to cut things short) involves a zombie ""director"" who wants to reanimate his friend then record themselves eating Muriel. Plus to add on to that when courage uses the computer  to do research there is an article that says the two ""directors"" SLAY 12. Which is very questionable to a 7 year old .
SHORT ON TIME? HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS:
pros-
Good unique show
funny ways Courage gets beaten up and when he saves the day
lasting appeal
funny humor
cons-
VERY questionable content in episodes
Scary or disturbing creatures/entities

3840973,4,B0021NXN7G,"So okay, the ""Courage the Cowardly Dog"" animated series (hereafter ""Courage"") borrows liberally from other shows and concepts.  Of course, Courage is a smaller, pink, beagle (I guess) version of Scooby-Doo who badly needs an orthodontist.  Speaking of beagles, Courage is a little bit like Snoopy, except his adventures are ""real"", not imaginary, and far scarier.  ""Courage"" even reminds me of the ""Porky Pig and Sylvester"" Warner Bros. cartoon shorts, where Porky and the cowardly poltroon Sylvester stay in a haunted house or similar frightening place, and Sylvester sees the danger (e.g. murderous mice, ghosts, aliens) but almost never can convince the skeptical, annoyed Porky they exist.  And yet, ""Courage"" feels searingly macabre, eerie, inventive, grotesquely bizarre, but ultimately affecting.

  For you see, Courage is the ultimate unwanted orphan, seemingly despised by everybody.  Certainly, the curmudgeonly, greedy, irascible, ""American Gothic"" farmer Eustace can't stand the ""stupid dog"".  Only Eustace's matronly, plump, sweet-natured, somewhat clueless wife and homemaker Muriel cares about Courage.  Therefore, when their VERY remote farm is visited or threatened by some way-out force, monster, alien, whatever, or their vacation in another land is interrupted by a way-out force, monster, etc., ""Courage"" paradoxically lives up to his name, swallows his timidity, and risks all to save his elderly adopted family.  Courage performs his heroic, painful feats for the love of Muriel alone (and always succeeds in saving her), although he also gallantly strives to save the ungrateful, secretly chicken Eustace as well (not always successfully).  Occasionally, in addition to Muriel, Courage amazingly may have to save a character who appears ghoulish initially, but really needs the canine's help.

  If you like and can handle spooky, off-the-wall, even unsettling plots and characters, foreboding ambience, and insane but off-beat and creative adventure and action, ""Courage"" is for you.  ""Courage"" also may primarily appeal more to hip, smart, unflappable teenagers and adults, as opposed to sensitive, tender-aged children.  Finally, if you like rooting for a long-suffering, put-upon, almost completely unappreciated, but ultimately triumphant ""underdog"", ""Courage"" is just the ticket.

  I know, blah, blah, blah, as Eustace would say.",1348012800,,2361,5.76878612716763
3840974,5,B0021NXN7G,"My son loved this cartoon when it was on TV.  Then 1 day it was gone , so we ordered this.",1347840000,,90,3.2857142857142856

When I was younger and all I did was play outside/video games or watch Cartoon Network. Those times have since gone by the wayside, I am no longer a child and Cartoon Network has butchered it's namesake. Even though, Cartoon Network is trying to go back to it's roots with shows such as Adventure Time, Gumball, and Regular Show( with Gumball being the exception due to the fact it is somewhat imported). I was atleast happy that Cartoon Network was thoughtful enough to distribute episodes of their past shows with their Cartoon Netwoek Hall of Fame sets. Still waiting on the Season 2's of Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Lab and of course Courage!",1342310400,,735,4.75
3840978,5,B0021NXN7G,"Courage the Cowardly Dog is one of the best series to come out of the classic Cartoon Network that practically framed my childhood from 1996 to roughly 2003. Courage was the last show to be serialized from the animation showcase ""What a Cartoon! Show"" which was later known as the ""Cartoon Cartoon Show"". This show consisting of 48 cartoon shorts served as a launch pad for many of my favorite shows from the time such as Dexter's Laboratory, The PowerPuff Girls, and Johnny Bravo. Out all of these great shows though, Courage the Cowardly Dog was probably my favorite. As a child I loved the show for its great comedy and charming characters as well as for the fact that sometimes it was a little scary. I'm 20 years old now and upon watching this season i cant help but love it for the charming and unique music, good voice acting, and humorous spin on classic horror movies and cliches.

  Now on to the actual set. This is the second release in the Cartoon Network Hall of Fame, and was preceded by Johnny Bravo and succeeded by Dexter's Laboratory (Sadly that is all the releases that I expect we'll see). The releases grew worse quality wise as they came, with JB containing actual special features, to Courage with no special features, to Dexter with no special features and less attractive non-colored discs. I'm assuming these sets didn't sell very well (I bought all three, but it seems i may be one of the few) as their seems to be no talk of any other show releases, nor a continuation of the seasons of the shows released (which is really a shame because I feel Dexter specifically had a superior second season). The Powerpuff Girls (arguably the most popular show from this time period) has had the entire show released in one big set, which i would love to see with many other CN shows, specifically Courage.

  Their are 13 episodes in this set on two discs, with each episode consisting of two shorts. Which means their are actually 26 different cartoons in the season. Other cartoons releases lately have taken the cheap shot of calling 13 shorts 13 episodes. In this set no such shots are taken.

  This is a great show and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes cartoons. The show still feels fresh and is equally entertaining to adults as well as children (well adults who like cartoons), and it doesn't have that childish corniness some cartoons have that you don't notice as a kid (Dexter's Laboratory). I still don't know why the original Cartoon Cartoon short ""The Chicken from Outer Space"" couldn't have been added to the set as a special feature though. Still a 5 star release regardless.",1338076800,3,2613,4.62634989200864

3841031,5,B0021NXN7G,"This is one of my favortie cartoons. It was exteremly clever and witty. A little creepy and weird, with tons of humor. It's a cartoon anyone can enjoy, really. As I'm an adult now, I don't find it to be as scary as I did when I was kid, naturally, but that's never really why I watched Courage as a kid. There was just something about this cartoon that drew you in. I think the creators of the show were also atheists, because you could see a tad few references in this show making fun of religion. Also, there were some real cool episodes that were kind of astrology based. Overall, it's a fantastic show. The entire series is good, but the first season takes the cake! It's a must buy. I can't wait to order this myself and relive this classic cartoon. It can truly be called a classic.",1303776000,,788,4.26

3841052,4,B0021NXN7G,"I loved this show when i was a kid; still do, in fact. But as time has passed I've moved on from just watching the show to wanting to see what makes the show. I love to watch movies and series for their ""making of"" and commentaries- and that's the problem with this product; there are no special features. No interviews, commentaries, or even a flippin game. Its nice to rewatch your favorite shows once in a while but it's also nice to back them up with extras to further entertain the viewer. All in all, the product itself is great. All episodes from season 1 are there, the sound and vision quality are more than up to snuff, ect. But it could have been much more. I just pray that season two will have a bit more in store when (and if) it comes out. ...Also, the disc 1 main menu was blackened out on my screen (disc 2 worked fine); I don't know if this is a common problem with people or not, all I know is that it happened with mine.",1282608000,,940,4.114130434782608
3841053,5,B0021NXN7G,"I just received my DVD set yesterday and am watching it now. It's great to finally own a little bit of Courage. First, note that this item, the Cartoon Network Hall of Fame set, is the US, Region 1 release, NOT the PAL release (some reviews for the Australian DVDs got combined with this; disregard those reviews as they do not apply), so it will play on American DVD players with no trouble. I can confirm that there are no special features; the DVDs are pretty no frills, sporting only the episodes and the option to turn closed captioning (English only) on or off. Nonetheless, it is nicely presented, and although I'm no expert in picture quality, the video looks great to me. Both discs are packaged in one standard plastic case, and this case comes inside a shiny cardboard sleeve.

Onto the meat: the episodes. This is the full first season, 13 full episodes (so 26 sub-episodes) on 2 discs. The playtime is listed at 286 minutes. Again, there are no extras. It would have been nice to see at least the pilot, but we can hope for that to be included in the other seasons (which I dearly hope will be released as well). I'm just happy to have such classic Courage moments as Welcome to the Katz Motel, Freaky Fred, Shirley the Medium, The Hunchback of Nowhere, King Ramses' Curse, Little Muriel, and many others in my grasp. If that's what you're looking for too, you'll be pleased with this DVD set.

For those who are new to the series, it follows the adventures of Courage, a little dog with a big heart when it comes to his owner, the elderly Muriel (and her jerk of a husband, Eustace). They live in a little house in the middle of Nowhere, where, as the announcer in the opening of each episode states, ""freeeaky stuff happens."" Courage constantly risks his hide to save the two unwitting humans from certain doom. The series is whimsical, quirky, and creepy, full of both memorable characters and solid humor. It's one both parents and children alike will enjoy - my mother, little sisters, and I used to watch it all the time when I was younger.

Full DVD list (it's been noted before, but heck, I'll type it up to make this review complete):

First disc:
1. A Night at the Katz Motel / Cajun Granny Stew
2. The Shadow of Courage / Dr. Le Quack
3. Courage Meets Bigfoot / Hothead

3841054,5,B0021NXN7G,"Cartoon Network had a lot going for it in the late 90's/early 00's. Shows like Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Ed Edd n Eddy, and The Powerpuff girls were all top quality children's cartoons that could also appeal to adults. They were aimed at kids, for sure, but they were very, very clever (especially PPG.) This show, however, was not so much aimed at children. It was pretty kid friendly, but overall this was an artistic show that was just plain and simple really good. I was 14 when it was popular, and now being 23, I understand why i got into it at a somewhat ""older kid"" age. The type of comedy was so original, and the show was so incredibly artistic. I find myself very influenced by shows like The Mighty Boosh these days, and Courage was in the same category. Odd, humorous dark stories that were presented in a unqiue and captivating way filled this show with so much to offer. You won't find me buying Johnny Bravo at 23, but Courage? I'm not ashamed to say yes. It was just a good show.

Taking a close look at this show, you can tell the care that went into each episode. The animation itself is so simple and colorful, but done in such a unique way. They always knew how to shade everything perfectly to fit the mood. The music was spot on as well. They just happened to have a crew of people working on every aspect of the show that all really ""got"" what John R. Dilworth was aiming for. It was like a tight band. I'd also like to point out that episodes like ""The Shadow of Courage"" and ""The Hunchback of Nowhere"" are some of the most brilliantly written, touching pieces of animation I've ever seen. Not many shows can get away with being borderline gruesome one minute, and almost have you shedding a tear the next. This was a masterful series.

I'm not one to buy a TV show on DVD simply because I watched it when I was a kid. Nostalgia is not a selling point to someone who cares about quality. I watched Ninja Turtles as a kid, but I know that that show was just filler. Great for kids, but there was no such thing as a standout episode in a series like that. Might be cool to see it once again online to say ""hey, remember this!?"", but no reason to drop money on it. This show, however, really should be purchased by anyone who is a fan of art, comedy, or animation. If I was teaching a film class, a stage writing class, or an animation class, I would show some of this stuff to my students. I really hope the other seasons get DVD releases too. This was a fantastic piece of animation, and it really stood the test of time. There's a reason it still gets shown in reruns occasionally, almost 10 years after the final episode aired. It was never the fad, never the highest rated, but it was always there. And always appreciated. And it still is. I won't be surprised if this DVD sells more than Johnny Bravo or Dexter, despite the fact that those shows were much more popular when they were in production. Most kids of that generation who are adults aren't going to buy those. I'm willing to bet the Courage fans, the true ones, have grown up to appreciate what the show really was, and will want to have it on hand. I know I do. This was one of the best things to come out of the animation field in recent times, and it's a shame that it gets overlooked in that sense by the general public.

I personally could care less about extras. I just want the episodes. This is all I need. King of the Hill only got released up to season 6 due to low DVD sales, which was awful, seeing as how it was also a really great animated show. Do yourself a favor and make sure not to ignore this series. Support this DVD. Support QUALITY",1280275200,35,3651,4.265512265512266
3841055,5,B0021NXN7G,"I've tried to go back and watch many of the old cartoons I watched when I was a child.  Most of them have not held up.  The stories are too repetitive and the jokes are often couched in pop culture that has quickly faded from memory.  Courage the Cowardly Dog is one of the few series that I've actually appreciated more through revisiting.

The show is driven by the three main characters (Courage and his owners, Eustace and Muriel), who each episode encounter some horror that certainly is not expected of ordinary animated fare.  Many episodes are pulled out of classic science-fiction, fantasy or horror, but the source material is never used as a crutch for jokes; each episode manages to adopt the story as its own.

Nothing on TV ever scared me the way this series did, but few series will be remembered more fondly.  There might be no other cartoons that can match the excellent balance of gravitas and humor that keep Courage fresh even a decade after its debut.  Hopefully the other seasons will soon make their way to DVD.",1280016000,2,1034,4.612021857923497
3841056,5,B0021NXN7G,I love this show so much and the only reason its gotten bad reviews is because people think that this is the version with a different region. This is an official release and it will play on your dvd if you live in the US,1280016000,2,220,3.911111111111111
3841057,5,B0021NXN7G,"Every time I watched a new episode (when Courage was still new) then each year after watching a couple reruns on CN Im always thinking and hoping they should release Courage the Cowardly Dog, a brilliantly awesome cartoon, on DVD, and my Summer, and life, just got alot better when I saw that they were! Courage didn't deserve to be cancelled, I miss the days when CN actually had a great line-up, and hated to see Courage and a bunch of others (Johnny Bravo, PPG, Dexter) go, especially Courage! Its just such a great show, with great characters and such a deep plot that they couldve hashed out alot more stories and been on the air for years! John R. Dilworth is and always will be a genius! I guess I should be glad that it lasted as long as it did, I just hope they release the other 2 seasons, and it wouldnt hurt to release some merch as well. Seriously, a Courage the Cowardly Dog video game incorporating all the characters/monsters/villians from the show? AWESOME!!",1279756800,2,975,4.5141242937853105
3841058,4,B0021NXN7G,"Your favorite scaredy-cat dog has finally made it to DVD !  (No, not that one; this mutt's more high-strung, not to mention a bad set of choppers.)

It's Courage the Cowardly Dog in his frightening first season with unlucky 13 episodes featuring him, the kindhearted Muriel and the cantankerous Eustace.  His adventures in Nowhere include the following:

""Night at the Katz Motel"" - The family spends a night at Katz's menacing motel.  Courage must get out of there before the felonious Katz makes them check out - PERMANENTLY !

""The Shadow of Courage"" - A mischievous shadow of a recently dead guy wreaks havoc on the farm.  Courage must find out what the shadow's really up to.

""The Demon in the Mattress"" - Muriel's new mattress is possessed !  Courage must find a way to get rid of the mattress and the demon.

""The Duck Brothers"" - Alien ducks hypnotize Eustace and Muriel in an attempt to save their third brother.

""The Gods Must Be Goosey"" - A goose god falls in love with Muriel, which means Courage must find someone else for the god to love.

""Everyone Wants to Direct"" - A zombie filmmaker produces his next production in the farmhouse's basement only to reveal that he's about to resurrect his long-lost partner and eat Muriel !

""Journey to the Center of Nowhere"" - During a drought, Courage spies vengeful eggplants plotting to destroy Muriel.

And that's about it.  Nothing more, nothing, uh, MORE on this DVD.  Personally, I'd expect a special feature involving series creator and director John R. Dilworth and, of course, the ""What a Cartoon"" pilot episode ""The Chicken from Outer Space"".  Well, to quote from Eustace, ""Stupid DVD makers !""

Well, for now, this and ""Johnny Bravo: Season One"" is now available in the ""Cartoon Network Hall of Fame"" Collection, but get this: ""Dexter's Laboratory: Season One"" is coming this fall !  Don't miss out on that !",1279584000,3,1875,4.74922600619195

Nothing vulgar, no crude jokes, just some violent and odd imagery.
