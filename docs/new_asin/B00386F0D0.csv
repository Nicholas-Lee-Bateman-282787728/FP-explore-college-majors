4083417,4,B00386F0D0,The first movie was a 5 star for my kids and for me.  The first movie was funny and great laughs for my kids.  The second movie was a huge let down that is why the whole review was only 4 stars.  My kids could barely make it through the second movie.,1334793600,5,250,3.769230769230769
4083418,4,B00386F0D0,"While the cartoon it ain't, it's still a bit of a hoot.  It's melodrama at its best, really, because the hero's a hunk, the leading lady is a beaut, and the villains are certainly villainous.  The two henchmen are delightfully stupid and eee-vil, and ""Ape"" is a riot and a half.  I loved the original ""George of the Jungle,"" and these movies aren't half bad.  They are definitely good for a laugh or two, and you won't be sorry you got them.  I only gave them four stars because I guess I was spoiled by the original cartoon characters.  Still, these two movies aren't in the least bad.",1329523200,2,586,4.37962962962963
4083419,4,B00386F0D0,If you like slapstick almost cartoonish humor then you'll love the first movie its silly and not meant to be taken too seriously but the second movie was not very good but my daughter does seem to like it,1327190400,,204,4.256410256410256
4083420,3,B00386F0D0,"I call this movie, ""Jungle Slap Stick"" comedy. The original ""George"" is better than ""George of the Jungle, 2"". Brenden Fraser is very good and you cannot help but be enticed by his facial expressions. ""George, 2"" had more animalistic behaviors which was a little too much. The actor who played George, characterized the original George very well, right down to the funny facial expressions. Good buy for one time viewing...I might watch it again on a snowy evening.",1324252800,4,465,4.89873417721519
4083421,4,B00386F0D0,"George of the Jungle 1 & 2 were little goofy but I thought fun. They went along with the cartoons with a added
romantic twist. To me it was a fun movie and entertaining. I bought the movie at Amazon and I feel it was worth the
money.",1324080000,,233,3.875
4083422,5,B00386F0D0,Our grandchildren had seen George of the Jungle 1 - so we bought both of the movies.  It made a great gift and they have enjoyed watching them.,1305763200,6,143,4.107142857142857
4083423,4,B00386F0D0,"You will find enough reviews about both movies, and its hard to beat the deal for this 2 movie package.  One caveat is that George - part 1 is in 4:3 format and I do not think that they transferred the video properly.  I could be wrong, but in this day and age, it looked squarish on a Plasma and the big-screen.  Part 2 was in widescreen (16:9) format, and the video transfer looked good too.",1293753600,3,393,4.144736842105263
4083424,4,B00386F0D0,"George of the Jungle #1 is an entertaining movie that we'll watch several times a year.  Life is too serious, we need to get away from reality and this movie is one of several that do that.

IMHO #2 needed the same casting as #1 to have even brought it close to being worth revisiting.",1284854400,11,285,4.163636363636364
4083425,5,B00386F0D0,"I've been waiting for George of the Jungle to come out on DVD for years now, and I'm very excited to see that it's finally here this year~and with GJ 2 to boot!

Haven't watched much of the second one because I always hate when they switch actors for a character's role. I can never get past it. But for the price, can't beat it! I do wish a blue-ray option was offered. Still great though!",1502755200,,350,3.875

4083454,5,B00386F0D0,"The 5 star review is really for the quality and timely manner of which this product was received.

But if you're looking for the movie review itself, the sequel is full of bad acting and they overdid the cheesiness that made the original movie cute and funny. The ex-fiance, however, managed to deliver well. He was the only actor from the original cast.

Overall, my son loves both movies and I don't have to play it off my DVR anymore. Lol",1451433600,3,441,4.432098765432099

4083463,5,B00386F0D0,"The first movie is so incredibly cute that it's worth the price alone, but the second, OMG, it's SO bad...SO bad. (Everyone but Lyle & the Mother are different actors in number 2...probably your two LEAST favorite characters...haha) I went ahead and got this version though because I have a little boy who is currently a toddler and he just LOVES movies with talking animals. I am pretty sure that he will get much enjoyment out of both of these movies since he's not really a connoisseur of fine films yet. His favorite movie currently is
""Russell Madness"" with a wrestling Jack Russell Terrier that has a monkey for a coach in the ring. It's awesomely ridiculous...but he adores it so much that I now love it too!
This is a really fun movie to cuddle up and watch together & George playing fetch with Shep the Elephant actually had my son laughing out loud!",1436313600,3,859,4.548387096774194
