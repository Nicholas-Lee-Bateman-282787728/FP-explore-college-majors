8510765,3,B007691HXM,"The quality of transfer is mostly poor . The first hour or so is dark and grainy then suddenly there is change, there is fairly good half hour or so towards the end which is watchable . I don't know how to explain it but some how the producer of this dvd  woke up and realized he is doing a s***ty job and put little afford to clean up the last half of the dvd . I saw the movie in a theater back in the 70's the problem is not the movie. I give it 3 stars for a few good scene  ,specialy the one with genifer wells.",1439596800,2,516,3.7247706422018347
