8488818,3,B005XO9FJK,"I saw a more recent movie made of this story with Annette O'Toole as the mother.  I liked it better except where they had one of the characters, Freckles being an owl and never presented him as a person.",1416787200,2,203,4.205128205128205
8488819,1,B005XO9FJK,"I wasn't aware when I purchased this movie that the film had never been restored.  The movie is choppy all the way through, skipping and jumping.  The end was the worst because there isn't much of the end on the DVD!",1378857600,7,216,4.2439024390243905
8488820,3,B005XO9FJK,Purchased this item due to living in the area of the Limberlost in Indiana. It was an okay movie. I shared it with family. Packaging is colorful and attractive.,1378080000,4,160,4.551724137931035
8488821,3,B005XO9FJK,I loved this book so was eager to see the movie.  From what I remember (it's been awhile since I read the book) the movie sticks very closely to the book but the quality of the film is very poor.  There was so much background noise that it was distracting and took away from the enjoyment of it.  The actors themselves were very good and I would have given it more than 3 stars otherwise.,1344297600,9,388,4.1466666666666665
