3653820,5,B001JAHPRQ,The only way to watch this season is to buy the individual streaming episodes from Amazon. It's not available in Full season yet streaming nor on DVD to buy as I put this to print. This is Jon's last season and the season where Eric Estrada walked away from the series over his contract for a month. He was temporarily replaced by Olmpian Bruce Jenner fresh after the Olympics. Some of the episodes deal with Ponch in a Punk band and as a stripper. About 26 episodes this season. It's also Bonnie's final season ( Randi Oakes). Fun and entertaining.,1465948800,9,549,4.5
3653821,5,B001JAHPRQ,Always loved this show. Especially the episode Bomb Run. It was filmed at the old Rialto Airport. I grew up at that airport and was where I first learned to fly. It's a shame the city leveled it just to build warehouses.,1464566400,4,220,4.261904761904762
3653822,5,B001JAHPRQ,"I was excited to finally have Season 4 on DVD, but Season 5 is also one of my favorite seasons of this series.  I like to refer to this season as ""The Big Season,"" because it contains 27 episodes.  Twenty-seven!  This far surpasses the standard 22-episode season of this or any other series.  Definitely in its stride, this season explores more stories, such as using futuristic equipment to rip off couriers on the freeway, using lasers to rob box offices, taking on a lawless rock band, or joining the social elite crowd to foil the embezzlement of classic luxury car profits.

I felt this was a great season, which unfortunately saw the departure of Larry Wilcox, but enjoyable, nonetheless.",1458604800,8,694,4.798319327731092
3653823,5,B001JAHPRQ,"Awesome!
Chips  is  top  of  the  line.
Just  a  few  years  ago  they  didn't  have  season  3  out  just  yet.  Now  they're  just  about  done  releasing  the  series.
Season  5  was  good.",1458086400,,192,4.15625
3653824,5,B001JAHPRQ,"CHiPs 1981-82 Season was my favorite season even though this police dramas 5th Season had some twists and turns and set backs in it.

For instance, this was the last season with Ponch's old partner Jon Baker(Larry Wilcox), since Jon was replaced by Ponch's new hot-dog rookie partner Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly) in the 6th Season, due to the fact that Larry Wilcox didn't get along very well with Erik Estrada, even though Ponch & Jon seemed quite inseperable during all 5 years of their partnership throughout the first 5 seasons of this police drama.

This 1981-1982 Season was also the season when famous world athlete celebrity(Bruce Jenner)briefly joined the cast & crew of this show as Jon's interim partner(Officer Steve McLeisch) in the episodes ""The Killer Indy"", ""Anything But The Truth"", and ""Diamonds In The Rough"", since Erik Estrada(Ponch) had unfortunately left the show temporarily in the mid-Fall of 1981 due to a salary dispute which contributed to a nose-dive in the ratings, but Ponch had returned to the show permanently in late November of 1981 starting with the ""Finders Keepers"" episode since Steve's purpose to help save the show by subbing for Ponch in Estrada's absence was obviously unsuccessful.

Fortunately, the ratings on this police drama surged back up when Ponch came back permanently and when McLeisch departed the show after the ""Concours d' Elegance"" episode in December of 1981.

In other words, the producers of CHiPs had to bring Ponch back permanently to save the show in order to prevent it from getting the boot by NBC, despite the frequent rivalry between Wilcox & Estrada behind the set.

What I found baffling about CHiPs Fifth Season was in all 3 of the episodes where Steve temporarily replaced Ponch as Jon's interim partner with Ponch no where to be found during Estrada's boycott of the show, they still used Erik Estrada's name & picture on the introduction and nobody on the series, including Jon and their hard-nosed superior officer Sgt. Joe Getraer(Robert Pine) ever even mentioned a word about Ponch or why he wasn't around or anything as if Ponch never even existed, which didn't make a lot of sense, but was apparently due to the rumor that the producers were trying to get rid of Ponch and end Estrada's contract with this police drama.

Additionally, CHiPs 1981-82 Season had a lousy season finale episode on top of that, which by the way was the ""Force Seven"" episode, since they only showed Ponch & Jon in only 2 brief scenes, but in the rest of the episode, it had absolutley nothing to do with Ponch or Jon and it involved a martial arts force gang infiltrating sadistic racketeers who were involved in highly illegal crime sprees, which was certainly no way to have a last episode with Jon Baker, especially since it didn't give us a chance to see Jon in action one last time or see Jon do his best one last time as Ponch's partner, but it just so happens that Tom Reilly guest starred in this episode as a rookie LAPD officer who gets involved with the ""Force Seven"" group before his first appearance as Ponch's new hot-dog partner(Bobby Nelson) in the following episode ""Meet The New Guy"".

It was also neat seeing guest stars like
*William Lucking in the ""Moonlight"" episode before his co-starring days as the overzealous Army nemesis(Col. Lynch) on THE A-TEAM

*William Boyett in the ""Silent Partner"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*Douglas McClure in the ""Battle Of The Bands"" episode before his co-starring days on OUT OF THIS WORLD

*George Lindsay in the ""Bright Flashes"" episode after his co-starring days on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW

*Susan Richardson in the ""Battle Of The Bands"" episode after her co-starring days on EIGHT IS ENOUGH

*Anne Francis in the ""In The Best Of Families"" episode after her co-starring days on the short-lived HONEY WEST & before her co-starring days on the detective drama RIPTIDE

*Norman Burton in the ""Tiger In The Streets"" episode after his co-starring days as Joe Atkinson on WONDER WOMAN

*Don Stroud in the ""Trained For Trouble"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lussen on THE NEW DRAGNET

*Noble Willingham in the ""Finders Keepers"" episode before his co-starring days on WALKER TEXAS RANGER

*Fred Dryer in the ""Force Seven"" episode before his co-starring days as Los Angeles police Sgt. Rick Hunter on the police detective drama HUNTER

*Jonathan Goldsmith in the ""Finders Keepers"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

CHiPs 5th Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was living in the Imperial Valley in my hometown(El Centro, CA) and when NBC's motto was ""Our Pride Is Showing"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1981 thru the Summer of 1982 along with the fact that I was 9 years old at Rockwood Elementry School in Calexico, CA at the time along with all the budget cuts we had going on back then from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president.

I also used to watch CHiPs in reruns on Me-TV, TNT, and TBS years ago too!",1229472000,20,5052,4.806228373702422

I wish seasons 4, 5, and 6 were full frame like seasons 1-3. What gives Warner Bros/Amazon? That's why my rating is only 3 stars. And if the black bars had to be done (widescreen I'm assuming), you guys could've done them horizontally (see my example below via photo, yes I was watching the ID Channel + Charmed) instead of vertical, and not make them so thick.",1498003200,,538,4.336633663366337

3653940,5,B001JAHPRQ,"Season 5 introduces the former Bruce Jenner as officer Steve McLeish. At times Erik Estrada was in a work dispute with the network and Bruce took over for a few episodes. Season 5 is just as cheesy (and I mean that in a good way) as the rest of the seasons, but I think the producers required at least two and sometimes three car jump accidents per episode. That's some action! Season 5 has lasers, a battle of the bands, hillbilly con artists, tigers, toxic waste, pot, street races, airplanes, jet-packs, karate, and a bad episode with two chicks named Mitchell & Woods who become detectives in an obvious spin off attempt. Good thing it failed. Season 5 is fun and full of action. Just one more season to go!

Update:
Ugh, the last episode of the season is another failed spin-off attempt. This one is about an elite LAPD martial arts force. Good thing there is only one season left. This is also the last episode featuring Officer Jon Baker. He does not return in Season 6 due to a contract dispute.",1494288000,2,1003,4.48087431693989

3653956,4,B001JAHPRQ,"I love this series , lots of retro looks and cars. Stylish lingo and fads. Good viewing no worries. Now, if the movies were included remastered.

Having brought the 2nd season twice because of bad double-sided discs, I have some suggestions for next Season Six at the end of this:
The third and fourth series used a 5-disc layout. This series gets a 5-disk layout for more episodes-27 in all. Enough people must be buying the series for Warner to not skimp on discs. Compressing the data to 6 episodes per disk (except for the disc 5 which has 3 episodes) at about 4 hours and 50min playing time. I really do not know for sure if fitting so much data is going to cause problems. Maybe the 5 season had excellent video quality sources. But seems like all the good series I brought had less episodes per disc-on one side. Six Million Dollar Man had an average of 3 episodes per disc and ran about same as ChiPs at 50min. per episode. (movies not counted) . Update: from CHiPs wiki Season: The Sixth Season of CHiPs has 22 episodes on a planned 4-disc layout. Season 2 had 22 episodes on 6-discs. Season 4 had 21 episodes on a 5 disc layout. Both of these TV seasons had 4 and or 5 max five episodes per disc. For Season 6: I say, ""Warner, use 5 discs and alternate 4 to 5 episodes to discs. hint:(4x3) + (5x2) = where 3 discs have 4 episodes each 2 discs have 5 episodes per disc for a total of 5 discs.",1491091200,,1401,4.227611940298507

3653963,5,B001JAHPRQ,"CHiPs is one of my all time favorites and is one of those great shows I love as much now as I did when I was a kid.  Of course the corniness is a little more apparent now, but it is a guilty pleasure!  I don't remember as many of these episodes from the 5th Season and I don't particularly enjoy having Bruce Jenner replace Ponch (his acting was a bit stiff and of course my opinion of him personally is jaded by his personal life in recent years) in some of the episodes.  I do enjoy getting to see these again though, and for me it is the first time for several of the episodes.
The video and audio are very good as on the previous Seasons.  I did notice an issue with formatting on my modern HD BluRay player.  There were thick black bars on the left and right sides of the screen.  I remembered someone complaining about this with Season 4 but at the time I still used my old VHS/DVD combo unit from 2005 and I didn't have the issue then.  Well after messing around with the screen settings on my BluRay player for several minutes to no avail I tried it in my old combo unit which I rarely play DVDs on now, and sure enough it formatted it correctly!  The picture is not quite as bright and vivid as on the HD BluRay player, but at least it fills up the screen.  I may still contact Sony and see if there is any way to format it correctly on the BluRay unit, but for now I am satisfied I can watch it without those annoying black borders!  Had I not gotten it to format on the older player I probably would have rated it 4 Stars, but luckily it worked on my old unit.  I have hundreds of DVD sets and have been using the BluRay player for almost a year now and this is the first time this has happened.  Maybe it will be a more common issue on recently issued sets?  I hope not.  I am so glad we don't have to wait another year for the last Season!

It appears that beginning with Season 4 and continuing with Season 5 and soon to be released Season 6, that the ability to expand/adjust to full=screen mode IS NOT AVAILABLE.

8312335,5,B001JAHPRQ,In this season of Chips ends the end for the Larry Willcox who plays officer Jon Baker this is because Eric Estrda who plays officer Frank or better known as Pounch just can not get along with Larry Willcox so he throws A big fit about him so they kick off Larry Willcox witch I think that is why the next season witch was season six was the final season of Chips because the show is not the same without Larry Willcox!  Ponch gets A rematch with A run in with tow old criminals that gets A rematch fight but one of them is still A bad egg!  Planty of car pile ups and car fires and also car chases!  You will see A male stripper dressed as A cop at A strip club joint!  You will see animals stealing money this and much much more!,1518307200,,731,3.9863013698630136
