This is volume 1 of 8
The story starts out with an ordinary, but very cute girl, Sasami who is blessed with perfect parents. Somehow as the perfect kid, fate has her selected to represent a candidate queen from an alien world in a magical competition. She gets magical powers and a cabbit (cat-bunny like creature) to assist her. This first volume tells the story of how Sasami comes to reluctantly accept her role as a magical girl. It also introduces her rival (representing the alternate queen candidate) Pixy Misa. The second episode has a hilarious ""music video"" segment with the Pixy Misa song.
In a way it's a spoof of the Sailor Moon magical girl series, but it has a special sweetness that lets it stand out on its own. Those who don't like things ""too cute"" should stay away from this one. Everyone else should like it.
Pretty Sammy fanatics know that 4 different instances of this series exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. Next came the OVA, and finally this Magical Project S TV series.
Pretty Sammy is so cute, you might just eventually want to see all of these. ^_^",1014854400,,1440,4.5852713178294575
7909077,5,B00000G3DW,"This is a Very energic series about Sasami Kawaii. Shes a normal fourth grader until tsunami Chooses her to Clense the earth of evil. On top of that tsunamis rival Romia (well tsunami likes romia..but romia doesnt like tsunami) ALSo has a magical girl trying to mess up earth to become the Queen of juraihelm. A magic kingdom.
  You MIGHT be expecting a Tenchi muyo Run off with pretty sammy and all the characters fighting. like.. the magical girl pretty sammy vidoes.  But they seem almost like diffrent charcaters alltogether.  For one thing there is no TENCHI!!! Ryoko or ayeka. But it would be a great series if you never even heard of tenchi muyo.  Since it is very funny. And also very cute.. plus they like to make fun of themselves alot. also funny That sasami never wants to turn into pretty sammy cause Her clothes look really bad. She looks exactly the same. but no one seems to notice shes not sasami. (sasami is also wondering about that). But if youve seen Sailor moon. Its mostly a childish spoof of that. (when I say childish I don't mean its for kids, although it could be a adult would like this movie alot too).
  Pretty much like sailor moon. A evil magic girl Raising monsters and sasami beats them up. Although the evil magical girl (pixie misa) is Laugh out loud funny.
  I HIGHLY reccommend you should get this video to see what this series is all about. You shouldnt do what I do (I buy every video in the set so I don't have to wait for them to be delieverd at diffrent times), Because this might be a tad bit too childish for the more mature veiwers out there.  If your looking for the Tenchi muyo type feel You shouldnt look here. but if your looking for the same animation And laugh-out-loud funniness you should check this out.",981072000,3,1758,4.4485981308411215
7909078,5,B00000G3DW,"Not only does Sasami Kawaii have the usual problems of any ordanary kid, she's been chosen as Tsunami's champion in a fight for the throne of Juraihelm as Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.  Little does she know her best  friend has also been choosen to be a Magical Girl by Tsunami's  rival!
Kids would enjoy this video, lots of humor, silly monsters instead  of the usual frightning, action, and intresting characters, but keep in  mind it's subtitled so if your child can't read at a fairly quick pace,  this video isn't for you (unless you want to explain what's happening.  It's a very visual series so it shouldn't be too hard to let kids know the  gist). Lots of refrences to other magical girl shows (such as Sailor Moon)  and tounge-in-cheek humor I found it very entertaining.
This is a  spin-off of the Tenchi universe, so if you like this, you might want to  watch some of the many other Tenchi Muyo series. Be aware, they are a  little more mature than Magical Project S.",950832000,6,976,4.545977011494253
