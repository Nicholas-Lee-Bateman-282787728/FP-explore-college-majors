It had to do with uncovering the body & testing to see if it was Richard III. I found the tape but it noted that it might not play on our Dvd. I put it on my wish list in case it's ever available in US.",1489190400,,327,3.4794520547945207

8572376,5,B00BQ2O3Q8,"Those who feel that the history written by Tudor's official biographers is correct will dislike the film.

Those who have dug deeper, who have read of Richard's incredible benevolence, refusing gifts from ordinary people while on Progress (which was the custom of the time), his administration of the north of England which led to such love of him that they never accepted Henry Tudor (the city of York in particular), and his carrying out of duties assigned him by his brother Edward IV, including being named Protector of his nephews and the likelihood that Tudor, in fact, murdered them...all will appreciate this film.

In other words, anyone who has been able to research further and have been astounded by what they found, like me, will appreciate this very much.

Those who simply accept the works of lazy historians (e.g. Alison Weir and others) will not appreciate it.

Richard was certainly not hated during his rule.  Even Vergil, Tudor's official biographer, never stayed any such thing - nor did Tudor ever accuse Richard of murdering his nephews.",1408752000,13,1060,5.0
8572377,3,B00BQ2O3Q8,"I'm not sure why Richard III inspires either hatred or denial, but some of the latter is a reaction to the former.  When people claim him as a usurper amd murderer, hated in his own time, they are wilfully blinkered.  The real usurper was Henry VII, whose claim to the throne was through a female line (a dubious claim at the time), and an illegitimate one.  As for murderer, Henry had the Earl of Warwick locked up at ten years old, to be eventually beheaded over a trumped-up charge.  And that's history, not guesswork as are the supposed murders of the two Princes.",1387238400,9,568,4.485436893203883
8572378,1,B00BQ2O3Q8,"Rubbish!.
Yet another attempt to present the bloody tyrant Richard as something better than he actually was. Forget Shakespeare,Richard was hated and feared in his own time for being the merciless usurper that he was. He single-handedly destroyed the Yorkist cause by his savage and illegal grab for the throne,but mostly by his cold-blooded murder of the two young Princes in the Tower of London. This man will always be damned for his evil deeds.'Ricardians' will love it of course as they love anything that serves to keep them in their preposterous denial.",1386806400,3,560,5.032258064516129
8572379,2,B00BQ2O3Q8,Poorly conceived and poorly put together.. nothing new except the pictures of the skeletal remains. For anyone interested in Richard III it is a disappointment.,1380499200,10,160,5.44
