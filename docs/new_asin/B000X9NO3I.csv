8227411,5,B000X9NO3I,"Whole Earth Films interview maintains its strong track record with this video.  The viewer gets an inside look at the 20th century role of the nuclear power industry and its prospects.

Topics such as output, reliability, and waste transport and storage are covered, one-by-one, until there is very little left to wonder about.  While nuclear physics and technology are normally arcane topics, Dr. Richard (""Rip"") Anderson uses his unusual expertise to bring these topics down to earth.

Nuclear energy is a choice and alternative to coal.  There aren't many choices when it comes to baseload power.  Society needs to make the right choice.  France gets 80% of baseload power with virtually no CO2 or toxic pollution during operation.  The U.S. can emulate France when it comes to power stations.  Just ask Rip Anderson and Gwyneth Cravens, or check out their videos and books.",1386374400,,877,5.076923076923077

They knew all the material and had many slides available, but didn't seem to have an outline or even to have done a practice presentation to iron out the kinks. What is recorded here it an honest discussion, with moderator/interviewer to guide and clarify points along the way. Energy needs around the world are a hidden, yet important, driver of both industry and culture. Though 21st century growth will happen primarily in '3rd world nations', the generation and use of energy needs to be intentially guided in every country. Increased efficiency - whether in generating or use - of energy is only part of the solution. The type of power plant is important: coal, NG, and petroleum use is destroying our world (CO2, ocean PH, destruction of wildlife, armed conflicts to control industrial resources, etc). Hydro, solar, and wind are not enough, even with 1000% increased efficiency, to give the world it's anticipated electrical consumption 20 years from now - let alone into the 22nd century. Their safety records are rather poor as well. Nuclear has an admirable safety record though. Looking at deaths, civilian nuclear in 60 years has a comparable number of deaths as most other power sources do in a single decade.

One of the authors, Cravens, was highly skeptical of nuclear. As she began to do research on nuclear articles she wanted to write, she found much that went unreported. The truth is that nearly all front-page stories get wild head-lines and 90 second presentations of 'possible future problems' on the news; and that an unbiased 5 minute story might leave the public with a very different view of nuclear. If we wish to power 22nd century cities we need a better model. Replacing coal and eventually NG with 4th generational nuclear is the only viable solution. By the 22nd century, I'd hope that all currently used nuclear designs (which are 2nd and 3rd gen reactors designed in the 1950's-70's!) will also be replaced with 4th gen small modular reactors (SMR) and that every county and city had 2-5 SMR's.

Very readable yet lots of facts. No emotion, just answers.
Nothing like an environmentalist endorsing nuclear power.",1252022400,2,308,5.4375
