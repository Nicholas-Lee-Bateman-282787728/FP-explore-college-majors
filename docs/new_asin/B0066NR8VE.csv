8494121,1,B0066NR8VE,"Plot:
Released from prison he seeks revenge by killing the 12 jurors who convicted him and then cutting their faces off to be mounted on styrofoam modeling heads. The most graphic scene occurs at the start when the killer, while driving his pickup (of course), pulls up along side another car (at 60 mph) and with a shotgun blows the head off of that juror driver. When you slow it down the use of a stunt prosthetic becomes obvious. As far as horrific the rest of the movie contains just a couple of extremely quick scenes showing the start of peeling an obvious plastic prosthetic face from doomed jurors. Killer has the usual farm house and masked looked.

Problems:
Another movie that was made years ago with little audience interest and now being released on DVD most likely to recoup losses. The script and/or editing is jumbled and disjointed as people appear without much backstory and then disappear often off screen. Nothing memorable in the script that we haven't seen before - just different actors at a different location and even the ending was anticlimactic predictable. Novice acting and lack of character depth made me care less about the predictable outcome resulting in lots of fast forwarding.",1331769600,3,1213,4.859903381642512
