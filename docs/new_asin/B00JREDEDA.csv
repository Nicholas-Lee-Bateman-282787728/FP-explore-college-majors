8653541,5,B00JREDEDA,Really helpful video. Made some of the mysteries about SLR photography much clearer.,1497744000,,84,5.538461538461538
8653542,5,B00JREDEDA,Michael's videos are very easy to follow and understand. I have watched him on youtube several times. Recommend this to anyone starting out in photographer. I bought this video for my father in-laws girl friend to help her learn her camera.,1485302400,,240,4.878048780487805
8653543,5,B00JREDEDA,"I love this training course! My husband gifted me with a Nikon D3300 and Michael's training DVD. If it were not for this tutorial, I would still be shooting on auto. I could start using the features of my new camera immediately after watching the training. I have watched it several times and learn something new every time. I highly recommend this crash course for beginning photographers!",1470614400,,390,4.835820895522388

8653546,5,B00JREDEDA,"I will review this DVD giving information on reasons why I wanted this item, delivery time, pros and cons, and whether I would recommend this to a friend and why/not.

Reasons why I wanted this item
First of all, I own a Nikon D3300 for a while now but I never had the time to sit and read the manual or take advantage of all the settings in the camera because I didn't know how to use the camera. I decided I needed someone to explain to me how to use it.

Delivery time
The delivery time was excellent. The item arrived within 1/2 business days. (FYI: I have an Amazon prime membership)

Pros
The dvd course is excellent. It not only covers basic and essential photography concepts, but it also pinpoints specific information on the Nikon D3300. Michael is very clear in his explanations and he makes these concepts easy to understand. Yes, it's true that the dvd is homemade (as I read in a previous review) but that doesn't make it less valuable. The price I paid was right if you consider actually attending a photography class. Plus, you can watch it as many times as you need.

Cons
I didn't find anything that I disliked about it.

I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I can also watch this dvd as many times as I need (that's the advantage of having it at home). Thanks Michael, you rock.",1435190400,2,1307,4.384297520661157
8653547,4,B00JREDEDA,Very informative for new user,1425859200,,29,5.0
8653548,5,B00JREDEDA,"There's so much valuable information in this crash course DVD. How could you not absolutely love it? The best part is that I can watch it over and over again, if I forget how to do something, without going back to an instructor (who I would probably have to spend money to get advice from) or trying relentlessly to find the answer through google searches. I would recomend this video for beginners like me. Thank you! Great video!",1400284800,,431,4.538461538461538
8653549,5,B00JREDEDA,"I would recommend beginners, those who are unfamiliar with Nikon or this camera, and those who want to learn how to take amazing photos in an artistic way to buy this video. I loved how Michael walks through what everything means on your display. I certainly would purchase this DVD for a friend who might have this camera. I give this DVD 5 stars!",1400284800,,348,4.453125
8653550,2,B00JREDEDA,This is not a professional video. It is clips of many different video teachings over the years by an amateur video maker. It does have some good information but should be sold at your local Walmart store as a bargain $5 to $8 DVD. Michael states he was a teacher as well as a photographer. At times his training makes you feel your back in 3rd grade. If I had purchased this DVD at $5 to $10 I would have rated it 3 stars.,1398902400,,422,4.035714285714286
