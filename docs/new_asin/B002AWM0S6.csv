3892740,5,B002AWM0S6,"I've seen the entire anime series and both seasons of the live action TV series.  I don't really have much to say about the movie, other than that it was very gratifying to get both another dose of this fun J-Drama, as well as a bit of closure.  The movie manages to maintain much of the character (and all of the actors) of the TV series, without really feeling like just a long episode.  While it's not exactly a cinematic masterpiece, it accomplishes what it sets out to do and should fulfill most viewers' expectations.

This 2-disc edition contains the theatrical release, the directors cut (which I have yet to watch), and a good collection of extras (a press conference, trailers, making of, and outtakes).  I was quite satisfied with the video quality, and the cinematography wasn't bad, either.  These goodies & the quality of the release easily push it up to 5 stars.

If you enjoyed the live action series, you know you want to watch this.  Here's your chance to support the creators, too.",1254528000,,1000,4.642045454545454
3892741,3,B002AWM0S6,"If you are not a fan, I highly recommend you check out the whole of this series: Hana Yori Dango (also known as Boys Over Flowers), which is based on the very popular girls' manga (comic book) series in Japan with the same name.

(This paragraph describes the back-story to the movie, feel free to skip it if you like). Hana Yori Dango (HYD) follows the trials and tribulations of a very spunky and outspoken middle-class girl, Tsukushi Makino, who is currently attending an elite private high school for the wealthy sons and daughters of plutocrats. The original series goes through the problems she encounters, both on the class-difference basis, and because she provokes the big, bad, wealthy bully on campus - Tsukasa Domiyoji - the leader of the F4. The F4 (or ""Flower 4"" - very scary, right?) is actually comprised of the four richest guys on campus, who basically own the school. When Makino stands up to Domiyoji, he decides to make her life and school a living hell. However, the one bright spot in Makino's life is Rui Hanazawara, who is one of the F4, and ends up saving her from a lot of the bullying.  A love triangle develops, however, as Domiyoji starts developing feelings for Makino, and Makino falls for Rui.

The final installment to this series picks up where the TV story left off, and is an original story - not found with in the original manga - about Makino and Domiyoji getting ready for their wedding. Makino is plagued with doubt that maybe this relationship can't work out after all. Despite their mutual love for each other, will that really be enough to overcome the obstacles of class differences and their different dreams?

The story starts out where Makino is presented with a wedding gift from her future mother-in-law. The tiara, called ""The Smile of Venus"", has been handed down for generations and is a symbol for eternal love. Unfortunately, the night after she is given the present, the tiara is stolen. Makino and Domiyoji are then sent on a mad goose-chase to take down the thief and bring back the tiara. During the journey, their relationship is tested on multiple levels: of trust and of faith in each other and their friends.

While I won't give away the ending, I will say this is a cute movie, that fans will really enjoy. Those new to the series could probably enjoy it as an adventure/mystery story on its own (although they might not get all the inside jokes), that shows the power of love, and what ""eternal love"" really is. All of this wrapping up the series in a cute, pink bow.

--------
Edit on 9/23/2012:  I realize I didn't explain in my review why I gave it 3 stars out of 5. The reason is, while I'm a HUGE fan of the television series and the characters (truly, there is a reason why this series was a huge hit in Japan). The characters were compelling, the tension, the build-up, and conflicts were well-developed and executed. There was wonderful dramatic scenes as well as hilarious comedic scenes.

I felt that, for all the glory of the show, this movie was more of the ""sugar-coated dessert"" for the fans, but it's nothing to sink your teeth into. The goal of this movie was give the fans what they wanted, which was touching scenes with Makino and Domiyouji, seeing our well-loved characters again, and tying the whole plot with a shiny pink bow. In that way, it succeed. It was also cool to see Makino & Domiyouji traveling the globe, and had a chance to go to different places like Las Vegas and China... that was the highlight of the movie, for me.

In its own right, however, as a ""movie"", and also as an addition to the over-arching story, I felt that it let me down. I didn't feel there was much conflict, and whatever conflict was there was felt forced and artificial. While the plot was to ""test"" the true love of our characters, this is something that had happened in the past, with the television show (in different ways, of course), so I wasn't convinced that anything was really ""on-the-line"" for our heroes. We all know it was going to be a happy ending.

Again, if you're looking for a frothy dessert, this might do the trick. And its something every ""Hana-dan"" fan should watch. But I felt that this movie did not do what the series had done to me in the past (pull at the heart-strings, and make me care for these wonderful, alive characters).",1251244800,4,4326,4.570322580645161

3892743,5,B002AWM0S6,"This got a little weird.  I had the impression they were really struggling for plot with the film.  Some of the island adventure was flat strange, but Matsumoto Jun looks great.  Can't figure out why they weren't a little more romantic.  They were married after all.  The explanation at the end was very weak.  Still it was fun.",1426982400,,328,4.568965517241379

Both DVDs have English subtitles. The quality was poor that's why I gave 4 stars. Overall, the story was funny-romantic, good for all ages.",1409011200,,308,4.811320754716981
3892745,5,B002AWM0S6,"The script and actors are excellent. The scenery is breath taking. There is a continuance of the end of the original  Anime version. This movie give closure to the series. Has a happy ending with the characters finally able to be together without the rest of their world trying to pull them apart.

The groom-to-be is from an extremely wealthy family, while his bride-to-be is from common folk. This part of the story follows their trials and tribulations as they approach the big wedding day.

I showed this to high school students learning Japanese, and they loved it. The video has romance and comedy, along with non-stop action. The very end was a bit slow, but up until then, there was never a dull moment.

This video would also be entertaining for adults who wanted some light entertainment. Also, the English subtitles are quite good.",1306713600,4,648,4.828828828828829

3892750,5,B002AWM0S6,I loved the manga so I decided to watch the movie. It was great and the ending was better than the manga. Both Masumoto Jun and Inoue Mao are great actors. But most of the characters don't look good at all. They are not eye candy. That was the most visible drawback of the movie. But even then its just a minor drawback. Overall  a great movie.,1267488000,3,344,4.134328358208955
3892751,4,B002AWM0S6,"Hana Yori Dango Final was great, especially the director's cut.  It has more of those lovey-dovey scenes.  This movie is really different form the live action tv series as it is much more romantic.  It is almost a different style all together, but it is refreshing in a way.  It's nice to finally see Makino and Domiyoji officially together for more than half an episode like it was during the tv series (anyone familiar with the series knows that they would constantly break-up and get back together).  The reason I'm only giving it four stars is because I just think I like the tv series better.  I know the foucs for the movie was the lovely couple, but I felt that this movie really left out too much of the other characters and other funny elements that made the series so great. Also I wanted more closure on other things, like Makino's career as a lawyer and whatnot.  But overall this movie has a great storyline and was a nice ending to a beautiful series, although I wouldn't mind another movie ! ha ha I absolutely love Hana Yori Dango.",1257033600,6,1047,4.478947368421053

8360562,5,B002AWM0S6,I haven't seen any reviews for this yet so I figure ill put in my two cents. I have been a fan of this series for several years now I am a big fan of the anime but haven't owned the complete series up until now. I guess Discotek license rescued this title from Viz they had previously released the show several years ago complete with dub treatment and all but when they did they never released the box set so the series was only available in singles. That version is out of print now so online mostly all you will find are second hand copies that cost more than you might want to pay. I used to own one of them they were nice but this is a much better value. This version comes with the whole series as well as the movie that I believe was never available before the episodes have not been redubbed or anything like that this is the same dub that was available on the previous release this to me is a huge plus because that is the version that I am fond of if you don't feel the same way then of course you have the option to just watch the Japanese version with subtitles. I am glad to finally own the complete series but I guess this set has short comings I like the color of the box its nice but i think its a shame that the F4 all have their back to the camera so you don't get any view of their faces at all. The set includes 7 discs and they all have disc art on them but unfortunately they all have the same picture of Tsukushi  on them. The menu is very plain as well there is no character art or animation on it or anything  but I mention these things only because if I recall correctly the Viz release had more character art on the discs that included the supporting characters and animation on the DVD menus. The thing that bugs me most about this release is that they overlap discs on top of another on the case this is a pet peeve of mine and it's difficult to release the discs from the case. If you plan on marathoning the series you might want to take all of the discs out and put them in sleeves or something.,1485907200,4,2027,4.039800995024875
8360563,1,B002AWM0S6,too fake,1484438400,,8,3.5
8360564,5,B002AWM0S6,"I'm about half way through this anime. I really love it I bough it because I had seen boys over flowers the korean live action with lee min ho. But this one has like alot more to it and alot more character development. In this anime there is like 2 love interest one is sweet basically prince charming. And the other is almost down right abusive and mean but both are rich. My main problem is one character was almost so abusive it was to much, he also pretty much attacked her pinned her down just to kiss her um no thanks it kinda seemed like he might rape her heck even the main character though it too. There is Nothing attractive about a mean guy. But anyway other than that the anime was great. You can read about the description on amain so there's not much to say bout that.",1483315200,2,782,4.185430463576159
8360565,2,B002AWM0S6,"I liked the series a lot. Which is something, considering I'm far from a teenager. It was well made. The plot had enough conflict and sweetness without overdoing any of it (well, maybe the last hurdle, with the memory loss, was a bit too much, but hey, it went down well), the characters were very well drawn and all given some space (except for poor Akira, who hardly got any story or any lines), and very little farce and buffoonery (except for her parents). I liked the development of the character of the male lead. Of course there was a major hole in the plot: people who can be so vicious to the point of almost raping a girl, cannot then become such sweet angels. But having swallowed this, the rest went down pretty well.

Now, the film is quite another thing. There is no real conflict. After all the things this relationship has gone through, it has come out strengthened, so why invent new problems out of the blue?
Whatever conflict happens between the two lovebirds is during their trip, so after the whole thing was started. And the conflict happens because they make poor Domyoji revert to his old violent and shouting self. Didn't they realize that he had become a different person by the end of the series?
 Everybody during the series was saying how because of Makino he was a changed man etc... And now they show him as a jerk again, because the manga source was finished, the writers were on their own,and they couldn't come up with any fresh ideas. Sorry guys, but you should go back to doing adaptations, invention is not your forte!

Then, the trials. The first one, with the tiara, how was it a trial? It didn't put the relationship to the test more than any trip would. Everyone knows that going on a trip with a person, even your best friend, and being with them 24/7 you risk coming back as enemies.

SPOILERS AHEAD

Only the island was a real trial. Maybe they got the idea from some reality show.... But what a reckless idea! What if the bear killed the girl? What if they both died of avitaminosis or poisoning from eating some unknown fruit? Was someone watching them? I don't think so.

I think the tiara symbolism was heavy handed. And I won't even comment on the didascalic nature of when the couple is lying down on the beach and saying ""the lesson"" they learned from their adventure. Or the cloyingly sugary finale. Wrapped in a pink bow, as another excellent review said.
And I agree with that reviewer when he says that here the other characters, especially the trio of friends, are relegated to very minor importance, with nothing to do but smile sweetly. We miss the humorous flavour of their scenes, which was such a big part of what we loved in the series.

The ending is so preposterous you don't know whether to laugh or puke.
All the wedding guests had to wait for who knows how many hours, while these two people, coming from a desert island, had a bath, a manicure, their hair was made, and then put on their perfectly fitting clothes, chosen, while they were gone, by their friends who no doubt had a perfect eye as for measurements - they also measured the ring perfectly... But this is nothing. Suppose the guests were seated down for tea and biscuits while waiting for the couple.

But... but... How Rui became a priest and then reverted back to not being one? Or is it the custom in Japan that a random person can perform the sacrament of the wedding? But it cannot be, because everybody in the series was wearing a cross, meaning they are Christians. In Christianity, only an ordained priest can perform a wedding. Is it possible that nobody pointed that out to the writers and director?
But by that point the silliness was such that I just gave up.

I'm sorry, but this movie has left me with a bad taste, like when you feel the urge to eat junk food, and then it's not even tasty, and your stomach grumbles.",1455321600,,3862,4.48221906116643
