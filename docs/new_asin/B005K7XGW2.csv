8476513,5,B005K7XGW2,"I saw this at my buddy's house (in Canada), his whole family was watching it when I walked in. Couldn't stop watching.

The Hockey footage looks classic and crisp. The rest is hilarious.

This is like a Campy/Canadian version of SLAPSHOT.

Whoever put this out deserves a pat on the back.",1407283200,,288,4.607843137254902

8476515,3,B005K7XGW2,"Ok, I will state first what I liked about the movie.  First, had some great old footage (especially the front of the ""The Olympia"" there in Detroit!  What memories!), and reminiscing about everything in the late 60's & early 70's (ads, product placement, cars, parts of Toronto) that puts someone who grew up in that era and in that region of the US/Canada into memory lane.  Secondly, some of the hockey stars in it (George Armstrong for one . .Way to go Chief!) make it really fun to watch.
Ok, now for the bad . .the movie's plot is a bit weak, and the girlfriend character of the ""hockey hero"" is a bit on the annoying side.  Acting is a bit on the ""mechanical"" side, but I have seen FAR worse movies than this.  Nevertheless, this movie holds a sentimental side to it for me, as I was 8 yrs old when my Dad took me to go see it.  But when I watched it again 40 yrs later, didn't have the same appeal to me, so for someone in the modern-day trying to absorb it, they'll probably be bored to death by it.

If you can get it at a decent price, and if the movie holds some sort of sentiment behind it, then I'd say it is a good purchase.  However, anything outside those two caveats and you maybe disappointed.",1349222400,,1211,4.189655172413793
