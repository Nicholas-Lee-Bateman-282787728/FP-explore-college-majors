8186199,5,B000OQDRJG,"This is a profound and moving documentary of Britain's role in the establishment of the State of Israel, but also of their abandonment to live up to their commitments to the international community and the Jewish people. It calls into question whether Britain was truly a friend and ally or rather an unworthy party that acted only in its own self interest, betraying the Jews in their hour or need.",1522108800,,399,4.714285714285714

8186202,5,B000OQDRJG,I think that all people should watch this no matter what side they stand concerning the issues in the Middle East.  Without an understanding of the history of the region--all our opinions are of little consequence. This is extremely well written and documented.  I highly recommend it!!!,1412121600,3,287,5.085106382978723
8186203,5,B000OQDRJG,"This is an excellent review of why Britain and USA did not want to disrupt Palestine by relocating Jews into the region now called Israel.  Historically, other locations had been offered for relocation for many decades; but such did not fit an ideology held by the Jews.  The original plan of trans-Jordan where Palestinians would continue to possess 70% of their land and the remainder was available for an orderly relocation of a limited number of Jews was gradually lobbied away.  Palestinians objected and violently protested as larger re-locations began before WW2, but political pressure... until after WW2 and mass relocation commenced.  Today,  July, 2014, Israel continues to take property, mistreat and encamp the Palestinians in the name of their ideology.",1406678400,2,767,5.305785123966942
