6077970,2,B00GI0SX7S,Teen Titans Go is a great blend of tween slapstick and situations that kids in several age ranges can enjoy...to include adults.  The problem I see with this DVD collection is it's released in 1.33 format full screen.  Really Cartoon Network?!?  Have you looked in any electronic stores in the past five years and seen a 4:3 television.....let me answer that for you.  Nope you haven't.  Why are you publishing the series in a format that is turn of the century???,1390348800,6,464,4.679012345679013
6077971,4,B00GI0SX7S,"I too was a bit thrown astray when I found out that the Teen Titans were getting an entire new series based off of anime chibi-styled comedic versions of themselves. However, upon viewing a few episodes, it's not half bad. It's funny, pokes some jokes at the old series, and just tries to give the viewers a fun and entertaining 11 minutes, which it does a pretty good job of doing.

For all the haters out there, look, I get where you're coming from. You hate to see the awesome, butt-kicking characters you know and love turned into purely comedic characters. I get it. But here's why you shouldn't be mad simply because of that:

-This series has nothing to do with the old series. Other than the fact that it's the same team and they have the same voice actors, this is not a continuation of the story in the old series. This has nothing to do with the old series at all.

If you don't like it because you just don't think it's that funny, that's fine. But don't hate it simply because it's a comedic version of something you liked. Imagine if they made a similar cartoon but with Batman, and he was still voiced by Kevin Conroy. Would you still be mad? Would it be tarnishing the awesomeness that is Batman The Animated Series? Of course not. Heck, if there was ever a series like that, I personally would see it the second it premiered. Why? It has nothing to do with the old series, and is just a comedic version.

Again, I understand for those that still refuse to like it simply because of this, but don't blame Cartoon Network for ""turning the Teen Titans into these childish toon characters!"" The old series is still there, this is not a continuation and has no link to the old series at all. They didn't turn them into anything as this isn't a continuation to that story. They /created/ something new based off of an older series.",1387756800,69,1842,4.408823529411765
6077972,1,B00GI0SX7S,"OMG, I hate this show! I have praised the original 2003-2006 Teen Titans TV series as a masterpiece of animation; I LOVE the characters, the color of the animation, and the balance between action, drama and comedy. THIS show on the other hand is completely idiotic! I don't like the flash animation, I don't like the unrealistic designs, and I don't like how this show focuses more on comedy! That seems weird because I like watching comedy more than action shows, but since this is a superhero show, it doesn't work. I have only seen about a couple episodes and a few clips, and none of them sparked! Robin is an idiot joker (wasn't Beast Boy already supposed to be that character?) and not the brave leader I remember! Oh yes, I almost forgot, the theme song stinks too. I don't even think the comedy pays off! One of the reasons why I loved the original show so much was because I felt it was balanced for kids AND adults! TTG, no! In my opinion, it's just for kids, like maybe 7 year olds! Why didn't DC make a Computer-Animated Teen Titans series like they did with the Green Lantern! I would definitely love to see the Teen Titans in CGI form! Instead I'm stuck with THIS?!! <Groan!> Well, I am just going to continue enjoying the wonderful original show, and continue skipping this idiotic spin- off!",1387238400,13,1307,4.518987341772152
6077973,5,B00GI0SX7S,"Teen Titans Go is absolutely hilarious.  My kids and I are huge fans of the Teen Titans series and we love Teen Titans Go as well.  The self-deprecating humor and inside jokes that occur in the original Teen Titans series are taken to a masterfully absurd extreme in this series.  The episode where they mock Zan & Jana is a work of art that had me laughing so hard I was crying, my kids didn't get it because theyve never seen the old Justice League cartoons, so they thought I had lost my mind.  Naturally, if you are a purist and you have no sense of humor, you will not like this series. If you have any snark in you at all and you are a Teen Titans/DC Comics fan, you will very much appreciate this series.

Have rec'd the DVD and have been watching it with the kids for a couple of weeks now.  Its great, and we love it.  The DVD fills the entire screen on an HDTV.  There is no Surround Sound.  The episode selection menu is klunky.  But, seriously, whatever.  The cartoons are awesome.",1386633600,31,993,4.2287234042553195
6077974,1,B00GI0SX7S,"When Teen Titans aired back in 2003 admittedly it took a while for me to adjust to the look and feel of the show. However as I watched it, I appreciated that it could develop a serious action-based story amidst all the humor.  I trusted Glen Murakami (who had developed his art style from Batman TAS & Superman TAS), and was not disappointed in the end. This show however - ""Teen Titans Go!"" is a Travesty! You remove the best elements of the Teen Titans series, and what is left is a sugar-rush comedy fest only children with ADD could enjoy, sadly matching every other garbage comedy series on CN at present. I understand it is ""supposed"" to be a comedy, but even in that it fails. Nobody from Teen Titans (aside from the voice actors) is involved with this production, that speaks volumes to me. The death of excellent action cartoons has not gone unnoticed by the fan community. All the DC comic and character references in the world cannot make this show decent. Please do not purchase this DVD if you are a fan of action/superhero animated series. But if you are of the group that thinks what CN has now should be considered entertainment, then I guess this show is for you.",1384300800,15,1180,4.488372093023256

6077980,2,B00GI0SX7S,"First let me say the DVD itself is the worst quality,  piece of garbage, it freezes, just stops playing, won't eject from machine etc. The movie bits are ridiculously idiotic, leaning toward a lot of bathroom humor and obscenities without actually saying the words.

6077993,5,B00GI0SX7S,"When my boyfriend and I first saw the commercials for Teen Titans Go!, we were furious. How dare they soil the Teen Titans name like this? How dare they try to recreate what the original Teen Titans show had? How dare they change the art into chibi little versions of themselves? How dare they!

Then we watched it. Then we laughed. Then we watched more. We were so blinded by the nostalgia, we weren't willing to even give this show a chance.

Teen Titans Go! has quickly become our favorite show on Cartoon Network. If you can get past the point this isn't supposed to be in any way related to the previous show, you'll enjoy yourself. I enjoy how Teen Titans Go! pokes fun at itself, at how they have odd little bits of song at dance (see: Robin's chicken dance), and how it's absolutely not serious.

Just don't let nostalgia get in the way of this great show. If the comedy's not for you, then that's fine. It's a kid's show after all.

I'm here though to review the DVD, and not the series itself.
I bought the first season (which is two disks), for my boyfriend for his birthday. He was happy with it. The DVD came in a case that was in great condition, and we've had no problems with it so far.",1444867200,3,1202,4.28193832599119

This show is probably funny if you're 7. My little sister loves it, and she's about that age. For the older crowd, however, it's boring and unamusing. The story lines are trite and are clearly written for young children who can't pay attention to anything for longer than 5 minutes. It's everything YJ wasn't and worse.

We have watched these shows before kids and now share them happily with our 11 and 8 year olds. When my 8 year old stumbled upon Teen Titans Go! on Cartoon Network, we were elated.

It is funny, silly and the jokes can range from potty humor to more grown up innuendos that go flying over my childrens' heads. The characters are wonderfully stereotypical, which would be a complaint from your average tv watcher. But this only adds to the ridiculousness and antics.

These 5 friends and their specific character traits make the show so terribly amusing and the DVDs were a must have for all of us. We can't wait for Season 2 to come out, even though we have seen all of them 200 times each.

The shows are snippets at 11 minutes long. They include songs, jokes that you will repeat (Try NOT repeating 'waffles' 400 times when eating waffles) and fights about burgers vs. tacos that will follow you into any restaurant.

6078044,4,B00GI0SX7S,"Admit it: When you finished seeing the last episode of the original ""Teen Titans"" series, you were kind of missing them already.  Even the ""Trouble in Tokyo"" movie and the comic book series didn't help much either.

Well, now they're back in action no matter how much you demanded it in a brand-new series that's slightly more crazy-mixed-up than the last.  But I think the best thing about ""Teen Titans Go"" is hearing the original voice cast again.  They are, by the way: Scott Menville (""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"", ""Robotomy""), Greg Cipes (""Ben 10 Alien Force"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""), Khary Payton, (""Codename: Kids Next Door"", ""Dead or Alive"" games), Hynden Walch (""Adventure Time"", ""Kid Icarus: Uprising""), and Tara Strong (""Powerpuff Girls"", ""Chowder"", ""Ben 10"", ""The Fairly Odd Parents"", ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"", ""Lollipop Chainsaw"" - don't ask).

And with great talent, comes brand-new super-heroic adventures such as:

""Legendary Sandwich"" - Raven sends the other Titans on a quest for ingredients to make a special sandwich that could grant immortality.
""Pie Bros"" - Beast Boy tries to earn money for a birthday present for Cyborg by working at the new pie shop in town.
""Driver's Ed"" - Robin has to take a driving test to renew his license, but little does he know he's a getaway driver for his ""instructor"".
""Laundry Day"" - After a dirty day cleaning up crime, the Teen Titans need to wash their super suits, but who gets to do this thankless task ?
""Hey, Pizza"" - Beast Boy and Cyborg fruitlessly try to hinder their pizza deliveries so they can get free pizza.  Meanwhile, Robin is at a toss-up for building a senior citizen center for the elderly and a community pool so he can ogle at a bikini-clad Starfire.
""Girls Night Out"" - When the guys head out for a night on the town, Starfire decides to do the same with Raven and convict Jinx who are both reluctant.
""You're Fired"" - Beast Boy gets kicked out of the Teen Titans and is replaced by...  The Wonder Twins ?!
""Staff Meeting"" - Robin breaks his old staff and goes on a quest to find a new one.
""Artful Dodgers"" - The Titans take on the HIVE in a game of dodgeball, and they're not gonna back down even if they lose.
""Burger vs. Burrito"" - What's tastier, Cyborg's burgers or Beast Boy's burritos ?  Only a Titan taste test and an ultimate food fight will decide.
""The Left Leg"" - When Robin is forced to operate the left leg of Cy's new fighting robot, he'll have to do his best in accepting his new role.

So with these episodes and more, you'll know that it's never a dull moment in the life of a superhero.  Look for volume two of the first season as well as new episodes of the Titans' second season Thursday nights on Cartoon Network !",1408492800,4,2744,4.602459016393443

6078046,2,B00GI0SX7S,"I'm not giving this a low review because of the content. I actually like this show, it's something I like to watch after a stressful day at work to unwind, because of the silliness.

The reason I'm giving this a low rating is because of the format.
""Season 1, Part 1""? Why not give us the entire season?

After all, each of the episodes are only 12 minutes long. You could easily fit the entire season onto the disc. Why not do that?

I'm sorry, but I'll be more interested in this when complete seasons/collections are released.",1405468800,,529,4.43298969072165

So, I ended up watching it on youtube. Not on netflix. However, I watched the regular show and found out it was good, but not as good as teen titans go. BUT, this dvd collection only has THIRTEEN  episodes! I mean, really? Thats the only reason why its four stars. But maybe I'll get it, or wait until part two (or season two?) comes out. The youtube selection is REALLY limited because the warner bros ones don't load. By the way, all you ttg haters out there: this is takes a more funny approach to teen titans, and that makes it better. I like serious and funny shows myself. BOTH of them. So, really, start expandiy your mindset and enjoy this show.

6078050,5,B00GI0SX7S,"As a preschool teacher and a father of two young boys (2 and 6), I am well aware of how much love exists for superheroes among young children, especially boys. But there are very few cartoons made these days that feature superheroes that are fun, light-hearted, humorous and still action-packed. Teen Titans Go! is that show. It is extremely funny and highly entertaining for both my boys and for me. Many fans of the old Teen Titans show will bemoan the cartoonish, silly elements of this new TTG show, but I would guess that most of them are not watching that show with young children. Bruce Timm is extremely talented and I am a huge fan of his artwork, but the dark, serious tone that his landmark show Batman: the Animated Series ushered in led to an overall trend toward overly grave and dark animation that is still being felt today. Much like Alan Moore's inadvertent darkening of comics in the late 80's with the effect his masterpiece, The Watchmen, had on the comics industry, Timm's BTAS has set not only the bar, but the tone for every other animated superhero series that has come after it. Bruce Timm's animated DC shows are great, but he himself says they are not intended to younger viewers. But the pervasive dark and violent tone in superhero shows creates a huge problem for any parent of a superhero-loving youngster that wants to watch heroes in action. Teen Titans Go! is a perfect blend of light-hearted entertainment with tons of effective humor and likable characters. I HIGHLY recommend it to any parent that has a kid who loves superheroes but is too young to the many dark superhero shows out there. About the only other modern superhero show that hits the same mark is Marvel's Superhero Squad - also fun and funny. It's too bad that most other superhero shows have to be written for older kids or even adult-level in their tone. There are so many younger children who enjoy these characters too. Thank goodness for Youtube and DVDs of the many lighter superhero shows of the past like Superfriends, Spider-man and his Amazing Friends, and The New Adventures of Batman.",1398902400,3,2099,4.706521739130435

6078052,5,B00GI0SX7S,My 6-year-old son absolutely loves these DVDs and watches them all the time - one on the TV in the living room and one on his portable DVD player in the car.  He repeats them almost word for word and just laughs all the time while watching it.  I think they're hilarious and silly and just perfect for my son.,1398038400,2,309,4.133333333333334
6078053,5,B00GI0SX7S,"I've watched ALL of the episodes on BOTH DVDS already, and I think that this series is hysterical! I like the original Teen Titans series, but I like this one because there's more comedy!",1397779200,,187,4.529411764705882
6078054,4,B00GI0SX7S,"...and that's why I like this show! I know that it ticks a lot of people off that these are not the ""serious,"" kick-butt Teen Titans that they know and love from the other series, but I like them this way. Not being much into superheroes anyway, I personally don't mind at all that this isn't yet another show about superheroes stomping super-villain butt and saving the day (and the world, and the universe, and other worlds and universes, etc.). It's purely for comedy, which I greatly appreciate!
There's a lot of good stuff on this show (and on these DVDs) for those who are willing to check out the show and aren't so vehemently opposed to the idea of the TT being ""re-done"" as a bunch of TRULY comical characters as to  literally refuse to like the show or even give it a chance. As Starfire says in one of these episodes, ""Haters gonna hate."" But for those who don't insist on or persist in hating the show because it doesn't try to be like the original series (or ANY more ""usual"" superhero show), there's much entertainment and enjoyment (and many laughs) to be found here!
There's plenty here to tickle the funny bone, from the Titans seeking the ingredients for the ultimate sandwich; to overly-vigilant Robin trying to learn to relax; to the team trying to decide who's going to do the laundry; to Silkie escaping from the Tower and (obliviously) having a wild adventure; to Cyborg and Beast Boy trying desperately to get a pizza for free; to Robin getting actual superpowers; to BB teaching honest Starfire how to tell lies; to Raven cracking a tooth; to Robin seeking a magical replacement for his broken staff; to Cy and BB battling it out with each other over whether burgers or burritos are better; to Raven being split into five different versions of herself with different personalities... and more! While those examples, or most of them, may make it sound like the episodes are about things so mundane that they couldn't possibly be funny, hilarity and wacky twists and turns abound in them and in the others!
(By the way, keep an eye [and an ear] out for the many ""Bat-jokes"" in the episodes!)

Below is a listing of the episodes on the DVDs. Rather than having two (or even more) episodes (or ""shorts"") to a track, as many cartoon DVDs do, the discs have each episode on its own track (which I'm grateful for):
Disc 1: 1. Legendary Sandwich 2. Pie Bros 3. Driver's Ed 4. Dog Hand 5. Double Trouble 6. The Date 7. Dude Relax! 8. Laundry Day 9. Ghostboy 10. La Larva De Amor 11. Hey Pizza! 12. Gorilla 13. Girl's Night Out
Disc 2: 1. You're Fired! 2. Super Robin 3. Tower Power 4. Parasite 5. Starliar 6. Meatball Party 7. Staff Meeting 8. Terra-ized 9. Artful Dodgers 10. Burger Vs. Burrito 11. Matched 12. Colors Of Raven 13. The Left Leg

No it's not educational, it's just silly , but has us watching it as a family which is also quite important. My 8 yr old lives Robin because he can relate to the character always doubting himself but being a true leader. My honey loves Cyborg because he thinks everything that comes out of his mouth is hilarious, and is voiced well. My fav and my 3 yr olds favorite is Beast boy. His character is a party animal and someone you would want at your party. I was so tired of watching Spongebob with my kids and annoyed at Sesame Streets, this is funny and refreshing, but don't take it too seriously , it's just a silly cartoon.",1394755200,2,743,4.23943661971831

This one is more about the team being hyper-active and over the top silly. It's all the goofy aspects of the original series magnified by a million. I don't like it as much as the previous series, but it's better than no Teen Titans at all. I'll still gladly take it. :)",1394323200,2,478,4.443181818181818
6078059,5,B00GI0SX7S,"I have not seen the DVD's, but if there's any episode that sets the tone is the episode, ""Legs"". It's the story of when Cyborg absconds with Raven's cloak. Everyone is amazed seeing Raven's legs, especially Beast Boy who just can't stop ogling her gams. The wearing of Raven's cloak begins to have a dark effect on Cyborg's personality. Meanwhile, Raven becomes Lady Legasus, even more superpowered than Raven herself. She wears a yellow costume with a leg on the front of her new costume using her new superpowers. If you're expecting the classic series, you'll be quite disappointed as this is an entirely different take on the original series.

6078060,4,B00GI0SX7S,When the original series in 2003 came out I loved Star Fire and Raven's new look compared to their comic book counterparts but Cyborg and others new looks took some getting us to. When I heard they were going to re-make it with the same voice actors I thought it was going to pick up where old series left off.  Despite that Jinx is no longer dating Kid Flash and the titans are meeting Terra all over again for the first time this series had its mixture of really funny and really stupid episodes.  I watch the series enough on TV that getting the DVD makes it worth wild for me.,1393545600,2,580,4.216216216216216
6078061,5,B00GI0SX7S,"When I first saw that they were cancelling Young Justice in favor for Teen Titans Go, I was very conflicted.  I loved the old Teen Titans series, and I loved Young Justice.  Watching the minute-or-so long shorts Cartoon Network began airing during commercials swayed me, though.  This series is brilliant (and it's got all the same voice actors as the original series, which is fantastic -- it just wouldn't be the same with different people doing the voices).

No, it's not as serious as YJ or TT.  But it's not trying to be.  This is a show filled with ""soft"" moments.  We've had 7 years of the Titans doing serious and dire missions (five for TT and 2 for YJ), and I, for one, welcome the change.  Not that anything is wrong with the serious stuff, but without the lighter moments, the moments that show the characters outside of missions, the moments that show the characters interacting with each other when the world isn't about to blow up -- without these moments, you forget why the Titans are so close and and why they work so well together.

This show is way more about the Titans relationships with each other in their off time.  The way they goof off and the way they prank and they way they relax with each other (and there's quite a bit of shipping, too).

If Scrubs was nothing but people dying, then J.D. and Turk and Elliot rushing in to save their lives, it wouldn't be nearly as good a show.  Scrubs is a great show because most of the show takes place OUTSIDE of the ""saving"" bit.  It's a great show because it's more about the characters being around each other and making jokes and having relationships and just hanging out.

That's what this show is.  No, it's not super action packed, but it is humor-packed.  If you were a fan of episodes like the one where Robin leaves for the day, so the rest of the Titans sneak into his room and dress up like him, then this show is definitely for you.  I mean, there was an episode that just aired where the Titans fight the Hive in the first 20 seconds of the episode, but then the next 10 minutes of the episode are about Cyborg and Jinx secretly dating behind everyone's back.  The whole series is just hilarious, and it's filled with tons and tons of Easter Eggs for those with a quick eye.

I'm a die-hard Titans fans.  I own both TT and YJ on DVD, and I've read most every TT and YJ comic book (every iteration, 80's to New 52).  And I have absolutely no problem with saying that this series is not only phenomenal, but it is easily in my top 3 runs of the team.

If you're on the fence because you're a die-hard fan of the old series or of the Young Justice series, give it a chance.  I promise you won't regret it.",1393286400,26,2686,4.317365269461078
6078062,5,B00GI0SX7S,"Pay them no mind. Teen Titans Go is an uproariously funny sendup of the original series that ended nearly eight years ago. It is understandable that so many fans of that series would like to see more of it. But despite the fact that i reached a broad and often unintended audience, Teen Titans was meant to be children's entertainment. Having ended so long ago, Warner Bros. Animation has no financial reason to continue or resurrect it--the audience they want to attract simply has no attachment to it. The fact that Teen Titans Go, a comedy series based on the same basic character designs from Teen Titans and staring all the original voice talent, even exists is a minor miracle. The sooner you get over the fact that Teen Titans was a great animated series that has run it's course, the more you'll come to love Teen Titans Go.

TTG is not the old Teen Titans series. It never tries to be, either. But if you were a fan of it, and come to Go with an open mind, you'll find a lot of uproarious comedy and good old-fashioned entertainment. Sure, maybe TTG won't be the kind of show with epic dramatic moments and setpiece battles you'll remember years from now, but that's not what it's going for. TTG never fails to put a smile on my face. Nothing is too sacred, and there is almost an in-joke to the whole thing that if you are actually watching this and remember the old series, you must be hella old. The characters are humorous carictatures of themselves and they're both fun and funny. I think we can all agree on how good Teen Titans was. Teen Titans Go pays homage to it by reminding us all not to take it so seriously. Enjoy TTG for what it is and you'll get a lot out of it. You can cling to the past and vow to keep yourself ""Pure"" if you wish, but in the end, you're only depriving yourself.",1392940800,6,1806,4.34319526627219
6078063,5,B00GI0SX7S,"Yes, this isn't the Teen Titans you knew before, really don't even think about this as part of the cannon because it's not. No if you were to connect this to cannon, it would probally be a TV show designed by The Creeper to make fun of the titans. Take it for what it's worth, a hilarious TV show that would easily stand up to shows like Adventure Time, or Regular Show, but due to the main characters being known superheros with known backgrounds, most fans of the old show will pass this off, and most who would get into this would pass as well. I was luckily enough to catch an episode while channel surfing, and I'm so glad I did. This has some of the best humor, and it gets better the more you know about DC.
