3868652,1,B0027UY87M,"I want to give this a rating of 0 stars. Everyone needs to look at their disclaimer. This series DOES NOT PLAY ON ANY devices in the U.S. Or Canada. I bought it and didn't see that and now I either have to keep the series or spend more of my money to send it back. I grew up on this show and wanted my children to see it. I've never had a problem with any movies I've bought on Amazon until now. Unless you live in another country and your devices are a different format, DON'T buy this. You'll be very disappointed.",1449100800,2,516,4.019417475728155
3868653,5,B0027UY87M,"I'll address the ""controversy"" first. I actually read the descriptions and I also own a region-free DVD player, so the product worked fine. Now about the product: The DVDs are packaged well and the disc cover is also well done. This is a really fun show and it was great to see the cartoons again. I loved this show as a kid and it is still enjoyable as an adult. I forgot how good some of the songs are that the Banana Splits play during each episode. What was a hoot was to remember certain things that annoyed me as a child. I loved Danger Island, but the girl really got on my nerves as a kid. She overacts, shakes her pigtails constantly, and whines too much. I also remember how much I loved The Three Musketeers cartoons, but absolutely hated Tooley. He's an idiot. What I did not realize as a child was that there were apparently two seasons of this show. I really hope they will release Season Two at some point because my clearest memories are of the Gulliver's Travel cartoons (I loved Glum the Lilliputian and his constant cry of ""Oh, no! We're doomed!"") and I really enjoyed the live action/animated combo of the Tom Sawyer stories. I was disappointed they were not part of this package, but I understand the reason. The late '60s/early '70s was a kind of golden age for kids' television in the US with Puf'n'stuf and the Bugaloos and New Zoo Revue, not to mention the birth of Sesame Street. I'm glad these shows are being released on DVD.",1447804800,40,1453,4.425373134328358

8355095,5,B0027UY87M,"Amazingly entertaining. First thing this is a region 2 DVD so you need a player that will read region 2. There are many players for sale on Amazon that will read all regions. I got a Phillips for $60 which allows me to view this DVD and other classics like Land of the Giants that are only available as region 2 at a reasonable price.

I watched this when I was 5 and was blown away now by the crazy antics and humor. This The Monkeys or Laugh In for kids. The live action Danger Island is pretty cool also. If you grew up with the Banana Splits you need this DVD
Lot of dates catch phrases make it fun.",1527292800,,603,4.025
