The narrative is excellently paced, and the they show you by easily followed example of the correct and incorrect actions. You clearly see everything in the lesson. Just the chapters on exercise, nutrition, and sports psychology is worth the price.",1432598400,2,308,5.0588235294117645

8683675,5,B00OHNSBKC,"I bought the 1st DVD Learn Fencing: Foil (A Beginner's Guide Sword Fighting) a little over a year ago. A great technical reference guide for beginner foil fencers.
  This new DVD Learn Fencing: Advance Foil is a great supplement to the 1st beginners foil DVD. It talks about proper warm-up, strength and conditioning exercises. It also shows some distance and footwork drills. Watching this dvd is like going to a seminar. It shows and discuss things like different ways to gain right away, long attack, short attack, close quarters, and piste position scenarios. As a beginner fencer and new to competition, this dvd has some good discussions on competition preparation, opponent analysis, tactics, and sports psychology. This foil dvd is a great tool for me to learn different methods of training. I'd learned and see things in fencing at a different perspective. As a beginner I highly recommend this DVD.",1418256000,2,908,5.046666666666667
