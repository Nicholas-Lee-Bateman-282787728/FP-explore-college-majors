8496425,3,B006CCHP7Q,I don't know what to say about this movie I mean the fact that it is in the Guinness book of world records from the most kills in a horror movie had me pretty excited to see it but the way the it's done and executed no pun intended is awful. It's CGI should have been done with a lot more practical effects. it look bad alot. take atip less is more. learn from adam green who directed hatchet,1528416000,,392,3.9746835443037973
8496426,1,B006CCHP7Q,A very disappointing project. the CGI acts a mirror to reflect how truely awful it is.  the more he uses CGI the less appeal the film has.,1477180800,,138,4.111111111111111

8496428,2,B006CCHP7Q,"No, seriously, I don't remember watching this flick. It must have been bad, but not bad enough for me to register how bad is was, which I find kind of fun - the badness I mean. Let's just call it forgettable and leave it at that.",1393372800,,229,4.0

8496430,1,B006CCHP7Q,This movie was so terrible that I watched it in disbelief. I kept waiting for it to improve and the only time it did was when the credits started. The CGI kills were child like and only served to remind me of how bad the movie was. The acting and dialogue were horrible but were better than the writing. I can't think of a single reason to watch this steaming pile of crap. Save your time and money and skip this waste of I don't know what.,1346630400,2,440,4.068965517241379
8496431,1,B006CCHP7Q,"Terrible, plotless horror film about a jogger who is nearly beaten to death and kills everyone he sees once he wakes up.  This isn't even fun for the gore because it's mostly done with computers and looks ridiculously fake.  I think the fakeness might be intentional because at times the gore is more reminiscent of cartoons from the Monty Python TV show than anything you would see in an actual slasher film, but this thing gets monotonous fast.  The Summer of Massacre is basically the equivalent of watching someone else play a video game for 90 minutes--it doesn't work as a gorefest or as a horror movie.",1329868800,4,609,4.672897196261682
8496432,5,B006CCHP7Q,"This was the best horror movie I've seen in awhile! Much better than all these big name Hollywood horror movies I've seen. None can compare to this movie. You can really tell Joe Castro and his team put a lot of work into this one. The short stories are very well crafted, with nice special effects and some very gory death scenes. There is a lot of CGI in this movie, but it suits the look of the film. I also enjoyed the music as well. If you're a fan of crazy gory horror movies, I highly recommend The Summer Of Massacre. I look forward to Joe's future projects.",1328313600,2,566,4.201834862385321

A JOE CASTRO Experience.

This film is a ride of Painful Proportions,Not because it's hard to watch ( Think of starting a Drinking Game for every death on screen ?) But,You almost feel bad for each victim,Over & Over again.

Let's breakdown the anthology segments.

RAMPAGE,Was first on dvd and can be summed up -An attack leads to another and another.

Some highlights( Wrong words?) would be the BINOCULAR shoving into skull and Blood & Guts spewing onto the camera lens (alot).

There is some very unique kills,Almost video game worthy and Let's see GRAND THEFT AUTO try the Auto-Shop scene anytime soon.

LUMP,Perhaps is alittle mean( Yeah,Even for this flick) and has the saving grace of BRINKE STEVENS getting to really act as the mother of a off-kilter familia.

SON OF THE BOOGIEMAN,A nannie ? dares some kids to go into a haunted house and is raped by the ogre within and spawns a child years later,that SHREK-like  figure has been killing to see.

BURN, Has some nice fire effects and then a PLOT about two gay firemen allowed to burn to death while embraced and the revenge the disfigured mess brings to all fire starters for decades after.

Joe Castro,Steve Escobar and Schroeder have a product from Breaking Glass Pictures that will make Amazon very happy it carried this out of season (?) gore fest.",1326240000,,1368,4.803418803418803
8496434,2,B006CCHP7Q,"Blood Pigs, Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence, The Burning Moon, Das Komabrutal Duell, Bone Sickness, VS trilogy...these are great ultra-gorefests but The Summer of Massacre is just retarded. It's fatal flaw is that 99% of the blood and gore is CGI. And CGI alone is bad enough but this is really, really bad CGI. And the filmmakers blatanly lie about the bodycount of 155. There's maybe 55 on screen kills. Already dead bodies laying around shouldn't count towards the body count and I hope Guinness revokes their world record for body count in a slasher film (if this isn't a blatant lie). I thought Joe Castro was a practical FX man? I just enjoyed his films such as Evil Unleashed, Legend of the Chupacabra and Jackhammer Massacre which if I remember correctly had almost 100% practical gore fx. Why couldn't he do that here? Is he that lazy? This film with all practical gore and blood would have been awesome. No one has ever liked CGI and it's even more hated when it comes to blood and gore. Not only were the fx horrid but the death scenes were stupid. A guy getting a remote control pushed through his mouth and splitting his head? A guy's head getting crushed with a seatbelt? Some of the stuff in the burn story was kinda neat despite still being very dodgy fx wise. Another knock on the film is the complete lack of female nudity and that wouldn't be a big deal if there wasn't any male nudity which unfortunately there was. There was even a sex scene with no nudity. The male nudity wasn't confined to the behind either...trying to tell us something Joe? This is an anthology by the way and none of the stories are worth mentioning. I dare you next time to top this film Joe, but with 100% practical blood and gore fx. Brian Paulin made 3 films just as gory as this and much, much better without any CGI at all and probably even less money than you wasted on this dissapointment.",1325894400,6,1889,4.494186046511628
