6075472,4,B00GHH9HZY,"This movie is a good love story where Garcelle Beauvais plays a young wife married to the actor Leon who was blind to things that were going on in her marriage that should have been apparent to her.  The reason why she was blind to her apparent failing marriage was because she was more focused and busy with her job and helping out a neighbor with his child to supplement her income to maintain her lifestyle and so called perfect image; but things take a twist when her husband is truthful and honest with her.  Inadvertently the things her husband said to her eventually forced her to self evaluate and reaccess her needs from her wants.

  The plot is also centered around another married couple which is played by Lynn Whitfield and Brian White where their marriage is based on betrayal, unfaithfulness, deceit, hidden secrets, and revenge along with being a marriage of convenience.  If you've ever heard of the phrase ""It's cheaper to keep her"" then this is the switch to rather ""It's cheaper to keep him"" version.  This couple live under the same roof in separate rooms yet act as if they are single, so basically they are married, living single.  Lynn Whitfield revenges and gets her husband back after she discovers his hidden secret by giving him a dose of his own medicine.

  This movie touches on issues of marriage, divorce, what happens when you try to move on too quickly to fill a void, true friendship, selfishness, the effects of holding on to hurt without releasing it, and the unexpected love that was right there alll along yet too blind to see and too hurt to open up your heart to know that you are worth to be loved in the right way.  Each cast member played their roles very well and even Lynn Whitfield graces us with her presence and great acting as well.",1393372800,24,1784,4.5579937304075235
6075473,2,B00GHH9HZY,"No one in their right mind will apologize to a man for cheating and having kids while they were married. At first,
I thought this was going to be a romantic movie. She loses the cheater and then founds the man of her dreams.
The chemistry was there and the music in this film was fantastic. However, somewhere along the way it became
a movie about a woman forgiving and apologizing to men who made her life hell. The ambiance of the movie was good, but
I didn't like the plot. We as women have to stop torching ourselves because we cant have children or don't won't them. You are
not less of a woman if you don't want kids or cant have them. Overall, I felt like I lost my money.",1392854400,8,679,4.151515151515151

6075476,4,B00GHH9HZY,"I only give this movie four stars because I haven't watched it yet. I can't wait to see it.

6075481,2,B00GHH9HZY,"In an instant her world was falling apart. The inital impact must felt like a loud blast. That would be the unexpected surprise a day care worker got after she learns her successful banker husband been living a double life. He left her of course and not long after the heroine will find herself in a familiar storyline. It is a new love with handsome handy man who is having his own martial woes. Pardon me it is at this point I split, stopped  watching the film. A little later I learned this film has an explicit sex scene admittingly not my wish to view. However the profanity I heard was already uncomfortable. Although I did not watched the whole film it feels easy to guess how this romance movie will play out towards a happy ending.
You too may not be too surprised, but maybe troubled that the leading lady becomes less innocent having illicit affair herself. Such movies may entertain a familiar but errorfull message; it is okay to fall in love with someone's spouse if you been wronged or treated unfairly yourself. It is a modern worldly motto that two wrongs make a right. Which seemingly makes this movie a wrong choice for not just children, yet anyone who wish to maintain high standards of morality .",1459296000,,1218,4.536363636363636

6075513,1,B00GHH9HZY,"At first, I thought this was going to be a decent movie. My wife and I wanted to sit down to a nice romantic movie, so we picked this one. However, as we watched it, we started noticing certain themes throughout the movie which really threw it off. By the end of the movie, we were openly laughing at how awful it was.
*** SPOILER ALERT ***
It is not much of a spoiler alert, because the whole movie is fairly predictable. It spoils itself.
The movie starts with Natalie's husband obvious upset. You then learn that he is leaving out of the blue because he has another family. Ok, strange. It is relevant to note that both are black. This will be important later. This reason for him leaving is just thrown out there. It turns out that he makes most of the money in the family and she cannot afford the house, so she has to sell it. Just to make sure, he takes all the money out of their accounts.
Ok. Her suddenly on her own and poor clumsily set up. Now we can continue to the rest of the movie.
Already, the movie is starting to annoy me. It is suggesting that a woman is incomplete without a man and cannot survive on her own. It also paints a stereotype of a black man acting badly.
Enter another black man who comes to help her get her house in order to sell. Unsurprisingly, they become attracted to each other and have sex. It is worth noting that although there is a lot of cheating and sex in this movie, none of it is shown. When the handyman's wife, who is rich so she has control of her husband, finds out. She let's Natalie know that the handyman is another bad black guy who is into hookers.
Luckily, Natalie has a white female friend who has all the answers and helps her throughout the movie. You know she is spiritual because she decides to have her baby in a wading pool in the living room. Everything is perfect for her friend.
Earlier in the movie, we also learned that Natalie babysits for the single white dad who lives next door. He makes advances on her which she eats up, of course. But she is hesitant to suddenly go out to a remote cabin with him for a holiday. She changes her mind and he tells her he'll love her forever, because, of course, he is a nice white guy.
The movie portrays women as always needing to be attached to men. While there are many blacks in the movie, they are all bad. Only the whites have virtue and fulfilled lives. I get the feeling that this plays to certain Christian stereotypes, which is why it went for PG scenes throughout the movie.
As a whole, the movie is disgusting.",1428969600,6,2532,4.244306418219462

6075526,4,B00GHH9HZY,"I join the chorus of reviewers who felt that this film was definitely not as bad as they thought it would be!  In fact, it wasn't bad at all.  I enjoyed it.

Truth moment:  I thought, based on the synopsis, that this was going to be a terrible film about men on the ""down-low"" - but even though it didn't have any LGBT themes, I found the story relatable anyway.

I was pleasantly surprised to see Greg Vaughn from Days of Our Lives in this film.  I love when soap actors cross over and do well in films.

To the greater issues that impacted me as a viewer: I was conflicted by this story because of the portrayal of the black men in the story.  Where they realistic portrayals?  Surely.  But that doesn't mean that the story itself wasn't problematic.  I don't want to spoil the story, but I can say that the film itself is not color blind, and that was so refreshing to me.  It could have delved a little deeper in the racial implications of romance, though.

The weak points to me were the choppy editing (characters were not always on the same marks in between cuts) and the ""best friend"" role that Marisol played.  I found her portrayal to be unlikable and not believable when it came to the wisdom she dispensed.

All in all, I really did like this film and recommended it to several friends.",1422662400,5,1298,4.327800829875518

6075528,5,B00GHH9HZY,"Loved the movie. Acting was by 2 of my favorites, and I just love LEON AND Garcelle, she's still beautiful.  this is a love story on many levels and it was amazing watching this movie and wondering how is this going to work out .  I was shocked, stunned, angry at some point of the men's behavior, and just felt what every woman would feel if this had happened to them.

It's a good one and spouses and BFs/GFs should look at this together.  It shows and teaches a lot of us all.  Don't want to give the movie away so I am doing this briefly.  YOU WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE, AND IT IS LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY 1:48.  Price is perfect for such a good movie. Sex is in it...I did not know that - 2 scenes - but so much other was happening until I just tried to forget that part.",1421798400,2,768,3.980392156862745

6075531,2,B00GHH9HZY,"And then the bad movie never ended...I don't think the people who rated this film 5 stars actually watched the entire thing. Perhaps they simply rated it by looking at the well known stars.

The Good-
1. Well known cast of respected black actors
2. Great score (soundtrack)
3. Good shooting locations
4. Garcelle Beauvais acted her butt off
5. The plot had real potential, dealt with issues not usually explored in black films

The Ugly/Bad
1. The film was SLOW from beginning to end
2. Several scenes were too long (first crying scene) and I desperately wanted to fast forward. My husband said it reminded him of the African films.
3. The plot was not developed and serious issues were just brushed upon. It seems they tried to pack too much drama in. Spoiler Alert-see bottom
4. this film did not need to be two hours long. Done well, it could have been done in 85-95 minutes. I want my two hours back.

Spoiler Alert- Issues brushed upon
1. Black couple buys a house they can't afford- living beyond your means
2. Keeping up appearances
3. Low self-esteem and black women and continuously choosing the wrong men
4. Older woman/ younger man
5. Unequal/dysfunctional relationships
6. Adoption/choosing not to have children/ medical conditions
7. infidelity
8. Sex addiction",1419984000,3,1274,4.808219178082192

Also, the movie should have spent more time building the relationship of the characters so that the story line could be more believable. The writing should make one feel more emotionally connected to the characters, and it didn't do that.

6075610,5,B00GHH9HZY,"I really enjoyed the movie it held my attention, forgiveness is very important in order to get peace & be set free. She did just that and now she can love again. This movie helps people that have experienced rejection and broken hearts from an ex-significant other learn to trust and love all over again..",1395532800,4,305,4.5636363636363635
6075611,3,B00GHH9HZY,The storyline was too fracture for me.  There needed to be a lot more interaction between the doctor and the main character for the ending to feel better.,1395100800,,154,4.5
6075612,5,B00GHH9HZY,"Now this movie took me by surprise. It started off nice and smooth, then got a little bumpy and then took one on a rollercoaster in minutes.  I like Leon and he played his part. I enjoyed the twists and turns but at the same time I kind of felt like I knew what I wanted to happen and I was very happy when it did. This is a good movie to watch with your girlfriends so you can talk about the behavior of men and enjoy that that women got it right in the end. Great movie.",1395100800,8,472,3.816326530612245
6075613,5,B00GHH9HZY,Natalie was so busy being angry at Joshua.....She didn't realize how selfish she was being and needed to ask for forgiveness herself. She was quite selfish and it took losing everything she had to get that revelation. Sometimes forgiveness doesn't make sense......Until you're in a position where you need to be forgiven. Now Joshua's infidelity was NOT acceptable or right......But he should have never married her knowing what she'd done. It was a pitty proposal if you ask me.,1395100800,,479,5.075949367088608
6075614,3,B00GHH9HZY,"Though we haven't seen much of Garcelld Beauvais since her days on the Jamie Foxx show, she's still quite recognizable. The story line...not so much so. It was a twist on several plots combined with a few surpises thrown in. It present unlikely scenarios to create the ""land mines"" onto which Garcelle trips. No matter how unlikely, we're presented with real hurt and drama associated with the everyday occurrences of divorce, betryal, secrecy...blah, blah, blah.",1394928000,,463,5.1866666666666665
6075615,5,B00GHH9HZY,Very good movie. Held my attention and had a good story line. Very believable and relative to what happens or could happen in a marriage.,1394409600,,137,4.52
6075616,4,B00GHH9HZY,Good movie and shows love can be right in front of our eyes and we miss it.  No matter the pain we can still love again.,1394236800,,120,3.6153846153846154
6075617,3,B00GHH9HZY,"Natalie (Garcelle Beauvais) made a choice. She didn't think about how it would affect others. She didn't think about how it would affect her. She didn't think about how it would change her relationships, her life. She's been hiding behind emotional walls for years. Will she ever allow the walls to come down and give true love a chance?

As I watched I thought I knew what was going on with some of the characters, but I was wrong. Characters and situations were not as they appeared and that was what made this movie interesting. There were surprises - one, in particular, that I would rather not  have seen. What it showed, though, was that we can't assume just by looking at people that they aren't keeping a dirty secret. Appearances can be deceiving.

There is an explicit sex scene - the only part I did not like. It took the movie to a gritty place, and even though it was brief, it was too much for me. There is also a bit of profanity. I had no problem with that.

This film gives the viewer a lot to think about. For the most part, I liked it.

Amazon Instant Video: The image and sound quality were very good.",1394064000,18,1121,4.344497607655502

6075619,5,B00GHH9HZY,Wonderful story that teaches us not judge but understand the purpose of those that come in our lives. Sometime love is right next door.,1393977600,,135,4.666666666666667
6075620,3,B00GHH9HZY,"I love Brian White so that is the real reason I wanted to see this film. Some people have issues and don't care for the straight to dvd movies. I personally love any movie that has a good story and decent acting. As usual Leon is playing the bad guy. I don't know why he continues to let himself be type cast into these roles but I guess when you want to work and its the only thing being offered then you will take it.
As far as this story, it was quite surprising to me. At first I thought it was going to be one of those typical man leaves woman and woman is bitter and hates all men. Lol but this one was different. I think the character realized her flaws and what she really needed in her life and went out and got it.",1393891200,,724,3.931972789115646
6075621,5,B00GHH9HZY,I loved this film. Forgiveness is not for the person you forgive but it is for yourself. forgiveness is for the brave and forgiveness is of God. Please watch this film.,1393459200,,168,4.451612903225806
