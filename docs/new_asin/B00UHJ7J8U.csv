7040670,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"Great documentary done with love by Tommy Tedesco's son.  It was thoroughly enjoyable and a nice tribute to some great studio musicians that shaped the 50's, 60's + music era.",1426291200,,175,4.833333333333333
7040671,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"This doc is a joyous celebration of your favorite artists from the 1960s, and you will see footage of bands that you have never seen before. It is fascinating to see all of the legendary L.A. clubs and recording studios where these artists conceived the magic. We need more ""instant videos"" such as this one. I read about it in the L.A. Times in the morning, and I viewed it online later in the day.",1426204800,,399,4.333333333333333

7040673,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"If you listened to the radio in the 1960s, or if you've ever listened to hit records that were made in the 1960s, you will want to see this movie. It tells the story of the musicians who were behind a huge number of those recordings, and they aren't the ones who were on the album covers. The session players themselves tell some great stories, and a wonderful bonus is seeing and hearing stars like Brian Wilson, Leon Russell, Gary Lewis, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork, Herb Alpert, and Cher discuss the contributions these musicians made to their records. The only way this movie could have been better is if it were twice as long.",1426204800,64,629,4.526315789473684

You'll learn a lot about the music business and how it has changes since the 1960s. Now that PBS has picked it up as a fundraiser, it will become more widely viewed and become a valuable rock n roll keepsake.",1528070400,,346,4.421875

7040679,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"I first saw this movie at a screening in L.A., with Denny Tedesco, Hal Blaine and other members of the Wrecking Crew there to talk about it. While I haven't yet watched the DVD, which I believe may contain even more material since that screening, I can say that it is a most remarkable, eye-opening movie! (Ears, too!) In it you see the creation and stories behind MANY of the biggest, most iconic hits of the '60s in particular, and the L.A. session musicians known as the Wrecking Crew, who provided the music bed behind some of the biggest names in music. If you're a musician, or just an aficionado, this is worth having in your collection for the music alone, not to mention the real ""behind the scenes"" look at its creation. From the Pink Panther to the Monkees, Sonny & Cher to the Beach Boys, and dozens of others, this is an incredible story to witness.",1525046400,,862,4.462025316455696

7040687,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"An outstanding documentary that answers the question ""who were we really listening to in the 60's ?"".  Told in a compelling and interesting way by way of interviews with the session musicians, producers and band members who where replaced on the album by these session musicians.  The documentary contains great clips from the 60's, 70's and lots of interviews with the Wrecking Crew.  Apparently the only people who knew what was really going on were music producers, music execs and the musicians that were replaced by these exceptionally talented session musicians.  The talent of these session musicians is stunning and their story is told in this excellent documentary.  There needs to be a part two because I sense that there is so much more that could be told about these professionals.  A MUST SEE !!!!!",1518825600,,811,4.970370370370371

One example: Hal Blaine. If you don't know him or don't know enough about him, first check out his accomplishments on Wikipedia. WHAT???? He played on EVERYTHING!!!

7040707,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"This is a fascinating documentary for those of us who grew up with 1960s music. It chronicles the career of The Wrecking Crew, a group of top-notch Los Angeles session musicians who played on dozens of hit records in that decade, including The Beach Boys, The Ronettes, The Crystals, The Righteous Brothers, other Phil Spector productions, The 5th Dimension, the early Monkees records, Michael Nesmith's 1968 vanity project&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wichita-Train-Whistle-Sings/dp/B01KBI8P3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wichita Train Whistle Sings</a>, Elvis movie soundtracks, Herb Alpert And The Tijuana Brass, Frank Sinatra, Nat ""King"" Cole, Nancy Sinatra, Henry Mancini, Sonny And Cher, Steely Dan, Simon And Garfunkel, and dozens more. While The Beatles never played with The Wrecking Crew, because they never recorded in a U.S. studio, drummer Hal Blaine does play background percussion on the Vee-Jay Records 1964 interview album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hear-The-Beatles-Tell-All/dp/B000GEE7ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hear The Beatles Tell All</a>. George Harrison also recorded parts of Jackie Lomax's Apple Records album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Is-This-What-You-Want/dp/B003YDXGEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Is This What You Want?</a>&nbsp;in L.A. with members of The Crew. George also used various members of The Crew on many of his solo albums, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Concert-For-Bangladesh/dp/B000BF0D88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Concert For Bangladesh</a>.

I do not know if Paul or Ringo ever used The Crew on any of their solo albums.

Among the players, in addition to Blaine, were drummer Earl Palmer, saxists Plas Johnson and Steve Douglas, bassists Carol Kaye and Joe Osborn, keyboardists Don Randi and Larry Knechtel, and the late guitarist Tommy Tedesco, whose son narrated and co-produced this film. While the music appears only in sound bites, the interviews and stories are wonderful. This Blu-ray disc also has a mammoth six hours of additional bonus material (which I haven't even watched yet) covering additional stories behind the songs, TV and movie themes, musician jokes, and much more.

No, it's not just a Beach Boys documentary, though Brian Wilson does play a prominent role. It is a magnificent, entertaining film, which music fans will love. Five stars.",1508371200,5,2758,7.06140350877193

7040711,4,B00UHJ7J8U,"If you love the rock and pop music from the 60's and early 70's, this documentary will open your eyes as well as your ears.  It contains 2 discs.  On disc 1, the first 40 minutes contains previews (advertisements), for other DVDs.  I fast-forwarded through this part.  About 90% of what you are going to see are close-up interviews with the various musicians.  Sometimes you will see only one musician at a time.  Other times, 2 or 3 musicians will be seen together, ""talking about the old days"".  Also, you will see many, many old photos of the recording sessions as well as the legendary singers. If you've ever been curious about ""who played what"" on many of those hit songs that you love from the 60's and early 70's, your curiosity will be satisfied.  Did you know that the members of the Turtles did not play on their records?  The same goes for Gary Lewis and the Playboys, The Grassroots, etc., etc.  And here's one that really surprised me: On almost ALL of the Beach Boys records, the Beach Boys did not play the instruments. Does that blow your mind?  It was the Wrecking Crew!
My only complaint is that there are gaps between the many interviews as they switch from one musician to another.  Your TV screen will go dark for 8, 10, 15 seconds. This may not bother everyone.  But, it bothered me.  I don't like staring at blank screens.  Am I glad I bought this DVD?  Yes, I am.",1506297600,,1388,4.426877470355731

They were studio musicians in California, who were the back-up band, for so many, it's unreal.  They ""all"" were so wonderfully talented, and really made excellent music, which definitely helped sell the albums, as well as help receive awards for the songs and records for the artists they backed.
The musicians included artists as ""Glen Campbell"", and ""Leon Russell"", and so many, many more talented individual artists themselves.  This
is not only informative, but an excellent DVD, that will entertain you, and surprise you, of what they all accomplished.  This is a definite keeper in my music DVD library.  Enjoy, as I have. :-)",1503273600,2,770,5.039370078740157

7040742,2,B00UHJ7J8U,"For all the hoopla and buzz prior to the release of this video, I was not all that impressed once I watched it.  The topics meandered too much--the production and editing would have benefited from a lot more focus to stay on specific subjects, especially if they had stuck to a specific timeline, or spent one segment each on the individuals, rather than dart around topics and subjects like a squirrel crossing the road.  This, overall, is sloppy.

Much of the discussion also reminded me more of ego-stroking and mutual back-patting than the dispensing of facts, history and trivia that I wanted to see in this documentary.  There are also a few flawed memories here and there, which don't add up with what has been said elsewhere (no, not Wikipedia).  The guest appearances by others in the music industry, to me, were more entertaining.  I've seen better, tighter video documentaries than this one.  I can't say I will ever watch it again.",1497139200,,943,4.783950617283951

Director Denny Tedesco is the son of the late Tommy Tedesco, perhaps the most recorded guitarist in history thanks to the 3-a-day session schedule he and other L.A. studio musicians kept during the '60s, playing on everything from ""Good Vibrations"" to ""Eve of Destruction."" With his father being an essential part of the story line, the ""maudlin"" alarm could easily go off, but director Tedesco talks about his dad (and himself, sparingly but necessarily) without descending into sentimentality. More important, he traces the careers of rock's TRUE hitmakers via interviews with the session musicians themselves as well as artists they backed, from Brian Wilson to Cher, Glen Campbell, Gary Lewis, Herb Alpert, Barry McGuire, the Mamas & Papas and many others.

The others to watch are 20 Feet from Stardom (2013 ) and  Standing in the Shadows of Motown (2002 - the Funk Brothers).

This movie should NOT have Brian Wilson's name as if he were the filmmaker. He is not. He does not deserve this misplaced credit - it belongs to Denny Tedesco and his unsung heros.

I thank Denny and his team that put this together and did a wonderful job. Way back, I knew much of the Monkees story - that they were a put together band who used studio musicians for their recordings. Few I were aware of what was going on musically on the west coast during this time. OI'm glad I didn't know who was making the records back then but now I can clearly see why it was done this way - to save valuable studio time and get the best results. Those musicians capabilities were way above simple rock music, so they did an incredible job, even if they often had to dumb down their art. I now have a new appreciation of why these recordings sound so great. I wish I was around them with the talent to be part of this scene.

Although legendary guitarist Tommy Tedesco is featured, it also acknowledges the contributions of others in ""the Crew"" and adroitly articulates the spirit of a musical era in which Los Angeles reigned supreme as the hit-making epicenter.  From Sinatra, 5th Dimension, Elvis, to the Beach Boys and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, from rock, soul, jazz, to musical film\tv scores the virtuosity of the Wrecking Crew was unprecedented.

Well, prepare to have your world turned upside down again. This movie puts the faces to some of the music that you grew up with. Not who you thought played the music but the actual musicians.
Apparently Los Angeles has some incredible gravitational pull that attracts all the musical child prodigies that you hear of but then they disappear.  Turns out they were doing studio work at a time when music was best recorded by a live ensemble in a studio. This time has passed with the advances in recording technology but these guys did exceptional work and it has stood the test of time.
Very interesting from a historical standpoint as it shows the industry as it was then and the people that made it so. Its one of the few movies that I put the ""extras"" on immediately to keep the vibe going.
I know that there were many people on the ""1st Call List"" out there and a lot of them did not make the cut in the movie but those that did were memorable. Carol Kaye, Tommy Tedesco, Glen Campbell, Hal Blaine, Joe Osborn, Earl Palmer, Plas Johnson (and others) all come across as musical geniuses that take to music like most of us breathe, easy and automatic.

So glad Tommy Tedesco's son had the vision to get this on tape while his dad was still alive and connected to some of his contemporaries.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing shabby about this video or its content.  But it left me hungering for more from the ""stars"" themselves.

Instead they get to avoid life on the road as well as having a bit more job security. Even so it is sad that some of them said that they always said yes to every job for fear of being replaced.

7040839,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"This is a wonderful documentary, the only one of its kind that I know of, and a well produced labor of love by the son of the legendary jazz guitarist Tommy Tedesco. I literally found myself unable to remove it from my DVD player for weeks, and enjoyed it over and over again, especially as a musician growing up in Los Angeles in the 60s, the music was the background of my childhood, and to see what was going on behind the scenes was a fantastic trip down memory lane. Hearing the Real Don Steele over the airwaves on KHJ-AM, seeing Herb Alpert and Lou Adler sitting together (they co-produced Jan & Dean's Baby Talk for the Dore label), Gary Lewis & The Playboys (with vintage clips of Tommy Tedesco behind it), watching Carol Kaye demonstrate the bass line on Good Vibrations, and I could go on and on. This was a well presented documentary to highlight the contributions of the Los Angeles studio scene musicians who never received their due credit. As Dick Clark mentions, we listened to the songs by The Association, the 5th Dimension, Herb Albert & The TJB, and their wonderful arrangements and instrumentations and enjoyed them and bought the records, but growing up we really didn't care who was behind it all in the studio when we went out and bought the 45s. My only regret was that more mention or interviews were not offered by the horn players, i.e. Shorty Rogers, Roy Caton, Dick Nash, Jay Migliori, Tony Terran, Chuck Findley, Ollie Mitchell, etc etc. Nevertheless, a marvelous and well done film on all counts. It is refreshing the interest regarding the stellar group of musicians has gotten over the past several years, and the many comments on Youtube over the songs!

Motown had the Funk Brothers (watch Standing in the Shadows of Motown), and Alabama had The Swampers (watch Muscle Shoals)... the West coast had The Wrecking Crew.  The Wrecking Crew could read and write sheet music though, so they were a bit more savvy/versatile.  Regardless of which group you like... this is a great vid to watch.. especially the inside stories on working with Beach Boys Brian Wilson...  FASCINATING...

The wrecking crew, was a relatively small group of studio musicians who supplied instrumental backgrounds for an amazing variety of singers and groups. Their work extended from the late 1950's to the early 70's. I was slightly disappointed to learn of songs not recorded as I had imagined the bands playing them, but happy to learn how such great music was produced.

Brian Wilson's unique sound and score can be attributed to the work by The Wrecking Crew. Brian has the good sense to record with sessions musicians. These talented men and women (classically trained, most jazz musicians) could walk into a recording studio, sight read, and play any genre...jazz, folk, rock, Latin, you name it.

7040868,4,B00UHJ7J8U,"This documentary by Denny Tedesco was a labor of love based on the life of his father, Tommy and other musicians who provided the instrumental backing for hundreds, if not thousands of records released from the 1950s to the 1980s.  Funded independently including Crowd Funding, the film was finished in 2008 but didn't see the light of day until 2015 and then only briefly.

The movie features numerous interview clips with the famous headliners who got the credit but more so with the dozen or so musicians who actually played the music.  Tedesco gathered his dad and his friends in a sort of round table discussion which is a starting point for numerous stories.  Tedesco has acquired numerous clips (both film and stills) of the musicians interacting with the stars.  While I was certainly aware that studio sessions were rarely just the 3 or 4 bandmates who might tour, I didn't understand the depth of their involvement.

In the recent movie about Brian Wilson of ""The Beach Boys"" called Love & Mercy we see that Brian, early on, didn't want to tour.  He wanted to lock himself in a room with real musicians and create music.  Known in the business as The Wrecking Crew, these are the people who actually played and help create that music.  They played for everyone from Sinatra to The Byrds to The Monkeys to The Mamas and the Papas and dozens of others.

Many of those interviewed back in 07 and 08 are gone and some of the interviews obviously took place well before that, which gives the doc a bit of a dated feel.  Perhaps the most famous of the group is Glen Campbell who went on to be famous and then called his old mates to help play his music.  This is a wonderful film, reminiscent of a similar story (Standing in the Shadows of Motown) featuring The Funk Brothers.  See them both.",1465430400,,1796,4.575

7040957,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"Such a great film about a little known fact to most fans of pop music. A great tribute to those who created the sound we all associate with each group as if they were all different entities. Who knew they were the same folks pretending to be different bands based on who was recording that day?

This disc is a terrific documentary and it's well put together to allow you to explore extra content at your leisure. If you enjoy pop music and want to know more about the people who actually entertained you for all these years, it's your duty to at least watch this film of not own it. Also pick up the Muscle Shoals movie and the 20 Feet from Stardom documentary which covers backing singers and how some, like Darlene Love, rose to fame singing not only under her own name, but for other girl groups as well. But it's more than just Darlene Love, she was just my example. It also covers how some people make a great living and enjoy just being the backing sound for lead singers. It's a unique take on showing the full picture of those that can rise, rise, and those that don't want to, still enjoy themselves, and of course there are a few that never got their just due credit. But these three documentaries will give you the complete picture of most of the pop music made during the 1960s and into the 70s and even later. There is another doc that covers the Motown Sound and how they were the Wrecking Crew for that genre, but I think they were the Funk Brothers and it was a much smaller group.

The Wrecking Crew, though, does what it should do, it honors those who should have been honored years ago. Since watching this, I have seen other documentaries of artists I enjoy, like, Ringo Starr and others that speak highly of Hal Blaine's drumming among others included in this documentary. These folks were talented like you can't believe! Played any genre and as we know from the music they created, they even helped form new genres by incorporating other influences all the time.",1454025600,,1986,4.438356164383562

7040967,4,B00UHJ7J8U,"This is an important film about an uncredited group of studio musicians (aka The Wrecking Crew) who played on countless hit records that were recorded in L.A. from the 1950's-early 80's. These same musicians played on most hit records, TV shows, film soundtracks, etc. behind most artists who recorded in L.A. While other music cities had session groups who recorded mainly at one studio (Motown, FAME, American, etc.), the Wrecking Crew recorded at all major studios in L.A., Hollywood, etc. FYI, Drummer Hal Blaine may be the most recorded MUSICIAN of all time, and he's often credited with coming up with the ""wrecking crew"" name.

The film is lovingly made by Denny Tedesco as a tribute to his late father, Wrecking Crew guitarist Tommy Tedesco (who may be the most recorded guitarist of all time). Denny has been working on this film for a LONG time. One key obstacle was raising the money to pay for the music licensing, as this soundtrack probably has more songs than any other film ever made. He aims to make sure that the musicians get paid their royalties from the film.

Watching the film, you meet the key band members and producers were behind a lot of hit records. It is a lot of interview footage and could use more footage of the musicians playing (like the documentary ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" has). I also wish the musicians talked a bit about the gear, how they got their sounds in the studio, etc.

The film runs for about and hour and 40 minutes and there are a LOT of extra bonus interview clips (maybe 2 hours worth, I haven't watched them all yet) as well. The film is very interesting and holds your attention throughout. Another cool bonus feature is a musicians credit, listing all the musicians who played on each song in the film. This had to be researched by looking at union contracts to see who was hired for each session. I've never seen that before.

I really looked forward to getting a copy of this film and am glad to finally have it. I have this film on both Blu-ray and on DVD and here are a couple of comments to add:

- Firstly, I HATE navigating through the Blu-ray menu to get to specific bonus features, as it's hard to tell where the cursor is at and if you press the wrong choice you end up reloading the disc again and going through the previews. There is no issue with the DVD menu, it works without hassle.

- Secondly, the Blu-ray has higher quality picture and sound than DVD. Even though most of the old footage does not look ""high definition"", it still is better on the Blu-ray.

- Thirdly, I find the volume to be very inconsistent during the bonus interviews. It's sometimes too loud and sometimes too quiet and I have to keep working the volume on my remote.

I like the film and think it's worth viewing and owning for any music lover, especially fans of 1950s-70s pop music. If you like this film, make sure to check out other similar films about session musicians at Muscle Shoals, Motown, Stax, etc. as well as ""20 Feet From Stardom"", a film about backing singers.

7040986,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"A long overdue tribute to the unsung 'day laborers' who made so much of the popular culture that was a large part of the lives of multiple generations. The Wrecking Crew stands proudly alongside Muscle Shoals, 50 feet from stardom, Standing in the shadows of Motown, and other recent documentaries that finally tell the backstory of much of late 20th century pop culture.
  I will admit, I'm a nerd who finds the backstory often more interesting than the actual public story. I was far more intrigued by the documentaries about Citizen Kane than I was by the film itself. Same for the wrecking crew. The songs and TV/Movie soundtracks these folks are as much a part of my life as anyones. Yet hearing the musicians, producers, and songwriters sharing their own reminiscences and anecdotes is far more satisfying than hearing the finished product. In fact, hearing the stories makes listening to far too familiar music much more interesting and satisfying.
  This film is both a loving tribute from an appreciative son to his dad, and a cultural artifact far beyond the scope of any one musician's personal story. As soon as I saw it in a limited engagement in a small art cinema. I knew I had to own the disc.
  It holds up to repeated viewings and the extras on the disc are ridiculously numerous and fascinating. This disc is practically a graduate level course on American pop music of the mid 20th century.

Anyway, Knowing that this group of people were really the one's responsible for many of the great chart hits that I loved so much it put things in perspective and gave credit where credit was due (these folks were rarely if ever,  mentioned on album Jackets, liners, etc).

One talks about his ex-wives and losing his millions of dollars -- it's kind of off-subject. Overall, though, the doc is about the music and how it was made and by whom.

The producers and/or director spent most of their time with the lesser known members of The Crew, instead of doing the more obvious thing and focusing on the more famous celebrity crew members like Glenn Campbell, Leon Russell, etc. Maybe these guys didn't want the spotlight (Campbell has his own doc), or maybe the producers/director deliberately chose to highlight the lesser known members and give them their due. Either way, these guys (and one gal) deserve the recognition.

You'll recognize quite a few names here, and quite a few songs, if, like me, you cut your teeth on rock music of the 60s and 70s.",1446768000,,936,4.701219512195122

The songs and the music were powerful, yet little did we know the real power BEHIND all of this.  That power was an incredible group of men and women known as the wrecking crew.  It's a wonderful tour of the music that became legend (and is still played today), but the people that made the music (the guitarists, bass players, drummers, and so on) were the real force that made the music memorable!  There are so many stories that need to be told that I hope the makers of the film The Wrecking Crew will one day make a sequel because they've only scratched the surface!  This is without a doubt a masterpiece of love and dedication to those men and women who made us remember those unforgettable tunes of an era long gone (but the music lives on)!

7041058,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"Everybody, everybody from the generation of 68 who came of musical age in the 1950s with the fresh breeze of rock and roll and its iconic figures like Elvis, Jerry Lee, Chuck, Bo, Buddy, Wanda, Carl, Bill and later in the classic age the Beach Boys, Association, Sonny and Cher, and a ton of girl groups like the Ronettes, the Shirelles and Martha and the Vandella to not even come close to exhausting the list knows that those guys got us jumping, got girls going crazy throwing  every kind of object their way, including some unmentionables, and guys, guys like me, went crazy trying to look like Elvis with longer sideburns, swiveling hips (mind are still not right to this day trying to make that move he had that sent the girls into spasms), and snarl that every girl knew she could wipe off his face if she just had a minute with him, like Bill with his curlicue curl of hair and knowing smile, like Buddy hairs too, tried to emulate Chucks duck walk and get nothing but a sore back for the efforts just so those girls who were throwing themselves with abandon to those faraway heroes would throw something our way.

Thats the easy part, the upfront part of the saga of music of the baby-boomer now AARP-worthy crowd. What we have with the documentary under review, Dennis Tedescos The Wreaking Crew, dedicated to his late father who was one of the members is the back story of how rock and roll records, 45 RPM at first then albums, a lot of them got the great sounds that came out of that work. Now there are disputes, internal to the group and otherwise as we find out in the film, about the real name tagged onto the group of seasoned session and studio musicians who made the difference in the sound of rock and roll, especially that rock and roll sound after the likes of Sun Records were eclipsed by the bigger companies out on the West Coast. What is not in dispute is that this relatively small cohort of men and one woman (Carol Kaye) played in back of some of the greatest hits of the era. Made a difference in the sound with their expertise and ability to play and improvise everything before them from pop classics to commercials (hey they had to make a living too besides create great rock sounds since they were in back not the front).

This documentary, as with all such efforts, is consciously designed to feature the talking heads of whoever in the early 2000s was still around to tell the tale of how West Coast musicians came to the rescue of many a record producer who were looking for help. It is also a story about how each featured musician came to the group and in some cases what happened after the music died. Well, not so much that the music died but that later on guys like Bob Dylan and groups like the Stones and Beatles were their own singer-songwriters and had enough professional competence to do the studio sessions themselves. Or thought they did.  For a look at a piece of rock history, real rock history since most of the crew  were individually or collectively induced into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame check this one out.",1443139200,,3069,4.4537366548042705

The second disc, considerably longer than the movie itself, has its ups and downs, but the ups make it well worthwhile.

7041113,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"Although I am a jazz musician in the early 60s I was playing rock like the rest of my peers. Growing up I listened to a lot of hit records and back then did not have a clue who was backing the star. Years later I came to know that two influential drummers - Hal Blaine and Earl Palmer - among others were on nearly every hit record of US music that influenced me. I was also oblivious to the other members of the Wrecking Crew, but this documentary sets the record straight.

Actually, this is a cross between a documentary, a biopic and a tribute by producer and director Denny Tedesco to his father Tommy who was one of the founding members of the Wrecking Crew.

Many of the musicians who were in the Crew, as well as other musicians and folks involved in the industry contribute as though this is an oral history (which it is). More importantly, while many of the folks who make an appearance and add to the stories are now deceased, Tedesco has captured their thoughts and opinions on film while they were still alive. From an historical perspective that adds to this film's value.

The focus, though is on the members of the Crew and how their lives unfolded because of both their talent and being in the right place at the right time. Of course, the fact that they are now getting recognition for their contributions to the birth and development of rock is another reason to watch this film.

While this is probably more meaningful to folks of my generation (I was born in 1948), anyone who is inspired by music, regardless of age, will find something of interest. In fact, this film will give young rock musicians a clear idea of the shoulders upon which they now stand.

Know that the Wrecking Crew was but one facet of rock history. There are a few other films that fill in the picture of American rock music (and soul, which was also intertwined during the era in which I grew up).

7041129,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"This is such a great DVD, I watched it and I was so fascinated with all of their stories. The era, the love of what they did. Every one of the musicians, engineers, writers said basically the same thing...for 50 or so years they felt like they got paid for doing what they loved, that for 50 yrs. they didn't work a day in their lives...it was in their hearts. The camaraderie they had with each other was beautiful and it came through with each interview. We don't have this in music today where everything is produced by email or by computer...this was a group of men and women jamming together, playing off one another it just makes me sad that we have lost this today.  I too am a baby boomer and this is why when I hear these songs I feel the way I feel, I guess I feel the love. The deleted scenes are so great it's like watching another film entirely. What you get from this DVD is worth far more than you pay. Get this and experience this DVD, you will learn so much, laugh,
 cry and fall in love with this beautiful tribute by Denny Tedesco.

7041133,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"If you are a musician, if you are a music lover, this wonderful, inspiring, insightful and enjoyable documentary is for you. Every country, every city and every era has its star ""session musicians"", the usually unsung heroes who play on other people's recordings. Every now and then some break out to become famous such as Jimmy Page into Led Zeppelin and all the members of Toto. The Wrecking Crew traces a large group of these musicians in LA in the 1960s who worked with artists ranging from Frank Sinatra (and Nancy!), Elvis, The Beach Boys, and so many, many more. Even more significant than the artists they worked with are the songs they played on. When I started watching this, my wife politely decided to do some work but kept an ear out on the movie. Sure enough, after hearing so many songs that are still famous, she dropped her work and became engrossed. As a musician, you will appreciate the artistry at work not just in the playing and the interpretation but also the psychology required to get on with everyone else in the studio including the artists, the songwriters and the arrangers.

Clearly this film was a labour of love, made by the son of renowned guitarist Tommy Tedesco who, realizing his father was dying several years ago, decided to document his father and his colleagues. It has taken years and endless wrangling with record companies just to release audio clips so we can hear what these guys were playing. The stories and the whole end result are worth it!

7041144,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"While the Beatles have sold more music than anyone, I can see the argument for adding an asterisk to that record book entry after seeing the 2008 documentary THE WRECKING CREW.  The recording industry nickname for 30-odd individuals who, in various configurations, were the studio musicians likeliest to be called for Los Angeles session work in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, the Wrecking Crew was the group you often heard when you thought you were listening to the Beach Boys, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, the Association, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, the Monkees, the Grass Roots, and countless other bands.

Look up the WIKIPEDIA piece on them for the names of the musicians who comprised the Wrecking Crew and a sample listing of hit records to which they contributed.  I count no fewer than 40 hit singles in the same period of the Beatles' recording career, where the Fab Four had around 30 hit singles.  But note the Wikipedia entry of Wrecking Crew hits is but a partial list. Okay, the Beatles were just four guys; the Wrecking Crew was 30-odd musicians.  Still, you get my point.

7041163,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"If you ever thought that documentaries were boring, The Wrecking Crew should go a long way toward changing your mind.  The term The Wrecking Crew refers to a group of studio musicians who played on more hit records throughout the sixties than you could ever imagine.  They were professional musicians who, at their height, would play twelve hours a day three hundred days a year and measured their success by how many jobs they had to turn down because they were so busy.  We all know that the Monkees were not professional musicians, but there were so many other acts in the sixties, often the Phil Spector sound, where the studio albums were put out by these consummate professionals from Sonny and Cher to the Association to the Ronnettes.  If you enjoyed the Brian Wilson movie Love and Mercy, particularly the parts where Brian works with a group of studio musicians to get the unique sounds he heard in his head that then became Pet Sounds, you will love this documentary.

There is no question that we have all grown up with these songs and your feet will tap uncontrollably while watching this documentary.  Interspersed with the sights and sounds of the bands are more modern day video interviews of the musicians who were involved in the sound of the mid-sixties and often became quite wealthy for a short period before it became the thing for bands to play their own music and their world came crashing down.

For the layman or casual music lover, it might be a little too inside baseball to appreciate in its entirety, but believe me when I say that if you know the music and artists of this period (60s) itll be a hoot.  The stories of how the LA music industry machine worked, and personal stories of how creative musicians worked (and still do) are very entertaining, inspiring, and at times laugh out loud funny.  Unless youve been fortunate enough to join in on a whole lot of  afterhours music business bull sessions, you won't get this kind of stuff anywhere else.",1437350400,,633,4.469565217391304

It's fun to think about how these largely unidentified players professionally provided the music behind a vast number of the tunes everyone hummed in their youth.  This movie is by the son of Tommy Tedesco, a great study guitarist.  It features a bit more of Tedesco than others but if pretty even handed about the importance of all the fine studio musicians.  Brian Wilson is one artist who used them but I'm not sure why Amazon lists him as it was his movie or story.  I'd rented this is low resolution for $3.99.

7041249,4,B00UHJ7J8U,"I thought the dvd was well produced, with the extensive interviews with all of the players. It would have been nice if there were more archival photos. You could have picked a particular artist snapshot, then run the audio over top. The interviews you have were highly edited, based on the numerous stops and starts. There were 2 small editing flaws on the 1st disc, where interviews were being conducted and the camera cuts away to nothing. They are brief, however. I realize this is the ""virgin version"" of the movie. Maybe if there is more material not on the two discs, perhaps a Side 2 or Version 2 of the Wrecking Crew could be put together. It is a great effort on the part of Denny Tedesco, directing. I was constantly flooded with memories of old 45s when I heard some of the music. Bringing back the teenage years with a documentary like this was truly refreshing and educational. Finding out who was behind all those old tv program themes was a gas. Cool, man.

The Wrecking Crew go from simple songs by the Monkees... to sophisticated arrangements of Brian Wilson's Pet Sounds... to working with SInatra... doing TV themes for Green Acres and the Twilight Zone... and sounding different on each one of these. Gary Lewis and the Playboys, Mamas and the Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, Beach Boys, Grass Roots, Sonny and Cher, Jan and Dean, all of Phil Spector's work with the Righteous Brothers, Darlene Love and the Ronettes... the list is too long. You thought all of these aforementioned groups played their own instruments... well, think again. It was the Wrecking Crew. Get this DVD and be amazed. There will never be a single group of musicians assembled again with this much talent and imagination. The music of today can't hold a candle to what these guys did in the 60's. Unbelievable. Drummer,Hal Blaine's story alone (the most recorded musician of our time) is mind-blowing. Carole KAye, amazing bassist, Leon Russell, piano, Steve Douglas, sax... all unreal.

These folks were world-class musicians who, it turns out, played on seven consecutive songs of the year. They're a fun bunch who were instrumental in coming up with some of the licks that became the hook of a monster hit. I was also impressed by how they talked about Glen Campbell as just one of the players. When he was one of the Wrecking Crew he was just a great guitarist who hadn't even started his singing career yet. The Wrecking Crew was to the West Coast sound what the Funk Brothers were to Motown.

When the DVD finally arrived it included promos for the book and a bumper sticker so I could promote the film. Classy. It would've all been forgotten if the film had lived up to the hype. It did not. The interminable number trailers for other Magnolia films brought back happy memories of other films that were more enjoyable.

7041324,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"One of the greatest things that has happened with the rise of documentary feature films as well as their release to DVD is getting credit to people who deserved it but never got it. The movie IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN let us know that a group of musicians who came to be known as the Funk Brothers performed all the music behind the biggest hits from Motown. MUSCLE SHOALS let us know about the history of those who performed at that now famous recording studio. Now we have another movie to add to that collection of films about music from our past. THE WRECKING CREW tells the story of the studio musicians who played on nearly everything to come out of California from the late 50s through the early 80s.

You say you never heard of The Wrecking Crew? They may not have been an actual band but this group of 15-30 musicians have filled your ears whether you know it or not. Let me prove it. Have you heard any of the following songs? California Dreaming, Be My Baby, California Girls, Youve Lost That Lovin Feelin, Viva Las Vegas, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Mr. Tambourine Man, Windy, Wichita Lineman, These Boots Were Made For Walking, Surfers Stomp, Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves, Love Will Keep Us Together, Strangers in the Night, Up, Up and Away, A Taste of Honey or The Beat Goes On. How about the theme songs to TV series like Batman, Green Acres, Hawaii Five O or MASH? If youve heard one of these songs then youve heard The Wrecking Crew.

THE WRECKING CREW is a documentary made by Denny Tedesco, the son of Tommy Tedesco one of the driving forces behind the studio musicians known as the Wrecking Crew. The musicians got the moniker when they arrived on the scene in California. Wearing jeans and T-shirts as they entered the studio the old guard musicians said that they would wreck the music business, thus the name. The prophecy didn't stick because most continued playing for the next 40-50 years.

Going back to the beginning Tedesco (Denny) looks at the early arrival of these musicians and how they worked in the business. Each was a skilled musician eager to work and able to read music at a glance. Where bands would form and try to learn the music being written for them by the producers who gathered them together, the Wrecking Crew could pump out hit after hit in no time flat. A great example in the movie is when Roger McGuin of the Byrds talks about how it took 3 hours to record Mr. Tambourine Man with the crew while it took 70 to record Turn, Turn, Turn with the actual band. The crew new how to record in the studio and that was what made them so valuable to producers and record companies.

On the plus side this meant that they were constantly in need, especially during the early sixties as rock and roll began to take over the airwaves. On the down side it meant that they rarely if ever received credit for the work that they did. Their names didn't appear on the credits of nearly every album they ever played on. All of that has begun to change as historians and fans try to remedy that situation. Inductions into the rock and roll hall of fame have come as well as tons of recognition stemming from the release of this film.

Interviews with a number of those who were a part of this now famous group fill most of the movie along with pictures taken back when they were the biggest thing around even if it was behind the scenes. Sadly a number have passed since the making of the film. Its great to know though that their legacy and memories have been captured for us to enjoy for years to come.

The entire time I was watching this film all I could do was marvel at all of them. I was stunned at their abilities, I was shocked that they never got the credit they deserved and I was filled with an abundance of joy while listening to some of the music that I grew up with and enjoyed time and time again, year after year. Thats the true lasting legacy of The Wrecking Crew, that the work that they did, the music that they created, will be here for centuries to come. Its a lasting tribute that shows they were worth much more than the late recognition they finally received.

I cant recommend this movie strongly enough, especially if you grew up in the 60s and 70s or if you love music. Ive watched it twice already. And while there are probably more marketable and popular movies being released this week this is the one I would tell you to go out and buy, to watch over and over again.

7041331,3,B00UHJ7J8U,"Enjoyable, if not completely factual. Glad these great players are finally getting their due, but some fact finding and someone who actually looked at the AFM sheets would've gone a long way towards giving this film more credibility.  I'm going to specifically comment on The Wrecking Crew's contributions to the Beach Boys and The Byrds, both of which have been grossly overstated. Up until the time of Pet Sounds, The five Beach Boys themselves played on 98% if their own tracks. Brian first encountered the Wrecking Crew guys when recording Surf City with Jan and Dean, but didn't begin actually using them until a year later during the Shut Down Vol. 2 recording sessions, and then only on the remake of Why Do Fools Fall in Love. He would occasionally use Hal to overdub percussion (I Get Around) or to add another drum part (Fun, Fun, Fun), or have Steve Douglas or Jay Miglori to add horns. The only singles the crew played on prior to Pet Sounds were California Girls (w/Carl Wilson on lead guitar) and Help Me Rhonda (again w/Carl on lead). The film gives the uniformed viewer the impression that they played on ALL the Beach Boys hits, and that is simply untrue. The crew was basically there in 1966 and 1967 and seen seldom thereafter. As for the Byrds, the crew played on a total of three tracks (Mr. Tambourine Man, I Knew I'd Want You, She Don't Care About Time). I've seen it written that the Byrds didn't play at all on the first album, and that's utter bulls***. There are plently of bootlegs out there with studio chatter that dispel this myth, as well as the aforementioned AFM sheets. True, Jim Gordon replaced Mike Clarke during the ""Notorious Byrd Brothers"" sessions, but he was leaving the group anyway. Overall, the film was enjoyable, but I have a problem when someone is given credit for work they didn't do. Hell, The Crew played on enough great songs that their legacy is assured without resorting to flat out lies.",1434844800,18,1943,4.664723032069971
7041332,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"I love it, this showed me how and who created the guitar licks, saxophone bits, piano-ing, to do all magical and memorable things that got our attention starting with Ricky Nelson in his TV show in the late 50's through groups and duos in the 60's and on into the 70's doing the performance behind the scene for singers, duos, and famous groups. Largely unknown, underpaid, and almost entirely un-credited until recently admitted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the Wrecking Crew was everybody's go to band for the recordings we heard on the radio and bought on records. I thought the magic was Phil Spector, and while he had his role it wasn't near what I thought it was. Ever wonder why the actual bands weren't as good live (maybe you were too enthralled to notice)? It's because the Wrecking Crew did much of the original recording that made it into our records. When possible musicians willing to learn learned the tricks the Wrecking Crew used from the Crew itself. Even what I've said so far doesn't say it all, because many of the things you love were even written by the crew, or the key parts were suggested by the Crew. Herb Alpert's Lonely Bull (first hit, Billboard for a year!) would have never been anything and Alpert may have never made it if the Crew hadn't given him the magic. To his credit Alpert paid union fines and earned the union ire by writing proper payments ""Scale""  to what were otherwise ""session musicians"" who would remain unknown. The Crew also was ""instrumental"" in getting Frank Sinatra his first #1 Hit on Billboard (Something Stupid with his daughter Nancy). So even Old Blue Eyes needed the Crew to push him to the top!. Often when bands like the Beach Boys toured the Wrecking Crew did 100% of the instrumental sound track recording without a Beach Boy in town, the same for the Monkeys who spent their time making the TV show. Then the bands we know just had to show up and sing. The Wrecking Crew was so skillful that they also knocked out all these hits in minutes or hours. The Wrecking Crew knocked out Turn, Turn, Turn for the Byrds in several hours, the second track of the album done only by the Byrds themselves took the actual Byrds  3 days and 72 takes. Others learned the lesson and conceded that the Wrecking Crew could just do it better and sought them out straight-away. These folks had such a major role in music that we loved, music that defined our generation, and yet they struggled with long and bad hours away from home just like us to feed their family and put a roof over their head. For too long others took or received the credit. Watch this and know who it was that made that music. To list all the artist and group names and all the hits helped by the Crew would take more space than this review. To complete the picture don't forget to see ""Standing In The Shadows Of Motown"" (where the Funk Brothers were the un-credited heroes), and lastly ""Muscle Shoals"" and that about covers it. Sure Dennis Wilson was a friend of Charles Manson and he let Charles and his girls stay at his Malibu Canyon cabin (before the murders), and yes Glen Campbell was a Beach Boy for a time, you learned that elsewhere already.

. . . . .

This documentary film is an ecstatic love letter to the so-called Wrecking Crew, a loose-knit cadre of professional musicians who were hottest session players in LA in the 1960s and early '70s. The film is directed by Denny Tedesco, son of the late, legendary guitarist Tommy Tedesco who, along with drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, saxophonist Plas Johnson and about a dozen others, formed the core group which played on a bazillion hit records. They were Phil Spector's house band during the early '60s girl-group era, and once their reputation was established, went on to play on studio albums by the Beach Boys, Herb Alpert, Glen Campbell, The Monkees, Nancy Sinatra and The Association (to name a few) as well as on countless TV shows, cutting the themes for ""Hawaii 5-0"" and other classics.

Basically, these folks were so good that they were constantly in demand up until the disco era, and the soundtrack of this film features a jaw-dropping parade of mega-hits and testimonials by the singers and producers who worked with them over the years. In formal, movie-making terms, there are some flaws to the film: viewers are expected to know all the music already and go, ""wow! they played on that one, too?!?!"" every time the soundtrack changes. If you're not familiar with '60s pop, a lot of it may be lost on you. Also, Denny Tedesco is quite open about the film being an homage to his father and his contemporaries, and as such is may be less critical or exploratory than it otherwise might have been if it had been made by a director with more distance and subjectivity. However, he also had a rapport with the artists that might have been impossible for anyone else to establish -- they are clearly comfortable with their interviews and ease into memories that are as joyful as they are rueful.

I do wish the film had done a better job framing what happened when the landscape changed and the Wrecking Crew stopped being the A-list players... There's an abrupt shift when Hal Blaine recounts how his mid-1970s divorce ruined him financially, but how that coincided with the downturn of his career isn't quite made clear. The musicians are philosophical about it, saying that show business is tough, and when you're hot, you're hot, but it can't last forever. The transition from a giddy, buoyant era of early rock'n'roll -- when everything was new and all the hot licks hadn't been recorded yet -- to the slick, multi-tracked hyper-professionalism of the 'Seventies is alluded to, but not fully explored. They do talk about how 'Seventies bands differed from 'Sixties artists like the Monkees, who were content to let the labels call the shots and have the Wrecking Crew play on their albums: after the Beatles, the singer-songwriter model took hold and bands wanted to actually play on their own albums. Also, a whole generation of musicians came of age listening to the records the Wrecking Crew created and learning to copy their licks. Once upon a time, nobody could pick the guitar like Tedesco did, but within a few years, countless rockers could, and did, and the work went elsewhere.

Another aspect that the film doesn't deal with is that of other competing studio scenes... Tedesco frames the success of the Wrecking Crew strictly in terms of New York-vs-LA but neglects the considerable hitmaking success of the Motown label and the shift in the '70s to African-American soul and disco, with the Philly sound coming into vogue, as well as the Southern superpickers in Nashville and Muscle Shoals. Yeah, a lot of Top Forty superhits came from LA, but that wasn't the whole picture.

Regardless, this film is a pop culture gem, particularly for music fans who've learned to scour liner notes for info about the producers and sidemen who sculpted the great records of the era. The Wrecking Crew may have labored anonymously while the headliners reaped the glory, but now their moment has come, and they are being celebrated at last. A joyful film, filled with great music and great stories. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)",1434672000,4,4108,4.837837837837838

7041344,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"so worth the wait!  :)  Any music history buff knows that this film has been a while in the making - and we're all so glad to see hit the stores!  I was very blessed to see it in theaters in my area on a very limited run.  I'm of the generation that came after this:  my parents were high-schoolers of the early 1960s, so this music is very literally in my DNA.  When I was a young kid, my first exposure to pop music before I was aware of my own friends' music, was that of my parents which included generous amounts of Motown, The Beach Boys, The Monkees,  Beatles,  etc.

And since I am a voracious reader of music history books, I was aware of the Wrecking Crew for years.  I am so glad to see them get their due.  People like Hal Blaine, Tommy Tedesco, and Carol Kaye (not to mention Glen Campbell, Joe Osborn, and the rest) are easily among the best musicians ever on their instruments.  And their ability to enhance and transcend the recordings that they played on, made for some of the greatest work of the era.

It is filled with fun ancedotes and great music.  The spots where Tommy Tedesco notes that he played the exact same guitar licks on separate Spanish, Mexican, and Bolivian sessions was hilarious, and so were some of interjections Hal B.

7041349,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"Review of Bluray - If you only saw the film you still need the BD with SIX hours of bonuses! (Details below)

(Note added 6/17 in response to a question: The DVD version is two-discs and I'm told - by the PR firm-  that it contains all the same bonus materials as the one-DVD version.)

Okay, so today is the release date of this Bluray disc and there are already 237 reviews posted! This is because Amazon groups all reviews of all formats of a film (theatrical, streaming and DVD and BD). The film was released to theaters a few months ago (and I saw it two years ago at a film festival) and it was available for streaming last month. BUT the Bluray was not out yet! I just got my advance copy the other day and I'm still not finished it. Why? Because the film itself is 104 minutes BUT Director Denny Tedesco (son of the legendary ""Wrecking Crew"" guitarist Tommy Tedesco, has given us an AMAZING present by utilizing the high capacity of BD to add ANOTHER SIX HOURS of bonus material in the form of interview clips he recorded over the last 20 years in making this film. (Tedesco even told me there is more.)

Sure, I could go into the details of the film and who the ""Wrecking Crew"" was (and why they were so important to recordings of the 50s 60s, 70 and 80s. (who played guitar on many Beach Boys records?, Who played sax on ""The Pink Panther"", and who were the ""real"" members of The T-Bones and The Routers? It was THWC) but I'll let you scan the other reviews for info like that.  I'd rather use this space top say: ""If you've only seen the film, you've only seen one -seventh of it! Get this BD NOW!

What a lot of folks still don't understand is that every time a music performance is included in a film or DVD, the director needs to ""license"" both the music and the performance. With so many sound clips here. Tedesco had a LARGE rights bill. In fact the inside of the case holding the disc, there is a long list of the song credits. Tedesco did a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to buy these rights and I - for one - am so glad he succeeded. I've been waiting for two long years for this release and thrilled it's here. (And so will you. There are stories here that have never been told until now!
There is also a companion trade paperback to the film. I've just started reading it. But now I have to get back to finishing the rest of the BD bonus interviews!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful!

There is a similar story about the Motown studio musicians in Detroit who played on all of the great Motown hits of the 1960s. Nashville was another place where a small group of studio musicians were used for numerous hit records by country artists. New York City had a similar group who played on all of the great Jazz albums of the 1960s. Even the Beatles used studio musicians from time to time to augment their recordings. Remember the 5th Beatle, Billy Preston? Studio musicians needed to be able to instantly learn and play the music perfect the first time because time meant money and recording studio time was expensive. Often times these musicians could do a better job and faster than the musicians who were members of the group making the record (like the Beach Boys who sang but did not play on their own records). This movie is a must see for anyone interested in how music was produced during the 1960s.

7041378,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"To say that documentary maker Denny Tedesco had a long, long hard day's night making this documentary, is a real understatement... You'd think that the record companies would've given him all the music clips for free, what with the film sparking new interest in their 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's inventories. With CD's in decline, you'd think it would be a win/win for everyone, but no. Denny had to raise the money for each and every single piece of music in this definitive salute to all those great hits.

The WRECKING CREW (WC), were not only the very best, they were the fastest stock company of session musicians in history. From the BEACH BOYS to SINATRA, From SURF CITY to STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT, and everything in between, the WC could play to any beat. I think if they had known that their work would be forever heard on radios and record/cassette/CD players 24/7 continuously throughout the world for over half a century, they might have asked for billing credit. But not getting credit was the whole idea back in the day, the public had to believe all those groups did play their own instruments. The WC had to remain in the shadows...

But thanks to Denny, the raw energy behind the whole project, who's father Tommy Tedesco was among the best guitar players ever, with so many iconic credits, like the intro to TV's BONANZA... Thanks to his dedication and resolve in bringing together not just the musicians, but the producers, writers, arrangers and mixers, and the singers -well, it lays down the true history behind all those great tracks like no other documentary has ever done.

When you look at what the music scene offers today, and compare it with what the WC gave us back in our youth... Yes, we were truly blessed to live with such memorable sounds, with such diversity, and with such meaning. THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT saluted the great MGM movie musicals, THE WRECKING CREW salutes the great music we heard everywhere we went.

7041379,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"I was fortunate enough to have seen a special screening of this film last year at the Rialto Theatre in Joliet, Il.  In addition to the film, there was a Q & A with the director, Denny Tedesco.  It was one of the best evenings of my life.  First of all, the film was incredible....to think that this one group of studio musicians A.) provided the sounds to virtually every west coast group of the 60's and B.) did so while giving each group their own individual sound.  If you listen to the Beach Boys, their sound is different from the Grass Roots, which is different from Sonny & Cher, which is different from Elvis Presley, who is different from Frank Sinatra, who is different from the Monkees, etc. etc....and yet, it was all the same musicians.  That goes beyond playing....it goes to genius.  I never wanted the movie to end, and yet when it did, and Denny Tedesco took questions from the audience, it was even better still.  A great man and son of the great Tommy Tedesco.  Very knowledgeable and very nice guy.  It's funny to think that when it came out that the Monkees were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, everyone went up in arms....so much so that even to this day, they have NOT been inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which is criminal, to my way of thinking.  And yet, through the film, you discover that NO ONE was playing their own instruments back then.  In fact, truth be told, the Monkees fought for and gained control over their music and eventually, beginning with Headquarters, played on all of their following albums.

At any rate, you will have but one regret upon seeing this film.....that it does finally come to an end, as do all good things.",1432339200,3,1715,4.461538461538462

to come up with an album...or...they could use the studio hotshots who could
crank out exactly what the record company wanted quick, clean and fast.

7041399,4,B00UHJ7J8U,"Having read Kent Hartman's book The Wrecking Crew, I was eager to see this movie with footage, interviews, and hear the music. It took them a long time to raise the money for all the copyright licenses for all the songs in the documentary--about 60 of them. I enjoyed this, though I expected some more details as in the book. I would suggest to people to read the book as well in order to get an even fuller picture, and some interesting stories. It's a fascinating look into the music industry in the 60s when hits were being churned out largely due to session musicians unbeknownst to the public. The Brill Building song writers, the Wrecking Crew, the musicians in the documentary Standing In The Shadows Of Motown, and the back-up singers of 20 Feet From Stardom all bring to light this kind of undercover world of music. Glen Campbell was the only one to go on to stardom from this group of session players.

This should be eye-opening for those who didn't know that band members weren't always playing on their records and why. If one feels sorry that they weren't credited, they were making very good money as they point out in the film. Keep in mind, that there are a whole lot more session players like this group of musicians who people didn't know played on rock albums, such as Jimmy Page, Steve Hunter, Dick Wagner, et al., and they weren't credited on the records either. Some fans have felt fooled when finding out a band member didn't play on this or that song, but keep in mind, albums were for the producers and record companies, and they simply wanted them to sound as perfect as possible since those would last forever. The bands still had to learn to play live. Check it out.",1430784000,,1696,4.52442996742671
7041400,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. YOU MAY WISH TO READ IT AFTER VIEWING THE FILM. Of course it's the core audience for this documentary, people really into Sixties music, who will be the main audience for this excellent documentary, but I hope the casual viewer will also discover it. In any case it will be the production of record for the history of the phenomenon of the Wrecking Crew in popular music history. There is also Hal Blaine's book, ""Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew"" which is a good and informative read, but far more people will see this film than read that book.

As culture and music changed in the Sixties, so did the locus of music making itself. New York, seemingly always the capital of the entire entertainment world gradually lost its place to L.A. by the end of the early sixties, particularly in pop music but as the culture-generating center of the country. L.A. became the biggest center of the recording business and it was here the very loosely affiliated group known as the Wrecking Crew gradually came and worked mostly anonymously on an astounding number of records of the Sixties and Seventies. These people, many of whom were born between 1935 and 1940, were young enough to be able to relate to the feel of rock'n'roll, and so were able to play it. The previous generation of studio musicians (who were often referred to as ""the suits"" by the newer musicians), not only didn't have the feel for the new rock and rock-influenced pop music, but they actually looked down on it, some, like Columbia's Mitch Miller with vehement hatred. Thus the ""Wrecking Crew"" began as a nickname of derision for these new people who were ruining music.

It didn't matter. They became a necessary part of the L.A. music scene and could play easy listening, jazz, surf music, the girl group wall of sound of Phil Spector, sunshine pop, and rock groups. It was only in the last category that they became controversial. For most of the history of music and all of recorded music no one expected singers to play instruments too. If you could sing well, that was enough. There were singers with guitars from the folk scene, but that was about it. So the prseence of studio musicians on the albums of Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole or Ray Charles was expected.

But the Beatles changed everything from 1964 on. The Beatles brought back the self-contained guitar based band, which hadn't been around since a brief resurgence in the early rock'n'roll period by bands like Bill Haley and the Comets. But this time it was much bigger and many such groups followed on the heels of Beatles until they became the major type of group from the mid Sixties on. The early generations were usually some group of good kids, often talented, who had played around a bit then suddenly had a big hit. But these kids, however enthusiastic they were, were not able to play their instruments to the standard of recordings as they had developed.

The record business through engineering, had gotten everyone used to completely note-perfect, flawless recordings. It was simply expected anymore, certainly by the Sixties. Yet even the most famous classical musicians made mistakes on stage. As Horowitz would say when he hit a sour note, "" With Horowitz you get Horowitz"". The same applied to most of these early groups. Sure, they could play onstage with all the excitement of the crowd, girls screaming and all that. A few bad notes and shaky passages wouldn't be noticed. But on a recording, totally different story. The public wouldn't accept the results. Mostly, even if they could play their instrument, they couldn't play tight as a unit. These bands sprung up very quickly and hadn't had the time to really become a tight band.

Thus the need for the Wrecking Crew, who could not only play their instruments (often multiple instruments) expertly, but who played together often enough to become a virtual band of exchangeable players. But it was important for the band whose name was on the album to be the assumed players on the albums, leading to the Wrecking Crew being kept somewhat secret and their names kept off the backs of the albums. They did get named often enough for their names to be somewhat familiar to me and I assume others, but I never would have guessed most of the groups they subbed for on record. The beach Boys were an exception as Brian Wilson explains in the film: the band was on the road all the time without him and that was combined with an increasingly multi-tracked complexity in his music. The Byrds, well that case is a bit overblown as it's been documented that it was only on one song, Mr. Tambourine Man, though Roger McGuinn notes that song took five takes while Turn! Turn!Turn! took seventeen. By 1968 new groups like Crosby, Stills & Nash, Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, COULD play well on record and the Wrecking Crew continued in less controversial ways backing singers who you would expect to employ backup musicians.

The documentary is nicely put together, especially considering that it has to rely largely on still photos, many of them black & white. This is made up for by numerous interviews with some of the biggest producers and artists of the era. There are also recurring clips from a roundtable discussion from four of the principals, Hal Blaine, Tommy Tedesco, Carol Kaye and Plas Johnson. All of this is nicely tied together with colorful Sixties graphics. It was all lovingly put together by Denny Tedesco, Tommy's son. One might hope for even more interviews from more Wrecking Crew members, but this does a very good job of recognizing the talents and contributions from this mostly unheralded group of musicians.",1430784000,,5680,4.7731434384537135

Most weren't given credits for their important roles in the music of the era, through they were paid for their work. It was informative, and covered the territory pretty well, though I would have liked to have had more depth from the musicians in some of the interviews. These musicians, we discover, worked so much that they became very, very accomplished technicians, not to mention very versatile in what they played. They gave a West Coast vibe and sound to the popular music they were paid to improve upon and play. Though many were Jazz musicians, for example, they readily adapted to rock'n'roll and popular music of the era, and excelled at it. Indeed, they were pioneers.

7041425,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"If you grew up in the 60s or like the music it produced, youll love this movie. Its the story of a legendary bunch of LA session artists responsible for much of what we think of as the sounds of the Beach Boys, the Mamas and the Papas, Jan and Dean, the Monkees, the Byrds, and many other famous groups of the era. Better yet, it includes generous helpings of the music the Wrecking Crew gave us.

Why the Wrecking Crew? According to one of the members, its because the older studio musicians they replaced said they were going to wreck the music industry with their trashy rock and roll. As if!

The films a heartfelt tribute to the music as well as the musicians, and it's also a labor of family love. The producer, Denny Tedesco, is the son of guitarist Tommy Tedesco, perhaps the most legendary member of the Wrecking Crew. He died in 1997, a year after Denny started the project.

1997? you marvel. It took 18 years to get this done?

Well, yes and no. The film was completed in 2008 and traveled the festival circuit, where it drew critical raves and won at least 12 awards, including one from as far off as Alaska! But it couldn't be shown commercially because Denny didn't have the money--supposedly north of $700K--for the rights to the famous music at the heart of the film.

He finally did round up the cash--partly through a Kickstarter campaign!--and its lucky for us he did. Now we can all watch it, and even give Denny a little payback for the long and heroic effort that brought this artistic marvel to our screens.

Anyway, it is pretty cool documentary for anyone who was around for the music of the 60s and 70s and historical info for younger crowd of a time when musicians actually had to play music rather than just rip off samples of old music and yell ""make some noise"" grab there crotch and whine (rap) about how hard there life is and how women should perform....on them. Anyway, as most documentaries with interview format it does drag a bit but is entertaining. Director is not KenBurns after all. My friend Tom spoke with his friend Carol Kaye who did not have good things to say about the project and denied the name Wrecking Crew. Well, in the first minutes it is mentioned that that name may be fictional or a label given by other. Also, she is very prominent in the film both in commentary and screen time and in my opinion comes off looking fabulous. So surprised she is not pleased because this is a great tribute to her and showcases some legendary contributions she made in very famous recordings. Also features Glenn Campbell who is ending his life in a sad disease. Of course it heavily features Tommy Tedesco as the film was made by son Denny Tedesco. So I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Probably the best music industry flick, documentary or fiction.  Its mostly the actual musicians and related people working in industry.  Interviews.  Stories.  Archival footage together with modern interviews.  Rise, peak years, and downside (when more recordings were performed by the bands/acts and fewer by session musicians).  The soundtrack is 100% the music involved in the story.  No social narrative or another layer clouding a great story.  Just the story.

And I am a baby boomer and a lot of this music does resonate.  But even for folk that think of the 60's as historical, the story is a great one to listen to and hear.",1428192000,,699,4.830508474576271

It was wonderful to actually be able to see and learn about these truly remarkable, multi talented musicians.  Their knowledge of and ability to switch between so many different styles of music was truly amazing.  From a basic rock and roll tune to an elaborate movie score and, literally, everything in between, this group of musicians masterfully covered them all.  They, quite simply, were the best!

People like me that play music come across these names and they continue to inspire and are our heroes. Jamerson, Osborn, Kaye, etc. are bassists that laid it down, hit after hit, year after year.

What is odd is that even the songs I disdained as a kid (Sonny & Cher & Nancy S were NOT cool with my crowd) are just a joy to hear. The talent displayed in this film is breathtaking.

7041497,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"First of all, I'm a baby boomer, so my most formative years were spent listening to the music featured here.  I had the pleasure of seeing this documentary about 3 years ago at a live screening in Indian Wells, California during the fundraising leg of the journey, where several of the musicians from the 'Wrecking Crew' group toured around the country previewing the film and then hosting a Q/A and autograph session afterward.  For the last 3 years, I've been waiting for these guys to reach their goal of bringing this film to public release and DVD; I've been checking their website monthly to follow their progress, and now I'm thrilled beyond words that I will be able to order a copy for myself as well as copies for a number of friends who also grew up on this music.  The reason for the fundraising drive and the delay in release was due to the huge expense of buying the rights to every single music clip in the film (and there are LOTS of them).  As music can do, the clips of each song brought back very specific memories of my life.  What a great ride this is, to learn how so many of those songs came about.  This documentary is a genuine treat, and will bring a newfound insight and respect for the music we grew up with.
As an aside, and in agreement with the other (first) reviewer, I don't understand why Carol Kaye so clearly has a vendetta against the film, which gives her the credit she deserves for her very substantial part in the creation of some of the most memorable songs of the time.  (If you aren't sure what I'm referring to, hunt around a bit on Amazon and you'll see her many, many comments and responses to posts regarding this film.)",1427587200,60,1668,4.413680781758957

7041504,5,B00UHJ7J8U,"After seeing this film last night, I can't wait to review it. I'm perplexed as to why Carol Kaye finds this cinematic effort offensive. If , as she has implied, the film is revisionist, I'm missing her point given the fact that she, Tommy Tedesco, Hal Blaine, and others participate in a panel discussion that runs throughout the course of the film. I'm not arguing her perspective-I wasn't there- and she has always been among my favorite musicians, so I mean no disrespect.
  I see the film as a labor of love on the part of Danny Tedesco and a virtual love song to all of the musicians, including Ms, Kaye, that gave of themselves throughout that time period. Carol Kaye is portrayed as one of the most brilliant bass players of that era, and for that matter, every musician who participated in those recordings is celebrated for their brilliance, ingenuity, and craftsmanship.. My jaw literally dropped several
times during the film, and I can't remember every feeling so filled with joy and thankfulness for having been born at the right time and having been able to be a listener to all this incredible music when I was growing up. I can't wait to buy it on Blu Ray.",1427414400,179,1172,4.6028708133971294

7041512,4,B00UHJ7J8U,"Let me say up front, the only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 was I wasn't a huge fan of how the documentary flowed and I wished they would have gone a bit more in-depth about some of the music everyone had worked on. That aside, this was a great documentary about the many, many unsung heroes of the early rock era. These musicians played on pretty much everything you heard if you grew up in the 60s and 70s, across all types of music, and they deserved every penny they made, every gold and platinum record they got and Grammies out the wazoo, whether they got those or not. I can't do this film justice in a review here, so just watch it and be amazed at all of the big and little things you'll learn, like the fact that the same woman who played bass on the Mission: Impossible theme also just made up, on the spot, the bass-line you hear on ""I Got You Babe"" from the original, kind of dull line, given her by the writers. (They did that a lot, actually. Just be given the music in the studio and create the arrangements, jazz up the drums, add Flamenco flourishes to the guitars and create the music that you instantly recognize as classics.) If nothing else, you'll see why Brian Wilson brought in The Wrecking Crew to play on Pet Sounds (and pretty much every Beach Boys album after) instead of having the real Beach Boys play.",1427328000,,1340,4.2795275590551185

If you are expecting a story that has a beginning, middle and end with one character and the rest all work around it. You aren't going to get that. What you are going to get is essentially eaves dropping on conversations with people who were really there. You'll hear great stories, just like sitting around in a living room and talking about this great time in music. My only regret, as has been stated elsewhere, is that the movie isn't longer. I'm very happy filming started several years ago when some of the people were still alive so you get to hear them actually tell their story instead of someone else relaying it. This is a fantastic movie and I am so glad I rented it. If you love the 60s and 70s music and want to hear the stories of how it all came to life from the people who were actually there, this is the movie to rent. If you want to be entertained by some fictionalized Hollywood created film where actors portray people on screen and re-create what was going on or just watch a bunch of old film from people recording music with no real context and no one explaining the story behind what you are seeing- this is not the movie for you.

And, happily, Denny Tedesco's lovely documentary salute to his Dad, Tommy, and the Crew, lifts the veil on how the music became magic. And along the way, the surviving members of the Crew tell stories, share triumphs, tragedy and regrets.

Highlights? Tons. Carol Kate recreating the bass line to ""The Beat Goes On""-her invention, BTW, mixed with the 50 year old recording. Amazing. Hal Blaine warming up a ""big kit"".

And a jaw-dropping shot of Michelle Phillips, still the real, break the mold California Girl.
