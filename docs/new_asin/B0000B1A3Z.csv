1909708,5,B0000B1A3Z,"Mi espanol es muy malo, sino mi amor En Analfabeto. (My Spanish is not good, but I love ""The Illiterate One."")

After reading about the likes of classic Mexican comedians as Cantinflas and Tin Tan, I decided to check out this and Su Excelencia. I liked this one a whole lot better.

In this film, Cantinflas plays an illiterate carpenter and janitor who gets an inheritance letter. He cannot read it, so he goes to a druggist to read it only to be embarrassed to hear the druggist praise a little girl for reading so well. This makes our hero determined to learn to read the letter himself, which leads to an interesting series of misadventures involving a pretty girl who wins his heart, a sympathetic bank manager who hires him as a janitor, some musician friends, and wicked bank employers who attempt to cruelly exploit his illiteracy.

One cannot help but to admire how Cantinflas' character, in the midst of all of this, retains his good nature and determination to achieve his goals with his dignity intact, and the film itself is quite funny to boot. While the character and storyline transcends barriers of language and culture, one can easily see how Mexican audiences could indentify with our man and cheer his struggles with the educated rich people who try all they could to degrade and humiliate him in this story. This is actually one of the most inspiring comedies I've ever seen and he makes you want to stand up and cheer!

If your Spanish is not that good, the subtitles do a great job. See it and enjoy.",1362096000,4,1523,4.608856088560886

1909714,5,B0000B1A3Z,"Mario Moreno portrays an illiterate poor fellow that has recieved a letter from a dead relative containing a fortune for him, but because hes ashamed of not knowing how to read he decides to go to school and learn before knowing the contents of the letter. The movie doesnt focus on his schooling as much as it does on his new job and his love for a girl. As in other movies, youll encounter the greedy villans, good hearted people, and the charm of Cantinflas.",1108425600,11,461,4.435294117647059
