6866881,5,B00QG6IEDM,"FULLY AND LAVISHLY DRAMATIZED -- BUT IN A VERY NARRATIVE STYLE AS THE DIALOGUE IS EXTRACTED FROM LETTERS, DIARIES, & MEMOIRS

DVD VERSION HAS SDH SUBTITLES BUT THE AMAZON STREAMING GIVES NO OPTION FOR CC

This exceptional documentary made in partnership with the Imperial War Museums has exceptional production values and is highly polished. For those looking specifically for action driven war reenactment, this is a very different kind of documentary (though there is some action). Indeed, this production takes on an ambitious challenge because it is a war documentary that is focused far more on personal stories that are not all combat and almost entirely dialog driven rather than action. It is fully dramatized and does have story arcs as some personalities are followed throughout their experiences while other individuals contribute only a scene or two. All the actors are recounting dialogue once written down in letters or documents, so it is completely a narrative style. However, if one doesn't mind that style, the stories are compelling precisely because they are first hand accounts. Whether it's a touching exchange of two people in a relationship, a personal account of combat experiences, or people explaining how they cope on the home front, this is a moving dramatization of completely real experiences like few other docudramas you will ever find.

NON-COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF CONTENT BY EPISODE:

EPISODE 1: Focuses on the start of the war and individual war experiences with Reg Evans who ships off to France amidst excitement and patriotic fervor among the British public. James Butlin trades Oxford for the trenches. Dorothy Laurence aspires to be a journalist and war correspondent in a ""man's world"", ultimately traveling independent of news agencies (but with help of soldiers here and there). Wealthy Alan Lloyd, who is somewhat a playboy, volunteers and marries his sweetheart before leaving.

EPISODE 2: Focuses a little more on the homefront though there are war accounts. Wounded soldiers return to England and CPT Harold Gillies pioneers early plastic surgery to deal with horrendous wounds. We see more of the effect on the home front in England as people like Hallie Miles writes cook books for meatless meals and keeps her restaurant afloat in hard times. Kate Frye, a suffragette, is asked to organize others to make uniforms for the military.

EPISODE 3: Shows again of the homefront is affected in England as fears grow of invasion in Essex. Zeppelins begin bombing raids. Conscription becomes necessary. Upper middle class Helen Bentwich is contrasted with a young lady in service, Emily and her fiance soldier Will. Helen goes to work for the first time in her life and discovers the difficult conditions in factories providing munitions. She becomes more sensitive to lower class struggles.

EPISODE 4: Focus comes back onto the battles again as some of the bloodiest are fought in 1917-18. Black soldier Arthur Roberts and others recount their experiences in places like Passchendaele, Ypres, and the final push. The affect of the war on social classes and gender are further illustrated with poor government worker Duff Cooper and his fiance Lady Dianna Manners. Helen Bentwich has some interesting developments because of her changing ideology and activism.

The overall connecting narration is given by Olivia Colman and it's outstanding. Those who might not appreciate very emotional content (some viewers may even shed a tear), then this may not meet your tastes. I enjoyed it thoroughly. There are a few glimpses of crimson poppy dappled meadows, CGI battlefield aerials, brief battle dramatizations, a small amount of old WWI footage, and even stately homes here and there. Simply very well done.",1429315200,5,3750,5.227953410981697

6866883,5,B00QG6IEDM,"World War One The People's Story is a brilliant, fresh take on the Great War that is essential viewing for anyone interested in war-themed documentaries. What is perhaps more surprising is that it is also essential viewing for anyone interested in historical drama, as well as straight-forward, true accounting of lives lived and sometimes lost during one of history's most tragic and senseless conflicts.

Using a combination of rare historical footage (as well as some familiar images) with actual letters, diaries and memoirs from the period, World War One The People's Story wisely downplays the political and military overview of the years 1914-1918 and focuses on individuals. The effect is immediately engaging and intimate and the viewer can't help but be drawn into each story being told. Amazingly, this is achieved through actors speaking the source material directly into the camera (as well as occasionally in voice-over). For example, one feels for Reg, the upbeat, kindly young soldier from the slums who faithfully writes home to his mother. When his life is in danger one immediately feels a sense of dread as to his possible fate. Or Hubbins, the newly-married artillery officer whose frank, funny and deeply personal letters to his young bride will have you smiling at their playful use of language (""Hubbins longs to hold close his small wife,"" etc.). The brilliant performances of the mostly unfamiliar actors range from amusing to frustrating to absolutely heart-breaking.

There isn't a false note in this four episode series which manages to cover the first patriotic furor that saw hundreds of thousands of voluntary enlistments at the beginning of the war to the frustrations of conscription as the years dragged on to the impact on the suffragist movement and even to the earliest serious attempts at reconstructive plastic surgery on the thousands of maimed soldiers who survived the carnage but whose scars threatened to make a return to normal life impossible. What is even more astounding is the occasional post script to a sequence which indicates that the letters we've just heard were only recently discovered, either in someone's attic, or packed away in a box somewhere. What is so close to being lost to history is brought vividly to life and serves as a vibrant reminder that so much of our past, much of it personal and therefore so much more accessible than the dry facts of academia, is still out there, awaiting discovery and, hopefully, preservation for generations to come. The tragedy of war is rarely better conveyed than when it is recorded in the words of a young soldier to his sweetheart, in a letter that has been deemed worthy at one time of being kept as the last link to a lost love.

The success of this series is found in its format. The simple, direct readings of the actors into the camera is surprisingly effective. Despite some familiar faces such as Brian Cox and Romola Garai, most of the actors are unfamiliar to North American audiences. This makes them even more believable as their characters. When these living, breathing people from World War One emerge to tell their stories, one can only sit up and take notice. Human beings now are the same as they were then.",1428969600,14,3230,4.966728280961183
6866884,5,B00QG6IEDM,Excellent! So well written. Real stories. Beautifully done.,1427155200,,59,6.5
6866885,5,B00QG6IEDM,"With all the attention to the Second World War over the past few years, it's good to see such a spectacular presentation given to WWI. It salutes individuals in the ranks and those doing their bits at home, not generals and politicians. Ordinary Brits penciled their own stories via diary, memoir, and letter. Love -loss -fear -success -pride -all recovered from attics and basements. Now these lives are dramatized as a documentary with amazing entertaining and educational results. Archival footage is remarkably clear and discernible from realistic reenactment bits only by the color of the later. Heartwarming can suddenly turn to heartache--it's war touching the people, not the leaders.

The most outstanding cast I've ever seen on a war documentary. Many great stars portray the roles of ordinary people and speak their preserved words. A unique and touching viewpoint of the war that unfortunately did NOT end all wars.

SDH SUBTITLES for all four 48-minute episodes.

6866891,5,B00QG6IEDM,"Absolutely and incredibly well-done!  To hear all of the first-hand anecdotes on the experiences and the tragic losses of wartime, without having to actually watch bloody scenes that one is often exposed to in such productions, was simply wonderful.  One is not removed from the tragedy, rather is immersed into it, taken right to the level of human loss and tragedy. Somehow, even more wrenching to me, since [thankfully], one cannot possibly empathize the horrors of war by simply watching it on the screen.",1444608000,2,509,5.0476190476190474
6866892,3,B00QG6IEDM,"Great idea. Well directed, deserves another half star.",1442880000,,54,5.875
6866893,5,B00QG6IEDM,"These poignant stories were taken from actual letters and correspondence now kept in the Imperial War Museum in London from soldiers on the Western Front.  Read by actors and actresses in period garb, they bring the wrenching pain of separation and the horrors of war to life in a manner that just reading the dated prose and quaint endearments in book form could not touch.  The correspondence clearly shows the devastation WWI wrought on lives of men and women from all social classes: hopes of a happy future with loved ones and lives dashed by excruciating losses which often doomed those on the home front to poverty and sorrow.  Deaths of those on the front lines are especially hard when they occurred very near the Armistice.  An aside is that plastic surgery made incredible advances because horrific wounds required new techniques.  All these accounts share a common innocence of a simpler, optimistic time shattered forever by an all consuming war that would change lives forever.",1442707200,,991,4.9818181818181815

6866898,4,B00QG6IEDM,"Incredibly poignant and so touching in its approach to  dramatizing the reports of real people touched by the ""The Great War,"" my grandfather's war. I wish that he could have seen this series. I believe that he would truly have enjoyed knowing that he wasn't alone in his experiences. He, like so many others, was not able to discuss freely what he went through in World War I. Society, at least American Society just didn't allow men the freedom to openly discuss their feelings. It wasn't considered manly. How wonderful that these archives have been opened and that these stories are being shared. They help make all of us more sensitive to the horrors of armed conflict.",1436745600,3,674,4.760683760683761

6866901,5,B00QG6IEDM,Excellent documentary series on WWI from the point of view of those who fought and those left back home to wait. They state at the end that there are thousands of letters and diaries that still exists in museums and private homes. I would like to see more seasons of this series since it is possible to do so.,1434326400,3,309,4.254237288135593
6866902,5,B00QG6IEDM,"It was called 'The Great War,' although only its losses were 'great,' staggering numbers of losses unimaginable to the loved ones left behind. We often hear it referenced in period shows like Downton Abbey and Mr. Selfridge, but this four-episode series brings its heartbreak home with personal stories. A deft combination of re-enactments and historical footage, this unusual documentary shows the war's effects on a handful of British individuals--whether newlyweds, parents, children, friends--and unfolds the stories of poignancy, love, determination, fear. World War One, so far removed from today's fast-paced world and its horrors scarcely imaginable, has not received the belated attention of WWII, whose participants have been dubbed 'the greatest generation.' The generation just before 'the greatest' carried its own burdens, its unthinkable grief at war's presence in their lives. This thoughtful DVD set, with superb production values and skillful narration by Olivia Colman, reminds us, through the letters and recollections of real-life people, that war's costs are always so much higher than any official 'accounting' can describe. The loss of lives, of dreams, and of a time now folded into the history books, should be noted, and reflected upon. We owe it to those who lived it to remember them.",1433980800,2,1313,5.5049504950495045

The only disappointment is they should have kept the original Brit title, The Great War (rather than World War One): The People's Story.

It is a new take on the personal experiences of this most traumatic time in human history. The scale of loss and destruction was previously--completely unknown, This was Until some time after the war, when the monumental fatalities were known, and the previously, and officially, subdued press, was aloud to visit and report on the war areas. With the aid of photography, the visual horror was magnified. For those waiting anxiously at home, their personal experiences are re-enacted and read aloud,  by noted and well known, actors. Movingly and with great sensitivity---each story is revealed. My only regret--is a personal one. With incredible stupidity, the Uk's commercial TV station  -ITV--who commissioned this great series--NEVER issued it on DVD in the UK.
