2211817,1,B0007GP7FK,"I'm usually really forgiving for movies people dismiss as junk, epically monster movies, but this...I wouldn't even say this movie rivals 'made for TV' movies.  The directing was bad, the acting was embarrassing, the story boring, and the sets were funded by the local dollar store.  Stick to your neighbors home movies, there probably scarier.",1129248000,3,344,5.236363636363636
2211818,1,B0007GP7FK,"Purportedly based on a short story by DRACULA scribe Bram Stoker, WAY OF THE VAMPIRE is a ridiculous, poorly directed and acted, waste of celluloid.  Van Helsing (a stoic but bland Rhett Giles) is cursed with eternal life until all the darkest princes are destroyed.  After a beheading of Dracula (a cameo by action star Paul Logan), Van Helsing lives through time until we meet up with him in present day Los Angeles. Vampires are a pitiful lot now, unable to hunt due to the curse of being caught and destroyed.  However, led on by their leader Sebastian, they return to the hunt.  Meanwhile Van Helsing assembled a motley crew of vampire slayers and the confrontation begins.  The movie is hopelessly dull and offers no genuine thrills or chills.  Another movie that gives support to the overkill of the Dracula legend, and proof that a truly original vampire movie or at least a refreshing update is hard to find.",1125792000,6,917,4.735849056603773
2211819,1,B0007GP7FK,"First of all, I love vampire movies.  Even campy ones.  But they better be good campy.  This was neither.  I gave this movie one star because it did show blood.  That is the only thing reasonable I can say about a movie so cheap looking that most of the actresses in it look as if they should be porn stars.

There is a plot, I quess.  Van Helsing is brassed off that his ""true love"" was killed by Dracula.  So he becomes immortal himself, fast forward 100 yrs, and sets about killing off the remaining vamps.

That's it.  Bram Stoker should rise from his grave and haunt the idiots who made this movie.",1117152000,26,603,4.256637168141593

Helsing didn't have has strength or speed. Why didn't this vamps buy a blood bank or get the homeless. In LA there is plenty to live off. They won't be missed. That part really piss me off. The main villian didn't have any real plans. There is  black vamp chick. She was always yeahing and dude was like yo. I just want some booty. I don't what was worse the vamps crew or vamp helsing crew. You just wanted both of them to died. Please somethign bite n stake these actors. I can say that Van Helsing crew is a bit more organize.

2212090,1,B0007GP7FK,"This movie HAD potential with a good story, but the bad acting and low budget put a stake through this movies heart. Asylum (Sci-Fi channel?) brings us another masterpiece which actually looks like it may have been filmed in one day-maybe.
Van Helsing kills Dracula but mistakenly leaves his (way to hot for him) wife under the care of one of Dracula's princes (Sebastian). This prince bites her and Van Helsing is forced to put an end to her before she turns. Van Helsing takes a vow to remain immortal until the last vampire is killed off. The movie moves fast forward to modern day LA where the vampires are leading a rat life existence until Sebastien decides that they will feed on humans again taunting the fact that Van Helsing will find and kill them.
The acting is just too robotic and over the top that it turns into a comedy... This is why there are `starving actors' in Hollywood because these people think they can act just like all the fools who believe (in the beginning anyway) they can sing on American Idol.
Sebastien- We must feed on the humans.
Arianna(screaming way too loud-Sebastien is 3 feet from her)- But what about Van Helsing??!!!!!! He will kill us all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There are a few bonus nudity shots with girls (as one reviewer wrote) that appear to be porn film stars not with the ""just the girl next door look'-at least not next door to me!!

2212093,1,B0007GP7FK,"No, this is not `Dracula.' Not even `Dracula vs. Frankenstein.' This is yet another quickly-made, cheaper version of vampire flick that has nothing to so with Bram Stoker. And here is my advice: Don't watch it! No, don't even think about it.

The Asylum, independent film company which produced such films as `H. G. Well's War of the Worlds' (no, not Tom Cruise version, but C. T. Howell's) and `Frankenstein Reborn' in 2005 alone, gives another low-budget direct-to-video film. Having seen the first one, I expected little from this `Van Helsing' clone, but I never expected that this could be such a wretched film!

The film opens with evocative black and white images of the vampire hunters including Helsing (Rhett Giles), who are going to hunt down the Dracula and other vampires. It was 100 years ago, and Helsing succeeds in his mission, but has to pay the price later, losing his wife he left behind.

And Dr. Abraham Van Helsing is still living as young handsome doctor in one LA hospital because he was given an eternal life by the Catholic Church in order to kill all the vampire princes on earth. Until then, he is not allowed to die.

To be fair, the story is not bad. But the shoddy editing and poor acting ruin what little merit `Way of the Vampire' has in the first five minutes. I am willing to turn a blind eye to the low-budget production designs, but this is unacceptable. Lighting is so dark that you cannot see the actions clear enough, and the `stake' that should be driven into the heart of vampire looks like a sprig.

There is no `so-bad-so-good' fun here. Not even campy fun as in `Scream Blacula Scream.' Avoid this, and see Hugh Jackman's `Van Helsing' instead, It is not a classic, but 100 times more entertaining.",1139788800,10,1744,4.631067961165049
2212094,1,B0007GP7FK,"The sets, the costumes, the story, the actors, all have potential. It just doesn't come alive to a level at which you get transported into the movie.

When Sebastian and his girlfriend discuss hunting again, you would think you are in an x-rated movie from the sounds they make. Not good.

All through the scenes, the actors make grandiose statements that are not accompanied by good acting, so the statements sound really fake.

The prostitute just stands there, her back to a white wall, half dressed, in broad daylight. Not real.

The doctor and the nurse discuss the vampire victim like she were the only patient in the entire hospital. They look too fresh and manicured, which comes off as very fake.

Sorry director of this movie, you missed too many things. Not worth moviegoer time.",1135900800,3,790,4.779411764705882
2212095,1,B0007GP7FK,"WARNING: possible spoilers ahead.

Leave it to the Asylum to put out what might be the worst vampire movie since Dracula 3000. At least Dracula 3000 had a little bit of campy humor to it, this one takes itself seriously the whole way through and it's just pathetic.

This horrible attack on your eyes and mind begins with a bunch of vampire hunters, led by Abraham Van Helsing, going into a castle and try to kill Dracula, like a destitute man's version of Stephen Sommers' terrifically horrible VAN HELSING. Anyway, Van Helsing manages to kill Dracula, but he doesn't have much time to savor his victory before some super model with goofy fake teeth tells him that they are legion and he'll never be able to extinguish them completely. Our Van Helsing (this guy is so NOT Hugh Jackman) stews and tries to smolder in front of the camera. Fade to black.

Cut to Los Angeles, present day.

Van Helsing now has a short hair cut. He's still trying to hunt down all the vampires and kill them. I'm not quite sure why Van Helsing is still alive after all this time. I'm sure it was discussed somewhere in the movie, probably after I tuned out mentally - around the twenty minute mark. But going by movie logic, I just figured there was some kind of magic amulet or potion or curse that made him into a Highlander. So, Van Helsing rounds up a new crew of vampire hunters. Meanwhile, the vampires are getting ready for a war of their own. I guess you could say this is trying to be something like BLADE meets VAN HELSING. The guy who plays Van Helsing is trying to channel Hugh Jackman, and the guy that plays the vampire heavy is clearly going for a Stephen Dorff thing. They both fail miserably.

Maybe it's not entirely their fault. The worst thing you can do as a director is let a bad actor play a cowboy or a vampire. It brings out the worst in everyone. You give a bad actor a cowboy hat or a set of fangs, and watch out. As bad as they were, they will become ten times worse. But I digress. Bottom line is, avoid this one. Don't be fooled by the title, this rotten pile of cinematic garbage would make Bram Stoker roll in his grave. He wouldn't be stoked at all to see this thing with his name on it.",1135296000,3,2200,4.317191283292979

In those instances I was left thinking that surely somebody else must have written those books? What were they thinking?? Novel vs Movie, but the comparision comes to the same conclusion, to myself anyway. I guess it's a mistake to expect a certain level of excellence, regardless of the name attached.
