5742194,3,B00CV922RM,"My co worker kept telling me about how awesome these movies were but when I finally saw IP Man and IP Man 2, I was truly blown away by the martial arts in these two films.  It's been awhile since I've seen a good Chinese martial arts film and IP Man took my breath away! I haven't seen IP Man 3 yet, but I've viewed the trailer and I'm confident IP Man 3 won't disappoint.  Just wondering why Donnie Yen who orinally starred in IP Man 1 & 2 didn't star in IP Man 3?",1377129600,2,465,3.8842105263157896
5742195,2,B00CV922RM,"After hearing that the legendary Anthony Wong would be playing the Wing Chun master in this latest installment of the Ip Man saga certainly got my attention. Sadly this dvd lacks anything to be excited about. The subtitles are very bad, at times completely out of sync and incorrect. The music sounds like it was taken from a low budget Hollywood musical and the overly choreographed fight scenes have the same sound effects as the old Bruce Lee movies where someone is hitting a Naugahyde couch with a bat. The editing is crude and seemingly random, and there is little to no continuity to the story. Anthony Wong is always great and he has Ip Man's characteristics down, but his subtleties are overshadowed by the poor direction of this film. Herman Yau has directed some great films and he turned the world on to Anthony Wong, but here in Ip Man The Final Fight he seems to have rushed this production terribly and forgotten how to make another Wong classic.",1374278400,25,961,4.658823529411765

This movie is different from Ip Man 1 to 3, by Donnie Yen.  Ip Man friends must see and own this movie.  Another Ip Man movie........A legend is born. Ip Man is another movie to watch as well.

5742299,3,B00CV922RM,"Nowhere near as good as the previous 2 that starred Donnie Yen. But then again, this film takes many years after the last one in which now, Ip Man is old and his son is a young man that was going to college and now has a job. There are a couple of plotholes here and there that confuse you a bit and most importantly, there really wasn't a real ""final fight"" at all. Just ONE fight with the local gang leader that was anything but exciting and epic.

A bit of a let down but it wasn't a failure of a film. It kept me interested even though it lacked a bit of action and what was suppose to be the final fight turned out to be that of a random street brawl in reality.

Would not recommend buying it without you watching it first online for free somewhere. There are a couple of sites that stream this film for free, you just have to look. It's how I watched it and glad I didn't purchase it beforehand.",1422403200,,902,4.033519553072626

5742313,5,B00CV922RM,"Honestly, I felt that Ip Man: The Final Fight was one of the best movies about his life. I have seen all the Ip Man films, this one, Donnie Yens and the one with Dennis To and I absolutely loved everyone on them. Ip Man 1 and 2 had the luxury of having Donnie Yen as the main character, which made the fight scenes INCREDIBLE!!! While the story and action were truly captivating, it definitely felt like the actual character of Ip Man could have had a bit more background and character development, however that movie still remains a must see. Then came the third one, The Legend is Born: Ip Man, this one had just as good of fight scenes if not better because the main actor, Dennis To, is an actual practitioner and student of the real life son of Ip Man, Ip Chun, which gave the wing chun in the movie, more authenticity as opposed to Donnie Yen, who began studying the art for the film. This movie had much more realism in its story and portrayal of Ip Man while still keeping its intriguing film presence! Then came the forth film, The Final Fight: Ip Man, this time replacing the more common, younger portrayal of Ip Man with a more older and wiser version, played but veteran Anthony Wong. This movie didn't do as well as the previous films, however I feel as though it was a PERFECT telling of the grandmaster himself. This movie showed Ip Man for who he really was, a human, all be it, a very wise and skilled individual but still a normal man. He wasn't defeating a giant crowd of people, appearing virtually unscathed after a fight, and unstoppable to the world, he was just a talented martial artist that still went through all the same trails and tribulations as everyone else. It also showed Ip Man trying to connect with his students and pass on the legacy that he was taught before he passes away. He also had to deal with the passing of his wife, his lung issues he had from years of smoking and many more! Now having all of that while still having breath taking fight scenes, truly makes The Final Fight one of the best movies in the series and just an amazing film in general. I cant wait to see what they plan in the future and I advise everyone who enjoys either wing chun, Ip Man, kung fu films, or just all around great movies, check out The Final Fight, you might enjoy it as much as I did!",1415750400,3,2314,4.309633027522936
5742314,4,B00CV922RM,"donnie yen fans will most likely dislike this movie alot. people that did enjoy wong kar wais grandmaster will probably enjoy this one.
the sets look more like a TV show. they are really ""clean"" all the time.
the video quality has a digital TV soap look as well.

but overall its a good movie ! with some decent fighting and a good story.
anthony wong is a amzing actor !

I've seen it several times and the film doesn't stick in my head because its lacking a good character foundation to make you care. If your a martial arts fan probably look somewhere else because this is more of an action/drama genre. I love IP Man I hope if they ever decide to make another all I ask is that they don't leave us hanging like the end of 2 when Bruce Lee was introduced and never show him in the next movie! Bruce Lee is legendary you cant just tease fans, that's not right! Technical wise its great the quality is stunning but the story is horrible.

5742357,4,B00CV922RM,"Well, if your like me then you watched IP MAN and then IP MAN 2 with Donnie. Then you decided to look for more films and came across this one. I read reviews first because, well in this day and age its safer. So I was prepared for a slower/less action film but I can understand those who weren't prepared not liking it. With that being said, its a great film either way you look at it. Its by a different company and different lead actor playing IP MAN but really fits the part well. I was impressed how much the lead seemed to take over the same character style as the other two films. Going in to this movie you have to know that IP MAN is older so he isn't going to be as fast as the other films. You also have to know this film aims more towards how IP MAN handles life in general at an older age. And the struggles that come along with being older.

The film has enough fight scenes to keep it moving along, just when it gets slow some kind of  fight breaks out to carry it along. I read another review knocking the last fight scene which isn't correct. If you watch the whole film you will really enjoy the last fight scene. It had a classic feel to it and I enjoyed it just as much as the other films. The only reason I give it 4/5 is because the subtitles were really really fast. Not through the entire film but certain areas I had to keep going back to replay what was said. I have watched many subtitle films and this one was just paced too fast in certain parts. Maybe 5 or 6 times. Either way, its a great film.",1404604800,,1524,4.026402640264027

There was a strong effort to maintain consistency, but there are subtleties in the portrayal which require a shift.  This shift, I found somewhat distracting from the flow of the film.  It is certainly possible that a different studio made this ""third"" film in the Ip Man story and that might explain the use of different actors.  The dialogue is in Chinese with subtitles.",1403568000,,450,4.658227848101266

5742368,3,B00CV922RM,"This movie is more of a presentation of characters and their trials in life.  It is about 60 percent Aesop's Fables with moral lessons (Chinese version) and 40 percent Kung Fu fight movie.  It is pretty well done, with good visual presentation and sets, the acting is decent, but there is a decided lack of tension.  I certainly felt more civilized watching this than the average Kung Fu revenge-theme presentation, so perhaps there is a plus there somewhere--but other than the ending scenes, it felt kind of like a slice of an ordinary person's life (who just happened to be extraordinary).  I don't like too much, over the top violence as a rule either, but to me a movie is a way to step out of the ordinary experience, go on the wild side to some degree without worrying about getting arrested for the adventure.  For a big fan of Joy Luck Club or Steel Magnolias, this movie probably has too much violence.

The story brought several different nuances to Ip Man, giving him flaws and correctly identifying that it takes a certain kind of charter to reach that level, and they are not always the kind of people you would like to be married to.  I especially liked the way the sacred cow of Bruce Lee was knocked off the pedestal a bit (long overdue, IMHO).

Although the movie script can be improved, but this movie must be commended for what it tries to do, it tries to put the Kung Fu into a context of social and historical changing China. For this alone, this movie is worth watching.

The main character IP Man, played by Jordan Chan, was well developed in the movie, however, if you have the stereotyped conception of Kung fu movie, you may find the character lacking of romance, almost too stoic.

5742488,4,B00CV922RM,"I like the effort to be authentic in portrayal of Ip Man - the human side of an imperfect man who achieved great fame.
Most of the negative comments about this show seems to come from young viewers gung ho for more action - who have little understanding of the challenges of growing old - whether as a martial artiste or as an ordinary man. His struggle with making a living, pursuing his passion in Wing Chun, loss of his wife and catch up relationship with his son, his paramour's rejection by his disciples all make for an interesting tapestry on human existence. I will be interested to know if his unbelievable escapade in the HK boon docks is historical or just artistic license - or if his intimate relationship with the singer really began after his wife's death to preserve his honor. The strained relationship with Bruce Lee also makes an enigmatic statement. Is this film an attempt to clean up Ip Man's image and contribution to WC? I wish it is easy to know.

There is some action for those expecting it, and it's done nicely, though it should be pointed out to those expecting a fight movie, this isn't one.

5742499,3,B00CV922RM,"As he title says, Ip Man: The Final Fight (Ip Man: Jung gik yat jin) chronicles the last days of the legendary martial artist (whose students included an international star Bruce Lee), but don't expect intense combat scenes that you have seen in other Ip Man-related movies, especially those starring Donnie Yen. Set in post-war Hong Kong, The Final Fight is basically a drama about this iconic figure Ip Man (played here by Anthony Wong) with a few respectable martial arts sequences.

Directed by prolific Hong Kong filmmaker Herman Yau (known for Untold Story starring Anthony Wong), The Final Fight has an impressive cast including Gillian Chung, Jordan Chan, Eric Tsang, Anita Yuen, Zhou Chuchu, Xin Xin Xiong and Ip Chun (Ip Mans real-life son), as well as nice production design re-creating the 1950s Hong Kong streets, but as a drama it lacks focus and emotional impact.

Anita Yuen is impressive as Ip Mans wife, but her screen time is too short. The Wing Chun grandmasters brief reunion scene with Bruce Lee (though his name is not named) is at best cursory. Actor / martial artist Xin Xin Xiong, who was memorable as an assassin in Benny Chans Shaolin, is wasted.

The Final Fight sets out to be a blend of bio-pic and action film that is more about Ip Man as an aging grandmaster than as a fierce fighter. The idea is interesting but fails, although Anthony Wong delivers an authentic performance, which deserved a better script.",1386115200,2,1441,4.80241935483871

5742510,4,B00CV922RM,"Sometimes, simplicity is best.  This  must have been the philosophy behind IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT.  Whereas many martial arts films nowadays use wirework and vivid imagery to tell their stories, this film cuts right to the base roots of the subject matter and gives an action-filled movie that uses neither.  The result is a top notch action film with heart that pays great respect to the legendary Wing Chun master, Ip Man.

I don't believe this film is a continuation of Donnie Yen's characterization of Ip Man.  I think this is a stand alone series.  But regardless, it is still very good and definitely worth checking out.  In this film, Ip Man is portrayed by Anthony Wong Chau-Sang, a legendary martial arts actor that I first saw way back in 1992 in John Woo's HARD BOILED.

IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The sets are simple but effective.  And the story moves along at a nice pace.

The fight scenes are done well and very entertaining.  As I mentioned, they don't rely on a lot of wirework, but instead are point-blank rapid fire slug-fests.  My sole complaint is that there are simply not very many in the film.  More time is spent on building the circumstances around Ip Man's life in Hong Kong.

I completely understand this lack of fights, as this is a biopic of sorts, and I certainly don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing this movie.  On the contrary, I am certainly recommending this one.  But I don't want folks going into this thinking it's a nonstop action extravaganza.

IP MAN: THE FINAL FIGHT is a heck of a movie and is worth seeing if you are any kind of martial arts fan.  It hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1384128000,,1683,4.509933774834437

I was thrilled to find yet another was coming out and didn't hesitate to BUY this one instead of renting it. I'm very disappointed. There was one action scene in the whole movie that came any where near being worthy of holding the IP MAN title and the movie left me with an ill respect for IP MAN and Bruce Lee for that matter. Don't break the tribute the other films have paid to the great IP MAN and his legacy. They should have just left well enough alone. Anthony Wong did nice job as IP MAN but to me never quite embodied the spirit and spunk that was portrayed in the other films.

Sad story of how Ip Man life was tormented by poverty and loss of a loved one. Wing Chun and the ""Sticky fingers"" technique is the best over all the other martial arts hand techniques.
I think the Bruce Lee story was left out and should have been built into the story instead of some cameo by an unknown in the last of the movie. After all, Bruce Lee was the one that brought this Martial Art out into the open more than any other Asian.
Ip Man was one of the greatest Teachers I have seen. Other Sifus don't have the patience or dedication.

5742546,2,B00CV922RM,I would not buy or rent this movie. If you are use to the action packed Ip Man 1 & 2 then you will not get it with this one. I think there could have been a better story line.,1379808000,,175,3.4

5742551,4,B00CV922RM,This is not a sequel to the ip man series (with Donnie Yen). Nevertheless it is still a good movie.,1379289600,,99,4.0
5742552,2,B00CV922RM,Best IP Man character that was played was by Donnie Yen. Both of those movies they made with him was simply amazing. The fight choreography was stunning and real. Donnie Yen actually learned wing chun from the son of the real IP Man who still teaches it today in Hong Kong. I saw this trailer for this movie and omg it was awful waste of money and time. I gave it 2 stars for effort.,1379116800,,383,4.12

Great entertainment and a good story line. Rent or buy it.",1378944000,,109,4.5
5742554,2,B00CV922RM,im big fan of ip man series but i couldn't even bring myself to watch it because the quality was like a copy and paste from a bootleg torrent or something.... maybe its because of my seller... i hope to get good quality next time....,1378857600,3,233,4.2

5742556,4,B00CV922RM,It's pretty good action movie. Good actor. He fits for the role of Ip Man. I like the movie better than Grandmasters.,1378252800,,117,4.363636363636363
5742557,3,B00CV922RM,"It was good. Not as good as the first three though. Not much action or dazzling martial arts, but i like any type of kung fu movie. It`s still entertaining though,",1378252800,,163,4.290322580645161
5742558,2,B00CV922RM,Not worth it. The first 2 are much better. There seems to be no story and details from this movie don't match the other 2.,1378080000,2,122,3.92
5742559,4,B00CV922RM,"With so many ip man movies, it's hard to think this would be good. Especially since Donnie ye is not playing ip man. However, it was not bad. Enjoyed the whole movie and even watched it again the next day while my relatives came to visit.",1377561600,,238,4.195652173913044
5742560,5,B00CV922RM,"out of all 4 of the ip man movies this one is one of the best in my opinion. it takes more of a turn twards narriating more than just rolling along like a film. this movie, like the other 3 ip man movies, reflect Ip Mans character better than any wikipedia page or news article ever could. and in my opinion they can not only teach others what and who ip man was, but the fundamentals of wing chun and its characteristics that in my opinion, should be used in everyday life",1377561600,,473,4.096774193548387
5742561,3,B00CV922RM,"Let me begin by first saying that after reading the other reviews for this film on here, it sounds like the reviewers purchased very crappy copies of this film. I did not get my copy from AMAZON vendors, I purchased it at this year's Comic-Con, so I did not experience the bad-quality sound effects and poor subtitle techniques that the other reviewers describe. Having said that, onward to the film.

IP MAN: The Final Fight was fun to watch. I found the overall experience much more enjoyable than the much-talked-about ""Grandmaster"" film (which I also reviewed on here for concerned martial arts fans). I did not feel that this film was of the same quality as the two Donnie Yen productions, but I felt that it captured the spirit established in the Yen films, and worked as a suitable closing chapter in depicting the life of this martial arts figure. The plot focuses on IP Man's later years where he is dealing with health issues as well as the changing economic climate around him. We meet several of IP Man's students, and are taken into some of the dramas playing out in their lives, so the film does have some slow segments. But when the fighting comes, it is crisp and ferocious, skillful, and fast-moving. I did not feel disappointed having purchased this film. The acting from most of the supporting cast was good enough to keep me engaged until the action took place. There are thought-provoking philosophical moments, particularly when a newspaper journalist--after witnessing some of IP Man's fighting--prints an incindiary article that riles up the head of another martial arts school, who then uses the newspaper to respond directly to Ip Man, which begins a brief war of philosophies in print, leading to their eventual physical confrontation.

I felt there was enough martial arts action going on to satisfy patient fans, but you do have to wait for it. The film is not wall-to-wall action, but it is decent enough, definitely worth a look if, for no other reason, just to close out the saga of the IP Man. (And for those who may be wondering--yes, the film is very forthcoming with acknowledging IP Man's most famous student--though the great Dragon is never mentioned by name, nor is he ever glimpsed fully even when he appears in the film--but it is a much-appreciated acknowledgement.

I didn't feel this film was a waste of my cash, though I didn't pay alot where I bought it. I'd say if you can find it for $12 bucks or less, get it.",1377388800,,2459,4.713953488372093
5742562,4,B00CV922RM,This IS NOT a sequl to the IP Man 1 and 2 this is simple a spin off. He never did anything like this in his life as I am direct lineage of Yip and Donnie Yen and his best friend producer for 1 and 2 were having problems with the director but filming for YIP Man 3 is in progress.,1377302400,14,279,3.5901639344262297
5742563,1,B00CV922RM,"If you do not understand Mandarin, then do yourself a favor, and wait for the dubbed version.  The English subtitles provided in this movie were simply horrendous. I had no clue as to what was happening through the entire movie.  There were also plenty of times when there were no subtitles at all.  Although I did quite enjoy the choreography of the fight scenes, not being able to understand what was going on, and why, ruined this movie for me.  The one nice surprise was the cameo appearance.  I won't say anymore about it than that.",1377129600,3,537,4.552083333333333
8586700,3,B00CV922RM,"Good, but definitely not 'great', and non on par with Donnie Yen material in the Ip Man series. The fight scenes were few, and not fantastic, but they were good. The material considering Ip Man's wife seems to conflict with the Donnie Yen Ip Man 3. I hope Donnie Yen shaves his head and is artificially aged and does a version of GGM Ip in his later years.",1530576000,,356,4.25
