3176402,5,B00180IPRG,"This DVD is amazing. I ordered my hoop and dvd, and I cant stop moving. I can do this in the privacy of my living room and the dvd breaks down all the moves in an easy way. This dvd is not meant to be done from beginning to end in one session. You learn each step and practice, eventually you can put it all together and wahhh-laahh, you are a hooping queen (or king). Happy hooping.",1225670400,12,383,3.987012987012987
3176403,5,B00180IPRG,"Living where I do, taking an in-person hooping class just isn't an option, so this was the next best thing.  I picked this DVD over the 'HoopGirl' DVD because I'd read elsewhere that there are 'troubleshooting' sections on this DVD that cover what you're probably doing wrong (and how to fix it) if you just aren't getting the move(s).

The DVD is well-edited, I can understand the instructor easily (even if my body is sometimes slow to catch on), and the troubleshooting sections are a definite help.  My one minor quibble is that the menu could use a little more breaking down (it would be nice if I could choose which section of hip hooping that I wanted to go back to, for example), but I am still giving this DVD 5 stars because of the way the information is presented.  I hope to be giving the Level 2 DVD a try in the near future.  Can't wait!",1223078400,34,851,4.360759493670886
3176414,4,B00180IPRG,"I really like the video ""Hoopnotica"".  The instructions are easy to follow but hard to master. I'm glad I can rewind. I would recommend this video to everyone how wants to learn to hoop.",1260489600,,186,4.470588235294118
3176415,5,B00180IPRG,"One thing that I found frustrating is that the second DVD in the series was more of a workout dvd, while this was more breaking down the moves.

While I do go to a hooping class, I also want to speed up my learning curve with the hoops and I found this dvd to be a great help. Everything is broken down and explained in a clear and concise manner.",1255651200,2,347,3.9571428571428573
3176416,5,B00180IPRG,"This is a great beginner DVD for hoopdancing.  Even though I already knew hooping basics I still found this dvd helpful.  Floating is one of the moves taught on this DVD and is a move I had never saw explained elsewhere. The moves are broken down into small steps that are easy to understand and you are told to expect that some of the more complex moves take time to learn, which is helpful because you don't want to get frustrated and feel discouraged.  The troubleshooting section is very helpful too.  I have this video and the next, Beginner Level 2, and highly recommend both of them! Happy Hooping!",1255305600,3,605,4.522935779816514
3176417,5,B00180IPRG,I thought this was a fun instructional DVD.  I have learned a few hoop moves but I will never be able to do what they do with a hoop!  Fun to watch and try.  I do plan on getting the next level.  It will be interesting to see what else they try to teach.,1255046400,,254,3.6481481481481484
3176418,4,B00180IPRG,"This is a helpful DVD no doubt, but I learned how to hoop a couple of days before the DVD arrived by following some helpful videos on Google Videos. So by the time the I got the DVD, i knew how to work my 43"" hoop. Never-the-less if you are contemplating about purchasing the DVD, go ahead and buy it - it is a good one - they teach excellent techniques - but the bodies of the women in the DVD gave me a complex about mine.",1254268800,3,424,3.8850574712643677
3176419,4,B00180IPRG,"Great for a starter, except it could move a little more slowly for us beginners.",1253059200,,80,4.4
3176420,4,B00180IPRG,"I enjoyed this DVD since I am totally hooked on hula hoops right now. Its fun yet basic. Just teaches the basic moves and how to start out. I haven't yet mastered the corkscrews and I do wish the corkscrew lesson was more detailed, but this video has a good flow and I really enjoy it.",1252540800,,285,4.107142857142857
3176421,3,B00180IPRG,"I wanted to get into hooping because I thought it would be really fun, and I think super hula hoops on the wii is a great workout. I read all the reviews on hooping dvd's, and everyone said this was the best.  I purchase this and the travel hoop, and after at least ten attempts (and I do not mean I dropped it once or twice and gave up, I mean hundreds of times per attempt) I still cant do it for more than 5 seconds.  Very annoying.  All of the reviewers said they had a great troubleshooting part when you have problems, but they don't go over the basic hoop.  There has got to be a basic technique that I don't know about that they are not mentioning, or I am a COMPLETE spaz.  Who knows.  Also, the travel hoop is not at all easy to take apart, I have a few sections that will not come apart at all.",1252454400,8,805,3.968944099378882
3176422,4,B00180IPRG,"I enjoy this DVD very much and, as others note, it's especially helpful for beginners or budding intermediate hoopers.  I play the segments at a slower speed to observe the professionals' hand, arm,  and foot work; it's particularly helpful to internalize their instructions before developing unhelpful tendencies--this is especially true of the trickier moves such as the ""corkscrew.""  I also like the narrator's encouraging ""don't give up"" messages throughout.  I personally haven't understood the technique for ""floating"" and consequently could wish for more thorough instructions for that move, but I'm going to stick to it until I learn how it's done.  The DVD offers good instructions that are generally well broken-down and easy to access by chapter divisions.  If you go to the Hoopnotica website, you'll find their hoops and helpful information about the size and weight of the hoops they recommended for the program.  As others note, this is not a workout DVD, but as anyone who hoops knows, once you get going, you won't want to stop, so it does turn into a workout anyway.  I've just now purchased Christabel Zamor's 2009 book/DVD combo, ""Hooping: A Revolutionary Fitness Program,"" which is getting high ratings from users.  I look forward to that too!",1249948800,2,1264,5.1568627450980395
3176423,4,B00180IPRG,"I actually bought this DVD for my wife who is a total hoop-maniac. She was already familiar with most of the tricks from the video, so if you already have more than a basic knowledge of hooping styles and techniques you might want to consider moving directly to the level 2 DVD. For those just starting out, this introductory video has some very good music and the instruction should be just right to get you started.",1249430400,2,417,4.5
3176424,5,B00180IPRG,"I am new to hoop dancing, and I purchased both Beginner Levels 1 and 2 Hoopnotica DVDs.  These are very well organized, clear, and concise.  There is a neat trouble-shooting feature that is helpful if you can't figure out why your hoop isn't ""cooperating"".  As others have mentioned, this Level 1 DVD is NOT an exercise video, i.e., there is no dance routine to follow, it is purely an instructional DVD on hoop dance beginner level techniques.  However, the Beginner Level 2 DVD has a short 20 minute or so routine at the end of the instructional portion.  I'm looking forward to honing my hoop dancing skills.  These DVDs are a great foundation for anyone starting out... highly recommend...",1247788800,3,693,4.781512605042017
3176425,3,B00180IPRG,"I like the DVD. It was very precise and informative. I thought there was more too it. It teaches you how to do certain hula hoop moves but it doesn't have an exercise routine that goes along with it. I figured it would teach you how to do it and have a basic routine to get you started, but the whole DVD seems to be just a how to. I guess they put the exercise routines in another DVD. I would recommend buying it.",1246147200,5,415,3.9523809523809526
3176426,5,B00180IPRG,"I have been learning hoopdancing little by little and this DVD has really helped me.  It is meant to be watched first and then practiced on your own, which is important to know so you won't expect a follow-along DVD.  (I find it best to practice hoopdancing free form with some music anyways.)  The troubleshooting sections are GREAT.  They help me every time I encounter a problem.  It is slow going, but once I have mastered the techniques in this DVD, I fully intend to get the next one in the series.",1245974400,3,504,4.434782608695652
3176427,5,B00180IPRG,"This is truly a very wonderful, helpful DVD. I bought it several months ago when it was still too cold to hoop outside. You do need quite a bit of space - probably a good 10x10 area would be enough. I went to a music festival with my hoop after practicing once a week or so for a couple months, and people were amazed that I had just begun hooping! Huge compliment, and a huge endorsement for this DVD.

While this is an EXCELLENT way to begin hooping, I highly recommend going to a festival or a class where others are hooping - you will learn the most from watching others!",1245110400,2,575,4.18018018018018
3176428,5,B00180IPRG,"I luv this DVD, I only wish there were more Hoola hoop DVD's.  I first found ... a beginning level 2 DVD in a major bookstore. Upon viewing the program, I soon realized I needed beginning level 1. However, I was going have had to wait at least 10-days to hold level 1 in my hands, and let the hoop begin to melt away my waist.  What a waste of good exercise time, Thanks Amazon.  I need to use your services more often.  I fact I'm going to do just that!",1243296000,,454,3.956043956043956
3176429,5,B00180IPRG,"I was a total beginner when I bought my hoop and this dvd. I must admit when I first spun that hoop around my waist, I was really discouraged and felt it would be too hard. I felt you needed a model body to even make it work. HOW WRONG I WAS! Ive been hooping for about 12 days and not only can I keep it up, I can start walking and turning. I foresee myself being able to hip hoop and more with continued practice.

The instructions are VERY clear and the troubleshooting section at the end of every segment is a HUGE plus. They know what you could be doing wrong and let you know how to correct it.

This is my first step to getting in shape - and while it won't be the answer to everything, I can hoop for 45 minutes, get my heart rate up, mop the sweat off my brows and my boyfriend loves watching every minute of it.

Buy it! Have fun! Feel great!",1239062400,44,852,3.941860465116279

As a beginner you will not be able to just go through the whole DVD at once. It takes time and patience but it is very much worth it! Just make sure you have an adult sized hoop to begin with - the plastic kids' hoops they sell all over will be useless. If you are already proficient with waist hooping, can walk comfortably while  hooping and want an actual work-out ""The Hoopdance Workout"" by Christabel Zamor is a better choice.

3176431,3,B00180IPRG,This is a fun way to stay fit but be warned there is a technique to it.  The DVD is meant as a series of lessons not a straight through program.  And my hoop wasn't the right size I had to get hold of a 44inch hoop.  I don't think I'm going to get past beginner but the idea is to have fun with it.,1234915200,3,298,3.5538461538461537
3176432,5,B00180IPRG,"This is not a workout dvd, rather it is something that you watch, pause while you practice, then move on to the next move. It is nice to have to refer back to when I keep not getting it, but I can basically do all the moves that are taught on the dvd after three weeks of practicing. The main thing to hoop dancing is to practice and devote your time to it; the dvd can't make you better, only practice and determination can. Hooping is a wonderful cardio and toning workout, and its really hard to not be happy or having fun when hooping. I get inside my hoop and before I know it its been an hour and I am all smiles.

I knew that once I learned to lift or ""corkscrew"" that my dance would be set free. Within a combined hour, I had learned to float with both hands as well as corkscrew with fluidity and beauty.

This DVD is fun, up beat, stimulating and well organized. The girls from Hoopnotica are excellent teachers. After the entire DVD was over, I was so happy and inspired that I continued dancing and playing in my hoop until my daughter woke from her nap.

8268021,5,B00180IPRG,"I went from never being able to hoop my entire life. to in 10 minutes hooping continuously, 20 minutes moving around, 1 day in the other direction, and in 3 days I was running the whole dvd start to finish to work on improving the skills. In 1 week I could perform all of the instructional information, hooping in both directions.

This time line reflects hooping with the dvd for roughly an hour a day.",1384387200,6,403,4.373333333333333
8268022,5,B00180IPRG,"I finished this DVD about a month ago and I'm now on Hoopnotica's second DVD. The first one is very informative, most of the moves are fairly simple and easy to get with a little practice. This isn't the kind of DVD that you watch all the way through to get a workout. There's a lot of pausing going on and it took me a couple sessions to get to the end and master all the skills. Sometimes the moves in the DVD were kind of boring to me so I peppered in a few additional beginner skills from youtube tutoriala. I'm excited to go through this DVD again only in my non dominant direction as I think it will be good practice!",1380758400,,623,4.073170731707317
8268023,5,B00180IPRG,"The teacher has a calm collected way of teaching - methodical and patient for those of us that are beginners. She not only goes thru how to do the skills, but also the physics of the movements. And she encourages you to take your time and practice moves as long as you need to before moving on.",1378598400,,294,4.175438596491228
8268024,3,B00180IPRG,I like the hoopnotica tapes the best.  I am fairly new sport hooper but like the instruction levels that are used in this tape.,1377993600,,127,4.291666666666667
8268025,5,B00180IPRG,I am very pleased with this dvd.  Its very detailed and covers the basics very well.  Going to practice for a month or so and then get the second one! :),1302739200,,153,3.903225806451613
8268026,4,B00180IPRG,"This DVD is great for getting started. I had hoped for some music variety but the directions are clear. I'm working on the doable part! After reading many reviews, I got a regular hoop (no extra weight or ridges). I hooped as a child but it is much more difficult now. Even attempting to keep the hoop going is great exercise and fun. Good Luck.",1295136000,,345,4.323076923076923
8268027,4,B00180IPRG,"I like the way it's set up, very basic beginner stuff.  And simple directions easy to follow.",1284854400,,93,4.470588235294118
8268028,5,B00180IPRG,"Ok, I'm a completely uncoordinated, and it took over 2 weeks of trying and dropping the hoop more times than can be counted just to get it to hoop around my waist.  That was in December, I asked for the travel hoop for a xmas gift.  I can now fluidly do everything on this DVD and I'm now onto level 2 and slowly (just like starting all over again learning to hoop on my chest- but 2 weeks later and at least it only drops to my waste - I'm learning.)  What I like about this DVD is that it's really broken down into steps, with identification of pressure points.  The troubleshooting guide is great on the simple activities, but on the corkscrew I found it to vague.  If you can hang in there, it's really alot of fun, and I'm looking into studying so I can teach it.  Instead of a boring aerobic program, repetitive yoga, or pilates - I have to watch a DVD to remember steps.  With hooping, it's dance and I can do it 2x a day and never get bored, change the music and it helps with the creativity.  This DVD has been a great start for me - I've already ordered Level 3.  The added benefit, I haven't been loosing weight, but my pants are looser - I think it's all the hip hooping.",1265155200,5,1183,4.108695652173913
