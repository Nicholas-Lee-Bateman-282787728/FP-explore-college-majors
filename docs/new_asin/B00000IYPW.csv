3713080,5,B00000IYPW,I am a big fan of martial arts movies. I have been collecting them for sometime. The SB (Shaw Brothers) made another good one. They have a very good selection of actors and movie themes. The Shaolin Prince is a really good flick. The action and the story holds the viewer attention.,1363737600,,282,4.4423076923076925
3713081,5,B00000IYPW,"As a transfer of an old Shaw Brothers film this is an excellent product.  Yes, I know, the subtitles are not great.  The film does have a dubbed version but I can't tell you if it's any good or not because I don't watch English dubbed movies.  They are infinitely worse than poor subtitles.
Ti Lung's subtle comedic performance is great as usual.  Both Ti Lung and Derek Yee do their usual good job in the action scenes.
Comparing the martial arts work of the old movies to the new movies is like comparing apples and oranges.  It shouldn't be done and I won't.  Though  I will say I enjoy both.",1363478400,,595,4.306306306306307
3713082,5,B00000IYPW,"This is a Shaw Brother classic, and the best hands down. I watch this film as a little kid but never forgot about it.  I later found it as an adult and I'm still blown away.  Its an old school school film but it shows were all this new stuff came from.  Frankly this new stuff still cant top this film. The story of family, vengence and destiny couldn't of been better.  It introduced the 18 buddas and the infamous 3 holy fools. I wanted this film so bad I bought it on VHS and and a VCR just to watch it.  I later came back and upgraded to DVD.  Hands down this film is one of the top 5 ever made.  Shaw Brothers recently rename it Shaolin Prince for re-release under Funimation. Get THis Film!!!!!!!",1354406400,,702,4.117647058823529
3713083,4,B00000IYPW,"There are lot's of subplots in this kung fu flick. The two princes separated at birth. The Evil 9th Prince trying to hold on to his power. Treacherous and favor seeking monks. A Fire Man & Water Man. The 18 Buddha Attack! There's even an exorcism of a demon.  But the one thing that really stands out, make that 3 stand outs . . . The Three Holy Fools! If they had more scenes I'd give it Five Stars!

They aren't too bright.  But they are Kung Fu Geniuses! Just picture the 3 Stooges with no interest in anything but fighting. In fact no one at the temple is a match for them. But they've hurt some many people with their kung fu they're banished from the temple grounds for 20 years. So when one the princes show up on their doorstep they decide to raise him as a Fool and teach him the Iching Style Kung Fu.

When the other prince shows up with his Magic Sword the fun really begins.

""A Magic Sword? I reckon this could be most interesting. You'd better go see!""",1351209600,,966,4.172043010752688
3713084,5,B00000IYPW,"I found this one when I was a kid. Of course the title and the box art has zero to do with the movie, but it is still an awesome kung fu flick! I hope it is on DVD some day.",1324425600,,173,3.2439024390243905
3713085,4,B00000IYPW,this is a must buy if you are a fan of shaw brothers or old school martial arts films . the only reason i gave it four stars is that i have seen it many times before . enjoy,1290556800,2,173,3.4615384615384617
3713086,4,B00000IYPW,"The Shaw Brothers, the company known for their many releases of Hong Kong films for many decades ran by producer Sir Run Run Shaw, knighted by the British government and founder of Shaw University in Hong Kong and even founded the HK-TVB TV network was a major power behind the company and his third brother Runme Shaw (who founded South Sea Film), the film company would become known as Shaw Brothers Studio and become the first studio to bring Hong Kong cinema with sound in 1934.

The Shaw Brothers have created over a thousand films and with several having been aired on US television and some being released on video, the 1982 film""Shaolin Prince"" (Shaolin chuan ren) aka ""Iron Fingers of Death""gets its US DVD release courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment and would star popular Shaw Bros. action star Ti Lung, Derek Yee and Jason Pai Piao and would be directed by Tang Chia.

The film begins with the current emperor who has been betrayed by the 9th Lord (known as ""Iron Fingers"") who is after the royal seal in order to become the next emperor.  Before they are ambushed, the current emperor asks for his soldiers to hide his sons, one who would be the crown prince.  As the current emperor's soldiers carry other young boys to confuse Iron Fingers and his army, the race is on to hide the children and prevent them from being killed.

Eventually, the current emperor, his family and his soldiers are killed by the Iron Fingers but the young brothers are separated with the younger Wong Szu Tai living under the care of the Prime Minister (played by Ku Feng) and the eldest young brother Tao Hung who is raised by the bumbling 3 holy fools of the Shaolin Temple and are given the deceased emperor's royal seal.

The reason of why the three holy fools want to raise Tao Hung is because they have been punished and banished in the back area of the training ground and must live outside of where the other Shaolin martial artist practice.  The rule that they must abide by is that they can't step outside of their temple and because of that, the three fools look at Tao Hung as their only chance of getting anything done in the outside, especially have him bring them food from the main temple.  Also, they see it as a fun way for them to be entertained by training Tao in Shaolin martial arts.

Meanwhile, for his younger brother Wong Szu Tai, he will be raised by the prime minister and will be secretly trained in swordsmanship and martial arts.  But most importantly, he will be trained using the missing Emperor's Sword that is strong enough to fight against Iron Fingers.  As the Prime Minister and his men believe that the crown prince (Tao Hung) is dead, their only hope of defeating the evil Iron Fingers rests with Wong Szu Tai.

Fast forward to over 20 years later and Iron Fingers has a current emperor in place.  But the truth is that Iron Fingers is the puppetmaster and the current emperor is nothing but a puppet who listens to everything that Iron Fingers tells him.

Meanwhile both Tao Hung and Wong Szu Tai have become men.  Tao Hung (played by Ti Lung) has become an experienced Shaolin martial artist and has learned from the three fools and their style of Shaolin martial arts.  Meanwhile, Wong Szu Tai (played by Derek Yee) has learned to fight with the Emperor's Sword (the only sword that can withstand Iron Fingers) and martial arts but lacks the confidence.

Because the young brothers are now older and in their 20's, Iron Fingers wants to make sure they are dead and he suspects both Tao Hung and Wong Szu Tai to be the Emperor's long lost children.  Tao Hung who was raised by the three holy fools has no idea of his true lineage nor is he aware that he has a younger brother.

But one day, while trying to rid of a possessed woman of an evil spirit, Tao Hung would come across a man named Wong Szu Tai, not knowing that the man is his younger brother and both become friends and allies, not knowing that they are brothers and also not knowing that Iron Fingers and his men have targeted them for death.

Who will prevail?

VIDEO:

""Shaolin Prince"" is presented in 16:9 widescreen and for the most part, Celestial Pictures has done a wonderful job thus far in their remastering of the Shaw Bros. films and ""Shaolin Prince"" is no exception. The picture quality for this 1982 film is quite clean and in fact, the film doesn't show its age until right in the end of the film when you hear the '80s music.  But overall, this film looks great on DVD.

AUDIO:

""Shaolin Prince"" is presented in Mandarin and English mono. Mandarin is the way to go for this film as the English dub is not only cheesy but the old original English dub sounds tinny and recorded badly. In fact, you lose a lot of the crowd ambiance and the background music if you watch the English dub.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Shaolin Prince"" comes with no special features but the FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

EXTRAS:

""Shaolin Prince"" comes with a slip cover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

An action-packed martial arts comedy from the Shaw Brothers!

Unlike the bloody and violent Shaw Bros. film ""The Duel"" (which comes out on the same day as ""Shaolin Prince), this film ""Shaolin Prince"" is more comedy-driven with martial arts and even sci-fi elements.  And for Ti Lung fans, another wonderful release from FUNimation Entertainment!

But what makes this film stand out compared to other Shaw. Bros releases?  For one, the fact that the main character Tao Hung (played by Ti Lung) is being raised by three bumbling fools (who are not very smart but their martial arts is incredible), you can't help but laugh as these three Shaolin Martial Arts fools are just hilarious to watch and the fact that they are not that smart makes things quite interesting.  In fact, it's as if all three men must share one brain in order to get something accomplished.  But outside of their lack of intelligence, these men are great fighters.  And for them to train Tao Hung of their way of Shaolin martial arts is pretty cool.  But the fact that they try to find ways to trick him daily is quite interesting because it always backfires.

Obviously, Tao is much more smarter and so, it's quite fun to see how Tao tries to make their traps backfire.  As for the sci-fi element, there is a part in the film in which Tao Hung and other Shaolin monks are doing a sort of exorcist and trying to rid of the woman's evil spirit that is possessing her.  She grows nails (think X-Men's Wolverine) that can get incredibly sharp and she starts flying and disappearing all over the place.  But have no fear as the younger Wong Szu Tai has the emperor's sword which is not only unbreakable but it can emit laser like blasts.  So, what is interesting is that Wong Szu Tai has this weapon that can shoot this blast but only uses it this one time and yet he gets himself beaten up quite a few times throughout the film.  I guess the laser blast is for evil spirits only.

And of course, you have the jealous Shaolin Monk who is working with Iron Fingers to kill or embarrass Tao Hung.  He also provides some comedy support as he is constantly being usurped by Tao Hung. Then you have Iron Fingers who wears an iron glove with its index and middle finger pointing straight out and defeating all his enemies and easily snapping their swords when the sword is between the fingers.  That was quite intriguing.

Despite the sci-fi elements and humor, this is a pretty cool martial arts film as the fight choreographers were really thinking beyond the box of what they can accomplish.  Of the many Shaw Bros. films that I have watched thus far, this one really stands out because of its action and comedic scenes.

Overall, with two Shaw Bros. films coming out on August 3rd, you have the bloody violent martial arts film ""The Duel"" or the comedy/sci-fi martial arts film ""Shaolin Prince"".  Both are worth checking out and are highly entertaining martial arts films.  Check it out!",1282003200,11,7957,4.566197183098591
3713087,5,B00000IYPW,"I have been searching for this movie for over 20 years and I finally found it here. It's taken me so long because of the misleading title and the hokey cover depiction. I was brought up on this movie, and when I was a kid, I always referred to it as ""The Three Holy Fools"". My Dad was and still is obsessed with this movie. Needless to say, it got to me and my search is now finally over. I went to a search engine and just typed in ""The Three Holy Fools"" and up came this page from amazon.com. I hope everyone else will enjoy it as I have. So, Bye for now, or in Japanese...Osu!",973036800,3,579,3.9572649572649574

It's definitely action packed and the  martial arts is very good.
