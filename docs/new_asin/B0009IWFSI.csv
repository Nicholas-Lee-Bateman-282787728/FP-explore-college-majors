8061606,4,B0009IWFSI,"I would like to see a bit more before and after.  In addition, I would like to see a bit of focus on those wild flowers that only appear just after a fire and more on the plant succession following a fire.  I used this in my high school biology class during a unit on plant succession.  The Kids loved the blazing fire scenes but I would have liked more on the actual plant succession.  more on the reset mechanism of the fire rather than the mere idea of the devastation.",1418860800,,472,4.153846153846154

8061609,5,B0009IWFSI,"This tape is excellent.  It basically chronicles the story of the 1988 fires that destroyed thousands of acres of forest in Yellowstone National Park.  The cameras get right into the action along with the firefighters.  The music, narration, and editing are really first-rate.  Very well done  and worth the price of admission.  I'd like to see this on DVD...",948412800,4,359,5.0
