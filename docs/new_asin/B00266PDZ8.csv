3852439,5,B00266PDZ8,"This is by far the best police tv series ever.  Realistic cop stories each week with different stars of the 70's, not like your typical 70's cop show with the same cast of characters each week.  A&E played the episodes extensively in the 90's and I watched it again almost every chance I had.  It is finally on DVD, long overdue.  Now they need to get all the seasons on DVD.  If you like cop shows - buy this DVD, you will not be disappointed.",1310515200,20,444,4.176470588235294
3852440,5,B00266PDZ8,"This show is now being shown on Retro-TV, and all I can say is.....WOW! I was five years old when the show first aired in 1973 and I think it was shown in the 10pm slot due to some of the violence, so I only remember small bits and pieces of the show. At the time (in the 1970's) I was too young to stay up and watch most of it (much less appreciate it), but being able to watch it now and follow the storyline is unbelievable. This is hands down one of the greatest cop shows of all time.

As an example, tonight they showed the episode ""Line Of Fire"" where Jan-Michael Vincent was training and promoted to the S.W.A.T. team (his name was Hauser). Hauser was singled out and picked on, as the head of S.W.A.T. (Cameron Mitchell) continuously put Hauser in training situations where Hauser was sure to make mistakes. The episode followed Hauser home to his relationship with his very supportive wife, which I thought was a very nice touch. In the end, Hauser gets his chance to shoot a crook down. After doing so, Hauser has mixed feelings afterwards about his job to kill when required....and that is how the episode ended (as a side note, Mitchell reprises his role as a S.W.A.T. member in one episode of S.W.A.T. season one, though the characters are different [1976]).

What I have just described to you is just a small snippet of one of the many outstanding storylines of the magnificent action/drama series Police Story - a five star classic cop show with a huge variety of five star actors.",1310083200,10,1497,4.45985401459854
3852441,5,B00266PDZ8,"The most awsome 70s cop show ever made.  Its about time that they released Police Story.  I've been waiting years for this show to come out on DVD.  Most of all the show has all on my favorite Chevys, when they were brand new.  This show gives you an idea of what cops goes through, and how they handle the pressure at work and at home.  The hot prusuits are awsome, as well as action throughout the show.  I'm thrilled and honored that Shout Factory is releasing Police Story.  I also had purchased Raymond Burr's, ""Ironside,"" which was another awsome cop show.  Now, I wonder when they'll release Police Story, season two...........",1308700800,8,634,4.598214285714286
3852442,5,B00266PDZ8,"I agree one thousand percent with the preceding laudatory reviews for the TV series ""Police Story"". Cop shows have always been among my favorite TV entertainment and this was my favorite cop show of all time.

3852443,5,B00266PDZ8,Police story was one of the best tv programs from the 70's. Why hasn't it been released yet? DVD sales would go through the roof! Release it now!!! Let's go!!!,1292976000,10,159,4.333333333333333
3852444,5,B00266PDZ8,I cant't believe this show is not available for purchase on DVD these old TV shows were pure class and the actors actually had talent and the stories required viewers with an attention span longer than two minutes unlike today the TV shows of today are pure garbage! with the exception of Madmen on AMC it's true greatness! I hope there are DVD companies out there reading these reviews so they can start making Police Story available for sale. Amazon is an exceptional website for finding all of the old TV shows and movies that are available!,1292112000,8,544,4.618556701030927
3852445,5,B00266PDZ8,"This series should be appearing on some TV channel or at least DVDs should have been released. It was great TV that produced numerous excellent episodes featuring Vic Morrow and Chuck Connors in the first show in the series.

UPDATE: Five years later (September 1, 2015) and still no release of the rest of the seasons of Police Story. Some of the best episodes were in seasons 2-5 and fans of the show would surely purchase DVDs of those seasons.",1280275200,50,447,4.5875
3852446,5,B00266PDZ8,This is the best overall police procedural ever developed for television.  It spun off two other series and ran for about 100 episodes.  I am amazed this series never made it into syndication or is not currently being run on one of the cable networks.  This is one series that I will buy immediately upon its release and I am sure I speaking for a lot of others.,1262649600,86,362,4.294117647058823
3852447,5,B00266PDZ8,"Police story tv series from the seventies. This was a brilliant cop show from the seventies. Hard to believe this is not available on dvd yet.

3852448,3,B00266PDZ8,"This is one of my all time favorite t.v. shows.  And my favorite police show,  I used to watch this with my Dad who was a policeman.  It didn't have a regular cast.  Different people every week.  My favorites were Tony Lo Bianco, Don Meredith and Joe Santos.  After watching season one.  It seems like a lot of the shows were about the administrative side of the police department then policemen on patrol.  But it was good to be able to watch these shows again.  Now put the rest of the seasons on dvd.",1513900800,,503,4.26595744680851

3852451,5,B00266PDZ8,"If you do not own this and are on the fence I can only say that I feel sorry for your predicament you see I was once a being like your self not knowing only wondering and then one day I thought ahh what the heck and I ordered it and Amazon delivered it and I watched it.

Watched it? I couldn't stop watching it! Never saw this when it ran on TV but I can understand now why all of these great reviews exist on this page.

Joseph Wambaugh is all about integrity and long may he run. Putting a human face on a Policeman/Policewoman is as important a job as they come and this man Wambaugh as most know did it with honesty. These episodes are like (almost an) hour long movies and had me glued to the screen throughout.

So hesitate at your own risk, but if I were you I'd invest in this first season of Police Story as it will pay you back in entertainment dividends the likes of which we won't see again soon.",1506643200,,909,4.038888888888889

3852453,4,B00266PDZ8,Pretty OK series. Looking at lives and cases of different police officers (even one about a dirty cop). Dated story telling and certainly 70's clothing fashion but entertaining nonetheless. Lots of familiar actors. Recommended for a dose of 70's nostalgia. Political correctness has come a long way (some might say too far) from what is portrayed herein.,1502755200,,354,5.228070175438597

3852456,5,B00266PDZ8,"This was the first real rough and raw Police drama of its time, it showed the stress of the job and the human toll it could take. I watched this as a kid all the time, fantastic",1499126400,,177,3.810810810810811

3852458,5,B00266PDZ8,Used to watch this series back in the 70s and always enjoyed them. Amazing how well the stories and acting hold up even today. I purchased this set as well as pre-ordered season 2. Very enjoyable.,1498953600,,196,4.472222222222222
3852459,5,B00266PDZ8,Just what I expected the BORING TV Series from the early BADLY dressed ppl of my era ,1493337600,,85,4.0
3852460,5,B00266PDZ8,"One of the best things about growing up in the 70s was the television programs.  In my opinion, the 1970s were to television what the 1960s were to music  a tidal-wave of creativity that produced some of the most iconic shows in TV history.  Cop dramas dominated the decade and I would say POLICE STORY is the king of all cop dramas.  While Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blues were quality shows that pushed new limits, POLICE STORY paved the road for them.

One of the things that makes this show relevant, even today, is that the show depicts real police events told through the eyes of Joseph Wambaugh  a former cop and author of some of the most celebrated police-related books ever written (The Choirboys and The Onion Field).  Presented in an anthology format, each episode offers a new cop-specific experience with all new characters (on a rare occasion, an individuals character may appear again as part of another story).  I found this format completely refreshing as viewers are provided an entirely new experience each episode (new stories and new people) without the standard character sub-plots that dominate most every drama on television.

More importantly, POLICE STORY offers a realistic portrayal of police work that entertains without being indulgent.  There is a degree of honesty with the series as all episodes manage to entertain, regardless of the subject-matter, without the obvious need to embellish.  The stories themselves are varied, unique and exciting (even after almost 50 years).  An added bonus is the laundry list of classic actors/actresses that comprise a single season (Vic Morrow, Angie Dickenson, Darren McGavin, Joe Santos, etc.)  essentially a whos who of the eras big stars.

If you are looking for an exciting drama to add to your viewing list, I would highly recommend POLICE STORY  if you are a cop-drama enthusiast, it is an absolute must-own.  This show is certainly binge-worthy and has a re-watchable quality to it.  Regrettably, only the first season is available now and its only on disc.  Season 2 is scheduled to be released July 2017 (on disk as well).  While I would love to have the entire series released (in digital format), Ill take what I can get considering the pace of subsequent season releases just might extend beyond my lifetime.",1493078400,5,2293,4.955497382198953
3852461,5,B00266PDZ8,"Disappointing, however, that none of the rest of the seasons were ever brought to DVD for sale, except through ""bootleg"" sources!!",1490400000,,130,5.238095238095238
3852462,4,B00266PDZ8,I really enjoy d this dvd I wish they would have made a lot more of the series,1490227200,,78,3.388888888888889
3852463,4,B00266PDZ8,"POLICE STORY is worth watching for Pilot 'movie' ""Slow Boy"" with ex ""Rifleman"" Chuck Connors really good as the very bad guy called Slow Boy.  Vic Morrow is a take no prisoners cop (only actor to appear in 2 episodes besides old pro Scott Brady who runs 'cop' bar...) in two 2-part episodes, ""Slow Boy"" included..
The made for tv movie Big John Morrison"" (A cold, chilling Jackie Cooper...!) also stands out.
Ed Asner took a break from Lou Grant and Mary Tyler Moore to play a cop.
Martin Balsam helps to elevate the proceedings as an unorthodox cop defending himself in a 'bad shoot'.
There is some close to laughable, pseudo tough, hard boiled street dialogue from Antonio ""huggy bear"" Fargas with Bernie Hamilton in one episode.  It was almost like they were auditioning for a blaxploitation flick.
Darren McGavin (Christmas Story ; The Natural; Night stalker ... for tv) seems appropriately cast investigating ""Ripper"" styled homosexual killer that is as violent as it sounds.
Kurt Russell pops up not far removed from Disney's The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes as a ""Country Boy"" cop in training.

And I forgot how familiar and popular the theme music was.  Hadn't seen POLICE STORY Season 1 since 1975, or so, when I was no more than 7.  Not bad at all.  The authenticity certainly outweighs some 70's chinks in the police drama armor.",1487894400,9,1338,4.770562770562771

A variety of big stars played both cops and criminals giving it a more movie like quality, and Joseph Wambaugh brought his real life L.A.P.D. experience to television like no one had done before. The first season also contains an episode that would turn out to be the pilot of the successful series Police Woman with Angie Dickenson. Police Story is a great series and I hope they release the rest of it in the future.",1406592000,5,582,4.552380952380952
3852507,5,B00266PDZ8,"Joseph Wambaugh while still working for the LAPD wrote two novels,""The New Centurions"" which was turned into a movie with George C.Scott and ""The Blue Knight"" which was turned into a TV movie with William Holden. With this success he was asked to  write a series for TV which became ""Police Story"".Think of ""Dragnet"" but a lot more grittier and action-packed. This was an anthology police show where each week a different actor would appear. Stars like:
Ed Asner (Lou Grant)
George Maharis (Route 66)
Stuart Whitman (Cimarron Strip)
John Forsythe (Dynasty)
Hugh O'Brien (The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp)
and many others.
Two episodes were turned into spin-off TV Shows. Joe Forrester with Lloyd Bridges and ""The Gamble"", which is on this DVD season finale, which turned into Police Woman with Angie Dickinson. Only Earl Holliman is missing and his character Crowley is played by Bert Convy.  Holliman does show up in another episode playing another character who is a fingerprint expert. Ed Bernard and Charles Dierkop are here as Stiles and Royster whose characters would also go into ""Police Woman"".They both appear in episode 2 called ""Dangerous Games"" but the Royster character is played by another actor though Dierkop does appear briefly in the episode as another cop.
This is an excellent series and each episode makes for compelling viewing.
Bonus extra is an interview with Joseph Wambaugh.
Unfortunately, Shout Factory who released this DVD back in 2011 has no plans to produce further seasons for DVD.Now that's a crime in itself.",1405468800,9,1543,5.047058823529412

It was possibly the first show of its kind that accurately depicted police procedures while at the same time addressing the human side of the profession.  There were no regular characters (just a few recurring ones) and the stories were told in an anthology format.  It was the predecessor to shows like Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue that stressed character over story using the setting of law enforcement as the source of its drama.

forever.

  To this reader, nothing on TV has ever reached into

policing like this series. It stands alone, burnished

by the 41 years since it came out.

  The clarity of the writing and acting teams show

genius. Tony Lo Bianco, Kim Darby and Cliff

Gorman are just a few of the brilliant actors and

actresses who light up the screen here. Their

performances will pick you up and spin you

around. The music thrills you. So do the chases.

  This show convinced me to try for the LAPD, even at

an advanced age.

 When other coppers asked me, ""Hickey, how come

you don't have a TV set?"" I would tell them the

truth.

  ""When they took off 'Police Story,' I gave away my TV

set,"" I said.

3852514,5,B00266PDZ8,"The DVD has the first series of Police Story programs taken from the writings of accomplished author and L.A.P.D. Detective Joseph Wambau. The videos' are realistic and touch on the many themes officers of that day had to deal with. The story lines use era stars (early 70's) so you will see a lot of names and faces you recognize. Police Story is what got me interested in law enforcement and in becoming an officer of the law of which I retired after a 35 year career.

Some of the story lines are a little campy by today's' standards, and the cars and clothing reflect the era. However, the writing transcends all as it draws you into the story line. Well worth the money spent and brings back great memories of anxiously awaiting ""Police Story"" to come on the television. I highly recommend this first years DVD set.

Contemporary audiences will be surprised at the relative paucity of minority and women officers.

I love the anthology format in that there's constant variety.  The show never gets stale.  Season one features a superb roster of actors!  For anyone who says that the show is dated, that's what's so wonderful about it for me!!  It is a snapshot of the 70's in much the same way the excellent ""Naked City"" is a snapshot of the early 60's.  I love that! I say that as someone who was too young to watch this program during it's original run.  However, if you look past the big collars & afros, there are some tremendous stories here.

3852527,5,B00266PDZ8,I'm a retired police officer from a major metropolitan city. Many cops considered Joseph Wambaugh the top author that truly captured how it was to be a cop. The series 'Police Story' was the most accurate and realistic cop show ever made ! Each week had a different story line and characters. These varied stories truly represented how it was to be a cop then. 'Police Story' also accurately captured the interactions between the cops themselves. I highly recommend it for a good variety of excellent stories and characters. Many cops give Joseph Wambaugh high marks for his insight and humor while maintaining a true representation of police work. His more current books maintain the usual high standard of being a good read and insight into law enforcement.,1365465600,5,759,4.9375

It had many good actors some of whom went on to have their own successful series, Angie Dickerson for one. As a former L.E.O the story lines Wambaugh and of the Series writers, even after all these years still ring true today. Having met one of the people who had a character based on him in Wambaugh's book  "" The Chior Boys ""  it makes it all the more enjoyable to watch Poilce Story.

Not only is this policing in the 70's with the first widespread integration of women into patrol but also still a minority status for black officers and prejudices against hispanic officers.  LAPD is the same agency that handled the Zoot Suit Riots.  What is also appealing to non-police types is that every episode deals with the family or spouse of an officer and how the job influences the family relationship.  There are some goofs such as the roof lights are different between the long shots and close-ups when Hugh O'Brien and Sue Ann Langdon chase some guys - but this was a weekly TV show.  This does not have the authentic badges and uniforms of Dragnet or Adam-12 but has enough grit that it really does not matter if these are LAPD cops or Santa Ana or San Gabriel or whatever. I could teach a semester course based on Season 1.  You also get to visit with great actors who are gone now: Claude Akins, Lloyd Bridges and in repeat roles an amazing Don Meredith.  Love it for the cars, the fashions, the haircuts and LA as the backdrop - gas was 39.9! Listen for the theme music which gets almost no play in the opening credits and there are fast variations during chases and slow for ""off duty"" scenes but you finally get it during the closing credits.

These Wambaugh style stories seek to delve into the humanity of the cops, victims, and bad guys (played weekly by different actors). Each ending is generally very thought provoking as the action is stopped into freeze frame and the police radio babbles on in the background reminding that life and police work continues to roll ever forward.

One of the fascinating aspects of theses Season 1 episodes, is that we can watch how the program evolved into a better and better offering. In episode three Dallas QB ""Dandy"" Don Meredith is listed as one of many cast members while (his Detective partner) Tony LoBianco is the star. Quickly they were discovered to be a very entertaining tandem, and they would be brought back over and over for subsequent episodes with Meredith sharing top billing with LoBianco.

3852571,5,B00266PDZ8,"It was a truly different America in 1964 when I first became a city police officer in the SF Bay Area/California. When I retired in December 2000, things had turned nearly upside-down........not all better and not all worse......but mostly DIFFERENT! To start with the pay was under $500 a month with few benefits...and that would have been in a high-paying agency! If you had a family your wife probably had to work or you had to have a 2nd. job. There were no women officers on the street and few minorities. Gays were discriminated against and had to remain in the closet or get fired. I discovered years later that I had worked with several Gay officers....some were very competent and others were just awful....about the same as the rest of the force! You got veteran's credit for military service and being a former Marine gave you a real leg-up. In later years, military service was almost held against you (post VietNam). On a hot call, if you waited for back-up instead of doing a John Wayne solo charge, other officers branded you a coward. Today, they would brand you stupid and probably fire you if you didn't wait for cover. In 1964 I was considered a freeking LIBERAL but by 2000 I was considered the ultra conservative. I didn't change that much but the law enfrocement community value system really did. The reason I have gone into so much detail about my experience is because if you are from a more recent generation, you might not understand how really authentic Police Story is about 1970's law enforcement.  Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue were good for entertainment.....but both were somewhat extreme and really missed the mark as far as giving you the feeling of the ""been there, done that"" realism. Most people think that a police officer's job is crime prevention, writing tickets, investigating crime scenes and making arrests. Police Story reveals that much of the battle is actually contending with a broken legal system, a perfection-demanding public, one's own supervisors, internal affairs, police administrators and city government officials who are many times more interested in political correctness and self-interest than in actual public service or law enforcement. Those people are more concerned with how things look rather than how things really are. Police Story is the REAL DEAL and the honesty of the production is as relevant today as it was in the 1970's.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REST OF THE SEASONS TO BE RELEASED. Semper-Fi and ""10-7"" ""C""  ""O.D.""..........Bravo-2  Lincoln-14  Jim

3852573,5,B00266PDZ8,"Halfway through the set and already loving this series.  The stories are solid, the tone is gritty throughout, and the jam-packed guest casts are pretty amazing (including recognizable unbilled supporting players).  The extensive LA location shooting lends a lot and the show is a veritable time capsule in that regard.  It's also surprising that, while occasionally there is something dated, for the most part it holds up quite well.  Kudos to Shout! Factory for releasing this.  Hoping it does well so we can see the rest of the seasons.",1322438400,5,539,5.01123595505618
3852574,3,B00266PDZ8,"Sometimes your memory plays tricks on you, and in this case it lied. I remembered this series as being more gritty and real than other cop shows, but the first few episodes on season one disc proved to be just dated, cheesy slow-paced yawns with little action and some very bad acting. The only interesting things so far are the costumes and the low gas prices shown when the characters drive by a gas station. Maybe the rest will pick up.  After a couple of months of viewing later episodes, I find that the story lines and actors are getting better. Did we really dress like that in the 70's?",1322179200,9,594,4.4
3852575,5,B00266PDZ8,"One of the best anthology series of the 1970s. Police Story was and is in a class by itself. The guest stars are top rate, the production values are of a very high standard, the acting is above par and the stories always involving, dovetailing the Police Officers home and work life seamlessly, interspersed with realistic action sequences and an unforgettable Jerry Goldsmith score.
SHOUT Factory has done a superb job on this first season set. Uncut pristine prints including the teasers and original Screen Gems logo at the end of each episode. The sound is also perfect, especially through the surround speakers.
If you are fan of 1970s drama with familiar faces of the time then this set is for you.
I hope that SHOUT Factory releases the second season next year.",1321920000,6,768,4.7819548872180455
3852586,5,B00266PDZ8,"After 38 years, ""Police Story"" is finally released on DVD.  The pulse pounding theme music drives this series. ""Police Story"" followed in the footsteps left by ""Dragnet"" and ""Adam 12"" but it marched to the beat of its own drum.  ""Police Story"" was the father for at least two spin-off's, ""Police Woman"" and ""Joe Forrester.""  The show was ahead of its time and paved the way for ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""NYPD Blue,"" and ""Southland."" With a great cast that includes, but is not limited to Vic Morrow, Chuck Connors, Don Meredith, Tony LoBianca, Harry Guardino, Dane Clark, Don Murray, Scot Bready, Harold Duff, Claude Akins, Loyd Bridges, Ralph Meeker, Pernell Roberts, Darin McGavin, Mike Connors, Martin Milner, Angie Dickinson, Kim Darby, David Birney, and Paul Burke in several re-occurring roles, this shows police work at it's most dangerous, boring, frightening and funny. You quickly learn that the twisted sense of humor that police officers maintain is a defense mechanism. To the best of my knowledge, the episode titled ""The Wyat Earp Syndrome"" was the first time that slow motion was used in depicting what happens to a police officer in a deadly force situation.  You experience the loss of some senses and the enhancement of others as the situation unfolds. You don't know from episode to episode who is going to be appearing. One week it's SWAT action. The next, Robbery team detectives, Vice cops, Accident Investigation Division and, of course, Patrol Division. The cops are real people with their flaws, prejudices and guts. I was a rookie cop when Season 2 started. We considered this mandatory viewing for cops back in the early 1970's. I've been retired from the job for over two years now. In that time, I had not missed being a cop one time, until I watched the first episode of Season 1, ""Slow Boy."" Vic Morrow made his first appearance as Sgt. Joe La Frieda and it's a gem. I can't recommend this enough. My youngest daughter made a bunch of points with sending this to me. I had no idea that it had been released to DVD. I'll be snapping up the remaining seasons as they become available. This would be a subperb series for someone to assemble as a BOXED SET with commentaries and other special features added. Someone please take the hint. There's an awful lot of cops, active and retired, in this country who would snap this up.  Several cops I know have described police work as ""A front row seat to the greatest show on earth.""  Enjoy the ride and welcome to the show folks.",1321488000,9,2500,4.735632183908046

It was a must watch for me back then, and I enjoyed taking the time to watch the first season.  Not sure if I would recommend to anyone, but this purchase was more for me and to take me back and relive the 70's.",1320710400,5,356,3.7837837837837838

3852590,5,B00266PDZ8,"Police Story was one of the few shows I would go out of my way to see when it was originally televised.  I spent a long time on the Amazon list to be notified if and when it ever became available, and found it hard to believe it took so long to happen.  I am thoroughly enjoying the first season, and hoping Amazon will generate enough interest to make the other four seasons available.  Some shows struggle to maintain their initial quality after they have aired for a while, but this was an anthology and as such featured a lot of different actors and maintained a high level of entertainment throughout its run.  I enjoy police procedural shows, and I believe this to be extremely well done and still relevant.",1319155200,5,713,4.461538461538462
3852591,5,B00266PDZ8,Excellent! Couldn't be more pleased. So glad to see these on DVD. Been waiting a long time. Looking forward to season 2.,1318204800,4,120,4.5
3852592,5,B00266PDZ8,"I always liked this show when I was a kid(although back then some the subject matter was over my head)and since it wasn't really shown that often in syndication-I was holding out hope that Sony might release it- Low and behold, I get the Retro Tv channel out of Conneticut and start watching it and then I happen to notice that Season One was being release- I spent all my accumulated Amazon Points in buying it and that was good money spent.
 The video quality is very good,as is the audio-The episodes appear to be uncut(not syndicuts),and best of all, It hasn't been divided into two dvd sets(volume 1 & volume 2)-I get to see all my favorite 60's and 70's actors playiing cops(or robbers)-Vic Morrow,Christopher George,Chuck Connors, as well as what was essencially the Police Woman pilot starring Angie Dickinson- These are great stories about the lives of police men during and after work told realistically- Not sugar-coated. The writers give you the good,the bad and the ugly side of police enforcement-Very few if any punched pulled--The extra is a recent interview with the creator Joe Wambaugh,who detail the origins of this series- I hope that it sells well enough for further Seasons to be released --",1318204800,20,1214,4.836538461538462
3852593,5,B00266PDZ8,"The best police TV series of the 1970's. True to life showing all facets of police work warts and all! Not PC by today's standards, but trie to the period. Transfer quality is very good. Like other reviewers, I am awaiting the rest of the series. I only hope that Shout Factory has Seasons 2,3,4,& 5 are in the works.",1317686400,5,317,4.3
3852594,4,B00266PDZ8,"Creator and author Joseph Wambaugh's ""Police Story"" (Season 1) is as thrilling as I remember from watching it as a first run television series. The action is fast and realistic.  The characters are complex and their humanity shows through.  The good, the bad and the ugly of police work are presented in living color.

Gritty and certainly not PC for this day and age; the shows have a moral to their less than politically correct dialogue and story-lines.  While that may make you squirm (and I certainly did) they do serve as a reminder of how far we have come from those days of yesteryear and how far we have to go in dealing with bigotry and a host of other social issues as a society.

These shows were a glimpse into the world of law enforcement seldom seen by the casual observer prior to their airing in the early to mid-1970's.  Much of the action holds true for today's police stories.  Few writers capture life like Mr. Wambaugh and it carried through into the television series.  I cannot wait for the next season to become available.",1317513600,6,1047,4.561497326203209

3852616,5,B00266PDZ8,Outstanding/Awesome!!!! It truly reflects what it was like being a policeman/woman in the 70's.  Young or old it reflects how our law enforcement system operated then and how it has continually changed for the better.

3852617,5,B00266PDZ8,"Whenever I'm thinking about purchasing a set of DVDs, I'm always concerned about the quality of the picture and the sound, especially since I'm so spoiled by watching Blu-Ray DVDs on a high-definition TV.  Since this set of DVDs is not on Blu-Ray, I must admit that I was more than a little concerned before I ordered it.  Well, I just received the first season of Police Story this morning and I just finished watching the pilot episode and the first episode.  So, how was the quality?  Truly excellent!
In fact, I'd rate the pilot episode an ""8"" on a scale of 1 to 10, and I'd rate the quality of the first episode a true ""9"".  I loved watching Police Story back in the early 1970's when it first aired on TV.  I was thrilled to see it out now on DVD.  I'm so glad that I ordered it and I can't wait to watch the remaining 20 episodes.  Hopefully, they will produce the remaining seasons of Police Story on DVD.  There are so many awesome actors that were in this TV series, with different actors each week. Believe me, you won't be disappointed if you know anything at all about this fantastic TV series, especially if you are worried about the quality of the DVDs themselves.  Truly an excellent job of transferring this TV series to DVD.",1316736000,4,1242,4.384279475982533

After the passage of more that 35 years, the writing, acting, direction and for it's time production wear as well as it did in
real time of the 1970's. My policeman's moustache and sideburns never left; but my retro looks are white instead of black and
the fellow in the mirror is a teensy bit thicker in the waist.
This release is a wonderful example of what was best in '70's TV; and is an excellent trip in nostalgia.
These were universally considered ""training"" time for coppers at every level, and only those who would wash themselves out of the job
did not bother with them.

3852620,5,B00266PDZ8,"Wow! How great it is to see this show again. It was my favorite show in the 70's and its amazing how well the stories hold up today watching them again. I wish we could say the same for the fashion but that's part of the fun of seeing this show again after 37 years. The pilot 90 min movie, starring Vic Morrow, is just great and features Chuck Connors from the 'Rifleman' as the bad guy. All the cops in this series are smoking like a chimney's and throwing back shots of scotch at every opportunity. The stories hold up better than you'd imagine nearly 40 yrs later and the values/dilemmas of the cops and the bad guys makes this much more than just a shoot-em up show. And I can't end without mentioning the cars (the cops are driving brand new Chevy Nova's and Ford LTD's and the crooks are all driving Lincoln Town cars) and the clothes. When James Farrentino goes undercover as a 'pimp' to bust Fred Williamson, he shows up wearing a red flowered shirt open to the waist, gold chains, wide white belt holding up his high waisted polyester slacks and topped off with...wait for it..white pattent leather 'go-go boots'!!
