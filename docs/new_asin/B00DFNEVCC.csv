8592831,3,B00DFNEVCC,"This really isn't such a bad low budget horror movie, there certainly is worse out there, it has a few good ideas and is quite entertaining but its just as shame it wasn't a bigger movie! Basically the movie starts with a guy and a girl on a date, the date goes bad when on the way back to her car she gets abducted by her date as he is a serial killer who stalks young women, then we get a surprise when the tables are turned and we find out she is a killer too! A very bizarre but quite original set up, then over the course of the movie they are trying to kill each other and are kind of getting off on it, it plays out quite well with plenty of torture and blood and violence so if that's all your after then its certainly worth a watch, there is a little back story to the girl but not enough to really feel she has any motive to be what she has become, still like I said its low budget cheesy slasher horror with all the right stuff to have fun with, its just not worth going back too much! Cast is not bad, Kevin Sorbo is a decent lead for the budget I guess and the actresses are pretty hot so that's enough! Ving Rhames fans will be disappointed as its only a 2 minute cameo at the end. The ending was rather a let down too I feel, if you like a good cheap splatter movie then go for it!",1419379200,,1296,3.8943396226415095
