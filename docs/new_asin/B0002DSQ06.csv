2080541,5,B0002DSQ06,"O.K., I'm not a fan of workout videos however, purchasing this DVD was the best money I ever spent. I had read the other reviews listed and was curious. In just a few workout sessions I noticed my butt appeared to be ""lifted"". I'm a new mom with not much time to work out, but in 40 minutes I get a great cardio and lower body strength training workout.",1125273600,10,353,4.130434782608695
2080542,4,B0002DSQ06,"I ordered this DVD after reading a review about it in my Shape magazine.  The DVD starts off with a basic warmup and moves right into squats, lunges, leg lifts, etc.  At first I thought the moves did not seem too difficult but the more that you do them and then when you combine them with other moves it gets your heart going.  I did not think that I was that out of shape until two days after I did the DVD and could barely walk!  It is a great workout and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to tone up their legs and butt.",1121040000,10,529,3.9158878504672896
2080543,5,B0002DSQ06,"This is an excellent DVD for anyone, of any fitness level, desiring to firm up the lower body, specifically the glutes.  This video is very easy to follow and extremely effective.  I highly recommend the Killer Butt DVD.  It delivers everything that it promises and more!  Without question, you will see results! I love this video!!!",1120348800,8,333,4.892857142857143
2080544,5,B0002DSQ06,"I'm a college student who hasn't worked out in a few months and decieded to try some home dvds to shape up. I thought I would get the usual bounce-around aerobics,but I was dead wrong! You get a little warm-up with sprints, then its straight to the squats,lunges and plies. I couldn't finish all the routines and was sweating in about 2 minutes! I've never been worked like this by a dvd! I highly recommend this dvd for anyone that's looking for an intermediate challenge or a mix-up when regular workouts don't make you sweat.",1116028800,15,528,4.568421052631579
2080545,5,B0002DSQ06,"I do this workout about 4-5 times a week and I've had it for over two months.  During that time I've lost 7lbs just doing this workout and nothing else.  My butt and thighs look really good now.  My husband always comments on my new toned physique :)  The first time I did the video I thought it may be a little too easy, but then the next morning I could barely walk.  It took me two full days to recover and try the video again.  Now I'm addicted to it!

The workout itself is pretty boring and the music is bad, but it's easy to follow and and after doing it only a few times I just put it on my laptop next to the TV and watch TV shows while I go through the exercises.  It takes about 45 minutes and I totally break a sweat.

I have purchased other videos and I always go back to this one.  I highly recommend it.",1349827200,2,818,3.903030303030303
2080546,5,B0002DSQ06,"I really like this DVD.  It's nothing unique: mostly squats and lunges.  Still, I am someone who struggles to stay motivated so popping this in a few times a week give me a set workout.

I'm in decent shape, I run regularly. This gets my heart rate up and I can feel it in my butt and thighs.",1342051200,,292,4.0
2080547,3,B0002DSQ06,"The begining of this video has a lot of your typical lunges & squats which I find to be hard on the knees and aren't very effective for giving your buns a ""lift."" I skip to the last chapter which has some really good floor work. The host keeps me motivated. The music is kind of drab.",1317340800,2,284,4.0
2080548,5,B0002DSQ06,"I am a beginner but really trying to focus on butt/thighs. I have purchased many other videos and nothing compares to this one. It is the only one that really makes my butt feels sore aft wards, not just thigh area like most. Very excited to see results!",1304640000,3,254,4.3125
2080549,4,B0002DSQ06,"This video is definitely NOT for those who want to dance their way through a workout. Instead, this is a pretty serious lower body workout. BUT, it should be called ""killer thighs"" instead, as the thighs are the ones that will almost exclusively feel the burn. There is a good butt exercise at the end. But to target the butt with squats and lunges is harder than people think. The butt does not want to do the work and the thighs tend to take over. People who have this problem should look into glute firing, how to make their glutes do the work. It's alot about squeezing and making a connection to the butt, as well as having a proper stance. It's much harder than one would think. Anyways, this is a good video for a lower body workout, but you can expect your thighs to grow larger than your butt, unless you know what to do. Alot of squats and lunges, and some floor work.",1295049600,3,878,4.295180722891566
2080550,5,B0002DSQ06,"25 min of continuous squats and lunges followed by 20 minutes of floorwork - all targeting your butt, hips and thighs. if you pay attention to keeping your core strong while you do this workout - you will double the workout and feel that strength building daily. this workout facilitates other physical activities like hiking, running, walking the city. i LOVE that dolores is in her 40s in this video - it inspires me to keep going. the legs on her back up girl are ridiculous and also very inspiring! there will be a couple of points when you will hear ""we're going to 20!"" where you will want to throw your shoe at the tv..but just hang in there! after a couple of weeks the workout is enjoyable, but you will still sweat more than any other exercise i can think of.",1288310400,4,769,4.384615384615385
2080551,5,B0002DSQ06,"I just got this in the mail and tried it out about an hour ago - I can barely get up the stairs now! I already know I'm going to see a difference in my legs and butt by doing this video, there's really no way to mess it up. You either do the squats or you don't! And I honestly couldn't finish all of the routines because I could barely stand up after the first 15 minutes. This is a MUST for a summer beach body :)",1274054400,,415,3.727272727272727
2080552,4,B0002DSQ06,"Great Video for all fitness levels.  Just go at your own pace.  This video makes squats and lunges fun.  You can perform the exercises with or without weights.  The exercises are well paced so that one can keep good form. There is minimal emphasis on form with most of the talking being counting down the exercises.  If you already know proper form for exercising then this video is great.  There is one minor error having to do with confusing form/stance with one exercise...a different stance is used between right and left leg which leaves one confused at to which is the proper stance for the exercise.  I say this is minor because it is only one exercise calling for ten reps on each side.  Otherwise, I really enjoy the video.  I have been using it 3 times a week for 5 weeks now and I can see my legs toning up and taking a better shape.",1245628800,,844,4.358974358974359
2080553,5,B0002DSQ06,"I've been using this video for a few years.  I use it in addition to running 20-40 miles per week plus Pilates and upper body.  This is the only lower body DVD/video that actually produces visible results, so I use it from February to August.  I then switch to Erin O'Brien's full body workout, which is a great workout, too, but does not offer the same results in the legs and buttocks.  Dolores is a competent, enjoyable instructor who just gets the darned workout done in a decent amount of time.  It's challenging, and at my strongest I use it 3 or 4 times per week.  I used it before I had my first child at age 40, and it helped me get back into running shape postbaby and keep it that way for the last 3 years.  I have noticed I'm extra hungry on the days I do this workout, though!  I like my old, postbaby 'bottom' because of this video. ;-D",1238716800,5,850,4.171779141104294

2080555,5,B0002DSQ06,Great workout. I felt like I had really done a good job everytime I used it. Too bad I lost it. I guess I need to buy another one.,1231804800,,130,3.5172413793103448
2080556,5,B0002DSQ06,i bought this one after i bought killer abs and i love it just as much.  it is a great workout. it uses all of the large muscles that burn up fat.  and you get results if you stick with it. i am going to check out more of the trainer's edge dvds.,1228867200,,246,3.6226415094339623
2080557,5,B0002DSQ06,"This workout is awesome for the legs and butt, I used to do it 2x weekly before my baby and worked up to using weights- I just started it post baby and thought I would die. I know I'll be sore for a week. I also like how Munoz keeps conversation minimal, some reviewers do not think she is a good instructor, but I like the fact that she is honest and not trying to sell herself- but rather her workout.",1202342400,,403,3.9876543209876543
2080558,4,B0002DSQ06,"I love this DVD. Although it say's ""killer but"", I feel the greatest change in my legs and core. I got this DVD because I felt that my legs needed strengthening and a lot of toning since they were getting flabby. This DVD is really intense and as other reviewers have stated, its redundant. Even though this is the case, I find it really works your legs mostly and if you do the exercises at least 3 times a week, you'll definitely see results. My legs are toned and I love how my thigh muscles look - even my inner thighs! The muscles are long and strong- like a ballerina's! Can't say there's much change to my butt though - well I didn't have much to begin with anyway. I do feel an overall strengthening - in my core muscles, and arms (due to all the movement required). All in all - buy it if you want strong, ballerina legs!",1192665600,4,830,4.19375
2080559,2,B0002DSQ06,"As a pro trainer - I always watch a DVD to see if there is a progression plan for long term adherence and improvements. This is extremely important - and most exercise dvds leave this out.

The music on this one was weak - and listening to it more than 2 or 3 times gets old fast. I prefer exercise dvds to have no music - so I can choose what I'd like to play, and change it up if I wish.

If you are a beginner - this is ok to get you going in the right direction.

2080560,5,B0002DSQ06,"I very much so enjoyed the workout with Dolores Munoz. I rented it from Netflix around early March to allow my mom to try it out and to this day she has yet to return it. Perhaps I'll purchase her one for Mother's Day.

This workout is very basic with your squats, leg lifts, lunges and so forth but it is an excellent challenge to complete the entire dvd without taking any breaks. This is one that you will feel the next morning and you will see results within 4 weeks if you stick to it.

2080561,4,B0002DSQ06,"i've done this DVD twice so as of yet I haven't seen any long-term results, but I can say that this video literally kicked my butt! The moves are very basic like others have mentioned, but the circuit of exercises Munoz goes through pushed me farther than I would push myself at the gym. The only thing that bugged me is that the music playing in the background is lame and Munoz doesn't follow the rhythm of it anyway so I don't see the point. It'd be nice if I could turn the music off and work to my own tunes and Munoz' helpful tips. Totally worth the $[...]I spent.",1176595200,,570,4.1909090909090905
2080562,5,B0002DSQ06,"this is the ultimate (....) video.  i am a guy, and i do lots of non weightlifting exercise, pull ups, and push ups, and core work and all.  I was looking for a dvd that would really work my lower body and tighten up my (....)!!!  after reading through tons of customer reviews i choose this one.  ok,  everybody is not lying.  this workout made my legs turn to jelly the first time i did it.  and the funny thing,  its a easy work out.  Munoz, is so professional.  and i hate to be a guy, but her younger assistant is so HOT.  if your a guy looking for a (....) workout video that is going to keep you intrested this is the one!!!

ever week you will see a change!!!

2080563,4,B0002DSQ06,"I own this DVD and agree with some of thoughts shared by other reviewers.  It definitely has a lot of traditional and basic moves with a lot of repetitions.

These do work, but I did feel like I needed variety the next day and wouldnt be able to repeat the video 5 days in a week. Twice a week works well for me.  So on other days, I prefer the gym or a different DVD Workout

My favorite section in the DVD - Floor work!! It is a lot of repetitions and pulsing..! But works for me, I find sore legs and a tighter [...] the next day.

Something worth mentioning also:  stretching and cool down section is pretty decent, Instructor takes the time to hold the stretch and explain the importance of the move.",1164844800,5,705,4.185185185185185
2080564,5,B0002DSQ06,I read the many good reviews and decided to try this out.  I think this is an excellent workout for the lower body.  As previous reviewers have said a most of the sets are long but I think this adds to the good workout.  It also gives you time to work on form and enables you to REALLY work your muscles.  I barely made it through the first time and  am looking forward to doing it again to see if I can push myself even further.,1164585600,,429,3.941860465116279
2080565,5,B0002DSQ06,"I am an advanced exerciser, and I'd previously watched a clip of this dvd, and was intrigued, so I rented it to see if it was something that I would like to purchase and add to my collection.  It arrived two days ago and I did the routine the first night.  I must say that I love this workout!  This routine has simple, classic moves that work.  It's the intensity and repetitiveness that makes it so effective!  I appreciate Dolores's style of instruction.  I don't need the constant chatter and bantering that's found in a lot of tapes.  I agree with other posters who appreciate the fact that Dolores sweats right along with the rest of us!  That was definitely a ""plus"" for me and it inspired me to keep pushing myself.  This is one of the best workouts I've ever done! It is now a part of my weekly routine and I will be purchasing my very own copy.  I will, however, keep my rental and continue doing the tape several times a week until I receive my copy. Today is the second day that has passed after my initial workout and although I am a bit more sore than yesterday, I am looking forward to doing the tape again in a couple of days!!  This is an serious, intense, effective workout that challenges you.  I anxiously look forward to seeing the results in a few weeks!!!",1163635200,3,1278,4.323529411764706
2080566,5,B0002DSQ06,Great workout. You can REALLY feel it the next day. I found the repetativeness nice because it allows me to focus on doing the exercise properly instead of figuring out the different moves.,1160092800,,189,4.757575757575758
2080567,1,B0002DSQ06,I tried the excercises in the dvd. They aren't hard but I was very bored. This dvd went straight from the dvd player into the trash.,1155168000,,132,4.115384615384615
2080568,5,B0002DSQ06,"Great DVD. I often find that exercise videos are too difficult to follow and are therefore not effective. These moves are basic and simple and really target the butt, hips and thighs. When I don't have time to watch the whole DVD I just do an abbreviated version of the moves on my own.",1152316800,2,286,4.314814814814815
2080569,5,B0002DSQ06,"This DVD is definately a challenge, but it is worth it!  I could only do 1/2 the reps she did the first few times I did it, but it gave me something to work for.  I try to add a few reps each time I work out.  Word of advice--warm up good before AND after the workout. 5 minutes on the treadmill really made a difference in decreaseing the ""day after"" pain!",1146787200,4,357,3.9305555555555554
2080570,5,B0002DSQ06,"I have had this for a month now, using it several ways.  I complete the entire workout 1-2 a week, and use the very first section (standing portion without weights, about 10-12 minutes) as an add on to my 25-30 minute cardio vids about 3-4 times per week.  I see HUGE results in by backside and legs...  Yes, it is very repetitious but it is different than alot of the other vids out there that rush through things and stop the reps when you first begin to feel the burn.  I love the instructor, Dolores ~ you can tell she is really working with you.. I find her very motivating and strong.  I consider myself intermediate at the moment, but if you are looking to push yourself to the next level, I highly recommend!!!",1143676800,12,718,4.3283582089552235
2080571,5,B0002DSQ06,This workout will exhaust you entirely and create that burn. I can't complete the entire workout. Even doing half of the workout my legs still are sore the next day. This is really worth the money!!,1143158400,4,198,4.527777777777778
2080572,5,B0002DSQ06,"This is an excellent tool to work your thighs and butt. Yes Ms. Munoz does stick with the basic exercises, but if you're like me and find it hard to remain focused exercising on your own this tape will be helpful. In the standing segment you do squats, pulsing squats, plies, pulsing plies, forward lunges, stationary pulsing lunges and squats with kicks. However, you do more repetitions then you would do on your own so your legs start to wobble and you can really feel the workout. She gives tips on form and mostly focuses on counting, which is great because I don't like chatty instructors.

Then for the second segment which is on the floor you do bridges, with and without a leg lift, heel digs, donkeys and,etc. If you stick with this workout you will see results.

Also, if you choose Munoz's assistants show how to add weights and ankle weights to the routine. But these props are not necessary to get an effective workout. It is encouraging that the people on the DVD seem to be working as hard as you are.

I highly recommend this DVD. Keep some water nearby and good luck! :)",1137196800,29,1088,4.484848484848484
2080573,4,B0002DSQ06,"Okay, instead of ""repetitive"" some might actually call this workout ""boring"", which I probably would if it wasn't working my lower half so tough that I was screeching my teeth at various points. No, it's not gonna work your butt only - I mean, over 20 minutes of nothing but squats, plies and lounges are quite tough on your legs as well. And that is ALL you get in the standing work part of the DVD. Unless it's the first time you're making an attempt at firming your butt, you must've done all of them a million times. Doing them with Ms. Munoz, though, will make you do more repetitions than you normally would, making you work those muscles harder than usual.
Don't expect any great surprises during those more than 15 minutes of mat work either - do expect an unusual number of repetitions and quite a burn in your butt, though.

As another rewiever said, it's rather inspiring to see that Ms. Munoz and the two other ladies in the background are sweating and seem to be suffering just as much as you are. There is also a handful of useful cues, but none of those annoyingly friendly and (supposedly) funny comments you get on a lot of other home workout videos. This one is strictly about some serious lower body work - and, well, not really about fun of any kind.

There's also a bonus segment on the DVD, which took me some time to actually find out about. It's an abs/back workout with the good ol' exercises I'm sure we all have done more times than those squats. The weird thing about it is the instructor - this guy with a weird accent, a silvery patch over his right eye and a hairy armpit... He hardly ever says anything and don't expect any real cues whatsoever. I really feel like that bonus part doesn't exactly match the overall quality of the DVD.",1128124800,31,1766,4.414110429447852
2080574,5,B0002DSQ06,"I love this dvd. It really works your lower half!  The first time I did this workout I was sore for 3 days.  That's when I know its working!  Dolores does an excellent job instructing you on what to do and how to do it properly.  She reminds you regularly to do it correctly and at the level you can handle.

If you think this is a video of a series of floor exercises and will be a relatively easy workout, think again!  I worked up a really good sweat and worked hard.  The first session are all cardio exercises the second session follows up with floor exercises.

What I liked most about this DVD was that Delores is actually working with you.  She understands that she pushes you because she feels it too.  And she actually sweats!  This is the first workout video I have seen, where the instructor actually sweats.  And thank goodness!  It makes it all seem more real.

She has two other women with her doing the exercises, both of different body types: one average and one stellar.  Very motivating.

I highly recommend this video to anyone looking to trim their lower half :)",1126137600,7,1083,4.393939393939394

8026888,1,B0002DSQ06,"Did Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalin seriously consider breeding an army of ape-human hybrid super-soldiers? Of course he didn't. Stalin did have some pretty original ideas about science (Lysenkoism, anyone?) but this was not one of them. This rather trivial conclusion, however, isn't reached until the last five minutes of ""MonsterQuest: Russia's Killer Apemen"".

Before that, we are forced to watch filler about primate aggression, legends of Russian ape-men (the Almas or Almasti) interbreeding with humans, and even some footage of Trotsky and (I think) Radek. We also ""learn"" that humans and other hominids were interbreeding for millions of years before the advent of modern man. Really? Sez who?

The culprit in the human-ape hybrid scheme turns out to be one Ilya Ivanov, who was using his substantial grant of money from the Soviet authorities for somewhat unorthodox purposes. He wanted to impregnate orang-utans with human sperm, and when that didn't work out, cracked the idea that perhaps human females could be impregnated with chimpanzee sperm. The mad scientist even managed to recruit a willing subject, but he fell from grace with the Soviet regime for other reasons before the experiment could commence. (Stalin's super-soldiers were eventually equipped by more conventional methods, known as ""Lend-Lease"".) Interestingly, ""MonsterQuest"" reveals that Ivanov cooperated with the French Pasteur Institute! So who wanted to create that human-ape hybrid, really...?

This could have been an interesting program, but unfortunately ""MonsterQuest"" is as boring as usual. And, of course, sensationalist infotainment. After killing the story of Stalin's ape-soldiers, it conjures up another mystery. The Almas were supposedly interbreeding with humans. The skull of a deceased human-Almas crossbreed from Georgia have been preserved. The DNA tests on a tooth taken from the cranium turned out to be...inconclusive. Holy smoke, maybe there are human-ape hybrids after all???

Except, of course, that there are not. The documentary has already revealed that the tooth was DNA tested at an earlier occasion, and proved to be...100% human.

A bit like Stalin, I suppose.",1352505600,,2182,5.5602409638554215
