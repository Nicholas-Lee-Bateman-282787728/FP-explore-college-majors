8414204,5,B00435TOPU,"I think for any Pat Benatar lover this is the video for you! She has put together a collection of her greatest hit video's for her fans. It has my personal favorite ""Sex as a weopon"" and ""I'm gonna follow you"" not to mention her smash hit ""love is a battlefield"". I can watch ths video over and over and it will not never get boring. I recomend this to any one who loves the music of the eighties or like me a true Pat Benatar fan.",1001548800,9,431,3.9655172413793105
