2312559,5,B0009PVZBO,"For pure enjoyment and entertainment, the is the BEST one made. This is the original in the rally series.  The acting is great and diverse.  Great, funny scenes, especially several of the Chevy SS and the Porsche scenes.  The opening scenes with all the cars roaring through NYC is a classic !  It had to have been done at 5:00AM on a Sunday morning, unbelievable filming ! Get this one for pure fun and enjoyment and settle in with a bowl of popcorn.......leave the others for someone else to buy (Cannonball, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, Deathrace 2000, etc).",983404800,2,567,4.696969696969697
2312560,4,B0009PVZBO,"In 1933, legendary motorcyle rider and cross country driver Erwin G. ""Cannonball"" Baker crossed the United States from coast to coast in approximately 54 hours driving a Graham-Page Model 57 Blue Streak 8...an amazing feat of driving. Nearly, 40 years later in the early 1970's, ""Car & Driver"" magazine editor Brock Yates started the ""Cannonball Baker Sea to Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash"" in his honor. These events were the inspiration for a slew of films including the highly enjoyable, ""The Gumball Rally"", (released in 1976) and the bigger budgeted, but inferior production, ""The Cannonball Run"" (released in 1981). Both were both primarily action oriented ""car chase""comedies, however ""Gumball"" underplays it's humour with a lesser known cast, thus delivering an overall better film than the Hal Needham directed ""Cannonball Run"" By far and away ""The Gumball Rally"", is one of the best car chase films ever made with a jaw dropping collection of performance automobiles from all around the world. Car afficianado's will drool over the line up of exotic cars....an AC Shelby Cobra, Ferrari Daytona, Porsche 911, Chevy Camaro, Jaguar E-Type, GM Corvette, Kawasaki motorbike, Mercedes Roadster to name but a few. Each team seeking to out race the other's hurtling from New York to Long Beach, California.

Apart from the superb line up of cars, a fun and breezy cast really maintain the fine balance between the unique cars and the actors.

The opening sequence with the near deserted early morning streets of New York awoken by the thunder of finely tuned engines is brilliant...., as is the final showdown as the racers approach the Queen Mary in Los Angeles.

Lead actor's Raul Julia (driving the Ferrari with Tim McIntire) & Michael Sarrazin (driving the Shelby Cobra with Nicholas Pryor) shine in this comic escapade and character actor Norman Burton is wonderful as the bumbling cop, Lieutenant Roscoe trying to stop the cross country madness.

( Tragically, actor Tim McIntire died at age 42 from heart failure, possibly brought about by his alleged drug/alcohol addiction. Steven Keats (Kandinsky) died from an apparent suicide at age 49, and Normann Burton died in a car accident aged 80 ! )

It's great to finally have ""The Gumball Rally"" officially released on DVD, however it's fairly dissapointing that the disc has ""zero"" in the way of extras. Would have been nice to have some commentary from cast or crew, or some behind the scenes on the making of the film.

So buckle up your seat belts, start your engines, and hang on and enjoy pure petroleum based entertainment.......And remember the first rule of Italian driving..."" What's a-behind me is not important "".",971222400,71,2684,5.074829931972789
2312561,4,B0009PVZBO,"I think a lot of people already know how cool this movie is. it stars Michael Sarrazin, Nichlas Pryor, Gary Busey, and Raul Julia among others. Great little story of a semi-secret cross-country road race. Lots of fun!",969753600,3,217,4.7368421052631575
2312562,4,B0009PVZBO,"By far the best ""car"" flick made. Nowhere else canyou hear the unbridled song of a 427 Ford Cobra and a 12-cylenderFerrari boxer engine without the choking restrictions of modern day emission controls. The open road calls and a great adventure is afoot with some classic charactors who may or may not have anything to do with Hollywood. The cameo appearance of Linda Vaughn at the end of the film is worth the price of admission. Now that I've had the video for so many years, I love to just let it run to fill the room with the great sounds of performance engines while I work on other things - heck, I know the script by heart. I recommend this film to anyone whose looking for a well done, just plain fun movie with no political agenda or moral message to get in the way.  END",955065600,4,779,4.299319727891157
2312563,4,B0009PVZBO,"One of the best car chase, action packed, and funny movies there is. Look for Raul Julia as an Italian race car driver who loves fast cars and fast women. Some of the cars in this movie go faster than a helicopter can go.  Also watch for the NY cop who is always one step behind the racers. Watch  the women driving the Porsche, the guy on the motorcycle, and the police  car in the race from NY to Long Beach with all of the decals from each  state.

But in this one, number 2,  you can pretty much overlook most sexist situations and enjoy the wonderful chemistry between Dom Delouise and Burt Reynolds.

As I said still fun but I don't get the inclusion of Marilu Henner and Shirley MacLaine, they looked so lost in this. Keep in mind still nowhere as fun as the first but still 100X better than this Gumball Rally GARBAGE. A friend told me this was such a classic movie, I didn't see that anywhere, not funny at all and then he said it was a dramedy and I never saw the drama either. Pure garbage. Do not waste any time on Gumball. Total waste of Michael Sarrazin (I guess at the time he was big) Raul Julia who tried too hard and a young Gary Busey who was just annoying.

I'm giving this movie 5 stars because I was 8 years old when my Grandma took me to see it and it literally changed my life.

My 10-year-old granddaughter watched it for the first time with us this evening, and found it thoroughly enjoyable as well.  Based on true events, this film follows about 10 cars and their drivers on a non-sanctioned cross-country race from New York to Los Angeles.  There is comedy mixed with high speeds on public roads.  I do not advise doing this, although it is a marvelous fantasy for those who love fast cars.",1453248000,4,543,4.934065934065934

The plots are similar, but I enjoyed The Gumball Rally very much.  Many inside jokes about marques, personality types, etc., cute, not offensive.  The many ways the racers outsmart the law enforcement officer bent on arresting them are clever and entertaining.  The officer does finally arrest them all on parking violations, but they win in the end.  Highly recommend if only for the soundtrack.",1433203200,,524,5.190476190476191

The actual Cannonball only happened a few times. The first attempt - not a race, was in a  Dodge van with a huge gas tank. That set a time and general path for the eventual sea to sea trophy dash. So before this movie only a small community knew about Brock Yates, his exploits written or otherwise (automotives Hunter S. Thompson). Watch enjoy and consider two others; Two Lane Blacktop and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.

A variety of cars from new Ferrari to a 60's A C Cobra to some real classics, even a Rolls Royce. Raul Julia is hilarious
And then there is the cop that chases them across country and has been every year they have raced, The Ferrari has the factory pit crew meeting him and taking care of his car. there's a lot of comedy and just plain get there first action with some devious moves to sabotage the other guy  Well worth the money",1397865600,,593,3.941666666666667

 Not to be confused with the much later ""Cannonball Run"" movies (which are nowhere near as good) this has a lesser known group, some just not yet famous, actors but still very good. It is a comedy of sorts but it is more serious a script based off real events.
 Again just watch it for the cars and action but listen to the story line and Check Out The Cars! But the scenery from coast to coast is brilliant and the audio can be cranked up on the surround sound, to hear the echo off skyscrapers in NY City.

The movie is based on the famous Cannonball Runs sponsored by Car and Driver magazine. Filmed back when 55 was the legal limit, the movie has some great schemes to foil the cops. You can see shades of David E Davis in the Tim McIntire character and Michael Sarrazin does a fair Brock Yates. Raul Julia is great with one of my favorite lines.

2312819,5,B0009PVZBO,"This film is NOT to be taken seriously, which makes it all the more fun!  A very, very loose representation of an ""unofficial"" and outlawed 2,900 mile cross-country race that first occurred in 1971 and was documented in a car magazine.  The magazine article's author, Brock Yates, called it the Cannonball.  The Gumball Rally's zany portrayal was the first and the best of several films that ""documented"" the race.  (In my opinion, all the others are poorly realized and are not even worth mentioning here.)  Gumball's cast is excellent and they have numerous adventures out on America's highway's - some of which actually occurred in the real event.  Most of the cast did their own driving as is readily apparent in the film.  Two great scenes are 1) the start of the race with its sounds of a Cobra and a Ferrari echoing in the ""canyons"" of downtown Manhattan and 2) the high performance Camaro drifting through tree-lined curves in the mountains .

My only small complaint is the Gumball Rally was accompanied by The Cannonball Rally II as opposed to the original Cannonball Rally.
It's ok though I bought The Cannonball Rally as a separate DVD.
At less than $10 a pop you can't get a better entertainment value!

This movie (purportedly) is based on an actual ('sea-to-shining-sea') cross-country race that happened several times back in the 1970s ..... about that I could not say but ....

The 'music' produced by a V12 Ferrari going past in 'full song' is marvelous.

2312868,4,B0009PVZBO,"A New York exec is bored by a financial report and opens a gumball machine he has at his desk and decides to contact people across the country to invite them on an invitation only race.  They meet at a NYC eatery with instruction/rules, there are no rules.

Meanwhile, there is a New York City policeman (Roscoe) who intends to foil the race. Entrants consist of a fake police car, a hot rod Camaro, women in a Porsche, a Ferrari, a van full of 200 gallons of fuel so no need to stop, a Ford Cobra, a Rolls Royce, and a motor cycle.

Some of the contestants are unable to find their way out of the canyons of New York City, the engines/exhaust sound good. hard to imagine driving convertables 2900 miles at speed over 100 MPH. They leave at 6:00 AM.

Roscoe employees a helicopter to no avail, we hear CB talk like it is a secret language, a fair amount of open road driving, it appears that Castrol oil paid to appear in the movie as we see it advertised at a gas station.  At one fuel stop we see gas is .64 cents a gallon. (the movie came out in 1976)

We see a crazed motorcycle gang go after the Rolls (a scene repeated in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cannonball-Run/dp/B002N57KG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cannonball Run</a>).

2312894,5,B0009PVZBO,"This is my 3rd favorite movie of all times.  I first saw this movie when it was shown originally in 1976 at a drive-in in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  At the impressionable age of 17, I sat behind the spoked steering wheel of my 1969 MGB/GT, with buddies crammed in the car also, and I initially fell in love with this movie.

There is little I can add to the other fine reviews, except to specify that the Ferrari in the movie is no ordinary Ferrari (as if such a car existed), it is one of my all-time favorite Ferrari's, a 365 GTS/4, the spyder (convertible) version of the 365 GTB/4, unofficially known as the Ferrari Daytona.  To many of us, this Ferrari is the quintessential Colombo-designed V12 front-engine Ferrari.

And let's not forget the legendary 427 Shelby Cobra in the race, also.

This movie stereotypes and pokes good fun at the tendencies ""as a group"" of nationalities and classes of both cars, and people too.  Tongue-in-cheek, harmless good-natured fun.  Being in love with tempermental British sports cars at the time (1976), I found it very fitting that my own personal just-out-of-reach, unobtainable dream-car, the Jaguar E-Type, ... would not even start in the garage to participate in the race.

By the way, other excellent movies we motorheads who also like motorcycles will enjoy are:
#1 - On Any Sunday;
#2 - The World's Fastest Indian.

2312911,1,B0009PVZBO,"Frankly, I was expecting ""The Gumball Rally"" to be like its poster. Gayfree and funny story. It shows Brannon as lovable goofball, juggling the gumballs in the air, Alice (Susan Flanney plays her, I bet it was shock to see she was portrayed as Marilyn Monroe in the poster) in orange car behind Franco's pink car, as Marilyn Monroe-like sitting on the car door, wearing a low cut green dress and putting on her makeup. And then in Roll Royce car, a Daddy's spoiled rich woman humorously strangling a man on the motorcycle to get a leg up the competition at any cost. Sadly, the film has no humor as the poster promises. Brannon is cold filthy rich who has no feelings for anyone. His pal, Smith is too cold to root for, too. As for the women, they have few scenes. Susan and Joanne barely put their emotions in it. So I can't root for them. It seems that Susan doesn't have a driver license. They had a questionable scene. The boys chase them. One of says ""Don't do something that will get us arrested like you did last year"". Susan says ""If you can catch us, you can have us"" which Alice glares at her pal, ""That was dumb!"" because she didn't want to have anything with the boys. Their car breaks down. The next day, Alice is so upset about having a forced sex with the boys. Then they encounter two cops checking them out. They are distraugh. I can't laugh at rape story. It is questionable act on director to think it is funny????? There is no spoiled rich woman in the movie. It is Angie and her boyfriend in Roll Royce. Jose kidnaps his girlfriend, Angie. They meet a motorcycle gang who liked her bikini top too much which Angie didn't have the time to change her clothes. Jose runs over one of the motorcyles, enraging them. Joe screams they are going to kill me and rape you. Angie screams they are going to kill me and rape you. Again, it is nothing funny about murder and rape. The fake cops are in it. The writer used an old joke, borrowed from ""Candid Camera"", ""Smile you are on candid camera and you are going to be a big movie star"" punch line. The fake cops pull on the real cop and I see the punch line coming up before it starts. I heard a million jokes about it so much on TV and movies. And finally, Kapchick has probably humorous scenes in it even though not of one of them made me laugh. Seen them before. He looks insane, hapless, and accident prone, crashing into stuff. He didn't say one word until the famous scene. He utters a foul word. There were foul words, ""S"", ""A"", ""J"" and obscene gestures. There is no topless women in it. One woman scrubbed her [...] on the window and one woman mooning out the car window,inserts her fingers between her legs. Because imdb is family friendly, her act goes unmentionable.

The only way to make this movie and every movies funny to have wacky lovable characters, not cars. We can't laugh at cars or rape story.

This film captures cars that are now rare classics, back when they were nothing more than late model used cars (though desireable ones).

Without any of the amateur special effects of the era, or the modern computer generated ""action sequences"", it shows in real time and at real speeds what these great cars were capable of.  The stunt drivers rode these cars hard and put'em away wet....

Details:

-Shelby American AC427 Cobra, most likely a '67.  Running flat-out against a Daytona in the Los Angeles River Basin.
-A gorgeous Ferrari 365 GT ""Daytona"".  Ferrari guys were putting these cars on blocks even back then, so to see one run like this one is super rare.  (Miami Vice's Daytona was actually a fiberglass body kit fitted on a Corvette chassis)
-A built to the hill gen 2 Camaro driven by Gary Busey.  Peeing in a beer bottle at 80mph on a winding road, ""must see"" stuff.
-A Jag XKE, some funny cracks about British cars.
-A big block gen 3 ""bumper car"" Vette convertible.
-A 300 Series Mercedes, driven by two old WASPS from Fairfield County Connecticut.
-A 911 Porsche with 2 hot seat covers.
-A Kawasaki Mach 3, remember this hot bike? (900cc Triple TWO STROKE)
-A gen 2 Chevy Van, modified for nonstop travel.
-An early 70's Mopar fake Police Cruiser
-A Rolls Sedan and a T-Bucket Ford don't really race but are neat cars in the movie.

2312932,3,B0009PVZBO,"Although it did not feature a Dodge Charger ""The Gumball Rally"" 1976 ranks as one of the best car movies ever made due to a character named ""Ace Preston"".
Original in it's coast to coast race concept with another car movie titled ""Cannonball Run"" 1981 which also lacked a Dodge Charger and an Ace Preston, opting instead for a Dom DeLuise as Captain Chaos who later on became Captain USA, ""Cannonball Run"" should not be confused with another car movie titled ""Cannonball!!""1976 featuring David Carradine and a Dodge Charger but no Ace Preston.

What makes ""The Gumball Rally"" a classic movie is not the vehicles, like we stated earlier it did not feature a Dodge Charger but the character ""Ace Preston"" played by John Durran not to include his annoying sidekick, Gary Busey who later on resurrected his reputation as an actor in the surf classic ""Big Wednesday"" 1978 which did not feature a Dodge Charger but then again it was surfing movie and didn't need a car.

There are other great car movies without Dodge Chargers like the ""Mad Max"" series ""The Road Warrior"" 1981;
""Two-Lane Blacktop"" 1971 featured a 55' Chevy starting James Taylor(Singer/Song Writer) as ""The Driver"", Dennis Wilson(The Beach Boys) as ""The Mechanic"", and Warren Oates as ""GTO"";
""The Vanishing Point"" 1971 perhaps the greatest of all car movies didn't even feature a Dodge Charger but it's cousin a 1970 Dodge Challenger driven by Kowalski;
Then there was a Don Johnson & Nick Nolte movie called ""Return To Macon County"" 1975 with a 57' Chevy; Another Nick Nolte movie called ""The California Kid"" 1974 featured Martin Sheen driving a customized black 1934 Ford three-window coupe but whatever the movie it should include a Dodge Charger somewhere.
Some cruising and street racing movies that are great but for some reason or another are not considered car movies are ""American Graffiti"" 1973 & ""The Hollywood Knights"" 1980 somehow overshadowed by it's soundtrack/script plus considering the scenes take place during an era when the Dodge Charger wasn't even created.

Great car movies with Dodge Chargers are ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" 1974 which featured a Yellow Dodge Charger, ""Bullitt"" 1968 starring Steve McQueen and a Black Dodge Charger and then there are movies with Dodge Chargers that sucked like ""The Fast and The Furious"" 2001 and the Quentin Tarantino film ""Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof"" which featured Kurt Russell as a psychotic stuntman targeting victims from behind the wheel of his modified 1969 Dodge Charger just as David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone did in ""Death Race 2000"" 1975.  This is so wrong for a car built during an era when America landed a man on the moon and the New York Mets won the World Series but then this movie like ""King of the Mountain"" 1981 was filmed in California not New York and didn't feature Ace Preston.

Some people are misled into believing that I got the name Ace Preston from the character in the ""Gumball Rally"".  This is not true. ""Ace"" actually comes from Ace Frehley, lead guitarist from the rock band ""KISS"" whose real name is Paul Frehley.
As for my last name it comes from Captain Thomas Preston, a British Officer known for an incident called the ""Boston Massacre"", an event which led to the Boston Tea Party, and eventually the American Revolution which was made into a movie called ""Revolution"" 1985 featuring Al Pacino not to be confused with the film ""The Patriot"" 2000 starring Mel Gibson.",1188432000,,3436,4.905335628227195

2312954,5,B0009PVZBO,"I bought this to finally see The Gumball Rally, having already seen the lackluster Cannonball Run II, but the two combined for this price is quite a deal.

Cannonball 2 is worth watching for the huge starring cast and for the cars but in my opinion falls behind The Cannonball Run (1) and Speed Zone, the other two light hearted comedy films of this genre.

Gumball however, is simply the best. Sure, it doesn't have Burt Reynolds and the rest but as a car movie it comes out in first.

Gumball captures the spirit and the essence of driving, and if you are a real car enhusiast, you know what I mean. If not, you'll likely still laugh at the funny characters.

The actors did quite well, portraying memorable characters, and it's cool to see those cars (some of which are ridiculously valuable now) running like that.

It's a great cast running high speed, driving classic American Muscle and Foreign Exotics, with tops down and hair blowing all the way to the finish.

Don't judge it by it's rather lame cover. This is a real car show with REAL fast driving, not sped up cheese. Great Camera angles, great sounds, and a great experience. Admittedly none of these rather simple types of movies qualify as a truly GREAT movie, but Gumball is the best of it's kind and a genuinely enjoyable and funny film.  A simple pleasure!

You need to watch ""Vanishing Point"" , the original ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", and this movie (in this order for a great positive feeling) to hit the trifecta of really cool '70's car movies.

2312973,5,B0009PVZBO,"""The Gumball Rally"" is really a cult-classic. Overshadowed by the later Burt Reynolds ""Cannonball Run"" films, ""Gumball"" is a movie that will please any true automobile enthusiast.

Although it was filmed as a comedy, it is just so much more entertaining than the pathetic Burt Reynolds movies. There is a much, much larger focus on the cars. No sped-up footage anywhere here folks, and the fact that the cars are really being driven by the actors makes it all the more interesting. There is nothing I have seen in my entire life more satisfying than seeing and hearing the beautiful sounds of a Ferrari Daytona and an AC Cobra racing for superiority; and the camera captures it all beautifully, to boot.

As for the comedy, the movie does a far better job than I would have expected, serving up plenty of quotable one-liners, along with lots of straight car humor (the Jaguar's problem starting, for instance). The acting is actually surprisingly good as well. Michael Sarrazin nails his role as Michael Bannon, an eccentric candy company exec with a passion for speed; and the late Raul Julia convinces as Franco Bertollini, Bannon's rival, an Italian F1 ace with a passion for breasts. All of the other actors impress as well, though Sarrazin and Julia particularly impress.

This movie is the most captivating car movie I have ever seen. It's a quotable movie with great cars, great cinematography, and great acting. Now my dreams are posessed by 70's roadsters with Cibie fog lights.

2312976,4,B0009PVZBO,"In terms of films featuring illegal cross-country racing, I've always considered The Gumball Rally to be the grandpappy to all others that followed, including Cannonball (1976), The Cannonball Run (1981), Cannonball Run II (1984), and Speed Zone! (1989).  While I've enjoyed some of these other films, they were never able to reproduce that which made The Gumball Rally such a favorite within the genre, in my opinion.  Produced, co-written, and directed by Charles Bail (""CHiPs"", ""Knight Rider""), the film features a slew of actors including Michael Sarrazin (The Groundstar Conspiracy), Norman Burton (Diamonds Are Forever), Gary `Mr. Head Injury' Busey (D.C. Cab, Silver Bullet), John Durren (Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw), Tim McIntire (Brubaker, Fast-Walking), Susan Flannery (""Days of Our Lives""), J. Pat O'Malley (Alice in Wonderland), Joanne Nail (Switchblade Sisters), Nicholas Pryor (Airplane!, Risky Business), Lzaro Prez (The Mambo Kings), Tricia O'Neil (Piranha Part Two: The Spawning), and Harvey Jason (The Specialist), as Lapchick the Mad Hungarian.

Michael Sarrazin is Michael Bannon, corporate bigwig in a candy company.  As the film opens, we see Bannon in a boardroom in New York, looking, well, bored (there's probably a joke in there somewhere)...he cuts the meeting short, makes a phone call, utters a single word, ""Gumball"", which sets off a chain reaction of sorts as the word is spread to select individuals throughout the country.  The significance?  Bannon has just initiated a illegal, no-holds-barred, cross country race where the only prize is the satisfaction of being the best...that and a huge, honking trophy filled with gumballs.  Drivers come to New York from all parts (Bannon's main competition Smitty, played by McIntire, goes so far as to import a famous, Italian racer named Franco Bertollini, played by Julia), to make preparations for the race...but they're not the only ones interested, as a California police lieutenant named Roscoe (Burton) also gets wind of the competition, and arrives on the scene.  Apparently he's got a score to settle, particularly with Smitty and Bannon, the two organizers, as Roscoe's past attempts to foil the race have failed miserably.  With a revving of finely tuned engines, a squealing of tires, and the smell of burnt rubber and exhaust fumes permeating the cool, early morning air, the race begins!  Which team will take the honors of being the first to reach the Pacific Ocean in this hi-octane, cross-country free for all?  You might be surprised...or maybe not...it doesn't really matter, as the real fun is getting there...

One of the things this film has is a whole lot of boss cars including a Cobra, Ferrari, Corvette, Camaro, Porsche, Rolls Royce, Jaguar, Mercedes, and even a souped-up boogie van...I'm no motorhead, so I couldn't give you the actual models of the vehicles, but my personal favorite was the Cobra, driven by Bannon, with Smitty's Ferrari is definitely a close second.  The movie is filled with wacky characters, the wackiest being Lapchick the Mad Hungarian, the only lone participant (all the others were in teams of two) on a Kawasaki motorcycle.  He was the main comic relief in the film, generally getting into outrageous accidents, but always coming back for more, sort of like the Wile E. Coyote character in the Road Runner cartoons.  Of all the colorful characters, I think Gary Busey's was my favorite, as a member of the team driving the Camaro, the other being Ace Preston aka Mr. Guts, played by Durren, both of whom were professional stunt drivers, normally found putting on shows in the south.  I really didn't get a sense Busey had to act too hard to create his slightly psychotic `wild hillbilly' character, one that'd let out a rebel yell at the drop of a hat.  I also really liked Raul Julia as the amorous Italian driver...was he a stereotype?  Maybe, but he was still funny, and fun to watch.  Overall the story is very simple, and the characters even more so, and in another film that might be negative, but here it's all about the cars, all of which were driven by the actors themselves, and director Bail (whose primary profession was that of a stunt man) seemed to know this...I'd say probably 90% of the film is dedicated towards the display of pure, unadulterated (no sped up footage here) speed, as the cars zip towards their final destination, highlighted with stationary shots, in front of and behind shots, high above and way down low shots, and even a few trick shots.  My favorite scene in the film is right before the race starts, and all the cars are in the garage, engines revving and raring to go...there's a real, honest to goodness sense of excitement and anticipation present, something that emanates from the production naturally, rather than produced by artificial means.  Another aspect I liked was the fact there were no goofy, evil characters, bent on winning through devious means like sabotaging the other vehicles.  There was a healthy sense of competition within the group, but they felt like a tight knit bunch, the kind that would provide assistance to each other, if in need.  The `us against them' attitude was fostered strongly throughout as Lieutenant Roscoe continually tried to capture them.  All in all this is a really fun, silly, crazy movie with some generally lame, good natured gags, a whole lot of speed, and the heart to match.

Warner Brothers provides an excellent widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic transfer here.  I thought the picture was very sharp, and showed only one or two very minor blemishes.  The one disappointing element was the Dolby Digital mono audio...it did come through clearly, but it would have been cool had they re-mastered the audio in stereo given this was a racing film featuring exceptional cars, each vehicle having its own, distinct sound.  As far as special features go, there isn't much, only a theatrical trailer for the film.  I was a little surprised there wasn't more, given the influence the movie had towards future productions in a similar vein, but, at the very least, I'm happy to see this film finally released onto DVD, as the wait seemed unnecessarily long.

Cookieman108

If I learned anything from this film it's that late model Corvettes seem to have a structural weakness that causes them to split in half about mid-chassis if they take a slight jump...also, did any one else think Tricia O'Neil, who played the character of Angie, sporting an American flag bikini top, had it going on?  I think I saluted her more than once...",1128556800,31,6541,5.011080332409972
2312977,4,B0009PVZBO,"Gumball Rally was the original crosscountry race film.  After Burt Reynolds saw this film, he had Cannonball Run made.

Michael Sarrazin is the owner of a major candy company.  For fun he has an annual car rally from NYC to Long Beach (of course growing up in So Cal, they would arrive from Orange County not Santa Monica but that's just splitting hairs).

There is an assortment of drivers each with their own car (a ferrari, jaguar, kawasaki, etc.).  Of course, there is the inept police officer who tries to stop them but never can catch them.

The difference between this an the imitations is Gumbally Rally was done for the fun of it.  I would definitely buy this one over the other.

There are no DVD extras on this one but the its funny to see many up and comers in small or bit rolls from Raul Julia as the Italian racer to Don Johnson with one line as an upset motorist.

I saw it in the movie theatre when first came out in 1976 (I believe 1976). ""Cannonball Run 1"" and ""Cannonball 2"" SUCKED and were POOR when compared to this (only reason why the Cannonball Run movies made money was due to the star power in them).  Others like ""Speed Zone"" tried (that was a little better than the Cannonball Run movies), and the dramatic version ""Cannonball"" with Carradine, even tried.

All of the players: Michael Sarrazin, Nicolas Pryor, and everyone else (too many to remember) do a fabulous job with a screenplay that is written for laughs.

Harvey Jason as Lapchick, the lone eagle, is the prize of the group. Racing a Kawasaki motorcycle, he gets ""up close and personal"" with far more landscape than everyone else! (""I hope Lapchick the mad Hungarian sees that ice."")

J.Pat O'Malley and Vaughn Taylor as the elderly, experienced Team Mercedes are the best. To them this is the most fun ever. (""Andy? Did you know my wife wanted me to get rid of this car? Well, that's German machinery for you...the car outlasted her!"")

2312992,5,B0009PVZBO,"I remember seeing this first as a kid on TV then many, many times on tape.  This film started my love for the 427 Shelby Cobra.  From the beginning at the Warner Brothers intro to the end is non stop action.  Minimal plot- that's all you need-get from NY to CA.  No gotta get 50 cars or my brothere's dead or gotta deliver beer.  Just all out racing with a classic collection of cars.

  Even at the beginning with the Warner Brother's intro you get the unmistakable roar of a 427 Shelby Cobra starting up and going though the gears.  I love to hear this over ond over with the volume blasted.  Makes the house shake!  It sends chills up my spine.  And I beleive it's an original as you can see in one scene in the traffic on a CA highway the crumpled aluminum skin on the nose before they race in the riverway (like Gone in 60 Seconds with Nicholas Cage when he hits the ""Go Baby Go"" juice).  No fiberglass here!  The car action is steady thoughout the film.  When I watch the afore mentioned Gone in 60 Seconds, I just watch the Chase with Eleanor and I'm done with the movie.  This movie I can watch all the way through.

  It's pure fun racing rivalry amoung friends.  No one gets killed and minimal profanity and they all get together at the end for the reception, so I showed this to my 5 year old son who also loves cars.  (Except I skipped the scenes with Raul Julia and his lady friends, no nudity but think he's too young.)  I tried to show my son Cannonball (With James Carridine, NOT Cannonball Run with Burt Reynolds) and there was too much rivalry, fighting, and cursing.  OK for me but not my son.

  The collection of cars are great.  If I remember, there's the 427 Shelby Cobra, Ferrari Daytona Spyder (ala Miami Vice, which was a kit car Corvette.  This one I beleive is an original as you see shots of the Ferrari engine.), Porsche 911, Dodge ?Monaco? Police Interceptor, Camaro Z-28 (maybe a 1970?),  Chevy van with a 200 gallon gas tank (no stops along the way), 1950's mercedes 300 convertible, Jaguar XKE (didn't run), Rolls Royce, early '70s Corvette convertible, and last but not least, Lapchick the mad hungarian on the Suzuki mototrcycle.  I'm not sure if I left anything out.  Don't think Jackie Chan in the Subaru with night vision would've fit with this group of cars!

The audio is great.  I'm not talking the 1970's sound quality but more the opportunity to hear the cars.  The exhaust is loud and audible.  You're not just seeing cars zoom around with goofy music.  Like I said, in the beginning you get the Cobra, in the middle you get a great clip of the Z-28 speeding on mountain roads as Gary Busey is trying to pee into a bottle because his co-driver won't pull over for a pit stop.  The Ferrari sings it's tune beautifully as do the other cars.

  A great, fun, original car movie.  Light hearted, with a splash of rivalry. Definately recommended if you love cars.",1121385600,6,2903,4.391713747645951

So where, oh where, oh WHERE, is the DVD? Another reviewer said it for all of us when he quoted Raul Julia's character-defining line from the early part of the film: ""What is behind me...is not important."" And so it goes with VHS...over, behind us, end of story...Bring ON the DVD!

I must have been about 12 years old when I first watched it (I remember missing the very beginning because I had to go to the toilet and my mum told me what had happened and she said 'some man has just jumped into a swimming pool shouting ""Gumball!""'). I am now 36 years old and there was so much that as a young kid I didn't appreciate that I now do and so the film just keeps getting better. An absolute classic...",1078012800,13,576,4.106194690265487

2313023,5,B0009PVZBO,"This movie plays into the fantasies of everyone who has ever wanted to, just for a little while, chuck their respect for driving laws and do something that's a little bit crazy.  Made in 1976, just a couple of years after Congress lowered the national speed limit to 55 mph, this movie was a razzberry in Congress's face and a paean to the dreams of all drivers chafing under Federal restriction of their need to speed.

Out of the blue, you get a phone call or receive a telegram with just one word: ""GUMBALL!""  You then have 72 hours to show up at the pre-race dinner, your 'registration' as an entrant in a race with no prizes and no sanctions, that does not officially exist.

Doesn't matter who you are.  What the race's organizer (Michael Sarazin) looks for is a certain spirit, summed up by his arch-rival's (Tim McIntire) after-dinner toast: ""Here's to internal combustion, the wind in your face - and to hell with the 55 mile an hour speed limit!""

The rules:  There are no rules.  Just drive from New York to L.A. as fast as you can.

Vehicles:  whatever you want to drive. A Ferrari (with the Lothario lead driver of the Ferrari Racing Team as your co-driver), a 250CC Suzuki motorcycle (if you have a certain joie de vivre and a touch of masochism), a '55 Mercedes Gullwing convertible (suitable for declaiming speeches from Henry V while swilling brandy at 2 o'clock in the morning), a Porsche 911 (just made for highway flirtations), a Rolls-Royce (that you don't even own), it doesn't matter. Just drive from New York to L.A. as fast as you can.

Tactics:  whatever you think you can get away with, from turning a panel truck into a rolling gas tank, to disguising yourselves as cops with the appropriate uniforms and car insignia for the states you'll transit, to driving down a dry riverbed that happens to be going your way.  Just drive from New York to L.A. as fast as you can.

Of course, it isn't purely for the sport of the thing.  There is an LAPD detective named Roscoe, who has been after Bannon and Smith (the organizer and his rival) since they were rich kids racing hot rods in L.A.  Roscoe is about to be mandatorily retired, and before he goes he is determined to nail the Gumballers as his last hurrah.  He's just another hazard of the game, like bunkers, roughs and casual water on the golf course - but much more fun to frustrate.  As he's not above pulling some dirty tricks of his own, this adds spice to the race.

Not every entrant will finish, of course, and only one team can win; but sometimes it's enough to have participated in such a campaign as The Gumball Rally portrays.  This little movie is far superior to the big-budget Cannonball Run pictures it inspired, simply because it shows ordinary people doing an extraordinary (if slightly insane) thing.

Just drive from New York to L.A. as fast as you can. It makes all of us hope that we'd have the guts to respond if we ever did get that phone call or telegram with that single little word:

This movie (for those who are too young or don't remember) was promoted by giving out buy-one-ticket-get-one-free coupons that were attached to a package of 5 gumballs with cars marked on them.

Raul Julia's line (without looking, i'm sure it's already been quoted at least once in a review) is a classic.
[Incidentally, director Chuck Bail (like Hal Needham a stuntman turned director) can be seen as the on-screen stunt co-ordinator in the wonderfully strange ""The Stunt Man"").]
Beautiful cars, driven as they were meant to be driven -- flat out on real streets and roads -- and a good cast portraying interesting if not particularly three-dimensional characters, and a not-too-silly script make this one worth the watching.",989625600,12,829,5.0583941605839415
