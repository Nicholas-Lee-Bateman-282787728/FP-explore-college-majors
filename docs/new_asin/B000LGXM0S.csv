RACKET SQUAD (with Reed Hadley as Capt. Braddock) ran for three seasons on the CBS-TV network, starting in 1951. A total of 98 half-hour episodes were aired. The show's announcer/narrator was Hugh Beaumont. Guest stars on these four episodes include a former East Side Kid, TV's Lois Lane and a retired heavyweight boxer (once defeated by Joe Louis in 1941).

This is a nice sampling of early television crime drama.
