7878284,1,6304718659,I paid $2 for this... I got ripped off.  The most idiotic piece of dribble I have ever seen.  There is no story line or point.  It is a bunch of old school computer generated effects slapped together with crappy music.  Completely pointless.  It's like watching a really bad music video from 1982 that last for an hour.  It went in the trash.  The ONLY DVD I ever threw away.. and I have around 300 DVD's.,1363996800,,405,4.25
7878285,5,6304718659,"A good friend showed me this movie, and I loved it. Yes, the movie's CG are not up to todays standards, but keep in mind that it was done in the late 90's. Also found out that the movie was made in my own hometown by someone who was at the time attending community college. I could see this having aired on MTV back when it first came out.",1342828800,2,339,3.927536231884058
7878286,3,6304718659,"TELEVID (1997)
directed by Michael Boydstun

This is a video showcasing 1990s computer animation.  The director Mike Boydstun also directed some of the 'MIND'S EYE' videos.  The animation sequences were done by several different groups, and the music was produced by Scott Rockenfield of the group Queensryche and Paul Speer.

There is a very loose story here where a skeleton named ""Skully"" (done with stop-motion animation) watches television clips.  A voice from the TV threatens to get him but he continues to watch.  Each new animation sequence is a different ""channel"" that Skully is watching.  The imagery continues the psychedelic 90s techno utopian style but adds some pagan and darker themes as well.  For example there is a segment with kaleidoscopic tunnels of babies and skulls moving in rhythm.  Another part shows some kind of ritual invocation with horn-headed creatures.  Ultimately the TV voice lays out his plan in the form of rap lyrics delivered by Sir Mix-a-Lot (!).  The whole project appears to be trying to comment on fetishized media violence.

It would be unfair to judge this video by today's standards but some of the music and visuals are very dated.  It is not bad but it is sometimes uneven.  If I had to compare it with something, the first thing that comes to mind would be the old video game SEWER SHARK.",1234483200,2,1339,4.8933333333333335
7878287,2,6304718659,"Although there are some good CGI clips, TeleVoid is probably a good title for this DVD.  Not much here to get excited about.  Some bad animation work will cause diehard fans of the genre to writhe in pain.  The rock  soundtrack by Paul Speer (? ) and Scott Rockenfield of Queensryche failed  to ignite.
Best part of this DVD are at the ""bonus clips"" with  some surprisingly good surreal work from France and Japan.",953164800,,414,4.527027027027027
