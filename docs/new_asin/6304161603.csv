8079054,5,6304161603,"I have the dvd Version of Reflections of the Stylemakers,and it is a refreshingly different approach to the many Corvette Videos out there some sadly repeated and using the same Announcer in them,this one has some photos and footage seen before and a similar sounding or maybe same announcer,however the similarities end there,as you have Great Interviews throughout With Jim Palmer,Dan Gale(From The Museum,Rest in Peace,),Larry Shinoda among others. It is great Mr. Lawrence ""Larry"" Shinoda is on here,as he is famously known for His Stingray Contributions which he discusses. It doesn't leave out Ed Cole,Harley Earl and Mr. Bill Mitchell(which they keep calling Billy Mitchell?)Contribution,so it's not all about Zora. To me Engineering is great and there is no denying his contribution but He's not the father of The Vette' and Design always played a Bigger Role(thank Goodness).It includes up to the C6 Coupe of 2004.",1316908800,,923,5.285714285714286
