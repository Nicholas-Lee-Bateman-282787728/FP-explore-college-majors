5741322,5,B00CU6WBSQ,"It's great that this is releasing soon, but it's a bit pricey compared to the previous sets. Will this also get a price drop?",1376611200,6,125,4.25
5741323,5,B00CU6WBSQ,"Im gonna type a long review, so be warned, also know that I'm typing this with the assumption that a person reading this has watched parts 1-5 before this.

  Fairy Tail part 6 throws the viewer into instant action in episode 61: Super Airial Battle: Natsu vs. Cobra! This episode continues the clash that started between Natsu and Cobra that began in the last episode of part 5. I obviously won't describe details, but as most Fairy Tail fights, they do a spactacular job of mixing in humor, and serious, emotional, goosbump inflaming fights that leave you in awe afterwards. Quickly following the clash with Natsu and Cobra, Jura, and Brain brawl in a rapid showdown in order for the light guilds to obtain control of Nirvana. With Nirvana being only a few miles away from Cait Shelter at this point, The Alliance must do everything in their power to stop the last member of the Oracion Seis: Midnight. Unfortunately, everyone Except Erza, Jellal, Wendy, and Carla, are have their hands full fighting either Brain, or Cobra, leaving Only Erza and Jellal to take on Midnight. (Wendy and Carla are looking for Jellal at this point).

  Episode 64: ""Zero"" Introduces a new vicious, and unmercifull antagonist into the plot. This new problem has power that can try any Oracion Seis member. Zero, this new opponent, ravages chaos into the Alliance, almost striking down members as he pleases. With Nirvana now ready to fire, Members left behind in the North Woodsea, struggle to make it to the Fray to reinforce the battered members as the climatic battle at the end of the arc ensues. Episode 66: ""The Power of Feelings"" Is the showdown that any good arc has: Natsu goes head to head with Zero in the Light guild's LAST desperate struggle to stop Nirvana before it manages to obliterate Cait Shelter. Even Wendy joins the fray as numbers in the alliance dwindle.

  Part 6 Dosn't end with the Oracion Seis arc. When the tattered survivors of the Oracion Seis struggle make it back to the guild, rumors of a dragon sighting provoke Natsu into a trap, a fatal trap at that. Eventualy captured by the deranged scientist: Daphne, All of Fairy Tail works to reclaim their Dragon Slayer, and stop the mad scientist from unleasing a secret power that threatens to destroy Magnolia, and zap Natsu of his magic power. However, not all is as it seems between the guild members. Loyalties in this arc can be questioned: espicaly for one certain wizard.

Personally, I found this to be one of the most emotional arcs I have ever watched(Oracion Seis arc, I mean). I remember getting goosebumps in at least 14 of the 18 episodes in this arc, crying with the charecters 6 times, and screaming in cheer 16 times as I watched epic battles unfold before me. The fights are superb, and this arc I have heard, as been nicknamed, ""The Arc of memories"", because SO many charecters from season one come back into play. There isn't ONE ARC that isn't retouched with this arc. It also introduces my all time top favorite TV charecter: Wendy Marvell, who has a perfect mix of politness, awkwardness, emotion, and resolve. I highly suggest this arc for ANYONE who has seen Fairy Tail parts 1-5. Part 7 is comming out December 10th, (along with the movie) so make sure if you get these before then, that you pace yourself! I just finished episode 72 today, and now I have to wait almost a month and a half before the next part. Enjoy this show, and check out the part 6 trailer which I shall try embedding into this post. (Also please note that if you do not own a blu-ray palyer, rightstuf.com has this, and other Fairy Tail parts for normal DVD player.)

5741371,5,B00CU6WBSQ,My husband and I LOVE Fairy Tail and we can't wait to get the rest of the series. I love how they give you both Blu Ray and DVD on each collection. What I don't care about collection 6 is that there are 2 discs that only have 3 episodes which to me is a waste of space. They easily could have put more. Other than that it is a great series.,1485734400,3,340,3.736111111111111
5741372,5,B00CU6WBSQ,"After a year of waiting Funimation has finally released Collection 6! All our patience has paid off with this grand set!

Finally we get to see the conclusion to the Tenrou Island Arc something that has long been waited for. A sweet, touching, fulfilling ending to a great arc. And now we step into two new arcs that take place 7 years later. X791 arc and Key of the Starry Sky. The lost members of the Fairy Tail guild have to cope with the changes their guild has undergone with their absence.

I love the cover for this set. It has Natsu, Lucy and a character introduced in this arc. The cover suits the arc perfectly and is a nice change of pace to just having Natsu on each cover. The side had Lucy and her Celestial Spirit Loke/Leo on the side. Which suits the content of the set perfectly. Im beginning to think Natsu will be on each cover with some choice character with him. Given that he is one of the main characters this makes a lot of sense.

~

This DVD set consists of episodes 121-142, which were originally released as Fairy Tail Part 11 & 12 separately.

There are 8 discs included. Just so you know this is a DVD & Blu-ray combo pack meaning the Blu-ray is a copy of the DVD. So, in reality, it is 4 discs with four copies on Blu-ray.

As always the Blu-ray is stunning it really adds depth to the picture and you notice things not easy to catch in the DVDs. The audio is intense specifically the fight scenes and the moment when Acnologia appears of the scene is intense.

All the collection sets are worth purchasing. You get twice the amount of DVDs that part sets have at half the price. The cost is the same but buying the set is worth the price of two sets. It takes longer to be released not going to lie but Ive found it much easier to collect when I buy them in sets rather than parts. Its both Part 11 & 12 just combined into one set. Weve still got around 1 or 2 sets left until the entire collection is released besides 2014 which hopefully will also be released as collections in the future.

Funimation shines in their ability to dub the Fairy Tail series in English! I enjoy the quality the dubbing has. Funimation is able to stay true to the spirit of the manga and relies on it sometimes much heavier than the Japanese English subs. Though this is all a matter of opinion if you don't like the dub there is still the sub in this set and its also great. Theres something for everyone in this set.

The main arc of this set is entirely filler. Key of the Starry Sky is a filler takes place before Grand Magic Games.  If your familiar with fillers those are the arcs made by the anime in order to slow down the series while they wait for the manga to finish its current arc. Often these arcs have horrible characterization, bad humor or they are just boring. However, there are a rare few that actually feel like they were always apart of the series.

The following arc Key to the Starry Sky is one of those arcs. The people who produced Fairy Tail worked hard to stay true to the heart and quality of the manga and it shows. Also Hiro Mashima actually refers back to this arc quite a bit in following arcs. So even though its not actually in the manga it can be considered semi cannon. This arc basically helps Fairy Tail find a foundation after the 7 year gap and gives them time to cope with the changes. Its fun and really feels like its a part of the series.

This is an enjoyable filler that still fits perfectly with the canon manga and gives you time to see some of the lesser noticed characters shine. Absolutely worth buying and watching don't skip this arc just because its a filler trust me youll be missing out.

~

Tenrou Island Arc finishes in 2 episodes, and the focus turns to the two other Arcs this set contains:

X791 arc

Seven years have passed since the destruction of Tenrou Island and the disappearance of all the Fairy Tail members on it. Now Fairy Tail is facing a major crisis, and it could use its strongest members back.

Key of the Starry Sky arc

The core Fairy Tail members have returned, and things seem to have gone back to normal. That is until a mysterious girl drops by the guild and brings with her a strange memento from Lucy's late father. When old and new faces arise to claim this memento for themselves, Fairy Tail must literally race against time to save the world.

8586372,5,B00CU6WBSQ,"This has become one of my favorite anime series.

I know many people say that it's the same thing over and over, but I don't agree. Yeah, the guild is always on the defensive to begin with and in the end seem to come out on top, but the stories just deepen MY enjoyment on the series even farther. Even my granddaughters enjoy watching this one with me.

I've seen the entire series to date and can't wait until the next ( and supposed final season )...though if it is the final season, I will be disappointed, I can say that this is one that I will watch again and again.",1515456000,,572,4.1441441441441444
