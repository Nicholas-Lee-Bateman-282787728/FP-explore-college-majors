7000814,4,B00T5DYU1I,"Lucas (Toby Nichols) is an 11 year old boy who has been obsessed with death and filming funerals when his brother died in a hit and run accident. While filming a funeral, the lens captures a ghostly imagine which he uploads on line. It goes viral and fame follows Lucas, as his parents try to cash in. Along the way, Lucas befriends Chris Brighton (Tim Meadows) a man who was dead for 9 minutes and didn't have any kind of experience.

The theme of the film is about moving on with life. Touching, moving and funny at times. Kid safe.",1430006400,2,534,4.34

7000824,5,B00T5DYU1I,"I really enjoyed this movie. Toby Nichols did an excellent job and is a great little actor. Very touching story, although may be a bit too touching for some. I won't get into the plot but I am not too proud to admit I cried several time.",1431129600,2,237,4.0638297872340425
7000825,5,B00T5DYU1I,"It's not often that a film comes along that is equally appealing to kids and adults, but this one nails it.  Chasing Ghosts deals with a tough subject- the death of a boy's sibling, but this film is anything but morbid or scary.  It's insightful, heartwarming, funny, touching, and holds your attention from start to finish.  You may want to have a hankie handy, but most of your tears will be happy ones.  Top notch writing brings the characters to life in a way that will have you thinking about them like old friends long after the end of the film.  I think any child over the age of about eight would understand and enjoy the story.  Adults will appreciate it as a well told tale with good messages about loss, exploration, family, and growing up. Tim Meadows is just great as Chris, and the two kidlings are absolutely stars in the making.  We will be seeing them on the big screen again and again, I have no doubt.

(I won't be a verified reviewer here because I purchased the film through another venue.)",1430611200,4,1011,4.456521739130435

8700459,1,B00T5DYU1I,"When a movie is bad, I get up and leave. This movie is bad. I only got about half way through and gave up on it. If you want to watch a movie dealing with a young person and ghosts, watch The Sixth Sense; if you want to watch a movie about a young person dealing with the loss of a sibling, watch Ordinary People. Let's start with the plot: the boy has issues: we learn this in the opening scene where he is filming a roadkill like it is a police investigation of an accident, complete with miniature police yellow tape. (Is this stuff sold in a toy store?) The boy's bedroom is filled with pictures of ghosts, monsters, horror movies and everything else that one can think of regarding death. The boy attends school in a suit and tie when all other students dress...well like kids. The Boy goes to stranger's funerals so that he can film the graveyard proceedings. The boy has counseling sessions to deal with his obsessive behaviors. How does he handle these sessions: he puts his headphones on and tunes out the counselor. And how does the psychologist respond? By being frustrated. This must be her first patient.  So how do the parents help the boy? They don't. They allow all this behavior to take place. (Seriously, would you allow your 11 year old to go down and film funerals of strangers.)
Ok so at one funeral the boy films, there appears to be something (a ghost perhaps) rising from the casket. So the boy posts the video on You Tube and we are to believe that a five second clip of a mist rising from a casket on a rainy day is going to generate three million hits in three days. It is not going to happen. But then, we are to believe that a TV station gets wind on this and they want to interview the boy for the news. The parents reaction to this news: ohboy ohboy we get to be on TV. So much for helping the boy. Now they are truly feeding his obsessions and making a celebrity of him.  Now you can see why I can not finish the film. The plot is too silly to be believable. Lastly, there is nothing in the first half of this film that makes me want to root for this boy. He says nothing, he does nothing that makes you want to hope for the best for him. Just a poor screen play all around.",1462838400,,2206,4.2004716981132075
8700460,5,B00T5DYU1I,"Great story, very heartwarming. Positive family film. Interaction between Tim Meadow, Frances Conroy, Robyn Lively and Toby Nichols characters believable and excellent.",1461801600,,168,6.681818181818182
8700461,5,B00T5DYU1I,"Toby Nichols plays the part of Lucas Simons, an 11-year-old filmmaker, who is obsessed with death. His film bio says he is 4ft. 11in. tall. There is no information of date of birth. Although if he is destined to be this short he could probably be playing child parts up to his 16th birthday if his treble voice still holds out. The movie was released in 2014.",1458345600,,359,4.373134328358209

8700463,5,B00T5DYU1I,"I was surprised by this movie. I thought it would be a sappy, boring movie. Most of the time, movies like this normally flop. But I was wrong.

I loved the interaction between the boy, Lucas and Chris. The way they develop their friendship over the issue of death. Lucas is trying to find if you disappear or if you are still around after dying. It's something he has wondered about since his older brother passed away. Chris is intrigued because he himself almost died, but does not remember what happened during the minutes when he was clinically dead. But somehow, Chris is what Lucas needs. A reminder that he should keep living. That it's okay to keep living after losing someone. In turn, Lucas encourages Chris to confront his regrets.

It's just a great movie really. Check it out.",1440115200,,789,4.628571428571429
