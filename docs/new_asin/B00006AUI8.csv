Definitely a rather hodge podge collection of Elvis movie triilers, many seen elsewhere. No substance. Elvis would be sad.",1360886400,,258,4.886363636363637
7966614,4,B00006AUI8,"Essentially a compilation of trailers for many, but not all, of Elvis' post-Army films with a line or two of narration here and there. I love the period trailers, and the narration is inobtrusive if not enlightening. The sound and visual quality are good, but the color ranges from good to poor. The trailers are presented almost, but not completely, in chronological order.
