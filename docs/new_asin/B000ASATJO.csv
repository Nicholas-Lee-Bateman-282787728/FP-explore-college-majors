8079652,5,B000ASATJO,"I hadn't heard much about this but decided I would take a chance. When I watched the first two episodes I kind of rolled my eyes at the same old girl meets boy, boy has no idea girl likes him, girl is to scared to say anything. But once Nana became seven it really got interesting as she studies to get into the same high school as Yuichi. (sp) I ended up like each of the seven Nana's and even enjoyed the twist at the end. It's cute, funny, and of course you learn a little about yourself as you watch it. I give it 5 stars for being good all around.",1204761600,3,552,3.9375
8079653,4,B000ASATJO,Very cute story about Jr. High student who is accidentally split ino 7 Nanas. Each Nana is a different aspect of the original Nana. Story line is about Nana's first love and her last year in Jr high school preparing for and taking High school entrance exams.,1184630400,,258,4.51063829787234
8079654,5,B000ASATJO,"Nana Suzuki is heading toward her final year of middle school.  She has eyes for fellow student Yuichi, but can't even muster up enough courage to walk up to him.  Then, one of Nana's grandfather's inventions splits Nana into seven Nana's.  Now there's Nana and six more who each represent one of Nana's emotions outright.  The Nana's decide the only way for Nana to find happiness with Yuichi is to go to the same high school as he chooses, even though Yuichi is a top student and Nana is at the lower end of the ladder.  With a happy Nana, a crybaby Nana, a smart Nana, an aggressive Nana, a slowpoke Nana, and a Nana who's a bit weird, Nana's study habits and love life get out of control!

""Seven of Seven"" (so named because ""Nana"" in Japanese means ""Seven"", and there are seven of Nana) spans 25 episodes (and one bonus episode).  The plot holds well, but the focus of the story is on the characters.  Each episode teaches valuable lessons, which the Nana's themselves take to heart to improve who they are.

While Nana struggles with her feelings for Yuichi, there's no over-sappy love drama overtaking each episode.  Although the Nana's in time don ""Nana Ranger"" super hero costumes, and gain marvelous abilities from prisms which split into seven with Nana, there are no grand battles going on for episode after episode.  There may be strong emotions, there may be a couple of fights, but in the end it's all about the development and growth of the characters, especially Nana and her studying.  Episodes on the first DVD may be a bit slow to grab a viewer's attention, but stick with it, and by the second DVD you'll find the development of the characters and plot are well paced.  With this steady pacing throughout the series, ""Seven of Seven"" leads up to two emotional climaxes in the plot: one mid-way through the series, and the other at the end.

There's no unacceptable content for viewing by children* in ""Seven of Seven"", outside of minor drinking by a couple of adults well over forty years old.  On the other hand, the lessons learned about life and studying could surely rub off well on a child who's in middle or high school, and will eventually face mid-terms and final tests.  ""Seven of Seven"" won't be a cure-all for a studying student, but it makes for something to watch while breaking from the books.

* The bonus episode does contain objectional visual content probably for viewers under 14.  The series may be fully watched without viewing this mostly-nonsense episode which has no impact on the storyline.

The voice acting in the English dub is well done, on a level comparable with the original Japanese.  Veronica Taylor did an outstanding job voicing distinct and proper voices for each of the seven Nana's (whereas the Japanese version uses seven different voice actresses).

I have found only a few minor failings in the English version.  At at least one point, the English version's dialogue was changed from the original Japanese in a way which rendered it inaccurate for what was intended to be said, leading to it being contradicted later in the series.  Other changes were introduced whenever there was English dialogue in the Japanese version.  Such scenes are hard to translate into English, and I commend the dubbers for the job they did.  Then there was episode six, which during a classroom scene almost halfway into the episode, it sounds as if the voice actors stood across the room, their voices distant and slightly echoing.  This is unacceptable to me, and if it's on all copies of the DVD, it should have been fixed before releasing the complete series DVD pack.

With emotion-provoking twists and turns in the plot, and a large cast of interesting and lovable characters, ""Seven of Seven"" stands out as a series for viewers looking for a character-based, no matter their age, and the bright colors and cheerful settings should hold the attention of the kids, as well.

I was initially unsure about the series, a little reluctant about purchasing it, but I'm glad I bought it.  ""Seven of Seven"" is a more than welcome addition to my small-but-growing anime collection, and is certainly a five-star series.",1154563200,27,4158,4.752089136490251
8079655,5,B000ASATJO,"First of all this is a great anime for those of you who want to take break from the very mature animes with all the cussing, gore, and other content.  The story is great, very shocking and good morals to think about. My mom loved it and, she hardly ever sees any anime her type, and even my little sister, who is three. One of the reasons why I bought this was because of a preview I saw.  I liked the fact that they could turn into super heroes some how and it looked kind of interesting.  Oh and they were even nice enough to include a bonus show where everything goes crazy.  This was most likly cut out from the rest of the episodes because of its fanservice ^-^'.  Other than that bonus episode the whole series is pretty wholesome for even kids to watch.  Over all its funny, has suprising action at times, and makes you want to cheer Nana on,the main character, with her mission to pass the exams and end up in the same high school as her crush, even if she gets distacted at times with her six other selves.",1142985600,9,1015,4.17948717948718
8079656,5,B000ASATJO,"I just bought this series at Best Buy a few days ago and finished it today.  After being into Anime for just over a year, I've seen some that are quite popular and those that are almost unknown.  Nana 7 of 7 is one of those relatively unknown shows.  This Anime is about this girl named Nana who is currently living with her grandfather.  She has a crush on this boy at school named Yuichi.  Her grandfather however is a scientist.  At the very first episode, we find that he has reconfigured the microwave into a machine so he can research on a way that he could physically capture a rainbow.  As crasy as that sounds.  Nana ends up going down into the basement where her grandfather works on his various inventions.  But to make a long story short, she unintentionaly splits herself into 7 Nanas(curtousy of the messed up microwave).  There's now a grumpy Nana, a happy Nana, a crybaby, a slowpoke, a brainie Nana, and one who's just strange in addition to the original Nana.  Throughout the rest of this show, we get to see how Nana deals with this new development and how she tries to keep this a secret from everyone(with the exception of her grandfather and her best friend Hitomi who were witnesses to the split up).  There are a bunch of surprises in this show and I'm not going to give anything more away.  However, if you want to try something new and are not afraid to do so, then I highly recommend that you see this Anime.  I bought it for just over $30 at Best Buy so its not pricy in the slightest. Also, just with most other Anime that I've seen so far, Nana 7 of 7 has pretty good replay value.  Well, good luck in this experience everyone.",1139184000,8,1657,4.334415584415584
