3454947,5,B001AMSG1M,"I have a mild disability which effects my legs and my balance, so I purchased this DVD so that I could still do some yoga. I like yoga for stretching and meditation. This DVD did  not disappoint me at all.

Unlike some other DVDs, Ann doesn't JUST have you moving your arms around. She has you position yourself on the edge of the seat, so you can still move and stretch your legs. She also shows alternatives for those who can't move as easily.

After completing this DVD, I feel more calm and centered, and my flexibility is improving. It's also worth noting that the natural setting, the photography and the music in here are quite outstanding.",1247443200,45,647,4.512820512820513
3454948,2,B001AMSG1M,"I purchased this DVD based on the reviews, in hope of finding a good product for someone with heart problems. However, as the DVD does have some more rigorous movements towards the end of the practice, it was not suitable. I gave it to an expectant mother, whom I think this might be more suitable for.",1233273600,6,302,4.410714285714286
3454949,5,B001AMSG1M,"I love ,love love this DVD. For people that cannot get off the floor once down there this is the perfect exercise tape. The music is soothing. The moves are slow and relaxing. The stretches make you feel like a million $.It is part of my daily routine. I look forward to excercising and I never liked it before now.",1229904000,24,315,4.266666666666667
3454950,5,B001AMSG1M,"I have wanted to try yoga for years, but when I tried it, my feet hurt too much.  Now I can benefit from yoga without the foot trouble!  I love how I feel when I am finished.  Tension in the back is reduced.  The voice of the instructor is so soothing it is easy to relax and breath.  I can't wait for my next session!",1213747200,13,318,3.830769230769231
3454951,5,B001AMSG1M,"This DVD is a wonderful, basic, gentle yoga practice that never requires you to leave your chair.  The music is lovely and uplifting.  The practice is nice and short (25 minutes) so I didn't feel like I had to spend my whole day on it.  I felt like my circulation increased and that I could breathe easier.  I felt calmer and more relaxed.  My muscles definitely felt stretched and used, which was really nice.

I would recommend having another chair really close to you, and having a sticky mat to sit on.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a calming yoga practice which would not require you to stand at all!",1212710400,7,626,4.43859649122807
8278080,2,B001AMSG1M,I have found better examples of chair yoga on youtube - the girl showing the moves is facing you and goes way too fast.  Almost impossible to figure out the position you should be in before she goes to another one.  I watched it once and probably won't again.,1354492800,,259,4.26530612244898
8278081,1,B001AMSG1M,"I really don't understand the great reviews.  This DVD is extremely short (25 minutes including an introduction) and poorly executed.  Instructions are lacking or ill-timed.  Copying the poses, therefore, is not easy because you constantly feel the need to check the screen as there are very few instructions beyond paying attention to your breathing.  Having to add another chair for an exercise disrupted flow and was awkward in my small space.  Amazon sells many DVD's on chair yoga that are much, much better.  Just a few examples are: Angelena's Yoga, Using A Chair, Lakshmi Voelker and Susan Tuttle.  This DVD, although pleasantly filmed, does not show the modifications I need in order to participate.  All in all a very disappointing purchase.  Definitely do not recommend!",1337990400,3,781,5.184
8278082,1,B001AMSG1M,this is the most boring DVD I have ever seen-I guess it would be good if you wanted to play it while going to sleep.  extremely slow and repetitious.  My bad for buying it!,1327363200,,172,4.029411764705882
8278083,5,B001AMSG1M,Excellent for older people or people who have mobility issues. It's extremely well done and provides many of the benefits of typical yoga. The tape is about 30 minutes long so it's easy to fit it in to your day. I highly recommend it.,1304467200,,234,4.340909090909091
8278084,3,B001AMSG1M,"Chair Yoga is a beautiful, peaceful, relaxing DVD. I am a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patient. Most of my disability is in my legs, therefore I was unable to enjoy all of the leg exercises. This is a great DVD for pregnant people, and people with mild or temporary disabilities, not severe disabilities. I will still watch it, and do whatever I am able to do, and hopefully, see results.",1288742400,2,400,4.728571428571429
8278085,5,B001AMSG1M,I will use this DVD to develop a yoga class for seniors and people who can not get on the floor.,1278288000,3,96,3.619047619047619

8278087,3,B001AMSG1M,"I am a physical therapist working with people with neurological problems.  I bought this DVD because I want to incorporate yoga into my treatment; I've practiced yoga myself about seven years and know the great benefits. Although I liked the natural setting and Ann's pleasant voice, I was disappointed in some of the postures demonstrated because I felt they were incorrect - Ann's feet are frequently turned out although they should be pointing straight forward, in line with knees and hips; she bends forward with a rounded instead of a straight back which defeats the purpose of some of the poses.  Although she mentions modifications if someone finds a pose difficult, they're not really clearly presented.  Not enough emphasis is placed on the fact that you should breath in and out through the nose only. I'm glad that I also purchased ""Lakshmi Voelker Chair Yoga, Single Chair Yoga"" because Lakshmi places much more importance on proper alignment and breathing and very clearly demonstrates different levels of difficulty for each pose, making it easy to modify for my patients.",1264550400,47,1086,5.089887640449438
8278088,5,B001AMSG1M,"Great DVD for my 66 year old mom.  She really enjoyed it, found the 1/2 hour to be the perfect length, and said she found it to be the right difficulty level for her.",1262044800,4,166,3.8823529411764706
8278089,5,B001AMSG1M,"My mom is 92 years old and although she is in really good shape, I didn't like her getting down on the floor with me when I do my yoga at her house. I bought her this, and she was great at it! It is only about 25 minutes, which is perfect, and no floor work. And afterwards, she slept like a baby! The DVD skipped a bit, but I did the toothpaste trick the guy at the electronics store taught me, and it cleaned it right up...",1250294400,8,425,3.840909090909091
