8058386,2,B0009941SO,"After recently viewing this DVD, I can't for the life of me see why they call this comedy. I bought this thinking I would really be laughing and it appears that the comedian did more fake laughing than I did. The jokes were really weak and on some he went too far with the jokes (especially the slave segment) I know it's not easy standing in front of a lot of people to tell jokes but it appears that at times this comedian was just throwing stuff together.",1175731200,,458,4.215909090909091
