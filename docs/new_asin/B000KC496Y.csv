Now if only my children spoke French.",1349049600,,139,4.6
2688041,5,B000KC496Y,"Ocelot has great style. As usual, in these six short stories, the graphics and the animation are elegant, concise, beautifully evocative. And his choice of subject matter is flawless : he has an unmistakable, artistic way of blending humor and romance. The six stories (all based, I suppose, on folk material) range from Ancient Egypt to 3000 AD, from the moonlit mountains of Hokusai's Japan to the Middle Ages in some nondescript, fantastic Old World. Each tale, quietly told, provides food for thought and nice conversations - if only because a brief prologue shows a boy, a girl, and an old man discussing their choice of material and reviewing the documentation before they enter their respective roles. My daughters, ages 8 1/2 and 6, both love it, and so do I, as well as all the other children and grown-ups I have recommended or offered it so far. It has become one of my favourite gifts. I don't know whether ""Dragons et Princesses"" has been released in the US already. If it has, don't miss it : it displays the exact same qualities.",1295136000,,1044,4.7103825136612025
2688042,5,B000KC496Y,"I watched another Michael Ocelot's animation (Prince Quest), I really loved it, then I tried this one. It's very interesting because the animation style they used. The story is well-written. My daughter and I enjoy it so much, eventhough she doesn't understand French, she likes learning a new language.",1255824000,2,303,5.204081632653061
2688043,5,B000KC496Y,"Centered around what would, at first glance, be quite a limited premise; this film rewards with a depth of character and presentation styles that defies the one dimensional [no pun intended] format that it explores so brilliantly; a silhouette style of paper puppets popular to this day in many parts of the world, although rarely executed with this sort of flare.

Set in a disused theatre, the three visible ""creators within the creation"" lead us through the design, fabrication and performance of six thoroughly unique and emotionally engaging variations of a prince or suitor of some sort and his queen or object of affection.  The results are often surprising, always delightful and more than once eloquent on the level of Aesop, et al.  The ""mechanics"", to borrow a term from JapAnimation, are equally a wonder to behold with the dragon the dragon in vignette 3 being an absolute treat.

My simple  summary doesn't do the visually enthralling style and entrancing mechanism justice [by a long shot] but suffice to say that the ""One Minute to Talk"" provided in the middle of the six vignettes is thoroughly insufficient for the richness and imagination that [even without having seen the other candidates] probably gave this film a solid sweep for The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences prize that is was awarded last year.

This was something of a blind purchase for my Animation library which has been preferential to the Japanese creations of Miyazaki Hiyao San, Katushiro Otomo San, et al, as well as the more ""mass produced"" efforts of Studio 4C, Mad House and the newer generation of Nipponese makers.

A little thought and I would have remembered that there is a long tradition of animation in France [""Forbidden Planet"" and ""Light Years"" come to mind right away] that, while perhaps rarely receiving the recognition afforded to similar items from the Land of the Rising Sun, are equally artistic, diverse and brilliant.  Take a look around for some French Animation - you will likely be quite pleased.

This item is Safe for all ages and entertaining for all humans... as to why an English dubbed version is not available, I have no clue other than it posses rather unique marketing challenges.

2688044,4,B000KC496Y,"This animation represents thoroughly modern imagery and imagination. It also pays homage to the oldest extant feature-length animation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Prince-Achmed/dp/B0000714B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Prince Achmed</a>. The silhouetted characters in this draw directly from that older movie, even if the characters and magic gadget are quite contemporary.

A half-dozen vignettes form this feature, with a little story-telling glue between them. In that outer story, a boy and girl share a fantasy. Then, with the help of the gadget, they enter into it. One of those stories has the flavor of a Japanese folktale, another shows the magic kiss gone terribly (and repeatedly) wrong, another shows a science fiction variation on the quest for the princess's hand, and so on. They're all easy to enjoy, but that tribute to animation history adds a pleasant overtone as well.

2688045,5,B000KC496Y,"I loved this movie! Nice to see a clean, modern version of cut-out
style animation (like Adventures of Prince Achmed). Highly recommended.",1236297600,,138,5.318181818181818
2688046,5,B000KC496Y,"I've wanted to see this film for a while now, being a fan of Michel Ocelot's previous work, Kirikou and the Sorceress. He has a wonderful style of animation, and a good knack for telling traditional fairy tales and folk tales. In Princes and Princesses, he does something rather unique, which I was quite excited to see: the animation is done with cutouts, using only black silhouettes and brightly colored backgrounds to tell the story. I think this technique worked wonderfully in this instance, since this is in fact 6 short fairy tales, tied together by the fact that it is a teacher and his two pupils that are thinking them up/acting out each story.

I absolutely adore fairy tales, folk tales and mythology, and each of the story here takes place in a different culture, which was quite fun. The first story is called ""The Princess of Diamonds"", and it is kind of a general fairy tale. The second one is called ""The Fig Boy"", and takes place in ancient Egypt, inspired by hieroglyphs. The third is a medieval tale called ""The Sorceress"". The fourth is a Japanese tale inspired by the works of Hokusai. The fifth is a Grimm Brothers-esque story with a bit of sci-fi thrown in (why not?). And the final one is a kind of parody of English tales. The nice thing about the smaller stories is also that it keeps the attention of little ones or those with short attention spans, as each is only a few minutes long.

And yes, it is only available in French with English subtitles, and some of those subtitles are not always correct or spell-checked. But my 11-year-old sister and I had no problem following the movie. All in all, I was very pleased with this little film. Definitely my cup of tea, and a wonderful addition to any fairy tale collection.",1234915200,17,1751,4.573248407643312
2688047,2,B000KC496Y,"plot: there are 6 fairy tales told throughout this film.  you start off with writers behind desks brainstorming about what to write about.  the writers agree on something.  someone is sent off to be fitted with a costume.  this triangle appears.  and the story starts.  the story ends.  wash, rinse, repeat.

the whole time, you are looking at silhouettes (like the cover of the dvd).  so the film is a little dark.  i honestly thought the characters on the front of the dvd cover were crickets but they are people.  go figure.  to me, this was offputting ... watching dark shadows instead of bright people, but some people might like this!

the stories themselves: good prevails, evil is punished; these are true fairytales.  but there is a sense of the Grimm fairytale 'meanness' in it.  for example, this grandmother is being touted around by this guy.  he tries to steal her coat but she refuses to get off his back.  and when he threatens her, she chokes him or kicks him in his knee.  there's that weird vibe of - okay, who is the bad person here?

the translation.  i don't know french but i do know that ""oui, majesty"" should not be translated as ""you, majesty"".  i also read ""tartoise"" instead of ""tortoise"".  and then, who can forget ""design to accept queen, this fig"".  but don't let that prevent you from seeing the movie! you will understand what's going on.

this movie was not my cup of tea, but i'm sure someone would like it.

i did really like the 5th story.  DETECTION, TRANSPARENCY, MEGA RADAR!  but not enough to change my view of the whole film.

best random quote of the film: i love leek soup.",1229644800,6,1617,4.520833333333333
2688048,5,B000KC496Y,I'm always on the look out for movies in French with English subtitles to use in conjunction with my daughter's French studies.  She is 11 and really likes this movie.  The French is clear and easy to understand.  Some of the English subtitles had  spelling errors but still easy enough to follow.  She finds the stories interesting and enjoyable.,1218585600,7,347,4.813559322033898
2688049,5,B000KC496Y,"There's plenty in this (probably judging from the way the animation looks and the character design) to satisfy everyone in the family, or even your picky tastes.

The story follows two young teens, a boy and a girl, in a sort of stage/playhouse with a conductor and this magnificent machine. All the two youngsters have to do is come up with an idea, feed it to the machine, and they are transformed into the characters of the created story.

It deals with romance and loss - and beautiful lessons such as choosing the less-taken path, generosity, and not judging solely by looks among other things.

A big classic to boost to your collection. It's in English subtitles which is no big deal.",1203379200,6,691,4.647540983606557

8155483,5,B000KC496Y,"This is an absolute classic, pure A+ no question French style all the way.
It is a black-silhouetted animation but there are some colors and especially when there appears diamond like figures, it's like dreamy bright shinny thing that makes my heart beat.

I happened to make a shadow Animation-Live action short film 15 years ago and it was kind of a failure in my thought and still have this dream making a good one some day so this one was some kind of a mentor like figure to me.

The movie contains 6 fairy tales. All of them are amazing but the first and the last were my best.

The first is a story about a guy who loves the princess who constantly brings fruite from his tree and ends up with gaining what he wants.
The background art was so very beautiful. Also the diamond shinning was so eye blindingly enchanting to watch.
I cannot believe my eyes how they made the amination that charming.
They must have spent months and months to creat that way.

The last one is about the prince and the princess who happens to kiss for the fist time and happens to be changed to a different sorts all the time and they have to keep kissing to be changed again and again. Among them were frog, Whale, fly, girraf, and so on.
When at last both becomes each other's figure, they were able to go back to the palace but they are no more themself but each other's figure.

The animation was so well made and it is not only for children but for everyone.

If you liked this you should also watch <The Adventures of Prince Achmed> a legendary shadow animation made back in 1926.",1463529600,,1570,4.3231292517006805

8155485,5,B000KC496Y,"An absolute must-see for people of all ages. Lovely short renditions of fairytales from around the world, some original by Ocelot and also one that is historical, that have the flavor of the culture and period they are depicting. Too bad they didn't include all of the ones he did in this TV series, and also, that they don't sell one with French subtitles as well...why is it that only English people get subtitles?",1394928000,,416,4.635135135135135
8155486,5,B000KC496Y,I can't describe in words this movie. It's like a journey to a fairy land. with charming stories and a wonderful design. I really loved it.,1392508800,,139,4.384615384615385
8155487,5,B000KC496Y,"Granted that it is episodic and has minimal  connective story, this is very entertaining & lovely. The stories have a variety of styles within the overall shadow technique and different moods.

You can see the influence of Lotte Reiniger but I think Ocelot's figures are not actual shadow puppets, but computer generated, I think? I have to read the box!",1379635200,,354,4.883333333333334
8155488,1,B000KC496Y,I was very disappointed to find that this DVD ( despite the English title) does not have English subtitles. Completely useless to my 9 year old daughter.,1377216000,,153,4.703703703703703
8155489,5,B000KC496Y,I loved this movie.  I recommend it to everyone-- it has gorgeous silhouette animation and beautiful stories that really make you think.,1375142400,,136,5.181818181818182

We watched it before we gave it to him to celebrate his graduation in Comuter Animation.  After viewing it we had to have a copy for ourselves.",1369008000,,244,4.651162790697675
8155491,5,B000KC496Y,"This is a must for anyone wishing to study the silhouette animation form. In that there are very few examples to readily draw from in the modern day marketplace. Not too mentioned the acclaimed director behind the force of this production.

This might be very good for American children as well, or at least it should be. There is not too much color for the hyper minds of their societal youth, yet it does provide historical takes on every kids embellishment or fascination with royalty and monarchy. In the sense that there are different takes and adventures on princes and princesses from varying cultural perspectives. It is humor filled for all ages to appreciate.

The craft and design work is none to miss. This simplicity and perfection in composition and staging is a great start for anyone aiming to study the process of animation or this particular type of form.",1361836800,,873,4.8133333333333335
