685291,5,6303482619,"This was the first Troughton era video that i've seen, and immediately became a Troughton fan.  (although i must say I was a bit disappointed with Tomb of the Cvbermen).  The acting is superb, the plot excellent, and  despite its overal lack of violence, contains probably one of the scariest  scenes in all of who.  (For those that have seen it, Notice Packer's  absence! (i think in episode 6)  Although episodes 1 and 4 are missing,  this was the third longest single serial ever in Doctor Who, and the 6  remaining episodes more than make up for it.  For those that are a little  bit tired of the pervasive foolishness in the Tom and Collin Baker eras,  this with its interesting and serious characterizations (especially of  Vaughn) make this a must buy.",953078400,3,759,4.659090909090909
685292,4,6303482619,"This story is quite pivotal in Doctor Who's history, introducing UNIT and setting the scene for the path the show would take in the 1970s. It is slick, stylish and very entertaining. It is good to see the Cybermen once again; seeing them play such a minor role is an interesting variation, especially subordinate to one of Doctor Who's most impressive and memorable villains, Tobias Vaughn. He is cold, calculating and oozes malice. He is probably the best of the Cybermen's ""stooges"" and his plans to manipulate them give him an added realism. ""The Invasion"" is a genuine tour de force, with some genuinely tense scenes (the sewer incident in episodes 5/6) and memorable moments (the Cybermen walking through London). UNIT is given a strong introduction and the Brigadier is a good leader - it's such a pity both are reduced to such pathetic, bumbling by numbers military caricatures by the end of the Pertwee era. The first appearance by Benton is also one of his best portrayals. There are a few quibbles with the story - the ending is too abrupt with no real climax and there are some quite truly awful characters - the Adolf Hitler lookalike Gregory; Vaughn's incompetent henchman Packer; Captain Turner and Isobel Watkins. (I'm glad there is a romantic end for these two - they are both so dull they deserve each other!) It's also a relief Turner didn't continue with UNIT (although Mike Yates is just as much a prat!) But overall, ""The Invasion"" is worthwhile - the loss of episodes 1 and 4 don't take too much away from the story and the links by Nicholas Courtney are well done.",948931200,,1587,4.712230215827338
685293,2,6303482619,"The ""Invasion"" has always been one of those ""Holy Grail"" episodes of Doctor Who that you hear about and read about and always want to see.  Unfortunately, the story that I constructed in my mind  from the bits of info I've been able to glean over the years and the  production stills I've seen was much better than the reality.
I must say  that Tobias Vaughn is a fascinating and well-acted villan; much more  three-dimensional than the standard seething maniac.  The Cybermen,  unfortunately, are critically underused as they are in many stories.  In  this story, they seem hell-bent on taking the most difficult way to do  things.  If they don't care about people, and they don't care about the  buildings, why don't they rain death from space?  Why do they slowly build  an advance team in the sewers of London?  It doesn't make sense...and they  way the Doctor finally defeats them is hurried and unsatisfying.
If you  love Troughton and the Cybermen as I do, buy ""Tomb of the  Cybermen"" and watch it, like, a hundred times.  It is more intriguing,  more beliveable and more exciting at 4 episodes than this one at 8.",939168000,3,1121,4.680412371134021

685380,5,6303482619,"The BBC really screwed the pooch in getting rid of some of the best Doctor Who stories of the classic era. While this isn't one of the MOST memorable stories it has a lot of important firsts. The introduction of U.N.I.T., The promotion of the (late) Lethbridge-Stewart to Brigadier and one of the most cinematographic-ally beautiful episodes of classic Who. The sets are wonderful, the on location shoots are clear and the sound is great. I recommend this episode to any Whovian who wants to complete their Troughton/classic Who collection, or wants a good (and sadly discontinued) DVD collection.",1391990400,,597,5.040404040404041
685381,5,6303482619,"This is important serial for it's introduction of U.N.I.T. and the establishment of the Brigadier as a recurring character under multiple doctors.

While corporate tycoon Tobias Vaughn appears only to be interested in cornering the market on electronics, his real agenda includes facilitating a Cybermen invasion of Earth that he hopes will leave him in charge. The Doctor stumbles onto the scheme while trying to get the TARDIS fixed and renews his acquaintance with the Brigadier and sets out to uncover the truth.

This is a superb Doctor Who story. The newly animated Parts 1 and 4 are very realistically looking and actually add to the series. Part 4 includes an escape hanging on a helicopter. Somehow I doubt 1960s special effects could have done it as well as the animation. Zoe proves an invaluable companion with her brilliant math skills that help her save the world.

Kevin Stoney's Tobias Vaughn is the perfect villain (and one of the best Doctor Who villains of all time) for this piece: arrogant, cocky, sadistic, and a bit unhinged but not stupid. Vaughn is not as dumb as the people in Tomb of the Cybermen who expected to hold the entire species at bay with one Cybermen weapon and thus obtain their cooperation. He's calculating and smug.

The downside to this story is that the writer's imagination was greater than the special effects budget which hurt the look of the ending. Still, this is a very engrossing and entertaining tale that's a must-see.",1386979200,,1471,4.872

I saw most of the early Dr Who episodes back in the 60s and 70s, but I must have missed this one which made it even more enjoyable.
Two of the eight episodes have been lost, so they were rather expertly animated to match the original soundtrack.
All in all I found it most enjoyable, and nostalgic too, of course.
If you're into classic Dr Who this is a must. Thoroughly recommended.

Also a word of praise for Amazon. It took only two weeks for the DVD set to arrive in Australia which is much faster than usual. Well done, Amazon. Even the Tardis couldn't have done it faster!",1349049600,,793,4.394557823129252

You have a cunning villan in Tobias Vaugh, a terrific alien threat, and some cat and mouse cloak and dagger type of action in it.

The animated segments in no way take away from the experience. In fact I think it adds to it greatly. This is easily worth the price. My only complaint however is the discs were lose in the case when they were delivered to me. But there were no scratches fortunately.",1347753600,,688,4.375

Maybe that is where they came up with that story! =>> The Original Story 46 - The Invasion w/ Patrick Troughton !!!

and while in the New Who story... the genius actually created the Cybermen in the parallel whoniverse ....
.... the OLD Story 46 had the Cybermen already a force to be reckoned with.

The Electronics Genius who tries to control the Electronic Aliens.... Yeah right!

I was very sorry to have some of the video missing, but it was softened by at least having the sound & some pictures.

685436,5,6303482619,"So here we go- Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor, the return of Lethbridge_stewart (now a Brigadier), the debut of UNIT, Cybermen, and Tobias Vaughn a brilliant madman who steals the show.

Great stuff, and there are many others I'm sure who will review the content of the episodes. What I'd like to focus on is the thing that really earns it six out five stars- the animated reconstructions of the two missing episodes.

You see the BBC used to dispose of recorded episodes after their airing in order make room for more (this was the late 60's, okay?) so the only surviving portion of episodes one and four are audio tracks recorded  by fans during the tv broadcasts themselves.

Enter Cosgrove Hall,""The Wind in the Willows,"" people is you're from the UK. After cleaning up and making workable composites from the audio tracks they then animated the missing episodes in a lovely, moody noir that fits beautifully with the original eps. I've also found that the animated restorations are actually more accessible to some modern viewer. They accept an asthetic in animation that looks ""cheesy"" in live action. And we all know how large a rep our beloved Docotor has for weak and comical special effects.

There are many stories that are missing, almost all of Troughton's era for instance, but have surviving audio. If the BBC is smart they should start Cosgrove Hall to work on animating them and getting them out to us.

This is classic 60s era Who, and if you have any taste for that era it is a must have. It is also one of the most effective and creative approaches to restoration I have ever seen.

685437,5,6303482619,"I won't rehash what everyone else has already written.  However, I will say that I am thrilled that the Beeb released this.  What a great Troughten era episode.  I do disagree with the assessment from some that the animation is great.  It isn't awful, but it could have been MUCH better.  The best comparison is Johnny Quest.  Really.  The characters move like stop-action filming.  I wish that they had sprung for some better animation - CGI would have been great.  Having said this, it is head & shoulders better than the reconstructions with the stills (these are lovingly made, but can be tedious to watch).  Bottom line:  the animation is only two episodes & it is watchable & the story is great, so get it.",1236470400,,712,4.616
685438,5,6303482619,The animation of the missing episodes were brilliant!  Let's hope that they will apply this formula to more of the first and second doctor's stories!  I'm on the edge of my seat for this one!,1230940800,,191,4.428571428571429

685511,4,6303482619,"Second Doctor Who actor Patrick Troughton gives one of his best performances not ""entirely"" lost like most of the episodes from 1963-1970.  While some of those stories exist in thier entirety, most are incomplete. THE INVASION has 6 of the 8 episodes that remaim entirely.  The other two episodes (episodes 1 and 4) make this DVD truely UNINQUE.  While video footage of 1 and 4 has been lost the audio remained, and now replaced with animated reconstructions. What hurts this otherwise CLASIC STORY is the sheer lenghth, which can be blamed on the BBC after the original script called for a six part story.  These stories are a part of the extras which are a must for any fan of Doctor Who.  The real treasure of this story is three-fold #1 the introduction of Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT #2 the return of the Cybermen the sound of thier invasion itself is priceless #3 Kevin Stoney as the real villian of this story, Tobias Vaughn is worth purchase price alone.

685515,5,6303482619,"I watched The Invasion straight through on DVD twice complete with animation episodes, then ended up listening to the whole thing on a long car trip on audio, all in the span of one week.

It says massive things when I say that this was eight episodes, and NOT ONCE was I bored.

The producers of the show were planning a new direction for Doctor Who, one that'd take the series completely to Earth, and this makes a fantastic first impression as a sort of ""pilot"" for this new era. Needing some electronic spare parts for the TARDIS, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe search for Professor Travers, only to find that they've left their house to a Professor Watkins, who has been missing for several days. Thus starts an adventure of revelation after revelation of what's going on at International Electromatics, a company that has the monopoly on practically everything in the world. Tobias Vaughn is well casted by Kevin Stoney, as Wendy Padbury (Zoe) said on the commentary, the scenes between Vaughn and the Doctor when they're playing mindgames with each other could've been ruined by a lesser actor, but you're practically on the edge of your seat the whole time.

This is the first story to feature the newly formed UNIT, led by Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, and what a way to introduce it! The return of the Cybermen, but what does Vaughn have planned for them... this sets the bar so high for the stories to come (And indeed for the new Jon Pertwee era just around the corner.)

And it's not just drama either. There are some good scenes with Vaughn's all brawn and no brain sidekick Packer. I love the scene where the Doctor pretends he's going to co-operate, ""I can't let you hurt Zoe and Isabel, so when Tobias Vaughn comes- oh there he is now!"" and then shoves him and runs off to the lift when Packer turns the other way. Something subtle like that is all you need. Oh, and how could you not love the last bit, where Isabel's snapping pictures while the Brigadier and his men run off to take care of the Cybermen's transmitter, and the Doctor first protests, but then strikes some heroic poses while men run all around them!

Eight episodes, and it doesn't flag. A teriffic achievement all around.",1201996800,10,2202,4.607142857142857
685516,4,6303482619,"I was an addict to Who stuff back in the 1970's ( college time) but wondered if there were other Doctors besides Tom Baker.  When I got to Arizona, the PBS station presented the other Doctors besides T. Baker.  I took a fancy to
Doctor no. 2 but there were not many episodes of him sad to say.  The Invasion filled the bill.  Even a fill in by Nicholas Courtney for the lost episodes was a nice touch.",1201824000,,401,4.102564102564102
685517,3,6303482619,"A classic Cybermen story restored fully thanks to animation. At first I was wary, but when I viewed the final product, I was more than happy with the result. The animated episodes were well done and did not in my opinion take anything away from the overall story. I suggest they try this process with other Doctor Who stories with ""missing episodes"".",1197849600,,350,4.661290322580645
685518,5,6303482619,"Perhaps the biggest testament to a story of this length is the ability to sit through it in one viewing. Since The Invasion is eight episodes in length, one must devote nearly fours hours to watch it in one evening.  I find it beneficial to view any Doctor Who story over six parts over two evenings.  Truth be told, I can't even sit through a two hour movie, period. However, Doctor Who is different, and The Invasion is exceptional!  In the end, I had to watch this over two nights, but not because I grew tired of it, but rather I grew tired.  I started watching this late in the evening, and it was around midnight when the end credits to episode six rolled.  Enthralled with the story as I was, I could have finished it in one sitting. However, the need for sleep and the desire to avoid spending the next day in a zombie-like state prevented me from doing so.  Therefore I watched the last two episodes the following evening.  However, the point is that I could have finished it in one evening, if I had the time and foresight to start watching it an hour earlier.

The Invasion flourishes under a healthy pace, solid acting from the regulars as well as the guest cast, plenty of action sequences, escapes, recaptures, escapes..., and wonderful location footage.  Many critics consider this to be padding to get enough scenes to fill the entire eight episodes.  This line of thought is rather unfortunate and simply untrue.  Rather, it is the very fabric that makes The Invasion so watchable and highly enjoyable.  That and Sally Faulkner (Isobel Watkins), the nicest pair of legs in Doctor Who history!  We also have the pilot episode (if we can call it that) to UNIT, setting up the Earth-based stories that would be heavily utilized during the Third Doctor era.  The Doctor is heavily aided by the new Brigadier, Lethbridge Stewart, in thwarting off a Cybermen invasion.  The scene of the Cybermen advancing from St. Paul's Cathedral ranks as one of the most defining moments in Doctor Who history and left a permanent impression on the minds of youngsters watching in the 60s.

This may be the best of the many Cybermen stories during the 1960s, however, the Cybermen take a back seat to the main villain here, Tobias Vaughn, chillingly portrayed by Kevin Stoney.  Arguably, Vaughn represents the greatest villain ever in Doctor Who, certainly of the Second Doctor era.  The half cyborg is so consumed by hate that even when confronted with the fact that he has been duped by the Cybermen, he begrudgingly agrees to help the Doctor only because he despises the Cybermen for betraying their uneasy alliance, not for the more valliant motivation of saving his home planet from destruction.

Incidentally, the animation of episodes one and four, wiped by the BBC archives and sadly never re-discovered, is as good as animation can be. Barring re-discovery of further episodes, animation can be utilized to complete stories of which most episodes exist, such as Tenth Planet and Ice Warriors. However, trying to do an entire story in animated form simply can not be considered the same.  The Beeb has discovered a very acceptable way of regaining lost episodes. Unfortunately, no alternative currently exists.",1189987200,3,3215,4.800362976406533
685588,4,6303482619,"I think the first 4 episodes of invasion drag a little, but it is not too bad, considering this is an 8 part Who, when most Who stories are only 4-6 parts. After the 4th episode, the story moved right along at a good pace. It was nice to see the very first episode featuring the Brigadeir. It would be nice to see ""The Web of Fear"" which features the Colonel before being promoted to Brigadeir, but I believe that story's almost totally missing (I could be wrong). Back to Invasion, I enjoy the on location shots outside. Real land, real cars, real people. Don't get me wrong. I love Who and like others must over look the cheap props especially from the 60's, but on location shots with real cars and people can make a cheap show look a lot better is some ways, and I believe that is true with invasion.
  As far as the animation goes, I believe it's very good. I like that they kept it B@W to look as original as possible. In the special features, the animators noted that they were very careful to make the seens as close to the original as they could, knowing that long-time fans would know if they went wrong.
  I gave 4 stars, rather than 5, only because of the slight dragging of the first half. Like I said though, the dragging is only slight.",1189123200,,1251,4.265822784810126
685589,4,6303482619,"Hats off to Cosgrove Hall. These are the people who animated ""The Wind in the Willows,"" if anyone knows about that.
I am absolutely awestruck that I can see Doctor Who as I could not before. I remember this one from the 60's and the VHS release didn't do much for me with the narrated links.
The only reason this gets four, not five, stars is that the story is overlong. We don't get to see the actual enemy until the end of the fourth episode after which the Doctor dispenses with his foes with just about a flick of the wrist.
In the extras, Cosgrove Hall say that they would love to re-animate Doctor Who.
I sincerely hope that Auntie Beeb recognises this and that there are true fans out here.",1184716800,,697,4.287878787878788
685590,5,6303482619,"As any ""Doctor Who"" fan knows, one of the great tragedies of the series is that in the 1970's the BBC trashed a lot of the episodes from the show. As a result of this, we now have several missing 1st Doctor episodes and only a very few 2nd Doctor ones. On the plus side, we have the compelte audio for all episodes

Enter Cosgrove Hall.

In conjunction with the BBC, Cosgrove Hall has created animated versions of the two missing episodes in this eight-part serial. The animated scenes work, and work well. They're somewhat stylized, but not overly so and frankly, after seeing the first one, it was a bit of a jolt to return to live-action all of a sudden.

The story itself is one of the better ones. Basically the Cybermen are trying to invade Earth, have help from a villain worthy of James Bond (and who I would've liked to have seen back again on the show), and are thwarted by the Doctor, his companions and, in their first offical appearance, UNIT, commanded by the newly promoted Brigadeer Allister Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart.

For its important place in ""Doctor Who"" history, and for the chance to see missing episodes replaced, this video is worth buying. There's also many extras thrown onto the discs, including behind the scenes stuff and commentary (which I rather wish they had gotten the actor who played Vaughn to do. I understand he did some on one of the missing episodes in the ""Lost in Time"" discs, and he's still alive and kicking. A pity he didn't do commentary for this).

Another good reason to buy this, of course, is to encourge more of this sort of thing from the BBC. There's quite a few stories that are missing only one or two episodes, and it would be nice to have them done in animated form, particularly, say, ""The Tenth Planet"". The only way they'll do more is if this one is a success, so buy it, darn you! :)

Rumor has it, btw, that in one of the scenes in the first episode, you can see the words ""Bad Wolf"", inserted by one of the animators. I haven't been able to spot it. Can you? Buy the vid and find out! :)",1183507200,,2051,4.398416886543536

On a high quality display the episodes demonstrate severe amounts of strobing and line noise and also don't appear as sharp as their disc 1 equivalents. As of now BBC Video has expressed no interest in correcting the transfer of these episodes, so be aware that the R1 Version of The Invasion is slightly inferior to its British cousin.",1182643200,,490,4.776470588235294
685592,5,6303482619,"If you are a fan of UNIT from the classic Dr Who series, then you will very much enjoy this story as one the paves the way for the Pertwee Era. This was a story I had never seen before, and because some of the film segments are missing (episode 1 and 4 I believe) it was much appreciated that the BBC commissioned flash animation to be paired with the audio soundtrack of the production to ""restore"" the missing film segments. And they did a fantastic job. Its a bit odd, at first, watching the animation, but because the episode is all in black and white, the transition is not difficult from animated to film segments. Very well done.

Troughton plays the Doctor wonderfully. Fraizer Heines has wonderful chemistry with the Doctor, and Zoe is played very well. Loved the story overall.

I recommend this story for any fan of the Classic Series, and those that love Cyberman stories.",1178928000,,884,4.553459119496855
685593,5,6303482619,"There was a time when the BBC destroyed their prints of old television shows.  This significantly impacted the Patrick Troughton era of Doctor Who; of the 21 serials, only 6 survive with all episodes intact.  Thankfully, fans during this time (1966-1969) tape recorded the episodes as they played over television, so only the visuals remain beyond recovery.

This 8 episode serial ""The Invasion"" was missing episodes 1 and 4.  An animation company lovingly restored the soundtrack of these missing episodes from fan recordings, then used the shooting scripts to animate the episodes.  The results are, of course, a bit jarring, going back and forth from animation to live action.  And this is not animation with the fluidity of Disney or Japanese anime.  However, it doesn't need to be.  Due to budget constraints, most Doctor Who stories had much more dialogue than physical action, so having limited animation actually matches the style of the show quite well.  The animators took great care to make the characters 'look right', and tried to match backgrounds, props and so on as accurately as possible.

The result?  A classic serial presented amazingly well.  And the extras are great too--especially the 'Making of' featurettes.  This Who fan hopes that many other fragmented serials will someday receive this loving treatment.  Oh, and the story is great, too!

Highly recommended.",1178928000,,1387,5.184684684684685

685595,4,6303482619,"This is a fun story with the ever likable Patrick Troughton facing off against the famous Cybermen.  The set is for the most part excellent, with the surprisingly effective animated episodes filling in for those lost during the BBC purges of the 70s, and the restoration work for the surviving episodes is top notch to the point that you could almost convince yourself that you're watching a live broadcast.

However, my enthusiasm is muted by the fact that Episodes 5 - 8 on Disc 2 exhibit noticeable jitter in the vertical detail due to a mastering error when converting the material from PAL to NTSC.  Steve Roberts of the Official Restoration Team described the problem as ""nasty"" and wrote:

""Oh dear, the episodes on disc 2 are a bit of a mess, aren't they?

""The fact that it has gone composite at some point is almost irrelevant - the cross-colour is just about detectable in some shots, but I doubt I would have noticed it during normal playback if I wasn't looking for it. The major problem is the terrible line-twitter on the standards converter, I haven't seen a converter so poor in many a year. The end credits look terrible and there's constant twitter throughout the episodes. I suspect it's also knocking back the resolution of the picture as a whole, as episode eight in particular looked a lot softer than I expected.

""The episodes on disc 1 are fine - looks like a decent Alchemist standards converter has been used. But disc 2 has clearly been done on a much older converter which has either a composite input or output.""

[...]

Unfortunately, neither the BBC nor 2|entertain has expressed any interest in addressing this error.  The good news is that many people don't notice the problem when watching on a typical NTSC television.  The bad news that if you try watching Disc 2 on a high-resolution progressive scan set then you're definitely going to notice.

Bottom line: I would recommend this DVD set with some reservations.",1177977600,4,1952,4.745562130177515

The animation used to restore episodes 1 and 4 is astonishingly good. Animation is no substitute for original footage, but this two-disc set demonstrates that it can serve as a good bridge in important stories where only one or two episodes have been lost. ""The Invasion"" was a turning point in the series, marking the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and the introduction of UNIT as well as a new Cybermen costume design. The scenes of Cybermen walking the streets of London are iconic. The BBC should now waste no time in using animation to restore missing episodes in stories like ""The Ice Warriors"" and ""The Tenth Planet.""",1176163200,,773,4.819548872180451
685669,5,6303482619,This is a great  science fiction show from the 1960's.  but unlike many other efforts from that decade this one features the fine performance of Patrick Troughton as the Doctor.  He was the second doctor and he  played the role from 1966-69.  The supporting cast is excellent as well;  the best of which is a chilling performance from  Tobias vaughn who is the actor who plays the lead villian.  He is both sinister and charming at the same time which is not an easy feat to accomplish.  Two of the episodes of this eight part serial are missing so they  replaced them with excellent animation. The animation features the original soundtrack of the series and that only adds to the greatness of the animators efforts. The animation is so good that I could easily watch other whole missing stories of doctor who in that format. And best of all It doesn't even seem jarring to go from animation in one episode to viewing  the next episode in original film.  The Invasion is also a excellent story featuring effects from the pre computerized era of special effects.  But like all doctor who stories you watch them for the fine acting and great stories anyway.  This dvd is a fine addition to the collection of any Doctor Who fan.

685670,5,6303482619,"Like many, I began watching Doctor Who during the Tom Baker Era.  But when my PBS station (thanks to the Beeb), started airing the 'lost' episodes from Hartnell to Pertwee, I began to really enjoy the series a lot more.

Invasion was definitely a good episode and follows up from the Mind Robber, comparing the VHS and DVD version, the animated scenes actually do the episode more than justice.  (In fact, when Nelvana wanted to do an animated Doctor Who, they admitted they wanted to actually use lost episode scripts, completing the First and Second Doctor's adventures.)  Amazingly Cosgrove-Hall productions maintain the proper atmosphere as you feel the episodes aren't spliced in, but actually flow with the series.

And, yes, I do admit, it's far better than Nicholas Courtney just linking together the lost episodes with stills shown from them.  You even have to give kudos to the BBC for the productions of the early series, because even with the limited sfx, the stories still work.

Even more surprising, David Tennant (Doctor #10) episodes: The Rise of the Cybermen and Age of Steel were actually inspired by this particular episode.  You could probably detect the parallels between the stories, but the episode is definitely a must to get and both old and new Who fans will enjoy watching Invasion and learning how The Doctor fought earlier villains before the Slitheen crossed paths with the Time Lord.",1175904000,2,1415,4.966101694915254
685671,5,6303482619,"If you're even slightly acquainted with Doctor Who, you'll know many stories from the late 60s were wiped and destroyed - this was a time before ""re-runs"". This is one of those missing stories.  Of the original 8 episodes, only 6 remain. The ""lost"" episodes have been re-created with animation. This provides a wonderful continuity and allows ""The Invasion"" to be experienced ""in full"". The animation is wonderful, and you can tell that the animation team worked very hard to bring you what you would have seen on the screen if the episodes weren't lost. If you're unaware, all of the _audio_ of every Doctor Who story exists - so the dialogue, sound effects and music are authentic, and aren't recreated.

This method of filling in the gaps - with animation - makes this truly a ""resurrected"" story. If you are even a mild fan of Doctor Who, I highly recommend this. The story, featuring the Cybermen, is a classic. Vote with your money - tell the BBC and 2 Entertain that we appreciate the extra work and effort into bringing this story back.

685674,5,6303482619,"I've enjoyed the Invasion for a long time.  I first read Ian Marter's nice novelization.  Then I bought the VCR tapes in the 90's with Courtney's narration for the missing episodes.  Now, at long last, the entire serial is available, gloriously restored by the geniuses at the Restoration Team and with the missing episodes brought back to life with old audio recordings and Cosgrove Hall Animation.

This is one of the best of the Troughton stories.  At the time time, the series was in danger of cancellation and this was their effort to reboot to a new format, one that would be finalized with Jon Pertwee.  More action-oriented with closer ties to today's Earth. It saw the first appearance of UNIT, the organization that would anchor the series for the next three years.

And it delivers.  The Invasion is by turns exciting and suspensful.  It's padded a bit in the early episodes but the last two are great.  Who can forget the sight of the Cybermen walking down the streets of London? Or feel the tension as Earth tries to retaliate against the Cyber fleet? It's directed by Douglas Camfield, one of the best of the Doctor Who directors. People praise his action scenes, but watch the way he films his actors, letting them work their craft. He works within the limitations of the series, making it stand up well after nearly 40 years. And he was a visual genius.

The cast are fantastic.  We see no less than four great Doctor Who companions - the Brigadier, Corporal Benton, Jamie and Zoe.  All get a chance to shine.  For once, Zoe is brilliant and capable instead of screaming and helpless (and see if you can spot the soldier checking her out in the catsuit at the end of episode 7). We also get the lovely Isobel Watkins, who could have . . . and probably should have . . . joined the TARDIS crew. Some reviewers have complained that the Cybermen aren't seen a lot.  That's actually a bonus because it focuses the story on Tobias Vaughn - a splendid villain played wonderfully by Kevin Stoney.  It invests more effort in suspense and veiled danger before exploding in the final episodes.

The DVD is great.  The audio and video are clean and crisp - better than they would have been in 1968. The commentaries are, for once, quite good.  The cast clearly enjoyed working on the series despite the hectic schedule and joke around and swap stories.  The extras show how the story was restored. And the animation!  I was nervous when I heard that the missing episodes were being restored with Flash animation.  But now I can't wait until they get around to the other 106 missing episodes.  It's distinctive, entrancing but still consistent with the rest of the serial. I was grinning inanely by the end of it.

You won't regret buying this.  The Invasion is an investment of both time and money -- I recommend watching it over two nights.  But it's a thrill.",1174435200,2,2866,4.603550295857988

I was transfixed.  The animation did not detract much from the feel of the show during the Troughton years.  Certainly it would have been nice to have seen the original episodes but Cosgrove-Hall did a respectible job maintaining the whole atmosphere of Doctor Who.

The DVD extras were a fascinating insight into the animation process and how fandom really keeps the show alive (the piece about the fans who taped the old TV shows).  Most of the key actors of this particular serial were still alive 40 years later to be able to discuss their fond memories of the story and that always adds a nice effect.",1173830400,3,871,4.474683544303797
685676,3,6303482619,"I always wondered why so many writers, producers, and Doctor Who staff hated the Cybermen.  Seeing TOMB, and MOONBASE, and the odd surviving episodes of Cyberman stories you would think they are really pretty cool.  But, this was the story that really put the nail in their coffin for years to come.  They came back for a quick stop with the rather lackluster 'Revenge' 6 years later and then were packed away for a further 7 years for a reason.  That reason is painfully obvious in this story, and in most all Cybermen stories.

This season and the next had a serious problem with long stories, and boring stories.  'Invasion' is extremely drawn out, pointless and boring.  Much of the logic to scenes or sequences in lost as this story, like so many of the longer stories, becomes a 'Tale of Two Rooms'.  You find the same basic malaise in 'Inferno', 'Ambassadors', 'Silurians', 'Seeds of Doom' and 'War Games'.  'Inferno' and 'Invasion' were elevated by the action direction of Douglas Camfield, and thus apt for being early DVD releases.

My big curiosity was wondering why this was billed as a cyberman story at all??  You almost NEVER see cybermen!  You see some cyber controller device in a closet.  That's not a cyberman.  You see lots of people going back and forth through buildings.  Those aren't cybermen.  And aside from a quick skirmish in the sewers the cybermen never really appear until the last two episodes, and even then they aren't really more then mute robots walking about.  If Camfield hadn't taken shots of the Cybermen against St. Paul's Cathedral, this story would have vanished from everyone's minds.

As usual, Troughton and Hines are the saviors of these flagging episodes.  And naturally the beauty of Wendy Padbury's tight little butt in a sparkling cat suit doesn't hinder charm.  Seeing Courtney as Brig. and Levene as Benton is familiar and warming.  Aside from that it's a real bore.

Commentary is wonderful.  The two animated episodes are pretty awesome to visually 'restore' the film, but sadly don't give the energy to Troughton's voice performance behind the lack of movement.  But, that's the nature of the material and budget.  Hopefully they do more animated episodes to complete some of the missing stories.

685677,5,6303482619,"Or at least that's how Tobias Vaughn, managing director of International Electronics, sees things, and as this storyline's chief villain he'd be more than happy to apply his own administrative experience to granting order, coordination, and uniformity to this sorry mess of a world--all with a little help from his cybernetic, um, allies? masters? pawns?

The ""Invasion"" is really quite a masterpiece. It's got it all. There's the Doctor, as portrayed by Patrick Troughton, seeming to bumble about absent-mindedly but with a surefire method to his (immensely amusing) goofiness. There's the great chemistry with his companions Jamie and Zoe, the latter of whom especially gets a chance to shine in this storyline--after all, she was shunned and regarded as a freak for her mathematical genius and computational skills when we first met her in ""The Wheel in Space,"" but now those same skills help save the day and win her the flirtatious accolades of the soldier boys of UNIT (and rightfully so, I might add!). Speaking of which, there's the Brigadier and UNIT, who here in their premier of sorts seem more believable as a real military force than in later appearances, with a little help from an actual battalion, no less. There's the Cybermen, ruthless cyborgs who were advising on the futility of resistance and assimilating way before the Borg got into the game--their cold, mechanistic homogeneity the perfect foil for the Doctor's eccentricity and suitably understated but firm belief in the importance of individuality and diversity. And then there's Tobias Vaughn, one of the best, most convincing villains in the show's history, whose ruthless yet disturbingly mirthful cruelty makes the Cybermen almost seem cozy in comparison.

The story is well-written and tight, longer than average (consisting as it does of eight episodes) but seeming to flow right along at a brisk pace; everything seems pretty much integral to the plot, moving it right along to its culmination. The directing is very dynamic and full of arresting visuals, some of which are stunningly iconic images that brand themselves into your mind's eye with a vengeance. A bezerker Cyberman running and flailing madly through the subterranean sewers of London makes for a particularly nightmarish example. And surely the deservedly classic shot of the Cybermen marching forwards with Saint Paul's Cathedral in the background takes the cake. Like the Daleks, the Cybermen just seem that much more sinister when they are placed in a recognizable context and carry out their nefarious designs with London landmarks and pubs in the background. And this works especially well when that landmark is a symbol of a nation's particular cultural history along with its ethical and religious values--the deepest, most profound, and most irreplaceable things we stand to loose if the Cybermen's invasion were to succeed. Not to mention the juxtaposition just looks wickedly cool.

Speaking of visuals, a lot of work has gone into presenting this masterpiece on DVD. Besides the usual fine and professional remastering and such, two of the episodes (one and four) were tragically lost and have been meticulously and creatively reconstructed here by combining animation with the audiotracks as tape-recorded off of TV by early fans and cleaned up remarkably. The animation itself is superb, wonderfully rendered and blending with the other episodes as seamlessly as humanly possible; stylized of course in a pleasingly artistic manner, but designed so as to have the look and feel of the rest of the show. It'd be great to have the originals, of course, but this is definitely second best--in fact, the animated sequences had a certain compelling charm of their own and I found myself wanting to see more.

No matter how you look at it, then, ""The Invasion"" stands tall as a major high point in the ""Doctor Who"" saga. Resistance is useless. Get it and enjoy!",1173830400,3,3917,5.154088050314465

685738,5,6303482619,"A slightly mis-matched pair of releases from the Doctor Who vaults comes our way from the BBC. The Invasion, an epic 8 part story from 1968 made in glorious black and white  - at the time the second longest story yet made - and a brief two-parter, The Sontaran Experiment, squeezed in from 1975. But there's a lot to enjoy here to celebrate the classic era of the show.

The Invasion stars Patrick Troughton as the second Doctor, featuring in a format that set the stage for his successor Jon Pertwee's tenure in the role. After the success of the Web of Fear a year earlier, when Yeti invaded the London Underground and the Doctor helped the British military contain the threat, the production team set about creating another London/alien invasion story, with the military presence expanded to a fictional international force known as UNIT. They brought back the same character and actor from the Yeti story to lead this force, promoted him to Brigadier and thus launched one of the most popular and enduring characters from the show's history.

This particular story was something of a milestone in Doctor Who history, even though it was born out of a panic to replace some rejected scripts. Not just because it created a new format for the show, but mainly for its impact on the viewing public. When the Cybermen emerged from the London sewers to enslave the human race, marching inexorably down the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral, the impact on the psyche of the British children watching was enormous. I know I was not alone in avoiding all sewer manhole covers for years to come! Alas, episodes 1 & 4 were junked by the BBC in 1971 and the remaining 6 were of poor quality tele-recordings. Inadequate linking material, intended to bridge the gaps, was recorded by Nicholas Courtney - The Brigadier - for the 1993 VHS release, but now the brilliant boys at Cosgrove Hall have replaced the two missing episodes in their entirety with animated recreations of the missing footage. I wasn't sure at first about the concept, but all doubts were dispelled as it is so brilliantly executed. Using the original soundtrack, the animation has been recreated perfectly and fills the void wonderfully.

Apart from the animation and phenomenal restoration work, there are many extra features describing the animation concept, process and restoration, as well as an in depth feature on the making of the programme and the era in general. The care and love that went into making these two episodes is evident. It thus seems almost churlish - and certainly geeky - to make any criticism, but there is one error which is almost unforgivable! The animators have given the Doctor's assistant Zoe the wrong costume in the early part of episode 1! It would have been an easy mistake to make, except that the previous episode (which runs immediately into this story) does exist and photos from episode 1 are abundant. They've drawn her with the costume she adopts about mid-way through the first episode. For all their attention to detail, it seems a very basic error to have made.

The commentary from Frazer Hines (Jamie), Wendy Padbury (Zoe) and Nicholas Courtney for the six live action episodes is very entertaining, as is the one from the animators and restoration team for the two missing episodes. But I wish they'd have included Derrick Sherwin, the script editor, eventual producer, creator of the UNIT format and author of this particular tale. Much as I like hearing the Brigadier, he does get used rather often on the Doctor Who commentaries. A minor quibble.

With all of these extras and goodies, it's a shame to compare the relatively thin co-release, The Sontaran Experiment. A two part adventure from Tom Baker's first season in the role of Doctor number four, this very short story really belongs as a tag-team with the preceding four-part adventure, The Ark in Space. It's really using all the location and outside broadcast allocation that didn't get used in the studio based Ark story. By releasing it alone, I think the BBC are stretching fan's patience just a tiny bit, but they have at least included a very well made documentary on the history and evolution of the Sontarans and there's a great commentary soundtrack too. Seems a bit much to shell out $13 for two episodes, but as a fan, I'm just glad to have them in my library. As the first story ever made to be made entirely on location and entirely on video tape, it's an interesting milestone in the Doctor Who evolution.

A good pair of releases. One probably too long and one probably too short, but together forming another great pair of entries into the Doctor Who DVD collection.",1173225600,6,4648,4.795255930087391
685739,5,6303482619,"It was a shock to see an incomplete story... made complete via animation?!

The highlight of this story is the background history and what transpired to make this 'missing' story into a released DVD set.

The sixth season of the show (1968-1969) had a lot of scripts falling through.  As a result, commissioned stories had to be stretched out longer. ""The Invasion"" is one such story.  The good news is, the gravitas of the character and performance of the actor (Kevin Stoney) playing Tobias Vaughn helps elevate this story and keeps it moving.  The story is essentially him vs the Doctor, with Tobias attempting to use the Cybermen to his benefit while the Doctor enlists the help of a newly formed secret paramilitary organization that battles alien invaders; UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce).

I would say episodes 6 and 7 do drag on a bit, but there are plenty of set pieces that re-awaken you at the right times.

As usual, sound and video for a program made in this time are sensational.  And the extras and commentaries made by still-living cast and crew alone pay for this story; and then we get the story itself...

Here's the rundown:  In the 1970s, the BBC junked many programs from its archives.  The Patrick Troughton era of ""Doctor Who"" was badly hit.  As a result, most of his stories have been destroyed.

Fortunately, over the years, episodes are found in warehouses, returned to the BBC by countries who bought licenses to air the old episodes during the 1960s and never junked the films themselves, or returned by collectors - who are far more philanthropic than many we'd otherwise give the title to.

Additionally, during the 1960s, home video recorders didn't exist.  (Another 12 years would pass before the technology became feasible... or popular.)  So people recorded them onto audio tape, often by dangling a microphone in front of the TV set.

As part of the restoration process (and having seen many VHS copies, some work had to be done), the end result of episodes 2, 3, and 5-8 are marvelous.  And this is the first professionally released version of the story where all the Cybermens' dialogue can be heard distinctly, with full clarity.  The previous releases I've seen just didn't have the cleanup applied and the difference is PHENOMENAL.

But the icing is on the cake:  Episodes 1 and 4 have been re-created via cleaning and amalgamating numerous audio tape sources, with animation applied.  And the animation is spectacular.  It doesn't steal any opportunities to go ""over the top"", there is a genuine sense of the animators trying to be true to the original footage as possible (though some embellishments are inevitable; the master tapes and films nonexisting).  It's very clever, grabs your attention, doesn't seem at all shoehorned in, and the audio quality is spectacular.  The extras go into the history of program junking, how audiotracks were recovered, and a well made piece on how they were cleaned - I don't want to spoil it here, but as with the main story, there is not one piece of extra that does NOT entertain or edify!

Sadly the animation itself is not outstanding, especially in respect to facial expression and emotion, but the important thing is that some effort has been made to present these missing episodes. For many this will be the first opportunity to watch this story and I think that most Doctor Who fans will enjoy it immeasurably. It is certainly overlong and I have always felt that any story that exceeds 4 or 5 episodes has a fair amount of padding. There is a lot of repetitive chase scenes and lots of locking up and escapes. But the trump card are the Cybermen themselves, who have a truly chilling and iconic presence in the story. Also impressive is the performance of Kevin Stoney as Tobias Vaughan, a technology obsessed capitalist with dreams of global dominion. Unfortunately for him is ego and arrogance are his undoing. Naturally in a story of many narrative stands, Jamie and Zoe don't have a lot too do, but Patrick Troughton compensates with a typically charming performance. The DVD itself is packed with supplementary materials and most importantly the picture and audio quality is outstanding.",1169251200,9,1695,4.971830985915493
685741,5,6303482619,"I had the good fortune this week to view the newly released DVD set from BBC of the great Doctor Who adventure, The Invasion, with the two ""missing"" episodes animated by Cosgrove Hall - amd I'm delighted to report, it is fantastic!  As many Who fans will have seen the (rather poor quality) VHS of some years ago for this riveting story, I'll turn right to the restored Episodes 1 and 4.  How good a job did the animators at Cosgrove Hall do?  A very good job indeed.  Turning to the animated versions of the characters themselves, the portrayal of Zoe is amazingly faithful to Wendy Padbury's original, with all of her subtle facial expressions and visual personality intact.  And what a fine actress she is!  The Jamie recreation, while certainly recognizable, is not quite as successful - he must have a more difficult face to render.  As for the great Patrick Troughton himself, well, for the most part the animated version is a near-perfect recreation of my favorite of all the Doctors (or perhaps it's a tie with Tom Baker);  at some angles, though, particularly when the Doctor is looking upward, the animated character looks a bit like George Washington coping painfully with his wooden dentures.  It's true.  Minor quibbles aside, though, quite a glorious reconstruction of these missing episodes.  Also excellent are the animated alter egos of the supporting characters, including the villain Tobias Vaughn (but for some reason, without his lazy right eye in the animated version, a physical trait that adds to the character's menace).  The animated action sequences are always excellent, with a particularly convincing cow in Episode 1, staring in through the TARDIS window.  Giving nothing away, the first few moments of Episode 1 involve a missle being fired at the just-reassembled TARDIS (Invasion followed Mind Robber in sequence), and this and the other special effects probably look considerably better, less budget-constrained, than in the lost originals.  As for monsters, there aren't any in Episodes 1 and 4, until the last few moments of Episode 4, where they make a most dramatic appearance, not to be missed by any Who fan.  What a perfectly wonderful way to recreate this masterpiece.  I enjoy the telesnap-based recons a great deal, but clearly animation is the way to go with these missing episodes.  A triumph!  And if we're very very lucky, this might be the harbinger of things to come from BBC/Cosgrove Hall.  The bulk of the Second Doctor's episodes are ""missing from the BBC archives,"" and likely to remain so, barring the opening of some Middle Eastern film library or mad collector's shelves.  These include some of the very finest, most well plotted and superbly acted stories in the entire series:  Fury from the Deep, Macra Terror, Power of the Daleks, Evil of the Daleks, the two Yeti stories, and much more.  Obvious follow up projects would include the Tenth Planet, Ice Warriors, and Moonbase, which are reasonably close to being complete in the archives.  Some of these stories, and particularly the monsters and other special effects, may actually benefit from being animated - given the budgetary constraints imposed on Doctor Who in this early time period, the monsters aren't always as convincing as they might be (part of the charm of the series, I recognize).
Reserve your advance copy of this lost masterpiece today!  Support this glorious and thoroughly successful breakthrough.  And join in the hope that The Invasion will signal a new era for Patrick Troughton, the greatest Doctor of all!  (Now how about the First Doctor's Marco Polo, or Dalek Master Plan . . .?)",1165017600,28,3619,4.970099667774086
685742,5,6303482619,"The Invasion is significant in three aspects.  One, it introduces UNIT, United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, which was founded four years after the Yeti invasion in the sadly no-longer extant story The Web Of Fear.  Two, it further establishes Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart as an important character in the Dr. Who mythos.  Three, the Cybermen in this story are the first to sport the trademark handlebars sprouting on either side of their earmuff-motif heads.
The Doctor and Jamie are reunited with Lethbridge-Stewart, now promoted to brigadier, who are keeping an eye on International Electromatics, a major player in supplying computer circuits to the world--a 60's version of Intel, if you will.  They're interested in people who enter the IE building and either vanish or come out different.  UNIT HQ is a Hercules cargo plane in this story, which is kind of unconventional but neat.
They also meet Isobel Watkins, the daughter of a professor who is one of the vanished people.  She's a fun, perky, 60's Mary Quant dolly bird who does modelling and photography.  She and Zoe form a rapport together.  However, she is independent-minded, and she reacts to the Brigadier's male chauvinism by saying, ""Oh, you... you man!""
Tobias Vaughn, head of IE, is a smooth and suave mastermind for the most part, but the incompetence of his head security goon Packer, who has a violent streak causes him to abandon his usual calm.  His plan is to aim somewhat higher than controlling the entire electronics industry.
Zoe really has some great moments in this story.  She has fun giving IE's computer an insoluble Algol equation.  In the final episode, she puts her math skills at the Henlow Downs missile center.  As one of the men puts it, ""Can't we keep her?  She's so much prettier than a computer?""  In Episode Six, she also puts on the glittering black catsuit she wore in The Mind Robber.
The end to Episode 6 is immortal, as the Cybermen overturn sewer covers and walk down the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral in formation, the swirling otherwordly buzz of the Cyber hypnotic device sounding in the background.  Another is Vaughn calling for Packer.  A Cybermen appears in the monitor in response, a jarring chord sounding as it does.
This eight-parter has two episodes, 1 and 4 missing.  The missing bits are narrated by Nicholas Courtney (the Brigadier), sitting in a chair in a Masterpiece Theatre type room, and even having a large volume in his lap, and briefly filling in the gaps.  This story was also directed by the late Douglas Camfield, a very demanding field-marshal type person who also directed the Jon Pertwee story Inferno.  Both stories feature his wife Sheila Dunn, who is the IE computer voice here--in Inferno, she plays Petra Williams.
Kevin Stoney (Tobias Vaughn) is a smooth and a somewhat plummy villain, quite a change from Dalek Master Plan's Fu-Manchu-like Mavic Chen.  Extra kudos to Sally Faulkner for making Isobel such a lovable character.  Why didn't she make a reappearance in another story?  And seeing an incognito Corporal Benton (he would be Sergeant later) at the beginning of Episode 2 should bring a jolt of recognition to fans.  This was John Levene's debut story, heralding a recurring role that would last until The Android Invasion (1975).
Equal parts action, James Bond-type thriller, extraterrestrials invading earth story, and with the atmosphere of a military operation, The Invasion, despite its missing episodes, is one of the best Who stories.",1057104000,12,3491,5.012131715771231
685743,5,6303482619,"I kinda relegate this story, which is a great adventure of course, as being 'The Cybermen's Master Plan', in which there are slight parallels between this and what the Daleks were up to as well during the William Hartnell era. Even though, the Cybermen were only concerned with conquering Earth, not necessarily the entire universe. But with that aside, this is a truly gripping and awesome adventure, which also marks the return of Lethbridge-Stewart, this time a Brigadier, and placed in charge of UNIT, the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. It was also great to see not just the Cybermen again, but the gentleman who portrayed Mavic Chen in the Daleks' Masterplan, portraying Tobias Vaughn, who is an equally dispicable, Chen-like villain this time around as well.  And the scene where it is demonstrated how they would keep the Cybermen in line, but actually introducing emotions into their cybernetic systems is frightening.  an extremely well done adventure, highly recommended.",1039651200,,989,5.253164556962025

685745,5,6303482619,"This story of the second Doctor is another of the stories to feature an invasion of the Earth or, more correctly, of London.
Ostensibly the story involves the Doctor and Zoe visiting his old Yeti friend, Dr. Travis only to find his tenant's niece whose uncle has disappeared.
The adventure unfolds in two directions, that of the fear of all of the computers in the world linking up and enslaving humanity and also the reappearance of the Doctor's old foes, the Cybermen.
The first of these strands was a common theme in the 1960's and in this case also reflects the fear of the emergence of a monopoly which was not government controlled in a field of strategic or national importance.
Combine that with the inhuman Vaughn, surely one of the Doctor's most inhuman, human villains, and his alliance with the Cybermen on the promise of control of earth and you have a very strong plot indeed. There are some good outside shots here also, presaging the Pertwee years and there is another bonus with the setting of the invasion in London.
The National Tourist Board could not have done a better job with the Cybermen sweeing through the East End of London with the backdrop of St. Paul's Cathedral. Taken together with the dolly bird images of Zoe and Isobel which highlighted the modern role of London as the Swinging Capital of the world and you get a marketing person's dream.
This story has Patrick Troughton also at his strongest in a rousing performance which almost has you cheering.
All in all a great story which really ought to be one of the first on DVD.",1034121600,3,1561,4.6389891696750905
685746,5,6303482619,"Although the loss of a few  episodes, this is a good story. Nicholas Courtney (Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart) talks about the episodes that had been lost and gives you an idea on what happened. It's a long story , originally an 8 episode story that deals with the Cybermen, and it is REMARKABLE how these aliens changed throughout  the years. First they didn't speak very clearly and as the years went by their speech improved. But this is a good one if you are a fan of Patrick Troughton or the Cybermen, and the companions are Zoe and Jamie, and Brigadier and Benton also star in it. The Doctor has to stop the Cybermen from invading Earth as usual and it goes on from  there.",991958400,,677,4.443548387096774

The first six seasons of the original Doctor Who series are incomplete, as many stories are entirely missing, or have some episodes missing, which means that until recently, even these stories could not be enjoyed.  However, the Patrick Troughton story, The Invasion, which is missing episodes 1 and 4, have been restored through the use of audio recordings of the show from fans of the series and animated by Cosgrove Hall Studios.  The Cybermen were always my favorite enemy of the Doctor, and this was the best story of the Patrick Troughton era.",1478131200,,643,4.8807339449541285
7850841,4,6303482619,"It's nice that this serial has been reconstructed, even if a couple episodes had to be animated.  As always, rather than just attack a technologically inferior enemy, the cybermen must come out up with a super complicated attack plan that is bound to fail.  Despite having a powerful spaceship that can zip from the far side of the moon to 50,000 miles from earth in an instant, they can't move out of the way of a slow moving 1960s vintage  earth rocket.  Still, the interactions between the Doctor and Vaughn(who collaborates with the cybermen intending to betray them and take over the world himself) are highly amusing.  It's nice to have this serial back in some form.  Also, this is the first appearance of UNIT and the second of Lethbridge-Stewart, recurring participants in the series over the next several years.",1464825600,2,821,4.828571428571428
7850842,5,6303482619,"This is a fantastic story. Casting Kevin Stoney as Tobias Vaughn was perfect. In addition you have the introduction of UNIT as well as Cybermen. The acting and story were very well done and Douglas Camfield's direction was spot on.

Episodes 1 & 4 are animated and use the original soundtrack. I thought the animation was well done although I felt the animation for the stories The Moonbase and The Ice Warriors was just a bit better.

It is definitely worth getting this story for your collection. It can get pricey for region 1 so I suggest getting the less expensive region 2 if you have a region free DVD player.",1434672000,,616,4.54054054054054
