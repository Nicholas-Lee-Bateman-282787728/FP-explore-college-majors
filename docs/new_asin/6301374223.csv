327968,4,6301374223,"This is a warm, witty, ingratiating film that many viewers can identify with. It's about two not particularly compatible people (Pete and Tillie) who meet, marry, have a child, then attempt to make sense of each other and their unhappy marriage. They become strangers, torn apart as much by his marital infidelities as by their opposite outlooks on life. After ten years of a very shaky domestic situation they face one of the worst parental nightmares imaginable - the loss of their child to a terminal illness. The maddening pain of this event brings them together but, at the same time, highlights their very different philosophical attitudes. Walter Matthau in the role of the cynical, non-religious, philandering husband is given the wittier lines in the script which he spuns with impeccable timing and perfect ironic intonation.  Carol Burnett plays the soul-searching, self-agonizing wife who needs to find the meaning of her son's death. Was it divine retribution? Some viewers feel that Matthau and Burnett deadpan their way through the entire movie. Their response very likely stems from having anticipated an uproarious domestic situation-comedy (something like an ""I Love Carol""), which this film is definitely not. With the notable exception of one hilarious scene in which Tillie and a bitchy friend (played to comic perfection by Geraldine Page) have a brawl, this is essentially a tragi-comedy. Moreover, the two super charismatic stars of the movie empty themselves to play their rather ordinary characters with straightforward, self-effacing honesty. By 1972, when this film was released, Matthau was a celebrated oscar-winning screen character actor. However, Burnett's transformation from the slapstick queen of TV variety shows to the fine dramatic actress of subtlety and detail seen here is astonishing. Some critics and viewers were not prepared for it but quite frankly that was their problem, not hers. Burnett delivers a tearful scene (in which Tillie vents all of her anger at God and the Virgin Mary) with overwhelming conviction, yet her acting remains beautifully controlled. It is the most deeply affecting moment in the movie, one that will haunt viewers long after the end credits have passed. ""Pete 'n' Tillie"" was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Screenplay.",1013904000,22,2314,5.33972602739726
327969,2,6301374223,"Pete 'N' Tillie is a film without focus or a main point.  It tells the story of a 33 year old woman (Burnett) who enters marriage with an man who is a charming rascal who loathes religion and is unable to remain faithful.  Through a series of what seem more like vignettes than a viable plot, the  ""story"" is developed where Pete and Tillie marry, conceive a  child and establish a marriage where Pete is merely a visitor--that is he  is not an inspired husband.  The couple do love their child and it is this  child who keeps them together.  The child dies and the marriage falls  apart.  In the end, however, Pete realizes that he wants to stay with  Tillie, perhaps he loves her--the viewer certainly can deduct this from the  film's last scene but perhaps they stay together more for custom than  anything else.  Who knows?  At best, the film just rambles on through some  scenes where the acting is unispired.  Matthau and especially Burnett  deadpan their way through their scenes.  The only relief in this tedious  film is the late Geraldine Page.  Her Gertrude Wilson exudes class as well  as crass.  Even though Page's character has ""money"", she is still  base and when called upon can be very bitchy.  The highlight of her  performance is where she is faced with having to reveal her true age.  Watching Page hammer and haw is a delight.  There is one distrubing scene  and a shining moment for Burnett:  Her anger at God and at the Virgin Mary  for ""killing her son"" is both startling and distrubing.  The  Burnett character calls God a butcher and spits at the Virgin Mary.  Burnett plays this scene with conviction; however, her subsequent voice  over where she voices her regret for blaspheming both God and Mary is not  that convicing.  She goes back to her deadpan delivery. While this film  does have its rare moments of joy (especially when the Page character  appears)overall, the film is a disappointment.  It is unfocused and the  acting of both Matthau and Burnett is tedious, unspired and banal.  Too  bad: with different actors, the story of these two distaff and older people  finding love at the end could have been one dynamite film.",960163200,2,2160,4.660427807486631
327970,3,6301374223,"It was rather amazing to see Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett deadpan most of the time.  There was a strong undercurrent of cynicism in human relationships.  Burnett is homely and gives up on marriage till the intense  womanizer, Matthau puts the make on her.  She surrenders and finds she  enjoys sex, despite her having been brought up as a Catholic.  She called  him a 'pistol'.  When she was undressing for the first time in her bedroom  she said like she was preparing herself for surgery.  He responded that her  silken underthings were falling in surrender.  He, among other things, was  a poet with an ever wry sense of humor.  The flic looked like the 50's,  despite its coming out in 1972.  It is not great, but very good.",915494400,2,732,4.6015625

Both Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett turned in masterful, albeit low key performances.  This is one that should stick in your memory for reasons of sheer simplistic beauty.  Finally, the physical fight between Carol and Geraldine Page is a classic unto itself.",1418774400,,390,4.776119402985074
328014,5,6301374223,"This remains one of my husband and my favorite movies from over the years. Can't beat the combo of Carol Burnett and Walter Mattheau. The situations in the movie are ""Real to life!"" And don't we just love the way they deal with life's twists and turns! HAd to include a copy of this movie in our own library of favorites so that when life seems to take a tough turn, the movie can be popped into the player, and Mattheau's naked bum at the piano bench can bring a smile!",1414540800,,470,4.175824175824176

328017,3,6301374223,"All I can say is it is a 70s movie...maybe late 60s which all have their own ""soap operish"" quality but the acting is good. Carol Burnett has one very memorable moment of dramatic acting...she was good.",1389398400,,202,4.486486486486487
328018,4,6301374223,"Pete (Walter Matthau) is generally uncouth and a bit of a scoundrel.  Tillie(Carol Burnett) is prim and reserved.  What they share is a world weariness, cynicism, and a love for engaging in verbal one-upmanship.  Is this enough to sustain a lasting relationship?  ""Pete 'n' Tillie"" isn't a perfect film by no stretch of the means.  Though witty Julius J. Epstein's script seems self consciously so and suffers from a bit of a stagy feel.  The film veers toward the melodramatic in spots but director Martin Ritt steers the film from being maudlin.  The saving grace here are the performances none less so than Burnett.  Known predominantly for her wildly popular and innovative TV variety show Burnett here is a revelation.  In a powerhouse turn Burnett subtly suggests the changes in Tillie from shy spinster to grieving mother. Also noteworthy is the bit by Geraldine Page as Gertrude, Tillie's friend.  The apoplexy that Page demonstrates when asked her age at a police station is classic and probably sealed her the nomination for a supporting actress Oscar.  Can't overlook Tillie's classic query ""Honeymoon's over, Pete.  When are we getting married?""",1379808000,,1157,5.095744680851064

328030,4,6301374223,nice and entertaining movie that was kind of forgotten in the anals of great veteran actors.i had known this movie had been made.but never had the opportunity to ever view it before now.it was very interesting to see carol burnette in a non comedy role while still at a very young age in life.a great acting job on both parts.,1374278400,,326,4.45
328031,5,6301374223,I loved this movie when it came out in the 70's and was so happy to watch it again.  Walther Matthau is one of my favorite actors and doesn't fail to show this here too.  Carol is also a really good actress.  The story line is so true to the way things were back in the 70's.,1370908800,,275,3.789473684210526
328032,5,6301374223,I have fond memories of this movie. My dad was probably one of the first buyers of a video tape machine. This was one of the first movies we taped. We loved watching it as a family. It's got great performances by Carole Burnette and Walter Matthau. Geraldine Page is superb too. Love this movie and it's great to have a copy I can watch whenever I want. Don't miss this one! (Great soundtrack too).,1356998400,3,398,4.32
328033,5,6301374223,"Carol Burnett joins Walter Matthau in this love story of a 30ish year old woman who falls for an older casanova.  She gives the relationship her all, he reaps and enjoys the benefits that come his way.  This movie was made when Ms. Burnett was being hailed as the queen of comedy.  Her variety show was a big success and eventhough this film is quite dramatic, Carol is delightful, and warm in her performance of Tillie.  I was thrilled to finally see it's release on DVD.  I truly recommend everyone see this movie.",1354406400,3,516,4.505376344086022

328038,4,6301374223,"This is a movie that NEEDS to be in DVD.  Carol Burnett stretches her acting wings and I don't think Walter Matthau has ever been better.  They are given a great supporting cast and a rather complex set of plot lines to weave and do so entertainingly.  It's not that you'll say ""WOW"" at the end.  It's just that you'll feel sad, happy, and satisfied all at the same time.

PLEASE Studio execs; are you listening?  Can't you transfer this and sell it for $10.99 like the umpteenth version of Stripes?",1256601600,6,499,4.428571428571429
328039,4,6301374223,"I was expecting not to like this and it had the opposite effect.  I enjoyed seeing Mr. Matthau's bottom and hirsute chest.  I'm so used to seeing Ms. Burnett in comedies and being extraverted.  Here, she plays drama/tragedy well and this is a breath of fresh air for her repertoire.  I really think that this movie may have influenced ""Igby Goes Down.""  Many a modern indie film depends on characters that spew witty lines in order to hide their true feelings.  This was profound art and really deserved to win all the awards it did.  There's all this praise going to ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Prince of Tides,"" yet in all these years I had heard nothing about this gem.  What a shame!  I highly recommend it.",1187136000,,709,4.519685039370079
