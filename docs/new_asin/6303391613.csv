7845174,3,6303391613,"This is better then the other 2 I reviewed last year. The Lex Luger-Tatanka rematch was much better then thier SummerSlam bout:both wrestling & entertainment wise. The Bret Hart-Owen Hart-Cage Match for the WWF title while a great match,it's clipped in this tape. The other 2 are forgettable at best. Overall.it's not great but pretty good. I give this tape a 6 out of 10.",1325548800,,372,4.7384615384615385

This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWF Off the Top Rope
This was just another old tape I found out of luck. There aren't really any great matches on here, besides Bret Hart VS Owen Hart. The rest of the matches are standard Raw matches. Considering how rare some of these matches are, this isn't such a bad find. Still, on the wrestling side of things this leaves much to be desired. Ted Dibiase hosts the video. You also get tips and cheats from three video games.

Yokozuna VS Adam Bomb (Raw is War)
This is probably the strongest Raw match on this tape. Adam Bomb tries extremely hard to knock down Yokozuna. Eventually he prevails with a DDT. Interference at the end of the match actually adds to the match for me. Oddly enough, this one ends in a count out though. A short match, but a solid encounter.
RATING- 6.5/10

British Bulldog VS Jim ""Anvil"" Neidhart (Raw is War)
This match was the debut for British Bulldog on Raw. The match is a power contest, but Anvil quickly gets the advantage and dominates the match. There is a clipped out portion of the match, but it's not much. A disqualification finish hurts the match.
RATING- 4/10

Steel Cage Match (Summerslam 1994) (Match of the VHS)
WWF Championship
Bret Hart(c) VS Owen Hart
This is widely considered one of the greatest Steel Cage Matches of all time. I agree this match is awesome. Brother VS Brother plays out very well, as they are each trying to get a quick victory. The match is edited, but you only miss a small portion of the match.
RATING- 8.5/10

Lex Luger VS Tatanka (Raw is War)
This was another average Raw match. The match begins with Luger chasing Tatanka around the ring. Once the match begins, Tatanka dominates Luger. The match is that way for a while. Then there is a clipped section and Luger is gaining momentum again. Yet another bad finish with a double count out. I loved the aftermath though.

7845176,4,6303391613,"This video was pretty good for what they did back then. They have some good matches put together for this tape, so here they are:

match 1 7/25/94-Yokozuna vs Adam Bomb this match was from an edition of Monday Night RAW just a typical big man match that sees interference from Kwang. 5.5/10

match 2 10/3/94-The Anvil vs British Bulldog this was another from a Monday Night RAW which was Bulldogs first match in WWF since leaving the company in December 1992. Again just another typical match with interference from Bret and Owen. 5.5/10

match 3 8/29/94-Bret vs Owen this was the steel cage match from SS 94 but some of the match was edited but most was shown. It leaves out the post match attack and about 4 minutes of the match. But its a one hour video, what do you expect. 9/10

match 4 9/1/94-Lex Luger vs Tatanka this was actually an alright match much better than the SS 94 match, this was a Coliseum Video exclusive which is very rare footage. Could have been alot better, though 7/10

If you can find this for less than maybe $1.00, I would recommend it.",1170028800,2,1064,4.435897435897436
