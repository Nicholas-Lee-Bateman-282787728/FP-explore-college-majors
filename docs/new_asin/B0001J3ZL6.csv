2011999,5,B0001J3ZL6,"This film is great for its time 1977.. I had the hots for Richard Hatch who latterly was in Battle star Galacticca.. The music is typical of California Mid 60'S Surfers BeachBoys and babes beach lovers..
My Mother was an extra in the Film at the end she was just one of the audience but how lucky was she and yes I can pick her out on film... She was given a double album OF THE BEATLES love Songs.. and the stars of the Film Autographed the inside for her ..I still have it today.. I missed the opportunity to go to this Grrr!

My Mum is not with us now gone in 1997 so it's more of a gem to me to see live footage of her in a Great Fun Film...",1307232000,,645,3.8496240601503757

2012001,5,B0001J3ZL6,I first saw this movie on HBO in 1979 and have loved it ever since. I cannot believe it is so rare and not on DVD. Richard Hatch was mis-cast as Jan Berry. Film was otherwise very well done. Jan Berry was a genius. I believe he was a member of the MENSA society.  Jan should be admired for the way he fought back and was able to move on with his life & career despite being so disabled.,1238457600,3,386,3.8860759493670884
2012002,5,B0001J3ZL6,"This rare video of ""Deadmans's Curve - The Jan & Dean Story,"" aired on TV only once in 1978, is excellent!  I had been looking for this for a long time and was thrilled to finally find it!  My copy, though used, was in excellent shape - both the movie and the jacket sleeve. It tells the story of Jan & Dean's rise to success and fame, Jan's accident, his struggle to regain motor skills, Dean's loyalty to his friend and music partner, and Jan's emotional come-back on stage.  I love it!",1233792000,5,488,4.282608695652174
2012003,5,B0001J3ZL6,This is one of my favorite true movie that I like so much. I never knew what the effects that was going on after Jan had that terrified accident,1204156800,2,144,4.0
2012004,5,B0001J3ZL6,"I had looked so long for this movie and when I got it it was worth the wait. I have never enjoyed something so much as this. Richard Hatch who is one of the masters of acting in my opinion is phenomenal in this movie as Jan Berry. He is so 180 from the high maitnence Jan. Bruce Davison was also quite excellent as Dean Torrence. I enjoy his works very much as well-besides these two dedicated excellent actors-Susan DuBarry who played Jan's Girlfriend through the majority of the movie was 1st rate.

Pamela Bellwood also deserves two thumbs as Annie. All of these actors made these people quite believable.

I enjoyed this -I reccomend this to anyone.

2012005,5,B0001J3ZL6,I watched this movie 25 years ago and I just loved it that I even cried through some of the seans in the movie.,1080259200,6,111,3.6666666666666665
8013997,1,B0001J3ZL6,"My rating is for the Interglobal Home Video release.  This is my second experience with a tape from them and they have to have the worst quality control and durability that I have ever seen in VHS.  Movie skips to glitched areas throughout as others have said, and it sometimes loses it's LP speed for SP.  The fact that the record tab is still present is also a sign of cheap manufacturing.

Another tape title that I bought from them had it's surface disintegrate as I ran it through my machine.

Guess I'll have to look for the GEM SP recording.",1511222400,,548,4.3861386138613865
8013998,4,B0001J3ZL6,"This is a sad story of Jan and Dean's brief musical careers during the 1960s. Jan Berry is portrayed as a very immature, self-centered, insensitive, and reckless guy, which is a bit depressing to watch. The good times and the wonderful creativity are quickly sped through to get to the tragic car accident where Jan was speeding at about 80 miles per hour and foolishly weaving through the other cars before he crashed into  the back of a truck. He was often insulting his partner Dean before and after this career ending accident, which made him seem like a not very nice person.
During this movie Jan is seen cheating on all the women that came into his life, which made him seem both insensitive and shallow.
Watching this movie made me feel like Jan Berry could have easily killed someone else while he was driving and that he sort of got what he deserved for all of his stupidity. Perhaps he was an anti-hero. This movie left me feeling a little bummed out, but it's the only movie about these two 60's singers, so it's all we have movie-wise to remember them by.",1469491200,,1068,4.505154639175258

8014004,5,B0001J3ZL6,"Hatch and Davison do a nice job as singing duo Jan and Dean, who were popular in the 60s until Jan's almost fatal car crash.  Inspiring story of his recovery and redemption.",1399507200,,173,4.40625
8014005,5,B0001J3ZL6,"There's a lot of drama going on behind the scenes of those musical groups who project a relaxed, no-worries facade to the public. Strong, believable acting in a storyline that holds your interest throughout and based on a true story.  Great to hear some of Jan & Dean's classics and be musically transported to the California of yesteryear!",1388102400,,340,4.862068965517241
8014006,4,B0001J3ZL6,"Deadmans Curve, 1978 film

In the early to mid 1960's Jan Berry and Dean Torrence were a popular singing team who wrote their own songs. They were contemporaries of The Beach Boys. They sang of the fun from fast cars and surfing on the beach. One of their friends took part in the kidnapping of the son of a famous singer. This led to their being blacklisted by Hollywood. They did not appear in Ride the Wild Surf but their song was used. Their career ended when Jan had a car crash that resulted in brain damage. Driving in a state of anger may be as dangerous as drunk driving. Jan & Dean gave a warning about Deadmans Curve. Mulholland Drive was used for drag racing, those who went off the road crashed into a ravine. Their songs were similar to advertising to sell cars (Little GTO by another group). There was nothing to make listeners think of current events (compare their songs to The Eve of Destruction).

Jan suffered from aphasia, his brain could not control his body. His career was over. He gets better over the months in a rehabilitation center. [These sad scenes are educational not entertaining.] After three years he returned home. He has a medallion to describe his condition, otherwise he could be mistaken for a common drunk. Styles in music changed in the mid-1960's. Folk-rock and other styles predominated. The Beatles and The Stones became most popular. A group of free-loaders moved in with him and took advantage of his condition. Dean visited him and saw this. Dean had a graphic design business and created album covers. Jan is still recognized. He cant write the songs he hears in his head. He can sing better than he can talk. [Note the difference in hair styles from the early 1960's.]

Most young men in America were concerned with their jobs or education, unlike the carefree lives in these songs. Few could spend days and weeks of fun in the sun, surfing and checking out the beach bunnies. Who surfed in the midwest? These seeming happy days ended for many young men with a draft notice. Stay in college, get married and have a child, or work in a defense industry were the alternatives. Some joined the Army and were sent to Germany. Were mostly young men from the big cities sent to Vietnam? If drafted, Jan & Dean could have spent their time entertaining the troops (like Jackie Cooper). Where are they now? Does any radio stations play their songs? Even the Beach Boys are obsolete. Other movies from that era are better (The Buddy Holly Story and La Bamba).",1341187200,,2499,4.61123595505618
