It differs from most pieces of its genre by exhibiting often explicit examples of the acts it demonizes.

3028137,5,B000YEBL64,"Kudos to Justine and Armande for bringing the topic of lesbian rape to the forefront.  Before watching this DVD I was like others ordering it thinking yes, girl on girl action, love it.  But when I watched the DVD it changed my thinking.  Like many interviewed in the DVD I was like how can a woman who is already gay be raped by another woman.  Plus I was like there is no penetration so how is it rape?  Watching this DVD answered that question.  When we take away our prejudices and imagine how would we feel if it were our sister, our mother, our friend it happened to it becomes real.  I love that they had professionals in the film talk about this issue as well as victims.  I will agree with one of the critiques this documentary gets and that's all women raped by women are not all lesbians, some of them are straight getting taken advantage of by being drugged or strong armed like men get raped in prison, women get raped in prison and out of it.  I watched this DVD a few years ago, but now that I am a book author revisiting the topic of lesbian rape I thought it important to add my voice.  Justine and Armande, write on, write on",1337904000,5,1143,4.225806451612903

Heck don't watch this movie tell any and everyone you see the same. The ignorance ""displayed"" if not just bad acting is dumb-founding and these interviews only acts as segways to sex scenes and I hate to say it like that rape is never a light subject but it's truly one of the worst attempts in money making and worst yet; say that some of they womens' stories are TRUE! Their horrifying experiences have been used as source material as pulp for the ""film-makers'"" ,Directors Justine Chang and Armand Kaye, profits. And the real impact lost to smut.

  But that's Not why people are going to see this movie - it features ""dramatic recreations"" of female homosexual assaults. In other words, top notch pornography. Frotage, strap-ons, face-sitting, name it, it's there. And since mainstream pornography shies away from rape fantasies these days, the producers have got themselves a near monopoly.

3028141,1,B000YEBL64,"She Stole My Voice: A Documentary About Lesbian Rape (Justine Chang and Armand Kaye, 2007)

I actually watched this a few months ago, and I've been letting it stew in my head ever since trying to figure out what to say about it. It's a movie that I feel really, really bad about panning, because the subject matter is kind of the opposite of fluffy bunnies; it's one of those things that has IMPORTANT, SERIOUS, SENSITIVE SUBJECT stamped on its forehead in big red letters. But, well, as the man once said, ""all bad poetry is sincere."" The same is true of documentaries, I guess. And, really, when it comes right down to it, the filmmakers did a great deal of the digging on the grave I'm about to push them into. Why? Because this is less a documentary than it is an exploitation flick--a number of interviews with women who have been sexually assaulted by other women intercut with (or, sometimes, used as narration for) recreations of the events, or scenes depicting the horror of lesbian rape that aren't related to the interviews. I mean, come on, this is the same kind of stuff T. F. Mous did in Men Behind the Sun (and, more recently, Andrey Iskanov in Philosophy of a Knife), except the emphasis is far more on the sex than the violence here. It's a hypocritical film in that it decries the actions these women are taking while doing its level best to present them to the viewers in the most erotic fashion possible. And the most disturbing part? In more than a few cases; they succeed; I don't think it automatically makes me a sexual sadist to say that some of this stuff is hotter than anything you'll see on late-night Skinemax. Why do I think this? Because I believe it was the intention of the filmmakers to make these scenes erotic. (Yes, I've considered the possibility that they did so in order to make some sort of statement on the Neanderthal qualities of the males who might watch this movie. If so, well, guilty as charged. Men think about sex every six seconds. What they didn't tell you in that study is that every one of those thoughts is 5.99 seconds long. If you put soft, supple, naked skin in front of us in low lighting, we're going to be turned on.)

Of course, it's also possible that the filmmakers chose to make the scenes erotic in order to make the violence in them more disturbing, and if they did so for that reason, there are a couple of times they succeeded, but in the main here they erred on the opposite end of the spectrum; the assaults themselves just aren't brutal. And, again I'm trying to read the minds of the filmmakers here, they could have been trying for subtlety; after all, a major part of the rape experience, as it has been described to me by victims (including a few who were victims of the very crime depicted in this documentary), is the mental and emotional struggle for dominance. And we have seen that sort of thing depicted well in film. Not so here. Is that a disturbing look, or a longing one? We don't know. And we can probably attribute that more to the actors doing the recreating than those behind the camera, but one way or the other, it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to.

This is a movie that should have been distressing and heartbreaking. It is neither. I don't believe that my sex entered into my judgment about this, but I could very well be wrong; I don't know any women who have seen this yet, so I haven't been able to bounce ideas off anyone to find out if they felt differently about it than I did. So I may well have spent the last fifteen minutes digging myself a grave in writing this review, in the same way I believe the filmmakers did. If so, by all means, go ahead and push me in. Just explain to me why I'm wrong here, because no matter how many times I go over the construction and execution of this documentary in my head, I always come back to the idea that it's an exploitation flick in sheep's clothing. I'm giving it half a star, because I can't bring myself to zero it; I have to give the filmmakers at least the benefit of the doubt that they didn't mean it to be exploitative, and honestly, as distressed as I was by the lack of success in its stated mission, I didn't really find it offensive for that, just ineffective and kind of pathetic.",1242950400,5,4249,4.396442185514612
3028142,1,B000YEBL64,"Anyone trying to get useful information about the serious issue of woman-to-woman rape will know that a quick search on google brings up a myriad of pornographic references - and this film. At first I was hopeful that this film would give airtime to a deeply sensitive, contentious and hidden issue. Some of the comments made appear to be perceptive, but I agree with the observations of other reviewers who consider that this is not a genuine documentary at all. The graphic 'reenactments' of a woman-to-woman rape are too prolonged and it's nothing like any portrayal of male-to-female rape which I've ever seen in a drama or documentary. It's pornography, plain and simple, and very unpleasant viewing. This would likely cause significant distress to anyone who's had this experience themselves. If you're looking for a serious engagement with this issue, look up Lori Girshick's book, 'Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence: Does She Call it Rape?'.",1240531200,4,946,5.189542483660131

3028144,3,B000YEBL64,"as other reviews have indicated this documentary is confusing as it is supposed to highlight a rarely acknowledged crime against women but the way it has been put together seems to defeat the serious nature of it...the re-enactments are unnecessarily graphic...if you are looking for simulated 'rape' sex scenes with little sound (just some whimpering)which are very explicit, vulva's, labia's all shown by not bad looking actresses then get this movie but don't expect to learn much about lesbian rape.",1226102400,4,503,5.3
3028145,2,B000YEBL64,"This film is not about lesbian rape. This film is about female perpetrators of sexual assault. There are many downfalls of this film, and one of the most notable is the notion that a female who sexually assaults another female must be a lesbian and a woman who is assaulted by another woman is somehow a lesbian. Because none of the victims or perpetrators identify themselves as lesbian (in fact, there is hardly any verbal, environmental, or relational context for any of the rape scenes) perhaps the film makers unintentionally conflated female-to-female sexual assault and lesbian rape. The film dangerously interweaves incest, rape of a child, sexual assault and lesbian rape as if they were the same thing. But let's be clear: they are distinct forms of victimization.

I am not a denier of lesbian domestic or sexual violence. I have been an advocate in the anti-domestic and sexual violence field for 9 years and I am very familiar with the dynamics and effects of lesbian domestic violence and sexual assault and the larger societal context in which they take place.

I think I understand the film maker's intent to expose the existence of female-to-female sexual assault - the intent to explain and portray what some people think of as impossible. I even think I understand why they chose to show rape scenes over and over and over - as a way to prove the mechanics of how a woman can rape another woman. I think I can even understand the film makers' decision to use very young, feminine women to play the victims and perpetrators - to unravel stereotypes that in an abuse situation ""butch"" women are the aggressive attackers and ""femme"" women are the submissive victims. Why they chose to only portray rape between very young, feminine women and not diverse ages or gender expressions, I do not know. The rape scenes also seem to mimic pornography until the viewer picks up on the lack of consent (a comment on the relationship between pornography and sexual violence?). Why they chose not to address intimate partner sexual assault is unclear to me as well. None of this is clear because none of the film makers' choices are explained or obvious.

In a print interview, the film makers do explain their choice to include interviews with the general public, contrasting them with feminist theorists. The feminist theorist most commonly quoted is Camille Paglia, an anti-feminist feminist whose opinions on gender, sexuality, rape, sexual harassment, and homosexuality are far from representative of feminist theory. Why didn't the film makers quote or contact one of the most well known researchers on lesbian rape, Lori B. Girshick (author of Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence: Does She Call it Rape?)?

Of all the misconceptions and stereotypes the film claims to be breaking, the rape victim turned perpetrator is dealt with most ungracefully. As the director of D.C. Rape Crisis Center, the only expert appearing in the film, correctly states, not all victims become perpetrators (a common myth about abused boys), but some perpetrators have been victimized. Though verbally explained, two of the rape scenarios involved women who had previously been victimized portrayed as perpetrators. What image do you think the viewer is going to be left with?

Overall, this film is bound to be misunderstood and misused. From most accounts, it seems to be dismissed as pornography. This is problematic given that the sexual acts depicted are not consensual. However, it can also be dangerous if taken seriously as representative of lesbian rape. This film is not about lesbian rape. It is about female-to-female sexual assault. Being assaulted by another woman does not make the victim or the perpetrator a lesbian. Had the film been well made, our time may have been better spent actually discussing the issues instead of guessing about the integrity and intent.",1221091200,30,3867,5.0359375
3028146,5,B000YEBL64,"I had seen this documentary on youtube and I had tried to purchase it for some time, when I finally found it on amazon.com, and upon actually seeing it, I was most impressed.  I have seen many of the other reviews of this documentary, and the hostile nature of most of them calling it pornographic or disappointing or baulking at it in some other way, are either a), men who just don't get it and never will and don't want to accept that women are capable of these things too, yet they don't seem to hide from it when it's their wives or girlfriends abusing them, b), women who don't want to accept it.
It's so easy isn't it to laugh or critisize.  To make a documentary like this takes guts and a real determination to get the truth heard.  Of course lesbian rape happens, just like homosexual rape happens in the male community in prisons for example.  What makes this so worthy of critism for telling the other side of it?  I am hoping to publish a book which attacks women, which critisizes their attitudes in modern society, which may never see the light of day because no one wants to hear it, and so I have to admire this documentary and the makers not only for having the guts to make it in the first place, but for the quality of it too.  I was always aware of the darker side of women unfortunately, and it made me laugh when a lot of these victims said they didn't think women were capable of such things.  Well they are.  And pregnancy is the most vindictive weapon that women can use against them, and they get away with it every time.
I say well done indeed to the makers for being Brave and honest.  It's just a pity that we live in a world which likes to hide from these things and slag off what it doesn't understand.",1218412800,3,1734,4.262195121951219
3028147,3,B000YEBL64,"This movie is a brilliant horrible joke. Whoever made this film is laughing so hard at us that they will not stop laughing for a long time. On one hand the documentary seems to deal with a serious matter, such as lesbian rape. Most people who are interviewed seem to talk about the theme in a believable way. The testimonials seem believable too, on the surface. The narrator of the documentary, the explanations she gives us are believable. The text scrolling down on the screen about the fact that women can be rapists sounds believable to me, too. On the other hand, the alleged documentary has porn-like reenactments of sexual abuse between women with would-be porn actresses paid to stage lesbian rape scenes for the shock, amazement and perhaps pleasure of the viewers. Why do I call this a ""brilliant horrible joke""? I call it ""brilliant"" because the filmmakers have achieved what they sought for. This is a kind of Andy Kaufman's joke. (Have you watched the movie about this comedian starring Jim Carrey? If you haven't, go watch ""Man on the Moon"" and you'll see what I mean!) Andy Kaufman was a comedian who relished in pulling practical jokes on everybody: family, friends, girlfriends, you name it. The kind of practical joke Andy liked to pull was to act as though he was serious about something outrageous and horrible when in fact that was all an inside joke. When his family was told he had cancer and he was dying nobody believed him, because they thought he was pulling another practical joke. I view this documentary as a big practical joke. I am sure this was a concept of one person or a group of friends, who decided: ""Hey, let's make a seemingly serious documentary about something as outrageous as lesbian rape, something on the edge of believability, and then for the hell of it we will insert staged porn scenes about the same theme. Let's see how many people we will be able to fool and outrage. Let's see if someone will see for what this really is: a big practical joke, which is going to make us rich."" And guess what, the filmmakers did just that, as at the moment this practical joke is a huge success in sales. What was supposed to be just a practical joke, became so much more. It became a brilliant marketing strategy to sell a porn DVD to people who wouldn't watch porn. Even better, with the buzz that this (probably unintended)  marketing strategy created, they turned a run-of-the-mill rape fantasy porn DVD  into something that is making them extremely rich while the filmmakers laugh their way to the bank.",1216425600,8,2546,4.66815144766147
3028148,2,B000YEBL64,"I'm trying to decide if this is a serious inquiry or an excuse for some unskillful porn. While there is one interviewee who gives the impression of knowing her stuff, The others seem pointedly uninformed, naive, or somewhat inarticulate on the subject. Much of the film consists of interviews, interspersed with very graphic, though quite unbelievable scenes of forced sex between women. No one puts up much of a struggle. No one cries out for help. No one seems to resist very much, except for some squeaky protests worthy of an S&M site. Submission seems to be the order of the day. The cinematography and composition of the dramatized sequences are chaotic, with 'way too much onscreen. One sequence consists of two, count 'em, two rapes in inset boxes, a background that consists of yet another rape in progress, and a long title crawl in the bottom half of the screen, which is yet another rape tale in text. So, what are we supposed to look at? It makes George Lucas look leisurely!

So... I'm trying to decide whether this is an attempt at a scholarly framing device for porn, or if the creators actually believe they've contributed something to a high level communication about an issue they claim to be extremely widespread. I've known plenty of people in ""the life,"" and have never heard anything to support their statistic that 30 per cent of lesbians have been sexually assaulted by a person not their partner.

There is one other thing I found quite disturbing; a general demeaning of male sexuality reminiscent of the most strident feminism of the 1970's. It's out of date, ladies. Male sexuality does not seek to ""wound."" Your association of popular words for sex (nail, screw, etc.) with harmful intention is your own problem. There are indeed loving and devoted men. Perhaps if you get your mind out of victim mentality, you have a chance to portray important issues in a way that doesn't present women as the wounded prey  of implacable sadists. All of your graphic depictions of sex simply placed a woman in the role of a pathological man,  popping out of the shadows and doing their dirty work. Perhaps you meant well. Perhaps it was a cynical excuse to sell some uninspired sex footage. If the issue is indeed this widespread, it deserved a higher level of integrity, as well as more competent production values.",1212364800,44,2333,4.781637717121588
3028149,1,B000YEBL64,"I wish I would have known there were reviews of this movie before I purchased it. Hoping to be informed on a subject that deserves attention, I was ""treated"" to poor reenactments with horrible actresses that only degraded the validity of the film. The film was poorly edited and how the information was presented lacked sophistication and polish. I wish more time was given to presenting scholarly information than the reenacted sex scenes. I don't need to see a rape to believe it exists.",1212278400,27,489,4.833333333333333
3028150,5,B000YEBL64,"Before writing this review I should say that I am a survivor of lesbian sexual violence and a crisis center councilor.  As a survivor of lesbian rape, I have experienced both the reality of the event itself, and also the type of responses that come from experts, law enforcement, and the general public. Having experienced the refusal of many to take such a soul shattering event seriously, I believe that She Stole My Voice is an absolutely essential documentary for current American society.

For me, this film is especially painful to watch.  Even so, I have watched it with friends and family members who know about my experience as well as with other survivors. After watching this film they have been better able to understanding both what lesbian rape actually entails, and the aftermath of such an experience. It has allowed them to better empathize with my experiences and others like mine, and transformed the way many have reacted to my own situation. I found the reenactments to be extremely graphic and explicit.  However, I believe that these scenes are essential in changing the perspective in those who watch them. I believe that much of the ignorance that people have about lesbian rape comes from an inability to conceptualize it or visualize it at all. Seeing what lesbian rape entails is a major step in remedying that issue.

I also want to put a myth to rest. Some have suggested that She Stole My Voice is not realistic, because the perpetrators of sexual violence are ""attractive,"" the idea being that attractive women do not rape. That attitude is exactly what allows female sexual predators to get away with rape. I have been raped by a woman who would be considered attractive. Many of the women with whom I have spoken have been raped by women who would be considered physically attractive.

Rapists, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are not ugly on the outside. They are ugly on the inside. Many are that way because of how they have dealt with their own traumas. Others are that way for other reasons.

I want to encourage everyone to watch this film, and to share it with their friends and family. This is an issue that needs to be brought to the surface.  We as a society must work towards increasing awareness of this crime and eliminating it.",1210723200,23,2279,4.766497461928934
3028151,1,B000YEBL64,"Pathetic and Insane

I've watched a good bit of this now and the words and imagery are totally at odds. It's as if these women are both condemning lesbian rape and indulging in their softcore les-rape fantasies simultaneously.

Why are all the rapists kinda hot? How come all the victims seem to want it? It's just a bunch of hot chicks rolling around crying crocodile tears, pretending to be tied up. After a few minutes of each of the interminably long and carefully staged rape scenes you start to think, ""If you don't like it why don't you just leave?""

This just doesn't jibe with the few actual stories told about lesbian rape, which are truly sad, and painfully trivialized by the imagery.

I think it also says something about the mush-mindedness of the women who made this thing. They're so ""powerless"" that fighting or fleeing would never occur to them? Pathetic.

Upon finishing the film I've decided that it's more disingenuous than that. I swear to god they shot this footage as some sort of lesbian rape fantasy porn and when they couldn't sell it as that, decided to splice in a few interviews and market it as an anti-lesbian-rape movie. It's a sexploitation flick, plain and simple. Go rent some classic 70's sexploitation if that's what you're into, at least you'll have a laugh.",1208476800,41,1297,4.721238938053097
3028152,5,B000YEBL64,"This is vital viewing for those who are completely ignorant of lesbian rape. It was graphic, heart wrenching and completely brutal - yet it was a realistic depiction of same sex rape - a rape which for too long has been considered a ""good rape""

Rape needs to be redefined in order to increase people's awareness. One absolutely brilliant analysis of rape stemmed from a research carried out on an undisclosed number of men who agreed that they would be more distraught if their female friends/family members had been raped by another man, rather than by another woman. This was attributed to the fact that women are commodified and treated as property by men (Engels) and so by violating ""their"" women, they were essentially violating their ""property"", nevertheless, as women are unable to own property, the rape of a woman by another woman is not treated as a violation.

The video also contains an analysis of the issue by experts in the field, as well as detailed accounts by victims on their own experiences. The video also interviews several members of the public and records their personal views on the issue, some of which are completely ignorant, further emphasizing the need for public awareness on the issue.",1207785600,6,1219,4.884057971014493

This is quite unusual for a documentary.
Then I started to research about the filmmakers ""Armand Kaye"" and ""Justine Chang"". I couldn't find anything about them. It seems that they don't exist.
Then I searched for ""Martin Vogial"" and ""Global Independent Film Showcase"". All I could find was a subwebside, that belongs to the company ""Roland Media Distribution"" who sells the films.

3028154,5,B000YEBL64,"She Stole My Voice is a  complex, subtle, shocking, jarring, and totally original film. Is it pornographic? The film contains extremely explicit depictions of sex, nudity, and violence. But each scene is not designed to titillate or arouse; it depicts subtle nuances of a highly complex and highly prevalent crime. So although it is explicit, I would not be tempted to call it pornographic.

Particularly controversial is the incest scene in which an incest rape occurs after one younger sister voyeuristically watches her older sister shower, and later licks her discarded underwear. On the surface and completely out of context this may seem erotic. But looking beneath the surface, you see how realistically it depicts the idea of sexual violence beginning with one party and spiraling out of control. At the same time, it shows the kind of dysfunctional family life that leads to incest (all of which is classified as sexual violence, regardless of the willingess of either party).

I am not convinced that smelling another person's underwear indicates that you want to be raped. To me, that kind of sounds like saying ""she kissed me, so I knew she wanted sex."" As the expert mentions earlier in the film, voyeurism is in itself a form of sexual violence. Adding layer to the depiction, the actresses in the scene are themselves biological sisters, and have described in interviews how difficult the scene was for them to do, and that their willingness to do the scene was based on their belief that the message needed to get out.

Not the most traditional documentary, but that, in my view, is what makes it particularly worthwhile and valuable. While it is graphic, a thorough analysis shows how far from pornographic this film actually is.",1203033600,7,1746,4.969178082191781

I can understand a tasteful reenactment but this is NOT in any way tasteful. I think that anyone that decides to view this should know what they are in for. I almost feel like I need to make a public apology to every lesbian that may have had an encounter that they would consider rape, because this is purely a slap in the face to them!

I purchased this ""documentary"" about ""lesbian rape"" for my spouse and I to watch since we greatly enjoy documentary films. From reading the other reviews and the product information it seemed I would be learning about something which I had never entertained as a real life situation of concern. Who hears of ""lesbian rape""? We were intrigued...

With that said I will first express my concern for the individual who has been the victim of rape that may watch this ""documentary"" in hopes of finding this helpful to their healing process, in not feeling alone, or finding help in understanding the emotional trauma they might feel about their own experience. In addition, this ""documentary"" did little more than convince us that there is no such thing as lesbian rape... at least if there is this film is the poorest portrayal of such a life changing and traumatic event EVER!

In all honesty, I feel this ""documentary"", which has been seemingly raved about by other reviewers, is nothing more than cheaply done, amateur lesbian porn. To say this is any depiction of rape is misleading. I will admit that watching it in one sitting would be difficult as we repeatedly had to stop and walk away to try to figure out what we were watching and how it pertained to rape. People have fetishes, people partake in sadomasochistic practices and ""taboo"" sex... even lesbians. I cannot for the life of me figure out how it would be possible for one female to rape another when the circumstances begin with one woman smelling and licking the panties of the other??? She catches her doing this and rapes her? Ummm... wouldn't you say smelling and licking panties is a pretty good signal you actually want to engage in some sort of sexual relations with the person's panties you are doing this to?

Like many interviewed in the DVD I was like how can a woman who is already gay be raped by another woman.  Plus I was like there is no penetration so how is it rape?  Watching this DVD answered that question.  When we take away our prejudices and imagine how would we feel if it were our sister, our mother, our friend it happened to it becomes real.  I love that they had professionals in the film talk about this issue as well as victims.  I will agree with one of the critiques this documentary gets and that's all women raped by women are not all lesbians, some of them are straight getting taken advantage of by being drugged or strong armed like men get raped in prison, women get raped in prison and out of it.  I watched this DVD a few years ago, but now that I am a book author revisiting the topic of lesbian rape I thought it important to add my voice.

3262638,1,B000YEBL64,"She Stole My Voice: A Documentary About Lesbian Rape (Justine Chang and Armand Kaye, 2007)

I actually watched this a few months ago, and I've been letting it stew in my head ever since trying to figure out what to say about it. It's a movie that I feel really, really bad about panning, because the subject matter is kind of the opposite of fluffy bunnies; it's one of those things that has IMPORTANT, SERIOUS, SENSITIVE SUBJECT stamped on its forehead in big red letters. But, well, as the man once said, ""all bad poetry is sincere."" The same is true of documentaries, I guess. And, really, when it comes right down to it, the filmmakers did a great deal of the digging on the grave I'm about to push them into. Why? Because this is less a documentary than it is an exploitation flick--a number of interviews with women who have been sexually assaulted by other women intercut with (or, sometimes, used as narration for) recreations of the events, or scenes depicting the horror of lesbian rape that aren't related to the interviews. I mean, come on, this is the same kind of stuff T. F. Mous did in Men Behind the Sun (and, more recently, Andrey Iskanov in Philosophy of a Knife), except the emphasis is far more on the sex than the violence here. It's a hypocritical film in that it decries the actions these women are taking while doing its level best to present them to the viewers in the most erotic fashion possible. And the most disturbing part? In more than a few cases; they succeed; I don't think it automatically makes me a sexual sadist to say that some of this stuff is hotter than anything you'll see on late-night Skinemax. Why do I think this? Because I believe it was the intention of the filmmakers to make these scenes erotic. (Yes, I've considered the possibility that they did so in order to make some sort of statement on the Neanderthal qualities of the males who might watch this movie. If so, well, guilty as charged. Men think about sex every six seconds. What they didn't tell you in that study is that every one of those thoughts is 5.99 seconds long. If you put soft, supple, naked skin in front of us in low lighting, we're going to be turned on.)

Of course, it's also possible that the filmmakers chose to make the scenes erotic in order to make the violence in them more disturbing, and if they did so for that reason, there are a couple of times they succeeded, but in the main here they erred on the opposite end of the spectrum; the assaults themselves just aren't brutal. And, again I'm trying to read the minds of the filmmakers here, they could have been trying for subtlety; after all, a major part of the rape experience, as it has been described to me by victims (including a few who were victims of the very crime depicted in this documentary), is the mental and emotional struggle for dominance. And we have seen that sort of thing depicted well in film. Not so here. Is that a disturbing look, or a longing one? We don't know. And we can probably attribute that more to the actors doing the recreating than those behind the camera, but one way or the other, it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to.

This is a movie that should have been distressing and heartbreaking. It is neither. I don't believe that my sex entered into my judgment about this, but I could very well be wrong; I don't know any women who have seen this yet, so I haven't been able to bounce ideas off anyone to find out if they felt differently about it than I did. So I may well have spent the last fifteen minutes digging myself a grave in writing this review, in the same way I believe the filmmakers did. If so, by all means, go ahead and push me in. Just explain to me why I'm wrong here, because no matter how many times I go over the construction and execution of this documentary in my head, I always come back to the idea that it's an exploitation flick in sheep's clothing. I'm giving it half a star, because I can't bring myself to zero it; I have to give the filmmakers at least the benefit of the doubt that they didn't mean it to be exploitative, and honestly, as distressed as I was by the lack of success in its stated mission, I didn't really find it offensive for that, just ineffective and kind of pathetic.",1242950400,5,4249,4.396442185514612

At first I was hopeful that this film would give airtime to a deeply sensitive, contentious and hidden issue. Some of the comments made appear to be perceptive, but I agree with the observations of other reviewers who consider that this is not a genuine documentary at all. The graphic 'reenactments' of a woman-to-woman rape are too prolonged and it's nothing like any portrayal of male-to-female rape which I've ever seen in a drama or documentary. It's pornography, plain and simple, and very unpleasant viewing. This would likely cause significant distress to anyone who's had this experience themselves. If you're looking for a serious engagement with this issue, look up Lori Girshick's book, 'Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence: Does She Call it Rape?'.",1240531200,4,946,5.189542483660131

3262642,2,B000YEBL64,"This film is not about lesbian rape. This film is about female perpetrators of sexual assault. There are many downfalls of this film, and one of the most notable is the notion that a female who sexually assaults another female must be a lesbian and a woman who is assaulted by another woman is somehow a lesbian. Because none of the victims or perpetrators identify themselves as lesbian (in fact, there is hardly any verbal, environmental, or relational context for any of the rape scenes) perhaps the film makers unintentionally conflated female-to-female sexual assault and lesbian rape. The film dangerously interweaves incest, rape of a child, sexual assault and lesbian rape as if they were the same thing. But let's be clear: they are distinct forms of victimization.

I am not a denier of lesbian domestic or sexual violence. I have been an advocate in the anti-domestic and sexual violence field for 9 years and I am very familiar with the dynamics and effects of lesbian domestic violence and sexual assault and the larger societal context in which they take place.

I think I understand the film maker's intent to expose the existence of female-to-female sexual assault - the intent to explain and portray what some people think of as impossible. I even think I understand why they chose to show rape scenes over and over and over - as a way to prove the mechanics of how a woman can rape another woman. I think I can even understand the film makers' decision to use very young, feminine women to play the victims and perpetrators - to unravel stereotypes that in an abuse situation ""butch"" women are the aggressive attackers and ""femme"" women are the submissive victims. Why they chose to only portray rape between very young, feminine women and not diverse ages or gender expressions, I do not know. The rape scenes also seem to mimic pornography until the viewer picks up on the lack of consent (a comment on the relationship between pornography and sexual violence?). Why they chose not to address intimate partner sexual assault is unclear to me as well. None of this is clear because none of the film makers' choices are explained or obvious.

In a print interview, the film makers do explain their choice to include interviews with the general public, contrasting them with feminist theorists. The feminist theorist most commonly quoted is Camille Paglia, an anti-feminist feminist whose opinions on gender, sexuality, rape, sexual harassment, and homosexuality are far from representative of feminist theory. Why didn't the film makers quote or contact one of the most well known researchers on lesbian rape, Lori B. Girshick (author of Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence: Does She Call it Rape?)?

Of all the misconceptions and stereotypes the film claims to be breaking, the rape victim turned perpetrator is dealt with most ungracefully. As the director of D.C. Rape Crisis Center, the only expert appearing in the film, correctly states, not all victims become perpetrators (a common myth about abused boys), but some perpetrators have been victimized. Though verbally explained, two of the rape scenarios involved women who had previously been victimized portrayed as perpetrators. What image do you think the viewer is going to be left with?

Overall, this film is bound to be misunderstood and misused. From most accounts, it seems to be dismissed as pornography. This is problematic given that the sexual acts depicted are not consensual. However, it can also be dangerous if taken seriously as representative of lesbian rape. This film is not about lesbian rape. It is about female-to-female sexual assault. Being assaulted by another woman does not make the victim or the perpetrator a lesbian. Had the film been well made, our time may have been better spent actually discussing the issues instead of guessing about the integrity and intent.",1221091200,30,3867,5.0359375
3262643,5,B000YEBL64,"I had seen this documentary on youtube and I had tried to purchase it for some time, when I finally found it on amazon.com, and upon actually seeing it, I was most impressed.  I have seen many of the other reviews of this documentary, and the hostile nature of most of them calling it pornographic or disappointing or baulking at it in some other way, are either a), men who just don't get it and never will and don't want to accept that women are capable of these things too, yet they don't seem to hide from it when it's their wives or girlfriends abusing them, b), women who don't want to accept it.
It's so easy isn't it to laugh or critisize.  To make a documentary like this takes guts and a real determination to get the truth heard.  Of course lesbian rape happens, just like homosexual rape happens in the male community in prisons for example.  What makes this so worthy of critism for telling the other side of it?  I am hoping to publish a book which attacks women, which critisizes their attitudes in modern society, which may never see the light of day because no one wants to hear it, and so I have to admire this documentary and the makers not only for having the guts to make it in the first place, but for the quality of it too.  I was always aware of the darker side of women unfortunately, and it made me laugh when a lot of these victims said they didn't think women were capable of such things.  Well they are.  And pregnancy is the most vindictive weapon that women can use against them, and they get away with it every time.
I say well done indeed to the makers for being Brave and honest.  It's just a pity that we live in a world which likes to hide from these things and slag off what it doesn't understand.",1218412800,3,1734,4.262195121951219
3262644,3,B000YEBL64,"This movie is a brilliant horrible joke. Whoever made this film is laughing so hard at us that they will not stop laughing for a long time. On one hand the documentary seems to deal with a serious matter, such as lesbian rape. Most people who are interviewed seem to talk about the theme in a believable way. The testimonials seem believable too, on the surface. The narrator of the documentary, the explanations she gives us are believable. The text scrolling down on the screen about the fact that women can be rapists sounds believable to me, too. On the other hand, the alleged documentary has porn-like reenactments of sexual abuse between women with would-be porn actresses paid to stage lesbian rape scenes for the shock, amazement and perhaps pleasure of the viewers. Why do I call this a ""brilliant horrible joke""? I call it ""brilliant"" because the filmmakers have achieved what they sought for. This is a kind of Andy Kaufman's joke. (Have you watched the movie about this comedian starring Jim Carrey? If you haven't, go watch ""Man on the Moon"" and you'll see what I mean!) Andy Kaufman was a comedian who relished in pulling practical jokes on everybody: family, friends, girlfriends, you name it. The kind of practical joke Andy liked to pull was to act as though he was serious about something outrageous and horrible when in fact that was all an inside joke. When his family was told he had cancer and he was dying nobody believed him, because they thought he was pulling another practical joke. I view this documentary as a big practical joke. I am sure this was a concept of one person or a group of friends, who decided: ""Hey, let's make a seemingly serious documentary about something as outrageous as lesbian rape, something on the edge of believability, and then for the hell of it we will insert staged porn scenes about the same theme. Let's see how many people we will be able to fool and outrage. Let's see if someone will see for what this really is: a big practical joke, which is going to make us rich."" And guess what, the filmmakers did just that, as at the moment this practical joke is a huge success in sales. What was supposed to be just a practical joke, became so much more. It became a brilliant marketing strategy to sell a porn DVD to people who wouldn't watch porn. Even better, with the buzz that this (probably unintended)  marketing strategy created, they turned a run-of-the-mill rape fantasy porn DVD  into something that is making them extremely rich while the filmmakers laugh their way to the bank.",1216425600,8,2546,4.66815144766147
3262645,2,B000YEBL64,"I'm trying to decide if this is a serious inquiry or an excuse for some unskillful porn. While there is one interviewee who gives the impression of knowing her stuff, The others seem pointedly uninformed, naive, or somewhat inarticulate on the subject. Much of the film consists of interviews, interspersed with very graphic, though quite unbelievable scenes of forced sex between women. No one puts up much of a struggle. No one cries out for help. No one seems to resist very much, except for some squeaky protests worthy of an S&M site. Submission seems to be the order of the day. The cinematography and composition of the dramatized sequences are chaotic, with 'way too much onscreen. One sequence consists of two, count 'em, two rapes in inset boxes, a background that consists of yet another rape in progress, and a long title crawl in the bottom half of the screen, which is yet another rape tale in text. So, what are we supposed to look at? It makes George Lucas look leisurely!

So... I'm trying to decide whether this is an attempt at a scholarly framing device for porn, or if the creators actually believe they've contributed something to a high level communication about an issue they claim to be extremely widespread. I've known plenty of people in ""the life,"" and have never heard anything to support their statistic that 30 per cent of lesbians have been sexually assaulted by a person not their partner.

There is one other thing I found quite disturbing; a general demeaning of male sexuality reminiscent of the most strident feminism of the 1970's. It's out of date, ladies. Male sexuality does not seek to ""wound."" Your association of popular words for sex (nail, screw, etc.) with harmful intention is your own problem. There are indeed loving and devoted men. Perhaps if you get your mind out of victim mentality, you have a chance to portray important issues in a way that doesn't present women as the wounded prey  of implacable sadists. All of your graphic depictions of sex simply placed a woman in the role of a pathological man,  popping out of the shadows and doing their dirty work. Perhaps you meant well. Perhaps it was a cynical excuse to sell some uninspired sex footage.

3262647,5,B000YEBL64,"Before writing this review I should say that I am a survivor of lesbian sexual violence and a crisis center councilor.  As a survivor of lesbian rape, I have experienced both the reality of the event itself, and also the type of responses that come from experts, law enforcement, and the general public. Having experienced the refusal of many to take such a soul shattering event seriously, I believe that She Stole My Voice is an absolutely essential documentary for current American society.

For me, this film is especially painful to watch.  Even so, I have watched it with friends and family members who know about my experience as well as with other survivors. After watching this film they have been better able to understanding both what lesbian rape actually entails, and the aftermath of such an experience. It has allowed them to better empathize with my experiences and others like mine, and transformed the way many have reacted to my own situation. I found the reenactments to be extremely graphic and explicit.  However, I believe that these scenes are essential in changing the perspective in those who watch them. I believe that much of the ignorance that people have about lesbian rape comes from an inability to conceptualize it or visualize it at all. Seeing what lesbian rape entails is a major step in remedying that issue.

I also want to put a myth to rest. Some have suggested that She Stole My Voice is not realistic, because the perpetrators of sexual violence are ""attractive,"" the idea being that attractive women do not rape. That attitude is exactly what allows female sexual predators to get away with rape. I have been raped by a woman who would be considered attractive. Many of the women with whom I have spoken have been raped by women who would be considered physically attractive.

Rapists, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are not ugly on the outside. They are ugly on the inside. Many are that way because of how they have dealt with their own traumas. Others are that way for other reasons.

I want to encourage everyone to watch this film, and to share it with their friends and family. This is an issue that needs to be brought to the surface.  We as a society must work towards increasing awareness of this crime and eliminating it.",1210723200,23,2279,4.766497461928934

I've watched a good bit of this now and the words and imagery are totally at odds. It's as if these women are both condemning lesbian rape and indulging in their softcore les-rape fantasies simultaneously.

Why are all the rapists kinda hot? How come all the victims seem to want it? It's just a bunch of hot chicks rolling around crying crocodile tears, pretending to be tied up. After a few minutes of each of the interminably long and carefully staged rape scenes you start to think, ""If you don't like it why don't you just leave?""

This just doesn't jibe with the few actual stories told about lesbian rape, which are truly sad, and painfully trivialized by the imagery.

I think it also says something about the mush-mindedness of the women who made this thing. They're so ""powerless"" that fighting or fleeing would never occur to them? Pathetic.

Upon finishing the film I've decided that it's more disingenuous than that. I swear to god they shot this footage as some sort of lesbian rape fantasy porn and when they couldn't sell it as that, decided to splice in a few interviews and market it as an anti-lesbian-rape movie. It's a sexploitation flick, plain and simple. Go rent some classic 70's sexploitation if that's what you're into, at least you'll have a laugh.",1208476800,41,1297,4.721238938053097

Rape needs to be redefined in order to increase people's awareness. One absolutely brilliant analysis of rape stemmed from a research carried out on an undisclosed number of men who agreed that they would be more distraught if their female friends/family members had been raped by another man, rather than by another woman. This was attributed to the fact that women are commodified and treated as property by men (Engels) and so by violating ""their"" women, they were essentially violating their ""property"", nevertheless, as women are unable to own property, the rape of a woman by another woman is not treated as a violation.

The video also contains an analysis of the issue by experts in the field, as well as detailed accounts by victims on their own experiences. The video also interviews several members of the public and records their personal views on the issue, some of which are completely ignorant, further emphasizing the need for public awareness on the issue.",1207785600,6,1219,4.884057971014493

3262651,5,B000YEBL64,"She Stole My Voice is a  complex, subtle, shocking, jarring, and totally original film. Is it pornographic? The film contains extremely explicit depictions of sex, nudity, and violence. But each scene is not designed to titillate or arouse; it depicts subtle nuances of a highly complex and highly prevalent crime. So although it is explicit, I would not be tempted to call it pornographic.

Particularly controversial is the incest scene in which an incest rape occurs after one younger sister voyeuristically watches her older sister shower, and later licks her discarded underwear. On the surface and completely out of context this may seem erotic. But looking beneath the surface, you see how realistically it depicts the idea of sexual violence beginning with one party and spiraling out of control. At the same time, it shows the kind of dysfunctional family life that leads to incest (all of which is classified as sexual violence, regardless of the willingess of either party).

I am not convinced that smelling another person's underwear indicates that you want to be raped. To me, that kind of sounds like saying ""she kissed me, so I knew she wanted sex."" As the expert mentions earlier in the film, voyeurism is in itself a form of sexual violence. Adding layer to the depiction, the actresses in the scene are themselves biological sisters, and have described in interviews how difficult the scene was for them to do, and that their willingness to do the scene was based on their belief that the message needed to get out.

Not the most traditional documentary, but that, in my view, is what makes it particularly worthwhile and valuable. While it is graphic, a thorough analysis shows how far from pornographic this film actually is.",1203033600,7,1746,4.969178082191781

I purchased this ""documentary"" about ""lesbian rape"" for my spouse and I to watch since we greatly enjoy documentary films. From reading the other reviews and the product information it seemed I would be learning about something which I had never entertained as a real life situation of concern. Who hears of ""lesbian rape""? We were intrigued...

With that said I will first express my concern for the individual who has been the victim of rape that may watch this ""documentary"" in hopes of finding this helpful to their healing process, in not feeling alone, or finding help in understanding the emotional trauma they might feel about their own experience. In addition, this ""documentary"" did little more than convince us that there is no such thing as lesbian rape... at least if there is this film is the poorest portrayal of such a life changing and traumatic event EVER!

In all honesty, I feel this ""documentary"", which has been seemingly raved about by other reviewers, is nothing more than cheaply done, amateur lesbian porn. To say this is any depiction of rape is misleading. I will admit that watching it in one sitting would be difficult as we repeatedly had to stop and walk away to try to figure out what we were watching and how it pertained to rape. People have fetishes, people partake in sadomasochistic practices and ""taboo"" sex... even lesbians. I cannot for the life of me figure out how it would be possible for one female to rape another when the circumstances begin with one woman smelling and licking the panties of the other??? She catches her doing this and rapes her? Ummm... wouldn't you say smelling and licking panties is a pretty good signal you actually want to engage in some sort of sexual relations with the person's panties you are doing this to?

8232433,1,B000YEBL64,"This feature masquerades itself as a documentary. I'm honestly not sure what it is, exactly. First of all, it's an extremely amateur production. The video editing is choppy and distracting. Frequently, as people are being interviewed, hardcore pornography is lightly overlaid across the screen, creating a visual nightmare that's hard to focus your eyes upon.

Secondly, most of the people being interviewed appear to be random strangers (or friends and family of the filmmaker(s) perhaps?). We're shown no credentials of any kind, or proof that they have any experience or authority on the subject matter. Maybe the filmmaker(s) wanted to showcase ""the common person's perspective."" Unfortunately it just comes across as rambling, uneducated nonsense for the most part.

Thirdly, the filmmaker(s) bombard viewers with massive amounts of text... so much so, that at one point they even resort to splitting the screen in half. The top half is then reserved for visuals (pornography), while the bottom half is dedicated to scrolling paragraph after paragraph of content.

My final complaint is about the pornography itself (which is about 50% of the film, if not more). One, it doesn't NEED to be there. It'll only turn off people who are honestly interested in this subject from a cultural or concerned perspective. That means only people looking for titillation might seek out this film... and the funny thing is, even THEY will be disappointed.

The pornographic scenes are regularly displayed through inverse filters. The angles and editing are atrocious. Again, you can tell this is an amateur production of the lowest degree. The actresses never speak, and barely make sounds of any kind. The end result is a perplexing mess... like watching mimes badly mimic sexual assaults.

In closing, this ""documentary"" is pointless for everyone, and ultimately does a complete disservice to the subject matter. If I could rate a product with ZERO stars, I would. I won't even bother to resell it, to try and recoup my $20. I'm just going to throw it in the trash, where it belongs.",1502323200,,2075,5.127218934911243
8232434,1,B000YEBL64,"I always try to keep an open mind and not be judgmental going into certain documentaries, but I must agree with every single negative assessment made about this one. This is not a real documentary, and even if you assume it is, there are so many things that make you question the integrity of the Directors it's pathetic. They inserted random interviews, and random testimonies, from random people, while not including any names or locations. The only ""professional"" who does most of the talking in this film holds no credentials and is not even a doctor. The only sources, or should I say, the only point of references for all of the quotes in this movie are sketchy at best. It's obvious that the montage of pictures displayed happen to be professionally taken photos. Even in a re-enactment, I hardly see where it was necessary to display perfectly waxed female vaginas, and women riding other women's faces and followed up with performing a very bad rendition of a spanking session, and all while their tan lines are visible. A well-done re-enactment gives you a powerful enough visual that you get the point without having to do all of that extra nonsense. In fact, the re-enactments remind you of some very bad acting that was indeed very pleasurable for the two ""actresses."" It didn't look like an accurate depiction of forced sex to me, it looked like they enjoyed it. I lie to you people NOT, the bad acting and fake crying are so bad, I was at a loss for words.

I don't know about everybody's else's copy, but mine had serious audio problems while talking to certain people, which leads me to believe that was purposefully done. On top of that, I really stopped taking it seriously when they proceeded to insert campy ""circus"" music in while they were showing the male's reactions to the questions on lesbian rape. I'm sorry, but rape is not something to be taken lightly at all. They inserted all these so-called fake quotes made by regular people only including their jobs, but no official names or titles, so those responses could've been very well made up. If that's not enough, the panty-sniffing/panty-licking scene was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my entire life. The split-screens running simultaneously while they had text scrolling up the screen was not only distracting, it was also a horrendous idea.

These people should be ashamed of themselves for putting such trash out and marketing it as a serious subject. There is nothing good I can say about this. I learned NOTHING!",1485734400,,2521,4.766590389016018

8232440,4,B000YEBL64,"Justine Chang introduces an eye-opening filmdoc on the issue of lesbian rape, while most people might find it impossible that this very violent exist -- Chang and her co-creator Armand Kaye opens this Pandora's box that might have many talking.  They tackle how when a woman is rape by another woman, it can be a struggle and even finding a support system might be difficult to come by.  What some miss about rape in general, some believe if you just fight back you won't be raped -- this is complete hogwash!  Rape is extremely traumatizing and demoralizing no matter who it happens to whether it's M/F, M/M, F/M (yes I said it!), and of course F/F.  In terms of reporting lesbian rape, it can be hard, especially if you come from the lesbian community, some might want you to keep it in house to keep from putting an ugly mark on the community as whole.  The judicial system can give you a rough time believing this kind of rape occurred, unless maybe if the offender is a complete masculine lesbian, otherwise it could a wasted effort to get these women arrested and persecuted.

Chang and Kaye gets interviews from people's perspectives on the issue of F-to-F rape, even one woman who was raped by a woman and her male acquittance during a night of drinking during a house party; she also talks about her childhood hearing of a rape that reminisces almost similar to her own.  You will also see many graphic depictions of lesbian rape featured in this film, many might view it as simply X-rated porn, but to paraphrase the narrator, ""there is no other way to talk about female rape.""

Now in terms of the filming, I do agree with many that the filming and editing isn't sharp in the least, it definitely takes away how good this filmdoc could had been.  Yet even with it's bad directing and editing, it still doesn't loose the main discussion on the topic personally.

In closing, I will say I'm almost shocked at some of the comments I'm viewing about this film.  While most who didn't like this film have made valid points into why -- some are watching this as a form of eroticism?  That's whether disturbing considering this was suppose to educate.

Overall I give it 3.5/5 stars.  Again it's not the best looking filmdoc I've seen before, still it opened me and a few of friends up for a discussion.",1356220800,3,2307,4.554479418886198
