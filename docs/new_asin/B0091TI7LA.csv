There are some great moments captured that remind me of some of my exploits.  I think at this point I have added 4 trips to my bucket list just from watching this film and Ride the Divide.

5242763,1,B0091TI7LA,"I tried to watch this. But the endless pseudo-philosophy these cyclists constantly spurt triggered my gag reflex too much. I switched it off and watched my cat lick his bum and empty sack instead, it was way more enthralling than this ""film"". It was like sitting on a train seat a row in front of a group of middle class back packers in a third world country and listening in on their cliche travel talk. These boys will one day watch this back and be overcome with self loathing and deep shame. They're just cycling around some places and talking nonsense. Don't waste your time buying this and funding their indulgent cycling holiday. These chaps need to grow some proper wisdom pubes and get some motorcycle licences.",1400371200,,720,4.677165354330708
5242764,2,B0091TI7LA,"It's hard to not compare ""Reveal the Path"" to ""Ride the Divide"".  Same basic 'characters' and outline.  The reason ""RTD"" was appealing was because it felt real.  I'm a father of two young kids and watching Mike Dion break down while talking to his daughter hit me in the gut.  Matthew Lee's trepidation regarding the impending birth of his son was wholly relatable.

Then the same two guys take off on a round-the-world mountain bike vacation with their buddies?  What the hell?  My mountain biking and vacationing has taken a major backseat since my kids were born. It felt very self-serving.  Watching the guys ride was okay, although I can't figure out why they only spent about five minutes in the alps, but 30 minutes in the Scottish highlands.  Matthew Lee summed up his whole experience with this line, ""maybe we should...find a pub?""

After a while, the pontificating felt extremely vapid, almost laughable.  Unable to buy into the trip to begin with, it was even harder to listen to the musings of the riders.

""RTD"" is excellent.  ""RTP"" - not so much.",1394150400,2,1061,4.73224043715847
5242765,3,B0091TI7LA,"The beginning was so slow and confusing.....the ending sequence was great. Everything in between was uneven. Interesting content but it really needed a much better editor/producer to take it down to maybe 40 minutes. Also, the central premise of ""reveal the path"" wasn't clearly stated by strong voices....rather it tried to creep through.

5242766,5,B0091TI7LA,"I am currently planning my own adventure and happy to find this movie. The greatest thing an adventure movie can do is challenge me. This one taught me, tempted me, and challenged me. Loved the philosophical mix with the physical. Well worth whatever the charge.

No one can actually 'Reveal the Path' but they did show me how they found the door. If you are into the outdoors you will enjoy this movie.",1383782400,,403,4.52054794520548

5242769,2,B0091TI7LA,"I was super excited to see this movie...  Ride the Divide was amazing, this was like the home movie version of a sequel wanna be.  Smart marketing for a poor movie.  Worth a watch if you can see it for free, otherwise don't bother.",1370822400,,231,4.204545454545454
5242770,2,B0091TI7LA,"I'd looked forward to seeing Reveal the Path as I've enjoyed Ride the Divide very
much and have watched it more than once. I have to say that 'Path' isn't the sequel I'd
hoped for - for me the biggest problem with the movie is that the only rides
we're shown seem to be daytrips or maybe overnighters (it's never made clear)
making this no more interesting than any other mountain bike vacation in a
scenic place. Freeride movies follow a similar format but they have stunning
action, pumping soundtracks and some humor along the way. In Path the scenic
shots are overlaid with a voiceover that consists of relentless pseudo-philosophising
about personal growth and finding the path, which (for me) just became tedious
after a while.

As a small plus the DVD extras include Kurt Refsnider showing us his bike and
bikepacking setup, a beautiful, fully rigid titanium Salsa and Kurt seems like a
down-to-earth individual far removed from the waffle of the
main feature narrative.

I hope a bike manufacturer will sponsor Matthew Lee and/or Kurt Refsnider to race
La Ruta de los Conquistadores in Costa Rica and Mike Dion to make a documentary
film about their trip - that would be a fitting sequel to Ride the Divide,
sorry folks, but Reveal the Path ain't it.",1367366400,,1258,4.739726027397261

5242773,1,B0091TI7LA,"I am sorry to say-do not waste your money on this film. I am a big fan of Ride the Divide and have been looking forward to Reveal the Path for months. I just sat through one hour, thirteen minutes, and 28 seconds of this movie and I have absolutely no idea what it was about. There is no story, I have no idea (beyond the country) where they were riding, there was no info about the people they encountered, no info about the journey, the history, the landscape, the bikes, the riders.... The production quality is low, the dialog sound in particular. It actually seems like the somewhat random discarded out-takes of a home movie about a cycling trip. I loved Ride the Divide and the concept for this film and hope they work on more cycling films in the future but seriously, please buy a microphone and a tripod and try again.",1360108800,2,828,4.383116883116883
5242774,4,B0091TI7LA,"I am interested in learning about bike packing but inexperienced. I found it interesting to see the insights of riders with different experience levels and the responses to challenges met. Pretty neat footage, cinematography. Unlike the divide film there was little cohesion or clarity of goals other than to tour. The existentialism is not well conveyed leaving viewers less inspired and more confused.",1360108800,2,403,5.412698412698413
5242775,5,B0091TI7LA,"Straight out, I LOVED this movie. It speaks directly to me, as it echoes the way I feel about life and the way I like to travel.

The message in this movie is fairly straightforward; live in the moment...see the way people live in other parts of the world...don't wait for tomorrow to do it.

I enjoyed the intimate feeling of sitting around the campfire, huddling under a canopy during a downpour, or whichever setting they were in. You felt like this was YOUR trip as well.

For those reviewers who trashed the movie because there wasn't enough riding, or enough details about the length or the route they took, all I can say is...you missed the point.

I do think that it would have been nice to have some of that info included in the DVD's extra features, but it's not a big deal to me that they left it out.

All in all, I thought the scenery and cinematography was stunning, the musical accompaniment was perfect, and despite a couple of moments where the dialogue was overdone, I thought the movie had great flow.

Highly recommended!",1359676800,3,1041,4.51063829787234
5242776,2,B0091TI7LA,"My wife and I have been waiting for a movie that shares the inspiration of traveling via bicycle.  Unfortunately this film only came close in the trailers and previews.

The sound was a problem for us as poorly placed music bites and off mic sounds like crackling fires and pouring rain suppressed much of the dialogue.  The scenery was beautiful and left us asking whens and wheres, but there was little facilitation.  Distances, objectives, even serendipitous encounters with interesting people or creatures were squandered with the lack of much desired story telling.  It was like a Terrence Malick film without the talents of Terrence Malick.  The breaks between 'chapters' were embarrassing and unclever but the only tool in order to distinguish one part of the journey from the next.

As ironic as it sounds the film lacked a direction.  We kept searching for profundity until it became painfully clear that it was absent.  Any intended plot seemed based on some nice bikes, plane tickets and cyclists that were more suited to competition than exploration or reflection.  The film seemed to tell a sleepy story of some experienced cyclists that were awkwardly trying to turn an expensive vacation into something more meaningful.

Why weren't women riders a more substantial part of the film?  The film felt like a bachelor party with adverse weather.  Also, I'm tired of bicycling culture being represented by competitive cyclists.  Matthew Lee looked completely bored and appeared to be dreaming of his next 'ultra' throughout the film- if this was how he looks when he is exhilarated they should have invited somebody else.  The most interesting stories come from people that have yet to overcome their physical challenges and tend to show more humility and growth.

This film is deflating when I imagine what it could have been. It was clumsily arranged and the characters seemed unaffected by the journey.  I appreciate the attempt but we need better stories related to cycling and especially cyclo tourism than this.

Next time you get a budget for a 'genre-defying adventure film' contemplate utilizing resources like the Adventure Cycling Association, track down some seasoned bicycle travelers (the world is covered with them) and then throw in a few more people that have limited experience (the world is covered with them) so we might see that magical glimpse into the trans formative power of a 'bicycle as a mechanism to explore, dream and discover'.",1359158400,20,2468,5.0818858560794045
5242777,2,B0091TI7LA,"I agree with the other reviews here. This was like being invited to someone's house, then they through on their home videos of their vacation. No logical order. One minute, you're in Nepal, about 1 min of actual riding, and to make matters worse, it's on a fire road! Que??, then the next minute you're in some other place? No explanation of a goal or purpose for each place. There's truly only about 20mins worth of actual 'biking' if you want to call it that, broken up by some monotonous conversation with themselves. I think all the bike footage in the movie can be seen in the trailer! Not much action at all, boring. I did like the film 'Ride the Divide', but this one falls WAAAAY short...

5242778,2,B0091TI7LA,"I was a fan of Ride the Divide and was looking forward to another quality film by these guys. The trailer was great and kept me on the lookout for this film. But, the film itself fell a little flat. It seemed like a home video of a group of riders on vacation. There were parts of the film where the sound was messed up and you couldn't hear what was being said and other times where there was no sound whatsoever. Plus, the story line was confusing.. it wasn't clear what the purpose of the ride was and it wasn't that interesting. I would pass on this if you are on the fence.",1358985600,5,578,4.078947368421052
5242779,2,B0091TI7LA,"I had trouble watching this film... It caused me to get restless - as though I could be doing something else with my time.
This is not the wanderlust-inspiring film that Ride the Divide is. There is no human story.
I get that these 4 guys are friends and know each other well, but I don't know them - I know Matt was the former record holder for the Great divide race but other than that, I know nothing. The film does not explain the relationships, or the nuance. I felt like I was on the outside of an inside joke.

The locations are not wholly exotic with the exception of Nepal.. Europe, Alaska, Morocco, eh.

I would estimate that there was about 23 minutes of actual bicycle-riding footage. The rest was spent with voice-overs of attempts to be profound.

Then... it just ends. There is no conclusion, there is no last thought to ponder... just, credits - rolling.",1358208000,4,870,4.459119496855346
5242780,2,B0091TI7LA,"Got this for an Xmas present and was super stoked to watch it.  Was very impressed with Ride the Divide and felt this would be a stellar film as well.  Turns out Hunter Weeks sucks at making movies that don't have distinct linear component.  Sure could have used an intro to Reveal the Path.  They have a good idea of buying 'round the world plane tickets and riding some rad stuff, but beyond that it all pretty much falls apart.  It reminds of that time when me and my buddies had a good idea for a bike trip.  We filmed it and then realized the footage only had relevance to those involved.  So, if you like to see some thrown together footage from someone elses bike trip then this is the movie for you.  If you're Hunter Weeks and you're hoping to make a living on making movies, maybe keep utilizing the maps and character development that you used in ""Ride the Divide"" and ""Where the Yellowstone Goes"".  Those two items would have done wonders to the jumbled mess that is ""Reveal the Path""

Bottom line, spend your money on ""Where the Yellowstone Goes""",1357344000,4,1059,4.412371134020619
5242781,2,B0091TI7LA,"My husband and I decided to rent this because we loved ""Ride the Divide,"" the first film by this crew.

5242783,5,B0091TI7LA,"This is an amazing film to watch on the big screen. You get to see some breathtaking shots of some incredible landscapes, meet some interesting people and get a sense of how spectacular our world is. Paired with an extraordinary soundtrack, the move transports viewers to places they might have only dreamed about.

Reveal The Path does a great job of putting things in perspective. Perhaps the world wouldn't be such a bad place to live, if we all had a chance to ride our bikes around the globe - or, at least, experience it though a great movie like this.

My only criticism of the movie is that there wasn't enough. I was left with wanting to see more destinations, meet more people, and perhaps more self-discovery with the riders. I would love to see a sequel to this expedition.",1356480000,,785,4.560283687943262

I knew then that I would have to ride this race at some point, so I ordered that film and was happy to add Reveal the Path to my order.  Just last night I watched the latter and now find myself again inspired to travel by bike.  I am no stranger to such endeavors, having crossed the US solo in 2005 as I prepared for the 2006 Tour d' Afrique, 8500 miles from Cairo to Cape Town in 4 months.  Now on my shortlist are a crossing of Australia (Perth to Sydney) and the Divide Race.  Thanks for stoking the fire and for the very helpful extra on The Path where Kurt explains the logistics of his bike and packs.  Nice touch!",1351296000,2,693,4.021897810218978
5242787,3,B0091TI7LA,"Having received this film in the mail yesterday.  I was excited.  Even Facebook'd that it arrived. Maybe I set the bar too high.  What I expected was a better, more thought provoking global version of Ride the Divide.  The film misses in many cases.  It does not outline the clear route.  It does not account for how many miles or even days that were spent on the bike.  There are many clear opportunities for amazing bike footage and it does not exist.  When Matthew Lee rides the Alpe d'Huez on a loaded mountain bike the film compresses this great feat into about 25 seconds.  There are great scenes that are really enjoyable in Morocco and Nepal yet no real mention about distance. At one point in morocco the film shows a SUV driving the bikes to a shooting location.  It appears that the team spent only days in each location... Yet I don't want to believe this to be true.

Having backpacked through Grindelwald, I expected the group to at least ride from Interlaken to Grindlewald, which is common, but the group took the train. Great footage from below the Eiger but that's a single day of riding... then boom the group is off to Africa.

Did the film give me a mad case of wanderlust?  YES.  Could it have been edited better to appease the analytical side of an avid cyclist. YES.",1351036800,11,1290,4.48068669527897
5242788,2,B0091TI7LA,"I can't believe how bogus these reviews are.  This film is a very well done vacation video/infomercial.  The personalities in this film face no real challenges, they're just a few popular cyclists on vacation . . . well, you can't really call Hunter Weeks a cyclist.  It's interesting how Hunter, the camera guy, puts his own face in the film multiple times to talk about how amazing the other riders are. He appears to do this to fill time since he can't a catch up with them to get real footage.  The Salsa Cycles sponsorship of this film is overt and taints the ""independent"" feel - it's very apparent that Salsa footed the bill for this thing and wants the viewer to know it.

People look at the cover/poster and automatically think this is a cycling film, which is true, but I like to say that really it is a film about life that just happens to take place on a bike.

Watching this film re-ignited that spark for adventure in me that had started to fade. Now I look towards life as the adventure I want to have not a set of circumstances that will happen around me.

After watching 'Reveal the Path', I just can't think of a convincing reason why I should turn the bike around and head back home. A short 15-mile route has grown into a 3-hour exploration. My Saturday morning ride has transmogrified into an all-day mission to uncover new roads and old memories. Without questio, it's all their fault. I have an idea for their next film.

Reveal the Path has more interesting biking in more interesting surroundings, but the flaw of not commenting on what route they were taking how long it took them to travel, etc, really mars this.  Are they trying to artistically recreate a sense of aimless wandering?  If so, it's a lame idea because you can bet the riders weren't wandering aimlessly...they had rigorous route and supply issues to deal with, none of which is dealt with in the film. I keep wanting to see the bicycle version of Ewan McGregor's outstanding ""Long Way Round"" but that film has yet to be made.  The spiritual brotherhood of man stuff will only carry the viewer so far...we all get that already.  What I want to know is where are you, where are you going, how are you re supplying, who are your sponsors, how many calories do you need to take in, etc.  None of that made it into the film, if it was ever filmed to begin with.

It would have been great to see more mountain biking, likeable people with humor and depth, and a better flow of scenery and geographical changes.",1403481600,,504,4.872093023255814
