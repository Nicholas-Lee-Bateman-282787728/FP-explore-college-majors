4194559,5,B003U6SJZO,"There are three stories that flow together all surrounding the upcoming First Frost, and ending with the Glimmerberry Ball.  I had to give it five stars because my four year old loved it, and I loved that it doesn't have anything offensive in it.  No one is rude or calls each other names. There are no references to pop culture.  Everyone is supportive of one another, and it's just a sweet simple movie for young girls to enjoy.

4194628,4,B003U6SJZO,"Remember Strawberry Shortcake from the 80's with the giant head, sad hat, and terrible songs? Well she still has the big head but this modern version looks and sounds much better! Animation is pretty good, and it has a modern tone without snotty attitudes (ie the new My Little Pony). What I really like is it is one long story (about 90 min) but is broken up into segments that each stand alone. This makes it perfect for when I need a short distraction for my 2 year old, or when I need it for a long drive. My daughter loved her first Bright Lights Big Dreams so much I bought two more.

It was in the very last few minutes of the movie and only lasted for seconds.  Because of the title, they expected to see a ball with girls in pretty dresses dancing around.  It just seemed like a poor title for the movie.",1290988800,17,384,4.366197183098592
4194638,3,B003U6SJZO,"Typing on behalf of my 2 and 5 year old daughters, they would say...we love this movie! We love anything Strawberry Shortcake.

But since I""m the one typing, I will say, the movie itself is fine, but I HATE the new strawberry shortcake. Hate the new look, hate the new toys, hate the new voice, hate the new movies.  I think I made my point.  Why do they always have to change a good thing? There was NOTHING wrong with the old strawberry shortcake, why did they change her, make her super itty bitty, give her a less friendly voice, and go back to making Custard the cat not talk? We always love a talking pink cat.

On a positive note...Angel Cake is gone...I remember as a child, she was my FAVORITE I loved her hair, clothes, smell, just thought she was really neat...but in the previous SS cake movies she was, as my 5 yr old describes her, bossy and whiney..which always made me angry they did that to her. In the new SScake series, they have eliminated the character and seem to have used Lemon to fill her spot.  No more Huck or Purple Pieman, or Sour Grapes, which kinda made us sad.  There is no true trouble maker in Berry Bitty City anymore which may be seen as a plus for the new ones and better for viewing by younger children.

Anyway, if your kids love SS, they will love this movie, and prob the new doll they sell to go with it.

UPDATE: I have to edit my review...after watching the new shows on the new kids channel..The Hub; I have to admit, that the new Strawberry Shortcake is growing on me, though it did take awhile. Actually, my daughter is starting to lose interest in her, funny how that works!",1287446400,17,1622,4.295081967213115
