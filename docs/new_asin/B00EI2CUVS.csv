5915060,5,B00EI2CUVS,I was really fortunate to have been able to watch Peter Gunn as a child. He really impressed me as one of the coolest smooth operating heroes of his day. The last season was so action packed that I am surprised that the show was not picked up for another season. This DVD series is a must for true Peter Gunn fans. You will discover like I did that it is well worth the cost!!,1391472000,4,376,4.026666666666666
5915061,5,B00EI2CUVS,"Well mastered, and a treat for those who enjoy the action and adventure contained in this classic television series.

Cary Grant-esque, cool and suave - that's the persona of Craig Stevens in this detective series created by Blake Edwards and featuring in the soundtrack the jazz undertones of a young Henry Mancini.

For the purist, Timeless Media Group did a much better job obtaining quality transfers of this and Edwards's other series, Mr. Lucky... as opposed to the myriad of prints they needed to use in order to compile the complete M Squad series with Lee Marvin.",1385856000,7,572,4.88659793814433

8605425,4,B00EI2CUVS,"Remember it well - got into ""jazz"" as a result of the show sound tracks of this (Henry Mancini) and of the many ""cop"" theme shows of the period. And very good film quality as well!",1435622400,,180,4.027777777777778
8605426,3,B00EI2CUVS,"What happened.? Gone is ""Mothers"" (a tired-looking Edie has opened her own place). Gone are Gunn's quirky friends except for the pint-sized pool shark. Gone are the rain-soaked streets at midnight (many episodes are set in Mexico). Gone are the on-screen appearances by the likes of Shelley Mann, Shorty Rogers, Pete Candoli, Laurindo Almeida, etc.. and missed most of all: Wilbur, the beatnick. It all seems lack-lustre. Don't get me wrong, I love this series and the first two seasons were fantastic but something is missing the third time around. I'm not surprised they packed it in after this one.

That being said, we also have a picture quality issue. This happens when too many episodes are squeezed in over only 4 discs. One disc even jams because of this. If you would like the first two seasons of this classic show then I would suggest buying the British FIVE-disc sets distributed by ""Liberation"" and available from amazon.uk. I've had no problem with those.",1425081600,5,970,4.914634146341464

8605428,2,B00EI2CUVS,I ordered this set last year in October but couldn't watch it until now. The first 2 discs were great but the third one would not play. Unfortunately Amazon will not allow me return it for an exchange because the time to do so has expired. Just wanted the people to know that sometimes a disc is gimped.,1411171200,3,303,4.241379310344827
8605429,5,B00EI2CUVS,"Cases of a private eye played by Craig Stevens as the title character. It was probably the first suave,sophisticated and cool private eye show to catch the public's attention on TV.It had a score from Henry Mancini and it hit the top twenty charts when it was recorded  by Duane Eddy in the early sixties. Created by Blake Edwards of ""The Pink Panther"" films.
Gunn hung out a place called Mother's and had a girlfriend called Edie played by Lola Albright who performed at Mother's. In the third and final season of which this is, Edie got a nightclub of her own and called it Edie's. Herchel Barnardi played Gunn's police lieutenant friend Jacoby who came in very handy at times as he seemed to get Gunn out of a lot of sticky situations like being beaten up,shot,clobbered over the head etc. There is a complete set of this show out there but I bought this final season as I had already bought the first two seasons years ago and did not want to spend money buying the complete set of DVD's over again.
Shot in black and white it lends atmosphere to this cool series.",1408320000,4,1068,4.448979591836735
8605430,5,B00EI2CUVS,"Peter Gunn is perhaps the greatest of the nocturnal crime/detective shows---oh, there are occasional day shots (particularly in the ones where he goes to Mexico), but mostly the action seems to be at night. The relationship between Gunn and Edie is ahead of it's time for the '50s, which didn't have a lot of shows where the hero had a hot steady girlfriend that he was not yet married to, and where it was at least implied that their relationship was pretty intense. In Season 3 Mother is gone, as Edie opens her own nightclub (with a maitre'd, Leslie, added as a regular). Episodes still very good and suspenseful.",1392854400,4,616,4.660550458715596
