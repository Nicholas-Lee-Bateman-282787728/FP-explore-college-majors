8292440,5,B001DAVTGK,"Caltrain, the San Francisco to Gilroy regional rail system, is one of the oldest passenger rail operations in the western United States, tracing its origins back to October 18, 1863. The original operator, San Francisco and San Jose Railroad Company, was eventually absorbed into the Southern Pacific system which operated the Peninsula Commute Service for years, until deficits forced ""the Friendly"" to transfer responsibility to San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. The counties, working with California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), took over the service with SP remaining the contract operator. These counties would eventually form the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board and buy the San Francisco-San Jose right of way from Southern Pacific. Amtrak replaced SP as contract operator.

The new agreement took effect in 1980, although there were few changes to the equipment for the first few years One GP9 and 3 gallery cars were repainted into an experimental scheme but in 1985, SP's fleet of locomotives and cars was replaced with 18 EMD F40PH-2 locomotives and a batch of Nippon Sharyo stainless-steel gallery cars. Although additional equipment was later procured, this equipment remains in Caltrain's fleet.

Caltrain began tweaking SP's long-established schedule and made incremental improvements. A short southward extension from San Jose to Tamien was followed by an extension of several peak-hour trains to Gilroy in south Santa Clara County. But Caltrain's biggest service upgrade date took place in 2004 when the JPB introduced express service following a massive upgrade of the line and the construction of passing sidings at Lawrence and Bayshore. The timetable was completely rewritten and 6 MPI MP36PH-3C locomotives and 17 Bombardier bi-level cars were introduced to protect the express schedules.

Not long after the new schedule was introduced, Bay Area residents John Abatecola and Dan Cortopassi decided it was time to make their first rail video, which would become Caltrain 2005. Filmed during the first half of the year, before the August schedule upgrade, the video provides viewers with a snapshot of the Caltrain operation as it existed at that time.

The DVD is divided into 13 chapters, organized north to south. Beginning at the San Francisco terminal, chapters include Bayshore, South San Francisco, Millbrae, Burlingame, Hillsdale/Belmont, San Carlos, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, San Jose, Tamien and Gilroy. This last chapter is somewhat misnamed since it also includes footage at Blossom Hill and Morgan Hill. ""South County"" would have been a more inclusive name for this last part.

The DVD opens with a view from the front of the cab car as the train approaches the San Francisco Terminal. The video refers to the terminal as ""4th and King"" rather than the traditional ""4th and Townsend"", unfortunately they are following current Caltrain custom. We see some backlit LRVs on Muni's N-Judah service, which terminates on King Street, before cutting to views of departing and arriving Caltrains.

We then relocate to Bayshore, an ideal location to observe express trains overtaking locals as the latter make their station stops. This location has completely changed since it was the site of SP's main Peninsula yard. We show up before dawn and stick around after the sun comes up to watch the morning rush. We even get to see a vastly overpowered UP freight train with a pair of locomotives hauling a single car. This section concludes with a nice distant view of a southbound train enroute to South San Francisco.

The next chapter, South San Francisco, might have been better filmed in the afternoon to get the best light, but UP switching in the yard adds to the interest. The following segment at Millbrae illustrates another location vastly changed from SP days. A huge new station serving both Caltrain and BART has risen just north of the traditional SP station, with the latter now a museum. Subsequent stops at Burlingame, Hillsdale, San Carlos and Palo Alto provide give the viewer a good overall impression how Caltrain operated in 2005. At Hillsdale, the producers made sure to show the Bay Meadows horse race track in the background. If plans to redevelop this site go through, this will provide a final look at this classic view.

Mountain View is another intermodal station, with Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority LRVs terminating at a platform adjacent to Caltrain's. After a quick look at VTA, we see Caltrain's Mountain View operation, where a replica SP station has recently replaced the ugly cinderblock shelter that was there for decades.

After Mountain View, we set up at the historic Santa Clara station, a busy location where we observe Caltrain, Amtrak, UP and Altamont Commuter Express [ACE] trains. We see a large variety of movements here, although the views of northbound trains are poor because the camera is shooting directly into the sun.

The next chapter focuses on San Jose, the traditional southbound terminal of the Peninsula Commute Service. In addition to the comings and goings of Caltrain, we see a Coast Starlight that had been stuck because of an East Bay derailment, which had just been cleared. The Amtrak P42s run around the train and haul it north and southbound #11 arrives a little bit later.

The final two chapters cover the ""new"" part of Caltrain. The first bit features the new station at Tamien, another location where passengers can transfer to and from VTA's light rail system. We then move on to South County, featuring several views of the new southern terminal at Gilroy.

This video is ideal for passenger train fans. We get to see an operation that has changed in many ways from the classic SP era. There is thorough narration throughout the DVD that explains Caltrain's operation and identifies trains. This reviewer only noticed two mistakes. The first involved the name ""Mayfield"", which is the historic name of California Avenue station, not Palo Alto as indicated. The second occurred at Santa Clara, where the southbound Coast Starlight was misidentified as a Capitol train. Perhaps the narrator was confused by the Starlight's appearance so close to its scheduled time.

Overall, this DVD provides a good look at modern Caltrain. The railroad's management was impressed enough with the results that they profiled Abatecola and Cortopassi in the ""Caltrain Connection"" newsletter. The reviewer viewed the program three ways: on a projection DVD system, a PC and a Sony Bravia 40-inch LCD HDTV. For the optimal viewing experience, the TV was by far the best.

This DVD will only become more valuable with the passage of time, particularly if the line's ever electrified. Years from now people will be watching it to remember what the peninsula was like in the ""good old days"".",1275436800,3,6826,5.165610859728507
