4459885,5,B004RA7YGC,"Vi Warshawski is about a private detective, and woman who is a great detective with hilarious moments doing a serious job, the best for Kath. Turner.  love straight Talk with Dolly Parton. (as a DJ)  Big Business with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin are a riot as 2 sets of long lost twins swithed at birth, now meeting as adults. vendor was great",1354924800,,344,4.444444444444445
4459886,3,B004RA7YGC,"These are movies from my youth, fun to watch on rainy afternoons and you want to get lost in simple style movies.",1354579200,,113,4.181818181818182
4459887,5,B004RA7YGC,this group of movies is excellent choice of grouping. all of the stars are extremely funny. i've always been a great fan of bette and dolly.so don't hesitate order it.,1349568000,,167,4.6
4459888,5,B004RA7YGC,Good Films! Mostly girls stuff tho! They were all good for a heavy dose of the 80's fashion! Probably won't be able to find them all together like this again.,1349136000,,158,4.3
4459889,5,B004RA7YGC,This is a great movie.....Dolly Parton has alot of good 1 liners to remember I like most of her movies anyway  Thanks,1347062400,,117,4.318181818181818
4459890,5,B004RA7YGC,"I was actually looking for Dolly Parton movies.  Saw Straight Talk on television long ago and wanted to see it again.  This movie gets 5 stars for the story and acting. I'm a fan of Dolly and James Woods.  If you don't like either of them, then this movie probably gets only 3 stars.

Got this particular DVD set because it also had V.I. Warshawski, which was the only major Kathleen Turner movie that I never saw.  i would give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.  Bette Midler is great in Big Business and I give that movie 4 out of 5 stars.

All three movies are 1.78:1 Widescreen versions.",1343260800,,580,4.218181818181818
4459891,5,B004RA7YGC,"I love straight talk, but the other movies were a bonus. and when i watched big business it was such a great movie!",1340928000,,115,4.043478260869565
4459892,4,B004RA7YGC,"I picked this up for $5.49 with free shipping. Three movies on two discs. I'm not a fan of the double-sided disc format, but haven't had any problems, so far. The movies themselves are typical 80's fare. However, I don't really care for V.I. Warshawski; something about it just bothers me. In Big Business, Bette Midler does this thing with her eyes where she makes them go from regular size, to really big and then back again. By my count, she does this 117 times. It's a little distracting but also kind of funny/amusing. The films look and sound alright considering their age and overall I'm glad I bought this set.",1340236800,,618,4.576576576576577
4459893,4,B004RA7YGC,I haven't see the VI Warshawski yet so I can't comment on it..though Kathleen Turner is awesome so it's probably good stuff.. but Straight Talk and Big Business are two of my favorite movies!! So funny! hilariouS!! They don't make movies like they used to!,1333670400,3,256,4.711111111111111
4459894,5,B004RA7YGC,"IS STRAIGHT TALK  IN WIDESCREEN?  LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  I BOUGHT THE BLU RAY AT TARGET FOR 4.75!!!!

  UPDATE:  I bought the triple feature for 5.56  All movies  ARE  1:78:1 WIDECREEN!!!  so far the transfer for Straight Talk looks good,some grain here and there,but better than the full frame touchtone dvd.  Hope this helps",1305072000,7,322,4.867924528301887
4459895,3,B004RA7YGC,"I bought this three-movie disc for ""Big Business.""  It seemed that some of the original movie had been cut, but I still enjoyed it immensely.
""Strait Talk"" was pretty good but I couldn't even watch V.I. Warshawski more than 15 minutes, it was so bad.",1461628800,,250,4.555555555555555
4459896,5,B004RA7YGC,"This review is for BB alone. I didn't watch the other two. It was cheaper to buy a triple feature. Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin are at their best in this movie. They are as funny now as they were in the 80s. Funny, quotable lines from start to finish.",1458691200,,251,4.04

The disc doesn't work. At all. And at this point I'm not allowed to return it. So, I can't review this item very positively, since it essentially turned out to be the equivalent of throwing money into the garbage.",1424217600,,346,4.40625

4459924,4,B004RA7YGC,"I'm a huge Bette Midler fan so I may be a little bias for my review of Big Business.  Bette and Lily Tomlin are a hoot in this movie.  A little hint of 80s cheesy effects but very funny nonetheless.

Straight Talk is fun.  Dolly fans will love it!

I haven't watched V.I. Warshawski yet but plan to in the near future.",1387238400,,318,4.064516129032258
4459925,5,B004RA7YGC,"I bought this just for Big Business. I have watched it on tape over and over again throughout the years. Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin are an even match in this movie about two sets of twins who get mismatched at birth. One rich and powerful, the other poor and ""uncitified"". They meet up in NYC and the mix-ups begin.",1381017600,,317,4.3

  I had been looking for quite some time for the movie V.I. Warshawski on DVD.
Then when I saw That all 3 flicks were in one package I couldn't pass it up. Even though
I would have preferred some of the special features on some of the movies, but I feel in the
grand scheme of things I think that is a little ilrevrant. Thanks again for having this to purchase.",1371427200,,386,4.202702702702703

My review philosophy:
As a longtime customer of Amazon, I depend on others' honest reviews. I do my best to provide that same courtesy to others.
I purchase lots of items through Amazon, some I get for free, some I get at a discounted rate, and some I pay full price. I will always disclose if I receive an item for free or a discounted rate. I do a lot of reviews so here is a break down on how I determine my star rating of a product:
5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Don't we all have flaws? I would purchase again.
3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.
2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.
1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and recommend others to not purchase.",1466035200,,940,4.086956521739131

8438798,2,B004RA7YGC,I like the movies.  That is why I bought the disk.  As someone who has hearing issues I like to have subtitles.  There are no subtitles on this DVD at least on the Straight Talk movie.  I don't know why it isn't put up front on items like this one that they do not have subtitles  It is so annoying.,1461801600,,299,3.9166666666666665
