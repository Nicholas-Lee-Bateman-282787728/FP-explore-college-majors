438537,2,6302221579,"Tim Thomerson stars as Brick Bardo, the ""Dirty Harry"" of the planet Arturos located 10,000 light years away. Arturos is one of those odd planets with a parallel development to that of Earth, down to the English language with slang. While chasing a bad guy (one that is just a flying head) the enter some undefined force field which causes them to crash land in the South Bronx at a time when chain smoker Kamala Lopez is trying to rid her neighborhood of drugs. Bardo is only 12 inches tall on this planet and instantly gets the nickname ""Dollman"" as he aids Kamala against a gang.

If you recall the special effects in ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" they didn't get any better for this film. The movie was good on Arturos, but once they come to Earth, it spins its wheels. Not really worth a watch unless all you have are Asylum of Tempe videos.

438541,3,6302221579,"When I was a growing up in the early 90's Full Moon films were some of my favorite things to rent at the video store. At that time in the 90's Full Moon was pumping out very high quality direct to video material in form of Puppet Master, Subspecies, Trancer sequels, and of course Dollman and Demonic Toys. Though Full Moon Entertainment still exists today pumping out really crappy films, their early offerings still are guilty pleasures of mine. Yes I am a Full Moon fan. I'm not happy to admit it, but their early films still hold a special place in my black heart.

Most fans today know about the situation Full Moon has with their old distributor Paramount Pictures. Paramount still holds the rights to Full Moon's old movies and will not allow Full Moon to release them on DVD. This is why the Puppet Master box was pulled from the market. For years their earlier (and FAR better films) never saw the light of day but thankfully Charlie Band found a way to get a round the system. He started releasing some of the early films as ""Australian imports"". What I find funny is that Australia is Region 4/Pal but the Australian imports are Region 0/NTSC. Fishy, Fishy but I'm still glad Band was able to get his films to fans.

Though these films are finally coming out on DVD...not is all well. All these films seem to be laserdisc rips (or in the Subspecies box set case...VHS!). My guess is that Paramount holds the original reels so Band/Full Moon can only use the sources they have available. The second problem with the releases of these older films is DVD glitches. The Subspecies box set was loaded with glitches that made it hardly worth fans throwing out their old VHS tapes.

Those of you that were upset with the Subspecies box set have nothing to fear hear. As far as I can tell the only ""glitch"" is two instances of audio drop-out on the Dollman DVD. This is very minor and should not detract you from getting this set. The Demonic Toys DVD surprisingly has a fantastic transfer. I was shocked when I first watched it. I just wish I liked the film more as I always found it to be one of the weaker earlier Full Moon outings. Dollman, on the other hand, has always been one of my favs of Full Moon. Tim Thomerson plays a Jack Deth-like clone named Brick Bardo. Bardo is a tough alien cop who crash-lands on Earth where he is only 13 inches tall. Dollman vs. Demonic Toys is a hoot of a film. It's a cheapy franchise tie-in that barely runs over an hour long but I still had a ball watching it.

Other than the original videozones that originally appeared on the VHS releases, these discs have nothing in the special feature departments. Still the quality is better than expected (especially if you bought the Subspecies box set) so the films are definitely worth ""upgrading"" to DVD if you are a fan of the films. The box set can be hard to find as it not released in chain stores but you can find it to buy on Full Moons official website.",1155513600,11,2951,4.419117647058823

But when a high-speed space chase lands him in the middle of a gang war in the Bronx, Brick Bardo (TIM THOMERSON) is in a class of his own--he's thirteen inches tall and is armed with the deadliest weapon man has ever seen.
As always, Brick has perfect timing: he lands just in time to save a streetwise woman from a scorching death at the hands of some drug thugs. She's Debi Alejandro (KAMALA LOPEZ) and she's ruffled the feathers of the wrong group of people in her fight to clean up the neighborhood.
Debi takes Brick under her wing and he joins her crusade to eliminate drug lord Braxton Red (JACKIE EARLE HALEY). Now Brick is known as DOLLMAN...a criminal's deadliest nightmare.",1026691200,4,746,4.616541353383458

438601,4,6302221579,"DOLLMAN  From Full Moon Video which is now on DVD with it's sequel Doll Man vs. Demonic Toys on a double Dvd purchase is pure gold as far as Charles Band's company was going back in the late 80's and 90's. Tim Thomerson who I was very lucky to meet at a film show told me many stories about the Dollman movies and even told me that he took some of the large Demonic Toys props home that Full Moon gave him to take home to his family who were young children at the time. DOLLMAN mixes science fiction with the cruel gangs of the street on this planet and pits a pint size star with a big heart against giants doing harm to young innocent people. Giants to him because he is only 6 inches high on this planet. Jackie Earle Haley plays the sinister leader of the street gang, and does a great job just being mean.
Ok the special effects are not super but the miniatures play well,it's well made and a fun movie from Full Moon. Check it Out.

438602,3,6302221579,"With a name such as DOLLMAN it's not difficult to understand why this movie never left much of a mark on its genre; however, it still holds up today as a great cult fantasy thriller. Hilarious, and almost clever tongue-in-cheek dialogue, for such a low budget horror film. There is much to be appreciated here. Worth the watch if you're a true fanatic.",1340928000,,352,4.603174603174603

7822594,4,6302221579,"Mr. Band and Mr. Thomerson do it again. A fun ride and an enjoyable B movie. Say what you want about Full Moon Ent they usually have original ideas which is what is sorely lacking in many movies with budgets that dwarf Dollmans. One of the main problems that I have with Band's movies is that they never long enough, usually they top out at about an hour and change which is never enough time to really fully get into it. So, leave your expectations at the door and get ready for some fun...SMALL TIME!!!  :)",1519948800,,508,4.291666666666667

7822597,3,6302221579,"BOTTOM LINE: Not great but not awful, there are a few showstring thrills to be had, if you like these kinds of films. And for what it's worth, the title character did have enough appeal to warrant a semi-sequel/crossover, (DOLLMAN vs. DEMONIC TOYS). There's a lot of unnecessary (for my tastes) vulgarity, just for the sake of vulgarity. It's violent too, but nothing really out of the ordinary for an Empire film. If you're unsure, you may want to stream or rent first, unless you're just gonna buy a used copy for cheap. 3 STARS

THE STORY: Mouthy, rule-breaking alien police detective Brick Bardo (Tim Thomerson) is pursuing an escaped megalomaniac super-criminal (who's nothing but a floating, psychotic severed head!) across the galaxy, when an accident crashlands them both in a seedy, crime-ridden neighborhood here on Earth. Bardo still has to get his man, errr... head... errr... whatever, but there's a catch: this tough-talking macho cop is only a foot tall on our world. Lowbrow no budget hijinks ensue, as the determined diminutive detective tracks his bizarre bite-sized quarry thru the slums of New York.

THOUGHTS: I bought this movie for 2 reasons: Tim Thomerson & the Wildey semi-auto handcannon his character uses throughout the film. (The .45 WinMag Wildey hunting pistol - as portrayed here - literally blows up anyone shot with it, which makes for a couple of amusing gross-out gags.) A teenaged Jackie Earl Haley is criminally wasted in a one-dimensional throwaway role, playing a neighborhood punk who imagines himself as something more. He does some respectable emoting (most notably towards the end), but essentially just struts around yelling & swearing. The female rolls are mostly stereotypes as well. Working class leading man Thomerson makes the most of his role, but the tissue-thin script doesn't leave much for him to work with. Everything about this movie screams super-low budget; typical of an Empire/Charles Band flick. Part of the charm, I suppose. The basic premise has lots of potential but most of this goes untapped, as the film's Lamborghini-class concepts are ultimately hamstrung by its Yugo-level budget. Judging by the fiberboard spaceship sets, I'd say most of the microscopic F/X budget went towards the make-up for the floating head badguy.

THE BLU-RAY: This hi-def release of DOLLMAN looks respectably decent, for a back-of-the-video store Empire Pictures flick. Video portion is clear and fairly sharp and the audio track is mostly clean. However, the picture does contain some artifacting, pixelation and video noise (""crush""), especially in lowlight scenes. There are a handful of bonus features to up the value, but ultimately whether or not you want to pony up for this will depend on just how much a fan you are of Full Moon/Empire flicks, Tim Thomerson, and/or trashy 80's cinema.",1503187200,3,2840,5.142857142857143
