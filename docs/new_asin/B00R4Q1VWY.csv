8694107,1,B00R4Q1VWY,"BEWARE! I have waited for this film to be available on DVD for years. When I saw the listing, I ordered immediately. The quality is incredibly poor with washed out color and is out of focus for the entire film. Even youtube has a better qualtiy print. This DVD would seem to have worked from a VHS tape recorded from television. Do not purchase this if you want a good viewing experience.",1424304000,3,388,4.402777777777778
