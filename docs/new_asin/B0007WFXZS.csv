8052710,1,B0007WFXZS,Ended up in the trash same day I bought it. Worst movie ever! The description made the movie sound way more interesting than it is. I was bored out of my mind. I really thought it would get better but it did not. The characters have no personality. It is painful to watch. This guy ends up sleeping around on his wife. And she ends up having an affair. That is about all that happens. I will think twice before purchasing a movie when nobody else has written a review yet.,1258070400,,472,4.197802197802198
