7855449,5,6303929729,"Gargoyles a one of the greatest animated television series.  I'm still a little disappointed that the show was taken off of the air, and just when the plot line was really interesting.  It's like mixing the Ninja Turtles in with Disney's Beauty and the Beast (reference was not hard to recognize by the way).
I'm seriously hoping that the entire series, both Gargoyles and Gargoyles: the Goliath Cronicles, will be released on DVD soon.  It's been almost ten years since the series premiered, so it should be time.",1090195200,7,514,4.818181818181818
7855450,5,6303929729,"Gargoyles is probably one of the greatest cartoons of all time, if only it had stayed on for just a few more seasons, I know that it would have drawn  even more fans.  Betrayed by Xanatos, who the Manhattan gargoyles had  thought was their friend, Goliath and the remaining gargoyles of his clan  must fight to defend themselves and their friends, from the threats of the  modern world.  At the same time, they have Xanatos and his plots to contend  with.  Robotic gargoyles, a former friend and love, turned cold hearted  assasin, journeys into the distant past, and a sprinkling of well thought  out humor make this, and all Gargoyles episodes, a delight for all ages, no  matter what your tastes, Gargoyles has something for you!",965088000,21,732,4.73015873015873
