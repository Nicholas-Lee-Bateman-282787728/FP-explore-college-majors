3854063,5,B0026K9IZ0,My partner and I recieved this DVD as a gift. We both have had back pain in the past and I had surgery to remove a ruptured disk nine years ago. The routines offered in this program are a great supplement to the other stretching and aerobic exercises we do. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Having a choice of longer or shorter routines is great too.,1253059200,8,364,4.2898550724637685
3854064,5,B0026K9IZ0,"The last time I injured my back (by merely bending over) I knew I needed to find a way to strengthen my back. I was in pain and semi-incapacitated for over a month. Yoga Therapy for Back Pain is my salvation and I have incorporated it into my daily routine. I have focused on the General Back and the Bulging Disk routines and I especially like having the option of routine length. With Emily's guidance I feel I have found a safe, gentle and relaxing way to end each day knowing I am conditioning my back against future injury.",1240963200,38,528,4.343434343434343
3854065,5,B0026K9IZ0,This really helps me.  It is gentle enough that I do not hurt afterwards.  It targets so many areas and I feel marvelous when I finish it.,1439164800,,138,4.074074074074074
3854066,5,B0026K9IZ0,I practice this DVD  nightly to wind down and feel better.  The moves are easy to follow and safe for my back.  My back has never felt better and it has certainly helped me.  I can't recommend this dvd enough.  It is worth it and you won't be sorry.,1439078400,,249,4.0

3854073,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I am a certfied yoga instructor and someone who has dealt with back pain. In my opinion, this DVD is wonderful for beginners and for anyone with back pain. The slow pacing helps the poses to be effective (so that your muscles relax). The sequences can be done even if you just have a short time to devote to it, which is the case for many busy people. I like the DVD so much that I've bought a few and given them to friends and family. The sequences are very thoughtfully and intelligently planned.",1433289600,3,498,4.308510638297872
3854074,5,B0026K9IZ0,Great DVD and instruction really helps lower back pain.,1429228800,,55,5.222222222222222
3854075,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I like this DVD a lot, but let me give you a little background first. I have had low back, hip, S-I joint pain increasing the past 10 years. I have been diagnosed with arthritis, polymyalgia and fibromyalgia. I tried chiropractor, accupuncture and physical therapy. Most recently I was referred to a pain specialist who did steroid shots to the S-I joints and then more 6 more shots to 3 low lumbar joints. None helped substantially. My family doctor then told me the next step was a neurosurgeon. That's when I drew a line - no surgery. So I bought 3 different DVD's from Amazon, all highly rated. Two were yoga for the back and one was for sciatica exercises. This DVD 'Yoga Therapy for Back Pain' has easily become my 'go to' favorite. I like the instructor's method & voice. It's simple English - no hard to pronounce Indian pose names. It shows 2 ways to do the exercises, so those with less flexibility & strength can pick which is right for them. It has a 15 minute and a 30 minute version for each back area routine. I have been using it regularly for about 1 1/2 months. It is a slow process strengthening weak muscles and stretching tight ligaments, but I am feeling some positive results - fewer really bad back pain days. I don't believe this or any other DVD could cure me quickly. I feel it may take a life-long commitment to yoga, but a life with less pain would be worth it. You will need several yoga accessories to do the various poses. It calls for a yoga strap, 2 blocks & a bolster cushion. I find I don't really need a mat. The carpet seems just fine. A folded blanket vs. a bolster cushion would probably suffice too. If you've read this far then you're probably dealing with serious pain like me. Try yoga, not just on & off for a week or two, but regularly for several months. Then you'll have a good idea if it can help you. Good luck.",1425081600,29,1861,4.335243553008596
3854076,4,B0026K9IZ0,A pretty simple routine that did not aggravate my chronic back pain.  Easy to follow instructions.  Really good for a beginner.  I enjoyed the sequence of moves.,1423180800,,161,4.888888888888889

3854078,5,B0026K9IZ0,"Gentle yoga for everyday. This slow-paced DVD is perfect for those of us with serious back issues. I have a condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis which has caused fusing to take place in my lower back and sacro joints. Keeping flexible is very important so yoga was recommended to me by my rheumatologist. This DVD is my favorite of all the different ones I've tried. I can even use it on days when I am in great pain, but still need to keep my muscles and joints moving. Yes, it's slow paced, but when you're in pain, the slow transitions are welcome. They also show you modified versions in case you're not very flexible.  I love being able to choose from the different routines. Some are very similar, but all are beneficial. The instructor, Emily has a very calming voice, and explains each position well. Every time I finish a routine from the DVD I am more relaxed and my back feels better.",1422230400,,898,4.54320987654321

3854086,5,B0026K9IZ0,"This DVD by Emily Kligerman, Yoga Therapy for Back Pain is an excellent source for those individuals who are looking for a more gentle style of yoga.  I found the directions clear and easy to follow!",1386288000,,199,4.527777777777778
3854087,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I have chronic pain and neck issues. This is so gentle, even I can use it. However, it gives you really good stretch and helps with range of motion. Excellent for people with mobility issues who want to expand their range of motion without injuring themselves. Highly recommend.",1384992000,,278,4.8125
3854088,5,B0026K9IZ0,"Its true, the instructor aims to make this yoga DVD one which is safe for even newbies to yoga. She also assumes you are coming into the practice with back issues. This is not a DVD for an intermediate to advanced yogi/yogini who wishes to build back strength (with no back issues); such is not her audience. (If you're a pro with no back issues see neck/back rescue DVD by Desiree Rumbaugh).
Instead, find here stretches/poses which are found nearly across all back yoga DVDs instructed thoroughly, done with modifications (in her counterpart) with a healing basic soundtrack and restful background which allows full focus on the stretches and poses.
As I have done easily half a dozen yoga back DVDs, I can say, this one is unique in its targeted back issue practice - so (5) workouts, which are specifically targeted at 'bulging disc,' 'sciatica,''sacro-illiac joint,'etc (Even more targetted than Barbara Benaugh's 2013 back video, I feel). Each of these is done in a short of 15-17 min OR a longer 30 min workout. Makes it super effective and convenient. ALSO, she gives a quick, thorough intro on research supporting the use of yoga for back issues. Done very well. Also exclusive to this back practice DVD.
Truthfully, I am always skeptical, of any yogi/yogini who states they don't get anything out of this. REALLY? You maintain perfect back posture all day long, have back stretch that runs evenly up and down your spine into hips and neck...all balanced, and never store tension ANYWHERE in your backside nor sit for prolonged periods of time. Really? Wow....dream life!",1381276800,3,1580,4.899253731343284
3854089,3,B0026K9IZ0,"As a fitness instructor, my objective opinion is that this title may be misleading.  The yoga performed in this video is not necessarily anything innovative or original.  Anyone who practices yoga will be familiar with these exercises.  I wouldn't say this is yoga therapy for back pain - it is a regular yoga session that if done properly, will give your body good stretches that are beneficial but not curative so ""therapy"" is a big word.  This is a basic yoga session and perhaps with different setting and/or music it may have at least given the ilusion of being better.",1381017600,,574,4.71
3854090,4,B0026K9IZ0,When your back hurts like a mother this is the DVD for you. SOME moves my body said no to and I do love how they give you modifications. Fairly easy to follow and quite a bit of floor work! I love a mini workout I can do on my back.,1367884800,2,232,3.5686274509803924
3854091,4,B0026K9IZ0,"This is a very thorough and professional DVD for care of the spine.  I've had a back issue after an injury about 24 years ago.  I believe yoga has helped ease my pain.  Instead of having pain 24/7, I can sometimes go for months without any significant symptoms since I started practicing yoga 3 to 4 years ago on a regular basis.  If you're plagued with back issues, try the DVDs in this series.  They are slow paced but not always easy.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star rating is that they are a bit on the boring side and don't have music (compared to my favorite instructor, Rodney Yee).",1361059200,2,602,4.283185840707965
3854092,5,B0026K9IZ0,I find this very helpful with my assortment of back ailments and limited time to do yoga. I bought the accessories and can do the positions in less than one hour. Great product.,1360886400,,177,4.393939393939394
3854093,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I was in my 40's before I discovered yoga.....love it. I've done all kinds of exercise, and this is my favorite. Then I hurt my back. Bought ""yoga for inflexible people"" thinking that would be ok, but some of those poses actually hurt my back (lower, bulging disk) more. So I thought I'd give this a try. It's very relaxing and stretchy. I really enjoy it. you can use props- and they show you how- so that you can do most every pose. There is an introduction series that helps you choose which segment helps you the most. I'm glad I bought this and I look forward to getting back into regular yoga. In fact, some of these move are the exact same as the exercises my chiropractor tells me to do. There are segments for almost (if not) every back pain/injury you can have, plus a meditation segment.

3854095,1,B0026K9IZ0,"I have piriformis/sciatica back pain and bought this CD with hopes of finding some relief. I am a long term yoga practicioner and truly found this tape to be awful. The quality of the sound and the amateuristic editing techniques were both annoying and distracting.

The web description implied a different level of yoga therapy and did not come near living up to the promise. I literally did one 17 min segment and could not wait to send it back. The 17min is probably equal to more like 10 min of poses and instruction. It is a truly hyped product and I returned it. I will probably buy another one with a different more stimulating and professional presentation.

I have purchased a Gary Kraskow and Rodney Yee CD as well and found them to be far superior.",1340496000,16,759,4.532846715328467
3854096,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I found this DVD to be very gentle and about all I could handle with the back issues I was having. It has helped me move past much of that stiffness and my pain level has diminished significantly. I have also been using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Gentle-Practice/dp/B0012KK6QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga: Gentle Practice</a>&nbsp;by Zyrka Landwijt. The combo has helped me to not feel repetitious in the gentle workouts. I use one or both in the evenings and am impressed with how much better I am sleeping at night. Overall, it is very good and effective therapy which I would recommend to someone with hip or back pain significant enough to be an issue. It is a pleasant way to regain flexibility, decrease pain and induce good sleep.

UPDATE: Didn't use my yoga tapes for a long time. Eventually I developed back problems enough to send me into physical therapy for 3 months. I am now back to using them again and have an even greater appreciation for these DVDs. I only hope to be wise enough to continue using them on a regular basis. Thank you, Emily!

3854100,4,B0026K9IZ0,"I'm in my late 40s and have chronic upper and lower back issues. A fanatic jogger, swimmer, and exerciser in my 20s and 30s, I have been inactive for about ten years now, which shows - painfully so!

I like this program because it is not power or weight-loss yoga. There is no drill sergeant-like instructor in a fancy midriff-exposing exercise outfit, and no annoying powerhouse background music. The exercises are easy enough for me to do without feeling like a total loser because I can't twist like a pretzel anymore.

I love the instructor's calm voice and the soothing electronic background music. I enjoy doing the 44 minute ""General Back"" sequence in the evening, after a nice hot shower. It helps relieve my back pain but it is gentle enough for me to be able to sleep afterwards. And if I don't have time to do the whole sequence, I can do any of its five parts separately or combine them any way I like.

The DVD also has a 10 minute meditation and a 20 minute chair session.

All in all, I think this is good value for the money!",1301702400,4,1041,4.40625
3854101,5,B0026K9IZ0,"This is a wonderful, gentle, yoga program for healing and strengthening the back. It is professionally done and includes soothing background music. Each sequence begins with relaxation and conscious breathing and ends with relaxation. The verbal instructions are excellent and the visual demonstrations, with two teachers, who often present a pose along with an easier variation, are very well done. Almost anyone should be able to do these sequences (avoid any that cause pain or increase discomfort from an injury).  Understandably, some advanced yoga practitioners find the poses too basic, but that does not diminish their value for the back. I really like that specific sequences of poses are offered for three low back problem areas (bulging disc, sciatica, sacro-illac joint). There are also sequences for ""general back,"" ""upper back,"" and ""chair practice,"" and a meditation section. Each area of focus (excluding ""chair practice"" and ""meditation"") gives you the option of doing a short sequence of about 15 min. or a longer sequence of about 30 min. (with an additional 44 min. sequence for the ""general back""). Keep in mind that it takes time for healing and strengthening to take place, and for many of ""us"" with back injuries, a regular routine of yoga or exercise may need to be done ""forever.""

Many of these poses are repeated in different sequences. All of the poses for Sacro-Illac Joint (SIJ) can be found on the 31 min. sequence for Bulging Disc. You can, of course, pause the DVD at times and do a longer stretch or add an additional physical therapy stretch. For all the poses on the DVD you will need a yoga mat, a bolster (or equivalent support), a blanket, 2 yoga blocks and a yoga strap. If you have a back injury, you can either do poses only for healing, or you can alternate poses for healing one day with poses for strengthening the back another day.

CREATING YOUR OWN PROGRAM FOR HEALING FROM LOW BACK INJURY:

You can use your DVD remote to skip specific poses and create your own routine. If you chose to, you can create a 45 min. routine that includes all the poses for ""sciatica"" and ""bulging disc"" (which cover the same poses that are also done for ""SIJ""). To assist someone who would like to use this DVD to create a routine of this nature, what follows is a description of each ""skipable"" (with remote) ""chapter"" or ""pose section"" for each of these three areas of focus. I have added three asterisks for the 11 ""pose sections"" that cover all the poses for ""sciatica,"" ""bulging disc"" and, as a result, ""SIJ"" (the first 7 from ""bulging disc"" 31 min. sequence; one in the ""sciatic pain"" 17 min. sequence; and 3 in the ""sciatic pain"" 30 min. sequence). To use this routine, follow the 11 in order, avoiding any that cause pain or are otherwise inappropriate for you. (1 of the 11 poses with asterisks increases my discomfort, so I skip it, which results in a 43 min. routine.) My sequence starts with the beginning relaxation and gentle warm up and ends with the ending relaxation used in all the DVD's sequences. (For my purposes here, I am not focusing on the poses for the ""upper back"" and ""general back"".)

3854102,2,B0026K9IZ0,I was disappointed in this yoga dvd.  Two of the routines were identical as in the same routine under two separate subheadings.  The warmup and cool down were idnetical on at least three of the workouts.  The stretches were well explained.  I liked that there were two versions of each exercise.

3854107,2,B0026K9IZ0,"What a let down. I have spinal injuries & was very excited that there was a video made especially for that. This video is seperated into several different 'workouts' but the truth is, she taped each move once & justs cuts the same video clips in different orders into the session... feels like more time is spent transitioning video clips than actually stretching. There's really only about 3 moves in each 15 minutes. I didn't feel like I'd accomplished anything at all after doing the video's.",1286841600,11,495,4.767441860465116
3854108,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I recently developed recurring low back spasms that caused pain and stiffness and prevented me from enjoying virtually any activity.  Chiropractic adjustments and massage therapy helped but the pain would just return in a day or two.  In the past I've found yoga to be too ambitious for my 50+, stiff body.  But I ordered this DVD based entirely on the Amazon reviews, and because I was desperate and didn't want to take drugs.  When the DVD arrived, I had been in constant pain for three weeks.  After the first session with this DVD, I felt better and in five days, I was no longer in any discomfort.  I resumed walking, dancing and all other activities.  I also felt more relaxed, calm and centered because of the meditative quality of the sessions.  The practice is easy to follow each day, and I really appreciated that I can choose the session length to fit my busy schedule.  I also purchased the Viniyoga DVDs by Gary Kraftsow, but find that I prefer this one so far.  I highly recommend this DVD even if you have no yoga experience, or are concerned that yoga postures will be too difficult.",1281139200,13,1100,4.566326530612245
3854109,5,B0026K9IZ0,"I'm 5 years post micro-discectomy L5/S1, and numbness was working its way back into the affected leg. Started using this DVD every morning about 4 weeks ago, and numbness is mostly gone and overall flexibility noticeably improved. Lower back pain, which has been a minor but nagging issue, is almost all gone.

The DVD offers multiple options with different lengths, so I don't get bored, the pacing is very good, so you have time to really stretch, and the narrator has an awesome voice, so it's fun to listen to. This is a stretching DVD, though, and doesn't really focus on strengthening your back muscles, for which I bought another DVD (Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow). Using the two interchangeably has been great - one day stretching, the next strengthening.

I was passive about my recovery for 5 years - doing lots of aerobics and general weight lifting and stomach work, but very little back-focused stretching or strengthening. These two DVDs have helped me come a long way in a short time, and I'll never be passive about my back again.",1276560000,17,1085,4.76595744680851
3854110,5,B0026K9IZ0,"Absolutely love this program.  This is a restorative yoga practice.  I love that the menu gives you options of various lengths to target specific back issues.  A wonderful educational segment is included.  This is the most effective progam I have found for my back thus far, I have several similiar DVDs.  I'm very glad I made this purchase.  I've found that doing yoga at home is more effective and safer than going to a chiropractor.  Not to mention it is a lot cheaper.",1262822400,10,472,4.614457831325301
3854111,4,B0026K9IZ0,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; a longer version of my review appears on that site.

Yoga Therapy for Back Pain provides a series of gentle, therapeutic yoga practices for back care.  Instructor Emily Klingerman's training is consistent with the tradition of T. Krishnamacharya; her approach is similar to another school of yoga descended from that same yoga master, Viniyoga, in that she incorporates dynamic movement within the postures.  There are a total of 12 asana practices plus a separate meditation segment on this DVD.  The Main Menu of the DVD divides the practices by condition and into routines of varying length as follows:

General Back:  17min--32min--44min

Upper Back:  15 min--30 min

Bulging Disk:  17 min--31 min

Sacro-Iliac Join:  15 min--30 min

Sciatic Pain:  17 min--30 min

Chair Practice:  20 min

Meditation:  10 min

Although the option for different length practices is nice, there is actually NOT quite as much variety as there appears at first glance.  All of the practices are made up of shorter sequences which are strung together, and if you try the the longest routine, the 44-Minute General Back, you have basically done everything that is available on the DVD (with the exception of the Chair and Meditation practices).  All of the practices are filmed in a featureless white studio; soft music plays in the background.  Klingerman teaches via voiceover (she does not mirror-cue), and she is shown practicing alongside fellow yoga therapist Arturo Peal, who displays modifications for some of the postures.  Klingerman recommends the following props to use with the DVD:  a strap, 2-3 blankets, 2 blocks (optional), and a bolster (can substitute blankets).  All of the poses are performed on the floor, in either a reclined, seated, or kneeling position.  The majority of the routines begin with a focus on breathing deeply into belly, and all end with an approximately 2  minute relaxation with the knees over a bolster.

The DVD case states that these practices are designed to ""increase mobility and reduce pain.""  Overall, these exercises would be suitable for a wide audience, providing an excellent means for alleviating pain as well as promoting improved flexibility and range of motion.",1260662400,53,2299,5.151761517615176
3854112,5,B0026K9IZ0,"What a great DVD!! As someone who practices yoga 1-2 times a week, when I injured my back I was saddened that I couldn't keep up with practicing. My physical therapist was giving me exercises and I was also doing a series of exercises from ""Dr Root's No More Aching Back"" book. When I came across this DVD I gaveout a try since I have 2 others from the company. I have found it to be a nice compilation of the gentle stretchs that my PT wants me to do as well as  some of the stretchs from the book all complemented with beautiful relaxing music. The segments are short- 15 min so as
I heal I can build onto them working up to the 30 min segments. Also they are specific for injury which is great- I have stuck to 'General Back Care' and 'SI Joint'. I look forward to adding this to my morning routine, giving myself a 15 min practice before heading out the door! In my opinion this company has found the right combo to make helpful yoga DVDs- once you watch a segment I feel that you can close your eyes and just be in your own place while just listening to DVD. It really is a wonderful and helpful product!",1257292800,13,1109,4.1342592592592595
3854113,4,B0026K9IZ0,"First, I do not recommend video yoga unless you have taken classes from a qualified instructor - this is because an instructor will personally make sure you understand what is meant by various instructions, and how to make the most of a pose.

I am just an amateur, but I find yoga to be very therapeutic both physically and mentally.  At 58, I find that my lower back aches frequently, and I have had neck and shoulder issues for years, due to an old whiplash and being an accountant. My chiropractor always says that I am in better shape whenever I'm doing yoga consistently (which is not during tax busy season!)

What I like about this DVD is that it provides groups of routines for general back health, for the upper back, and then for three specific types of lower back issues.  Each one of these provides two or more routines of increasing length, with the shortest being 17 minutes, and the longest about 45 minutes.  The instructor also goes over the types and symptoms of different back issues in an overview segment, but I checked with my chiropractor to see which lower back routines she thought I should use (she suggested a combination of the routines for disk bulge and for the sacro-iliac joint)(upper back is a given).

This DVD does not provide advanced or difficult poses.  I haven't finished going through all of the longest routines, but the beginning of each seems to be exactly the same for all back issues, and it's extremely gentle.  I have no problem doing the poses as Emily Kligerman does them, which means they are not very extreme, and her video partner illustrates the same poses even more gently than she does them.  Her voice is very nice and soothing and the repetitive background music is also soothing, although clearly the video has been spliced between poses because you can hear the break in the music - this is a minor grouse - it doesn't rise to the level of an annoyance.

You should check with your doctor first, but it seems that this would be a fine DVD for someone who has pretty extreme back pain, because it's so gentle.  I also think this would be excellent for someone in injury recovery even if the injury is not in the back, because any injury involves trauma, and trauma tightens up muscles all over.  I wish I'd had it last year after a bike accident and hip injury - my lower back started hurting from too much sitting around during the recovery, so I think these therapeutic routines would have been an excellent addition to my hip PT.",1253836800,76,2491,4.560538116591928
