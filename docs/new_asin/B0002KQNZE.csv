8028602,1,B0002KQNZE,today is September 12th and I still haven't gotten my movie. I want my money back,1126483200,3,81,4.125
8028603,3,B0002KQNZE,"First off, unlike other reviews have stated, I had no problem playing this DVD, either on my Onkyo DVD player or on my Powerbook laptop.  Either the company has removed the region encoding from later pressings or this DVD just happens to not be playable on all DVD players.  Caveat Emptor.

That being said, this movie is not related to the hit movie ""Shaolin Soccer"" in any way, except for having the same star, Stephen Chow.  In fact, it has nothing to do with martial arts at all; it's merely a re-release of a mediocre film originally produced in 1990, titled ""Shi xiong zhuang gui"" according to the IMDB.

The quality of the print is poor, and the special effects are atrocious.  The producers of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" in the 60's did a better job editing ghosts popping onto the screen than this movie does.  The action sequences that are in this movie are also unentertaining and poorly directed.

Nevertheless, the movie does have its moments, especially if you're into Hong Kong comedy.  My wife and I laughed out loud several times.  Also, the English subtitles, while sometimes hard to read against a light background, were surprisingly well translated.  Far too often, Hong Kong movie translations are chock full of spelling and grammatical mistakes, but we only noticed a few during this movie.

There's nothing fancy about this DVD.  No special features, no alternate captions or soundtracks; even the DVD itself simply says ""VideoAsia"".  This release is simply a cheap attempt by whoever owns the rights to this movie to capitalize on the success of Shaolin Soccer.  Even so, it was good for some laughs, and fans of Stephen Chow should enjoy it.",1113782400,30,1660,4.795774647887324
8028604,1,B0002KQNZE,"This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called ""Look Out, Officer"" that Stephen Chow made in 1990. Shaolin Idiot is not out yet to my knowledge. If you want Stephen Chow's ""Look Out, Officer"" you should buy this DVD if not, don't.",1111017600,31,274,4.288461538461538
8028605,1,B0002KQNZE,"This movie is the worst ever it has nothing to do with shaolin stuff, it's a story about a cop who got stuck with a ghost and it has bad acting,stupid story and not funny at all, so it's nothing at all like shaolin soccer so you better save your money.",1106438400,12,252,3.9607843137254903
8028606,1,B0002KQNZE,"This movie, while not one of Stephen Chow's best is still on the hilarious side.  There are all the great things you would expect, possession by ghosts, hilarious hijinks....suffice it to say that you'll like it.  Personally it was my least favorite of all his movies but still worth seeing.",1104969600,9,291,4.8
8028607,1,B0002KQNZE,"I bought this DVD for my husband for Xmas.  We loved Shaolin Soccer so much, I thought it would be a great present.  We sat down to watch it on Christmas night and it would not play, in any of our DVD players.  It was only 4.99, so it's not a huge loss, but we were really looking forward to watching it.  Save your 5 bucks!",1103932800,22,324,3.8636363636363638
