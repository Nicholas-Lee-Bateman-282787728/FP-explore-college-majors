2438602,5,B000BRB9ZM,"As of this writing, Amazon has lumped together two foreign releases of this great 2 part film, each of which will present challenges for the majority of US buyers:

The DVD set is region 2 and PAL, which means you must have a set up that can handle those issues.

The French blu-ray is region free, so playing on a US machine should be fine, but it does not have English sub-titles.

Two part film, that was 1st released as two separate features.  Terrific telling of a complex story of intertwined farming families in rural France in the early part of the 20th century.

The acting is mostly of the highest order.  Yves Montand, one of the most suave men in history is completely believable as a rough hewn, self-centered farmer, Gerard Depardieu, also cast against type, as a gentle, educated city born man trying to make it as a farmer also is astounding.  Almost as good is Daniel Auteuil as Montand's not-very-bright son.

Only Emmanuelle Beart, gorgeous though she may be,  doesn't quite convince me as the wild woman of the fields. Some of it is performance, some of it is how perfect she looks.

The story is wonderful in a Dickensian sort of way, with clues and character elements showing up early, only to pay off three hours later.  I love the first part even more, somehow it feels more truly tragic and dense, the 2nd part just a bit too neat by the end.  But still a grand, intelligent, great looking entertainment.",1455494400,,1429,4.56078431372549

The colors of the landscape or overwhelmingly beautiful.  I have watched these movies for years now (had them on VHS and saw them occasionally on television) but I have NEVER seen the French countryside look so amazing and the sound be so vivid.

This is one of the best French films ever (though released in two parts, it is essentially one film), one with wide appeal, and I would recommend it for anyone who can appreciate a film that attempt to find wonder, meaning, wisdom, and amazement in ordinary life, (which might be described as the essence of French films).

2438624,5,B000BRB9ZM,"Not just one of the great French imports of the 1980s but a glistening cinematic accomplishment that possesses a timeless quality, Claude Berris adaptations of Marcel Pagnols JEAN DE FLORETTE and MANON OF THE SPRING have at last arrived in a beautiful Blu-Ray double feature this week from Shout Factory.

The two-part story is set in Provence after WWI and spans 10 years chronicling the pursuit of Cesar Soubeyran (Yves Montand), who conspires to take over a neighboring farm for his pathetic nephew Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), who envisions carnations flowing from its fertile land. The area is particularly lush because of a spring  one that Soubeyran and Ugolin cover up so that the propertys new owner, Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu), won't ever find it.

Instead, Jean, a hard-working hunchback who represents modern city folk to the suspicious locals, struggles to keep things afloat for his wife and his young daughter, hoping for rain that never comes and attempting to create a cistern to provide more water for his ailing crops. All the while, Ugolin tries to put forth the appearance of being helpful while Soubeyran stands on the sidelines, waiting and watching for the opportune moment when he can kindly offer his charity to buy the land out from under him.

Jean De Florette is both gorgeous to look at and thoroughly compelling from start to finish. Its a film thats leisurely told by Berri  who adapted Pagnols novel with Gerard Brach  but is never anything less than enthralling as the story unfolds. The gorgeous French locations are so spectacularly shot by Bruno Nyutten that you can virtually feel the warmth of the land, the scent of its flowers and breezes cascading through the hills right off the screen. Reportedly the most expensive French production ever mounted at the time of its release, Jean De Florette is a memorably rendered work of art for its aesthetic attributes alone.

However, the movies opening part is just a teaser for Manon of the Spring, which was shot along with its predecessor and released six months following Jean De Florettes theatrical run both in France and a year later in the United States. The story so carefully laid out in Jean De Florette comes to a dramatic breaking point in this worthy sequel, one thats even more delicious than its predecessor. Here, Manon (Emmanuelle Beart), the now-grown (and quite fetching), free-spirited daughter of Jean, finally figures out what the Soubeyans did to her father and goes about exacting revenge on both of the men responsible for their provincial passive-aggressiveness.

Its a searing second half that shows how beautifully Berri established the groundwork in the movies opening portion, as seemingly innocuous scenes in Jean De Florette connect with powerhouse dramatic confrontations in Manon of the Spring.

Shouts Blu-Ray double-feature includes each film on its own platter. The 1080p (2.35) transfers are simply outstanding  and represent, arguably, the finest visual presentations Shout has rendered from an MGM licensed property to date. Filled with detail and sumptuous color, this is a breathtaking visual presentation, especially if youve only seen the films previously on non-anamorphic DVD. The subtitles were supposedly improved from MGMs last DVD edition, and both 5.1 and 2.0 DTS MA soundtracks are included along with the original Orion Classics U.S. trailers.

An essential addition to any Blu-Ray library, this double-feature is already my favorite release of the new year. In fact, it might be hard to top it as far as catalog releases go.",1425427200,5,3564,5.127586206896551

2438631,5,B000BRB9ZM,"I have long counted these films among my favorites, but I must admit that I haven't viewed them in years.

I was excited to see them finally released on BluRay at a very attractive price. And I'm even more excited to report that the films come up wonderfully in this HD version. The picture is very clear and free of artifacts. The sound is crystal clear and the dialogue is distinct. I found the subtitles to be well done and generally unobtrusive, but I wonder why no one seems to take the option of placing subtitles in the black area that sits beneath widescreen films when viewed on an HDTV. It's my understanding that the black bars above and below the widescreen picture need to be programmed into the image. If so, why not just place the subtitles there, rather than in the picture itself?

But that's my only complaint about this exceptional reissue. Let's hope this BD release gains more fans of these unique films.

BTW - I could have sworn that the scene where Jean dynamites his dry well in hopes of finding water contained footage of him being struck by a rock made airborne by the explosion. That doesn't appear in this version - we see Jean approaching the well and the scene then cuts to Manon who has been watching at a safe distance. Either I am remembering incorrectly after all these years or a cut has been made in the movie.

French with English subtitles. Ignore the idiotic reviews that report as fact the lie that the films are dubbed into English. What possesses people to write reviews of product they haven't even seen, only to look like fools when the product shows up?

Some movies are as much life experiences as they are films.
Some films resonate on such a timeless, basic human level that dissects men and womens behavior wherever you live, whatever time you live, yet also manages to capture the specificity of a particular time and place.
Shout! Factorys release of Claude Berris 1986 French period drama, Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring are based on the novel by Marcel Pagnol is one of those movies.
In a film that is a visual feast on Blu-ray, with Berri covering its gardens and hills and trees and stone buildings standing alone and apart from other dwellings to the sun-dappled town, almost devoid of color, but unique with its old architecture and sense of decades bordering on a Century, you become a part of that world not long after entering its four hour running time.
I wish there were Extras.  I'm sure they would be fascinating.  But you cannot beat the price for the complete set of these 2 beautifully
crafted movies.

***NOTE ON BLU-RAY QUALITY  - PLUS COMPARISON WITH 2008 FRENCH BLU-RAY RELEASE AND U.S. DVD RELEASE.
***PLEASE BE INFORMED: This release is not dubbed into English or Spanish as Amazon once listed.  English subtitles are of course included.

Based on an older film and novel by Marcel Pagnol, these two films were shot together over a period of 7 months in beautiful Provence locals to catch the changing of the seasons.  At the time, it was the most expensive French film project in history at $17 million dollars.  It was part of the ""French Heritage"" movement pushed by French President Franois Mitterrand and his Minister of Culture which generally showcased period pieces and costume dramas celebrating the culture and landscape of France.  The films are now considered the greatest achievement of that movement.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Shortly after WWI -- Ugolin Soubeyran returns from his war service and informs his uncle Csar Soubeyran that he wishes to grow carnations.  Ugolin is a little simple minded, but he convinces Csar that there is money in the scheme.  Csar knows just the farm to acquire.  It is owned by an old farmer who is not aware of a hidden spring on the property.  The farmer refuses to sell and is killed during an altercation.  This would seem a misfortune, but Csar sees it as an opportunity, thinking the inheritors will want to unload the presumed dry farm at a cheap rate.  Knowing the location of the spring, they seal it up so that it cannot be found even by accident.  Unfortunately for the Soubeyrans, the farm passes to an educated man who is a hunchback, and he also does not wish to sell.  Jean the hunchback arrives with his wife and young girl, highly idealistic and determined to make a success of the property and his grand scheme to raise rabbits and food.  Jean is a bit of a city boy, but has studied his plans to a fantastic degree in theory.  He has also inherited his property through his mother Florette, who was originally from this close knit and biased Provencal community.  The Soubeyrans go about thwarting Jean's plans in secret, while Ugolin pretends to be friends.  They also obscure the fact that Jean's mother comes from their town so that the townspeople themselves will treat them poorly as outsiders.  It is a race against time, elements, and at times the negative actions of others.  All the while, little Manon (Jean's daughter) watches the Sougeyrans with a quiet and distrustful gaze.  ----Skipping to a quick synopsis of second part (again no spoilers)---- Manon is mostly grown and tending to a flock of goats in the same Provencal hills of this little community.  She is spied by Ugolin as she is bathing in a spring and he becomes infatuated with her.  Csar and Ugolin are the last of their prominent family and have no heirs.  Ugolin determines to make Manon his wife.  From the beginning it is clear that various secrets have to be unraveled.  It is a modestly paced tale of tragedy and fate.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  This two part story (generally viewed together), was part of that 1980's ""Heritage Cinema"" movement that revived an ailing French film industry.  The young Emmanuelle Beart is stunning as the grown Manon running wild in the Provencal hills with her tawny blonde mane of hair that is now almost iconic. Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, and Daniel Auteuil were already some of France's greatest actors  Some parts can seem a little melodramatic, but the overall production is a cinematic classic.

BLU-RAY COMPARISON WITH FRENCH RELEASE AND U.S. DVD:  This is the same release from the 2008 French Blu-rays, so this is an old transfer and there is no special remaster beyond what was done in 2008.  It is an improvement over the US DVD release and is listed in 1080P, 2:35:1, DTS HD Master audio for both French and U.S. Blu-ray releases.  It is true that the color scheme is fairly warm compared to the U.S. DVDs.  I noticed this from the opening scene, though I didn't find it that distracting.  You can see it, but it is not that artificial.  In fact, it could be the original desired color pallet (somewhat fall like) of the director.  Not having the research on that, I cannot say that for a fact.  Keep in mind this is an early set for the Blu-ray format (2008 release in France) and the transfer is not unusual at all for an older catalog film (1986 film debut).  It is certainly not reference, but it's still beautiful and the countryside and carnation farms are still gorgeous.  The print is a bit soft.  No heavy grain, just not super crisp either.  There is a fine cinematic grain one would expect.  Given the films' status, you can bet on a special remaster sometime in the future - but you could wait ten years for that.  If you already have the DVDs, it's up to you if it's worth the money to buy again now.  If you already own the French Blu-rays and don't need English subtitles, then you are already set.  I own the 2008 French release also, so this is a direct comparison.

SUBTITLES AND NO DUB:  There was some outcry when Amazon listed this with English dub (then Spanish) and there was worry the original French would not be included.  This was absolutely incorrect information on the Amazon listing.  THERE IS NO ENGLISH DUB.  THERE IS NO SPANISH DUB.  There is only French language and there is only English subtitles.

2438645,4,B000BRB9ZM,"These used to be my favorite French movies on DVD. As a lady mentions at the end of the 2nd movie, this is basically a tragedy. A beautifully played tragedy in a wonderful setting in Southern France. I watched the Blu Rays (2 Blu Rays since each movie is on a separate disc) since they were released this week. The image is definitely sharper than the MGM DVD-s from a few years ago, but fairly uneven. The colors for most part do not look natural - too much yellow and orange so that even the sky in most scenes is white, rather than blue. Green and yellow look fake quite often - maybe the yellow was supposed to make the movie look a little more antique? I compared the colors to my DVD-s from MGM and they look even more unnatural. Lots of pixelation in some of the scenes, some scenes have the contrast overdone (too bright or too dark),but overall better and sharper than the DVD-s. I'm glad I got the Blu Ray discs despite the shortcomings. The subtitles are English, as the audio is French only.

Anytime, quite honestly, I need a good cry I put on the last hour of Manon & just weep uncontrollably especially the pivotal scene between Montand & the old woman which puts the pieces finally together. This is the climax tho not the end. Quelle catastrophe  indeed.
All the major roles are played masterfully & arguably each ones greatest performance. Montand & Autieul are unrecognizable but perfect in their roles. This is Montand's master class in acting. Berart is totally incandescent.  This is also Depardieu at his best. Cinematicaly it is without equal. Sometimes I watch just for the poppies in the opening sequence of Manon.
