2247650,2,B0007WQHE4,"Danielle Steel's book was eons better than the movie. The novel was so incredibly descriptive, and I swooned over Captain Manfred Von Tripp. In the movie, well, I couldn't even get past the first half hour. First of all, the opening scene was incredulous: it looked like Dolff and Kassandra were making love in some '80s art deco building. The novel was set against the backdrop of Germany on the brink of a war. And because I'd read the book, well, I was expecting a mansion - not some modern building with steel frames. Anyway, and then the part where the Nazis attacked them was much too abrupt. The book was so in-depth that it created and nurtured a personal relationship between the reader and the characters, but the movie left my head spinning the way the scenes were so abrupt. I thought that Gerhard was supposed to be the annoying but lovable younger brother, but instead, he was getting his game on with that French girl. And the part where Manfred dies - he was supposed to be dead, yet he gave her a sweet smile and seemed to look Ariana right in the face. I dread to see part two. Maybe one day I'll be able to muster the courage to finish the tiresome movie. Really, it was a far cry from the brilliance conceived in the mind of Ms. Steel. Enjoy the book, read these honest reviews, and save yourself the money and the torture.",1143417600,3,1343,4.419354838709677
2247651,5,B0007WQHE4,"I waited  for 3 years to obtain this DVD.It's a heart-rending story of a wrongly judged genteel German woman whose only""mistake"" was to protect her offspring without meaning to deceive of which she was wrongly accused. A woman who

loved deeply and dearly was finally vindicated when the ending justified her anguish and emotional suffering upon reunion with her long lost sibling and the marriage of her son to a Jewish girl. Although her Jewish husband and his family prejudged her  harshly, she was an innocent victim of the realities of a cruel

war. Kudos to the author for the magnificent treatment of an extremely sensitive subject.",1127692800,8,639,4.94392523364486
2247652,4,B0007WQHE4,"One of the better Danielle Steel telemovies, THE RING is the romantic and tragic story of Ariana von Gotthard, a young German woman in WWII who is separated from her brother and father while they are trying to escape to Switzerland.  Interned as a traitor, Ariana is subjected to cruel horrors, when she meets and falls in love with sympathetic German soldier Manfred.  Just as the city of Berlin falls to the Allies, they get married and he is later killed.  Ariana leaves for America under a Jewish alias and begins a new life, never giving up hope of finding her beloved brother.

Natassja Kinski is perfect in the role of Ariana.  I can't imagine another actress delivering a better performance.  Excellent recreation of the period with great photography.  The cast also includes Rupert Penry-Jones, Linda Lavin, Leslie Caron, Jean Marsh, John Tenney, Leigh Lawson, Tim DeKay and Michael York.",1124928000,23,897,4.94

2247676,5,B0007WQHE4,"First of all, I want to start off this review, by saying that I am a HUGE & AVID Danielle Steel fan!

I have read (and LOVED) NUMEROUS Danielle Steel books, not only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/0440173922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>&nbsp;(the book that this movie is based on), but ALSO&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jewels/dp/044021422X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jewels</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoya/dp/0440203856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoya</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remembrance/dp/0440173701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remembrance</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossings/dp/044011585X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossings</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Echoes/dp/B0085SD1B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Echoes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Good-Woman-A-Novel/dp/0440243300/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Good Woman: A Novel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Safe-Harbour/dp/B000A1EIP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Safe Harbour</a>, ""H.R.H."", ""Miracle"", and countless others (too many to name or even remember the titles of, off the top of my head -- though the ones I've listed above are my TOP faves!)

**SPOILERS AHEAD!!**

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danielle-Steel-s-The-Ring-Parts-1-2/dp/B0007WQHE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danielle Steel's The Ring: Parts 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;is the story of Ariana (Nastassja Kinski) & Gerhard (Rupert Penry-Jones) von Gotthard, a sister and brother who come from wealthy German aristocracy, and whose prominent Berlin family is systematically destroyed when the Nazis come to power.

Beginning with the suicide of Ariana & Gerhard's mother, Kassandra (Paula Hamilton) in the early years of the Nazi era, and the death of their father, Walmar (Michael York) after being shot by the Germans during the final months of World War II, the von Gotthard family is torn apart, one by one.

Walmar von Gotthard was killed by the Nazis at the German-Swiss border, after helping his 16-year-old son Gerhard escape to Zurich, Switzerland, in order to avoid the Nazi military draft -- a fateful decision that results in a decades-long separation between Ariana & Gerhard.

Danielle Steel's ""The Ring"" follows Ariana & Gerhard over the span of around 40 years (from the mid 1930s to the 1970s) -- from their childhood in early Nazi Germany, their adolescence (and separation from each other) & young adulthoods in World War II Europe, to their fruitless search for each other in the months & years after the war, and then ultimately, their separate lives on different continents (Ariana in New York City and Gerhard in Paris) , as well as their eventual reunion around 3 decades after their separation --  brought about by the next generation (Ariana's son, Noel).

Although I have read & LOVED Danielle Steel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/0440173922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>, there are some parts (or passages) where I like the book version better than the movie, but in other ways I like the movie version a lot better.

For example, I thought the book did a much better job than the movie at fleshing out Kassandra's character, including her relationship (or lack thereof!) with her much-older husband Walmar and her children, Ariana & Gerhard and the loneliness, desperation & feelings of being ""trapped in a gilded cage"", leading to her illicit romance with Dolff Stern and the tragedy that resulted from that affair.

On the other hand, I did not like the way that the book portrayed the storyline involving Max Thomas's relationship with the family, and his escape from Germany to Switzerland and thought the movie did a much better job with that storyline, as well as the storyline about what happened to Gerhard after he was separated from his father and sister (which the book neglected, instead focusing solely on Ariana's storyline).

I also did not like how in the book, Ariana never went back to Germany after the war to search for her father or brother (unlike the movie where Ariana, Max & Noel returned to Germany in 1946 to look for them). I thought that it was unrealistic that she would just completely give up all hope without even TRYING to search for them once things had settled down in Europe. And in a similar vein, I did NOT like it how in the book, Ariana & Gerhard never conclusively learn what happened to Walmar (although of course, the reader does!). Even though it was more unrealistic, I preferred the movie version, in which during Ariana's visit to Berlin after the war, Max helped her to locate Walmar's body (which was buried near the Swiss border) and have it buried in the Von Gotthard family plot at the Grunewald cemetery -- and that Gerhard & Giselle were able to see Walmar's tombstone there, during their visit to Berlin so that at least both Ariana & Gerhard could have ""closure"" in regards to their father. In those respects, I love the movie better than the book.

But in other ways, I love the book better than the movie. Basically there were too many deviations between the book and the movie -- while some changes were for the better, other changes were NOT!

Just as it was written in the book version, I would have liked to see more of Kassandra's story, more depth in Manfred and Ariana's love story and more about the evolution of Ariana's relationship with the Liebman family & eventually Paul Liebman (as in the way it transpired in the book) as well as Noel & Tamara's romance, and Tamara's friendship with Brigitte Gerard (instead of just randomly meeting Brigitte the way it was shown in the movie)

Yet, I also liked how the ending was written for the movie and think that it should have ended with aspects of BOTH the book & movie versions (by combining Tamara's friendship with Brigitte as in the book, as well as Noel & Tamara meeting Brigitte at her family's art gallery while on their honeymoon, as in the movie)

So I guess it just boils down to that I LOVE BOTH the book and the movie, in different ways!",1359676800,,6400,5.971615720524017

8053067,4,B0007WQHE4,"I recently finished watching all 25 Steel TV movies and for me ""The Ring"" is almost as good as ""Crossings"" (Cheryl Ladd, Lee Horsley and Christopher Plummer), but there are a few others which I thoroughly enjoyed watching as well like ""Full Circle"", ""Fine Things"", ""Kaleidoscope"" (Jaclyn Smith), ""No Greater Love"" (about Titanic survivors), ""A Perfect Stranger"" (Robert Urich), ""Once in a Lifetime"" (Barry Bostwick & Lindsay Wagner), ""Jewels"" (the first part is great, the 2nd part is mediocre) and of course ""Palomino"" (with Lee Horsley).
Didn't care for ""Now and Forever"" (Cheryl Ladd) and ""Mixed Blessings"" (Bruce Greenwood).

Everybody who enjoys WW II stories, will be satisfied with this film which stars Nastassja Kinski, Leslie Caron and Michael York.

Attention!!! SPOILERS!!!

I also read the novel after having watched the movie first which I tend to do (then at least I'm not having different images of the characters in my imagination).
What makes the TV movie IMHO better than the novel is the fact that in the novel Ariana's brother only is participating in the beginning and towards the end. However, in the two parts TV movie his life is described parallel to Ariana's over the years.

In the movie Ariana meets Paul in Europe whereas in the book she meets him when he returns injured from WW II.
The good thing about the novel is the caring and loving relationship between Ariana and Paul's parents which is described very touchingly by the author. Other than that the TV movie follows the novel pretty closely.

I rate ""Crossings"" with 5 stars and ""The Ring"" with 4 stars.",1391126400,,1591,4.9216417910447765
