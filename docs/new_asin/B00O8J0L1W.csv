6729240,5,B00O8J0L1W,"OMG OMG OMG OMG!! I FINALLY own the entire Mortal Kombat Conquest series!! Great quality =) Not super high tech but crystal clear and not fuzzy or distorted.

Like many, I've waited YEARS to own this series! I've wanted it since the day the first episode aired! However, especially living in Canada, there was no way to own the entire series. Only some of the episodes from the series itself were available on DVD and available in limited quantities in the U.S (if you were lucky enough to find and own one, that is). Even then it was near impossible to own the entire series simply because it wasn't available (I remember years ago it was mentioned the only way to obtain all 22 episodes was in Australia, of all places, apparently). And for years it wasn't available, even on Amazon, and Ebay was a risky dice throw. YouTube was the only sanction for watching the episodes which were all split into 3 parts due to the size of the files. Recently, I was disheartened to learn that for whatever reason, none of the accounts that had the entire series uploaded were available anymore on YouTube =\ So out of a whim I decided to try here one final time, although like many times before, assuming that it would never, ever be available here or anywhere that would have all 22 episodes available for purchase (although I had always hoped). I searched 4 days ago and BAM! Here it was!! Finally!! THANK YOU!! From one happy MK fan to another =)

If you loved this series as a kid, GET IT! You WILL NOT be disappointed! It's just as you remembered and more! Even in the 90's cheesy but fitting sound effects =D If you've waited as long as I and many others have for this series to come out all in one DVD formatted pack, then I highly suggest that you do not let this opportunity slip through your fingers! It's taken this long for all 22 episodes to be available for purchase at once, why wait more? I'm a HUGE MK fan and wouldn't pass this up for the world! The inner child in me came out when I discovered this online and when I got it today =D I'm one happy Canadian MK camper! Seriously, I had to muffle my scream/squeal out of pure happiness and excitement. No, really, true story.",1452124800,,2180,4.393564356435643
6729241,3,B00O8J0L1W,"BOTTOM LINE: Regardless of whether you're a hardcore Kombat fanatic or just mildly curious about the show, I strongly recommend buying this set used. The cash you save will help offset the bad taste the pixely look of the episodes will leave. Though the episodes don't look as good as they could (and should), I'm still glad this obscure series got a legit home release.  4 STARS for the show itself, minus 1 STAR for the disappointing video issues.

THE STORY: Paolo Montalban plays Kung Lao, ancient ancestor of popular Mortal Kombat fighter Liu Kang. Lao is the central character of this one-season series, which details his efforts to gather & train the next generation of warriors for future Mortal Kombat tournaments. While doing so, he must also keep tabs on (and frequently battle) the vicious minions of Outworld, with cryptic guidance and occasional assistance in the form of Rayden, MK's resident God of Thunder, played by Jeffrey Meek. To this end, Kung Lao teams up with a disgraced exiled guard named Siro (Daniel Bernhardt) and a feisty thief, Taja (Kristanna ""T3"" Loken). Together the three friends run a local trading post and are routinely dragged into various martial arts-heavy rough & tumble adventures.

THOUGHTS: A 22 episode show which aired in 1998-99 as part of Universal's aborted ""Action Pack"" syndicated series, MK: CONQUEST is a lot of silly, campy fun. You will quickly get a feel for how low budget the series is after just a few episodes but that's part of its charm, yet also a serious hampering to its long term success. Every city scene is the same 10-15 people milling about and the marketplace is a constrictive, under-lit and obviously fake studio set. On the plus side, the three young actors seem to be having fun and have an excellent chemistry together, a strong selling point for owning this show on DVD. Jeffrey Meek, likewise, makes for an excellent, devil-may-care Rayden, (a far better fit for the character than James Remar, who played MK's God of Thunder in the second feature film, MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION). Meeks pulls double-duty acting chores here, also playing the dastardly Shao Khan, ruthless mastermind & villainous overlord of Outworld, who stealthily manipulates others and routinely sends them forth to destroy Kung Lao & his friends.

The show's fight scenes have a high energy level and are well-choreographed for the most part, if somewhat repetitive. But hey, there are only so many ways you can film someone getting kicked in the face before it starts to look monotonous. LOL. A strong selling point for babe-crazy viewers is that MK:C features plenty of scantily-clad females in thin, skintight outfits, (most without the annoyance of obstructive undergarments), leaving very little to the imagination. Delightfully, many of these eye candy dolls are every bit as lethal as the muscle-bound hunks once the fighting starts; the girls always giving as good as they get. Plus the guys & gals routinely mix it up with no one pulling their punches, so to speak. But this the kind of show where everyone gets the crap kicked & punched out of them repeatedly, yet their hair remains unmussed and they are miraculously bruise & scar free the very next day/scene. (So don't say you weren't warned.) :-)~ Perhaps the biggest strike against CONQUEST is that there was no proper conclusion to the series, as it was obviously intended to last longer than a single season. Still, this hard-kicking, fast-punching show, while lightweight & silly, remains a pretty good balm for your martial arts fighting fix.

THE DVD SET: The bad news is that while MORTAL KOMBAT: CONQUEST arrives as a complete 4-disc boxset, the episodes themselves don't look so hot, thanks to an overall low bitrate & lots of video compression. Pixelation is abundant. This really hurts the look of things, since so much of the show is filmed either on dimly-lit studio sets or on location in the dark of night. Things could have looked a lot better if they would have spread out the number of episodes over five or six DVD's instead of cramming everything together on four discs. A bad decision but one we're forced to live with it, so be prepared. Zero extras are included with the set, which is another strike against it. On the good side, the audio is level & strong, with a mostly clean, thumping techno track.",1451347200,7,4343,4.887381275440977

6729244,4,B00O8J0L1W,"ALL the cheesy fun you'd expect from a 90s adventure show.  Right up there with Hercules and Xena. But with top-notch martial arts choreography!
If you enjoyed ANY of the Mortal Kombat video games,  and especially if you enjoyed the first movie - you should find something to LOVE about this show.

The ONLY reasons I give it 4 out of 5 stars instead of the full 5 ...
1) the 90s cheese is definitely dated and might put some people off
2) the show ends on a bit of a cliffhanger and was unfortunately never continued.
3) the changes to the mythologies,  while interesting and entertaining, were unnecessary.
4) this DVD release is bare-bones with no features whatsoever.",1443571200,,671,4.61344537815126

It was nice to finally get it released domestically.  The video and audio transfers are totally fine and stand up fairly well with the passage of time.  My biggest complaint?  The disc menus.  They look like they were done with a generic, widely available personal DVD burning program that a team of monkeys could operate, except the monkeys would probably be able to come up with something creative.  But the show itself is still a good trip down memory lane.",1442620800,,680,4.4

6729249,4,B00O8J0L1W,"Mortal Kombat Conquest followed a plot similar to the first live action movie: three strangers fighting against the supernatural forces of Outworld. The series was low-budget, so it didn't have the best special effects, but it had some awesome fight scenes and some good character story arcs. Many video game characters make an appearance in the series, such as Quan Chi, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Rain, Noob Saibot, Mileena, Kitana, and others. A lot of people may say it doesn't follow the game closely enough, or that every character's origin isn't the same as in the game. But this series puts its own spin on the character's and their origins, and resembles the game enough to still be called ""Mortal Kombat."" And it was much better than the second movie.

No, the series didn't have the most complex stories, but it wasn't meant to. It was meant to be a fun, simple martial arts action series with cool fight scenes and some hot women (all scantily clad). Bottom line, if you remembered and enjoyed the first movie, I believe you'll enjoy this series too. It was actually meant to be prequel to the first movie, but sadly, because of budget constraints the series didn't last a second season, which would have finished the story and made it the prequel it was supposed to be. So I look at it as a standalone series from the movies.

Purchase Mortal Kombat Conquest, grab some popcorn, and have fun.",1439337600,,1398,4.725409836065574

6729251,4,B00O8J0L1W,"I liked the show it was good campy fun. I loved seeing origin stories and a lot of great Mortal Kombat characters in this series. You get to see Kung Lao, Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, Shao Kahn, Rayden, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, Rain, Noob Saibot, Reiko, Kitana and Mileena. Some characters are handled better than others. Some play an important part and others are introduced and forgotten about. I felt like Kitana could have been a bigger part of the story. Reiko doesn't do much but report to Shao Khan. Shang Tsung is probably the most fully realized villain in this series. Another villain they really developed and had a big role and showed some background and how he came to be was Sub-Zero. My complaint is that toward the end the last several episodes focus too much on characters that have nothing to do with Mortal Kombat games and were made just for this show. While I enjoyed Kreeya and Vorpax played by Fabiana Udenio and Tracy Douglas I thought it took away the focus from other characters who are actually important to the Mortal Kombat mythology and could have had a bigger role. I guess they thought they needed to create another set of characters that could antagonize Shao Kahn since he couldn't really attack Kung Lao without breaking the rules of Mortal Kombat. Similarly Shang Tsung has to force Kung Lao to attack him first or has to send others to kill Kung Lao since he also really isn't supposed to attack Kung Lao until the next tournament. That is why I believe some of these issues would have been resolved if instead they focused on the tournament and instead this series begins after the end of the last tournament and Kung Lao is trying to find and train new fighters for the next tournament. Also spoiler alert but every time he finds a new fighter it never works out. I have two episodes left but I feel like Shang Tsung and Vorpax had better character arcs then the heroes. Still I liked the action the music and also glad the characters use their powers in the show.",1437955200,,2001,4.561111111111111

6729259,5,B00O8J0L1W,"I won't go into grave detail here.
This was a milk product in the hay day of mortal kombat.

Any video game to film adaptation never lives up to what it should be and this is no exception.
Bad acting, bad scripts, bad everything.
Character introductions of never developed in game characters etc.

It simply sold because it had mortal kombat in the name.

But as a kid I was so in love with anything and everything mortal kombat.

This is more like buying a B rated horror film and expecting it to be so bad it's good.

Don't buy this expecting anything outside of reliving your childhood and seeing something tangible towards that.

6729268,5,B00O8J0L1W,"I enjoy this TV Show. I use to watch it every Saturdays at 5pm on KCAL 9 local channel. Back in 1998-1999. I'm glad Mortal Kombat finally came out on dvd. The shipping was quick. The 4 dvds are dual layered. 6 episodes approximately 40-45min long without commercials. The picture quality is clear. Much recommended for a 480i Tube crt color tv 4:3 standard frame. Upconverting it on an HDTV using PS3/PS4 looks decent but not HD. That's why I always use my 1986 20"" Sharp CRT tv for dvds. I use my Samsung 40"" LED HDTV 1080p 120fps to enjoy blu ray.

The show Mortal Kombat Conquest itself brings some memories. Actress Kristanna Loken as thief Tasha was about 19-20yrs old then. With the dark brown/orange short hair. She very pretty. I notice I can see a quick look of Paolo Montalban's stunt double. Who plays Kung Lao. I guess only Daniel Bernthart as Siro and Jeff Meek as Raiden/Shao Kahn knows martial arts. You get to see other celebrities and other martial artist. Along with former WCW wrestler Wrath. This show is way better than the last two Mortal Kombat films in the mid late 90's.

6729273,5,B00O8J0L1W,"Huge fan of the series and really was waiting for this for a long time.  I really wish they came out with a season 2 or a sequel that told us what happen to the earth realm.  There was so much left to tell and some interesting stuff like Kreeya, Shang Tsungs Life before he met Shao Kahn.  Would of love to see more Smoke and Sub-Zero stuff.  The best episodes IMO were Immortal, serpent and ice, The Master, really had some good story telling and action in those.

For anyone wondering which MK conquest dvd set u should buy cause I know some guys are aware there were other dvd sets(yes and they were legit and from Warner Bros) read my comments below.

I own the Australian dvd set too and I can tell u your not missing much.  Both sets don't have extras or any deleted scenes.  Both are english audio and english subs only.  the only big differences is the Australian dvds are 6 and the us dvds are 4.  I haven't watched all the episodes or did a detailed comparison of the us and Australian dvd set yet, but i saw the first 2 eps of warrior eternal and the scorpion versus sub zero match (serpent and the ice) on both the US and Australian dvds.  The video and sound quality seem the same to me and I was using the same blurry player and tv to watch.  I know there was also the UK dvds too but only the us and Australian have come out with official dvd complete sets.  Other than the dvd count is  small differences like the australian packaging is better than the us release.  As you can see the australian set has artwork on both the front and back cover of the dvd and the case is see-through case.  Overall if u want the series and u don't care about fancy dvd artwork, packaging, and want to save money the US dads are fine.  Like I said before I only watched the first few episodes and the serpent and Ice episode to compare and the quality turned out the same or maybe a little better in the australian dads since they  used 6 dads instead of 4 dvds.  The  video/sound quality of the us and australian dads could be the same or the australian better since they used 6 dvds, yet encoding settings, source of the material used for the us or australian release does make a difference.

If u have the cash, care about packaging,  artwork, and a region free dvd player or a region 4 dvd player the Mortal combat conquest australian dvds is not a bad option to consider.  Again No big difference in terms of Video/sound quality, and extras between the US/Australian sets, but if u care about fancy artwork, packaging and have a australian or region 4 dvd player consider that version before the US dvd set.  If u don't care about the fancy artwork, see-through case, and the 4 dvds instead of 6 dvds doesn't bother u much go with the us version.  No need to change region or buy a region 4 dvd player and you don't have to go to ebay, pay import taxes, nor  wait for costume.  USA buyers easily buy the us dvd sets on amazon and get it much faster in your dvd player and save u the time and work to get the australian dvd set.",1427328000,,3032,4.209705372616984

6729275,4,B00O8J0L1W,"4-5 STAR FAN FAVORITE FOR CAMPY MARTIAL ARTS ADVENTURE

MAYBE 3 STARS FOR SLIM PRODUCTION RESOURCES

Aired 1998-1999 in 22 episodes. For completists of the Mortal Kombat franchise, naturally this single season TV series is significant. For those not familiar with the series, you should be aware it has aged and was designed as a very campy martial arts adventure series. The budget was unfortunately thin, and ultimately a contributor to the cancelation after just one season despite the show's popularity among some audiences.  This release marks the first time the complete series has been released on region 1 DVD for US audiences. (more on previous releases below)

THE STORY (no spoilers): The show is set many centuries before the film franchise. Every generation, champions from across the realms of the universe gather to defend their worlds in Mortal Kombat. The losers will have their realms absorbed into Outworld by it's Emperor Shao Khan. Kung Lao is the champion of Earth Realm, guided by the Earth Realm protector named Lord Rayden. Shang Tsung (the champion of Outworld) and Kung Lao face off in the final match, but Kung Lao shows merci to the Outworld champion rather than taking his life. As punishment for his loss, Shang Tsung is banished to the cobalt mines, a fate actually worse than death. However, Shang Tsung is powerful and will seek his revenge on both Kung Lao and Emperor Shao Khan. This is all just set up for the series itself. Kung Lao returns home and seeks to marry his sweetheart, the ridiculously beautiful Geneviere, though her father is against it. Ultimately though, the story progresses as a quest to prepare for a future tournament while forces of Shang Tsung seek to destroy Kung Lao. The young warrior is joined by two sidekicks, an exiled guard Siro from Geneviere's house, and a thief named Taja played by Kristanna Loken. There is turmoil in both Earth Realm and in Outworld itself as powerful sorcerers vie to take the throne. The genesis and mythology of several fighters is explored in this series such as Sub-Zero, Kitana, and Scorpion.

OTHER THOUGHTS: One might be surprised at the number of recognizable actors making early career appearances.  I wouldn't say it launched any of their careers as they did have earlier works, but there are notable stars like Kristanna Loken, Eva Mendes, Jamie Presley, and Fabiana Udenio. For fans of the films who haven't seen this series yet, the music is not as strong, the acting can be very cheesy, the CGI is not so great, and the plot is pretty thin. In the end it's all about campy martial arts fun. Viewers who don't have a specific affection for the Mortal Kombat franchise may find this series less compelling. But fans of individual stars may still find it interesting.

PREVIOUS RELEASES: Just a brief and non-comprehensive mention of previous releases. This received partial releases in the UK in the form of the first 4 episodes in a one DVD set, and a second release called The Final Battle which was the final 2 episodes edited to run like a movie. My understanding is that only Australia got the complete series release before this new region 1 set. Many fans held on to those partial series discs from the UK for years though they only play on region 2 players.  I highly recommend it as long as you know what to expect.",1424304000,23,3328,4.795811518324608

8682550,5,B00O8J0L1W,"This is one of my favorite TV shows ever. Mortal Kombat Conquest is a great telling of the original Kung Lao's back story. The action is beautifully choreographed, the character costumes are awesome, and the acting quality is great. It really is sad that this show didn't get more than just the one season. It's much better than other - more popular - shows of the time, such as The Adventures of Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess.

If you miss the days where non-HBO/Showtime TV shows actually had storylines and a solid reason to watch them, Mortal Kombat Conquest is definitely a must have for your collection. I'd recommend this show for anyone that's a fan of the old action TV shows.",1524182400,,690,4.655737704918033

And they didn't have it on Blu-Ray. Better sound. Better picture. If Blu-Ray didn't have it so I bought it on dvd. Best memories of Mortal Kombat Conquest. They should've made second season, I thought it was awesome.",1522022400,,394,4.266666666666667

8682558,5,B00O8J0L1W,I love this series I remember getting some of these taped off TV. It brings back so many memories seining  Kung Lao Taja and Siro defend Earthrealm against Shao Kahn and his henchmen from Outworld with the help of the Thunder God Raiden brilliantly played by Jeff Meek. The fighting in this is way better then in the movies even Paolo Montalaban who plays Kung Lao can portray some awesome moves. I already have the original Australian set but if I  didn't I would so buy this Mortal Kombat conquest is a must watch for any fan of MK there's not one episode that's bad and the actors who potray the characters are just outstanding. So if your a fan of Mortal Kombat or looking for a old school action packed TV show buy this it's action packed from beginning to end.,1474502400,,766,4.387323943661972
