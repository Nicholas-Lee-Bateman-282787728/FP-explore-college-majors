Despite recieving thousands of very serious complaints about health problems and bad reactions to Aspartame, the FDA refuses to act in the best interest of consumers.  Sweet Remedy provides a compelling documentary of the corruption that accompanied this product to it's FDA approval, and a first hand look at the damage it has wreaked on people's health.

As a person who has suffered greatly from the effects of Aspartame poisoning (methanol poisoning), I can relate first hand to the other victims of this toxic sweetener and the disbelief that those beloved 'diet cokes' could be the cause of the maladies (especially by the medical community).  You must educate yourself on this and other toxins.  I lost many prime years suffering from headaches, memory loss, chronic fatigue, dizziness, and my thinking became so clouded I had to use a calculator to add simple numbers like I was back in first grade again. Thank god for the internet and the ability to find information!  That is how I discovered the connection to my health problems and drinking diet cokes (the doctors would have NEVER offered that as a solution).
As a consumer - be aware, be very aware.....",1199750400,68,1231,4.9227053140096615
2736648,3,B000MLJ12A,"Sweet Remedy is an informative, rather than an entertaining documentary.  It drives home the argument that Aspartame, a chemical food sweetner, is linked to a large number of medical disorders, some at the very serious end of the scale, such as  MS and brain tumours. The presentation is polemical in character: it doesn't attempt to provide all sides of the argument, but aggressively attacks the safety of this product. Sceptics will no doubt argue that the the evidence presented is, at best, anecdotal and not powerfully persuasive. But the doco does serve an important public purpose by giving voice to the concerns of those who have suffered serious illnesses and, after eliminating Aspartame from their diet, completely recovered, even in circumstances where conventional medicine could not provide the cure.  This is a relatively low budget production with an important, potentially life saving message.",1192320000,48,911,5.356643356643357

8169742,5,B000MLJ12A,"I am 71 and grew up believing we could trust the people making and selling the food and medicine we buy. If that was ever true, it clearly is no longer so. Each one of us has to take responsibility to educate ourselves about what we are putting into our bodies. I am grateful to Dr. Blaylock, Dr. Mercola and the others in this film who have done the the work and spoken up for all of us.

8169746,5,B000MLJ12A,"I personally found this film to be a little gem, and I am so glad to have seen it.  It delves into much more than just Aspartame toxicity, but also MSG and GMOs too.  A great deal of evidence is presented from clinical practitioners, nutritionists, recovered patients and activists seeking industry improvements.  Western and Traditional Chinese therapies are discussed as well.  No fluff.  All wonderful information concisely conveyed in this very engaging film.",1310601600,15,463,5.287671232876712
