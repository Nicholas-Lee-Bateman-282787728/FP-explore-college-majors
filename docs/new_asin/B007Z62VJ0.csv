5115009,4,B007Z62VJ0,I've studied many techniques for self improvement and thought this approach was very practical and straightforward.  I think this is one of the better approaches out there and it reinforces what was learned elsewhere.  Stick with it and you will get results!,1347321600,,258,5.119047619047619
5115010,5,B007Z62VJ0,"I was pleasantly surprised because I thought this film was going to be about some method for exchanging positive thoughts for negative thoughts.  It goes beyond that idea to the realm of infinite ideas and possibilities.  I also felt the film did a great job in explaining why the Thought Exchange method is an effective alternative or supplement to self-help concepts like ""affirmations"" and ""your life is a mirror"".  It did a wonderful job of explaining the idea that everything is already here - we just need to discover it. This is a really valuable method to have in a self-improvement toolkit.  I am now going to buy the book.",1347321600,,632,4.718181818181818
5115011,3,B007Z62VJ0,The initial information was very worth the time of listening. The details and the short reviews were excellent. I had a good sense of what I would be getting. I purchased the video for a group of freshman college students. My purpose was to give them some insights for critical thinking. The video was very insightful and some of the reviews the students gave me were very complimentary of the focus of the video. I was very satisfied.,1347148800,12,435,4.589743589743589
5115012,5,B007Z62VJ0,"i am in the midst of trying to change patterns that were handed down to me from family beliefs, and having been supremely disappointed by the
unwatchability of some LoA documentaries, i thought i would give this a try! i found the film to be well done and the images pleasing and not cheesy like some
films. the methods seem very doable and i am excited to try to keep a journal
and experiment with these techniques. give this film a try- its less than an expensive coffee drink  and could change your life!",1342915200,3,507,4.3936170212765955
5115013,4,B007Z62VJ0,"I picked up this movie because the back sounded interesting and boy I was in for a treat.
This is an intelligent movie about perspective, why most people are continue to think negatively through their lives, and how one can change their perspective. It is a very good concept and leaves you thinking of how to improve your life. This is an important movie that can really make a difference. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to improve their life or even if you just have an interest in how the mind works.",1341705600,,520,4.427083333333333
5115014,1,B007Z62VJ0,...but I found this film disappointing. The interviewees are not good at expressing how the concepts have changed their lives. The author spends too much time looking dead into the camera espousing high brow concepts. Also the film quality runs the gamut from highly professional to tinny and poorly recorded. I'll have to read the book. This DVD was uninspiring and lacking in practical information. What a shame - I had such high hopes.,1341619200,7,438,4.9324324324324325
5115015,1,B007Z62VJ0,"Sigh, the trailer was enticing. Yes many people have read ALL the books about how thoughts create reality. Many people still struggle with changing their thinking. This movie unfortunately does not have the answer.  While there are a few good tidbits, like their point that if you think the right thoughts, some external source will deliver what you want is a misguided idea. However, the solution being offered by the movie, which is that paying attention to our sensations is the missing link that will reset everything and open up unlimited possibility is also misguided, an absurd oversimplification, confusing, and inaccurate. First, the explanation of sensations they offer simply does not make sense. The movie claims there is no difference in our body between an orgasm and a panic attack and that it is just the contextual interpretation that we make of the situation. Anyone who has ever experienced these two things would know they feel nothing alike. What the movie is claiming adds up to the James-Lange Theory of Emotions which was tossed out by people who do research on this subject long ago. The Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotions says we interpret our environment though a thought process which generates an emotion that is represented partly through physiological responses. Which the movie also claims is true. In other words, they can't get their story straight.  Most of what they are trying to explain is basic cognitive therapy but instead of using psychological language they make up their own terms.

The real answer to why we don't change our thinking is that 1) it is hard and requires conscious awareness at all times 2) most people don't want change badly enough to put forth the effort 3) Many people think this stuff sounds great but they don't really believe it will work ie, they have low expectation about the return on their efforts 4) It is much easier to just do the same old thing.  Many people say they want something but do nothing to make it happen. Why? Because they don't really expect it. Just like many people want to win the lottery but few buy tickets. Expectation is about what we really believe to be true or possible. Unlike what the movie says, you can in fact believe things in varying degrees. You can believe something a little or a lot. The action that we are willing to take on any subject is in direct proportion to what we believe to be true. If you are looking for real answers do not wast your money on this movie. Read a few good books on cognitive behavioral therapy.",1341532800,24,2526,4.747152619589977
5115016,1,B007Z62VJ0,"This the first customer review I have ever written, but after viewing this film I felt compelled - no, obligated - to warn anyone else away from wasting their time and money in order be told that the only way to be happy in this world is through money, success, and love... The film stays true to this idea all the way through, and basically states that thinking in the correct way (or asking God) will garner you gifts along these three dimensions.  The film is very weak and based upon personal experience of one man, with no real evidence either for or against the 'revealed' process, and the purpose seems to be to generate revenue from this poorly made documentary, with no real substance provided to the consumer.",1341100800,9,719,4.573643410852713
5115017,5,B007Z62VJ0,"I saw this in the list of recommendations earlier in the day and it kept popping up in my head. Noticing that, I decided to watch it and I'm glad I did.

Like many people, I saw The Secret years ago, and I'm familiar with many self help topics probably like you are. What caught my attention in the description was the mention of why people have a hard time manifesting the things they desire. I'm guessing that's the big problem for most people.

I think you'll be familiar with many points made in this film. One word that was not mentioned but is implied is perspective. Friedman's solution to the manifesting problem has merit, in my opinion, and I agree with what he advocates.

As he explains, people get stuck in one phase of the manifesting process. I heartily recommend you watch this, and pay attention to the shift in perspective which is an important part for success.

Friedman also illustrates how people (understandably) look at things incorrectly. We have developed an approach that is basically 180 degrees out of phase from what's really going on. He explains how this happens, the effect it produces, and how to correct it.

As I watched this film, I was thinking about my own life and how I've been stuck in certain areas. I was able to see my own solutions very clearly and it was exciting.

It's important to know that some important points are left out, and maybe Friedman felt it understood or just didn't take time to discuss them.

You may (will) struggle if you're coming from negativity. Or, if you tend to be pessimistic or negative, then you'll need to apply his method to those issues and clean them out.

Many of our thinking habits are so much a part of us that we don't notice them so easily. Because of that, you may get stuck just trying to understand or give your self enough of a chance to seriously think through what he's offering. So that's an area where you need to be careful.

Friedman has an intelligent and common sense approach for breaking through the blocks so many people have with manifesting positive change. There is hope for you if you think there is and believe it. If you think there's always hope, then watch this and you won't be disappointed.",1339891200,47,2201,4.5518987341772155

5115022,5,B007Z62VJ0,"David FRiedman is the fines teacher I know for showing the way inside and getting clean about the diferences of what we have been calling 'feeling"" and what are actually physical sensations based on the thoughts we are holding.  This DVD is delightful, but I really recommend the book.  I have it in all three versions:  the paperback, the audiobook, and on my Kindle.",1408147200,,368,4.71875
5115023,4,B007Z62VJ0,"Once upon a time, I woke up in chronic pain that spanned several years and was accompanied by panic attacks.  After spending a great deal of money and time on various types of physical, emotional, and even--yes--metaphysical therapies, I watched ""The Thought Exchange"" one night in 2012 and, after applying some of the very simple concepts, found myself able to experience intense sensations associated with anxiety without falling over the edge into panic.  And for what, like $2?

Also,  Friedman's interpretation and explanation of ""law of attraction"" stuff seemed very grounded and reasonable; that realm could benefit from more sober thinking like his.",1403654400,4,657,5.349514563106796

5115025,4,B007Z62VJ0,Very simple language and relatable examples. This is a user friendly guide to the Law of Attraction in many ways.

5115029,5,B007Z62VJ0,"The concept that what shows up in my life is really a mirror of my internal thoughts and beliefs is made very clear in this movie.  The idea of moving past negative thoughts and beliefs by feeling my emotions within my body (called sensations in the movie) with full awareness and acceptance was not something that I practiced before watching this.  I had previously used a more time consuming method of clearing false beliefs and this method put out by David Friedman seems to work more efficiently, easily and thoroughly.  Fundamentally, I think this is one of the best self-help movies available.",1390953600,,599,4.852941176470588
5115030,2,B007Z62VJ0,"Nothing new here. It's certainly interesting, but the point David is trying to make in the documentary could have been made in 15 minutes.

5115034,5,B007Z62VJ0,"I was asking for an answer on a question that stumped me over and over again then one day I wanted to watch a ""feel good"" movie on Amazon and here was the film The Thought Exchange in which I was curious so I watched it and was hooked on it because the film was created so perfectly well from beginning to end.  That day was my complete awakening and a fulfillment to all that I have been asking for. I understood what the author and host/speaker was talking and explaining about since I have self educated myself with all other methods prior to watching this film and also I have a deep sense of knowing of what is true and real in my life prior to all the methods I have learned and still learning and apply it.  This is the perfect film that ties everything which I know now I am complete and will no longer require any other film for confirmation and answers.  To the author/speaker/host  - Thank you so much for putting yourself and your life in public to assist us all by your examples from your own personal experiences which I know will greatly help us all to understand more clearly and comfortably.",1383955200,9,1108,4.3125
5115035,4,B007Z62VJ0,I found Friedman's suggestions practical and entertaining. I especially liked his advice of attending to our sensations and thinking of our outer life as a mirror of our inner life.  The video quality was uneven and narrowly escaped being an infomercial for David Friedman's methods. Despite this the video is worth watching. I have recommended it to several of my friends.,1381622400,,373,5.114754098360656

However, I knew there was still more to be gained and The Thought Exchange has given me a path or a mental model to break past the plateau I had reached.  thank you David for using your life as a study of thought.  You've produced a very practical tool.",1380585600,,522,4.51063829787234

5115039,4,B007Z62VJ0,"If you've been studying this for a while this is a nice wrap up. But again, I'd like to know if the do loop on the beat was ""engineered"" in a tone to drill the information into the subconscious - or if he was throwing his pal a bone to do the music - I found it annoying and had to tune it out.

He should make this into a kit with all the graphics on 11"" x 17"" laminate and charge $500.00 for it.",1370736000,,397,3.6705882352941175
5115040,5,B007Z62VJ0,"This film is packed with knowledge about the theory of ""The Thought Exchange"" that David Friedman began and wrote a book about. It gives a new spin on the Law of Attraction, and I would give it serious consideration to become more open to all possibilities and take on the world. The film is inspirational and motivating and gives a practical way to approach positive thinking in life.",1365120000,,385,4.676470588235294
5115041,1,B007Z62VJ0,"I watched the trailer and thought I would find this book interesting, however, was not quite what I expected.  A lot of repetition that seemed to go nowhere.  Sorry.  Perhaps someone else will find it more insightful.",1364256000,3,217,4.8108108108108105
5115042,2,B007Z62VJ0,"Well I really approach Manifestation as somewhere between new metaphysics and new physics, and need some science bent ( Show Me).  The makers DO have an angle and agenda, and criticize named other 'methods'. Still all this is is a flip or tweeks on the ones they talk about! In some ways its just a big infomercial as far as I can see. There might be a little bit of a redeeming factor in the flip....' I never thought of it that way exactly.', but don't think its worth watching for that.
It has 2 stars for that, and because possibly it could help someone who has used these named other methods to understand them in a different way or get a handle on manifestation by looking at it a bit up-side down.
If nothing is working for you  and you are desperate, this video may work for people who have a particular type of everyday habitual thinking pattern where other methods haven't helped. If you coach you might want to watch it for the same reason -- to help those who just 'Don't Get It' --or to figure out your own angle to sell!",1363305600,3,1034,4.297435897435897

5115045,5,B007Z62VJ0,Definitely profound and thought provoking. Relates a lot to Buddhist concepts about the mind. Great cconcept itself just too bad it is still probably hard for a lot of people to follow.,1359590400,2,185,4.8125
5115046,2,B007Z62VJ0,"I had higher hopes for this video, but sadly the inspiration was not there. This video does not rival The Secret in any way.  Friedman's whole premise on why we don't get what we want is because we don't pay attention to our body sensations.  However, in my experience, as a very intuitive person and one that has learned to pay very close attention to the physiology (a term he never used, but is what he is talking about) of my body, I've gotten burned many times when I did not listen.  Friedman confesses to having an anxiety and other disorders, and this practice he calls the Thought Exchange worked for him.  I agree if you have severe mental health disorders than practicing something as he has outlined might work, but not for the normal and healthy. Listen to your gut, listen to your body, otherwise you will regret it.",1359417600,2,830,4.513333333333334

5115048,3,B007Z62VJ0,"The movie has some valuable ideas, but it isn't particularly captivating in style. The concept that sensations - not to be confused with feelings - can be responsible for our successes or failures was new to me.  Failure to lose weight, for example, is caused by the unwillingness to accept and embrace the sensations we feel when we think about not being able to eat our favorite, fattening foods.  I must admit that I've given this more than cursory thought as a result of watching this film. I have suffered for several years from near debilitating grief over losing someone I loved, and changing my approach to grief by dealing with it as a sensation has helped me a great deal. The thoughts in this film are worth considering; the appeal of its technical aspects are pretty bad ... hence my 3 star rating, smack dab in the middle of really good and really bad.",1358553600,4,865,4.574193548387097

We are encouraged to sit with with the discomforting feelings that surface in our life, and not to run from them.  Like anything else, it's all in applying what we learn.
