I used an educational site to help explain the plot and characters.",1433376000,,181,4.6875

8431189,4,B004IT5CHU,"Une Vie de Chat is a wonderfully nostalgic movie that harks back to an earlier period in animation.  The feel is very European, as it should be, as it is set in Paris.  Couple this with a great jazz score that just enhances the visuals to really set the mood.  The movie is short at just over an hour with ending credits.  My DVD is a European import so it works only on region-free DVD players here in the US.  I'm assuming a US (NTSC) version has or will be released for those without region-free players.
  With that aside, the movie revolves around a Parisian cat with two owners, one by day, one by night, whose lives one day intersect.  The owner by day, is a young girl who was rendered mute by her Father's tragic death at the hands of gangsters.  At night, the cat joins a very adept, and gentlemanly, burglar as he carries out his heists.  Curious of her cats nightly forays, the young girl follows and there their lives, as well as those of the girl's mother and the gangsters intertwine...  I don't want to give away the plot so I will leave it there.
 If you want an animated feature that is not Disney/Pixar oriented, then this is a very good one to view.  I do recommend it.",1341705600,,1189,4.278026905829597
