7883608,3,6305131376,"Kickboxer's Tears offers a number of good fight scenes with many opportunities for talented women to display their martial arts prowess, which is really the only reason to watch it- don't expect too much from the story.  The fights are quite well done, and it would have earned 4 or 5 stars instead of 3 if it wasn't for the full screen format, which cuts off a lot of the action- this is a movie that needs to be seen in wide screen format to be fully appreciated.  Also, the Tai Seng release is English dubbed with no option for subtitles; the dubbing isn't too bad, but it still would have been better with subtitles.  Hopefully the studio will offer a future release that corrects these deficiencies.  I'd be willing to pick up a new copy if they did.",1174521600,,755,4.410071942446043
7883609,2,6305131376,"Moon Lee is THE ONLY saving grace this film has. She does good acting,has good fighting skills-but against poor filming,and cardboard characters-it doesn't hold water.
 Despite the film dates, it seems like an early seventies film and not a good one.
 If you're looking for HK femme fatale fighting-Heroic Trio,Executioners,Wing Chun,or even Zero Woman (Japanese-but fits the genre).
 ""I must avenge my brothers death""-hmmm,never heard that line before....",1018051200,4,456,5.676470588235294
7883610,3,6305131376,"I really liked this film as Moon Lee shows some great fighting action throughout the movie. When she stretches during one training scene, you gotta pay attention. The bad part of this dvd is that the master used was already in bad shape. It really just looks like an old vhs copy that's been degrading over the years. And the dubbing...as usual, is quite bad. Can't anyone ever make a decent voice dub over?",972950400,5,407,4.513513513513513
7883611,5,6305131376,"Kickboxer's Tears showcases the talents of one of the greatest Hong Kong action actresses, Moon Lee.
