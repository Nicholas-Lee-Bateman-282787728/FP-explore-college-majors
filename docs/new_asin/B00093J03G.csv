8057029,5,B00093J03G,"THE SON is a quiet film that ends up shouting its agony through silence. Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne have filmed what at first appears to be just an ordinary working class man's life (Olivier, a carpenter with apprentices, played with subtle perfection by Olivier Gourmet), following it closely, slyly introducing Olivier's ex-wife (Isabella Soupart) with whom he no longer has contact save for a tragedy they share, and then darkens the picture with the presence of a 16 year old apprentice Francis (Morgan Marinne) who we instantly know has some mystery behind him. Olivier watches the boy's every move, discovers that the boy has just been released form prison where he was incarcerated since age 11 for theft and murder. Olivier realizes this is the boy responsible for his son's death five years ago and he takes Francis under his wing, his motivation remains unsure until the film's surprising end. This is verismo at its peak - just an emotionally charged story, simple, without accoutrements. There is no music soundtrack, only silence and very very little dialogue. But because of this starkness, the significance of the movie is all the more powerful. Perhaps this film is not for everyone: patience and a parcel of time are required to savour it. But THE SON is one of those films that stays in you gut long after the viewing. Grady Harp, April 12",1334966400,,1359,4.887445887445887
8057030,4,B00093J03G,"This is a film from Belgium. A carpentry teacher gets a new student. The student murdered his son when he was 11. At first, he didn't accept him in his class. Then he changes his mind. You can see, no, I would say feel the teacher's emotions. Of course, the young man doesn't know.

I will not give away the ending but what would you do if you were in this man's place? Plan revenge? Kill him? I don't believe in ""an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"". I believe in mercy.",1154476800,,472,4.0212765957446805
8057031,5,B00093J03G,"See the title, see the DVD cover (two carrying wood beams), see the allegory.  (To say much more would spoil it.)  Quiet and humble, THE SON is about relationship, guilt, redemption.  A somberly emotive film.  The movie's French and not easy to find, but for those with pensive sensibilities, particularly about ultimate things, I recommend it for the sheer differentness of its allegorical presentation.",1151798400,,404,5.265625
8057032,5,B00093J03G,"This is one of the best filmed movies I've ever seen.  The actors, director, and camera crew are gifted with superb storytelling skills that keep you glued to the screen as you follow Olivier and Francis through the film.",1122940800,3,221,4.666666666666667
