from the 70's. Starring Clint Walker, Peter
Graves and David Jansen these TV movies are
made by the director of NightStalker and even
seem like episodes from the tv series. Moon
of the Wolf and Scream of the Wolf are the
best. Very well directed and acted as all Dan
Curtis movies! Scream of the Wolf about killings
in a small town and Graves and Walker are old
hunting pals who don't see eye to eye on the
killings! A great surprise ending! Moon of the
Wolf with Jansen and Bradford Dillman filmed in
Louisiana is a rare but great southern werewolf
movie. There is a curse on a rich family but is
is really a curse or just murder? Snow Beast is
an okay Bigfoot movie but nothing great. Wolfman
seems to be a british movie at first until the
southern accents kick in and the not so good acting
and directing. At the end shows it was filmed in
Alabama? oh well it's not that bad. 3 out of 4 great.",1195084800,,941,4.175824175824176
7976267,4,B00007G1UK,"This is the first 4-DVD set I've purchased, and I have to say I'm pretty pleased with it.  I grew up on 1970's made-for-TV movies, and this really brought back a lot of memories as far as the style and pace of these sorts of films.  Video and audio quality were very good for all the films except Scream of the Wolf, which looked like an old, worn print that had a lot of white specks and scratches.  It was a bit distracting, but not too terrible.

Moon of the Wolf:  Stars David Janssen as a sheriff in a Louisiana town.  People start turning up dead and they've got animal bite marks on them.  Looks like there's a werewolf around.  Most of the movie is spent with Janssen getting friendly with the local rich girl, much to the expense of the film's pacing.  However, it does have a few suspenseful scenes, and is fairly satisfying, just so long as you're not expecting anything exciting.

Scream of the Wolf:  Stars Peter Graves and Clint Walker.  People are turning up dead, killed by an animal.  Graves is an author who helps the police investigate.  Walker is the prime suspect, he's very concerned with everyone being bored and wants to spice their lives up.  I really didn't care for the characters in this one, and it's also pretty slow moving.  There's a neat twist at the end, but I didn't think it was believable.  One of those movies I may watch again, if I'm REALLY bored some night.

Snowbeast:  I really enjoyed this one.  A Yeti is attacking people at a Colorado ski resort, and the resort manager teams up with an old buddy and his wife to hunt it down.  Some nice '70s melodrama, lots of good suspense, very likable characters and good pacing.  I've already watched this one twice - it's worth the purchase price all by itself.

Wolf Man:  This one has great atmosphere (sort of like a Hammer film), but awful acting.  These people would be below average if they were in a high school play.  It concerns a guy who's father died (unbeknownst to him, murdered by his family who are in a Satanic cult).  He comes back to the family home for the first time in years, strikes up a romance with a local girl, and tries to get to the bottom of what happened to his father.  It's dull, the actions of the characters are rather strange (bad script), and like I say, the acting is dreadful across the board.  But there's that nice atmosphere;  the only reason to watch this.  Overall, probably the worst film of the set.",1165881600,,2430,4.417607223476298
7976268,3,B00007G1UK,"BEASTS OF TERROR is a collection of 4 made-for-tv monster movies from the 70s. DVD #1-SIDE A- MOON OF THE WOLF- David Janssen is a sheriff in a small Louisiana town plagued by a werewolf (who looks more like a hairy guy with a dirty nose). There's only one good action scene involving the alleged lycanthrope, where it kills a deputy and a prisoner in the town jail. The rest is a test of sheer willpower and patience.  SIDE B- SCREAM OF THE WOLF- Peter Graves is a man called in by police to investigate a brutal mutilation murder in a small California beach town. Byron (Clint Walker) is his hunter friend, a man obsessed with the weakness of the human race. Byron really needs a hug! He won't help to find the killer. Of course, Byron is even more sinister than we think. Is he the werewolf? Is there a werewolf at all? Dan Curtis (Trilogy Of Terror) does a fine job of keeping SOTW from being silly. Matheson delivers another good script. Not a bad movie.  DVD #2- SIDE A- SNOW BEAST- A woman is torn to pieces by a yeti while skiing at the Rill ski resort in Colorado (I wonder if THAT was in their brochure). Enter Bo Svenson as Gar and Yvette Mimieux as his wife Ellen. Gar is a 1968 winter olympics gold medalist and Ellen's a tv reporter. Together, they help the resort's manager and the sheriff (Clint Walker) to track down and kill the beast. There are good and bad scenes in this one. A good scene is where a member of the ski patrol is grabbed by the noggin by the huge claw of the creature. A bad scene is where a pile of logs rolls into our heroes' camper. One reviewer already pointed out that the logs were rolling into the side of the camper, yet somehow jumped into the back of it. My question is, how / why did they park the camper under a pile of logs in the first place?? Anyway, I liked this one. The monster ain't bad and the actors are adequate. SIDE B- WOLF MAN- This one is really bad. A man returns home to get his inheritence and is turned into a werewolf by a satanic cult, led by the local preacher. The movie drags like an anchor, moving at a painful pace. The acting is dismal, but enjoyable in a ""Plan 9"" sort of way. The wolf man himself is just another hairy guy with pointy teeth. Lots to laugh at. All in all, BEASTS OF TERROR is a mixed bag of furry fiends and fun...",1080518400,6,2306,4.191441441441442
7976269,4,B00007G1UK,"All four films in this collection have very good quality pictures.  Although going by average quality of the films themselves this is one of Brentwood's less strong 4-movie collections, there isn't one single movie that I outright hated.  And at this price, you only need one good film you are not likely to find elsewhere to make it worthwhile.  Going from the weakest film to the best:
SNOW BEAST, a TV movie, takes the then-recent film Jaws, turns the shark into an abominable snowman, and the beach resort into a ski resort, and throws out everything that was good about that film, including any suspense or interesting characters.  There are some things worth slight amusement. For example, when the camper (replacing the fishing boat in Jaws) is knocked over by a bunch of rolling logs, somehow the camper winds up filled with the large logs although the whole thing, including the side on which it was hit, is still completely intact!  Everyone involved in the film must have failed physics.
MOON OF THE WOLF is a TV movie about a local cop investigating brutal murders which may or may not have been committed by an animal (of course we all know it is a werewolf).  Since it is a TV movie it is quite tame and the budget is low, which is not necessarily an impediment to a good film, but it is all too predictable and fails to build suspense.  It even completely fails to make any use of potentially interesting local flavour (Cajuns, bayous or local legends) except for the presence of one bed-ridden francophone.  Even the fine performances fail to make this film anything more than an adequate time waster.
WOLF MAN is a low budget 1970s movie which was released theatrically only in the southern states.  Like most rural films it has a certain charm (local playhouse quality acting and all).  It isn't really a copy of the original film, but pretty well everything in it had been done countless times before (in the original, in dozens of Hammer films, etc.)  Therefore, since the film has little action, but depends upon building suspense, it doesn't work as well as it should.  With such nice touches as the devil-whorshipping southern preacher this film could be a classic if it had come out before most of the things in it became cliched.
In contrast, SCREAM OF THE WOLF, which is the best entry in this collection, is very original.  WHICH is why it will actually disappoint viewers who WANT it to follow expectations.  Intelligently scripted by Richard Matheson (who scripted the best of Roger Corman's Poe films), competently directed by Dan (Dark Shadows) Curtis, and filled with excellent performances, this film easily surpasses the limitations imposed upon it by nature of being an old TV movie (including by hinting at some things not mentioned on TV in those days).  I don't want to risk spoiling anything by describing this movie in more detail.
With 3 out of 4 of the movies being 1970s made-for-TV horror films, this collection does have some nostalgia value for those of us who grew up on such things, and there are many familiar faces and bit players you rarely see anymore.  Other than for that reason, and for ""Scream of the Wolf"", I can't give this collection a very high recommendation.  Younger viewers who have no attention spans as a result of growing up on splatter films might want to give this one a pass.",1054166400,8,3345,4.719931271477663
