5085520,4,B007GMKX70,"i kind of enjoyed this little film, and thought that it was quite scary and tense. when looking at the dvd cover, you are led to believe that the monster attacks a beautiful girl that is getting ready to go for a dip. but the cover is a little deceptive.. there is a scene in the film but it is where two girls wade thru the water. The overall storyline was excellent and the first 15 mins. goes to great lenghts to explain the story of the monsters creation. the filming is really great and the scenery and filming location was great. the two guys and 3 super cute gals (especially the goth girl) were very good with their lines. some of the filming took place at night and could have been alot brighter. there is a scene of a blond gal that wanders around the woods half naked, and it is never explained what happens to her. great background music and woods scenery. the acting was alright, just wish there would have been more romance/lovemaking scenes between the couples. A lot of the couples running through the woods (somewhat tedious), and yelling for each other. A Scene of two of the girls wading thru the pond could have been played up a bit with closer film angles. some of the parts are somewhat corny and some lines are somewhat hilarious. Just wonder if maybe there is a uncut version with key missing scenes? Overall a fine film that would be great for couples looking for a little entertainment on a saturday night.",1381449600,5,1432,4.448669201520913

5085524,3,B007GMKX70,Like Insidious. How refreshing it is to see a horror movie without love-making and sex. My favorite part of this movie is the creature.,1502496000,3,135,4.666666666666667

5085530,3,B007GMKX70,"The film takes 15 minutes to explain the origin of Wicker demon all the while it displays credits. Finally we get to the present day as a group of young adults take a back road and get lost. Add in the proverbial bad service station attendant, no phone bars. and the woods playing tricks on them and the film works as a spoof on horror films. Unfortunately much of the film isn't a spoof. The opening sequence taking 15 minutes was 10 minutes too long. The kids wondering in the woods got boring, which they divided up by showing us more people in the woods. The creature looked great, too bad we didn't see much of it. Also the budget was too low to show us a decent attack scene. 2 1/2 stars.

5085531,2,B007GMKX70,"The cover, like most movies, looks awesome, the movie however fails to compete with it's own artwork. If they could recast this movie with people who could act, better camera's, and better lighting (some scenes are so dark its hard to see whats going on) it could have been pretty damn good. The story itself is fun, and the special effects were great, seriously, the creature looks awesome and super creepy. The gore was also done quite well, and the locations worked great. The actors/actresses were pretty bad, not completely unlikeable, but bad acting, they just seemed so stiff and didn't sound natural with the way they delivered their lines. The transfer to the dvd was also pretty darn bad, alot of the time it looks really fuzzy and there are numerous glitches throughout the movie. Another thing that i didn't like was that there were a few things that were never explained, like the naked blonde girl covered in blood wondering the woods, no idea where she came from or what exactly happened to her. I enjoyed this a little bit, i'll admit, but it was really just because of the special effects, if you're really bored, like monster movies, and have seen every other one on earth, i'd suggest watching this, if not i'd pass.",1382400000,2,1235,4.695852534562212
