7963930,3,B0000687LX,"I watched this film on a Hispanic movie channel on cable TV.  OK Mexican-made, Spanish-language late 70's melodrama.  A pair of thieves dynamite a safe, and haphazardly steal money at a facility by the docks.  One of the robbers escapes with the help of his wife/girlfriend, I'm never sure which.  The other one is shot, injured, caught and sent to a lovely prison where the guards beat to death the inmates for the smallest infraction.  Meanwhile the first guy and the girl end up in a shack by the beach way out in the boonies.  They make their living by diving for sponges, where the woman sells them for eats, smokes, booze and cosmetics.  Eventually the other guy escapes and finds his partner.  Now trouble ensues with an eternal triangle.  The woman is too much woman for any one man, but there is not enough woman to go around for two men.  To add to the heated sexual tension the woman goes around (INCLUDING THE VILLAGE) in a floor-length skirt with a wide slit cut up to her waist and a see-through barely there top, AND her name is Erotica.  What was anyone thinking.  No mention is ever made of the stolen loot.  The three stars are for the scenics.  The village, though poor is magnificently surrounded by trees.  The shack looks as if the first big wind will blow it down, but it sits on a cliff overlooking a beautiful beach.  The story is dumb but the film deserves three stars and more for the scenery.  I wonder where it was filmed.",1507420800,,1451,4.4562737642585555
