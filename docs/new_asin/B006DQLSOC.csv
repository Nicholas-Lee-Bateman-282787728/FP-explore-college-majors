8496744,5,B006DQLSOC,"Excellent  performance,  Kevin Kenner  for Chopin  Piano  Concerto  in  E minor,  Janusz Oljniczak for Chopin  Piano in F minor. and Nelson Goerner  for  Chopin  Andante spianato & Grande Polonaise  brillante in e  flat  major, op22.  These 2  dvd  truly  worth  the price,  especially you don't  find  Chopin  Andante  spianate & Grande  Polonaise brillante  in E flat major  DVD  easily.  I am  so  pleased  to  purchased  the  dvd,
and  from  their  interview  I  learn  some  information  about  Chopin  and  this  is  knowledge.  I know  there  are  so  many  Chopin  Piano concerto  1  and 2  dvd  on  the  market,  which I  already  have,  but  I  go  back  to this one  very  frequently.",1422489600,,695,4.672727272727273
