1624465,3,B00005MEP9,"""Meet the Beat Alls"" is a good collection of episodes, but it falls a bit flat in the content department. ""Powerpuff Bluff"" and ""Down n' Dirty"" each offered 10 eps; ""The Mane Event"" listed only 6, but had a couple of extras and the ""Whoopass Stew!"" short film thrown in. This time, there are only 7, with no extra ones.
Except for the DVD goodies, there's nothing to set this disc apart from your average homemade tape. Think twice before you buy.
(On the above virus warning: When the first pressing was found to be contaminated, they were recalled and destroyed. The copy I ordered from Amazon in December 2001 came up clean.)",1008633600,3,628,4.566371681415929
1624466,5,B00005MEP9,"This is definatlry a milestone in PPG history! Overflowing with Beatles jokes and parodies, this episode is one of the best Beatles satires I have seen. And this isn't just casual referneces. These people did their research. They not only did they refer to parts of songs that one would have to really know the song to get, they also used a small clip of the Beat-Alls ( Mojo, Princess, Him, and Fuzzy)beating up the Beatles from the old 60's Saturday morning cartoon. They also used famous quotes from the Beatles such as John's ""Will all the people in the cheaper seats clap their hands and all the others just rattle your jewlery."" If your a Beatles fan or just really like the Powerpuff girls, I highly recommend this video!",1005868800,,728,4.607692307692307
1624467,5,B00005MEP9,"I'm not THAT big a fan of the Beatles, or the Powerpuff Girls.
I've only occasionally watched the PpG, and, while I'm familiar
with most of the Beatles music, like anyone who listens to
classic rock radio, I'm hardly an expert in them.
""Meet the Beat-Alls"", though, is screamingly funny. Yes, there
are jokes that will fly right over the heads of casual Fab Four
fans, but if you know the songs reasonably well, there's plenty
here to keep you amused.
You may be saying, ""But I taped this off the air -- why buy
a copy?"" Well, despite the fact its a crystal-clear DVD
transfer, the disk includes Mojo Jojo's commentary on ""Meet
the Beat-Alls"", which has even more Beatles humor.",1004832000,12,678,4.565573770491803
1624468,5,B00005MEP9,"I have to agree that the definite highlight of the Powerpuff Girls are their satirical references to pop culture. Take for instance the episode where they meet Lucky Captain Rabbit King, mascot of his own cereal (does that ring a bell?) They do it again in ""Meet the Beat-Alls."" After Mojo Jojo, Princess, Him, and Fuzzy Lumpkins can't take one more whupping from the PPG, they band together to from the Beat-Alls. Here's where the fun starts: as the episode progresses, the lyrics from the everlasting songs of the Beatles play in tune to the word play. Some examples are Hey Jude and Help! It will give you more than a chuckle after watching ""Meet the Beat-Alls"" more than once.",1004227200,11,680,4.675

1624471,5,B00005MEP9,"PowerPuff Girls Episode EVER. So says my daughter who then grew up to be a huge Beatles fan much to her father's delight. If you're a Beatles nut who wonders if you can spot every single reference to them here, consider it a challenge to yourself and try it because it's a ton of fun.",1390003200,,284,4.181818181818182

1624473,5,B00005MEP9,I got it for my father-in-law who was a big Beatles fan.  The episode was just chocked full of Beatles puns.  He is a bit older so he simply found them mildly amusing.  But no complaints.,1363305600,,187,4.138888888888889

1624475,5,B00005MEP9,"I have to admit that I have always had a soft spot for the Powerpuff Girls.  I find the frequently tongue-in-cheek humour to be very witty and like most good cartoons are, this one is thoroughly entertaining for both kids and adults alike.  My favourite Cartoon Network character is actually Dexter's Lab but until they release that on DVD I guess this will have to do as second best.  This DVD has been very well thought out and designed and contains good bonus features as well as 10 great episodes.  ""Meet the Beat-alls""  has got to be the best Powerpuff Girls episode ever.  The spoof on the Beatles is extremely hilarious and is a real treat for Beatles fans as well.  Highly recommended for a good laugh!",1188000000,,710,4.543307086614173
1624476,4,B00005MEP9,"Fortunately, ""Meet The Beat Alls"" is one of the few shining moments. When Mojo, Princess, Fuzzy Lumpkins, and Him realize that the four together can defeat the Powerpuff Girls, they team up to become the Beat Alls. Be it album covers, song titles, or that one person blamed for breaking up the Fabs, there are more Beatles references than one can throw a power punch at. I found forty-five. (Rating: 5)
""Bought And Scold"" has Princess Morebucks having her father buy her Townsville. Once becoming mayor, the Princess makes crime legal, to the chagrin of the Powerpuff Girls, who become unemployed, so to speak. Quick, what's that saying, ""hoist by her own petard""? Or is it she who lives by the decree... whatever. (Rating: 4)
""Bubblevision"" has Bubbles having eye trouble and having to wear glasses. Unfortunately, Blossom and Buttercup laugh and make fun of her. Crimony, stop picking on Bubbles, girls! Pop culture reference: giant ants and the Blondie song ""Attack Of The Giant Ants."" (Rating: 5)
Inbetween are a few goodies, such as a brief clip of Mojo on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, the Apples of Stereo video of ""Signal In The Sky,"" featuring the Fish Balloon from ""Uh Oh Dynamo,"" and a brief look at the making of the Powerpuff Girls movie with creator Craig McCracken and the talented ladies who do the Powerpuff voices. Cavadini, Strong, and Daily, keep it up! (Rating: 4)
""Jewel Of The Aisle"" involves a thief who steals a jewel which he accidentally drops in a factory manufacturing Lucky Cap'n Rabbit King Nuggets, which are a cross between Trix and Captain Crunch. Guess who buys the cereal? There's an obvious reference to the Trix rabbit and the thief's failed attempts to get it is reminiscent of Warner Brothers cartoons. (Rating: 3.5)
""Collect Her"" is an unpleasant piece of work about Lenny, an obsessed Powerpuff Girls memorabilia collector who discovers to his horror that his collection is--(gasp!) complete. What else is there to collect? I say unpleasant because of what some fan obsessions can lead to: can anyone say John Lennon or Rebecca Schaeffer? (Rating: 2)
The Time Squad bonus cartoon involves going back in time to help out Lincoln, who, fed up with being dubbed Honest Abe, becomes a jerk bent on playing practical jokes on people. Including these other cartoons is reminiscent of the B-feature after the A-picture done back in the 1930's. (Rating: 3)

1624477,5,B00005MEP9,"Awesome DVD!!!  I love the Meet the Beat-Alls cartoon when I saw it on the air...totally cracked me up!  Add in Mojo Jojo's commentary and you have a winner.  We love Mojo Jojo!  The mayor's commentary is also nice, as are the rest of the included episodes! I am an old crusty mom of 38 who enjoys watching this show with my 4 year old!",1026777600,5,336,4.123076923076923
1624478,4,B00005MEP9,"""Meet the Beat-Alls"" presents the best argument that cartoons that entertain adults will entertain the kids, too. The Beatle allusions come fast and thick, but the comedy appeals to the small kids in my house who still think ""Yellow Submarine"" is a song for bathtime. Mojo Jojo commentary cracks me up, too. It's a pleasure to watch these cartoons with my kids.",1015891200,5,361,4.838709677419355
