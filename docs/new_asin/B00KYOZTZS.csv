8662715,5,B00KYOZTZS,"Wonderful to have this old 1972 Bob Elfstrom documentary on Pete Seeger available on DVD.  This film was made when Pete was still battling the cruelties of the blacklist and at times the film is a little creaky  but the  message of peace and good will that the filmmakers are sending is so overwhelming that you are willing to forgive the dodgy sound that pops up every now and again, at least on my copy.  My admiration for Pete goes back a long, long way and it was extremely sad to lose him recently but if any of us had led half as a rewarding life as Pete did with his  unyielding commitment to peace, human rights and  environmentalism, we would be very satisfied and the world would be a heck of a lot better off.  This forty year old documentary which I had not seen before highlights such events as his anti-Vietnam war stance, his battle to clean up the Hudson with the Clearwater sloop, a rare appearance on television on the Johnny  Cash Show,  his remembrances of Woody Guthrie and family gatherings especially with wife Toshi  and  with his father, the renowned musicologist  Charles Seeger.  And of course many, many great folk songs performed in Pete's unforgettable style.
N.B.  My copy bought through Amazon is a European DVD but it has region zone ""0"" listed on the back.  Although I have a region free player and am able to play all zones, I was under the impression that ""0""  (as this DVD is) indicated ""zone free"" and could be played on any type of DVD player.",1414022400,10,1482,4.473880597014926
