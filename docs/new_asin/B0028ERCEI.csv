8356201,1,B0028ERCEI,"This movie will not teach you a thing about avalanche saftey, it will show you a lot of avalanches, snowboarding, skiing, and idiots telling their stories about how they barely survived because they didn't bother to do any checking before they took off.  Sad and Pathetic, don't waste your money.",1326672000,,296,4.92
