Nothing that would entice a cat to give a second glance. It was so bad that I couldn't continue to watch it. This publisher should be ashamed. Would give minus stars if I could.",1510704000,,303,4.428571428571429

8564820,5,B00BA5BBF2,"My wife and I and our 4 cats absolutely love this Blu-ray and DVD set. It's packed full of information and entertainment for both you and your cat. We really love the looping feature too the cats are entertained for hours!  We especially have to use it for one of our sick kitties right now and we have to keep her in a separate room away from the others but this DVD calms her down and is helping her recuperate... we keep her in one extra room, so it's nice to have two of these so we can play while we're gone... one in the room upstairs with our sick kitty and one in the living room big screen downstairs for the other three.  All the cats seem a lot more relaxed but very attentive when this is on, and they're also more playful..and almost love playing with TV sometimes but they don't - end up just watching or relaxed.  Keeps them mentally and physically active for hours but also relaxes at the same time almost as if they are taking part of the activities.  I highly recommend this if you are away at times and your cats are lonely especially if you know your cat has separation anxiety this would be a perfect cure. Works great when you have to separate a sick cat with behavior issues from the others too.  Well worth the price of admission!",1506988800,,1254,4.2521008403361344
