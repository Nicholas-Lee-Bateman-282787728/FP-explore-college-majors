Scenes that may really test the resolve of most people or just make them run out of the room :) anyways, the lead actress has no qualms about
going full frontal through 80% of the film and Olaf the director is one of the most creative gore minds out there.",1421712000,2,403,4.246753246753247

It's basically about a woman's soul (or you can always say it's all a delusion of her dying mind or something else if you want because you can interpret the film in your way) meeting a muscular humanoid demon in an octopus or squid mask who guides her through four levels of color. Each of these levels is tinted with a particular color as she witnesses assorted atrocities, and she also learns from the demon about the different meaning of colors in different cultures. So in the first red level, we've got a tinted or shaded screen of red; and this is followed by the levels green, blue and yellow with those colors tinting or shading the levels. The last yellow level only lasts a quick moment with her learning about colors, while the other levels are the ones with all the horror. Within the first 10 minutes you get full nudity and blood. After this, you'll only have to wait less than 15 minutes for her to enter the levels. In each level, Holtzfurtner is fully nude. Completely naked, she witnesses all sorts of extreme gore. This includes genital mutilation, urination scenes, dismemberments, and more extreme stuff. I don't want to spoil the film, so I won't mention too much about the gore scenes. In the red and green levels she watches all gore, and she finally partakes in some hacking in the blue level to defend herself. When the levels end, this only leads to more gore and full nudity until the film ends. Irene Hultzfurtner was in her 40s when she was in this film. Having an older woman fully nude throughout most of the film is different compared to other exploitation flicks. She looks good, and a lot of her nudity is really graphic. I'm a fan of German horror, so I personally liked the directing. I also thought it was decently acted and pretty well scored. This is only recommended if you're looking for overloads of graphic gore and nudity.

Amazon lists the running time as 73 minutes. However, I checked the disc, and it actually runs 76 minutes. I can't find any information about this being cut, so I assume it's the fully uncut version. Usually, a film like this would be at that movie-censorship site if it's cut. It still isn't there, so I think it's uncut. The behind the scenes extra is in German language only with no subtitles. The DVD quality is very good. There's a graphic genital mutilation scene during the red level that fades in and out to black, but it looks like that's the way it was filmed. During the green level, there's a graphic scene when a woman bites a guys manhood off, as well as scenes of urination; these are shown clearly. It certainly looks like this DVD is fully uncut, but I haven't compared it to an import version.",1401840000,,2799,4.542574257425742
