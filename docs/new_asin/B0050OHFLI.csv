8451571,4,B0050OHFLI,"I am a school psychologist in an elementary school and used this video as a part of a lesson with our 4th grade to create more empathy and understanding for a student in their grade with Autism.  It does a great job explaining how people can think differently, and the kids' perspectives im the video were very powerful.  Some bits are a little goofy or drag on, but overall I found it to be a valuable teaching tool.",1454803200,,417,4.333333333333333

8451573,5,B0050OHFLI,"As a social cognitive and speech therapist, I was lucky to find the series of Coulter Videos.  They are immensely useful and practical tools by which to educate teachers, administrators, parents, siblings and general education classmates about the challenges of having neurodiversities (Asperger's Syndrome, ADD, ADHD, Nonverbal Learning Disorder, Pdd-Nos, Autism).  These videos are affordable and give easily understood visual examples of what is happening for individuals with social, organizational and/or sensory challenges.....and how a neurotypical person might be helpful in daily interaction.  Coulter Video is a family run business with unique, quality products that can be used to make a difference for people every where.

This video was particularly helpful for fourth grade classes who had a child included on the spectrum (high functioning to Asperger's).  It facilitated discussion both during and after viewing on the part of classmates.  A helpful Idea is to have students write about what they learned from the film (and talk you add to it).  I have been amazed at the response.  I do believe this would be appropriate from grade three on up....  Other videos might be made to highlight kids with moderate to low functioning differences, but when it comes to neurodiversities, the Coulters have done a bang up job representing a variety of students.  Customer service cannot be beat.

8451574,3,B0050OHFLI,"I rated this DVD as OK because I think in the wrong hands or if not used correctly it could do more damage than good. In the right hands of course there could be a very powerful message!  My problem with the film is that many of the students are almost too stereotypically different. I would say if there is a way for you to preview this(from library or borrow from someone) and view it before you use it, that's the best idea. I am a special education teacher and a parent wanted to show it to a third grade class. After seeing it, I said I did not think it was a good idea. We decided if we use it, kids would need to be older..fourth or fifth grade.  I did purchase the film to show at a graduate class I teach in Inclusion because I want students to see how the film could be used in both positive and negative ways. The overall message of acceptance and understanding is great I am only concerned that some of that may get lost. Try to view the film yourself. If it matches up to the students you are trying to include, it may be useful to you. If the students seem significantly different then perhaps not.",1406246400,,1112,4.143518518518518
8451575,5,B0050OHFLI,"My oldest son was recently diagnosed on the Autism spectrum. We live in a rural community that does not tolerate much deviation from the norm and where everyone knows who everyone is. He is in fourth grade now, but we starting seeing problems when we moved to here in 2nd grade. We had a boy, who was the ""new kid,"" who had some learning disabilities, who came from a school with much more diversity, and who was trying to make friends. The other kids here saw differences in him and as the social structures changed in school, trying to make friends for him was difficult. He talked at a different rate and pace than other children, he didn't understand the unspoken social rules, he got ""stuck"" on certain subjects that he was extremely knowledgeable about, was ""too"" friendly with other students, and had a hard time understanding their humor. These kids saw him as different and did not accept him. His anxieties and attitude about school really started to affect him. We got the diagnosis from his counselor and tried to do as many things we could to help him with confidence and social understanding. I felt it was the school's job to help create a more positive atmosphere for him and other students with the same situation. So, I asked the school psychologist and principal to first and foremost do training with his teachers so that they understand how and why his brain worked and what we could do to help it. The teachers could have all of the knowledge in the world, but if the peers didn't accept him, he would fall apart internally. The school psychologist showed the video to the students and asked some high school football players to talk afterwards. This video was so relatable to the kids. It showed students with all types of disorders and how they think differently. It explained the positive points of having disorders, how the children who had them felt, and what other kids can do to help the student with the disorder. The school just showed the video last week. This video was well received by everyone at the school and they are looking in to buying it to use every year! I highly recommend this to schools who need some type of peer acceptance education! My son thinks he can tell a difference in some of his peers attitudes toward him! That makes it worth while! I'm actually thinking about just buying it myself for the school to have!",1315440000,2,2365,4.606635071090047
