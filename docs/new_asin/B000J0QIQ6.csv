2664629,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Three stories are interwoven in this little gem, leading to unexpected finale.

""Meant To Be"" is about an aging provision shopkeeper grappling with loneliness. Just when he is about to give up hope, he chances upon an autobiography which changes his life. The autobiography in this story is real - it is the story of Theresa Chan, who plays herself and shares her remarkable life experience in the film.

""So In Love"" is the bitter-sweet chronicles of two teenage girls in a love less ordinary. A chain of events spark off a flurry of SMS messages that will drastically rewrite the blueprints of their lives.

""Finding Love"" follows the mundane life of a middle aged security guard who has two loves in life -- food and a high flying professional who works in the same building he does. The first he indulges in with great passion; the second, alas, he can only admire from afar. He decides to bridge the divide with a letter.

The characters in the movie are fictitious except for Theresa Chan. Deaf and blind since she was 14, Theresa - who is now 61 - is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over her disabilities to live an amazing life. She is the film's beacon, a symbol of strength and hope.

With little dialogue and very delicate performances, the film explores the eternal questions of hope, fate, life choices and love.",1295481600,,1330,4.642553191489362

2664631,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Like most art films, this one moves very slowly. In fact, when I was one third into the film, I began thinking of turning it off. But I stayed with it and enjoyed it. The end result is that I found it quite powerful. The theme of all of them is lost love.

The film tells three stories that are loosely connected. One, based on facts, is the tale of a deaf and blind woman who, despite her disabilities, learns a new language, English, and learns how to help people. She had a man whom she loved, but he died of cancer. She learns how to live without him. Anther is a story of an old man and his wife who is suffering froom dementia. He is very depressed and is unable to pull out of his depression. The third is about two beautiful girls who have a satisfying lesbian relationship. But then one of the girls is attracted to a young man and still later by another girl. Her prior partner is heart broken when she abandons her. She messages her partner frequently, but the girl, apparently not knowing how to respond, refuses to answer. Then her prior partner sees her with another girl and she decides to commit suicide.",1287446400,2,1120,4.308056872037914
2664632,4,B000J0QIQ6,"At first, the 3 disparate story lines don't seem to converge at all:  an older man who is a shopkeeper with an ailing wife, the security guard who gorges himself night after night & who has a crush on a woman who works in the building he watches, and 2 teenage girls exchanging text messages.  But quietly & largely without much dialogue, the film moves along & eventually introduces Theresa Chan, a blind & deaf woman whose autobiography provides the narrative background behind the different plots.

As the title suggests, the film is about love & loneliness... The elderly shopkeeper lovingly lays out a dinner bowl for his wife who passed away.  The security guard tries to compose a love letter to his crush.  One of the teenage girl sends obsessive texts to the other one when their relationship runs its course.  All 3 stories unfold at the same time Theresa's story is told - about events of her life that led her to overcome her disabilities.

In the end, Theresa's story intersects with the storekeeper's, & the security guard's with the teenage girls', & there are different acts of love, both tragic.  But somehow Theresa's story of knocking down the walls of her life looms large and provides warmth & hope despite the tragic events of the other story lines.  This is a melancholy but a nice meditative movie that makes you think.",1250380800,,1343,4.705128205128205
2664633,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Be with me,  directed by Singapore's Eric Khoo, provides the best of what cinema has to offer: dialogue that is not dependent on words, acting that is so sublime is transcends acting and cinematography that makes you forget you are watching film. It was the official entry from Singapore for the 78th Academy Awards in the foreign-language category, but was disqualified because the majority of the less than five minutes of dialogue was in English. No matter-- the film could have easily won on the strength of its message, aptly delivered by Theresa Chan, the blind/deaf teacher on whom the film is based.

The film juxtaposes four life stories: a young girls affair with another girl, whose pained love is communicated through text messages, a security guard's stalking obsession with a businesswomen, who desperately tries to write her a love letter, an elderly shopkeeper's longing for his deceased wife, expressed through cooking, and the day to day life and observations about love, as typed by Theresa Chan. The stories are bound together by the common thread for communication and connectedness. While all the characters want so much to be seen and heard, it becomes clear that it is the heart--not eyes or ears- that sees and hears.

The actors are friends and acquaintances of the director. Most are not professional actors. Theresa Chan is played by herself . Perhaps that is why this film feels like the real thing.",1220572800,11,1428,4.96652719665272
2664634,4,B000J0QIQ6,"One has to be very patient with this movie. It moves with its own pace describing three parallel love stories.  One is a love of the elderly man for his wife who is dying in the hospital bed and his diffculty of letting her go after lifetime of living together.  Second is the story of the security guard in the office building who is obsessed with the young professional woman who works there.  He is too shy and insecure to approach her directly as his meekly existance is an outome of the childhood physical abuse from his father and brother.  The last story is the love crush between two high school girls and their sexual confusion that causes tragedy of enourmous proportions.  What connects them all is a young social worker who tends to these wounded souls with quiet patience and endurance.  We learn thru him a story of Theresa Chang a blind and deaf woman living independently.  Her story of courage and perseverance teaches all the protagonists an imporant lesson.  The second part of the film is extrimely powerful as Theresa's life story unfolds and we observe her life in silence as she gracefuly accepts all the hardships in her life with poise and determination.  I would qualify this film as a crossover between fiction and documentary -- which is why I am saying that one will have to be patient while watching this movie.  At the end, it all makes sense...And it is a wonderful life lesson to us all.",1193529600,6,1420,4.599206349206349
2664635,4,B000J0QIQ6,"The story is about three pairs of individuals, from disparate background in Singapore, looking for ""soulmates"" and not having much luck with it. Most of the characters are plagued by loneliness, frustration, rejections and procrastination. By a twist of fate their lives cross path with each other. Under a rather tragic circumstance, a ray of hope emerges for one of the pairs. This movie is quite sensitively directed and the cast and the acting are both very good. The movie is kind of slow, but the story line is unfolded nicely. Conversation is kept to the minimal in this movie, I think deliberatley to highten our awareness of the deaf and blind condition of Theresa Chan. It also explores the different modes of alternative communication: an old fashion typewriter which doesn't type right, email, instant messaging and the amazing language invented for communicating with the deaf and blind. Some of these modes of communication, even though is instantaneous, can be turned into a meduim of rejection and torture, while the slow and old fashion typewriter can be used to utter the most poignant feelings for some. The movie is quite satisfying, but slightly over-sentimentalized (as set by the tone of the title ""Be with me""). The movie contains scenes of teenage lesbian experience. The bonous short movie should not be missed.",1183420800,2,1337,5.0542986425339365
2664636,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Director Eric Khoo mixes fact with three fictional relationships in this remarkable exploration of the human longing to love and be loved. An elderly shopkeeper tenderly cares for his wife in the hospital, then struggles with deep loneliness after she dies. Two teenage girls communicate by email and text-messaging, but their gay relationship ends in tragedy. A middle-age, lecherous security guard stalks a gorgeous woman at a distance and, pathetically, finally writes her a love letter. Parallel to all of this is the real-life story of the deaf and blind Theresa Chan, a 61-year-old teacher of disabled children. Throughout the film she types her life story with deep reflections about love and longing. Fate brings these four stories together in a powerful conclusion. Be with Me won awards at five film festivals. Mainly in English, but some Chinese with English subtitles.",1169769600,15,880,5.24822695035461
2664637,3,B000J0QIQ6,"This is a really slow movie and you will need to have a lot of patience to enjoy the ""art"" aspect of this movie. There is very little dialogue and the background sounds do little to stimulate the movie.

I was attracted to the movie because it seems to have won several awards and because of the high user rating on Amazon. Given the many good art and foreign movie choices available on Amazon Prime, I should have give this one a pass that I rate at best 3 stars.",1364601600,,464,4.155555555555556
2664638,4,B000J0QIQ6,"This movie starts our a bit slow, but definitely picks up towards the end. A finely woven story which follows the lives a several Taiwanese individuals as they each find ways to deal with personal forms of betrayal, loss or loneliness.",1363219200,,235,4.7560975609756095

2664641,5,B000J0QIQ6,"I loved this movie - have watched it twice and loved it even more the second time - saw more and felt more.  The reviewers who were bored with it, I can understand - it's not a movie for everyone.  But the stories are very touching, very real, very haunting - the people and the images keep coming back to me here and there.  I recommend it highly for those who like deep stories that don't whack you over the head...the stories sort of unfold out of the characters.  The autobiographical story that comes along about half way through adds more weight and depth to the overall (disjointed) stories that the movie first presents...then it ties them all together in a lovely, lyrical way with a satisfying ending.  Magnificent.",1355011200,,725,4.589147286821706
2664642,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Amazing movie.. its interesting the entire movie doesn't contain many spoken words.. but the story telling, direction, cinematography is amazing.. brings you to tears and makes you overjoyed at the same time.. just amazing..three thumbs up..(i borrowed another thumb..)..",1341619200,,271,5.9743589743589745
2664643,5,B000J0QIQ6,"A touching film about different types of love.  One is an infatuation by an overweight security guard, who has fallen for a beautiful executive out of his league.  One is elderly man who is haunted by the death of his wife.  And lastly, 2 girls who meet on the internet start a lesbian relationship, only for one to back out.

There is not much dialogue in the film, but the music and mood of the movie flows seamlessly throughout.  A good watch.",1340755200,,446,4.390243902439025
2664644,1,B000J0QIQ6,"This is a quirky, slow movie.  It had extremely little dialogue and little background noise.  I'm sorry but I couldn't finish it and I can't imagine why it got such good ratings from the rest of the reviewers.  This is not for the average person.

***
Obviously some people like this movie.  But I think my last statement sums it up and gives an appropriate caution.  This movie is not for everyone.  It was annoying to watch a movie that has received such uniformly good reviews and find it very unsatisfactory for me.",1334966400,,519,4.516129032258065
2664645,3,B000J0QIQ6,"Several stories of love.  Wanting love; having love; losing love.  Young love; old love; new love.  Very sweet.

I always enjoy a peek into other's lives, especially when they are in far away countries.",1326326400,,202,4.852941176470588
2664646,4,B000J0QIQ6,"I have become a pretty big fan of the Film Movement DVD library of foreign and indie films. As I have gotten more and more comfortable with the almost alwasy steady quality of their releases, I will find out less and less beforehand about a particular movie and take a chance. Such was the case here. I saw it was a Film Movement release and I picked it up. Glad I did.

""Be With Me"" (93 min; origiannly released in Singapore in 2005) is a rather unique film in my opinion. There is little or no dialogue to speak of (literally), and it takes its time to develop. The movie's first 30 min. starts off with several stories developing at once: two HS girls whose close relationship is falling apart, and the story movies forward primarily via texting and to a lesser degree, chatting. Then there is the older guy who has a crush on a woman, and in essence stalks her. In the meantime we catch some glampses of what later turn out to be the main characters, none more so than Theresa Poo Lin Chan, who became deaf and blind at young age, but nevertheless went on to develop (and enjoy) quite a life. She plays herself in the movie. She is surrounded by several other interesting characters (played by actors).

I don't know quite what to make of the early stories that seem unconnected with the Theresa Poo Lin Chan story, and in fact I wonder if the matter wouldn't have been better served by an outright documentary on her, rather than featuring her in a movie that includes her playing herself. But still, once the movie settles in, it truly is very moving to watch. Definitely a movie to watch, but not for anyone in a hurry.",1308614400,,1626,4.398671096345515

8148262,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Put on your seatbelts for an incredible and emotional ride. The story is told with little dialog but beautifully acted. It is a powerful tale of love, longing, and broken hearts struggling against a variety of problems. It is uplifting, touching, and inspiring. This is one that foreign film buffs should not miss.",1469923200,,314,4.943396226415095
8148263,3,B000J0QIQ6,"I don't know what to make of this movie. I'm glad I saw it. It has/had real potential to speak to some of the impermanent and fragile parts of loving - unrequited love, surreptitious love and lifelong love as well as other powerful ideas of accepting life and its challenges...or not. Real possibilities. Unfortunately, it gets bogged down in the middle with one character to the detriment (IMO) of the other very interesting possibilities in the film. I would definitely see it and decide for yourselves.",1445040000,,505,4.883720930232558

8148265,2,B000J0QIQ6,"It's sad that Amazon continues to use Indie Crush.  Any movie that they distribute is badly edited for content and nudity.  This movie may or may not have any value, but professionals paid for and were paid for this production.  With this in mind, their work deserves to have the whole movie shown.  Very simply, if you can't show the entire movie don't show this horrible edited version.  I really don't understand how Amazon can advertise these movies, when they are nothing like the originals.  Clearly its false advertisement, because most of the time the resulting mess is nothing like the original.  This movie was part of my Amazon Prime membership.  Therefore I would expect them to show the entire movie.

8148268,5,B000J0QIQ6,"Easily one of the ten best movies I've ever seen.  Haunting, funny, heartbreaking, inspiring.  You have to watch it at least twice to understand some of the mysteries.  I loved it the first time around, but only after my second viewing did I appreciate the genius at work here.

The acting is superb all around.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  But what really impressed me was the plot, and I'm pretty hard to impress that way.  There are only seven plots in the world, after all.

In this amazing film there are three commingled stories at play, woven together expertly.  The subject matter covers a huge spectrum of human experience, and every love relationship depicted is nuanced and complex.  A man loves his father but has to be tough on him; another man suffers terribly under his father but nurtures a deep loving spirit.  Two teenage girls love each other beyond affection, but also have to face jealousy and rejection.  A man loves his wife so much he can't let her go.  A woman overcomes deafness and blindness and manages to love life itself so much that she brings happiness to countless others.

I don't think I'm giving too much away when I mention that, in the end, each of the characters in the three stories helps ease the pain for someone from one of the other stories even though they are strangers to each other.

I guess this is what makes the movie so inspiring: It's a realistic reminder that despite our own pain and grief in life we can still reach out to a stranger and make their lives better.  It sounds corny, I realize, but you have to see it yourself.",1383955200,4,1585,4.5477031802120145
