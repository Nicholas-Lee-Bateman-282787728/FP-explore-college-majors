1371061,5,B00004Y3WH,"This is the definitive PUNK movie of all time.  Filmed in one of the cities I grew up in (Downey) I remember what it was like back then.  It showed PUNK when it was a threat and people hated you because of the way you looked.  Not like it is today with all the store bought crap that is shoved down our throats today!  With  Wade Walston now in the U.S. BOMBS and the use of REAL punk bands, ""DI, T.S.O.L. & STEVE O'S VANDALS"" this is a true documentary of punk life in the early 80's.  With many of us growing up in broken homes (drunks for parents) this is a must see for any and all who want to know what being a punk meant!  UP DA PUNX!",978134400,9,640,3.876923076923077
1371062,4,B00004Y3WH,"heres why it gets 4 stars....awesome TSOL footage....footage of the VANDALS right b4 they slipped into permanent crappiness....solid proff why FLEA has always sucked, and will always suck...even if we was in FEAR for 10 minutes and the WEIRDOS for 5....the pet rat outacts him the whole flick....did you know keith morris from the CIRCLE JERKS started the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS?...yup they stole it.....the pointless phrase "" guess what??....chickenbutt!"" which pretty much saves the movie and...and....you get to see fake punkers and exploitation in all its cheap lowbudget glory...i was there and it was nothing like this. ever. not even close. but hey its hollywood and its worth pickin up if you love L.A. punk..which was the best punk scene ever....anywhere......",977184000,2,768,5.30327868852459
1371063,5,B00004Y3WH,"This movie is one of my favorites , mostly because it takes me back to the Days when I was a teenager living on the streets in  S.F. and S.C this movie feature's D.I. with Casey, and the Agnew  Brothers , one of the Agnew Brothers left to do Christian Death,  but in this film they do ""Richard Hung Himself"", and T.S.O.L with songs of the Code Blue album (the best T.S.O.L album ever) and Former Germs Bassist Flea who now and for sometime has played in  the Red Hot Chile peppers plays Razzel  , this movies deals with Misunderstandings and Self Aleination from ""normal"" society,
  It shows a Fear many of us have lost the Fear of an Enemy that  could destroy us at any second, the fear in the movie is the cold war, toxic waste covering the earth , genetic mutation and the  never under appreciated Cold Beer, it has some racist aspects to the movie and some homophobia so if you consider yourself PC  you might be offeneded  I put that as a warning because you know  how the world is today if you say something Defamatory the Thought police come ,,, oh I mean the PC police ,, same thing
 Spare a Dollar white collar!! sorry old habits die hard Watch the movie for the when Skinner looks for his shirt and all the wonderful acting",975974400,6,1233,4.285714285714286
1371064,5,B00004Y3WH,"Filmed in the Reagan 80's, Suburbia shows the struggle of ""outcast"" teenagers known as ""The Rejected"" trying to live in a society that has abandoned them.  Clashing with gun toting 'necks, the cops, and long haired ""beautiful people"" is an everyday occurrence for them.  More importantly, this film has awe inspiring live footage of D.I., T.S.O.L., and the original lineup of The Vandals, who play ""The Legend of Pat Brown"" in the film, a punk classic among classics.
Suburbia was filmed here in SoCal, near where I am typing this up (Downey), and the neighborhoods look familiar to anyone who has lived in Norwalk, Bellflower, Lakewood and surrounding cities. Some may recognize the opening shot (where the huge dish is) as Montebello Boulevard, in Montebello.  Some SoCals may even remember the abandoned neighborhoods near the 605 in Norwalk where The Rejected lived, now demolished, the 105 freeway in its place.
This is THE definitve punk flick not to be missed by real punks, and may give some insight as to be a real punk to all the trendy Stink-182 mall punks.  Just the live performances alone justify the cost.  But then again, real punks already have this movie.",973468800,10,1173,4.904040404040404
1371065,5,B00004Y3WH,if you like punk music it is an awsome soundtrack... It is an awsome movie to (for the time period).,973382400,,100,4.05
1371066,5,B00004Y3WH,This movie got me into punk rock when I was a teenager.  I watched it every day for about six months.  A sad movie but cool.  Special appearances  by the Vandals and D.I. (my favorite band in the mid 80's).,968371200,3,206,4.075
1371067,5,B00004Y3WH,"When she directed Wayne's World in 1992, Penelope Spheeriswas already a 10 year film veteran. Her opus immediately preceding Suburbia was the great pUnK rOcK gospel, The Decline of Western Civilization (1981), for which she gained a lasting reputation as a documentarian of American musical culture.

 Unlike every other director in the 80's (except for Repo Man's Alex Cox, who did the original score for Suburbia), Spheeris knew that punk rock was about more than just having goofy hair, wearing a leather jacket, or aping that Billy Idol sneer. Instead of hoping for a credible performance from actors, she cast real punk rock kids, some of whom were really homeless! Her ensemble of non-actors turned out to be lovable, believable, and endearing. They are mostly innocent and unconscious of themselves or the camera, which has prompted the most criticism. We're not used to watching movies in which people don't (or can't) act. But this is the nature of the documentary style! Spheeris did not want acting, she wanted reacting and interacting. The relationships and the people come across as real and involving. Contrary to some claims, these kids do embody the punk rock experience of the 80's. I was there and can attest that the 'scene' in Suburbia was genuine. Best of all, punk rockers were portrayed as real people with the same fears, hopes, and dreams you and I have...

Also, people who criticize the production quality of Suburbia are missing the point entirely. Everything was shot on location in the ""wrong"" part of the Los Angeles suburbs, using mostly available light and sound. The script was thin, the acting non-existent, and the budget was obviously close to that of Kevin Smith's Clerks. But the whole of Suburbia is infinitely greater than the sum of its parts.

 There are several great musical sequences in Suburbia, including live performances by The Vandals, TSOL, and D.I. Look for Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea, who went on to do another 2 dozen film & TV roles.

 A nod goes to Roger Corman, who co-produced Suburbia. This man has averaged 6.2 movies a year since 1954! He is the undisputed king of cheap cinema and has churned out some of our most beloved pulp celluloid! Thank you Roger, for trusting your instincts and fronting the cash for one of my favorite flicks!",967507200,76,2307,4.9

1371165,5,B00004Y3WH,"I grew up watching this movie a long long long time ago when it first came out in the movie theater, I rememebr watching it at the Pacific theater on Hollywood blvd, I think. Anyway it's great that it's on DVD now. The picture quality is really good but the commentary sucks a bit. Penelope seems she's not sure what she's seeing or even talking about? It would be great to have the other ""punks"" comment on it or even some kind of ""special reunion"" mini-documentary on the ""TR kids"" but no, nothing. Or what ever happened to Ethan that little punk kid on the Big Wheel. There is a commentary by one of the girls but it wasn't Maggie Ehrig or the other punk girl.
I grew up in L.A in the 70s and 80s and the movie is accurate but NOT 100% accurate on the L.A. punk life. What I mean is that in 1983 it was a time that the second wave of L.A. punk scene was already dying and devolving into something else. During those times there were also other L.A. gangs (both Latinos, cholos and whites I.E. Stoners, metal heads) with their own lifestyle, philosophy, and fashion statements that clashed with the punks but this movie doesn't seem to indicate that. It was just rednecks against the punks ..or the police against the punks or the ""regular normal"" people agaainst the punks. But nowhere in this movie shows a fight with any latino gang bangers, the hippie long haired crowd, skinheads or even from other punk gangs?! Or riding on the RTD bus and being harrassed because you had green hair or challenged to a fight with another gang member from a different gang! I remember punks never sitting in the back of the bus unless they want to get their behind kicked! Being lectured in junior high school by the teachers because you had spiky hair and wearing a ripped Black Flag t-shirt.. Yes growing up as a punk in L.A was dangerous and at times you would have to come across other gang members that didn't like your look or clothes and a fight would ensue. That's why it was never a cool idea to walk alone in L.A. as a punk especially in other gang territories.

A young Flea, from The Chili Peppers is one of the main characters, and doesn't disappoint as a young punk-rocker, full of dirt, ideals, and disrespect for authority, along with an affinity for stray rats & rabid dogs.

With a nice touch of abandoned dogs gone wild on the outskirts of a big city, Suburbia is a candid movie, honest to the core, about US belated punk generation, vaguely akin if still indebted to its UK predecessors. Sadly, it was Amerika's last dissent generation, the last one to have the guts before this breed of new conservatism took over completely. Watching this movie, one cannot but raise his hat as the last brave ship of fools sinks. Beautiful. Together with Repoman (a far more sophisticated and entertaining movie from the same period, which also echoes US punk angst), Suburbia is a memento of the USA I used to love.

Ironically, both movies are owned by two major American studios which today would never ever risk financing anything even remotely as quirky and uncompromising.

P.S. - As far as I know, Suburbia is from 1984, not 1982 as stated by Amazon.com.",1151193600,2,1057,4.733695652173913

The kids band together and call themselves The Rejected which for some of kids is actually true. The Rejected find themselves in the sight of the local townsfolk(militia?)who see them as being a terror to their neighborhoods which to give them credit is half true.

I don't remember seeing this in the 80's, and honestly, I grabbed it off the shelf by accident (I was thinking of a movie I wanted called Crime & Punishment in Suburbia) but after watching it, I was certainly happy I'd made a mistake. Suburbia is about a group of teens who are rejected from their homes for various reasons, and our main character has an alcoholic mom who can barely take care of him or his younger brother so he leaves to try to lighten her load and winds up running around with other forgotten youths who call themselves The Rejected, or T.R. for short. It's not a happy-ending tidy kind of film, so don't think this is some shiny happy people living in suburbia thing. It's not, but it shows us a different perspective and aspect of life. The kids have learned how to adapt to survive, living in abandoned homes that have long been forgotten about and getting their groceries in a way most of us would never imagine (which is one of my favorite parts and I'll say no more as not to spoil it). Great live punk performances and and interesting story really hold Suburbia up. The acting seems a little amateur in parts but to me can be easily overlooked. Great movie, and my only complaint is the transfer. It's crappy, to be polite, though there's a different word I'd rather use to describe it.

Sure, the acting is a little rough, but for all the right reasons.  What just blows me away, twenty years later, is what a powerful social document this proves to be -- of Southern California's suburban wasteland, of the economic changes wrought when the manufacturing and military jobs dried up, of the profound alienation that separated us from the Boomers who thought their rebellion might actually accomplish something.

It's also a fascinating look at a punk scene that was far more diverse, far more multi-layered, than the prepackaged product that masquerades as punk today.  The bolo string ties and little black hats in among the skinheads, finheads, and multicolored hair give testament to an inclusive, energetic scene that included elements of country, funnypunk, ska, and hardcore before it shattered into the million shards that the ""scene"" eventually became.  Heaven help the ""punk"" who shows up at a club with a bolo tie today!

This movie, though flawed in all the ways that other reviewers have noted, has a heart that beats true to a time and place that has not been captured anywhere NEAR as well anyplace else on film.

1371184,4,B00004Y3WH,"Suburbia was filmed in Norwalk, California in homes that were

appropriated by the state under the imminent domain laws to make way

for the 105 freeway.

After everyone was moved out the town became derelict for over 10 years as the

city, the state, the feds, and the developer/contractors wrangled over every detail.

It was during this time from the 70s to the 80s that squatters (homeless) could

live in a house for free.  This is were the film takes place.

The denizens of the town were mostly young folk looking for shelter and community.

The 105 fwy now streches from Norwalk at the 605 fwy, past LAX to the Pacific Ocean.

Some of my buddies lived in Norwalk on a tract consisting of well

tended lawns of ""California Ranch"" style homes.

Economic hardships and Reganomics caused something to break in an already

stressed America that ripped families asunder.  It was every man for himself.

I don't think we have recovered from that and wonder if we ever will.

Greed is good?  For whom?

It was a great neighborhood where the actors in the film could

have been born.  The inhabitants that lived there were beautiful,

sporting tans from daily treks to the nearby beaches.

The decay of the times showed in what was left of the community

and its children.  It became a ghost town visible to the left as

we drove south to Huntington Beach.

You could catch glimpses of folks with their hopes and dreams

dancing in the bright sunlight as you flew down the 605.

The mirage would fade away as the graffiti strewn landscape came

into focus.  You would smile at what looked like a giant art

project sponsored by hundreds of artists.

Miles of abandoned streets with houses painted a la Jackson Polock.

Not a soul in sight.  Haunting.

The potential of the times was exciting.  We could have done something more.

The pendulum started swinging backwards towards the dark ages.

Eventually it will move towards times of enlightenment as history has bourne out.

1371187,5,B00004Y3WH,"""Suburbia"" is a rather interesting film that paints a much different perspective on the life of street punks who are often branded as `major undesirables' and how the central characters often are at major odds with the `normal' suburban establishments.

 The story begins with a very disturbing scene involving stray dogs but then cuts to the story of a highly disillusioned adolescent named Ethan whose life is utter hell with his unpleasant mother (who's become a very angry alcoholic) who runs away from home in search of a better life. Later he is taken in and becomes a part of a large gang of rowdy punk rockers. Later in the movie we see a whole barrage of scenes of the lifestyles of the punk rockers in their `alternate' lifestyle in a run down home.

 At first the movie seems to be directed at a more of a `trailer trash' society but at the same time, it is actually a much more socially-conscious insight into the broken home lifestyle and also questions the way that the authoritarian side of normal society (police, politicians, businessmen, and a large sector of the normal people) treats the youth and what causes the gang act the way they do but also the wild behavior of these individuals. The `normal' side of the movie showcases them as `dangerous to society' and need to be dealt with by any means necessary yet the `alternate' part of the movie showcases the `normal' society as repressive towards the different lifestyle of the gang and how that the cultures between them and the establishment can barely even coexist without major confrontations.

 My take on this I could not write in stone. I first saw this movie in a social problems class so I couldn't help but want to write my side on this. I sometimes think that both sides are victims as well as perpetrators of the problems of the community. The victims are the people whove been harmed or worse, lost their lives. The `normal' side of society seems more victimized by the vandalism by the gang who spray offensive graffiti on the store walls and on buildings yet the punk rockers themselves seem to be victims of the repressions of the authoritarian nature of the established society by being threatened with being evicted from their dilapidated home due to the increasing property value and while the neighborhood that they live in is rather tired, the increasing property value is viewed by them as an assault on their livelihood by the `rich folks'. That's my interpretation.

 This is a very interesting movie and am very glad to have stumbled upon it. It has a very unique kind of appeal to it in the way it shows the varying perspectives of the many characters. In ways, some of the `anti-punks' who are a pair of middle-aged trailer trash men commit worse acts than what the punks did. The ending is rather suprising and kind of depressing yet it is so sudden that it dilutes the emotional quality.

 The movie, as good as it is, was not very well made. Yes, the movie is very good for a cheap low-budget movie but the scenes are a bit blurry and the sound quality is also muffled. The acting is also quite campy but it's interesting how a lot of the actors and actresses never acting an any movies since this time.

 The DVD itself offers NO improvement on the old VHS release from the early 1980s. The biggest disappointment is that the picture and sound quality are utterly ATROCIOUS and makes the movie look much older than it really is. Sure movies from around 1984 may have a rather gritty appearance in their original look but ""Suburbia"" suffers immensely from the really gritty picture quality especially during nighttime scenes. The sound quality is also a bit muffled. Compared to some special editions of lets say ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""The Godfather DVD Collection"" which the new versions sounds like a heavy towel is lifted off the television speakers, this one sounds garbled and the combination results in a movie that looks and sounds dated as hell.

 Other than the ancient sound and look of the film, ""Suburbia"" is a really good but very obscure little treasure that may not be picked up by most people's radars. For those who do find it especially those who are strongly into the punk rock culture (which I'm not that much into) will find this to have a strange appeal but even I find this little movie to have its strange appeal in a strange way. A Mildly recommended movie.",1109289600,2,4387,4.643870967741935
1371188,3,B00004Y3WH,"Disinfected youth...er, I mean disaffected youth...for each generation there seems to be a film out there to relate the rebellious, discontented, estranged, insurgent, anarchistic elements within said generation...the 50's presented us with Marlon Brando as The Wild One, the 60's came forth with Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in Easy Rider, the 70's brought us Roller Boogie with Linda Blair (okay, maybe that's not the best example, but then the 70's were pretty lame), and the 80's brought Suburbia (1984)...written and directed by Penelope Spheeris (The Decline of Western Civilization, Wayne's World), the film stars Chris Pedersen (Night of the Comet), along with a bunch of people you've probably never heard of who's only acting credit is this film (Spheeris used a lot of `real life kids' instead of actors, assumingly to present the story as realistically as possible).  There's one other notable person appearing in that of a very young Flea (a wee flea?  I know, I know, that's pretty lame), from the band The Red Hot Chili Peppers, credited as Mike B. The Flea (his real name is Michael Peter Balzary).

The film begins with a pretty shocking scene that seems to have little to do with anything (later we'll see it's sort of a metaphor, as there's quite a few throughout), and then cuts into a scene of a teenage boy named Evan difficulties within his home life that lead to him running away (moms is an angry drunk), wandering the streets of L.A.  Evan soon falls in with a group of homeless teens who call themselves T.R., short for The Rejected, lead by Jack Diddley (Pedersen), at least he appears to be the leader as he seems the oldest and the only one with a car.  The teens live among a condemned series of houses, and survive by begging or stealing what they need from residents in nearby populated neighborhoods (here's a tip if you live in L.A. near the airport...keep your garage door closed, as an open door is an invitation to roving gangs to come in and take whatever isn't nailed down).  The tax-paying residents, who are feeling the frustrations stemming from the effects of Reaganomics (various plants have closed down, forcing many out of work), are growing increasing angry at the kids and their antics, and also at the police for their ineffectual manner in dealing with the situation (the residents do have a valid argument in this, as the police in this film really don't seem to do much of anything).  As a result, the more redneck elements of the residents decide to take matters into their own hands, trying to scare off the homeless kids with forceful tactics, with pretty predictable consequences (i.e. someone gets killed).

This isn't a happy film...there are a few funny moments, but there's an overall nihilistic sense to the story.  As the movie progresses, we get some insight on where the kids come from, the circumstances that led them to where they're at now, along with the antagonistic attitudes they must face on a daily basis of a society that doesn't want them, and doesn't know how to deal with them.  They don't appear to be bad, as they formed their own little family unit, relying on each other for some basic needs, but more products of circumstances out of their control, left to their own devices, surviving anyway they can (much like the wild dogs that roam the area where the kids live)...the style of direction matches the attitude of the material on the screen very well, appearing very raw, unfocused, lacking the polish one would normally see theatrical release.  As I said, many of those appearing are not professional actors, so the performances may appear amateurish, but I think that's the intent.  The dialogue is pretty simplistic, but then this also serves to further highlight the pragmatic nature of the story.  There's no candy coating interpretations, no buffoonish characterizations, only a raw, warts and all, glimpse into a world many of us would probably not have had a chance to experience.  I've read some opinions that state you really need to be a fan of punk rock (there's some great performances by bands like T.S.O.L., The Vandals, and D.I.) to appreciate this film, and while I think it would really help, I don't necessarily agree with the exclusivity of those sentiments (I was actually indoctrinated to punk music back in the late 80's when I found a Dead Kennedy's cassette for sale at a used record shop).  I think most all can enjoy a good film, especially one that offers viewers a chance to understand a segment of the population that appears so completely foreign.  You may not gain any real insight, or even develop a liking where there might have originally been a disliking (people often despise what they don't understand), but I think one can appreciate, at the very least, the effort to give a voice to those who few would listen to otherwise.

I really wanted to give this release 4 stars, but the picture quality, presented in full screen (it states `digitally remastered' on the case), pan and scan format looks pretty rough, much like that of a VHS tape.  It would have been nice if someone had sprung to clean it up a bit, and release it in the original aspect ratio, but this is a Roger Corman release, and he seems not so inclined to spend any more than necessary than he has to (cheap b@stard)...the DVD does contain a few interesting special features, including a commentary track by writer/director Spheeris, along with brief biographies of Corman, Spheeris, and Pedersen, original and alternate theatrical trailers (the film was originally titled Rebel Streets), and some trailers for other Corman releases including one for Saint Jack (1979) and Piranha (1978).  If you liked this film, check out a movie called Over the Edge (1979), featuring Matt Dillon in his first, feature role, not yet on DVD.

1371189,5,B00004Y3WH,"A friend had told me about this movie, and so I rented it one day. To my delight (ew), I found a really awesome movie to watch over and over. It's the kind of movie that has unintentionally funny parts, for instance, the opening scene. I don't want to give much away, but let's just say that something tragic happens, but the effects are so low-budget,  it is laughable. But that doesn't lessen the quality of this film. The movie is about a teenage boy named Ethan, who runs away from his abusive, alcoholic mother and younger brother . He has nowhere to go, and then he follows some kids he sees to a punk rock show, and then befriends a older kid named Jack. He takes Ethan to the squat him and his friends live in called the TR house (TR stands for ""The Rejected"") . There all the kids who didn't belong anywhere else or had no where else to go stay, and become the only family they will ever really know or want.  They are so dedicated to each other, they brand the TR logo on their flesh like cattle. Now that's Punk Rawk!!! The transformation of Ethan, and then his little brother, whom Ethan later takes away from his mom after she gets arrested, is amazing. Just the image of not even a ten year old boy on a big wheel with a mowhawk and an army jacket is to me breathtaking.  Also look out for Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame) as one of the kids living in the TR house.

Most of the movie is about how these kids couldn't get along well in their own houses, but together they can survive. And the cops understand their ways more than the townspeople do in this movie.  It's a pretty cliche story plot, but it still works as an original movie.

Penelope Spheeris has always been a big name director in the punk and metal scene. She directed all the Decline of Western Civilization movies, and even the Wayne's World pics. She knows how to film punk rock shows. In this movie, when the bands (TSOL, Vandals, et.c) play, she knows how to capture the flow of the crowd.  And people might say the acting in this movie is bad. But just keep in mind that Penelope had real punk rock kids in this movie. So they were not actors playing punks, they were punks being actors!

The best way to see this movie is the DVD version, with widescreen. The commentary with Penelope Spheeris is good. She reveals a bit of secrets from the set. Did you know that the kids really did sleep and live at the TR house during filming?

Oh, and one thing to check in the movie that they do not reveal in the commentary, which I hoped they would.  In one scene,  the actor playing Jack calls Flea by his his real name; not his characters' name!

Enjoy watching Suburbia! Don't compare this movie to SLC Punk. At least these kids were real punks! You should watch this movie with the Decline of Western Civiization!",1104451200,5,2800,4.292220113851992

1371191,4,B00004Y3WH,"In truth, I can only really reccomend this movie to real fans of punk rock or Penelope Spheeris (""The Decline of Western Civilization"", etc.). Others may not understand it so well. If you like punk rock, you'll have fun with this - the concert scenes are a HUGE bonus. It is a nice little ""coming of age"" tale, though, and is, dare I say, heartwarming in some scenes.

The movie ""SLC Punk"" (1999) borrows a lot from this movie but is a lot better made. They are interesting to compare, and you could make a nice punk rock movie night out of the two titles. I'm not saying one is better than the other, just try comparing them. Oh, and they both have phenomenal soundtracks (again, if you like punk, try them, they have a lot of classics on them).

I have had this movie for several years now on VHS - I got it for Christmas when I was younger from my Dad. My friend told me about it, and I was really excited to see it because it was supposed to depict life in the early 80's for a group of punks in California. I, being the little rebellious punk girl trying to relive the 80's LOVED the movie despite its many flaws.

The movie starts by focusing on Ethan and his life in a broken-home. After he runs away he is taken in by a group of rowdy punk rockers at their ""suburban-hell"" squatter house which is in an abandoned neighborhood. They treat Ethan well and respect him, and soon he brings his younger brother to live with the group so he can have a life away from the chaos their alcoholic mother creats. Then the movie begins to focus on the group as a whole and a new girl who arrives and falls in love with one of the group's members. T.R. (""The Rejected"") begin having conflict with the local ""law enforcement"" and citizens because they believe T.R. is dangerous. You'll have to see the movie to find out how it ends.

Some scenes are very funny (Such as harassing the local yocals at the market - ""Happy Easter!"" and asking a housewife at a garage sale if she's ""got any vibrators?"" - the look on her face is PRICELESS!), touching, and sad (I cried at a few points), and look out for a young Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers as a member of the gang. Like I said, the concert scenes are a DEFINATE PLUS - D.I. perform ""Richard Hung Himself"", T.S.O.L. perform ""Darker My Love"", and the early Vandals play ""Pat Brown"" in a very humorous live set.

To be honest, though, it is not well made, does not stand the test of time, and the acting leaves a lot to be desired, and also some of the things seem very unbelievable and outrageous today, but it has a special place in my heart because this is a movie that I grew up with in the punk rock scene. I gave it four stars because, if you are a fan of punk rock, you will enjoy this movie even with it's campy acting. It's fun.",1093219200,5,2782,4.2120075046904315

This movie depicts a story of kids in the LA area in the early 80's, who due to family problems end up running away and becoming punks. These characters are ""rescued"" in different ways by a group of punk kids called ""TR""-""the rejected""..they live in a house in the middle of an abandoned suburban neighborhood ""out by the 605"" freeway in Downey, CA (which is actually a predominantly latino community in real life)..these kids are punks with spiked hair, leather jackets, ripped army surplus clothes and run down cars with the names of punk bands spray painted on them...in other words, they don't look like others. They're opposed by local ""redneck"" type adults who seem to have it out for the TR kids, until a showdown..in between are various concert performances from 80's LA punk bands DI, the Vandals, and tsol...a very young Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers is in the movie as Razzle, a kid who shoots cockroaches with his slingshot and loves his pet rat. Also in the movie is Chris Petersen as Jack, one of the main characters, and an actor who's only other role was a small part in Oliver Stone's Platoon
I will say that this film is not entirely realistic...it's a somewhat ""punk rock romanticized"" version of LA. Southern Cal in this movie is seen as this place where wild dogs run around like coyotes and people sit by bonfires at night..as if LA in the early 80's was some sort of wild west frontier. Also, anyone in this movie who's not a punk rocker has no fashion whatsoever...all the non punks in the film wear random polo shirts and slacks from the discount section of Mervyn's. There's no breakdancers, pop lockers, mods, low riders, or any other style of person to compete with the punk lifestyle (styles that actually were around in real life in LA at the time)-it's either punks or t.v audience-looking ""maniquins""...in a way, it's a teenager's view of the world, there's me and my group, and then there's everyone else.
However, Suburbia shows the value of being a friend to others, and shows the problems of prejudice and dysfunctional families, which is somewhat the moral of the film..It's not 100% realistic as some feel, but it will show Penelope Sheris's vision of 80's punk culture-- before it was turned into the ""MTV Jackass/Blink 182"" ""corporate version"" of punk that exists now",1083715200,14,2572,4.642543859649122

1371195,4,B00004Y3WH,"This was a GREAT flick!!! Especially if you had been part of the punk craze in the 80's. Penelope Sphreeris' first film (I think) she wrote and directed this roger corman project and also appearances by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Chris Pedersen who didn't do many roles at all, but also had a cameo in Platoon as well as a few other movies. The music was mostly by the Vandals (great stuff!) and the soundtrack music was credited as being by Alex Gibson, but you can hear Fleas unmistakable bass line in the music. Deadpan funny in spots, sad and ironic in places it roughly captures the feeling and energy of the 80's punk phenominon. A must have for punk fans!",1079222400,2,676,4.416
1371196,4,B00004Y3WH,"Sad fact people: this is the most punk rock movie that will EVER be made.  Y'see, as bad as this film was, y'know, the bad acting, the horrible dialogue, the predictable plot, the fact that it was so bad makes it punk!  *LOL*  A total DIY independent movie which shows punk as it was in the early 80s in Los Angeles. (Although one fellow viewer once mentioned that if a show at that time in that place was ever shut down because some chick got her clothes ripped off, there would have been a riot...probably true!) The actors were all amatuers, and most likely they were all real punks and/or street kids with absolutely NO film experience to speak of, and the director did little or nothing before this film.  So, why four stars if it was so crappy?  Because of what the film was about!  Predictability aside, this movie captures the essence of Punk.  Not just ""punk rock"" mind you.  If you're just lookin' for the ""rock"" part of punk, go throw on a Blink 182 or Sum 41 (whats with the numbers by the way?) album, 'cause thats as close as you're gonna get!  Punk was, is, and always will be a way of life.  The scene may be all but dead in this country right now, (thanks to the afore-mentioned bands killing the very essense of the the movement) but to those who understand what it is and why it was will always follow it.  Its not a philosophy, its a way of life.  And it can't be explained on paper, or even in film for that matter.  It has to be experienced...wether you're a poor kid from nothing, kickikng ass in the pit, or a suburban brat, sick of everyone's B.S. around you and just hoping you find something better to connect with, Punk is a way of life that speaks louder than the music it comes with!  This movie, along with some of the British and American documentaries, is the closest thing I've ever seen to capturing that feeling of what we've decided to call Punk.  The characters, what little we know about them, they're music, the people who are against them, and the fact that they only have each other, and aren't willing to give that up for nothing, are the very things that has kept the Punk scene alive all these years, despite the so-called ""posers,"" etc., butting they're ugly lil heads in trying to claim it as they're own.  Wether you're a punk, or a skinhead, or even, since the 90s anyway, a goth, hardcore kid, grunge-type druggie person (you know what i mean!), if you get this movie, then chances are you don't need some silly review to help you undertstand why this film was so important.

as for the director's commentary, i can only describe it this way:
a. about 15 minutes into the ""commentary"", i was convinced she did not direct this film, nor had she ever even seen it before.
b. to the producers of this dvd: if you are going to have a director's commentary, please make sure the director has watched the film in the last 18 years. half of the total commentary was, ""wow, i remember that"" - not in a convincing way either.
c. i felt like a blind man sitting through the film with someone describing to me what they were seeing or sitting in a theatre and having to listen to the jerk in the seat in front of me give their stupid and obvious observations about the plot line. the plot was pretty easy to follow, i didn't need the commentary telling me ""now these two guys are fighting"" as i watch two guys fighting.
d. if i ever hear the line ""back then , that's what punk rockers were like"" one more time, i will savagely attack the nearest person most likely to not fight back.
e. there would be complete silence for a few minutes, then she would laugh very loudly for a few seconds and then remain completely silent again for a few minutes, without commenting on what was so funny. there were plenty of times during this that i wanted the actors dialog to be louder so i didn't feel like i was watching it with the volume off.",1071532800,13,1552,4.254237288135593

Being a suberban punk, after watching this movie helped me realize what a hard life really was. There is such a strong sense of unity throughout the whole movie between characters, nothing seems staged its all real and easy to relate to.
  The plot is strong throughout the whole movie. Great apperances by D.I. and TSOL. The story fallows a group of friends just trying to survive in Suberbia. Through Garage hopping, fights, shows, rough times and death this group of Totally Rejected kids stick together, share everything they have and show what true punk is all about. This film is a must see for everyone a punker or not. It reasures punk kids that they are apart of something bigger, and shows what real friends, unity and loyalty is all about.

Well to say the least that first night I don't think any of us heard more then ten lines from the entire movie because of all the laughter from the audience this movie was suppose to be depicting.

Granted, the acting is terrible, but not only is it beside the point, hardly any of the kids in it had acting experience. My hat is off to Penelope Spheeris for doing a great job of depicting suburban America and a quite realistic depiction of the struggle to become an individual in a society that, to this day favors conformity over individuality. It shows how self-righteous and ignorant parents can be of their own children's pain and isolation, even though usually they caused it themselves.
If you have yet to see this movie, be aware that the end will catch you off guard. If you watch this with children, be prepared to do a lot of explaining and listening.
This is one of those movies that deserves to be on DVD, and will hopefully be continued on whatever formats are to come.

movies I have ever seen. This movie is one of the only movies out there that really and truly captures the origional Idea of the punk rock scen. I think one of the things that makes it really geat is the fact that it shows (realisticly) some of the every-day problems that kids experience growing up, which were, and (in some cases) still are integral to the punk rock scen and its audience.

For the rest of us this movie was a right of passage. Realistically depicting the youth of the 80's Reagan era punk scene in the suburbs of LA. Possibly one of the most depressing and realistic films dealing with the punk scene while SLC PUnk was just cheesy punksploitation ...this film bleeds the alienation and rebellion..the ostracism..and the violence surrounding them as the holier than thou locals hate the kids just for being different.

1371207,4,B00004Y3WH,"Me and my sister were in love with Suburbia when we saw it in the mid 80's.  We grew up in NY, but we felt for some reason as though we belonged in California.  It's great to see Suburbia again after all these years with commentary by director Penelope Spheeris to boot.
Penelope Spheeris used real kids as opposed to seasoned actors.  As a result, the movie has a genuine punk rock vibe, although the acting is nothing to write home about.  Listening to the director's commentary, one learns the ins and outs of how and why certain aspects of the film occur.  She took a lot of events taking place at that time and incorporated them into the script, such as the wild dogs in the beginning of the movie.  One thing that I am kinda bummed out about is how she seems to be a bit embarassed by the movie.  She almost makes excuses at times.  Yes, the scene in which the two men shoot the wild dogs is a bit hard to stomach and we all know that that type of scene would never make it into a movie today.  But that is one of the aspects that I love about Suburbia.  It's a low budget, honest, straight out of the 80's movie.  Penelope Spheeris should be 100% proud of it.
The music and live concert footage is great.  D.I. and TSOL, to name a couple, provide a great soundtrack.

1371208,5,B00004Y3WH,"What this film does so well that most punk rock films cannot seem to accomplish is to give real insight into why the punk movement happened...why it HAD TO happen.  This is a film that UNDERSTANDS alienation, and why kids who were intelligent enough to see past the lies they'd been fed and the distractions intended to placate them felt so disenfranchised.  We see kids who've come from broken homes...whose parents don't understand the world their kids are living in...who are, in essence, The Rejected.  Conventional society rejects them...so they, in turn, reject conventional society.  As a punk rocker, this film has always struck a chord with me because of that very reason.  What do you do, after all, when you realize that your parents are full of (...)?  When you realize that your teachers are full of (...)?  What do you do then?  What CAN you do?  This film relates the story of a group of young people who became easy scapegoats in their community.  When something goes wrong, it's easy to blame the outsiders, isn't it?  It's so easy to point the finger at people who already DON'T FIT.  That is what this film portrays so honestly, and so plainly.  True, the acting is sub-par...but who cares?  This film's insight is enough to carry it.  And there are beautiful moments throughout, mainly fueled by Flea's performance as Razzle.  I can't count the times I've uttered the immortal line ""Happy Easter, ***hole"" in various convenience stores across the Midwest.  And the scene in which Chris Pederson says ""Where's that house, Flea?"" and Flea responds to the question...then adds, about thirty seconds later, ""Hey, my name's Razzle, man"" is priceless.  This film was not afraid to show off, even PARADE, its flaws.  And what makes it so perfect, so real, was Penelope Spheeris's use of real punk rock kids in this film, as opposed to actual ACTORS.  She sums it up best in her own personal philosphy...""It's easier to teach punks to be actors than it is to teach actors to be punks.""",1008892800,3,1997,4.766763848396502

The direction, writing, and acting are beyond atrocious (The RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS' Flea... then known as ""Mike B."" makes a cameo, proving he should never quit his day job as a whiteboy funk bass player), yet this film holds a certain charm... especially for young punk kids who seem to memorize every line of insipid dialogue. Check out the excellent live footage of D.I., T.S.O.L., and THE VANDALS. Classic stuff.

I would also suggest anyone pursuing a degree and/or career in sociology watch this film, as it represents an important part of our society - much better than any college textbook ever has.

I have never seen a more realistic depiction of the struggle to become your own person in a society that obviously favors conformity over individuality.  The kids in this film, like my friends and I in the 80's, are what ""normal"" society can't stand, and they are ostracized for it.  They try to find their own way, but growing up is never easy, especially when you live on the streets.
I wholeheartedly agree with my fellow reviewers that the acting is terrible and the lighting is bad, but that's beside the point here.  This movie rises far above such superficial trappings by cutting right to the bone of suburban America.  The parents in the film (like many I've met in real life) are self-righteous and completely ignorant of their own children's pain and isolation, most of which was caused by the parents themselves.
""Suburbia"" is a movie that is both funny and disturbing, although ultimately sad - the ending caught me completely by surprise.  Rare is the movie that leaves you speechless when it ends, this one will do just that.

What I do know is that this movie attempts to portray the punks as innately criminal, savage and often unintelligent. I don't know what pool of kids were modeled to get what they got, but the punks that I knew were not this way at all. Yes they were crude and loud, but they didn't care what others thought because they were happy being themselves, not off being sad or angry. My message to Penelope would be that just because the punks are from LA, doesn't mean that they all act like the lead singer of FEAR. It's not punk rock to be a criminal, or to have a colorful hair style or spikes or rips in your clothes. It's punk rock to elevate your mind and to challenge the mainstream idea of what life should or could be. Why? Because the mainstream is bought and paid for. In the West, it's used to increase market activity and condense power, by changing fads and convincing people that they aren't good enough without keeping up. Both Edward Bernays and the Tavistock Institute of human relations are worth looking into if you want more info on those topics. Anyway, off topic and all, I think this film tried too hard to make punks look like the willing dregs of society. Punks try to get by without becoming the thing that they are rebelling against, and that's living a lot better than many people do today.
