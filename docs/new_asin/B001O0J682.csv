8328578,2,B001O0J682,"This video shows Mika Immonen kicking butt on the pool table, he doesn't even stop and talk to you or show you what he's doing. There's a narrator in the background teaching you what each kind of shot is, they show two examples of what the shot is and then quickly move onto the next chapter. You end up feeling like you suck even more due to the fact that you don't feel like you know enough or seen better examples of what they are talking about. The videos motion graphics and sounds are way better then the examples they show.

I'd say this video is more like a teaser, hey here is what we do and this is what it's called, good luck! For $30 it's a rip off. Find a better video where they show you more examples etc.",1285027200,8,720,4.1063829787234045

8328580,5,B001O0J682,"I'm not sure what the guy who gave this a bad review was talking about. This is not a practice DVD.....it's an instructional DVD.  Two completely different things, as one is for learning to play, while the other one is for maintaining your existing game. Clearly he already knew how to play well.

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned this video is the ideal crash course for any casual or league players. It's probably the best instructional video on the market, and also the best in the series. 5 stars from me.",1243900800,2,508,4.510869565217392
8328581,2,B001O0J682,"I bought this video thinking that it would give me some good practice ideas to improve my game.  It doesn't do anything but show you what certain shots are called.  The only good thing is the table runs he does at the end and that's only because you get an idea of how a pro runs the rack.  Other than that, it was useless.  Get Varner's DVD;s on how to practice pool to improve.",1238630400,3,379,4.081081081081081
