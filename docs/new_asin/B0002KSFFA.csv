8028684,5,B0002KSFFA,"This is one of the best if not the most authentic prison documentary i've seen. Consisting mainly of ex-cons and former c.o's recounting their day to day lives as well as some of their wildest memories behind bars, they make it clear that jail is someplace you don't want to be. So much more than just talking heads though, director Troy Reed has made a shocking yet entertaining look at life on New York's Rikers Island and the realities of life on the inside. There is no sugar-coating here, this is the real deal, especially since it features interviews with many well known ""Street Legends"" from New York including the only filmed interview with Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff, former Queens, New York drug kingpin, before he was sent back to prison where he is now serving a life sentence. While there though he gave his only other interviews to respected prison author/journalist Seth Ferranti while they bidded together, and Seth wrote books based on them. Check his products out below, if you liked this movie you'll love Seth's books:

8028685,5,B0002KSFFA,I had seen the movie before.  I couldn't ask for a speedier delivery or better service!,1217548800,,87,4.4375
8028686,5,B0002KSFFA,This is the first DVD I've seen that travels to Africa and back with an eye towards the modern day slavery being practiced in America's prison systems.  Great documentary that gets you closer to the streets than formal documentaries could.  Troy Reed does it again!,1192924800,,265,4.866666666666666
8028687,5,B0002KSFFA,"Well a former Riker's Island Corrections Officer came to my school to talk to us at an assembly. He showed us this DVD and then a slideshow he put together that was based on photos he took himself of what he personally saw at Rikers Island. He was also an 83' alumni from my school, but I digress. Okay, let's start off with this film. It is very graphic. I would not recommend it to those who are faint of heart. If however, you aren't squeamish, I would definitely recommend this film to you. it separates the truth from the fantasy. Did you know that you could get a new case charge just for defending yourself in prison? (Which you'll have no choice but to do) Or that even though you're affiliated with a certain gang, once you're in prison you'll still have to prove yourself loyal to hang out with gang members of the same gang who don't personally know you? and if you refuse you could easily lose your life? Yeah, it has nothin' to do with being a gangsta because in jail there will always be someone higher than you. Well I really don't want to say anything else because it might spoil the documentary for you. Anyway, I do strongly recommend that you check it  out because you will learn a lot of things you never knew before. I know I did.",1174867200,4,1251,4.3008474576271185
8028688,5,B0002KSFFA,"i loved this documentary. it took me right inside the walls of Rikers Island, and showed how much similarity there is inside those walls and on the slave plantations in Africa.

If you are interested in criminology, urban environment, and in general life in the hood and some of the things that people in the ghetto go through, you will love this film.",1159747200,3,352,4.587301587301587
8028689,1,B0002KSFFA,"I'll start my review by stating that this film was a disappointment for me. The film is marketed in some other Internet sites as an educational film on knife attacks in prison, and how to counter them. In reality, this film is comprised mainly of interviews of ex convicts and former correctional officers who worked in Rikers Island prison. There are some photographs of stabbing victims and some authentic camera footage, but about 90% of the film consists of interviews.

The film concentrates on prison violence and corruption in the late 80's and early 90's. I did not find the subject interesting or topical issue. Anybody knows that there is violence among the prisoners, and anyone can claim that the correctional officers are corrupt. And in any case, the cases handled in the film happened over a decade ago.

Some people might find these interviews interesting, but I did not learn anything of value or of interest from this film.
