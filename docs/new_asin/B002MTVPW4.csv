8374049,5,B002MTVPW4,"I am a teacher who found this DVD while looking for resources to use in my classroom to help students become familiar with the experiences of refugees in our world today. I watched Home Across Lands and found it to be wonderfully informative, accessible and engaging. It conveys the refugee camp experience, as well as the experience for refugees once they arrive in the United States. I think students in middle school and high school classrooms would benefit enormously from watching it in the context of their learning about immigrants and/or refugees. Any parent interested in helping their own children learn more about the topic would also find the DVD helpful.",1260230400,,667,5.018018018018018
8374050,5,B002MTVPW4,"""So often the world sits idly by, watching ethnic conflicts flare up, as if these were mere entertainment rather than human beings whose lives are being destroyed. Shouldn't the existence of even one single refugee be a cause for alarm throughout the world?"" -- Urkhan Alakbarov

This quote from Azerbaijani geneticist Urkhan Alakbarov, paints the picture of how most people in the US deal with the overwhelming challenges of refugees around the world.  Our lives are comfortable and convenient and when we hear a tale of someone else being displaced from their home, forced to flea by foot, and then warehoused in a camp for years on end we can't even imagine how difficult that must be.

Well, finally there is a movie that brings the difficult life of a refugee to the big screen in a thought provoking and heart-felt way.  Home Across Lands is a movie about Kunaamen refugees who have been forced to flea their homes in Eritrea.  They have been housed for years in makeshift dirt encampments in Ethiopia with nothing to do and no hope for moving their lives forward.

Shot on location in Ethiopia the movie has stunning landscapes and incredible cinematography.  The camp interviews are compelling and the refugees journey from the camp to their new lives in Providence, RI is remarkable.

I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is interested in knowing more about the daily life of a refugee and the difficulties of resettling a refugee in a safe home country.  As a teacher, I am eager to share this movie with my students to give them a better idea of what the experience is all about",1256083200,3,1597,4.736462093862816

8374052,5,B002MTVPW4,"This film will stay with you. Despite the heaviness of its subject-- marginalized peoples forced to build a new community first in a refugee camp and then in a new world-- it tells their story with a deft touch that never leaves you feeling hopeless or overwhelmed. To the contrary, if you are anything like me, after viewing this film you will come away feeling hopeful about things, positive about the U.S. and its promise of a new beginning, and of the resourcefulness of humanity when faced with difficulties.

It never devolves into a voyeuristic piece that portrays these folks as anything other than people. They are never shown as victims beyond their circumstances, which are, to be honest, bleak initially, and brings you along for the slow, steady climb to the beginning of their new lives. Also notable is its portrayal of the people assigned to help integrate these folks into American society. Theirs is not an easy job, nor is it in any way exciting. It is hard work, nuts-and-bolts stuff that only committed and resourceful people can do. When they come together with the Kunama in fashioning a new life, it is truly inspirational.",1251158400,,1147,4.822335025380711
