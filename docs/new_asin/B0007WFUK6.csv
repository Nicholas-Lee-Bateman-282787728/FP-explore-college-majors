Great for middle school or high school treat. Discusses the developement of the scientific as well as the political and economic obsticals encountered by the wright brothers. Good review of the methodoligy developed by the Wrights in inventing ""heavier than air"" flight. Great father's day gift.  Great father/son or father/daughter entertainment; if they are techies.
