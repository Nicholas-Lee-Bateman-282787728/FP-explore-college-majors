8283583,4,B001BMN4PE,"A wonderful talk show! It would be so great if people spent their time watching shows like this rather than the crap talk shows we waste our time on today. I actually gained perspective & knowledge, was entertained, and my mind was stimulated. Hopefully someday the major tv networks will play such inspirational & productive material rather than the trash they try to feed us. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem.",1374883200,,427,4.706666666666667
8283584,5,B001BMN4PE,This is an episode of an international talk show dedicated to bringing together the spiritual and physical. Awesome guests and topics. This is the kind of presentation you simply won't see on mainstream tv. The overwhelming message here is about love. I enjoyed it thoroughly.,1374883200,,276,5.155555555555556
8283585,3,B001BMN4PE,"This three hour long DVD is a bit different than what I expected.  What it is, is a talk show series with many interesting guests and topics covered.  I couldn't watch it all in one sitting, but watched one show per day.  Aside from the fact that I didn't have three hours to carve out of my day, I wanted to watch an episode, digest the information I heard and think about it for awhile, perhaps form my own opinions and do some online research into the subject, then move on to the next.

Sure, not every guest's topic will tickle your fancy, but there's definitely something for everyone.  Whether you want to hear about Daniel Pinchbeck and his encounters with a tribe in Gabon, Africa and the experience with iboga (a psychedelic drug), or Mayan prophecies, universal archetypes, or beginning meditations, there's a lot of information to take in. Fascinating!",1274486400,,864,4.695364238410596
8283586,4,B001BMN4PE,"Bridging Heaven and Earth

This is a remarkably down-to-Earth talk-show on spiritual enlightenment, beginning with Daniel Pinchbeck, who describes his Carlos Castaneda-style encounters with the Bwiti tribe of Gabon in Africa, who use a psychedelic called iboga.  Pinchbeck then goes on to speak about encounters with shaman (shamen?) in Latin America.  Among other subjects he discusses his book, ""Breaking Open the Head,"" which sounds fascinating.

Jose Arguellas talks about Mayan prophecy, materialism, Time, and the spiritual World to Come.  (One of the eerie things about him is his uncanny resemblance to Timothy Leary.)

Philip Gardiner illustrates his ideas about universal archetypes with interesting music videos populated with iconic images.

Michael Tamura actually gives a fascinating and effective TV primer on how to begin meditation.

The setting is definitely ""public-access cable"" and you won't get more than a start on deep knowledge here.  I'm sure the question-answer format isn't the best path to mystical knowledge, but like any good talk-show, this DVD does propels you to further reading and watching.  Most of the musical interludes, though entertaining, are a bit of a distraction, and I found myself fast-forwarding through them--not a problem, since this DVD is some 3 hours long.",1272499200,,1309,5.532663316582915
8283587,4,B001BMN4PE,"As a Philip Gardiner fan, I was excited to see him participate in this self-proclaimed ""Spiritual Talk Show"".  It is exactly as described and very interesting.  Only gave it a four because production was simple.  If unity and harmony are on your mind, give this DVD a chance.",1236902400,,275,4.6875
8283588,3,B001BMN4PE,"Bridging Heaven and Earth is a talk show dealing with spirituality in what some people might consider a ""new age"" genre. It is hosted by ""Allan""--no last name--and I was a little put off initially by the cheesy set and overall visual quality, but the guests and discussion are really absorbing once it gets going.",1233705600,,313,4.709090909090909
8283589,4,B001BMN4PE,"Very interesting DVD.  Talks about 2012.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the picture quality is NOT that clear.  They need to re-edit the picture quality of this DVD & reduce the price to $10.00 - $15.00 because of the quality of the video.  FORGOT TO MENTION, I LOVE THE MUSIC FROM TWINFLAME ""PEACEFUL WARRIOR"" ON THIS DVD.",1222473600,,328,4.416666666666667
