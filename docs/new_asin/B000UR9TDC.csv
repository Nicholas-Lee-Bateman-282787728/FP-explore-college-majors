8214465,5,B000UR9TDC,"The DVD was in perfect condition when it arrived, and I was also pleased that the price on Amazon was well below that of local stores. As for the product, the series is wonderful- a humorous twist on teenage crushes, and boasting 5 episodes for a single DVD is quite a bargain in itself.",1202774400,,287,4.333333333333333
8214466,4,B000UR9TDC,"This dvd set contains episodes 6-10 of School Rumble.  This dvd expands  the story further by revealing the characters.  In this volume viewers find out about Harima and what he is aspiring to become and why he is interested in Tenma; in addition to the mysterious Karasuma and who he really is.  Now unto the review!

Pro:
The story is no longer only focusing on Harima and Tenma as other characters are now introduced with a story of their own.  There are several new characters introduced in this volume to help the story progress.  Also, an interesting love confession scene is what helped this dvd volume to receive a 4 star (otherwise I would have given it a 3).

Con:
The repeating theme of love confession between Harima and Tenma can be annoying at times (though it can be funny at times).  Lack of character development for the other characters hurts this dvd volume.

Conclusion:
For those who have been watching since Volume 1, this is a must buy!  Anyone else who is getting into the series for the first or casual viewers are encouraged to buy as well, but understand that there are some things that you will not get (anime parodies are hard to come by when you are watching for the first time)",1196294400,2,1208,4.546296296296297
