8436917,5,B004NYYDWA,"This film gives you a great perspective on Bert while still in his 30's. There are also several bonus songs (3) recorded in Stockholm in 1978, and a bonus documentary, released in 1985 that has some excellent interview footage of Bert that gives very good insight into Bert as a person (not a singer).

The sound was not supposed to be super surround, Hollywood style technology. The sound, though is just fine.

This film is a good contrast to the several films (BBC and other) that show Bert toward the end of his life. It is just wonderful. Bert at his peak.",1328745600,4,561,4.490196078431373
