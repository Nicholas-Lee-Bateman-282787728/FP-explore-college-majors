8325574,5,B000P8ZSAE,"I came across this DVD a couple years ago at Target.  It only cost $2.50 so I said ""why not"".  The workout is divided into 10 minute intervals and you can choose 2 or 3 out of about 6 I believe.  I lost about 10 lbs because I was very dedicated to loosing it.  I would only do 2 10 minute workouts sometimes 3 every other day and ate decent food.  I recommend this dvd...anyone can do 10 minutes!",1280534400,3,396,3.962025316455696
8325575,4,B000P8ZSAE,"Wow! What a bargain, two complete workouts.  The cardboard package isn't great, but I bought this for the (step) workout not the package.  The first workout is Kathy Kaehler Basics - Total Fitness Workout.  7 five minute toning segments: Warm it up, Cardio Blast, Bottoms Up, Arm Sculpting, Hot Legs, Abolutely Ab, and Stretch it out.  Chapters allow you to pick individual workouts.  The second workout is Kathy Kaehler Basics - Workout Class.  3 Step Aerobic Segments: 8 Minute Warm Up, 30 Minute Cardio, and 10 Minute Tone & Stretch.  I recommend this for beginner/low-intermediate.  The step workout has very basic choreography.",1252886400,5,632,5.127450980392157
