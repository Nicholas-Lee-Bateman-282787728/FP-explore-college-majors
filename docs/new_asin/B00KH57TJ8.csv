8658642,5,B00KH57TJ8,"The set of this series is simple, and pointless, and that is it's strength.  I was very surprised, what with the slim number of recent Sentai releases dubbed in English that this one was, but it was a pleasant surprise.
The premise of the show is this:
We are going to follow this girl, Tamako, who is the daughter of a Mocci shop owner.  She loves the stuff.  Her little sister... not so much.  She had two friends, a mono tone speaking girl who is a carpenter, and another who is slightly brash, and infatuated with Tamako.  Across the street is her male friend, who's father owns a rival Mocci shop.  Enter a rude, sarcastic talking bird, looking for a bride for his islander Prince, and all the main components are in place.
With these ingredients, we get a 12 episode peak into what goes on over the course of a year in the shopping arcade community this girl grew up in, and the relationships the neighbors share.  There is never any major drama, and no real point, and when the end hits, there is nothing really different from the start.
The show manages to be funny, heartwarming, and supremely satisfying, taking stereotypes in some places, and surprisingly unusual, and cute little twists that just make up an absolutely charming experience.  The dialogue is fun, the witty jokes are chuckle worthy, the purposefully bad jokes are appropriately cringe worthy, and the problems confronted in the run are appropriately mundane.  The charm is that this show just feels as if you are opening a window into these characters lives, and seeing segment play out in a real feeling way, and every episode had me walking away with a smile.",1413331200,7,1638,4.659722222222222
8658643,5,B00KH57TJ8,"This is sugar in anime form. With a delightful set of characters and Kyoto Animation's flawless production value, Tamako Market really sticks with you and leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling after episode 12 is over. And maybe I'm biased, but to me this series was a lot more than just Kyoani's typical ""Cute girls doing cute things"" genre. It was really something special. And each of the characters was really sweet and memorable. If you are a bit wary of this series, I completely understand. But if you want something light and airy with a big gooey heart at the center, check out this refreshing slice of life. You'll be glad you did, even if it was just for that fat bird alone.",1407369600,11,685,4.488
