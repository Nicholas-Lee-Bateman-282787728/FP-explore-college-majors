He also explains about what the stock market is and what the difference is between stocks and businesses. He also covers what publicly traded companies are, how they get financed and how they get started. He also talks about how to buy a stock for a cheap price and when to sell that stock. I found this DVD, like his others, to be very informative.",1356998400,,468,4.269662921348314
8554886,5,B00ANSPTOQ,This video is a nice introduction to value investing. It lays the ground foundation for what value investing is all about. I really enjoyed the section about how wealth is created. I never really thought about wealth creation in the way that the author describes but it is very useful to have this kind of thinking in your frame of mind.,1355702400,,337,4.540983606557377
8554887,5,B00ANSPTOQ,"This video is a basic introduction to value investing. It does not get too deep into any subject because it is intended to be watched with the other DVDs from the bundle. Some of the topics included in it are building wealth, stocks vs businesses, how companies become public, when to buy stocks, how to value them, and when to sell them. I've been getting interested in value investing lately and reading a lot about it. After everything I've read so far, I just think value investing is the best investment philosophy for me, over the long run, and this video just confirms that.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the best well known investors, such as Warren Buffett, are value investors.  One caveat: value investing is probably the most painful in the short run (do you have the intestinal fortitude?), as it involves watching your fellow investors making money getting on the latest investing fad of the day and subsequently crashing (think dot com bubble, dot com bubble), while you wait a longer time waiting for the market to swing back to your undervalued stocks.",1355443200,,1078,4.759358288770054
