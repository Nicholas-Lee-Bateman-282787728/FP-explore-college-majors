Good thing there is a REVIEW at the end of the show!!!!! To remind us what we learned during the program! Amazing! Almost better than Sesame Street, except, I prefer more plush animated character puppets to the one creature, JibberBoosh, the star of the show...  Perhaps, that is merely my opinion, though? The child seems to love it. That's what counts!",1281398400,,554,4.585858585858586
7971454,4,B00006LPBR,"My daughter saw this in a rental store and asked me to get it for her.  I had never seen this character before.  She loved the video.  Jibber is somewhere beyond Barney but not for the older kids.  The box says from 3 to 8 years.  My daughter is 3 1/2 and the video is just right for her age range.  I would not recommend this for a 6 year old.  The pace moves quickly as they bring in new characters, but only for a few minutes for each one.",1054598400,,442,3.8444444444444446
