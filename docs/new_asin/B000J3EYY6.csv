Modest production values, but reasonably well-researched.

This video tour of Singapore primarily focuses on historical and natural attractions. Various sites are presented as sequences of lingering shots with narration, with the result that the video shares a relatively small number of specific places, but with better coverage than would be possible if they had tried to be more comprehensive. This includes a good portion of the nighttime lights and fountain show at Sentosa.

By design or not, most of the content of the video is of areas of Singapore that are likely to stay the same for some time. Interestingly, even the famed hawker centers are barely mentioned. On the one hand, this means that there are a number of quintessentially Singaporean experiences left out of the video, but on the other hand it means that the video is likely to remain relevant longer. Even the hawker centers seem to be in a bit of a decline, and places like Clark Quay and indeed the whole Singapore River waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment since this video appears to have been taken.

Naturally, since it was produced some time ago (Amazon puts the release date at eight years ago), it couldn't have included the most recent things, even if the producers had wanted to. In addition to the newly-developed riverfront marketplaces, there is now the Singapore Flyer ""observation wheel"", the Marina Bay Sands casino and resort, and the Gardens by the Bay. Sentosa has also had a nice renovation; many of the things seen in the video are still there, including of course the Merlion, and also the Underwater World (be sure to take advantage of feeding time with the rays, when visitors can let the rays slurp their food from your hand), but they have completely redone the causeway to the island, and there are lots of new attractions and redevelopment at Sentosa proper.

Anyway, taking into account that the video hardly does Singapore justice, but recognizing that it probably couldn't in just an hour anyway, and that the choice of content here ensures that was _is_ in the video will remain relevant for some time to come, this seems like a good introduction to some of the beauty and cultural experiences Singapore has to offer.",1385510400,,2428,5.296103896103896

8149008,5,B000J3EYY6,I purchased this DVD to show my boyfriend where I'm from because he's going to visit Malaysia and Singapore with me later this year.  This DVD was so informative that we made a list of everything we wanted to see there.  It mentioned everything accurately and didn't miss a thing.  I liked how it explains the different districts and how to get around.,1236729600,3,352,4.555555555555555
