8100951,5,B000CR7U6S,"I believe this, as well as Coach Sokaitis' DVDs on offense and defense are incredible and I highly recommend them.  From most instructional books or DVDs on basketball, I normally expect a few bits of info I can use from across the entire book/DVD filled in with a lot of things I already knew in between.  Coach Sokaitis' DVDs are just incredible.  He really has a way of teaching the game of basketball.  I truly believe every minute of the videos are useful, regardless of prior experience or education on basketball.",1396656000,,520,4.681318681318682
