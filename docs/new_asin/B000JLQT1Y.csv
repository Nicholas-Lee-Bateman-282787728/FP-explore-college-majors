8152100,3,B000JLQT1Y,It was a cute film. I think I expected too much. Good casting with Dinah Manoff and Lindsay Wagner.,1482796800,,99,4.2631578947368425
8152101,5,B000JLQT1Y,"I remember seeing this movie many years ago on the 'Movie of the Week', and for some reason it always stayed with me. I was very happy to find it on DVD! Yes, it is alittle dated, but still very charming. Love the stories of each woman Lindsay Wagner, Dinah Manoff, Marcy Walker, and Valerie Landsburg. Since we don't get to see these actresses in movies/TV any very often any longer, I really enjoyed seeing them in this movie. I was always a big fan of Lindsay Wagner, and she is as usual wonderful in this movie. If you enjoy the vintage TV movies that were so popular from the 70s - 90s, than this one might be for you.",1470787200,,623,4.2

8152109,1,B000JLQT1Y,"Just awful. Horrible acting, horrible scenarios, total waste of time. The ONLY nice touch were the authentic deaf kids. It was really nice to see them included instead of the usual hearing children. I appreciate that effort.",1391817600,6,224,5.081081081081081
