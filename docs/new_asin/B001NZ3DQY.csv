8583905,5,B001NZ3DQY,"Treasure Divers of Vigo Bay is a classic. It may be the only documentation on the story of a team of divers in the 1950s that spent four years searching Spain's Vigo Bay. They were seeking remnants of galleons and gold coins.

Director Owen Lee, who previously worked as a cameraman for Jacques Cousteau himself, was also one of the five divers on the treasure hunter team. The trials and tribulations that the team went through during its four-year effort are fascinating.

This is a DVD adaptation of the original documentary film, which was among the first of its kind. I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in scuba diving and/or history.

It should be noted that the DVD, made from the original 16 mm film, is reflective of an aged film.",1277337600,,746,4.636363636363637
