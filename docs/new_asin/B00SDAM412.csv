8698156,4,B00SDAM412,"A generous four stars here. What you get in this release is a double DVD set (total running time 350 minutes) comprising six stand alone documentaries. These are;

The London Underground
Royal London
Parks
The River Thames
Castles
Palaces

Given you can often pick this up fairly cheap you are getting value for money. And for history buffs there is probably a lot to like here. Those more interested in architecture as a stand alone topic will also find plenty of visual eye candy. And the episode on the London underground will have technophiles and train buffs in raptures.

Presentation of the series is fairly staid, there isn't a lot of life to the way the presenter goes about his business. In fact the al- pervasive vibe of this set is one of staid understatement. Given the sorts of events sometimes described in the documentaries youd think it could have been presented in a more dramatic fashion.

At the end of the day this is certainly a product aimed at people interested in London, parts of its architecture and history but is most certainly not aimed at the would-be tourist looking for ideas. Its presentation of the big ticket items won't make you keener to visit them since you almost certainly already are. And given the style of the product you won't find too many lesser known sites that you decide you simply must see on your trip.

The menu of the DVD was easily navigable and it is blessed by being devoid of trailers for other stuff.

A worthwhile purchase for the person who enjoys documentaries and wants to learn more about different aspects of London but not a product that greatly inspires wanderlust.",1459382400,,1632,4.708771929824562

8698159,2,B00SDAM412,Not one of my best purchases. Bought this to prepare for an upcoming trip to London and hoped to get an idea of things we will want to see. More of a 60's pop culture presentation than history. Difficult to watch.,1431561600,4,213,4.219512195121951
