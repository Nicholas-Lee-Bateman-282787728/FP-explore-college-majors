7841502,1,6303241778,"My uncle bought me a two pack including two direct to video movies, Crime Broker and another time waster called Hard Vice. Crime Broker may star the  once famous Jacqueline Bisset, but she definatly can not save this film  from going into the dumpster. It is a very low budget, poorly filmed  Australian movie about a respected judge and mother having a secret life of  crime. Slow moving with hardly any action and poor acting and directing,  making this forgettable and not worth ones time.",966038400,2,492,4.741176470588235
