8367552,5,B002ED6UWS,"Although this black and white film (from 1995) deals solely with Bruckner's hospitalization at Bad Kreuzen in 1867-1868...I believe the film does a spectacular job at showing what it was that set Bruckner on the path towards creating his great masterpieces (that all just after his release)....his proccess of healing renewal from the waters and baths at Bad Kreuzen.

The various types of water treaments given to patients at Bad Kreuzen proved extremely successful.  Here we see early forms of showers, and different bath procedures, hot and cold water soakings and swims in fresh water lakes.

I see this as a sort of mystic healing Bruckner received through all this, a sort of initiatic-Baptism through the waters.  I don't think he would have been the same person if he didn't go to Bad Keuzen..Or perhaps wouldn't have written all those masterpieces...right afterwards to right up until his death!

There is very little acting in the film and mimics the great old black and white films of the early century and the 60's.  There are also some very sensitive moments of flashbacks of Bruckner in St. Florian.  This in my humble opinion helps explain the man at the time of 1867-68, and prophecies the great Bruckner of the future....this is exquisitely done.

The film also focuses on another patient named Otto who writes to his beloved and tells her of a mysterious guest named Bruckner.  This is done through narration, and in Bruckner's scenes as well. The characterization of Bruckner is beautifully acted that you think that you are watching the real Anton!

I recommend this film for anyone who loves Bruckner and wantes to learn just a little more about him.

I disagree with the previous reviewer entirely...it is not boring at all!  It just moves at a relaxed and contemplative pace, leaving the viewer to think about many things on the greatness and strangeness that was Anton Bruckner.

- As a supplement to this film, I highly recommend the 2 hour documentary by Hans Conrad Fischer called ""The Life and Work of Anton Bruckner""...(only on video cassette so far!)",1255651200,7,2080,4.908571428571428
8367553,2,B002ED6UWS,This is a 1995 black and white video and is really boring. It deals with Bruckner's days at a spa before he starting writing his great works. It really moves slow and there are few insights into his life. We see that he had trouble attracting women but otherwise there is not much here. Take a pass.,1250812800,12,299,4.2631578947368425
