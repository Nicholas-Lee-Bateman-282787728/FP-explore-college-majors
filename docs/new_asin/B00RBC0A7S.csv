8694734,5,B00RBC0A7S,"This classic epic spins rings around The Ten Commandments movie. There are fantastic dance scenes and just watching it puts one in an enlightened state of being.

Yes there are some flaws in the DVDs, and the special effects could be better but it's well worth putting up with those flaws for the sake of this majestically produced epic. It takes discipline to look beyond the flaws towards what is actually being presented.

The costumes are beyond fantastic and those king palaces are right out of the best Krishna paintings I have ever seen. Besides the Ramayana created by Ramanand Sagar this creation of his is the best and a bargain at the price it is being sold for.",1228953600,6,673,4.647058823529412
8694735,5,B00RBC0A7S,Krishna a Great Epic but too short a couple technical dvd flaws on the 10th dvd but liveable.  I also viewed the Ramayan by the same author it was also a great epic good acting very dramatic....BUT some technical flaws on the dvd and the english subtitles were not proof read. Worth adding to your Bible collection with other countries scriptures.,1145750400,12,347,4.688524590163935
