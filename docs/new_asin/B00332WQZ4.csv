4063072,5,B00332WQZ4,"The Good Soldier is honest reporting of the experience five US military veterans from World War II to Iraq.  these testamonies are seldom heard in our corporate media world.  Long after citizens have moved on, war veterans continue to suffer the effects of war.  The uniforms, the education benefits, the high tech weapons are well publicized in military ads.  The life long impact of being trained to kill other people and witness and be part of that killing very seldom sees the light of day.  The Good Soldier is a very important contribution to a young person desiring to make an honest, reflective career choice.  there are plenty of slick productions that promote participation in the military without being honest about the personal consequences of being part of killing that comes with war.  This production is well produced and tells the real stories that need to be considered when choosing a military career.

4063096,1,B00332WQZ4,"I am a Vietnam vet as well, and I found this film very one-sided, very anti-war.  Sadly, war will always be with us, but pacifists and liberals think that the freedoms we enjoy are low hanging fruits, free for the taking.  As Flavius Vegetius, a Roman, stated, ""If you want peace, prepare for war.""  There are many vets who do not feel as these veterans feel.  Just because these four are now anti-war due to their past experiences does not mean that they are the norm, or that we should follow in their footsteps. Yes, killing is hard on the soul, but should we do if someone is coming at us to kills us?  Drop our weapons because we do not believe in killing?  Bend over?  War is hell and will continue to be hell until humans progress to the next level of mental and spiritual development.  I am sure that if the country were to be conquered by one or more of our many enemies that the first to be blamed will be the military, probably because they were ""not tough enough,"" as some of the detractors would scream.  We have become a feminized society, and as in history, another more virile country will come along and destroy us.  If you want to see the future of the USA, read about Ancient Rome and how it went from a strong and disciplined military to one where discipline and love of country were cast aside for comfort and profit, where the legions sold the post of emperor to the highest bidder.  If I were young once again, I would rejoin the military, the last remaining bastion of honor and integrity in the country, notwithstanding a few bad apples here and there.",1414540800,4,1577,4.384879725085911

4063098,2,B00332WQZ4,"As a combat wounded veteran, I've experienced the horrors of war.  They're with me everyday, and I was rated 100% disabled due to PTSD.  While I attempted to not do anything in war that would later bother my conscience, I now know that that was naive thinking.  Many good men have warned us about Corporatism and War like Eisenhower, and Smedley Butler.  If these groups truly want peace, then they have to focus on the root cause of these wars, the military industrial complex, and their close association with the leadership of our country. Our military is supported by a vast network of contractors and sub contractors. By the end of Desert Shield/Storm I saw more and more men leaving the military only to start a military contracting/sub contracting business, or get hired by one.  Too many former top brass, and top defense leadership like Cheney, end up working for the military industrial complex. War profiteering is alive and well. The CIA outsources nearly 50 percent of it's entire budget. The military outsources similarly.  When men get rich from war, we are going to see more wars. The movie didn't mention anything about the profiteers:  #1 Caci, #2 Titan, #3 Bechtel, #4 Aegis Defense Services, #5 Custer Battles (found guilty of Fraud), #6 General Dynamics, #7 Nour USA, #8 #9 #10 Chevron/ExxonMobile and Petro Imperialists. These companies just scratch the surface of an much larger, broader iceberg of corporate greed, and political manipulation.  We now have generals that are promoting war not as a last option, but as a first option of solving conflict. Our military has become top heavy, and too many cooks in the kitchen historically is a bad sign for the republic.  Corporatism is destroying our Constitution. We have politicians that think that brainwashing our children to reject our constitution is a good idea instead of teaching them the importance of it.  We need to breakup our current media conglomerates that have monopolized all the news we officially get into six companies.  Companies that all stand to make fortunes in war.  We were warned to never give up our freedoms, but we continue to allow it to happen.  Our schools are failing our children.  Our media are masters of division and misinformation.  CIA/Media talking heads tell us what to think, and how to shut down anyone who opposes the status quo.

4063104,4,B00332WQZ4,"One of the most compelling antiwar films I have seen. The film describes the good soldier as one who obeys orders and unhesitatingly kills the enemy. While this could easily descend into hollow liberal preaching, it does not. Instead the film respectfully tells the stories of a few soldiers who have earned their credibility the hard way. They were trained to kill and placed in combat. Each is uniquely scarred, has a change of heart and seeks healing. Not many answers here but lots of thoughts. One thought is that the price of war is too high. If you want spoon fed liberal pablum, look elsewhere. These guys have my respect.

Not about love, maybe.  Fitting in as the forces allow.
These guys found it hard fitting into the killing machine, and not easy fitting in to civil society after.
So maybe watch this with a young person facing the question of what he wants to do with his life, if you have a relationship that allows that.

4063111,1,B00332WQZ4,"This film shares perspectives from a hand full of veterans - and lots of unfortunate scenes of gratuitous violence and death.

It is not from generations of vets  as to suggest from dozens of perspectives.  It is actually very limited in numerous ways.  While some servicemen and women can relate to the five whole stories recounted and often emotional memories  their shared experiences relate an extremely limited viewpoint.  Keep in mind hundreds of thousands of people fought in these conflicts.

The bottom-line  -- Their stories, while a few of them are very poignant, are carefully selected and edited and slanted by the directors toward pacifist, antiwar sentiments. Most take no slanting at all  half the vets interviewed clearly have unresolved mental issues dealing with their experiences and have become active anti-war protestors.  So how can the viewer expect these particular vets to be objective about their experiences  they each lose some credibility, I think.

To suggest this documentary is a complete look at war and its consequences is ridiculous.

As unfortunate as it may be, there is still evil in the world and still purposeful, strategic purposes for the careful application of force as it is necessary to fight that evil and protect our countrys interests and innocent life here and abroad.

There are much better documentaries done on the costs and impacts of war weighed against its necessity  far more objective than this one.

Youll notice the least shown, and most objective story shared, comes from the WWII vet  but you hear very little from him.  I suspect because it is more difficult for the directors to convince the viewer that WWII was not necessary.",1390262400,12,1691,5.065217391304348

If the anti-war point of view were the only point of view available, even from veterans of the same battles, what would be the point of watching this? Having said that, this is one I would watch again. And again.

I started out thinking that I would probably watch a few minutes and go to bed. Or that I would be frustrated and turn it off as soon as the sophomoric sermonizing started. Next thing I knew I was watching the credits roll. There is no sermonizing; there is only heartfelt commentary from combat veterans. Maybe these veterans are right in their hearts but wrong in their conclusions. Or vice versa. I leave that for better men to decide. I just know that when a man speaks straight from the heart, he speaks straight to the heart.

4063121,5,B00332WQZ4,"This movie was deeply moving to me.  It's well made with excellent music and good cinematics.  The stock footage is well chosen and the directors made their point quite well.  I recommend it, especially for anyone contemplating joining the military.  In spite of the negative reviews, I believe it portrays a realistic view of combat and it's effects on veterans.

Here is why I think this film is relevant and worth watching:
For the last decade, Americans have glorified war and somehow have equated support for the troops to support for the political decisions that send them into combat.  It's ok to love the troops and hate the war.  You are not ""un-American"" for opposing a war.  Our service members have raised their hands and sworn to put their very lives on the line to protect and serve you.  If you need them to fight, they will give you 100% and not hold back.  All they ask in return is two things:  Don't waste their sacrifices on a frivolous war.  And try not to put them in a position where they have to do evil.  They have to live with it later, you don't.

This film shows some of the things your son or nephew may be living with after he comes back.  It illustrates the long term harm caused by serving in the military where norms and conventions are suspended or radically changed.  The military always changes you, usually for the better, but sometimes for the worst.  All service members know the feeling of trying to go back home and no longer fitting in.  This feeling is intensified if they had to live in a combat zone.

Combat is toxic.  Living with danger and death under constant stress and fear produces long term harm.  The peer pressure you feel is intense to the point of self destruction.  Every person you are forced to kill takes away a little bit of your soul and killing an innocent only compounds this.  You experience hurricanes of emotion punctuated by long periods of mind numbing tedium.  When you finally get sent back to ""the real world"", you are expected to turn it all off and be normal again...but you may have forgotten what normal is.  The conventions of polite society may not make sense to you anymore.  The simple act of using a flush toilet may seem surreal to you.  You may feel panic when you hear certain sounds or laugh at the wrong things or wake up screaming from nightmares every night.

Most combat veterans can't even talk about their experiences and have to work through their rehabilitation all alone.  Friends and family who didn't share the experience of combat have no frame of reference.  Most survivors feel shame, either in their own performance or in having killed.  They often feel intense guilt that they let their comrades down...even when they didn't.  They also feel guilty because of the elation they feel.  It's very common for superior soldiers who performed brilliantly to come back from a war feeling as though they failed. They survived and some of their buddies didn't.  Also, I have never met a veteran without some kind of regrets.  We all wish we could change something we did or failed to do.

I believe veterans go through several stages of recovery after combat.  Each of the veterans in the movie are working through these stages.

1.  Elation and pride.  Sometimes anger at the enemy.  This quickly fades, but it's intense for a short period.
2.  Shame and confusion (often anger at whatever put them there) as they try to transition back to normal.
3.  Grief.  Part of their soul got lost.  Many of them try to find it again.
4.  Understanding.  They may always feel the distant emotions, but they have worked through it.

The veterans in this film share experiences and emotion.  That's hard to do.  My hat goes off to each of them. They are all against war.  There is nothing surprising or shameful about that.  Every one of them is trying in his own way to keep others from having to go through what they did.",1365206400,,3905,4.585507246376811

4063123,5,B00332WQZ4,"This documentary profiles five combat veterans:
one from WW-II, two from VN and one each from
Desert Storm & Iraq.

The last four felt betrayed by being sent into
unnecessary wars or being expected to kill
or having killed non-combatants.

I felt the same way upon my return from two
tours in VN -- but many of my fellow soldiers
accepted, supported or wanted to go back
and ''win'' the war.

IMHO, the majority of folks in the world
don't want war.

So those in power who do wage war,
whether for profits, resources, territory,
slavery, religion or glory --
don't represent the folks on the street,
but they sure know how to fire up their
populations to support their wars.

This was an extraordinary documentary.

I would have liked to seen a veteran from
the war in Korea -- but just the same,
this film does a great service to those of
us who return from war and struggle with
post-combat syndrome -- because of what
we saw, did or experienced.

Ask not what your country can do for you,
ask why your country wants you to kill those people
(before you go to enlist).",1354924800,,1070,4.428571428571429

If the military wasn't your cup of tea or you don't want to do it then please do not crush the people that make the decision to serve. This film is extremely offensive to people that serve/have served. Maybe there are some who are not proud of things they have done, but there are people that have had to kill to save theirs or their buddies lives. Going to war is not about killing innocent people, it is about serving your country and carrying out whatever it is they ask of you so that a mass draft does not have to be reinstated. This film is propoganda, hippie, and straight unamerican trash. Today's military is filled with affluent, intelligent individuals who have made a conscious decision to go do whatever their county asks of them. You don't have to agree with it, but please support the troops, because they are volunteering so that others aren't forced to.",1354838400,13,958,4.48

The obvious answer is explored in this movie: war is ugly.  There is more to this film; just watch it and you will see.  While this movie resonates to some degree with me, I feel like the movie is missing something.  I'm not going to analyze the issue here in this post.  I'll keep mulling this one over for probably a few more years.  This was a good movie, but I don't know if it would be an effective message for late teens to early twenties males; the message conveyed here is too easy to be discounted as ""just a bunch of cowards,"" despite their obvious sincerity.  Despite this, I believe an effective message does exist, and I'll keep searching for it.  To the creators of this film, thank you for this documentary.",1349568000,3,896,4.487654320987654

The time lines of enlisting, going to war, the phases of being a good soldier and the resulting aftermath.  This film is both a historical record and a personal record.  The soldiers talk about their mind set going into war and what happened in the heat of battle and their emotions and troubles dealing with their actions afterwards. I've never seen a more honest account of war before.  Personally, I am not an anti-war person but this film did explore areas I had not truly and honestly wanted to think about.

Those movies seduce naive teens and enroll them in the next military recruitment class.  This immensely sobering documentary quietly dissolves such myths and falsehoods.  So, if you want to recruit more unthinking young men and women to stain the soil and sand of the next American war, buy or rent something featuring John Wayne or Sylvester Stalone.  If, on the other hand, you are willing to face the searing, unabashed truth about war, this is the film for you.

I spent 3.5 years fighting in Iraq so I know exactly what these guys are talking about. I suffer from PTSD from my time over there so I can relate to what they are saying and feeling. I feel the same way, but let's not forget, no one drafted us to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan like they did in World War II or Vietnam. We all volunteered and yes, the poor do tend to make up a large percentage of the military. But you know what, the military gave me the GI Bill and allowed me to earn my college degree as well. The military gave me a lot of skills, determination and critical thinking skills that have served me well in life. Yes I live with PTSD from the things we did in Iraq, and yes I wish things had turned out differently, but at the end of the day, I'm proud to have served in the military like my past family members. I'm proud to have served during a war, even if I did not always agree with the war or how it was being fought. I honored my oath and my commitment and I'll carry those burdens with me.

What I heard was a handful of confused old men talking about being confused young men. That man described a war crime and should have been punished. He still should be. In 3 tours of duty and being an Infantry Staff Sergeant myself, I can't abide these actions. It makes me sick to think that US Service Members could be such armatures. Better training from the bottom up and better leadership from the top down is what is needed to make a good soldier. If you have problems with what you do in combat then you are doing it wrong. If I ever finish watching this it will be to gain a better sense of how to fill the gaps in training that make men poor performers so that my men come home proud of their actions in service to this country.

Well, I am tired of listening to the remorse of soldiers, who did their duty as best they could and then are dragged out to share their shame for being in battle or the decisions they made during whatever mission they were tasked.  I know plenty of men who function quite well after experiencing much the same thing, they are not sick, they are not racked by guilt; war is ugly indeed and there will be more of them and perhaps very soon under the current failed and failing leadership.  This film was an exposition of the four men at a low point in their remembrances, their personal bravery cannot be slandered, but we need to rid ourselves of this western addiction to self-absorption and analysis; it's paralyzing.
