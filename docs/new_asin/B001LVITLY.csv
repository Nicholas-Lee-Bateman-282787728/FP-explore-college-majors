8319885,5,B001LVITLY,"Absolutely a must if you are a serious student of self defense and martial arts.  Ed's focus on distractions that allow the defender to find and take advantage of what vulnerable body position the attacker gives is portrayed well in this dvd.  Inside both volume one and two there are vital bits of information to learn & practice.  The student learns different take downs and defensive body techniques that are practical.  Worth your time and money.  Joint locking, especially finger locks are actually techniques that are not fancy but do the required work with less effort, for a student of self defensive martial arts, like Small Circle Jujitsu, will need to get out of a harmful situation.",1404950400,,694,4.897435897435898
