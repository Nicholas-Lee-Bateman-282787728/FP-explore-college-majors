2896273,5,B000TD2KY2,"""All in the Family"" began its final season in the fall of 1978. Although Archie would ultimately live on in its spin-off ""Archie Bunker's Place"", ""All in the Family"" finished its run as a first-run network comedy on CBS on the night of April 8, 1979. That episode entitled ""Too Good Edith"" garnered 40.2 million viewers, one of the highest rated finales in television history.

 The ninth year (finishing at #9 in the national Nielsens) dealt with Archie and Edith living their lives alone without Gloria and Mike as the later moved to California. This plot twist was due to both Sally Struthers and Rob Reiner's desire to leave the series. Both, however, would return one final time in the episode ""California, Here We Are"", a one-hour Christmas show where Edith and Archie visit Mike, Gloria, and little Joey.

 The final season also consisted of the addition of Danielle Brisebois as Stephanie, a young girl the Bunkers took in after her father abandoned her.

 Included in this fantastic box set is the rarely seen 90 minute 200th episode of ""All in the Family"" hosted by series creator Norman Lear. That episode is hardly seen in syndication and cable airings so it's wonderful Shout! has included it as part of this release.

 A total of 24 episodes are included, but like other sets there are no special bonus features.

2896274,5,B000TD2KY2,"The ninth and (sniff) final season of All in the Family is finally being released on DVD by SHOUT! Factory. Thank you so much Shout! for picking up the pieces after Sony left the release of this series in shambles. I certainly hope you obtain the rights to Archie Bunker's Place, not as classic as AITF but still a fun series and many people would love seasons two, three and four on DVD

After ""little goil"" and ""meathead"" left for California at the end of last season this season finds Archie and Edith starting out alone. Soon enough, in the first episode as a matter of fact, Danielle Brisebois joins the cast as Stephanie and adds a fun dynamic by giving us a look at Archie and Edith as parents of a young child (I always watch these episodes and think of them as a look back on what it might have been like for Gloria growing up, despite Archie having mellowed considerably since then). After a truly great eighth season, though one with many multipart arcs, the final season switches back to more of a one topic per episode format with the exception of the spectacular Christmas episode.

This final season contains the following 24 episodes (27 if you count the restrospective):

Little Miss Bunker (9/24/1978)
Edith's cousin Floyd abandon's his nine year old daughter Stephanie on the bunker's doorstep.

End in Sight (10/1/1978)
Archie wallows in self-pity after an ominous spout is found on his liver during an insurance physical.

Reunion on Hauser Street (10/8/1978)
The Bunker's try to reunite Barney Hefner with his wife Blanche.

What'll We Do with Stephanie? (10/15/1978)
When Floyd fails to pick Stephanie up as promised the Bunkers debate keeping her.

Edith's Final Respects (10/22/1978)
When her Aunt Rose dies, Edith is the only mourner at her funeral. (A lot of Edith's relatives seem to die throughout the course of the series).

Weekend in the Country (10/29/1978)
A weekend at Barney and Blanche's cottage goes wrong when a game of monopoly sparks a fight and Archie spends the night with Barney and Edith with Blanche.

Archie's Other Wife (11/5/1978)
Archie wakes up at an American Legion Convention to find a beautiful african-american flight attendant in his hotel bed who swears they were married the night before.

Edith Vs. The Bank (11/19/1978)
Edith wants to buy Archie a new television for their 30th anniversary but when the store won't let her sign alone and the bank won't give her a loan because she's a housewife she arrives home upset only to find Archie may be sexist himself.

Return of the Waitress (11/26/1978)
When Harry hires the waitress who Archie once cheated on Edith with to work at Archie Bunker's Place, Edith finally confronts her.

Bogus Bills (12/3/1978)
Edith gets arrested for using fake ten dollar bills she got from Archie Bunker's Place.

The Bunkers Go West (12/10/1978)
Archie, Edith and Stephanie make the trip out west to visit Mike and Gloria when they can't come home for Christmas because Mike has supposedly hurt his back.

California, Here We Are (12/17/1978)
The Bunkers arrive in California and get to see Mike and Gloria's new home and little Joey. It isn't long before we learn that Mike and Gloria are actually putting on an act and that the real reason they didn't come home is because they have separated.

California, Here We Are (2) (12/17/1978)
After Mike and Gloria get in a fight on Christmas eve Edith, and soon after Archie, learn of their marital troubles. Things get more complicated when it is revealed it may not be all Mike's fault. Though Christmas morning brings a reconciliation of sorts there is much to be worked out.

(All in the Family always chose to do their most series episodes over Christmas. Edith's lump in her breast, the draft dodger, the death of Beverly Lasalle. Odd choice but it always seemed to work for them)

A Night at the PTA (1/7/1979)
Edith is supposed to sing a duet with Stephanie for the PTA recital but when she develops laryngitis Archie steps in. (Really how much worse could he be?)

A Girl Like Edith (1/14/1979)
Edith invites butcher Klemmer over for dinner but when he brings a Russian girl who looks just like Edith she begins to realize he may be more interested in her than his date.

The Appendectomy (1/21/1979)
On the eve of Stephanie's tenth birthday she begins getting serious pains in her side. When Dr. Shapiro says she will need an appendectomy Archie gets in an argument over wanting the older more experienced Dr. Shapiro to do the operation. Can Archie put aside his issues this once for Stephanie's sake?

Stephanie and the Crime Wave (1/28/1979)
Archie and Edith discover Stephanie has been stealing their, and her teacher's, favorite items. A deeper psychological issue emerges though when she tells them its because she wants to remember them when she inevitably leaves.

Barney the Golddigger (2/4/1979)
Barney Hefner is suicidal when Blanche leaves him again, until Archie sets him up with an overweight but wealthy woman.

The Return of Archie's Brother (2/11/1979)
Archie's brother Fred visits for dinner to discuss a new business but when his 18 year old wife Katherine may have more in common with Stephanie than with Edith the night takes a turn for the awkward. (An episode up to the classic AITF standard, IMO)

Stephanie's Conversion (2/18/1979)
When Edith is told that Stephanie is Jewish she and Archie disagree on how to raise her. Another issue arises when Stephanie reveals she kept her background secret in fear of Uncle Archie not loving her anymore. (Another GREAT episode)

Edith Gets Fired (2/25/1979)
After agreeing with an elderly woman's wishes to sit with her while she passes away, Edith is fired from the sunshine home and verbally attacked by her angered family members.

This is where the All in the Family Retrospective hour and a half special would fit (3/4/1979)

The Family Next Door (3/11/1979)
Louise Jefferson returns to enlist the help of Edith in selling their old house next door. Archie hopes this will allow him to keep the neighborhood white.

The Return of Stephanie's Father (3/25/1979)
Edith's cousin Floyd returns offering to let the Bunker's keep Stephanie for $1000 in cash. When his offer turns into a threat to take Stephanie away unless he is paid the Bunker's have to think fast if they want to keep Stephanie where she belongs.

Too Good Edith (4/8/1979)
St. Patrick's day is approaching and will be a busy day for Archie Bunker's Place. Edith gets sick and is told to stay off her feet but wants to be there for Archie who keeps asking for her to help prepare. When her illness worsens the doctor arrives and blames Archie for forcing Edith to work despite doctor's orders only to learn Edith never told Archie. Archie goes upstairs and lays by Edith's side telling her how much she means to him.

A good season to go out on. The three part story where the Bunker's go west and reunite with Mike and Gloria only to learn they have been separated is truly the highlight of this season much like the Thanksgiving episode in the first season of Archie Bunker's Place. Anytime the original cast gets back together there's something electric, they are just perfect together and feel like family. Also this season are the wondeful episodes where the Bunker's deal with Stephanie in emotional moments in several episodes, The Family Next Door really helps tie the final season to the first and finally there is Too Good Edith, which is in retrospect a tuly touching episode to end on with a final scene that really sums up the series.

Special Features:

Not technically a special feature but supposedly being included as one, the All in the Family 200th episode retrospective. Norman Lear hosts an affectionate look back on high points of the groundbreaking and much beloved series.

While not as classic as early seasons of the show, and not quite the same without Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers the show still retains a heart and has its share of laughs. Five Stars for me but if by some chance someone is new to All in the Family and looking at this, go get the earlier seasons first, two is the strongest season to start with and three is ironically a close second, IMO and based on initial ratings anyways.

P.S. Why isn't Stephanie on the box cover? No arguments here so long as it's released but I feel she should be, maybe I'm the only one.",1298073600,33,8342,4.774843641417651

2896276,5,B000TD2KY2,"This ninth and final season of CBS's legendary All In The Family is very much different than the previous ones. Danielle Brisebois(briz bwah) joins remaining original cast members the late Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton as Stephanie Mills,a distant niece of Edith Bunker's(Stapleton) who had been abandoned by her widowed alcoholic father. Brisebois was brought in to fill the vacancies left by other original AITF cast members Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers who had departed in early 1978. Again,there's a new version of Archie(O'Connor) and Edith performing THOSE WERE THE DAYS by Lee Adams and Charles Strouse and a new version of the instrumental REMEMBERING YOU by O'Connor and Roger Kellaway. Also,O'Connor delivers his own closing announcement,""All In The Family was played to a studio audience for live responses."" This is because unlike the previous seasons,there was no audience present while filming. Pre-recorded audience reactions were added to these episodes. This season premiered on September 24,1978 and a distant cousin brings Stephanie to the Bunkers' Queens,New York household. Archie and Edith even locate Stephanie's father(guest star Ben Slack) at a motel where he is staying. To avoid certain heartbreak,Edith books a flight for herself and Archie to California to spend Christmas with their daughter Gloria Bunker Stivic(special guest star Struthers) and her husband Michael(special guest star Reiner). Michael,enjoying his job as a college professor is separated from Gloria but they reunite at their Santa Barbara,CA apartment for 5 days for the sake of her parents. The Stivics were unable to come to New York since Mike was ""hurting""(he was actually faking a bad back and claims he hurt it by lifting a heavy hibachi). Of course,Stephanie flew to California with the Bunkers and found a new playmate in the Stivics' son Joey. Mike's working too much resulted in the Stivics' separation and verge of divorce. In another episode,Archie and Edith spend a weekend at a cabin with Archie's buddy Barney Hefner(recurringly played by the recently departed Allen Melvoin) and Barney's wife Blanche(Estelle Parsons). AITF's spinoff The Jeffersons star Isabel Sanford reprises her character Louise Jefferson telling her former next door neighbors the Bunkers that someone finally bought the Jeffersons' old house which was subsequently rented by the Stivics. Edith lost her job at the Sunshine Home at the demand of a man whose resident mother just died. Edith let the woman die as she requested(she wanted no more treatment or life support). There was also a St. Patrick's Party at Archie's Place in the series finale. In the series' final scene,Edith tells Archie in their bed,""You're a pip,a real pip!"". The camera zooms out from inside the bedroom to a view of the closed door. CBS aired AITF regularly for the final time on September 16,1979 and the following Sunday,the four-season spinoff ARCHIE BUNKER'S PLACE premiered. Norman Lear,who had Americanized the British-based TILL DEATH DO US PART making it AITF,had turned over his title of executive in charge of production to Alan Horn. Like Lear did,Horn assumed the duties for Lear's other created series like TJ and GOOD TIMES,the latter which ended in 1979 as well. Interestingly,like NBC's The Cosby Show would do later,AITF held the #1 Nielsen spot for 5 consecutive seasons.",1190851200,51,3362,5.309568480300188

2896324,3,B000TD2KY2,"The final season of ALL IN THE FAMILY was an anticlimax to the previous season which was the practical last season of the series.
Mike, Gloria, and Joey moved to California and for all of Stephanie's cuteness, the show was never the same.  The show however had one last Christmas get together with the Bunkers and the Stivics.  The season had a 90 minute retrospective of the series hosted by Norman Lear who talked about a 1972 Time magazine cover story The new TV Season: toppling old taboos which also talked about 2 instances in the 1960's.  Anyone who watched the Brady Bunch on a regular basis and was familiar with the bathroom that connected both the boys' and girls' bedrooms could not have guessed that Jack Parr walked off the Tonight Show because NBC deleted the initials W.C. the British term for water closet.  Another thing it talked about contributed to of Debbie Gibson's 1989 song WE COULD BE TOGETHER; 21 years before, Petula Clark rested her hand on Harry Belafonte's shoulder in a special they were both doing.  The representative of the now defunct Plymouth motor division tried to get Petula's innocent action deleted; however, he only got the more inferior takes of their duet deleted and he lost his job for his overt racism.  Petula was not at all scantily clad when performing ON THE PATH OF GLORY with Harry and just recently, I read a story about how country singer Taylor Swift felt about taking chances by revealing too much cleavage.  I actually commented that she can arouse attention just by doing things she can only take for granted and what Petula Clark and Harry Belafonte went through is an example.  I can name some other incidents that happened before and after the time magazine article worthy of ALL IN THE FAMILY...both in the world of sports.  There was both the National Football League belittling and bigoted of the American Football League and I heard that in certain cities and stations, the AFL is not even spoken, even after Joe Namath's guaranteed Jets victory over the Colts.  In baseball, there was also the matter of Mike Andrews of the Oakland Athletics making 2 errors in game 2 of the 1973 World Series which the New York Mets would win in extras.  A's owner Charlie Finley tried to have Andrews suspended just for committing the errors, Mike would make another appearance in the series which the Oakland A's won 4 games to 3.  Getting back to All in the Family, more time was devoted to the former Kelsey's (now Archie's place) Edith was still on the show but Jean Stapleton was leaning towards following Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers out the door leaving Carroll O'Connor the only cast member left.  All in the Family became Archie Bunker's Place the following year Edith only appeared in 5 episodes (including the 2 part overall last hurrah with the Bunkers and Stivics spending Thanksgiving together).  The second season of ABP began with Edith's tragic death of a stroke and the show was living on borrowed time from there.

2896333,5,B000TD2KY2,"The ninth season of All in the Family is also its last. (The following year it would be replaced by Archie Bunkers Place.) By this point Mike and Gloria are out of the picture (except for a three-part episode during the Christmas season). Their absence creates a bit of a vacuum. To fill it, Stephanie Mills (the daughter of a distant cousin of Edith's) is dropped off by her ne'er-do-well father at the Bunker household. This leads to several episodes, first of all determining what to do with her, and, when it becomes clear that she will be living with them permanently, figuring out how to live with a young child in the house. Although Stephanie is not the focus of every episode, she is at the center of a number of them, including one that revolves around the fact that before coming to the Bunkers Stephanie was being raised Jewish. Archie, of course, believes she should be raised Christian, but finally gives in to Edith's wishes.

One of the high point of the season takes place when the Archie, Edith, and Stephanie go to California over Christmas to visit Mike, Gloria, and little Joey. They make a last-minute decision to do this when they receive a phone call from Gloria, who informs them that Mike has hurt his back and can't travel. When they arrive they soon discover that Mike doesn't have a bad back at all, and the only reason the Stivics had cancelled their trip was to hide from Archie and Edith the fact that they had decided to separate.

2896349,3,B000TD2KY2,"The ninth and final season of All In The Family, which finished at #9 n the ratings, somewhat of a decline from Season 8's #4, was really a transitional season between All In The Family and Archie Bunker's Place. Evidence of this can be found in the face that that Mike and Gloria left for California in the previous season's finale, Archie is spending more time at Archie's Place, Edith is still a regular character (not like her recurring role in S1 of ABP), and newcomer Stephanie (Danielle Brisebois), Edith and Archie's niece, moved in, presenting a new set of challenges for the once-again alone Bunkers.

After AITF ended (Good Times ended this season as well), the once-dominant Norman Lear empire was reduced to ABP (which ended at the end of the 1982/83 season), and One Day At A Time (which lasted until 1983/84). That being said, sitcoms declined significantly in the ratings from late 1979 and would not regain dominance until The Cosby Show premiered in September 1984.

NOTE: This was the first episode to be screened to the audience of One Day At A Time for audience reactions, rather than taped in front of a live audience as was the case with Seasons 1-8.

7. Archie's Other Wife (5/11/78): Archie attends an American Legion convention and finds a woman claiming to be his wife...7/10

8. Edith vs The Bank (19/11/78): Edith wants to buy Archie a new TV set, but can't obtain the credit. 5/10

9. Return of the Waitress (26/11/78): Denise, that waitress Archie had a lust for back in Season 7, is now an employee at Archie's Place. 8.5/10

10. Bogus Bills (3/12/78): Edith is arrested for passing a fraudulent $10 bill from Archie's Place. 5.5/10

11. The Bunkers Go West (10/12/78): When Gloria, Mike and Joey cancel their plans to return to 704 Hauser Street for Christmas with no explanation, Edith decides her and Archie should go to California to visit them. 5.5/10

12 + 13. California, Here We Are (17/12/78): Archie is furious when he finds out Gloria has been cheating on Mike. 6/10

14. A Night at the PTA (7/1/79): Edith develops laryngitis and cannot perform with Stephanie at the PTA. 8/10

15. A Girl Like Edith (14/1/79): The butcher that had a lust for Edith last season has a new bride, who looks a LOT like Edith... 7.5/10

16. The Appendectomy (21/1/79): Stephanie develops appendicitis, but Dr. Shapiro isn't available. 6/10

17. Stephanie and the Crime Wave (28/1/79): There's been a crime wave going on around the neighbourhood - and Stephanie's the prime suspect! 7.5/10

19. The Return of Archie's Brother (11/2/79): Fred, Archie's brother, is back with a new, young wife. 6.5/10

20. Stephanie's Conversion (18/2/79): Archie finds out Stephanie is Jewish. 6.5/10

21. Edith Gets Fired (25/2/79): Edith is fired from the Sunshine Home after spending too long off the job... 4/10

26. The Return of Stephanie's Father (25/3/79): Floyd is back for Stephanie, but at a price... 6/10

27. Too Good Edith (8/4/79): Archie asks Edith to help out with cooking for a St. Patrick's Day festival down at Archie's Place, but Archie doesn't know about Edith's phlebitis. 6/10

2896350,5,B000TD2KY2,"This is one of my top three shows. I Love Lucy, The Golden Girls, and All in the Family. (I also love SMALLVILLE but that is a drama so you can't really compare.) I love the controversy. The current events. The taboo topics. And it's all so funny it's all perfectly acceptable. And it is all still so relevant today! I Love Lucy was mostly just for fun, and The Golden Girls was somewhere in between. I love them all. All in the Family was a true gem.

This series as a whole gets 5 stars from me. I'd give seasons one and nine 4.5. Like most people, I feel the loss of half the cast in the last season hurt the show, though of course it was still amazing. Certainly better than most shows you see today. The first season was not as good simply because it needed a few episodes to pick up its momentum. Edith was always my favorite character, and she was a bit timid during those first few episodes. Once she started to develop as a stronger character - and talk back to Archie on occasion - she was hilarious.

Mike and Gloria's departure from the show was unfortunate, but they stayed on the show longer than most shows keep actors. Of course, the show lasted longer than most shows in the first place. The addition of Edith's niece Stephanie was nice, but of course nothing could replace those scream-fests between Archie and Mike. Good for the eardrums, anyway.

I am happy to have finally completed my collection... after that awful several-year wait between seasons 6 and 7. Wonder if they will finish releasing Archie Bunker's Place now?",1332460800,,1544,4.448763250883392

2896356,2,B000TD2KY2,"I knew the minute I saw Mike and Gloria were gone that the final season of ""All in the Family"" would not be a great one. But, collector that I am, I had to have it anyway. Well, now I'm re-selling it. There are no words for how supremely disappointing this goodbye was! Without Mike and Gloria, all the creativity of the show's tension and relationships flew out the window. We do meet a new character, though, in the form of young Stephanie (Danielle Brisebois), the Bunkers' niece, who gets left with them by her struggling father. Brisebois was really no worse than any other child actor in history, but what was meant as another fearless exploration of changing social conventions plays out instead as an otherworldly lark through Shark Jumpers' camp. Stephanie is a fairly grating character in her own right, but the worst of it all is how the attention shifts to Archie's bar and his friendship with Barney Hefner (Allan Melvin). Barney was a mediocre creation to begin with, but when entire episodes (and an entire subplot arc!) revolve around him, it makes you yearn for the equipment to edit him out. To sum up, all the magic is gone. Episodes drag on at unreasonably sluggish paces; the space between witty remarks is almost unbearable sometimes. And in the end, the show makes the same mistake it's made on occasion in the past (taking itself too seriously) for an entire season. Over 30 years later, it's a little late to say it could have been done better, but for the first time in my life, I'd be happy to just own eight ninths of this show.",1309564800,3,1556,4.580645161290323
2896357,5,B000TD2KY2,"Norman Lear's masterpiece has never been better.  It's really so nice to have the episodes dominated by Archie and Edith, and friends, and their new sidekick, Stephanie.  Archie and Edith's relationship is such a contrast to Mike and Gloria's and I was happy to have spent the last season not having to listen to their bickering.  Don't get me wrong, I love all the seasons with them as well, but in later seasons too many episode revolved around stupid marital arguments between them and I really was getting a little tired of it.  Archie and Edith on the other hand, have something really special.  Yes, Archie's his typical self, but Edith never gets upset by it, quite the contrary actually, and it's really something to watch.  No Brady Bunch bliss ever had anything over the Bunker's in spite of how hard boiled Archie could be.  If you liked anything that preceded Season 9, it's a no-brainer you'll be right at home here as well.  I haven't seen the spin-off ""Archie Bunker's Place"" which began after AITF finished, but Edith is going to be sorely missed.  She's always been much the heart and soul of this show, and her character is almost architypically maternal, good-natured and divinely ding-batty.. Watching Archie and Edith together reminds me a little of when I was a kid at my great aunt and uncle's house.  My uncle was actually in World War II, and there's a lot that reminds me of them, minus the bigotry.  Watching this show is like stepping back in time.  But the quality of the writing and acting is something that keeps the show still as relevant now as anything that's been produced since the turn of the millenium.  Season 9 is a great last season.

2896360,4,B000TD2KY2,"It has taken forever, but ""All in the Family"" is FINALLY complete on DVD, thanks to Shout Factory. They accomplished in 8 months what Sony couldn't do in 4 years.

Yes, Season 7 was botched due to video transfer/authoring issues that made for a bizarre, jagged-looking picture, but Shout rectified that with Season 8 and the video quality on this set is just as excellent.

Personally, I had not planned on adding this release to my collection since I believe the Season 8 finale was the perfect send-off for the series (and one of TV's best and most appropriate finales ever IMO) but being a completist and wanting to support Shout Factory, I decided to get it after all. Twenty bucks for 23 episodes plus a 90-minute retrospective IS a good deal when a night at the movies including gas and parking will cost you that much or more.

I admit this season is perhaps the low point of the series, with the addition of Danielle Brisebois as little Stephanie whom the Bunkers adopt. Archie has mellowed and without a good sparring partner, the character isn't what he used to be. Mike and Gloria moved to California last season (Reiner and Struthers appear in an hour-long episode when Archie and Edith trek to California for a visit). But the worst of ""All in the Family"" is still as good as, or even better than the best of something like ""Two and a Half Men"".

My favorite episode of this set is ""Edith Gets Fired"" in which our beloved volunteer at the Sunshine Home is relieved of her duties because she obeys a dying woman's last wish to die with dignity. Even though Jean Stapleton was tiring of her role at this point, she still delivers top-notch performances. Sitting alone in the kitchen trying to reconcile what happened, her expressions speak volumes without saying a word. A testament to a great actress. Watch for Archie's initial shock when he learns Edith did nothing to save a life--also priceless.

Another big draw for me in owning this was to get the 200th episode 90-minute celebration. Not content with just being a standard series retrospective/clip show (like the 1991 20th Anniversary special), here we see couples from every state arriving in formal wear to the taped gala event. It's odd hearing their names announced as if they were celebrities arriving at the Emmys instead of just everyday Mom-and-Pops-from-Middle-America. Stranger still is the ""after-party"" footage of these various average-Joes hob-knobbing with the cast, dancing, engaging in polite cheek-kissing and hand-shaking. Look for Penny Marshall there with hubby Rob Reiner sans toupee, and Jean Stapleton's inspired choice of evening wear: a Japanese silk kimono.

I am really grateful to Shout Factory for finally completing this series in such a short time. Now we just need to get them started on the rest of ""Maude"".",1306022400,3,2811,4.8580375782881005

2896365,4,B000TD2KY2,"I'm pleased that Shout Factory is making the last of the AITF episodes available, because any chance to see more of one of my 3 all time favorite series is certainly welcome.  But IMHO this season almost ""jumped the shark"" with the addition of the nauseatingly cloying Danielle Brisebois.  The loss of Mike and Gloria didn't really require the addition of another member of the immediate Bunker household.  There were other characters in the neighborhood and down at Archie's Place who could have filled the gap far more ably than the minimally talented Brisebois.  Her presence almost ruins some of the episodes for me.

In addition, the decision to stop doing the show before a live audience was extremely detrimental.  Both O'Connor and Stapleton worked at their best in front of a live audience, and without one the entire rhythm of this season is just slightly off.  (I Love Lucy suffered the same fate when it went audience-less for the Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour -- something almost intangible but very necessary was lost.)  Thus I have to give this collection 4 stars instead of 5, though I'd actually give it 3.5 if that were possible.",1299974400,3,1139,4.835051546391752
