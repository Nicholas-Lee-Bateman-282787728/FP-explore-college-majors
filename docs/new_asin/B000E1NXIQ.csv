A friend of mine actually played the role of Freddie in this movie and after weeks of begging him he finally let me watch it. It's not terrible, but unless you're watching with your children or something don't waste your time because you will definitely want that 90 minutes back. My friend is under contract for a sequel so I'm praying they make a second film... especially now that he's in his mid 20's. Anyways I figured I would post something since apparently NO ONE else has ever seen this movie lol. Love you Rev.",1252540800,,687,4.375
