3788802,5,B001TC8PNM,This is such a perfect workout! I love how it is challenging but doable! I also love that i can pick and choose the segments if i am not feeling up to the full workout! I love the stretching... it really releases stress and the little aches and pains of pregnancy! I always feel renewed and refreshed after this workout!  Thank you both Suzanne and Leah for this inspiring and encouraging workout DVD! A must have for mommies!!!!!,1235260800,,430,4.512820512820513
3788803,5,B001TC8PNM,"I'm 7 months pregnant, and highly recommend Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Work Out (even if you are not pregnant). Finally, a prenatal dvd that actually tones the body without jerking!! You definitely ""feel the burn,"" without feeling like you're hurting the baby.
My favorite section is the stretching. It totally relaxes and stretches out my pregnancy hip aches. The music is meditative and inspiring. I feel totally de-stressed and focused on loving my baby and body.
Another plus, a hidden surprise, there's a postnatal work out. Also, I love that I can do the work out with just the music, which helps me focus even more.
I couldn't get through the rest of my pregnancy without this! I get people commenting on how fit I am at 7 months. Preggo's you must get this DVD!!",1235088000,116,782,4.7153284671532845
3788804,5,B001TC8PNM,"This video truly allows expecting mothers to not only strengthen their bodies through gentle yet effective movement, it also balances and calms the mind...
Suzanne Bowen and Leah Sarago are top notch fitness experts and I truly enjoy learning from them and using their concepts to better my own physical health!",1234828800,2,311,5.117647058823529
3788831,3,B001TC8PNM,Good exercises to do while pregnant at home.  It was not difficult.  My toddler also participated.,1480377600,,98,5.0625
3788832,4,B001TC8PNM,Good video...not too hard but challenging enough for anow expecting mother! You can work up a little sweat. Great for toning not really a cardio workout. Good stretching techniques too!,1474329600,,185,5.2
3788833,5,B001TC8PNM,"This is a great workout!  Gets the heart beating, but not so intensely that you are worried about the baby.  It works the muscles in a way that makes you realize you worked out, but you're not so sore that you can't function.",1471737600,5,225,4.209302325581396
3788834,5,B001TC8PNM,Exactly as described. Thank you!,1471392000,,32,5.6
3788835,3,B001TC8PNM,I purchased this because I loved the slim and toned workout so much and wanted some variety. This one must have been filmed many years earlier. I don't feel like the exercises are as effective and she doesn't do them for long enough it seems,1470528000,,241,4.377777777777778
3788836,4,B001TC8PNM,This is a great workout. It's relaxing yet you can still work up a good sweat.  I was doing a lot of barre workouts and some cardio beforehand so I wouldn't say it's totally for beginners (just the floor part of the workout).  I do have to modify the floor part a bit though. If you were doing a lot of yoga then I'm sure it's easy. I love the relaxation part at the end!,1470355200,,371,3.933333333333333

3788840,4,B001TC8PNM,"This is probably my second favorite prenatal exercise DVD that I have ordered. It's a good quick workout (two 20 minute sections +10 minute stretching). I do wish it was a little more challenging. I tend to do this 1-2 days a week when I don't want to leave the house to go to the gym, or when I'm short on time. Having prenatal workout DVDs like this one have definitely helped me stay on track this pregnancy.",1464134400,3,411,4.282051282051282

3788853,4,B001TC8PNM,"I read a lot of reviews on this dvd before I ordered it, but I agree with the majority & really like it.  I have enjoyed getting a decent workout in 20 min. if I just do one segment.  She does move fairly quickly though in the video.  I am an active person & at 18 weeks pregnant am still running outside.  However, the video could get really challenging in the next 2 months with some of the positions the video has you in.  Overall, great exercise dvd-would recommend.",1457568000,3,470,4.235955056179775
3788854,5,B001TC8PNM,"This was my first pregnancy (I'm now 30 weeks pregnant) and I used this in conjunction with biking on my stationary bike and walking, as well as Joy Southworth's 'Body by Trimester'. I wrote a review for 'Body by Trimester' as well and can't speak highly enough about it. The same is true for this dvd. It is perfect to use in rotation with weight training. It has the perfect combination of relaxation/yoga as well as light cardio to get your heart rate up. I also bought Suzanne Bowen's Slim and Toned prenatal workout (which I do use from time to time and enjoy), but I think this one is better.

There is a great stretching and relaxation segment at the end of the dvd, and I always feel so refreshed after doing this workout. Thank you Suzanne!",1456444800,4,749,4.427536231884058
3788855,5,B001TC8PNM,"I absolutely LOVED this dvd for doing some prenatal Pilates at home!! I was really nervous because I have tried many other regular workout DVDs and haven't found anything I've really liked. I found this, read some reviews, and decided to try it. I was so happy I did. I felt like I got a great workout for my entire body. Suzanne Bowen gave options for those at different levels and trimesters and also separated the dvd into different body groups (such as legs, etc.). So if I didn't have much time and wanted to focus on legs then I would just do that segment. I began using it in my first trimester and continued up until I gave birth. I believe it was one if the reasons I stayed in such great shape. An extra bonus is the stretching and relaxation segment at the end as well as the postnatal ab workout! If you're looking for a great prenatal workout dvd this one is it.",1454457600,5,875,4.27710843373494
3788856,5,B001TC8PNM,Amazing! Did this workout every day while I was pregnant. So worth it! Makes you feel great,1454457600,,91,4.411764705882353
3788857,5,B001TC8PNM,"Absolutely love this. I've only ever tried yoga once before and it was super intense. However, I was so sick the first 20 weeks I could not continue weight lifting. After those 20 weeks, I found that lifting hard just over exhausted me and was totally uncomfortable with my belly. I have a really bad knee so exercise is extremely important to keep my knee strong. This video was relaxing and calming while at the same time really working my muscles. It took my stress levels from a 10 to a 1 and has helped so much with my typical pregnancy aches and pains. The 60 minutes feels like only 20 and you really feel it strengthening your muscles.",1452643200,11,643,4.411764705882353
3788858,4,B001TC8PNM,"This is a great pregnancy workout , that actually feels like a real workout ! I've found some pregnancy workouts boring / too easy . The only down side is the floor work became a little uncomfortable in my 3rd trimester.",1445904000,,220,4.390243902439025
3788859,3,B001TC8PNM,"The workout is pretty boring because it repeats each move 3 times in a row. That being said, it was a good low impact workout for me to do all throughout my pregnancy (although some of the stretches and floor exercises became pretty difficult towards the end of my pregnancy). I continue do this workout when I want to lighter routine even after pregnancy. The post natal ab segment was great at first, and helped me to strengthen my post baby abs, but it quickly became too easy. Overall, this is an okay workout with straight forward easy to follow instructions.",1444953600,2,564,4.594059405940594
3788860,4,B001TC8PNM,"It's worth mentioning that I have minimal experience with Pilates. I just completed the full workout for the first time. Overall, I really enjoyed it! I feel I got a great workout without being too fatigued. The pace was perfect.

I particularly enjoyed the standing work. When it came to the mat work, I actually thought it would be easier. Silly me though; I forgot how difficult Pilates can be!

I will admit when it came to the floor work, it was a little more difficult to follow as I had to constantly look up at my tv to know what was going on. I found myself getting confused, so I wish the verbal cues were be just little bit more descriptive. With practice, I'm sure I will get the hang of it though.",1442361600,2,710,4.291044776119403
3788871,4,B001TC8PNM,"IDK. I got these bc I am now in the my third trimester and have been so weakened from my pregnancy that I couldn't keep up with my old DVDs anymore.  I thought this would help. It's ok. The production value is not that great. My husband peaked on me one day at me doing this and commented that he thought it looked like someone made this at home for me!  It's really easy on my joints and it's got short segments which I appreciate in my current condition since I can't do much past 10 minutes now.  I have started to get a hernia from all the squatting though and leaning forward with my weight bearing down on my pelvic area so this may not really be that great.  At this point, I just feel my pride is assuaged bc I can keep ""working out"" but not sure if I'm really getting a proper work out or should be doing this much more. My favorite exercising now is to lie on my couch and rest bowl of dip on my baby belly as I snuggle with a doggie or read a book at this point.",1437955200,2,973,3.9489795918367347
3788872,2,B001TC8PNM,"If you don't like the monotonous repetition of Pilates, you will hate this workout. It consists of three sections: standing (20 min), floor work (20 min), and stretching (10 min). The standing section is very repetitive, essentially 20 minutes of squats with various arm movements. It made my muscles tired, but didn't get my heart pumping. It's very hard on the knees. The floor work is Pilates, and includes lots of push ups. There are better, safer ways to work the arms during pregnancy. I was very disappointed, and ended up fast forwarding through much of this section. The instructor barely looks pregnant. So far the best prenatal DVD I've tried is, believe it or not, Denise Austin!",1437609600,3,691,4.864406779661017
3788873,5,B001TC8PNM,This woman.  She is THE best.  Love this DVD and Suzanne's online streaming exercises.  She knows exactly how motivate pregnant mamas and moms alike.  Great!!,1436918400,,158,5.2
3788874,5,B001TC8PNM,I love it! I do it on the days I don't go for runs or gym.,1435276800,,58,2.6875
3788875,5,B001TC8PNM,I love Suzanne Bowen!!!,1432684800,,23,5.0
3788876,3,B001TC8PNM,"It's ok. You feel the workout, but her other workout dvd's are much better. It was a little outdated too.",1432339200,,105,4.3
3788877,5,B001TC8PNM,"I have bought about 12 workout videos since being pregnant. I had a really difficult time finding workouts that were challenging enough since there weren't may reviews online, so here is my review. I hope you find it helpful!

Pre-pregnancy I ran around 20 miles a week, and did an addition 2-4 strength days a week. I am very active and in good shape. However, After my first two months of pregnancy I couldn't run anymore, so I started looking for ways to build muscle safely and effectively as well as find alternative cardio routines. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and can still perform all of these videos. I have seen muscle gain (as has my husband and mid-wives who compliment how well I've stayed in shape!), and I can't wait until I loose this bit of baby fat to really see the definition! The following are my favorite 4 videos that I really found challenging and effective, as well as great for times I have had more or less energy throughout pregnancy. They have really helped keep me in shape when I couldn't run or do military-like workouts anymore!

1. Fit+Sleek Prenatal Physique with Leah Sarago. Moderate/difficult. The weight portions allow you to add additional weight so you can continue to challenge yourself. Easy to mix and match and repeat sections for more reps. My favorite on this video is the upper body and ab portions. I usually do two workouts twice per per day when doing this video. The lower body is also very good. It's also a nice video for when you don't have a lot of time or energy to have the option of doing a 15-30 minute workout since each section is just 15 minutes. Has a good workout suggestion guide. Also, the pre-natal stretch is AMAZING!

2. Expecting More with Sara Haley: Moderate/Difficult. Okay, so this one I have mixed feelings. Over all, I do love it since the workouts are longer (Around an hour, depending) and they are very effective. She just kind of gets on my nerves sometimes with her silly dance moves and the tone she uses. You do have to be careful and be sure to follow moderation's if you aren't as fit--some of the jumping and twisting around can be scary if you don't know how to do it right. She is good at her instructions and making sure you and baby stay safe. Over all, some of these are very challenging, and some are easier. I love the cardio portions, though her strength portions are great, and you will want bumb-bells. Also is a fun video if you like to dance!

3. Long and Lean prenatal Workout with Suzanne Bowen: Easy/Moderate. This was one of my first prenatal videos, and still one of my favorites. I do this one on the days where I have no energy. It does a good job working shoulders and your lower body groups. In the past couple months I have added light weights (3-5lbs) to some of the arm and squat portions to challenge myself more. There is no cardio, really, but is a nice, effective Pilates style workout. My sister, who is a Marine, did this one with me some months after having her 3rd child and felt a little sore the next day. This is one that will def get easier pretty quick if you are moderately to in good shape. But it is effective enough, and more relaxing on those super sleepy, growing a baby days :)

4. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben. Moderate/Difficult. LOVE this workout! Karyne is a world class athlete and this video shows that. This chick is buff! I have been doing this video for about 6 months, and still find it a little challenging. She covers all main muscle groups, lower body, abs, back, side-body, in very safe and effective ways. I do feel most of the focus is in the upper back and arms, so you will def be feeling this the next day! You will want dumb-bells this one. This video is a bit relaxing in style, and it is a bit on the old fashion side (as far as music and quality), but it is really great and one of my favorites.

All of these videos have great stretch portions that I feel are very effective in getting baby where he/she needs to be for delivery, and really helps get your body get into optimal shape for delivery as well. Like I said, my mid-wives have complimented me on how well I have stayed in shape, and my husband has taken lots of notice, too. He thinks I have more muscle on me now than I did pre-pregnancy! I do these videos about 5 times a week and have felt healthy and good throughout my pregnancy. I hope my review helps you!",1432339200,168,4393,4.397293972939729
3788878,5,B001TC8PNM,By far my favorite prenatal DVD!,1431129600,,32,4.5
3788879,5,B001TC8PNM,"I am 23 weeks pregnant and I do this workout roughly three times a week (I also have a stationary bike I use at home on different days). I can honestly say that this workout gets me sweating real quick. Lol Before I got pregnant I was doing a lot of P90X3, so I was really quite fit. As soon as I got pregnant, I fell off the working out bandwagon for the first few months (darn fatigue and nausea!). After getting this workout by Susan Bowen, I can honestly feel my muscles toning up, and I can feel myself getting stronger each and every time I do this workout. When I first started doing this workout, I could barely do just three pushups on my knees. Now I can do the full amount that are in this workout. I'm still a bit chunkier than I'd like to be, but I can't seem to stop giving in to my pregnancy cravings. If I actually had self control and ate right while doing this workout, I'd probably look much more toned. Either way, this workout keeps me grounded and comfortable. I love the stretching segment. It really relaxes me and soothes my back and leg pains. Definitely recommend this workout!!",1429747200,4,1105,4.291866028708134
3788880,1,B001TC8PNM,Rarely do I NOT like a workout video. I majored in fitness so I love to do everything. But I HATED this workout. Have you ever taken a Barre class? Basically its pulsing small movements. Thats it. So this video is about going into a basic yoga pose and pulsing back and forth 10 times. And then repeat. And then repeat again. And repeat for the third time. It reminds me of my moms 1970s workout records. Thats rightrecords. The movements are hard on the hip flexors so if you have tight hip flexors I would for sure skip this. If you want a good workout I would for sure skip this. If you want a boring Barre inspired workout that is basic and monotonous then this is the workout for you. I cant believe how much I hated this workout.,1428537600,,735,4.219858156028369
3788901,3,B001TC8PNM,It is harder than I would like to do while pregnant.  But it is better than the other prenatal yogas that are too easy.,1428019200,,119,3.9583333333333335
3788902,5,B001TC8PNM,I use this workout video when I was pregnant with my son in conjunction with her other video (Slim and Toned Prenatal Barre).  Excellent workout!!,1427500800,,146,4.84
3788903,4,B001TC8PNM,"This CD is not too bad. A little boring, but not too bad for stretching while pregnant.",1427155200,,87,4.176470588235294
3788904,5,B001TC8PNM,Great workout! I could definetely feel the burn in my legs and arms. I would even do this workout not pregnant.,1426809600,,111,4.333333333333333
3788905,3,B001TC8PNM,"It's a pretty gentle workout, but I agree with the other reviewers that the stretching segment is the best part and well worth the price of the DVD alone.",1425945600,,154,4.344827586206897
3788906,5,B001TC8PNM,"I love Suzanne Bowen and I love this workout. She has great instruction and is gentle. Its not a ""boot camp"" type of work out,which I never really like anyway. She has great exercises that really work your muscles, if you're doing them correctly. The standing work is my favorite, as I find the mat work tough on my wrists. Very do-able, yet really works you",1425168000,,358,4.4393939393939394
3788907,4,B001TC8PNM,"The only con to this DVD is that it is obvious that it was among the first of Suzanne Bowen's fitness DVDs.  Her Slim & Toned Prenatal is much better and allows for much more flexibility based on fitness/trimester level.

That being said, I still enjoy this workout.  I'm 30 weeks pregnant and can do many of the exercises with a few modifications.  It can get a little tedious doing so many sets of each exercise, but is still a great workout.",1425081600,,444,4.378048780487805
3788908,5,B001TC8PNM,My wife loved this video. She did the morning she gave birth.,1424390400,,61,4.166666666666667
3788909,4,B001TC8PNM,"I am currently 22 weeks along, and I tried it for the first time this weekend.  This really gives you an intense workout!  My husband is in decent shape and works out several times per week.  He joined me, and he found some of the moves to be challenging, such as the diamond push-ups.  In my opinion, the video is a bit high impact for a late second trimester/third trimester mommy.  However, if you are in really great shape to begin with, you may really like this video.  Regardless, Suzanne gives you options to modify as you go along and that may benefit you if you are having a tougher time going through the entire video.",1424131200,,628,4.370689655172414
3788910,4,B001TC8PNM,"This is a good workout DVD but not my absolute favorite.  I am 24 weeks pregnant with my second child, and I am quite picky when it comes to prenatal exercise DVDs--I like a kind but realistic trainer (i.e., the fake, preppy pregnant ladies drive me crazy!), and I like a high intensity workout (at least, ""high intensity"" in the context of pregnancy). I would not say I am incredibly fit, but when I do exercise I want to be challenged! I bought this DVD because I also own Suzanne Bowen's Slim & Toned Prenatal Barre Workout, which I love! Slim & Toned is still my favorite workout, primarily for two reasons. First, I am partial to the barre method. I like how challenging it is, but how safe it feels even during pregnancy. I also own a set of Core Fusion DVDs, and I like to alternate the Slim & Toned workout with some of the Core Fusion segments that seem appropriate for pregnancy. The Long & Lean DVD is good, but it doesn't feel as difficult to me, and I was a little bored with parts of it. Second, I like how the Slim Upper Body & Core section of Slim & Toned uses weights. I only use 3 pound weights for the arm section, but I feel like I get a much better arm workout than I do with the Long & Lean DVD. I'm still glad I own both DVDs, however, if only for the variety provided! And the stretching section at the end of Long & lean is quite thorough and helpful for the lower back pain I've been experiencing lately.",1423612800,,1430,4.181159420289855
3788921,5,B001TC8PNM,Great Video!,1422662400,,12,5.5
3788922,2,B001TC8PNM,If you need someone to tell you to do a bunch of lunges and push-ups then by all means buy this dvd. I was extremely disappointed with this workout. There was no originality and seemed to be very little thought put into making this workout. Look I'm really not that picky but doing three sets of the same exercise is boring. Honestly I was only able to get through about 25 minutes of the dvd. I wanted to try to give it a chance and finish it but I just couldn't. I could just watched a tv show and done some lunges and it would have been much more entertaining.  I gave it two starts because I did sweat and there is a workout to be had if you like boring repetitive movements. I think I am just going to take my dog for a walk instead of finishing this.,1422576000,2,756,4.04
3788923,5,B001TC8PNM,"Yes! You should definitely own this DVD if you are expecting. I was able to break a little sweat too, but not too much. *Stay Hydrated Ladies!
I worked out alot before pregnancy. I wanted to keep that going with something that was especially for pregnancy. As an added bonus, there is
a great 10-15 minute POSTNATAL abs workout at the end of the DVD! When your Dr. or Midwife give you the okay to start exercising again...DO IT! I had no idea how much abdominal strength we lose after pregnancy due to them separating. I tried doing my regular stuff I did before like planks and other exercises, but it was really painful and difficult. I needed something specifically for Postnatal Abs and this DVD helped me, A LOT! Most all be gentle with yourself and go slowly, but Go. You are either preparing to birth life or just have and that is Major so listen to your body.
Many Blessings!",1421971200,,883,4.45679012345679
3788924,5,B001TC8PNM,"I did this video 3 days/week from week 24-40.  I really thing the sideway lunges and leg lifts kept me from having hip pain during pregnancy.  I don't like that there is not really an instructor, but go to know the video so well, I played my own music!",1421193600,,252,4.122448979591836
3788925,3,B001TC8PNM,It becomes a challenge the farther into pregnancy you get and most new moms may not be excited about such strength enduring exercises. I thought it would be more like yoga because that is what I searched to find this but the only stretching is in the end so I was a little disappointed. Also the picture on the cover shows her outside but the whole thing takes place in a studio - also not a big fan of her voice. Maybe I will try it again postpartum.,1421020800,,451,4.136363636363637
3788926,5,B001TC8PNM,Definitely one of the best prenatal workouts I have found.  As someone who worked out regularly before my pregnancy I have had a hard time finding a workout that challenges me.  I highly recommend Suzanne Bowen's prenatal workouts for anyone who is looking for a more challenging prenatal workout.  The barre method definitely lengthens and tones - I even think my legs are going to be in better shape postnatal ;),1420675200,,414,4.802816901408451
3788927,4,B001TC8PNM,"I am in my second trimester (20 weeks) and was in very good shape pre-pregnancy (HIIT, circuit training, heavy weights, and cardio working out 6 days a week and was looking for a nice flow I could do as I begin slowing down and getting bigger. This video fits the bill; it is not strenuous, but it is a nice, gentle workout that requires no fancy equipment and helps me loosen tight muscles. She has a pleasant enough voice that you have the option to turn off and just do the workout with the music. It moves slowly enough that you are never rushing to different moves (nice if like me you are working out with two little toddlers running around your feet). She hits arms, legs, back, chest, shoulders, chest, core, and butt through various modifications of Pilates and dance conditioning movements. This is not a workout I would want to do every day, but it is a nice break to do once a week in conjunction with cardio and weights. I think this will be a nice workout for immediately postpartum as well.

3788944,5,B001TC8PNM,I love this DVD.  It does just enough to get my heart rate up and work my muscles without being over the top.  The video does move through the moves pretty quickly so it took me a couple times to feel confident with everything.  I plan on continuing this DVD through my pregnancy.,1414713600,,280,4.245283018867925
3788945,5,B001TC8PNM,"I absolutely love this workout. When I originally ordered it, I assumed it would be more of a relaxing yoga workout for stretching. Much to my pleasant surprise, instead it is a challenging prenatal workout with moves that get your heart rate up without being too difficult on your body. She uses a combination of yoga, pilates, and dance moves to keep the exercises fresh. I love that most of the moves work more than one part of the body, so you are making the most of your time. Even though the moves are tough, you are also stretching and moving in ways that feel good during pregnancy. I have lots of hip and back pain, but this video does not aggravate those areas at all. The stretching segment at the end is a great way to finish! Suzanne is a great instructor without too much talking during the workout so you can enjoy it and focus on your body. I highly recommend this video.",1414627200,2,887,4.381818181818182

I was pretty active prior to pregnancy, but had never done any pilates before. I LOVE THIS WORKOUT! It gets my heart rate up, works my muscles (I have maintained my tone while gaining pregnancy weight) and also has great stretching at the end, which I think has helped fend off back pain. I do this workout 2-3 times per week, and alternate with The Perfect Pregnancy Workout (vol 1). Love it. This is my favorite workout of the two and I will definitely check out more of her videos for when I'm postpartum. I'm 28 weeks now and can still do all the exercises, so I'm pretty sure I'll be able to do it until the end. I would highly recommend this video for anyone who wants to maintain their fitness level during pregnancy.

I was kinda nervous to try because of price but it was well well worth it.  The stretching part is also great it really does a great job of hitting every muscle group.  The standing and sitting parts of the work out really are also a great way to stay fit.  I even feel like I have a tiny bit of a waste left because of some of these moves.  If its too much all at once (which I am finding toward the end here) you can just do the standing or sitting with the stretching but for the beginning of pregnancy I really enjoyed doing all of it I felt so great afterward.,1408320000,,715,3.972027972027972

The workout itself is pretty great. The girl isn't annoying and the pace isn't boring, as most girly workouts tend to be. The exercises aren't just about getting a workout, but they actually focus on the muscles that you're going to be using to prepare for birth and to go through the laboring process itself. That's really what I was looking for in a workout and she delivers. Great little investment! This paired with swimming and my Maternal Fitness book stretches are really all I need.",1385769600,,736,4.6183206106870225

3788969,5,B001TC8PNM,"I bought this DVD along with the Slim and Toned Barre workout from Suzanne Bowen.  I am a marathon runner, but I got out of shape during the first trimester due to nausea and fatigue.  Now that I'm in the second trimester, my regular routine of running and high impact cardio are not an option, so I was looking to workout DVDs to help expand my exercise options beyond walking and elliptical machines.  I am pleased with both DVDs.  Long and Lean is a good compact workout-- more focused on isolating the muscles and working on toning than cardio based exercises.  I got warm, but didn't really sweat.  The Slim and Toned Barre workout was longer and felt more rigorous, but I think both have their place in my regular routine.  Especially since Long and Lean is 50 minutes long, including the stretching portion (whereas Slim and Toned Barre is closer to 70 minutes if you do all the workouts at once).  Long and Lean also has a post-natal workout section.  I also have Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga from Gaiam, and I feel the three DVDs are a well rounded collection.",1383609600,2,1066,4.539267015706806

3788976,5,B001TC8PNM,"I really love this workout video.  It is a pretty tough workout.  I am a runner and triathlete and although I have been able to run throughout my pregnancy I was looking for some other things to incorporate into my routine since summer heat has forced me to cut back my mileage somewhat.

I really enjoy the fact that this video incorporates strength work with cardio.  And the stretching portion at the end has become my go-to stretching routine.  I love it so much I do it after my other prenatal workout videos and also after running, and on days off.  Great hip openers for the pregnant athlete!  I also love the standing ab work.

My only complaint (relatively minor) is that Suzanne is pretty small (early second trimester?) in this video and as my belly has gotten bigger I find it getting in the way of some of the exercises.  It would be better if she had done this video with another person later in her pregnancy so you could see better modifications to certain moves.",1377561600,,979,4.4858757062146895
3788977,5,B001TC8PNM,"What I love most about this is that it is clearly based from dance moves (plies, leg extensions etc) combined with more traditional workout and yoga moves (lunges, squats, plank).  It is a true fusion of types that gives me a peaceful, yet invigorating workout during pregnancy.  I barely break a sweat, but the workout feels good.  This is not an intense cardio workout, and I don't get as sore as I would from a more standard weight-bearing workout or circuit training.  But, during pregnancy, I wanted something with lower intensity, and this fits the bill.  As a former ballet dancer who enjoys yoga/stretching as well, I especially like the standing floor work and the stretching session at the end.",1376352000,,704,4.833333333333333

3788979,5,B001TC8PNM,"I got this DVD after reading countless reviews on Amazon to narrow it down and I am so happy I purchased this disc! I was 3 months pregnant when I got it, and I am now 17 weeks and I still use it twice a week (I alternate it with just cardio days and of course days off when I'm too pooped to move). I agree that it is tough on the shoulders, I still can't get through the standing routine without dropping my arms a few times, but I definitely see & feel overall improvement and the push-ups are no problem for me now after one month (I did them before pregnancy regularly but not at all the first trimester).
Before baby, I worked out 5 times a week, and I would say I am relatively fit: I mix up my workouts between light running, cardio tapes like Insanity, and lifting at the gym. During the 1st trimester, I was exhausted (but not nauseous) so I continued working out, just cut back on the intensity of everything and only did low-impact exercises. I have more energy now in Tri-2, and this workout makes me lightly break a sweat and you can feel your muscles tighter afterwards, which is a good feeling. My clothes still fit (except for waistbands) and I still have muscle tone, and I credit this tape with a lot of that. The other days, I do cardio like walking up and down stairs for 20 min or the elliptical just to sweat, and I'm happy with this routine. I definitely recommend this DVD and will actually give it to some friends to try who aren't pregnant but not big into exercising, this is a great all-around workout!

She really targets some tough muscles.  There is 20 minutes of standing work, 20 minutes of floor work and 10 minutes of stretching.

3788988,3,B001TC8PNM,"Overall, this DVD does provide a decent workout.  Your heart rate will elevate and there are some challenging exercises.  I just felt there were some really awkward positions that were really uncomfortable.  There are many times in the DVD where only one foot is on tip toes and the other is flat, and you're supposed to do various exercises that way.  It just felt strange.  There were also instances in the DVD where she forgets to do the other side completely.  I know we all have pregnancy brain... but really?  It just made the production value feel really low.

This is also more of a personal preference, but I did not like how she did NOT explain what each exercise was meant to do, how it was supposed to feel, or give any corrections so you know you are doing it right.  Exercise is good for you, but if done in the wrong position or posture, you can really injure yourself; and in this case, there was no guidance on what position you really should be in and where you should be really feeling it so you know you're doing it right.

Another gripe of mine is how she couldn't simply say ""right arm/leg"" or ""left arm/leg.""  Instead, because she is perpendicular to the screen, she references each limb as ""front arm/leg"" and ""back arm/leg.""  But because I do the DVD while facing the TV, I don't have a ""front arm/leg"" or a ""back arm/leg"" and after a while, it got confusing as to which side I was supposed to be working.

Overall it is a decent workout, but I didn't love it and probably won't do it every day.
For reference:  I am fairly active and exercise 3-5 days a week, alternating between running, yoga and barre.",1367539200,,1630,4.426174496644295

1. It doesn't ""baby"" you just because you're pregnant. I was actually sweating and felt sore the next day. Many prenatal workouts are too easy. We're pregnant, not disabled :)
2. It was broken down into 3 segments, which kept it fast paced. For an hour-long workout, that is a key element for me.
3. I have done barre before, and I liked her variations. Felt fresh.
4. It wasn't so difficult that I felt I was putting myself or my baby at risk. I did not work out AT ALL for the first 20 weeks due to horrible 24-hour morning sickness, but I still felt able to complete this workout with no worries now that I'm feeling better.

However, I do want to add three ""caveats"" to my otherwise 5-star review:

1. Suzanne looks clearly pregnant on the cover, but not so in the workout. Not sure why? Also, the woman doing the abs segment at the end (I don't think it was the same person) was also not pregnant or at least not showing. For this reason, I don't feel that adjustments for growing bellies were addressed. I'm already pretty large at now 22 weeks, and I had to make my own adjustments. I just used common sense, but having another model with Suzanne who was further along would have been helpful.

2. I did not like the placement of the abs workout, which is put in after a very long rest and relaxation period. This made zero sense to me. Who wants to open their eyes after cooling down for several minutes to do abs?

3. As for the ab workout itself, I think someone needs to point out that many of the exercises are done entirely on your back, which I've been told is a no-no when you're with child. So in the end, the odd placement of the ab section, the lack of addressing the flat-on-my-back element, and the fact that the woman doing the abs looked to almost have a concave (definitely not very pregnant, if at all) belly caused the loss of a star.

But if you love barre workouts with no equipment (another bonus), then this DVD is really great!!",1362614400,18,2011,4.335106382978723
3788995,3,B001TC8PNM,"I am doing it now for 3 month, and I am in the beginning of 3rd trimester. I love stretching part and standing workout, however I can't do floor workout it's very difficult, and even modifications do not help. If you have weak arms know that one part of this DVD won't be for you. Another minor thing, I like to hear instructions and turn of music but unfortunately this option doesn't exist. Another issue that i have with this workout, it doesn't alternate sides often enough and as a result i get numb. All this issues are fixable and would can be worked around. Other than that it's great workout which helps me stay fit and healthy.",1362009600,2,637,4.406779661016949
3788996,5,B001TC8PNM,"I love this.  It works you out so that you really feel like you accomplished something, not too easy which is what I found with most prenatal workout dvds.  I did this all the way through 9 months of pregnancy, just did things more slowly or less repetitions toward the end.  My sister, who isn't preg. and does tons of workout dvds loved it too!  I really like the tone of it--the woman is relaxing to watch and listen to.",1361836800,,423,4.25

3788998,4,B001TC8PNM,"I like this dvd for some pretty basic reasons:
1. It gets my heart rate up, but not too much. I had been running up to about 6 weeks, when I really started to feel sick. By the time I was feeling well again, I had lost my running mojo and didn't want to push it too hard. This is just right.
2. She doesn't have the whole ""your body is a temple/fruit of thy womb"" thing going on. She's straight forward and has good alternatives.
3. It's not too terribly long.

I recommend this, for sure. I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I don't LOVE it.",1360713600,,546,4.009174311926605
3788999,5,B001TC8PNM,"I have purchased several prenatal workout DVDs and so far this one is my favorite! The transitions between movements are so smooth and gentle and yet it is a great workout! There are three sections: standing (20 minutes), mat (20 minutes), and stretching (10 minutes). The first time I did it I only did the standing and stretching and it was wonderful. I think I may do the stretching portion every day because it was so effective and relaxing.

One of my favorite things about this DVD is how down to earth and simple it is. The set and music are not distracting and are actually quite relaxing in spite of the fact that you are feeling the burn!

I will report back on how this compares to some of the other workouts I haven't done yet, but so far I love this one!",1358899200,,767,4.319444444444445

3789002,4,B001TC8PNM,"First let me say that even though my screen name is Darrell, I'm a lady :p

This DVD is great if you maintained at least some level of fitness pre-pregnancy. If this is your first time attempting to do anything physical, maybe look somewhere else. That being said, the workouts included certainly get your heart pumping, and they aren't unsafe as some other reviewers have stated. They're squats and push-ups, people. However, if you're in your late 2nd trimester, or beyond, this DVD is probably not one you want to purchase. You'll be stuck with only the first workout, and maybe some of the second. Suzanne wasn't very far along when she made this so she has quite a bit more room to move/bend/whatever. The first move on the ""relaxation"" bit is to basically lay across your thighs, which at this point is physically impossible for me (31 weeks). So yeah, consider that.",1358208000,,873,4.705882352941177
3789003,5,B001TC8PNM,"This is one of my two favorite prego workout videos ever. It's calming, not cheesy, and challenging. Once, I invited two non-pregnant, young and relatively fit friends to do this with me and they found it challenging, as well. I'd say it's best suited to those who are physically fit and already doing a moderate workout when they conceive. I was running 3-5 miles a few times a wk, so this kept my pace well. I didn't do it in the third trimester, choosing instead to use the Summer Sander's Prenatal Workout. Summer Sander's prenatal workout has three levels of challenge, one for each trimester. I used the Long and Lean alternately with Summer Sander's workout until the third trimester, when I mostly stuck to the latter.",1358035200,,726,4.724409448818897
3789004,4,B001TC8PNM,"I liked this DVD. It moved pretty quickly, although there is one part at the beginning that is pretty repetitious, and I was worried at that point that I might not like the DVD for that reason. It did get better after that, though.

In my opinion, it's fairly intense for a prenatal workout. I'm not 100% sure that all of the activities are appropriate in pregnancy, so I just use my gut instinct and skip the ones that don't feel comfortable or don't look possible for me. It's a lot of strength and stretching, mostly. It's not cardio, although you do move around a fair amount.

All in all, I liked this DVD. I felt a nice sense of accomplishment after I finished it, since it is a little more intense than my prenatal yoga DVD. If you haven't been very active and haven't exercised a lot pre-pregnancy, I wouldn't recommend starting here. This is probably a better fit for women who do zumba, run, dance, etc. on a regular basis.

The other thing that I liked about this DVD is that the lady on the screen was obviously working hard too. It wasn't too easier for her, either!",1357516800,,1079,4.385
3789005,4,B001TC8PNM,"This workout looks deceptively easy, but it is actually pretty challenging. All of the moves are low-impact and very easy on your joints. It can get a little bit boring over time, but if you mix it up with other workouts throughout the week you won't get tired of it so quickly. Great toning moves and I love the extra time that they put into stretching at the end. A lot of workouts rush through the stretching portions, but you really need to focus on stretching especially when you are pregnant. I don't particularly like the setting, which is some sort of boring stage. But the music is pleasant and uplifting and helps make up for the lack of scenery. I keep coming back to this DVD when my joints are feeling sore and I need a good low-impact workout.",1357084800,2,757,4.414285714285715

3789009,4,B001TC8PNM,"I started doing this workout video yesterday. It kicked my butt!!!! And I don't think it's because of the baby belly. More arms than I think is needed and rather have a little more legs but this was a challenge for sure. And it wasn't super annoying.
I was a dancer, I've done yoga and was a pilates instructor. The moves pull from all of these elements. I am not sure if it is better to have knowledge of any of those prior to doing this video. I thought it might be but she uses very good descriptive words to get you doing the right thing and into the correct positions.
It's great to have the music only option. After doing any workout video more than 5 times you pretty much know the moves and just want something to kinda go along with minus the instruction.
I actually think this would be a challenge for me prior to pregnancy and I was doing 3K runs before recently. Again there is a little too much focus on the arms. From many people I heard that legs are really what get you through labor along with kegal and core. But it is nice to have shapely arms throughout pregnancy. And it will come in handy lugging all that bag stuff around.
I do suggest you be in somewhat good physical shape if you get this video and even if you are in great shape to heed her warnings to not over stretch or over do anything and take breaks if needed. Always listen to your body.
I can see this won't be for everyone but it certainly is for me. I loved it and will continue this after baby which is great because I certainly feel it was worth the money.",1354579200,,1544,4.167224080267559

The only problem I have is finding motivation to actually press play. The workouts are effective and will make your muscles tremble! Haha I consider myself pretty fit and regularly active.. The exercise itself isn't too difficult.. It's the number of reps you gotta keep up with that gets your heart rate going. I was happy my muscles were tight the next day since it showed my productiveness haha.,1353974400,,553,4.711340206185567

While this is a totally doable work out. I wasn't much of a fan because with how sick I've been during my pregnancy I didn't have the motivation to do such a hard work out.

Eventually, I realized I would need something a little less intense, but I wanted to make sure I kept up a certain level of fitness. I found this workout to be a great addition to my routine, though it is a little longer than I was used to committing.  I also used a kettle bell pregnancy DVD and the Perfect Pregnancy Workout, which are more intense than this one.  Now that I am about six weeks post-partum, I am using it to ease back into a workout routine.",1352246400,,598,4.321428571428571
3789015,3,B001TC8PNM,"Many of the reviews say that this is an intense workout.  I highly disagree.  This is my second pregnancy.  As with my first pregnancy, I have been very active all along.  I was riding and jumping horses until 27 weeks, I still run on the elliptical, and up until last week I had been doing my Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and Yoga Meltdown DVD workouts.  At 32 weeks, my belly is getting to the point where I can't do some of the poses in the Jillian Michaels DVDs, so I reluctantly switched over to this DVD.  It is not challenging at all!  The exercises are boring, and I didn't even break a sweat.  I might have to switch back to my tried and true Jillian DVDs and just skip the parts that I find uncomfortable.

I suppose that this would be a good workout for someone who is not in good shape going into pregnancy and who does not stay active.",1351209600,2,849,4.191358024691358

Then, I switched to the Long & Lean Prenatal dvd.  It is a great workout!  It is challenging, but also relaxing.  It safely works the abdominal muscles & helped me stay strong & fit while pregnant.  After my baby was born, my abs were still strong & my body bounced back quickly.  I really think this dvd had so much to do with that.",1350604800,4,490,3.9896907216494846
3789017,5,B001TC8PNM,"I purchased this Long and Lean DVD as well as the 10 Minute Solution - Prenatal Pilates by Lizbeth Garcia.  I have to say, I'm very happy with both.

When I was reading other reviews, I found it helpful to know what the writer's fitness level was before pregnancy.  I was fairly active - doing a combination of running, Insanity and P90X dvd's about 4 or 5 times a week.  When I got pregnant, I continued running until I was about 4-5 months along.  At that point, I was just too uncomfortable to do something that strenuous.

This is my third pregnancy.  With my other 2 pregnancies I tried other prenatal tapes and was mostly disappointed.  They were more cardio based and I felt like I was an old lady doing some of the routines.  They weren't that challenging and didn't really make me feel like I was staying in shape.  I have been impressed with the Suzanne Bowen and Lizbeth Garcia videos.  First of all, I think they both have helped me with the normal aches and pains of pregnancy - specifically hip and back pain.  Second, they can be challenging if you want them to be (in the Garcia video - you can use heavier weights if you want).  But I feel like as I get closer to my due date (10 weeks away now), I can ease up a little/modify and still get a good workout.

Bowen's routine is a little harder but you get used to it.  I like Garcia's 10 min. routines because there are days where I just don't have time for a full workout.

Bottom line is that I like both of them more than cardio workouts I've purchased.  I feel like I'm getting a good workout but not over/under doing it.  And, I still recognize my body.  My arms and legs still have some tone to them and are not nearly as big as they were with my other pregnancies when I was doing prenatal cardio tapes.  I think they are both good buys.

If you're hesitant to purchase, I know you can find some of the Garcia prenatal pilates workouts on Utube.  You can try them out there before purchasing the actual dvd.",1348617600,3,1980,4.266129032258065
3789018,4,B001TC8PNM,"This is a great video. I was looking for a moderately challenging Yoga DVD but I couldn't seem to find anything in the intermediate range with decent reviews so I bought this instead. This is a Pilates based workout broken into two sections- standing and floor work. Both sections are challenging and yet I've never felt any discomfort. I knocked a star off the rating because they don't give you any time to breathe or drink water! I end up abandoning the video for a minute to drink or catch my breath. Even the ""rest"" times between push up sequences where you go into child's pose are only half a breath long! (I cheat and stay there longer and do some Kegels so I don't feel so bad) The stretching and relaxation section at the end is very nice.

3789020,3,B001TC8PNM,"Before pregnancy, I was a big fan of Suzanne Bowen's Slim & Sculpt pilates video for the 10-minute series, which I find efficient, fast-paced, well-instructed, and fun to do. Her Long & Lean prenatal workout is not quite up to that level. While the exercises are for the most part well-designed, with an emphasis on pilates-style controlled movements, I find the overall workout repetitive and boring and the tinkly piano music not particularly invigorating.
The 45-minute workout is composed of three sections.
(1) Standing exercises: squats and lunges combined with arm and upper body strengthening work. Each major set of exercises is performed three times on each side of the body. It can get challenging, but unfortunately it can also get boring.
(2) Floor work: push-ups (a lot), pilates leg-work, some exercise of the obliques, hamstrings and glutes. This section is pleasantly challenging and carefully designed not to put you on your back.
(3) Stretching & relaxation: This is a whole-body stretching routine with an emphasis on hips, legs and back. However, some of the positions are becoming more difficult as my belly swells up.
Bowen has hardly started to show in this video, at maybe about four or five months. Perhaps that's why she doesn't give much advice on modifying, other than to listen to your body and stop when you need to. Even the very first warm-up, which involves bringing your knees up and swinging your arms, might be affected by a big belly, since you might want to bring your knees lower or to the sides. Some of the stretches she does simply don't seem possible with a big belly. This is important to me already in my second trimester, because I'm very petite and so my belly is already enormous in relation to the rest of my body.
I find I greatly prefer Summer Sanders's Prenatal Workout, which I've been doing three or four times a week, and which provides routines for each trimester and plenty of advice on how to modify and when to take it easy, with designated times for water breaks. I like Bowen's pilates approach, but I don't find this workout much fun.",1345766400,16,2097,4.811634349030471

I was not able to do the whole workout right away (lack of energy in 1st tri), while she did her third set I would rest and get water and hop back in when I was ready. I also like that the workouts were split up into standing, mat and stretching so depending on how I was feeling that day I picked what I could handle. By my second trimester I could do both workouts without stopping to much. The standing workout is a great workout really gets the heart pumping and I can feel my legs getting stronger. I also liked the mat workout because it was well rounded and got a lot of different parts or the body. I never felt like it was hurting me or the baby but I didn't kill myself to get through it the first time around either, like anything else you do what you can and built on it.",1330128000,,808,4.024844720496894

3789038,3,B001TC8PNM,"Of the six pre-natal DVDs I own, this one is the hardest. The only thing that saves this from being an intermediate-advanced workout by non-pregnant standards is the reasonable number of reps. I can't see feeling comfortable doing this past 7 months pregnant. It's also a bit annoying how Suzanne doesn't really acknowledge fully the challenges of working out while pregnant (every other DVD I own does), but this is more of a psychological perk! :) That said, I will continue to work with this one because it seems very effective but is at the upper limit of what I am comfortable doing pregnant. I'm definitely not out of shape, more of an intermediate exerciser in general. I just want to stay in reasonable shape while pregnant, not get in the best shape of my life. Obviously, if you are looking for a real challenge or are more of an advanced exerciser- it's great.",1326931200,3,871,4.662337662337662

I hope I will be able to use this program all throughout my pregnancy but it might be a little too difficult towards the end.

Based on the reviews for this DVD, I went ahead and ordered it and, even though I generally haven't done a pilates inspired workout before, I found that this really gave me a good workout and was pretty tough!  I have to admit I've only done the standing and the floor workouts, because I only have about 40 minutes in the morning before work.  I'm currently in the 25th week of my pregnancy, and am finding myself more achey so I will also be adding more yoga, stretching, and relaxation to my workouts, and am happy to know that this DVD will fit in as I modify my workout regime.",1325635200,,789,4.281879194630872

I'm at the end of my second trimester during my second pregnancy, and I needed something that I could do at home during any spare moments or while my son naps. I love that it's broken into two 20-minute segments that target all major muscle groups and incorporate cardiovascular work. The stretching segment is pretty legit also. I'm so happy to have found something that makes me feel like I'm staying in shape without requiring a huge time commitment!  My only problem with this video is the amount of time spent on hands and knees during the mat segment - it's very hard on my wrists, which I know is a common complaint during pregnancy. I just modify those few minutes as much as possible.",1323734400,,849,4.5855263157894735

If you're new to working out you may have to stop and take small breaks.  Overall, I'd say it's a great way to start working out for the first time in your pregnancy. It doesn't get you tired to the point you feel unsafe if you go along with the instructor to the end.  The exercises are short enough not to bore or exhaust you. I definitely recommend it.",1322870400,,469,4.318181818181818

After reading reviews, I bought this one and absolutely love it!!! Typically I am not into workout videos and would prefer to go to the gym, but this is so great for pregnancy that I have no problem doing it multiple times a week. Suzanne does great, challenging exercises that work really well no matter what trimester you're in, and are great for strengthening and stretching. Also, the music is great, and there is this wonderful relaxation part at the end. This DVD is going to be instrumental in keeping me fit all during my pregnancy!

I have to say though I'm disappointed that the instructor does not even look pregnant in the workout (not at all like she looks on the cover).  It may sound silly, but as I've gotten farther along in my pregnancy and done this workout, I have to wonder if she would modify any of the positions to accommodate a growing belly.  This is a decent workout for 1st and 2nd trimester, but I am not enjoying it as much in my 3rd trimester (and I'll admit maybe it's because I'm a little jealous of how normal her body shape still is).  I much more enjoy the Summer Sanders' prenatal workout to this at this stage.",1320883200,4,707,4.333333333333333
3789046,4,B001TC8PNM,"*disclaimer- i just received this and have only done the floor routine so this review is only pertaining to the floor part.  I may add another review after I tackle the mat exercises*

I normally run, lift weights, swim, and enjoy martial arts before I got pregnant.  Not a ""pro"" by any stretch of the imagination, I do consider myself in fairly good shape and have done a wide variety of exercises.  When I started to slow down b/c of the pregnancy, I wanted something challenging to maintain my physical fitness.  A lot of the other exercise programs I looked at seemed ""slow"" and boring (yes, yes, I know yoga can be tough, but I like dynamic exercise).

I read the reviews of this video, I thought it would more difficult than what I found it to be.  I've never been big into aerobics or video or instructional exercises, so I had to get used to feeling ""silly"" doing some of the floor moves.

I generally avoid lunges and squats in the gym but i don't mind doing them under own body weight.  The incorporation of the arms into all of the movements are good, definitely felt the burn after holding arms out for the entire routine.

I don't know if the floor exercises will be challenging enough for me.  I think after a week, I will try to add some light arm weights.  Also, I can see myself getting bored of the same 20 minute routine, so I will probably use this only 2 or 3 times a week.

Overall, I like the exercises and think they will provide good variety.  To increase difficulty I would recommend doing the floor routine twice and/or adding light (2 lbs) arm weights.  I wish there was more than 1x 20 minute floor routine.",1320019200,,1636,4.3887043189368775
3789047,3,B001TC8PNM,"This video does give you a good workout, but it is not very interesting.  If you like repetition it may be for you.  But, if you like variety you may find it boring.  I used this once so far and will probably only use it rarely-or perhaps give it away.",1317081600,,252,4.0

This dvd was perfect for me...I could even just do the standing segment if that's all I had time for and feet ""worked out"" :) Our 2nd is 4mon. old now, and I am getting back into doing the standing workout along with the post partum ab section, which is great...I was definitely sore, but in a good way!

3789049,5,B001TC8PNM,"I have watched several prenatal yoga and pilates DVDs in the past but this one by far is the best in that it actually makes you sweat!  It seems like most prenatal DVDs focus on relaxation and stretching whereas this one helps you work on strengthening your body.  It includes quite a few ab exercises as well, which I love.  The first 20 minutes is standing work, the second is floor work, followed by 10-minute relaxation.  The stretching exercises in the relaxation phase are great - I love the soothing music as well.

One reviewer said it was too hard.  I was jogging 3 miles a day but still found it impossible to keep up with the DVD in the beginning, I was able to do only a third of it, with lots of breaks in between.  But I've stuck to it for 3 months and I'm now able to follow the entire program without stopping. I'm 35 weeks pregnant.

The only thing is that there are a few stretching poses that I just can't do now that my belly is big.  And there're no modifications mentioned for them.  Other than that, I'm totally in love with this DVD and would highly recommend it to anyone.",1316649600,2,1097,4.281553398058253

It's got three segments:  20 min. standing workout, 20 min. floor workout, and 10 min. stretching.  The standing and floor pilates segments will definitely tone your legs and glutes (I've been doing it for 6 weeks and can see the results), but it's my arms that are usually burning so much that I need to rest them before continuing.  The stretching portion is INCREDIBLE, no weak stretches here.

3789054,4,B001TC8PNM,"This is the 1st prenatal workout I did, and it remains one of my favorite/top 3! After not having exercised for 2 weeks, I was quite nervous about starting back, but I said ""what the heck"" and worked out with this anyway, initially thinking it was going to be a nice relaxing yoga workout. Let me say right now, IT'S NOT! What this is is a barre, Pilates and yoga inspired workout. I mostly got the barre, as it turns out Suzanne is a former instructor of the Lotte Berk Method, then went on to create her own interpretation, of which there are many, the most famous being Burr Leonard's Bar Method, and my favorite, Physique 57! I am so happy that this is barre-inspired prenatal fitness as I am a huge follower of barre workouts, having used them to get into ridiculous shape after having tried Bikram yoga and kickboxing: barre works! And this workout is just right: there are no weights, but a lot of bodyweight work, lots of squats too, good for baby! The instruction is well-paced as well, done as a voice-over while Suzanne herself does the workouts in her preggo self. I didn't like the over-long blacked-out relaxation part, though, then afterwards it proceeds to a postnatal abs workout. I was already relaxed, so I didn't want to go to abs, plus if it were just a blacked-out screen, then I can just relax on my own, and not wait for the video to end, only to be surprised with the postnatal segment! Were it up to me, I would do more video stretching, AFTER a prenatal abs segment, and if it's for postnatal, then go back to the main screen to access it, NOT include it in a prenatal segment. Overall, though, this is a fantastic workout, plus if you're traveling, this is easy to bring and do, as you don't need weights, it still gets your blood moving and gives you a good workout: all you need is a yoga mat, not even shoes! Awesome. If this is too easy for you, or want something harder, Bar Method also has a Prenatal video that uses weights and has a lot of painful/difficult legwork using a chair/bar.",1314489600,5,2020,4.418230563002681

3789056,5,B001TC8PNM,"I looked at a lot of different workouts before ordering and I'm so glad that I ordered Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal workout video.  The workouts are broken up into 3 sections so you can choose to do a shortened workout when you don't have time or are just too exhausted.  Standingwork and Matwork (you are not on your back at any time) are both 20 minute sections and Stretching and Relaxation is 10 minutes.  After the workout you feel like you actually did something and you feel more toned, but I don't think the workout is too strenous for pregnancy- I never feel out of breath or like my heart rate is getting too high.  I did pilates sporatically before getting pregnant and wasn't in the best shape but I don't feel pushed too hard during the workout and Suzanne reminds you to make adaptations or take a break if you need to.  I debated about getting this workout because it isn't broken up into different workouts for each trimester, but now that I've done it I feel that it is appropriate throughout pregnancy and adaptations will be easy to make as my belly expands.  I started the workout about a month after I found out I was pregnant (after the nausea stopped!)and it helped me start to feel more energized and relieved some of my muscle pain.  I'm my fourth month now and I plan on using the video to help me stay in shape and relieve tension throughout my pregnancy.",1313452800,,1392,4.456692913385827

I was in pretty good physical condition before and this is still a great workout (especially as you get bigger and bigger).  However, you can tailor it to make it easier as you go through the DVD, so those new to working out should also find this workout useful and doable (though, as always, consult your physician).

It's not going to help you lose weight, but that is not what you should be aiming for while pregnant.  This has some pilates moves, and will overall just help you maintain muscle tone (ie: ""long and lean""), plus I have found it really helps to ease the sciatica issue.  The instructor is great, not annoying or chatty, and you can actually do the workout without the instructions - just music - after you learn it.  It would get boring if you did it daily, so I rotate this with 2 other workout DVDs, as well as swim, walking, and elliptical workouts.",1313020800,,981,4.4525139664804465

I have never done yoga before so I was worried about purchasing a yoga video that would be too tough. Let me say, that I LOVE this workout. It is challenging, but she tells you modifications that you can do.

I am delighted; this challenges me in a different way (my arms are going to look GREAT by the time I deliver!).  It's not too easy and it's not impossible.  Her instructional style is peaceful.

This was a surprisingly challenging video.  The big plus is that the challenge does not come from using extra resistance equipment, like weights or exercise bands, so as long as you have a yoga mat and towel (I recommend a mat towel!), you're good to go.

The big plusses about this video are that you can just play it and start the exercise.  The angles that the video is shot in are good enough to really show how to do it, and the voice over (which has an option to be turned off!) is concise.  The movements can be challenging at times, and there is a recommendation in the beginning to back off, start/stop as needed - which unfortunately you are not reminded of much later, but must remember.  I was mildly sore after this work-out, which was surprising due to not feeling it was as challenging at the time I was doing it.  The workout is also relaxing and calming in a way that some other pilates fitness workouts are not.

So far, this is probably my favorite prenatal fitness video, and I've tried at least a half-dozen by now.  It's not an everyday video for me, however, due to the challenge, but it's great for once or twice a week.",1310169600,,1213,4.403587443946188

This workout is the complete package - it has a workout that will get your heart rate up and muscles burning, but yet it is very gentle on your body. It also has a nice stretching workout at the end. I highly recommend it.",1307923200,,554,4.285714285714286

3789074,5,B001TC8PNM,"Right now I am 5 months pregnant and I have been using this DVD for about 3 months now and it is my absolute favorite out of all the one's I have. Exercising has always been apart of my life so there's not too many types of exercises I haven't tried and I must say I am impressed. I also have Lizbeth Garcia's 10 minute Solution Prenatal Pilates and let me tell you that Lizbeth Garcia is no match for Suzanne Bowen. You get a fabulous workout that really does leave you feeling longer, leaner, stronger, and energized. Suzanne creates a wonderful pace that's not too jerky and transitions very well. She hits all of the right spots and definitely challenges you WITHOUT FEELING LIKE YOUR HURTING THE BABY. When I want an intense workout, this is the DVD I usually reach for. That is, after I get in a 30 min cardio which I have to incorporate but that's just me. I also have Erin O'Briens Prenatal Fitness Fix which is also a great exercise routine. Not as intense but does give you that extra umph of cardio in addition to the toning that I need and leaves me feeling refreshed. I highly recommend Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout pregnant or not.",1306281600,,1163,4.413953488372093
3789075,5,B001TC8PNM,"I suppose that I shouldn't have been surprised by the ballet forms since so many of the reviews mentioned dancing. I just figured dancing was going to be some type of walking or moving to music as an aerobic exercise. I was pleased to be wrong.

  This work out was not a bunch of walking back and forth pretending you don't look like an idiot. It was more geared towards postures, though she kept your arms or legs moving for most of it to keep your heart rate up.

  I hadn't had a real exercise routine in a while. So the first time I watched the DVD I had to stop after the first section and the next day I was sore. The next time I watched it, I did the second section, followed by the stretching.  It wasn't as hard as I had thought it might be. I'm pleased that now I can do the whole thing in one session, but I do get fairly sweaty in the process, but not real short of breath. (I'm only starting my second trimester)

  All in all I really liked this workout. The instructions were straight forward. You don't need any fancy balls/bands/weights/etc., just you, a space on your floor, and a mat (If you like to use a mat). The best part is that it makes me feel like I am stronger than I thought. I would recommend this product.

UPDATE: Now that I am in my third trimester (only 6 weeks to go) I am having trouble doing the entire DVD at once. I do have to take breaks and alter some of the moves. I find myself doing one section at a time again, but it still feels good to excersize and it still makes me sweat, even doing one section at a time.",1306195200,,1556,4.0688524590163935

The exercises are challenging without being too hard for a growing belly (for reference my favorite video before getting pregnant was Jillian Michaels 30 day Shred which I did 3 times a week).  I have some other prenatal workouts that are just too easy - they feel like a waste of time.  This one feels like you are actually doing something good for your body!  One of the other great things about this video is that it lets you choose to do the entire video or just one segment (Standing, Floor & Relaxation), which is great for when you are short on time or not feeling very motivated :)  Also a plus for me is that it requires no equipment whatsoever.  I live in a small NYC apartment and basically only have room for a yoga mat - and its perfect! The only thing I wish is that the girl in the video was a little further a long in her pregnancy (she looks to be between 5 - 6 months) - it would be encouraging as I get even bigger!",1300320000,3,1020,4.157360406091371

It is challenging enough that it provides a good, total-body workout. And don't be discouraged if you can't complete all of the exercises or repetitions the first time around. Suzanne instructs that you can start and stop as you need.  The next day, I didn't feel sore, but could definitely tell that my muscles had been worked.

3789085,5,B001TC8PNM,"After reading countless reviews, I purchased 3 prenatal exercise videos.  Since I noticed someone else reviewed three videos together, I thought I would do the same so you could compare these as well.

(For what it is worth, I'd consider myself to be in relatively good shape.  I like to do spin classes on the weekend at the gym and will also try to do some shorter workouts during the week.  When I first tried these videos at the end of my first trimester, I considered these to be good easy workouts.  Now that I am in the middle of my pregnancy I am appreciating the videos more since I feel limited as to what I can do.  I still do not feel like I am getting a fantastic workout after these (I prefer gym), but at least I know I am keeping in shape while pregnant.)

Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout - If I were to pick only one of the videos, this is the one I would select.  I really enjoyed the mind/body component of the video while I was able to get nice overall toning through standing, mat and stretching exercises.

Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga by Elena Brower - I thought this was a very nice prenatal yoga video.  The setting of the video is beautiful and I found the poses to have a nice flow.  I liked it much better than anything in the Livingarts series I've tried and would say that it falls just under my favorite Power Yoga video from Rodney Yee.  The poses in here really are not that advanced, but I think they are geared nicely to what we can do as our belly progresses in size.

Complete Pregnancy Fitness with Erin O'Brien - I found this to be the best of the three for an aerobic workout.  I'd say it is primarily a toning video, but also does a good job getting your heart rate up in the process.  ...I think I would enjoy it more if Erin wore a shirt that covered her belly and staged it in a more professional environment than her home ;)",1299024000,8,1890,4.225626740947075
3789086,5,B001TC8PNM,"I really enjoy this workout. It's challenging and the 50 minutes really fly by. It is low impact, but really heats up your body and gives your muscles a deep burn that you can feel the next day. The instructor encourages you to listen to your body and stop and start as needed.

It is also very relaxing; the music and quality of the DVD is nice. I love the relaxation segment at the end. I really felt like I did something good for me and my baby and I use that time to connect with my little one. :-)

The only con about this workout is some of the moves/positions may become very hard during the last trimester. Right now I have a moderate 5 month bump. I guess I'll just have to adjust as I go. Still highly recommended!",1298246400,,724,4.127659574468085

This video is proving to be perfect in getting me back into shape.  I definitely find it challenging, and was sore after the first time I did it, but it's something to work up to.

The video is a workout, for sure, and is probably OK for yoga pros and super fit mommas-to-be, but I'm not sure it's appropriate for a more general audience.  I'm not a beginner to yoga at all, but this video was fast-paced, rough and had my heart rate higher than I'm guessing was completely ""safe"" during my second trimester.  There also aren't a lot of modifications for the different stages of pregnancy and I couldn't even complete half the poses in the ""floor work"" section of the DVD!

All in all, pass up this video for Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga DVD.  This one is far more appropriate for all stages of pregnancy.",1297209600,16,759,4.544117647058823

The movements are easy to follow, but do get your heart rate up. A few minor things: I'm further along than the instructor, and there was a floor stretch or two I had trouble with because my stomach is bigger and I can't cross my leg in front of my body and lean into it, and I had to stop a few times because even though it was leg exercises, my shoulders and wrists were getting sore from holding myself up (after all, I'm currently toting around 17 extra pounds of belly). I would have appreciated just a couple second break between some of the leg series. BUT this is all minor stuff, and obviously, I can just stop for a second if I need to! Overall, the music didn't get on my nerves, which happens frequently with exercise DVDs, and I enjoyed this workout.

3789095,5,B001TC8PNM,"I've always been an avid exerciser, so I've found many pregnancy workout videos way too easy. But I LOVE this one. This workout is challenging for both the upper and lower body (lots of lunges, and some great arm moves) and I love the end stretching section. I don't find it particularly boring or monotonous -- yes, she leads the exercises in a studio with a simple backdrop, but I don't need bells and whistles like scene changes to enjoy a good workout. In fact I quite like the simplicity because I get annoyed easily by super perky and corny instructors.

I also really like this video because all you need is a workout mat -- no balls, weights, etc. This was really useful when I went on a two-week vacation in Italy. I burned the video onto my iPhone and could do it in my hotel room during downtime. So great! I highly, highly recommend this workout for pregnant women who take exercise seriously.",1290902400,,905,4.484848484848484
3789096,5,B001TC8PNM,"This workout was great for staying fit throughout pregnancy.  I had bought a couple of prenatal workout DVDs once I realized getting to the gym after work wasn't going to happen anymore (so tired).  I was pretty active before pregnancy and had danced for years.  I was looking for something that would encourage healthy stretching, kegels, and strength training.  This met all those expectations.

I was a bit overwhelmed the first workout as the instructor goes right into diamond push ups and some great arm workouts, but if you want to sweat (and I do) this is great.  I had tried a dance prenatal workout that was so blah I didn't even glisten.  I know other reviewers complained that the setting and format were cold, but I didn't mind at all and of the options provided, I loved the instrumental only workout which was nice because I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment, and hated having the neighbors know every time I was working out.  (strange but true). Also the flexibility to create your own workout by rearranging and selecting the standing, mat, stretching and relaxation portions was great and motivated me to workout more regularly knowing I didn't have to do the whole tape.

The postnatal workout was nice as well and is essentially just a bunch of crunches and a few kegels.  Postnatal I switched to the p90x abripper DVD by Beach Body (16 minutes at 350 crunches) and have also been doing the Tupler technique to repair some diastasis recti (separation of the abdominal muscles).  The Ab ripper exercises are searchable using any search engine, if you don't want to splurge on the whole p90x set of workout DVDs and Tupler's workout is available for purchase through her website, maternity fitness. This combo seems to be much more effective/aggressive for my liking and at 7 weeks postpartum my tummy is pretty much gone!  I do the abripper every other day, 500 Tupler style crunches everyday and a couple hundred kegels a day for good measure.",1289260800,12,1967,4.752941176470588
3789097,5,B001TC8PNM,"I love this video!  I have always been very active, exercising six times a week.  So I wanted a prenatal video that was challenging.  Even though there is no equipment used, the heart rate really gets going.  Using your bodyweight is a great way to stay fit, especially when pregnancy adds 30+ pounds.  I was very pleased with pace of this video.  It's easy to keep up with the instructor, but it doesn't become monotonous.  I also like the instructor's voice - very low-key and relaxing. It is pre-recorded, so the script remains accurate and in time with the moves.  (No out-of-breath instructor stumbling over her words or making mistakes.)  I haven't done the post-natal section yet, as I am still pregnant.  But I am into my 3rd trimester, and have no trouble keeping up.  The push-ups are the most difficult section, but just enough to really get a sweat going.  She takes breaks between sets.  The stretching section is very thorough and ends perfectly with a lengthy relaxation segment.  I would highly recommend this for someone who wants a challenge during pregnancy.",1286755200,,1077,4.814207650273224
3789098,5,B001TC8PNM,"I describe this to friends as pliometrics, dance, and pilates-esque techniques.  There is a 20 minute standing segment, 20 minute floor workout, and 10 minute stretching.  There's also a postpartum segment that I haven't checked out yet.  Because you can go at your own pace, you can get through the whole thing the first time.  To pace yourself, bend or reach less or more as you get stronger.

Strengths:
- Every motion works three or more parts of the body (such a good use of time - much better than the Summer Saunders workout - I don't use that one at all anymore).
- After 5 days of doing this video, I am noticeably more toned - for example, my tummy is ""sticking out"" less than before (being on my third pregnancy, this is helpful since I stick out more and more quickly each time!).
- Even my friends that aren't pregnant say this is a GREAT workout!  It gets your heart rate up, but not too elevated that you can't talk to friends, which is a good indicator that it's not too high for the baby.
- I also appreciate that there is a version of the video with just music and no instruction, for a more relaxing environment, when you already know how to do all the exercises well.

I am a fairly athletic person who until recently (about 1 month ago) was running and strength training several times a week. I found out that I was pregnant about a month ago and have not been feeling well. I decided to purchase this DVD because I wanted to continue doing some exercises, but was unsure what was ""safe"" for pregnancy. (the woman appears in her 2nd trimester, there are modifications for the 3rd tri). I LOVE this DVD. I like that it has 3 sections, STANDING exercises, FLOOR exercises and a STRETCHING/RELAXATION section. I have been using it after walking 30 minutes on the treadmill and either choosing the floor or standing exercises, which last 20 minutes each.

The standing exercises are mainly forms of lunges and squats and you definitely feel the burn after a few minutes. It appears that if you wanted to also use a band to work the upper body it would be possible. This lasts for about 20 minutes and there was sweating involved.

The floor exercises were more challenging to me (I am weaker in my upper body). There are modified push ups, and planks with lots of ab and arm work. I was definitely feeling the burn and felt sore at the end.

The stretching was effective although it is where my only complaint lies. I wish that each stretch could have lasted a bit longer to really feel the results. But nonetheless, by the end I felt limber and relaxed.

As someone who has tried countless pilates/yoga/walking DVDs, I enjoyed this one very much and look forward to using it often! Bonus: there is also a postnatal workout at the end!",1283731200,3,1674,4.60738255033557

3789104,5,B001TC8PNM,"Before getting pregnant, I was in training, so I was in pretty good shape. My first trimester, I was sick, sick, sick, unable to work out at all, and I lost a lot of muscle tone and strength. I've been trying to think of the big day (delivery!) as something to train for, and I've been really disappointed in the workouts I've had, in terms of readying me for the strength and stamina I'll need to make it through natural childbirth (with a history of 24+ hour labors in my family).

This DVD kicked my pregnant little tush!! I just did the standing workout, and I was soaking with sweat and wiped out! But while I usually end up with a sore back from standing workouts, this one was paced well enough that I was able to remain vigilant (with nice cues from the instructor) about supporting my back with my abs and pelvic tilt.

I watched the mat workout (not feeling quite energetic enough to do it today), and I look forward to doing it soon. Similarly, the stretching for relaxation is going to require some sweating and exertion.

I won't want to do the workouts on this DVD every day. But for those days when I feel ready for a little muscle strengthening and endurance training, this will be awesome!

3789106,5,B001TC8PNM,"I am about 3 months pregnant and I just did this video for the first time yesterday. I loved it! I'm early enough where I'm not showing yet, but still just being pregnant makes doing a ton of reps or adding weight more tiring and this video seemed the perfect balance. The first 20 minutes of standing excercise definitely got my heart rate up, I broke a sweat, and got my muscles burning a bit! The 20 minutes on the mat pushed me even harder and included some great arm and core work. And of course the final 10 minutes of stretching was great. My arms (oh and they get those hard to reach BACKS of the arms), obliques, butt, and thighs are sore today (although its been a while since I've worked my muscles). Before getting pregnant I ran and excercised moderately, mostly running and yoga/pilates. If you're a fitness buff I still think during pregnancy you could find this video a good challenge even without free weights and endless reps, but certainly if you're like me you'll get a lot out of it. As I said I am on the average both in height, weight, and fitness level. The thing I liked best about this video was that the excercises were challenging enough to make me groan at times and break a sweat, but just when I thought I couldn't keep going, she finished the set. For example in one spot she has you do (knee) push ups. This challenged me because I am not very strong in the upper body, but doing 8 of them, then a childs pose stretch, and then 8 more and repeating this 3 times, was very achieveable, yet still a good workout. I would highly recommend this video to all my fellow mommies-to-be. Hopefully I will feel the same way when I have a big belly!",1276732800,6,1671,4.32484076433121
3789107,5,B001TC8PNM,"I totally loved this. Go and get your copy! This gives a good workout, you don't do any jumping moves or anything just real controlled strength and flexibility moves that leave you sweating and wanting more. I'm almost halfway in my pregnancy and this is my favorite workout dvd. Get it girls, you'll love it.",1276473600,3,309,4.636363636363637
3789108,5,B001TC8PNM,"I chose this DVD to use along with a prenatal yoga routine. I have done pilates on and off for a few years and would consider myself at a beg/intermediate level. This DVD is my favorite (compared with Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, and Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms)!

Suzanne Bowen is clear and positive in her instruction, and easy to follow. I have been doing this at least twice a week since my 12th week of pregnancy, and each time I find new ways to challenge myself in her instruction. I feel strong, powerful and energetic after the workouts. Plus, I find that my back pain improves after the workouts. I have noticed increased strength in my arms and legs, and I am feeling very well toned.

I am looking forward to continuing with the Postnatal section of the workout after my delivery. I highly recommend this DVD.",1276041600,,844,4.582781456953643
3789109,4,B001TC8PNM,"This is my third pregnancy and am so tired of boring, slow-moving yoga videos. This moves a a great pace and is really challenging. It feels like I am working all of those tiny muscles you never new you had but really needs (especially when you're pregnant and start stretching out in weird ways).

It's excellent and the break up of workouts into 2 20 minute sessions plus stretching lets me do a partial workout when I don't have time for something longer.

Love it.",1275350400,2,468,4.4941176470588236
3789110,4,B001TC8PNM,"I decided on this dvd based on other reviews. I'm satisfied with it for the most part (can't speak for the post natal portion yet), but there's a few things I wish I would have known.

In the video Suzanne looks like she's in her second trimester, which is right where I'm at as well. However, once I get into my third trimester I'm going to wish she was there too so I could see if some of this stuff is modified for the growing belly. However, Suzanne is really good about mentioning modifications while exercising, so I don't feel that this is going to be a problem.

The video starts off with standing floor work. She manages to get the heart rate going without overdoing things. However, I wish I would have known how much squat work is in this portion of the video, I have bad knees and this part is often painfully shaky for me. Aside from the squat work (which I modify), the standing floor work is a very good workout for the legs and even the arms in some parts. I'm not in very good shape and I'm by far no yoga expert (one class in college), but at the end of this section of the dvd I usually feel sweaty but not exhausted. It's satisfying.

Then the dvd moves into the floor work. This portion isn't as ""get you sweating"" as the standing work, but it definitely keeps the heart rate up and works out the muscles. She starts off with ""vacuum abs,"" or cow something-or-other as I knew it in college, then moves right into push ups, leg lifts, and ab work without resorting to being on the back. If it weren't for the push ups (I've never liked those) then this would be my favorite portion of the video.

The stretching and relaxation portion is actually pretty important, or else you'll be sore and tight the next day. It feels great and by the time I'm finished I feel refreshed, relaxed, and ready to take on the rest of the day. The music is relaxing through the video and Suzanne makes it pretty clear what you're aiming for as far as position and which muscle to work.

Overall I'd say this is worth the money. I don't dread turning it on and I feel wonderful after completing the workout. And my hips don't hurt anymore afterward, that's a big bonus for me!",1271116800,79,2176,4.297560975609756
3789111,5,B001TC8PNM,"I have used this DVD the most (so far) of the prenatal workout DVDs I recently bought. I really enjoy the standing work and stretching, but some of the floor work is a little awkward for me. Overall, it is not challenging but your heart gets going, and the stretching feels fantastic. She is not annoying/seems like a pleasant lady and you can choose music-only, which is nice. I use this DVD even when I don't feel like working out, so that is really good about it, too.",1269820800,,471,4.363636363636363
3789112,5,B001TC8PNM,"I am a 26 yr old gal who only exercised 4-5 times per month pre-pregnancy. I am now 19 weeks and have been doing this video for 3 weeks now and exercising daily (normally alternating this video with the 10 minute solution pregnancy video and the Perfect Pregnancy Workout and the occasional treadmill workout) I cannot say enough about this video!! I absolutely love it. While I am doing the exercises I can feel a really great burn, and the pace is a nice medium pace. I hate slow workout videos. I save this for the days when I have the most energy and want a great workout. I always love the feeling the next morning when my whole body feels tighter and smaller! The video is modern and the music is nice. The exercises flow nicely and I seriously don't get bored. The relaxation part at the end is too long for my taste but by then I am so exhausted I don't care! This is my #1 video and I would recommend it to all fitness types! You might have to start with one of the sections until you are strong enough for both, but it is so worth it!",1269475200,2,1044,4.173267326732673
3789113,5,B001TC8PNM,"I am in my second trimester and have worked out moderately most days though this, my second pregnancy. I have checked out a lot of Prenatal Pilates inspired workouts. This is the only one of two, I can give 5 stars (Jillian Moriarty's Pre/Postnatal yoga & Pilates Workout, being the other). I wish I had found this one sooner. It incorporates the best Pilates has to offer a pregnant woman integrated in to a full workout. I found the workouts good quality, original, simple, safe, healthy, challenging, gentle, effective, sculpting, strengthening, stretching, and flexibility promoting, with a little cardio. What else could you ask for? I suppose a person who is still in their first trimester might think it to easy or simple or to difficult in their third trimester, but I sure wouldn't. I think it is a wonderful DVD to add to your prenatal exercise routine, and if you have no routine, it is a great DVD to start a routine with at any point of your pregnancy.",1268697600,,965,4.682352941176471
3789114,4,B001TC8PNM,"I consider this video very helpful, have good exercises on the cardio section and also on the mat, I think the duration of each section its pretty good considering in a pregnant women. The only thing I'll recommend its get this video on early pregnancy because I got it in my 7th month and my belly don't let me workout very well, besides that the video is excellent.",1268092800,,367,4.411764705882353
3789115,3,B001TC8PNM,"I was looking for a Pilates prenatal workout so this was not it.
This DVD is generally a good workout for a prenatal woman but I have found a Pilates workout for prenatal woman which is better than this workout. I would recommend that a prenatal woman looks for the Pilates workout for prenatal.",1265760000,,295,4.481481481481482
3789116,5,B001TC8PNM,"I love it. I'm only 14 weeks along and this video is kicking my butt! Granted I'm not in the best of shape, but this video is something I can see myself using throughout the entire pregnancy so that I can be the healthiest, most physically fit mother I can be. It is a fast paced video, but all the moves are pretty easy on the joints, even though I have loose, popping joints. Personally I find taking short breaks in between the sections necessary because of the pace. The DVD breaks the workouts into sections for standing (20 minutes), mat work (20 minutes), stretching (10 minutes), and has a bonus 10-minute postnatal ab section. There is also a music only option, for when you get sick of listening to the guide voice after the sixth time.

All in all, great pregnancy fitness option for people who want to get fit, but don't want a video that goes too slow (like most yoga, IMO) or is too physically jarring.",1264032000,3,916,4.420118343195266
3789117,5,B001TC8PNM,This video is excellent.  It's challenging and moves quickly.  I only wish that I would have started it earlier in my pregnancy.,1257897600,2,128,4.7727272727272725
3789118,5,B001TC8PNM,I have been using Teddi Bryant's Hot Mamas Workout every other day and started to get a bit cocky thinking I could easily do the Long and Lean workout without really noticing any burn...Wow...was I wrong!  Long and Lean is a great workout.  You don't need weights...just the weight of your own body.  I got a great burn in my arms and legs during the standing sequence.  The mat sequence requires a lot of laying on your side and works on your balance which is very important during pregnancy.  I have been looking for another challenging prenatal workout and I've found it! Thanks!  I'll be adding this to my regular workout schedule!,1251504000,,635,4.625
3789119,5,B001TC8PNM,"I am 8 weeks into my first pregnancy and was a moderate exerciser before conceiving.  I'm not a fitness buff (in fact, I was in the process of trying to lose a good amount of weight before becoming pregnant) but I am pretty good at being consistent with exercise.  I have always been a fan of The Firm videos because they have kept me fairly toned over the last few years.  After becoming pregnant I decided these workouts were a little too ""bouncy"" in parts to be used for a prenatal workout so I began searching for a true prenatal workout dvd.  I am so glad that I purchased the Long and Lean Prenatal Workout from Suzanne Bowen and Leah Sarago!  It is definitely challenging but you have full freedom to perform the exercises at your own level and pace.  What's great about it is that the movements you are doing are very controlled and somewhat slow, helping you to remain balanced but also helping you to build up your balance ability (which is very important for pregnant women).  You can choose to do the three segments of the workout separately or all together as one workout.  If you are a beginner, just realize that you have the freedom to stop, start and workout at your own pace.  Just challenge yourself to do a little bit more each time and you will definitely see improvement.  I think that any motivated pregnant woman would find this prenatal workout both gratifying and strengthening.",1240185600,55,1404,4.557768924302789

8341029,4,B001TC8PNM,"I wanted to ask this as a question, but the option wasn't available on the product listing, so this is a review/question specific to the copy of this DVD I received.  To start with, I love Suzanne Bowen, and I was excited to try this video.  However, my copy didn't play on my computer.  I could see the main menu but couldn't click on anything or start the exercise segments; it was as if my computer didn't recognize the menu buttons as being clickable.  Another exercise DVD worked fine on the same computer moments later, as have all others I've tried in the past.

Did anyone else have this experience when trying to use this DVD on a computer (not DVD player)?  I'm debating whether or not to replace it since I rely on being able to play exercise videos on a computer.  Four stars because Suzanne Bowen is an excellent instructor and I don't want to mess up the ratings based on a potentially bad copy; then again, this could be an issue with all copies of this DVD.  Sorry that this isn't a proper review, but Amazon doesn't have the question box on this page.",1503619200,,1068,4.385786802030457

8341033,5,B001TC8PNM,"First Trimester life saver! Video is broken into segments that can be played individually or all together for a longer and more challenging workout. Each segment is well designed for those days that you have more or less energy. As a first time mom, who was active and fit prior to pregnancy this has been a highly beneficial transition workout video for pregnancy. I also like that the video was designed with alternative movements for those days when you just cannot seem to keep up.",1488499200,3,485,4.7176470588235295
8341034,3,B001TC8PNM,"I am a yoga instructor working towards certification in prenatal fitness.  I also am currently about 20 weeks pregnant and was looking for some videos to mix up my personal practice.  I was personally disappointed to see so many exercises on all 4's as well as a lot of ab work.  In my personal  training and research, these have been red flagged as unsafe to do later in pregnancy.  Abdominal exercises such as crunches, sit-ups and planks after the first trimester can all contribute to worseing of a condition called diastasis recti.  We will make a long story short and say its common in pregnancy, but certainly not something you purposely would want to exacerbate. There are traverse abdominal exercises that are safer for pregnancy.  All 4's work also creates issues with how pressure is distributed and could later contribute to issues with incontinence.  Women could cause some long term problems by repeating this DVD throughout their entire pregnancy.  I think first trimester it would all be great.  I still gave this 3 stars because I did personally enjoy the relaxation portion and a lot of the exercises are great ones.  If you already own this and are pregnant I would avoid the extended all 4's and ab work after first trimester.  Its really upsetting all the bad information out there for pregnant women and I don't cast judgement really on the creator of this DVD as I don't know how recent the information I share came to be understood and I realize there are different schools of thought on what is or is not recommended in many areas of fitness.  I did a lot of research work in college and I will say finding reliable information on how to best exercise in pregnancy has been a challenge.
