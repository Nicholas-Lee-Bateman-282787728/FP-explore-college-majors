7855850,4,6303935613,"In these ballets, I find it impossible to find fault, however, I am compelled to give this video only 4 stars, only due to the unfortunate translation from stage to television.  Having seen both ballets on stage, there is just no comparison.  Other than this little issue, I have nothing but favorable words.
The excerpts from Jewels are truly a delight to behold, with a great emphasis on the ""Diamonds"" pas de deux with Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins.  Although Farrell mentioned her personal disappointment with the recording, I am glad that her dancing was captured on film.  Watching her gentle interpretation of the piece, it is understandable why Balanchine was so focused upon her.  And Martins is spectacular, too.  ""Emeralds"" is always a delight, and all performers therein are perfectly cast.  The pas de trois with Bonita Borne, Daniel Duell and Heather Watts is wonderful, lilting and joyous.
Stravinsky Violin Concerto sadly suffers greatly from the translation to television - parts of the editing are very choppy, and seem poorly connected.  However, the work of Karen von Aroldingen is magnificent - her quicksilver footwork is perfectly suited to Stravinsky's work.  The ensemble works so beautifully together, as if a single body.
Overall, this video is a must-have for the balletomane, and especially so for the lover of George Balanchine's work.  Despite its little problems, it stands as a wonderful example of the master's best work.",1081123200,8,1459,5.1440677966101696
