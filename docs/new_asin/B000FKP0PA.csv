8124234,3,B000FKP0PA,"Tells the story oveall. The narrator (Mclain) doesn't seem to have an initimate background in wildfire fighting, but he tries to sound this way. The interview with an actual surviving firefighter who was there, is priceless!",1515110400,,224,5.25
8124235,3,B000FKP0PA,"It covered its important subject only marginally, which is what I expected out of a video treatment of a remarkable book.  Some of its animation helped me to clarify details in the book.",1485734400,,186,4.636363636363637
8124236,5,B000FKP0PA,"Excellent! I am a Montanan and lived close to where this fire took place. It is above what is known as the ""Gates of the Mountains"". In the summer there are boat trips up the river. Beautiful. As you progress up the river if you look back it looks like the Gate in the Mountain is closing behind you. If you travel in the Helena Area take the Gates of the Mountains trip. When you get to the camp ground you can stay and have a picnic lunch or just walk around. There arre ""Mann Gulch"" signs you can follow. When you are done you can take the next boat back to where you started. I makes for a beautiful afternoon.",1457481600,,614,4.082644628099174

8124238,5,B000FKP0PA,I use this video as an accompanying piece to the literature when teaching Leadership and Organization Behavior. It provides a good base to help my students understand the importance of ensuring that decisions and instructions are communicated in a way that makes sense based upon 1) the situational context and 2) how individuals process information.,1425513600,3,350,5.381818181818182
8124239,4,B000FKP0PA,Pretty well done but not quite up to the standards of the History Channel. Just didn't resonate well with me since I know lots about that disaster.,1419811200,,147,4.481481481481482
8124240,4,B000FKP0PA,"This video combined with the book The Leadership Moment: Nine true stories of Triumph and Disaster and Their Lessons for us all (Chapter 2) Wagner Dodge retreats in Mann Gulch by Michael Useem is a must for anyone who leads fire teams.

There is no glory in surviving when 13 team members are dead.

Leaders lead by communicating not by being the 'strong silent type' especially when lives depend on them.

8124241,4,B000FKP0PA,"I am a high school teacher and we read Young Men and Fire, by Norman MaClean, earlier this year.  The book is basically about trying to solve how the Mann Gulch fire happened. I showed this video afterwards, and most of the students were engaged by it, especially by the interview of one of the three survivors.  Overall, the video was well-done.",1306454400,6,346,4.564516129032258
