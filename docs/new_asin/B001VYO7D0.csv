Its realism also gives you the feeling that neither the French nor the German soldiers are anything but helpless pawns in the grip of some large and largely malevolent  force of nationalism and anti-humanism.  I would like for there to be a much broader audience for this film, especially among the poor demented Republican party and the brain dead Tea Party.",1421020800,,479,4.759036144578313
8346814,5,B001VYO7D0,"Given that World War One ended in 1918 and this film was made in 1928 is a remarkable by itself. I have studied the World War one era most of my life and no other film ever made, not past nor present better tells the story of the futile battle of Verdun. Forget the stories of glory and courage that have been told by John Wayne. This version of history is probably more accurate than any other. With out words being spoken, (don't forget 1928 was still the silent era of films), this correctly shows the frustration between the troops in the trenches and military leaders behind the lines on both sides of the conflict. This film clearly shows the disconnect between the military generals who live a plush almost royal lifestyle, while giving orders for hundreds of thousands of troops to move forward to a certain death. As the film moves along the mood of the soldiers changes, but not the generals who are all so certain that if the troops just push a little bit harder they can bring victory at Verdun. As the battle rages on you begin to see the new technologies of war being used, such as poisonous gas. As hundreds of thousands die in the muddy, trenches the home front begins to feel the pain as the dead pile up. One of the most moving scenes in the movie was seeing the ghosts of Verdun emerge. Using at that time special effects, the film director was able to show the ghosts rise up and then fade away. A must see movie for anyone who is into the period of World War One.  Using both real film footage from the actual battles and staged ones, this film brings home the impact of the war like no other film.",1289865600,,1619,4.343234323432343
