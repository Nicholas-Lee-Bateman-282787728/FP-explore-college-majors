3685425,5,B001LM64D8,This was a good product to add to the ones I have for use with the children at church.  They liked it.,1369699200,,102,3.6363636363636362
3685426,4,B001LM64D8,"I love this product nicely presented for kids. My kids and I enjoy watching it, over and over this a great satisfaction for the mind",1367452800,,132,4.32
3685427,3,B001LM64D8,I love ordering Bible story videos for my children. This video ended very horribly. The promise child was not the child bore by Haggar the servant; it was the child of Sarah. This video would leave a person who does not know the Bible believing that the child of Haggar was the promise child. I do not like any of the cartoons in this series.,1340582400,6,342,4.276923076923077
8318468,5,B001LM64D8,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75
8318469,1,B001LM64D8,"This ""story"" is totally inaccurate and deceptive.  It includes distorted fiction and does not tell the true account of Abraham's encounters with God and very adventurous life.  Save your time and  money, and prevent confusion.  Even kids need the truth.",1480204800,,253,5.25
8318470,1,B001LM64D8,"The script on these videos definitely does not reflect the Biblical story. There are also several ""Damn You!""s thrown in. I tossed my entire set after watching a few of these to preview them for my class. Don't waste your money on these!",1447200000,2,237,4.534883720930233
8318471,5,B001LM64D8,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588

8318475,1,B001LM64D8,This DVD is horrible it added parts to the story that are NOT in the Bible! Therefore misleading and distorting the word of God!,1400198400,3,128,4.375
8318476,5,B001LM64D8,"The first story i bought from the ""Under Gods Rainbow series was THE PROPHETS. My children (8,6, and 3) loved it. they watched it so much they could even recite every word said. It has helped me teach the children about out faith in a way that i could never have done myself. I even watch it sometimes and it helps me with the specifics of names and places and times in the Bible. its a must have for very home. We all love this DVD and I have currently placed an order for 5more",1387411200,,479,4.052631578947368
8318477,3,B001LM64D8,I just used this DVD with my lesson on the Story of Abraham in our Sunday School class and was a little disappointed in it. It is not the same quality of the ones purchased from Nest and I will try and replace it.,1382918400,4,213,3.8636363636363638
