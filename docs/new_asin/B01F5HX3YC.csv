8760164,5,B01F5HX3YC,"Worth every penny. The review coverage is perfect from start to finish. Since i don't have cable and I normally miss when there are streams of the TT, this is perfect. $20 to have all the races in HD to pause whenever I want? It's perfect. I loved this so much I went and grabbed 2015 too and will continue buying each year as an awesome collection. Would love to be there in person but $20 to feel like I'm there is good with me!",1470873600,3,430,4.070588235294117
