8101650,5,B000CS4600,"This DVD is a dandy, full of great photography of the post-Civil War belle epoch era that Annie Oakley inhabited as America's first female pop-cultural superstar, right on down to perhaps the greatest treasure of all; experimental Edison film clips that give us little fleeting glimpses of the actual Annie in action. Considering what a huge star and personality Annie was, it is amazing how little known and understood she is today, with what little the average American does know about her being complete and total bunk. The fact is, Annie was a fascinating character from a fascinating period of American history, and this film does a highly workmanlike job of telling her story.",1245888000,5,682,4.991228070175438
8101651,5,B000CS4600,This was a good documentary about Annie Oakley that did not appear to be biased by the autobiagrapher's personal opinions.,1223856000,,122,5.15
8101652,5,B000CS4600,"This is a most interesting DVD.  I never really understood who Annie Oakley was or how she became famous, and most especially what she looked like.  This DVD shows you actual photos and tells the real life story of Annie Oakley.  Especially interesting is to learn of her magnificient skills with guns and the fact that she married someone who had similar skills.  It also tells of their tenure with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.  I enjoyed it very much and am glad to have it in my collection of biographies of people from the Old West.",1217462400,5,538,4.505154639175258
8101653,4,B000CS4600,"I found this bio to be inspiring!  Years ago, my husband and I used to take rifles down to the irrigation pond on his grandfather's farm and shoot at tin cans until they sank.  Great fun! I've loved Annie Oakley since I was a child.  This bio reminded me of why. Time to pick up my rifle again and practice target shooting.",1185840000,5,323,4.17741935483871
8101654,5,B000CS4600,"Jeffery and I agree about the gun aspect of the Oakley legend, but that alone should not distort the fact that Annie was a true pioneer for American women, not to mention the fact that this documentary by the Biography Channel is VERY well done.  This piece if Americana is well worth your purchase!",1155081600,3,299,4.537037037037037
