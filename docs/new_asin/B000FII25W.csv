I think it's in bad taste that others have spoiled the ending by mentioning it here in the review, but it still is a MUST see and a MUST own. The story is beautiful, the music is lovely, and yes, the ending may seem sad to some, but I didn't get out of it what others must have. Since the ending has already been mentioned...in the final episode, they make it clear that Fakir will finish the story.. so, what do they end with but Fakir writing by a pond and Duck happily swimming off to the side.. to me, this is an open ending. Who knows what Fakir is writing, Does he now have the power to finish a story that will become real life? Who is to say. I was a bit unhappy with the end and at first when I heard Duck would stay a duck, I felt cheated because I invested so much time and emotion into the characters, but once I saw the final episode myself, I truly feel there is more to the story. I think it's lets the view imagine whatever they want. It's Wonderful! Please add it to your collection!",1194307200,,1050,4.101941747572815

Though the ending to this gorgeous, flawless anime is subject to heated debate, my true and concrete opnion is that the ending was absolutely perfect. If you are looking to buy this series, COMPLETELY IGNORE anything and everything that is being said about how ""the ending ruins the series"". This is an absolute lie. As with most things in Princess Tutu, it's all in how you look at it.

I've said it once, and I'll say it again. Princess Tutu is the most fantastic anime ever, EVER made. The characters are loveable and unique, the storyline is deep, and the ending is just as wonderful in it's own unique way. Princess Tutu is truly an anime for all ages, to be told about through the ages.

It's worth your money, time, and so much more. Princess Tutu is my hero!

From a traditional Fairy Tale love story point of view the ending of ""Tutu"" might surprise the viewer, but I think it is a mistake to categorize ""Tutu"" as a traditional Fairy Tale - it goes beyond. I found the ending of ""Tutu"" both emotionally and intellectually satisfying being mindfull of the story's own premises, for Ducks love is not a possessive kind of love, but rather an altruistic kind, and our heroine succeeds to show, that the power of hope makes it possible to influence ones destiny itself, even when you are not a powerful being ... and that's not an unhappy ending in my book ;-)",1167091200,4,841,4.651006711409396
