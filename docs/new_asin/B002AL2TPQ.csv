3886454,5,B002AL2TPQ,"This series is absolutely hilarious. Donna, Louise, Karen, Carl and fat Tanya-- I love them all. Don't forget to watch Season One.",1378771200,,130,4.954545454545454
3886455,5,B002AL2TPQ,This show is so funny! I love it. I watched both seasons first on Netflix and was happy to find them on DVD when Netflix took them off. and at such a good price. I wish i could find the hour special now.,1364947200,3,203,3.744186046511628
3886456,1,B002AL2TPQ,I received very good service from Amazon as always and I can't blame them for the contents of PULLING as I ordered thinking it might be funny.  I am a British expat but even I didn't think it was one bit funny.,1356220800,,210,4.0
3886457,5,B002AL2TPQ,"This is easily the funniest show I've seen in many years, and brilliantly pulled off by writers and actors. It's got physical comedy, verbal comedy, and situational comedy, all handled with equal aplomb and timing that's a marvel to watch. The skill on display here, from everyone, is all the more impressive for seeming so effortless. It might take you a little time to catch the show's rhythm and sensibility, but once you do, you'll be hooked. I know I am.",1336780800,,459,4.679012345679013
3886458,5,B002AL2TPQ,This program is absolutely hilarious.  If you love intelligent dark British humor this is for you.  It is genius.  Seasons 1 and 2 are both great.  The acting and the writing are consistently excellent.  No wonder they won so many awards in the UK.  This is seriously the best TV show I have seen in years.,1274572800,6,306,4.375
3886459,4,B002AL2TPQ,"Both season one and two are absolutely hilarious. The sad part is that there are only six episodes per season and you are certainly going to be  wishing there were more! The entire cast is great, the story lines are entertaining and you just keep wishing it wouldn't end.",1255478400,5,271,4.530612244897959

3886471,2,B002AL2TPQ,"I watch a lot off bbc and off beat humor, but this show isn't as funny as I hoped it would b. Humor seemed forced and just not funny.",1421625600,,133,3.6206896551724137

3886473,5,B002AL2TPQ,"Haaaaaaaa, these bawdy drunks are THE BEST! What its REALLY like to be to be a single girl in the city. Watching Sex in the City instead of this is like listening to Taylor Swift instead of Etta James. Such as shame it lasted only two seasons. The Brits always get it right.",1419811200,4,274,4.188679245283019

3886477,5,B002AL2TPQ,"Season 2 was just as good as the first, the ONLY knock is I wish it continued and didn't end so quickly. These are some FUNNY Ladies and I miss them a lot!  It's a funnier version of ""Girls"" the HBO show, This show could have stuck around as long as the GREAT Seinfeld Show with all it's craziness!! I promise you'll laugh until you cry, give them a chance you won't be sorry.",1395705600,3,376,4.081081081081081

3886479,4,B002AL2TPQ,Some really good bits though. Well worth a watch. Especially at the bargain (sub $10) price I picked it up for.,1393459200,,111,4.333333333333333
8359745,5,B002AL2TPQ,"One of the funniest shows ever. So glad to see how Sharon Horgan's career has taken off globally with Catastrophe, and if you're a fan of this, give Pulling a try. I discovered the show years ago in college, and love that I can easily stream it on Amazon now.",1515196800,,259,4.2

8359750,5,B002AL2TPQ,"Please see my season one review and then get this one as well... The episode with a frozen desert on a stick ( no spoilers, do not worry ) is worth the price of the whole season alone. I wish they would release the follow up special as well - had difficult time finding it to watch on the web.",1457308800,,293,3.9

8359754,5,B002AL2TPQ,Even funnier than the first season if possible. These people are nuts!,1432080000,,70,4.916666666666667
