8398956,5,B003KVZ2OA,"Karin Fossum's book: Eva's eye is not yet available in English, However, this first Inspector Konrad Sejer story is adapted to great effect in this film!  Norway's Bjorn Sundquist fits Konrad Sejer to a tee!  I still want to read the book!  But at least now I know the story!  GREAT!  Be aware though of the European PAL DVD format.  I was only able to watch it on my PC.  It was worth it though!",1293926400,,396,4.2
