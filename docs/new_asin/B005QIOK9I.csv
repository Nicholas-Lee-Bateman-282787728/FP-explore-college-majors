8483468,3,B005QIOK9I,"This DVD offers rare clips of Gordon MacRae performing other than the musicals most people might remember seeing him in, such as ""Oklahoma!""  As these clips only cover a span of six years, it is startling to see Gordon age rather dramatically as the segments progress.  However, he sings well throughout.  Gordon performs with his wife, Sheila, in the first three clips, and I was surprised, having heard the two sing together for an early radio program,  that Sheila had lost some of her voice quality.  Naturally, Gordon had to back off a lot or drown her out completely.  One of the nicest songs he performs is ""The Sound of Music.""  All in all, this DVD is good but not great, but still an important collector`s item.  For those who have seen Gordon's movies or heard his recorded music, I also recommend The Railroad Hour, a radio show that he hosted from 1948 - 1954.  CDs or MP3 disks of the episodes are available from several internet sites.  Although this is not a visual program, it is Gordon at his BEST, starring in condensed musicals, operettas, and even a few operas, with a variety of top female singers from the music entertainment industry of that era.",1335657600,8,1170,4.635922330097087
8483469,3,B005QIOK9I,"I am a HUGE Gordon fan! I own many of his movies, songs on itunes, I've even read Sheila's autobiography. I really enjoy him as an artist and performer because he is so amazing! With that being said, this DVD does not do him justice. For one thing, both the sound and picture quality is horrible. The picture in particular is grainy and out of focus in some places. The music is not crisp and clear either.  Gordon, of course is adorable, especially in many of his numbers with Sheila, however, there are many songs on here I have never even heard of. It is interesting to note that Gordon's appearance somewhat changes from the early 1960 telecasts to the 1965 telecasts. Seems to have a bit aging in his face probably the effects of smoking and drinking.  If you are looking for rare Gordon MacRae performances, then you will probably enjoy this DVD. This is why I bought it. I am kinda disappointed in the product though. And yes, this DVD is 28 minutes. There is no dialogue. No introduction. No back and forth between characters and performers.  It jumps from song to song.",1323043200,14,1078,4.517948717948718
8483470,5,B005QIOK9I,...how did they compress 5 years of the Bell Telephone Hour into 28 minutes? Is this a misprint or is the movie only 28 minutes?,1320451200,5,128,4.16
