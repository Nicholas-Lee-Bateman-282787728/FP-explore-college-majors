This 1989 Drottningholm Court Theatre 'Flute' has charming period sets and the orchestra plays on period instruments, so the sound is mellow rather than brilliant, especially since conductor, Arnold Ostman chooses leisurely tempi throughout.

The singers are for the most part young and enthusiastic.  I was especially fond of the priests of the Temple of Isis who were dressed as 18th century gentlemen.  The Speaker and Sarastro had basses that were easy on the ear, both in the spoken and sung dialogue.  The only singer who was a bit hard to listen to was Pamina, who waxed shrill on occasion.

As is usual with all of my 'Flutes' produced in Northern Europe, Monostatos was made up in black-face, which totally embarrasses my American sensibilities.  Papageno was one of the most annoying birdcatchers in any of my 'Flutes.'  He was constantly mugging or doing silly stage business that detracted from the other singers.  His panpipes, blown far more frequently than necessary really got on my nerves.  I kept wishing the Queen's attendants had left the damn padlock on his mouth.  The Three Boys (actually women in this production) sang very well but were also allowed to romp all over the stage in the latter part of the opera (especially during the two suicide scenes), once again detracting from the other singers.

I wouldn't recommend this production as your first 'Flute.'  Try Ingmar Bergman's film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Flute/dp/B000AYKS5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Flute</a>"" (1975), even though it is performed in Swedish, or if you love beautiful singing I can enthusiastically recommend the 1983 Bavarian State Opera 'Flute' (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Die-Zauberflte/dp/B000ASAEQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Die Zauberflte</a>) with the most famous of all Taminos, Francisco Araiza and a Sarastro to die for, Kurt Moll.  The ladies ain't bad either.  Edita Gruberova sings the Queen of the Night and Lucia Popp is a charming, sweetly sung Pamina.",1410134400,,2290,5.6982248520710055

Mozart was and still is the most adventurous composer of any generation...his imagination excels and his composition is brilliant...",1368489600,,249,5.944444444444445
8344828,5,B001URA660,"Beside the Mozart's beautiful music, the singers, customs and stetting are excellent. I would recommend this production to all opera's lovers.  I'm glad to have this dvd.",1364860800,,170,5.296296296296297
8344829,5,B001URA660,"Okay, a lot has been said so far about this production, but am I the only one here to notice the absolutely brilliant staging-- and the marvelous portrayal of Papagena? One reviewer pointed out that this Papageno is one of the best they'd ever seen, but the Papagena here more than holds her own opposite him; she matches him ""feather for feather"" (the scene where she is first forcibly restrained from coming out of hiding as Papageno sings of his wish for a sweetheart, then carried off in high mutiny after being briefly revealed to him, is priceless)

And of all versions I have yet seen, this is the one that does the fullest justice, dramatically speaking, to Pamina's beautiful, heartbreaking lament (Ach Ich Fuhl's). Tamino's reactions for the duration of the scene are spot-on; unfortunately, he spoils the effect the moment she leaves by overdoing it- bursting into melodramatic, *audible* sobs.

As far as the play itself goes, I find the treatment of gender and race troubling, but nonetheless find the music and overall story delightful.

This is the first rendition of the Magic Flute I ever saw, and although there are several excellent versions out there, this is still the one I like the best.",1291161600,,1210,4.835748792270532
8344830,5,B001URA660,"Filmed at the Drottningholm Court Theatre in Sweden (the same theatre where Ingmar Bergman set his classic film of ""The Magic Flute"" 14 years earlier), this production of Mozart's last opera is infused with a delicious 18th century feel. Its simple, wing-and-drop sets reflect the Europe of Mozart's own time, as do the costumes, with most of the principle characters in court dress, and Papageno, Papagena and the chorus in peasant garb. Anyone looking for a lavish fairy-tale ""Flute"" will probably be disappointed by this production's intimate simplicity, but personally, I like its quaint, Old World feel. Furthermore, all the characters are portrayed as believable, engaging human beings, not just dime-a-dozen fairy-tale archetypes. The Queen of the Night is a convincingly distraught mother as well as a villainess. Sarastro has his own fears and anger even amidst his wisdom and kindness. The three Boys are an adorably impish trio, not just deus ex machinas. Papageno is a lovably earthy, mischievous presence, not just goofy comic relief. Best of all, Tamino isn't just a bland fairy-tale prince, but a believable boy on the verge of manhood: friendly, passionate and brave yet vulnerable. Meanwhile, the singing is good all around (though the only really outstanding voice belongs to Laszlo Polgar as Sarastro) and Arnold stman does a fine job of conducting Drottningholm's period-instrument orchestra. I recommend this DVD to any Mozart lover.",1246320000,16,1454,5.326086956521739
