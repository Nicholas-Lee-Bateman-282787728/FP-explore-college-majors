When he(she) buys this product it(he,she) was indicating that it(he,she) had subtitles in Spanish and it(he) is not true, is a terrible lie on behalf of the company that sells it, and the box was coming gully.

8160862,1,B000LC3IQU,"The quality of the video is quite good, the chapters described are as they are on the review.  However the description about the language is false.  I'm from Costa Rica and bought this video as a gift to someone whom does not speak or understand english, reason cause look for a spanish version. When I found it I felt so happy and inmediately bought it, unfortunately after open on X-MAS, I received a call stating that was not in spanish, neither subtitles. After check the dvd found myself so dissapointed since it clearly states that the language was both English and Spanish.
I just want to say the description is not correct on the language point of view.  Everything else is as described but if you are looking for this feature, better keep looking.",1230422400,11,756,4.626865671641791
8160863,4,B000LC3IQU,"All of the BONANZA episodes currently in wide circulation are public domain material from the program's first two seasons. This package draws from that same limited pool. As always with ST. CLAIR DVD sets however, it's the added features that make their product unique-- in this case: a gallery, trivia quiz and slideshow.

Celebrities to watch for: TV game show host Bob Barker tries his hand at acting (""Denver McGee""). Ed Wood's favorite monster, Tor Johnson, makes a guest appearance {""San Francisco Holiday""). Also, there's movie bad guy Lee Van Cleef, FAMILY AFFAIR's Sebastian Cabot and Vic Morrow of the COMBAT! TV series.

By the way-- don't expect the familiar BONANZA theme here. That famous song is copyright protected (unlike these 15 programs), thus the opening credits have a so-so tune tacked onto them.

ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, liner notes appear on box's back cover.
