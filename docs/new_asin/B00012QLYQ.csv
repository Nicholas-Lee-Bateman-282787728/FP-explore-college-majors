""The General"" - Buster Keaton portrays a loyal Southerner during the Civil War who is also engineer of The General. When some Union soldiers make off with his beloved engine, Keaton pursues them in a second train and eventually manages to steal The General back. The plot is a set-up for two superb train chase sequences that climax with one's plunge into a river after a wooden bridge the train is crossing collapses. Recreation of Civil War uniforms and equipage is remarkably accurate, the Tennessee and Georgia scenery perfect. Keaton's effortless and amazing stunt abilities alone make this a most unforgettable film-- a classic in every sense of the word and a must-see!

""The Lost World"" - Scripted by the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who also appears in the film. Stop-action photography and double-exposure trickery bring to life a jungle filled with terrifying prehistoric monsters. It took three years to complete The Lost World, and its February, 1925 premiere was a sensation. Photographic techniques perfected here would be used for many decades to come. As with all such films, the human story is secondary to the on-screen creatures (in this case, various dinosaurs).

""Shadows"" - An early study of racism. Lon Chaney plays a crippled Chinese laundryman in a Christian town that at first shows him no Christian kindness.

""The Shock"" - A physically deformed criminal escapes from Chinatown's female crime boss and tries to make a new life for himself elsewhere. His past eventually catches up with him, which leads to a final violent confrontation.

one is buster keaton's 'the general,' which is simply one of the best films ever made. watch that and 'the great dictator' and you've seen two commentaries upon war and war-culture that stack up to any made since (also, about half the jokes in the austin powers movies).

the second is 'the lost world.' well, the effects are, well they're 1925 effects. but this is basically the launching pad for all monster films since.

the others i'm not too familiar with. lon chaney stars in 'shadows,' which from the cover looks like one of the blatantly racist asian-exploitation films. and the fourth also stars lon chaney in 'the shock.' mad scientist burns down the city, causes earthquakes? i don't know, i'm just guessing from the cover.

i haven't looked at the editions, so i can't comment on the quality, etc., but the keaton is something everyone should see, and the dinosaurs are hokey enough to watch even if you're looking for unintended comic value and not interested in its place in film history. i paid 20 bucks for it as a gift for my father, and i don't feel ripped off, so there it is.....",1102636800,5,1197,4.553488372093023
