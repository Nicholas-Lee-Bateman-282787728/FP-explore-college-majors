What immediately impressed me before I even started the DVD was the inside cover that includes a Teaching Guide. It includes supplemental activities to do with your children while watching the videos. I love this idea! The videos are already geared towards education and this just gives you additional ways to make the lesson really stick.

We all enjoyed Meredith's voice that is perfect for an audience of children. The videos are so engaging and colorful and really held the attention of my three and five year olds. They both started dancing and couldn't take their eyes off the screen.

I always find that videos that include both cartoon images and real people seem to captivate them for some reason. It's like their own magical world to get lost in for a while! They both said their favorite video was ""Bubbles."" I'm guessing that's because I let them blow their own bubbles while they watched it and this really brought it to life for them.

I loved the educational value of Let's All Make a Circle and that it truly is designed to engage children and teach them while being entertained.",1374537600,,1285,4.672566371681416
5669773,5,B00BRWX66U,"Two years ago, when my daughter was an infant, NJTV (my local PBS station) began airing clips of Monkey Monkey Music videos. No matter how intensely my newborn cried and fussed, she became calm, content, and fully focused on Meredith when those clips came on. It was like magic..she was mesmerized!! I spent almost an entire year trying to figure out who this person was since NJTV never mentioned her name! I'm so glad I never gave up..I eventually figured it out, and rushed to purchase Meredith's first video DVD ""Monkey Monkey Music: The Videos with Meredith LeVande"" immediately. We've had that DVD over a year and STILL watch it very very very regularly (almost daily)!

My kids loved seeing the new video clips on NJTV, and BEGGED me to get them the new ""Miss Meredith"" stuff. We were sooo blessed to get our hands on her highly anticipated second DVD, ""Monkey Monkey Music: Let's All Make a Circle"" a little early. I popped it in the DVD player as soon as I got it, and my daughter, who was almost 2 at the time, was in total disbelief that it was *our* DVD and not just a clip on PBS! Needless to say, the were very excited for more Monkey Monkey Music, and this is an outstanding follow-up to the first!! This DVD is SO MUCH FUN, and it has the perfect mixture of things to keep the kiddos fully entertained while they sing, dance, and (shhhh!) learn.

Meredith is a rockstar! She really knows how to create music and video that your kids will become addicted to, and that's okay, because she'll have them singing, dancing, learning, and having a blast doing it!!...Not to mention, moms (and maybe even dads) will be singing and dancing along with them! I really can't say enough good things about Meredith LeVande...She's just so genuine and it touches everything that she does. I respect, and appreciate that tremendously.

If you have young children, Monkey Monkey Music is a necessity!",1371686400,,1899,4.629080118694362
5669774,5,B00BRWX66U,"We were introduced to Meredith and Monkey Monkey Music at a birthday party and have been self-proclaimed groupies ever since. The DVD is engaging, education and makes you want to get up and dance! My girls (1&3) love to dance around and ""shake it loud""--at least 3 times a day! I have even caught my daughter (and myself) singing the songs around the house. I highly recommend Monkey Monkey Music and you will not be disappointed. I have given the DVD to a friend who has 4 children (2,5,9 and 10) and it is the only thing that engages all of them at the same time. Meredith is a mastermind and you can see how hard she works to create an educational, engaging, get-up-and-dance program for children. We cannot wait until the next DVD comes out and will be first in line!",1371513600,2,771,4.436619718309859
5669775,5,B00BRWX66U,"I had the pleasure of attending a party where Meredith was performing.  My daughters both age 2 and 4 had a great time listening and dancing to her music.  Since then I now own this dvd and I can honestly say in the matter of 1 month my kids must have watched it over 100 times.  It is the only dvd that engages them and also provides them with non stop movement because they dance throughout the entire video.  In addition to a mom, I am also a Kindergarten teacher and teach Kindergarten in a primarily esl school district.  This video is my go to video during center time because my students LOVE IT!!  The songs are educational and are aligned to the New York City elementary school standards.  There are numbers, shapes, directions, animals, trees and fruits and vegetables.  My students are learning songs and curriculum but they are having fun doing it.  They sing along to the video which has improved their oral language and now even know how to count by odd numbers. I can't express enough HOW wonderful this video is and how much my students and kids love it.  We will continue to watch this video because it is one video I actually enjoy watching with them.  I recommend this video to everyone I know because I know they won't be disappointed.",1371427200,2,1255,4.484581497797357
8573159,5,B00BRWX66U,Our daughter loves this! She gets up and joins in when it is on. Great quality and it has a nice arc...starts out moderate pace then amps up toward the middle then brings it back down to a slow calm pace by the end.,1518998400,,215,3.909090909090909

I will forever be Monkey Monkey Music supporter and fan.",1445731200,,261,5.119047619047619
8573163,5,B00BRWX66U,"My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves Monkey Monkey Music with Meredith LeVande! I would highly recommend ""Let's All Make a Circle"". My daughter loves to sing and dance to the videos. They are such good quality and better than most other kids-type music videos out there.",1426118400,,273,4.829787234042553
8573164,5,B00BRWX66U,I have a child with special needs who is non verbal. He has loved music since birth and we are always ready to try something new. I came across this video just by scrolling through children's music/videos and decided to give it a try. Instant hit with my little boy! He wants to watch it every night! The songs are catchy and fun for adults too. Not like some music that you cringe when your child wants it repeated 750 times in a day! I hope she will continue to entertain our kiddos for a long time!!!!,1425427200,,504,4.206185567010309
