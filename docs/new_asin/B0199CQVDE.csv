I enjoyed the fresh approach of the story and the lessons because they are real life lessons that we may have experienced or  known others that have.

7565648,5,B0199CQVDE,"When we are faced with extremely difficult news, like a terminal illness, we are terrified beyond words. We have so many questions regarding the next steps and the future. The whys, whens and hows take over our mind. Our life flashes before us and the fear is overwhelming. At that point, we need medical, spiritual, emotional and divine guidance.

Elizabeth is taken on an unbelievable journey after receiving the news of a serious health scare. Her Spirit guides help her to view her fears and sadness differently by introducing Elizabeth to masters of thought, soul, mind, body and spirit. She was inspired and comforted while shifting her thought process to that of possibilities, options, empathy, forgiveness and the ultimate ""key"" holder.
