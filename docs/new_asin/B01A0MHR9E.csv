to stream for free. At this time it is not available to stream on Amazon.

7587946,5,B01A0MHR9E,"""Truman"" (2015 release from Spain; 109 min.) brings the story of Tomas and Julian. As the movie opens, we see Tomas, a Spanish emigrant now in Canada, flying over to Madrid. He is there for an unannounced visit to his life-long friend Julian, an Argentinean theater actor living in Spain. It's not long before we learn that Julian has lung cancer and is refusing any further chemo treatment. Is Tomas there to try and change Julian's mind? And what becomes of Truman, Julian's old dog who has seen better days as well? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Spanish writer-director Cesc Gay. Here he brings an intense and emotional (but never sentimental) look at what a man does with his day-to-day life when his remaining time is limited, and how it affects his relationship with a guy who once was (still is?) his best friend but now lives in faraway Canada. It is important to emphasize that this easily could've been an emotional exploitation movie, yet Cesc Gay manages to infuse the perfect dose of reality. Check out the scene where Julian, accompanied by Tomas, goes to the funeral home to make funeral arrangements. ""And who is the deceased?, asks the funeral director. ""Me"", Julian wryly responds. ""Oh..."" Just because the movie purposefully shies away from obvious emotional exploitation, we find ourselves sucked in even deeper. I was simply blown away by it all. Cesc Gay movie regulars Ricardo Darin (as Julian) and Javier Camara (as Tomas) each provide towering acting performances. But ultimately I feel that the credit must go primarily to Cesc Gay for this wonderful movie, easily one of the best I have seen in a long time (and that's saying something as I see a LOT of movies).

""Truman"" opened to immediate acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival 2 years ago, and went on to garner multiple awards. Imagine my surprise when the movie opened without any pre-release advertising or fanfare at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, I went to see it right away. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, not surprising to me (given the lack of any marketing for this film). Regardless, if you are interested in a slice of life that will resonate closer to you that you may think, or simply want to enjoy a top-notch foreign indie movie the likes of which are all too rare, you don't want to miss this. ""Truman"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1494028800,2,2575,4.745535714285714
7587947,5,B01A0MHR9E,"The movie is excellent!, distinct all movies about love. The storie is bassed on the friends. Intensa, real, me encanto!",1484352000,,120,5.05
7587948,4,B01A0MHR9E,"Ricardo Darin plays Julian an Argentinean &eacute;migr&eacute; who now lives in Madrid and is something of a has been actor. He is divorced and his kids are all grown up and forging their own paths in life. But he has a dog  Truman whom he dotes on. Then one day his old best friend turns up. This is Javier Camera playing Tomas. He has come over from his new life in Canada to see his old friend, for possibly,  one last time.

The story shows how despite a gap of many years they are able to pick up from where they left off and can be as honest with each other as only true friends can be. The dog though is central to everything. They also catch up on past lives that had lain half remembered until now.

Now as a comedy this sort of fails as the humour is more incidental rather than up front. Where it does score is on the relationship side and a very gentle unfolding drama where we sort of know the ending from nigh on the beginning. That said there is enough here to give the plot a degree of vibrancy that engages the viewer. In Spanish with good sub titles this is a reflective film that is designed to be such and will reward those looking for a film with both feet planted in realism.",1482537600,2,1197,4.146551724137931
7587949,5,B01A0MHR9E,"The 2016 Seattle International Film Festival welcomed this wonderful film from Spain and Argentina; it features one of my favorite Argentinian actors plus a doleful Mastiff named ""Truman.""

This third film presented for our press screenings was a huge hit. It has comedy, pathos, lovely scenery and is a sort of ""road"" movie. There is a huge issue at the center of this plot and I can't tell you what it is or it would be a spoiler.

We joined:
  * Javier Camra (""Talk to Her"") Our hero Toms has heard some important news and leaves his wife and family in Canada to visit his long-time friend in Spain. They had been chums in their youth
  * Ricardo Darin (""Wild Tales"") Julian is the friend whom our hero goes to visit. He has confronted a life-changing issue and made up his mind.
  * Dolores Fonzi (""The Film Critic"") Paula is smack dab in the middle of the issue. She doesn't agree with Julian but his decision is set and she can't get him to budge.
  * Alex Brendemhl (""Twice Upon a Time in the West"") is the veterinario. His wonderful face registers all of the reactions we in the audience feel.
  * Javier Gutirrez (""The Olive Tree"") Asesor funeraria has to find out if Julian prefers burial or a cremation. See, I can't tell you any more....
  * Oriol Pla (""All the Ways of God"") Julian's son Nico will have his birthday in a day or so. His father shouldn't overlook it.
  * Troilo (In his first starring role) Truman, our eponymous mastiff, is a beloved pet. His human Julian cherishes him and wants to make sure his life goes on as smoothly as possible.

There are so many surprises I hesitate to tell you very much for fear that I'll do spoilers without meaning to. Just see this one, okay? Right now it's not available in Region 1 format, but I have an All-Region player...Yippee! Oops. I just discovered that this one doesn't contain English captions. I'll have to wait...",1463616000,2,1885,4.480938416422287

8746355,4,B01A0MHR9E,"I'll admit it. I'm one of those filmgoers who usually bypasses a movie if it involves a character with cancer. Why? Because it's too real, too heavy, and too depressing to be enjoyed as entertainment. Fortunately, in Truman, the cancer element never weighs the film down. The filmmaker handles it realistically with caution, light humor, and cynicism. His characters are well-written, relatable, and believable to the point where even his cancer-afflicted character manages to elude viewer sentimentality and/or pity. Instead, viewers are more likely to identify with him or try to understand his thoughts and perspective. The film is named after the lead character's pet and companion, a lunky bullmastiff with an incredibly expressive face and placid temperament. Ironic as it sounds, yet something all too familiar, Truman's owner happens to be more preoccupied with his dog's future mental state and owner-to-be than he is about his own deteriorating condition. Truman doesn't contain much action, or even much drama, but it's the clever dialogue, capable acting, and nature of the relationships that make this film interesting, if not a compelling watch.",1518480000,,1159,5.4088397790055245

8746360,1,B01A0MHR9E,"The problem with this movie is that ALL of the characters are jerks. Except Truman, I guess, but his part is so small and inconsequential that it's absurd to name the movie for him.

The guy who's dying lies all the time for no good reason, he spends his friend's money like a spoiled, manic child (he's an ""Artist"" -- an underemployed has-been stage actor -- so he can't be EXPECTED to have anything of his own but mountains of debts), and he's totally -- TOTALLY -- self-absorbed. Nobody matters but poor Julian, or whatever his name is (Who cares what his name is? Not me).

Oh, but he's dying! Boo-hoo. Everybody dies. It's no big deal, and it is NO excuse for acting like a selfish jerk and abusing the few people who care about him for reasons I CANNOT understand. I wouldn't spend four minutes with him, much less four days.

His childhood friend Tomas, who drops everything at home in Canada to jet back to Madrid for four days because Julian ""needs"" him, seems to be an okay guy until he sleeps with Julian's cousin Paula -- in the most gratuitous, unnecessary, shoehorned-in sex scene I have EVER seen in a movie -- evidently as a means of ""coping"" with their shared grief over the jerk's impending death, totally oblivious to the beloved and loving wife and two kids Tomas parted from with great affection just two days earlier. What kind of jerk does that?

Paula is no better. She frets and interrogates and pouts and sulks and cries because Julian is making his own decisions about dying instead of doing it HER way, whatever that way may be. And she sleeps with Tomas, knowing all about his family back in Canada -- but who cares about THEM? Nobody in this stupid, irritating, obnoxious movie.",1509926400,,1708,4.535714285714286
