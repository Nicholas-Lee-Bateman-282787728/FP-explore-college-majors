8483707,5,B005QROH8I,Great film with Tomas Milian. Directed by the late Lucio Fulci.,1519171200,,63,4.818181818181818
8483708,5,B005QROH8I,Different kind of Fulci film but just as good. It's a historical period piece and it's done very well as only the Master can.,1505174400,,125,4.25
8483709,3,B005QROH8I,"This is actually a thoughtful and well-made bit of historical horror, or if you like, horrifying history.  The director is an anomaly among film makers of this genre: an artist.  He focuses on character consistency and believable psychology.  His use of film technique is never less than inventive and compelling. In addition, the production values here are surprisingly good; the period locations and costumes convincing.  The violence and torture depicted well, shocking, detailed, appropriately upsetting.  A famous true story from 16th century Italy told honestly and boldly by a talented 1960s Italian director.  (It is also unusually well-dubbed in English!)",1456790400,,664,5.59
8483710,4,B005QROH8I,Liked the book,1424390400,,14,4.0
8483711,4,B005QROH8I,"This thing has to have been remastered because the colors are just gorgeous. Not washed out like a lot of 60s movies, yet not overdone, either. The story is okay and you can read the synopsis elsewhere, but I found the cinematography captivating.",1421280000,,246,4.744186046511628
8483712,3,B005QROH8I,"In attempting to tell the story of Beatrice Cenci, this flick jumps from the end - her execution - to how and why she did it, but there are so many tangles (love with a servant, attacking the Roman church at the time, the sinister corruption of the wealthy barons) it has gaping holes of logic and a disregard for actual history. The acting is routine, the re-creation of the routines of the period pretty good - including a view of the Castle Sant'Angelo when it was part fortress, part prison. It has some merit.",1392681600,,514,4.421052631578948
8483713,5,B005QROH8I,This movie is more of a religious film and how the families lived in that era. It is a foreign film so the theme is not as cut and dry to say the father abused the daughter. This guy abused everybody. A.nd then since he was the land owner he got the church on his side. Wow. check it out.,1369958400,2,288,3.816666666666667
8483714,1,B005QROH8I,its a movie that i wasn't excepting when i rented it. it had a slow plot to the movie. i didn't like it,1358553600,,103,3.5217391304347827
8483715,3,B005QROH8I,"The story line was ok.  I felt sorry for Beatrice but she did go a little too far.  Typical Italian tragedy, but almost as if Shakespere had some influence in the forming of the characters and the ensuing drama.  I wouldn't watch it a second time.",1352851200,4,247,4.326086956521739
8483716,2,B005QROH8I,"This is not a bad movie, yet is a quite dull movie. Beatrice Cenci conspires with familiar relatives to get rid of her mentally twisted nobleman father. As a consequence, several of these people get tortured and killed by some team of inquisitors. The movie some scenes of torture that are well achieved as you might have expected for a Lucio Fulci, very little nudity, not a good pace of action, and a dull story. So, I honestly cannot recommend much here, except may be for those who seek to watch a no terror and not very gory Lucio Fulci film.

Technically, a good, region free, DVD widescreen image transfer by Sinister Cinema. The feature runs for about 90 minutes. The  film comes with English audio (dubbed) no subtitles.",1337904000,12,729,4.6434108527131785
