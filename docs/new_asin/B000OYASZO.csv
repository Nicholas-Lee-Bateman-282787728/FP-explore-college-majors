Frankie Laine's prime years were before my time.  And I liked his cowboy songs better then his pop or jazz tunes.  This is a concert dvd with songs like That Lucky Old Sun, Jealousy  and of course Rawhide.  He was getting on up there in years when this was done but he still put on a very energetic show.  This is a good dvd.",1502668800,,456,4.113636363636363
8187225,5,B000OYASZO,"Enjoyed watching this concert, only wished it was longer and contained more of his hits. I did not know that Marty Robbins wrote ""This Time Lord You Gave Me A Mountain"" for him until watching this show.",1396742400,,202,4.486486486486487
8187226,4,B000OYASZO,"This 50 minute concert was recorded by Laine in 1976 in Sheffield England. He was still in great voice (and great ego as well) more than 20 years after his prime ""hit years"". Among the dozen songs he sings with a moderately large band are his mega hits ""Jezabel"", ""Your Cheatin' Heart"", ""that Lucky Old Sun"" and everyone's favorite ""rawhide!"" (Move 'em in, Git 'em out!). The concerts hits a few low points when he resorts to singing sacherine numbers like ""The Theme From 'Love Story'"", and - are you ready? - ""Feelings""! You can tell that the audience prefers the hits by the applause. The camera work is great and there's very little avaible video of Laine in performance. If you are a Laine fan, you'll love this. Just keep your finger on the ""skip"" button as he finishes ""Lucky Old Sun"" or you will be subjected to ""Feelings"".
