3681650,3,B001L67A1E,"It's a ok movie with some technical flaws.. the lighting needed some work, as well as the sound.. live locations had some difficult background noise which needed filtering out. The storyline was fine, the two main charaters could have used a few more acting lessons for sure, though the ""straight"" couple need far more!!!!",1355356800,,322,4.981481481481482
3681651,5,B001L67A1E,"Another fresh flick from Jorge Ameer.  This time its a crime drama interwoven with a mix of romance, supernatural and paranormal activity with a thriller as a backdrop.  Very effective with good production values.  Actors were easy on the eyes and good story.",1292803200,,259,4.976744186046512
3681652,1,B001L67A1E,"i have bought 3 copies of the film, none of which have i been able to play on my dvd or computer.  i have never had this problem with any other movie.  i do not hold the sellers of these 3 films responsible, i believe there is some inherent problem in the manufacture of the dvd.  has anybody else had this problem?",1290124800,,315,4.048387096774194
3681653,1,B001L67A1E,"This is one of those movies that makes one think that one could easily make a decent living churning out god-awful movies for the Here network.  After all, you'd be hard-pressed to come up with something with a plot as ridiculous as this one.  Of course the fact that it's acted with a cast with less acting chops than the GEICO ghecko and directed with the finesse of Ed Wood, Jr. doesn't help.

Movies like this make me want to file a class-action discrimination suit.  Surely we don't have to put up with movies this bad just because we're gay...",1240617600,13,549,4.46
3681654,2,B001L67A1E,"I like watching independent films -- especially those made on a budget because it's a real test of the people involved and whether or not they have the ability to produce excellence above what they have been dealt. It's certainly possible, ""Fat Girls"" comes to mind. This movie I really wanted to like -- the two leads are especially handsome, if a little wooden in their deliver. at least they had some chemistry and you like watching them when they're onscreen. The father figure was pretty bad -- his line delivery was completely unrealistic and embarrassing. Same way with most of the other cast. The dialogue was unrealistic and inane. I think the director has some good ideas -- he just needs to fully develop them before placing them on celluloid (or a hard drive).",1237507200,3,772,4.725925925925926

3681656,1,B001L67A1E,"The title is French for ""What can I say?""  It's a rhetorical question, especially in the case of this ""movie,"" because it left me at a loss of words.  And not in a positive way.  Because I believe that some good could be found in all things, I'll try as I might to highlight the good before I give the onslaught of the bad.

THE GOOD

Well, most of the actors were good-looking.  And let's see.  Oh!  The scenery was beautiful even though I never could figure out where the setting of the movie ever was.  Let me think some more.  No, that's pretty much sums it up.

THE BAD

Where does one start?  Well, the most obvious is the abomination that they called acting.  I have never been to a day of acting classes and acted in a total of two plays in elementary school, both of which I was an extra in.  I am confident that I can act circles around everyone in this movie--combined.  I have never such unimaginable, unoriginal, inauthentic, bland actors in my entire life.  The director knew this, which is likely why he hired good-looking people to play the roles.  Maybe if we focus on guys in tight pants, we won't notice that we're being experimented on by actors who finished their orientation day of acting school.  Their pants would have to be so tight that they're cutting off circulation and at risk of causing asphyxiation for us to forget about the risible acting.

The props and digs throughout seem like they were rented--not bought--from the dollar store.  Everything was as bland as the acting, nothing compelling to keep a person glued to the television.  I don't know how old this movie is, but based on props alone, it looked like it could have been from the early 90s.

SUMMARY

If you can't find anything else to watch in Prime, I would still suggest skipping this film and, perhaps, picking up a book on how to dry nails after you have been to a  manicurist.  Anything will be better than this train wreck.",1431302400,,1925,4.444126074498567
3681657,1,B001L67A1E,"Sometimes I think I watch these things just to punish myself for having watched much better movies with gay themes. Actors who cant act, lighting design that doesnt light properly, and a screenplay that amounts to nothing. Most annoying aspect, aside from all the rest, is how actors pause before delivering or responding to a line, as if they hadnt memorized their lines or were checking cue cards.",1425168000,,399,4.882352941176471
3681658,1,B001L67A1E,"Starts out bad (acting, writing) and just gets worse. Skip the 'haunted' aspect... the base story is totally unbelievable. Three rednecks in wife beaters that sit outside all the time drinking beer and reading the bible? Sure, that's happens. Relationships are all unrealistic and the few women in the movie are made to look really stupid. I realize this is low budget but this is really bad.",1424304000,3,392,4.865671641791045
3681659,1,B001L67A1E,Didn't even watch the film but the titles tells me it's crap. LOL.,1422230400,,66,4.153846153846154
3681660,1,B001L67A1E,"So is the bad acting on purpose? Is it the script? Or both? I don't understand what's going on (except the old man died). Should be a lesson, just because son in the story is hot, doesn't mean the actor can act. Bottom line, the actors and  the script writer need to take more classes.",1418601600,,285,4.181818181818182
3681661,3,B001L67A1E,"Story is decent and scenery is nice, but it moved along too slow. I watched to the end as I found the story itself interesting, but had to work at staying up to the very end.",1417392000,,174,3.861111111111111
3681662,1,B001L67A1E,Worse than horrible.,1415836800,,20,6.0
3681663,1,B001L67A1E,"Simply terrible. Terrible script, acting and premise. If the budget was over ten grand for the entire movie, I'd be shocked. The only bright spot in the entire movie was the naked butt of the lead actor, and that's sad when a movie is boiled down to a body part.",1408838400,,262,4.26
3681664,3,B001L67A1E,"This film has a surprising level of appeal, despite obvious weaknesses of plotting and focus.  The two main characters are both very appealing and attractive (""John"" is a near look-alike of Colin Farrell), though the chemistry between them is somewhat lacking.  The setting is quite beautiful, as is the title house.  But the film can't decide who it is about.  It begins as Adam's story, morphs into John's, and then becomes a young married couple's after they move into the house.  The ghostly aspect is introduced only in the last 30 minutes and doesn't fit well with the more interesting earlier story line.  In other words, there's a lot to criticize here, but still it kept my interest and attention.",1405728000,,706,4.841666666666667
3681665,4,B001L67A1E,"I saw the short film version of this from another source, leaving many unanswered questions and was intrigued enough to take the chance...and wasn't disappointed. The gay bashing, both verbal and physical I'll probably never get used to, and shouldn't have to. Homophobia has been a thorn in my side for years now, even though it hasn't happened to me yet, and I'm disgusted that the epidemic had to go so far before anyone felt enough is enough, R.I.P. Matthew Shepard, I don't care what that new book says, you'll always have my love and respect.) The people who continue to base their prejudice on this from the Bible, two words: historical context. As for so-called righteous judgment, no such thing! Most holy rollers have no tact, let alone respect, so that argument won't work on me. Would I watch other movies by this director, most likely, but being lgbt friendly won't hurt.",1402272000,,884,4.784313725490196
3681666,2,B001L67A1E,"The premise is good, however, the acting totally sinks it!  I can understand the low budget, but I can't understand the bad acting!",1401753600,,131,4.695652173913044
3681667,2,B001L67A1E,"Not a typical Ariztical production.  Most I have are either good or terrible.  This one is in the middle.  A sweet story with lots of potential.  The editor and director did a pretty poor job of keeping the movie consistent.  Much talk is given about how isolated the cabin is in the movie then in one scene the front door is left open and in front of the place is a paved street with traffic.  Again, so isolated and three hoodlums end up there on a regular basis for lunch and scripture study.  Those inconsistencies could have easily been caught.  The speaking in the movies is often slightly halting, not natural flow of speaking.  Still Adam and Anthony are cute guys and the movie is fun watching their budding relationship despite the eventual tragedies.  Overall, the low end of a mediocre movie.  Would I have bought the movie knowing it's quality?  Probably not, however, I have  the movie and the dvd will stay part of my collection.",1397952000,,944,4.580838323353293
3681668,5,B001L67A1E,John Shaw is just perfect for this movie.  Hope he will continue in the years to come and become even greater than he was in this performance.,1383264000,,142,4.2592592592592595
3681669,1,B001L67A1E,"The acting is stilted, not necessarily the fault of the actors. The script is horrible and filled with characters who are absolutely stupid. Painful to watch. The story line had some potential but failed completely. I do not recommend this film.",1382227200,2,245,5.0
3681670,3,B001L67A1E,"It needed a script doctor, a more believable lead, and some less wooden acting. If you can ignore those things you may enjoy it.",1373760000,,128,4.375
3681671,2,B001L67A1E,Acting needs help and the story line is not well written should have had more of a strong love story,1366761600,,100,4.05
3681672,3,B001L67A1E,"Despite the negative reviews here, there are many elements that work well in this film. The storyline is fairly engaging, though not always believable. The soundtrack is versatile and appealing. The way that the opening credits were presented quickly pulled me in to watch, something that many film-makers on low budget films seem to neglect. Plus, there's some beautiful cinematography, the sets look really nice and the cast are all visually appealing. However, as (visually)appealing as the cast may be, most of them simply could not act. The actor who played Adam was probably the most believable character. For the most part though, I felt like I was watching actors in a high school play. Perhaps the worst actors were the married couple that (unfortunately) occupied about the last one-third of the film. For me, that's when the film really fell apart. Not only did the storyline veer off into left field, but the acting quality really plummeted, once the script relied on their acting ability to keep the story moving along. To complicate matters, the male lead playing the detective was not a strong actor either and he was prominently featured in that last segment as well. It simply didn't work. That's a shame, because this movie had some interesting elements to it, but it was simply doomed by the casting choices that were made. Score: 2.5 stars",1365292800,3,1359,4.93886462882096
3681673,1,B001L67A1E,Please do not waste your time with this. How did this movie get funded? Very wooden acting and poor sound effects. Movies are suppose to entertain.,1364601600,,147,4.6923076923076925
3681674,1,B001L67A1E,Jorge Ameer is a terrible director and this film was just another piece of evidence.  His characters are one dimensional and the plot was beyond ridiculous,1363824000,,155,4.961538461538462
8317448,3,B001L67A1E,This is a very good story and you can tell it is low budget so pretty rough around the edges but the acting is good and some of the scenery is lovely.  It really could have been a 5 star movie if it had the budget for additional cameras and more film fro cutting edge but all in all a very good effort.,1518307200,,302,3.7936507936507935
8317449,5,B001L67A1E,"Rough edges, good movie, the hyper critical biatches in the reviews below need to watch it again, the movie has a clear and concise story line, yes it could have been polished a bit more, all movies cant be Titanic. I will purchase this for my collection.",1517356800,,255,4.446808510638298
8317450,2,B001L67A1E,Just OMG! This movie had the potential to be a good movie had the director writer and producer never touched it. The story line is very choppy and neglects a main plot. It just keeps jumping all over the place and never sticks with one theme. Main characters are drastically changed with no explanation or reasoning. It's ok for a freebie as a Amazon Prime customer. I would never ever pay money to watch this tragedy of a tragedy's tragedy.,1503964800,,441,4.525
8317451,1,B001L67A1E,""" - - and the winner of the award for corniest, worst film is: The House of Adam (applause).  Accepting that award
is Senor Jorge Ameer  (audience:  no encore,  por favor, no encore ! ! ).  This film was also nominated for:  worst dialog,
could be better acting and good animation ( oops, wrong film !)  As an aside,  never in the history of these awards
has any film won an incredible 10 worst awards. (applause).  A case of trying to cram too much nonsense into
a non-sensicle film.",1487203200,,484,4.348314606741573

8317455,2,B001L67A1E,"This is a movie that shows that very few people can wear so many hats on a film and get it to work. Written, directed and produced by the same person, it fails in too many ways. The acting by the man who plays Adam and by the man who owns the out-of-the-way diner, is pretty good. Unfortunately, those two characters are killed off early on in the film and what the viewer is left with is a badly acted, written,directed and edited story that is just a bit off a mess. Elements of the story are left out in the end, and one is left wondering what the hell happened. Surprisingly, I watched it all the way through....but I have no idea why.",1473638400,,639,4.161290322580645

What a piece of trash.  This man needs desperately to find a another field of work.  Nothing redeemable about it maybe it should be buried along the road side next to Mr. Ross and Adams' crappy graves.",1459296000,,426,4.170731707317073
