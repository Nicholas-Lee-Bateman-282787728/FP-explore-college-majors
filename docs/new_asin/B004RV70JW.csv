8439330,5,B004RV70JW,"Very thought provoking documentary on the advances in robotics and their use in warfare.  Balanced perspectives are presented on the morality of drone killings in Afghanistan and what implications this has on the large number of countries that possess this technology.

Best element of the video is an exploration of what is coming in the future.  I.E.  the terminator syndrome and swarm technology.  Interesting and well worth watching.",1367625600,3,437,5.367647058823529
8439331,5,B004RV70JW,"This documentary was produced in association with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and distributed by PBS.  It is a quality production.  The work gives a comprehensive look at the development and present state of various types of hardware, both airborne and terrestrial.  As I was not familiar with the state of the art, or anything even near it, I found the capabilities fascinating.  Probably even more important was the depth with which questions were raised regarding the directions defense agencies are heading in applying this hardware and possible scenarios that might result.  I must admit that I do question the legality of nonmilitary (CIA) personel remotely killing citizens in a country halfway around the world, such as Pakistan.  I have a hard time understanding where is the battlefield and less that context, where is the due process.  Without transparency in the selection process, there is no way of knowing how uniformily the rationale is applied.  To trust the CIA with sole control of the quality of its work seems delusional.  Collateral damage is another issue that needs to be reported more, because what has become known is much higher than typically first admitted to.  I can't imagine how 24 Pakistani soldiers recently got 'accidentally' killed in a single operation--clearly we are out of any reasonable control.  Well, the film did a good job of discussing these issues and, in my view, was not too soft, but fair and balanced (not the FOX News version). I highly recommend this DVD as illuminating a somewhat troubling and potentially dangerous trend (to the U.S.).",1323388800,3,1607,5.118773946360153
8439332,4,B004RV70JW,"The documentary was the best that I have seen for UAV, ROV and dilemma when it comes to robotics.  I have personally seen several of the viewed unmanned vehicles in combat, and I can say first hand that they come in handy.  I agree that the Peace Protester annoys me, but for a documentary covering all aspects of the issues, it is neccissary.  I highly reccomend this documentary for personal use, but it may be more useful for a school project.",1310256000,5,446,4.481481481481482
8439333,1,B004RV70JW,"The story is told from the perspective of the anti-war protester, code pink mindset. For me, the best part of it was watching cindy sheehan get arrested. More drones please, less of your BS opinion about why they are morally wrong without any counter argument.",1309651200,2,260,4.8
