6576991,3,B00MFVHNCU,"This movie started great - for part one, I screamed out loud a few times, there was mystery to it, well acted.

And the only thing that stayed throughout parts 2 and 3 was that it was well acted - the thrills, plot and mystery progressively went downhill until the ending was just.. well, blah.

Even my husband who tends to get lost during a full length Winnie the Pooh figured out the plot of this before the end.

And the first part was SO good... What the heck happened? it was like episodes 2 and 3 were done by a different set of writers and crew.",1505174400,2,553,4.149532710280374

6576995,5,B00MFVHNCU,I liked it and thought the actors were perfect especially Hanna and the Detective. It was a supernatural story so those who want it to make sense you will be disappointed. Supernatural is not real so it can't be logical...think of fairy tales for adults. I recommend it and I enjoyed it very much. Hanna is a very caring and loving sister to her little brother and  very sensitive to the seniors in the residential care home. The detective was a good guy and very likable. What a relief no bad language or sexual situations.,1502409600,3,524,4.515789473684211
6576996,1,B00MFVHNCU,Worst thing I have ever seen on PBS.  Total waste of time.,1501804800,,58,3.8333333333333335

6576998,4,B00MFVHNCU,"A miniseries in three episodes. A strange story concerning an old man, a really old man who is probably one hundred and ten or fifteen years old. It is a thriller in a way, of some sort, but yet it is a lot more an exotic love affair turned sour.

An old man tries to escape his own house bY bringing the social services into his business with a fake accident, so that he could escape the ghost that is living in the house with him, a possessive ghost in a way, in fact a ghost who wants to go away but cannot without him and apparently he does not want to liberate her because it means die for himself.

That ghost is jealous and to force him to do what he has to do to finish that job she will start hitting and hurting and killing all the people he may come close to in a way or another. And the exit door is nothing but a very old traditional song, slightly modified by the grandfather in law of his very evanescent wife. Guess what happened to her, right after their marriage?

The truth will come out and it will be clear that he is manipulated by the ghost, and that ghost is nowhere but in his head and it is enough for him to do what that ghost wants him to do. She is that powerful. At the same time he cannot be the killer all the time, and yet he has to be.

The police is of course impotent and helpless. A girl, in fact a young nurse, practically a rooky nurse will get involved and she is the one who will bring out the truth and the police officer, detective rather, will be the one who will witness the damage and certify the truth, and yet it will be kept silent and cool at the bottom of a cold case box.

What is good about this series is first of all the good actors, second the well cut mystery mixing some Indian folklore to plain superstition, and third the cool pace of a hectic fable that is supposed to suspend us and our disbelief over a slow fire burning our feet with fear. And they do burn with rage, our feet.

Entertaining and just a little bit stressful.

8672006,5,B00MFVHNCU,I've watch this three time already.  The characters in this movie are well done.  I could feel with the characters.  The haunting effect was great.,1521417600,,147,4.8
8672007,3,B00MFVHNCU,"I found this story very boring and predictable.
I struggled to watch to the end...can't win 'em all, I guess.
No mystery or intrigue and the camera angles when shooting the ""visitor"" from the past disappointing.
I really do not have one good thing to say about this dvd.",1515369600,,270,4.530612244897959
8672008,5,B00MFVHNCU,"Very interesting storyline.  Suspenseful.  Enjoyed it very much.  No downtime or dragging in the script. Very well paced.  Excellent acting, as well.",1510272000,,149,5.636363636363637

8672013,4,B00MFVHNCU,"I enjoyed this DVD, but I think it is more of a ghost story than a mystery. I was a little disappointed when it departed into implausible twists and turns,
since I was expecting a mystery.",1506643200,,188,4.25
8672014,4,B00MFVHNCU,"Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this very atmospheric, slow-building, creepy thriller. And it makes so much more sense to me now, than when I initially saw it (I missed most of the first episode when it aired on PBS), and I was left scratching my head, while trying to figure everything out. But I loved what I did catch on TV and knew I had to see it from the beginning, so I decided to buy it. One thing I particularly enjoyed is that it's not your typical horror story, and I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to ""Scarborough Fair"", the same way ever again.",1505692800,,572,4.162162162162162
