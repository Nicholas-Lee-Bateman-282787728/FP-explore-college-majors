2928766,5,B000V3JGGK,"THIS IS THE BEST SEASON OUT OF THE THREE.  SOME OF MY FAVORITE EPISODES ARE IN THIS LAST SEASON.  THIS SEASON HAS ALOT OF COOL GUEST STARS AND THE MAIN REASON IS THAT RICHARD DONNER DIRECTS ALOT OF THE EPISODES.  IT IS NOT SO MUCH GOOD AGAINST BAD, INSTEAD THE STORIES HAVE TWISTS TO THEM AND GREAT CAMERA WORK.  RICHARD DONNER WOULD GO ON TO DIRECT THE LETHAL WEAPON MOVIES AND SUPERMAN.",1194566400,13,388,4.347222222222222
2928775,5,B000V3JGGK,I had forgotten about this three year run series. You won't be able to watch just one episode. Great show.,1394409600,,106,4.35
2928776,1,B000V3JGGK,"This bad review is for the discs and NOT the content. The six discs contained only four episodes on five and three episodes on the sixth disc. The cases stated there should have been seven episodes on five discs and three on the sixth--plus special features. The labels also stated the higher episode numbers. These discs were missing almost half the advertised content; and there were no special features. This looks like I received a bootlegged package! By-the-way, I checked the reviews after I could make no sense of this and there is another user with the same problem.",1389398400,,574,4.808080808080808
2928777,5,B000V3JGGK,Unfortunately this was the third and final season.  Steve McQueen was slated for bigger and better things in the film world thus the short run of this show.  This show with its violence had plenty of humour to off set the violent scenes.  Again a very well produced show.  An excellent series to own.,1383955200,,300,4.5

2928780,5,B000V3JGGK,"Wanted Dead or Alive is an excellent Western series. It is well produced and I could only wish it to have been for more Seasons.
Amazon prices are excellent and overseas postage is cheap. Many thanks for a quick, efficient sale. Jim.",1290038400,,233,4.571428571428571
2928781,3,B000V3JGGK,"I have watched all three season of this show.  The first season was fantastic and the second was even better for the most part.  The episodes were unique and not as simplistic as many westerns from this era were.  However in season three it is as if the writers started to run out of ideas and instead of rehashing the old stuff, they went in a new direction.  There are way too many ""comedy"" episodes.  I just don't think this show worked well as a comedy and the the Josh Randall character seemed like a completely different person in these episodes.  The worst one was probably Baa-Baa (he is trying to find someone's lost pet sheep) and Detour wasn't much better (trying to help someone elope with a girl).  I was sad to be finishing this series because I really enjoyed it, but the mixed quality of season 3 has made the ending a little easier.",1287446400,3,849,4.403846153846154
2928782,5,B000V3JGGK,"Steve McQueen hit the big time with this series that lasted 3 seasons on TV. He portrays a bounty hunter in the Old West. He has good morals, good manners, shoots straight, and treats his horse well.
  I got the first two season sets (from 2 different video outlets), but was having difficulty finding the 3rd and final set, until I looked on Amazon. There it was, offered by a private party at a price less than I paid for each of the 1st two sets. When it arrived, it was still in the original packing, in mint condition.",1273622400,,523,4.2727272727272725

2928795,5,B000V3JGGK,We now own all three seasons of Wanted: Dead or Alive starring Steve McQueen. If you like this actor then you will definately like these shows.  You have to see them to appreciate the black and white westerns.  A must have if you're a fan.  Enjoy....,1256601600,,250,4.391304347826087
2928796,5,B000V3JGGK,The service was quick.  Series was exactly what they described. I look forward to ordering again.  Thank You so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1256169600,,130,5.45
2928797,5,B000V3JGGK,Steve McQueen fans will have to have it!  A terrific collection of early McQueen from the classic Western television series - great fun!,1254096000,,136,4.913043478260869
2928798,5,B000V3JGGK,"I recently aquired a copy of Wanted:Dead or Alive. As I Live in New Zealand we didn't get this programme here so I've just seen it for the first time and absolutely love it. Steve McQueen was one of the great actors and this series is just fantastic. Im glad I got to see it. Love that ""Mare's Leg"". I'm a collector of western movies and have over 100 of them and this show would be one of my favorites. Right up there with ""The High Chapparal"" which I'm waiting for.
Wanted""Dead or Alive is must watch western and I highly reccommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre.",1252108800,,569,4.229357798165138
2928799,5,B000V3JGGK,"I pretty much thought this show would be another cheesy western tv series filmed in the late 50s, but I wanted to see it anyway because I love Steve McQueen (the King of Cool). I was SHOCKED to see such high caliber action scenes and acting. The story lines are great. The show will have you on the edge of your seat wondering ""how will our hero make it out of this jam."" Although they recycle the same characters over and over, it is worth the watch, each episode. I bought season 1 first, then could not wait to see season 2 and 3. I see now why Steve McQueen was so popular. He makes acting look so easy!",1244937600,,607,4.109243697478991
2928800,5,B000V3JGGK,"This is a nice set, the only complaint I have is getting to the menu on each disk,  as the company commericals that you have to put up with to get there are truly obnoxious.

Season three is by far the best of the series. No other actor I've ever watched was as good on film as McQueen, and that skill blooms right here in these episodes. He was the lead, the star, and the camera is his. This was evident in the first two seasons to a lesser degree, but Steve owns his craft in this third, final, season. Good guest stars as well, but McQueen is what makes this worth watching.",1239753600,,578,4.106194690265487
2928801,1,B000V3JGGK,"Only half of the episods of season three were sent. The box clearly shows all the episods of season three that I did not receive. I need a refund, as I was cheated!",1229385600,,164,4.0
2928802,4,B000V3JGGK,Very good acting...great scripts. Takes too long to get the DVD to play. Too many company names before you get to the main menu.,1228089600,,128,4.375
2928803,5,B000V3JGGK,This is a great old series.  So many young actors just beginning are in the shows.  A good series to have in your collection.,1211760000,,125,4.166666666666667
2928804,5,B000V3JGGK,Great tv western. Steve McQueen starred in this series and gave him a chance to become a major star.,1207612800,,100,4.315789473684211
2928805,4,B000V3JGGK,I love this show and I love Steve McQueen.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the DVD episodes are in black and white yet the episodes on TV are colorized.,1205971200,,156,3.727272727272727
2928806,5,B000V3JGGK,"This third complete year set of Wanted Dead or Alive is just as fantastic as the first two years.  The sound and picture quality is excellent.  I noticed a few differences in this third year set.  There is a new video opening to the show.....he has a new hat.....he seems to wear his gun belt less, sometimes draped over his shoulder, or over the horn on his saddle.....there seems to be less violence and a little more humor.  I highly recommend this DVD set.",1201737600,4,460,4.440476190476191

2928809,5,B000V3JGGK,"Steven McQueen's 1st year series was quite good, but he
was rather stiff in the role. Season 3 series is excellent
and find that McQueen had found his role rather more comfortable
and his acting ability rose. This is a must get series for the
western aficionado.",1197590400,6,262,4.595744680851064

2928812,5,B000V3JGGK,"One of the most memorable and famous characters of the '50's Western genre was Steve McQueen's ""Josh Randall"", who spoke softly (with the Southern drawl he cultivated in his early days roaming around the South, particularly Myrtle Beach, S.C.) and carried a Big Gun, the sawed-off Winchester lever-action rifle then known as the ""Mare's Laig"". I remember the excitement each week eagerly waiting for each episode of this great Western.
It's release on DVD has been just too long a wait! It's great to finally have ALL of this fine show! It's just too bad there wasn't more of it, and that we'll not see the likes of it again!
One of my fondest childhood memories was the weekend I spent with my Dad, helping him to hand make my own custom-made leather belt rig from scratch for my toy ""Mare's Laig"" in time for use as part of a Halloween costume when the plastic original proved to be a poor replica.
With all the second- and third-rate wastage flooding the DVD market lately, it's really great to see SOMEBODY bring back such a great actor in this really great Western!",1195776000,14,1070,4.607329842931938
2928813,5,B000V3JGGK,"I just received WDOA Season 3 and have seen the first four episodes.  If these episodes are any indication season 3 is the best of the 3.

2928814,5,B000V3JGGK,"STEVE MCQUEEN...He had that something...""SPECIAL""... that can take a simple story and turn it into a...""MUST SEE""...production!! Wanted Dead or Alive is a perfect example of just how GREAT an actor he was...This program had Very Talented Writers and Wonderful Costars. But... I can only compare how you feel when MCQUEEN does his thing, to the times I saw TED WILLIAMS come to bat!! You just know that something ""VERY SPECIAL"" is about to happen!! I don't care what you pay for these DVD's, it's worth every penny....DON'T MISS IT!!!!",1194566400,13,534,4.944444444444445
