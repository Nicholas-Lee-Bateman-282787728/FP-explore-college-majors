8674437,1,B00281DXKI,"I was planning on using this dvd to supplement my Social Studies curriculum since the content sounded age appropriate and interesting. The DVD was badly damaged when I received it a while back - it had come off it's clip in the box and got badly scratched ... so only plays about 6 min of the content. I only opened it recently (Since I am only now teaching this content) , an error on my part since I received it a  few months ago. Ideally I would appreciate a refund . In the mean time I will order another one and hope the same packaging problem does not re-occur.

Second dvd arrived the same way , off the center clip and scratched !!!!",1485734400,,641,4.203252032520325
