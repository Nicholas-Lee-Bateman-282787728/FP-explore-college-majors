Memo lived and died a gangster but wasn't always so he just loved lowrider clubs and fly women and hanging with his homeboys! Now Memo's Mom and Dad were  O' G's. He never had a chance he was heading down that road whether he knew or not! Memo died in a gang fight!
Tommy lived and died playing football. Tommy's Dad was all three of ours, (Memo, Tommy, and Eric) Pee Wee football coach. I'm Eric. We met playing football. But I left the team to pursue boxing 2 time Golden Glove runner up! What can I say there was a lot of opponents in my weight class light welter weight! But what kept us together was I was the one blessed with a lot of pretty girl cousins and all there friends were hot! Tommy just loved football and girls and hanging out at my place. Tommy died playing college football after a game he developed a serious blood clot!",1433548800,,985,4.353260869565218
