8333373,5,B001PIHP22,"The Case of the Howling Dog

Arthur Cartwright visits Perry Mason to see about a dog and a will. Perry explains what makes a will valid in their state. Cartwright hates to hear a howling dog because it means death in the neighborhood. Perry explains how he will avoid a malicious prosecution suit: they will see a deputy district attorney to issue a warning (Chapter I). Clinton Foley, the neighbor, visits the deputy DA and charges that Cartwright is mentally deranged; Foley's dog doesn't howl. Deputy Sheriff Pemberton will personally investigate this conflict (Chapter III). The housekeeper and cook say the police dog Prince didn't make noise. But Foley finds a note - his wife has run away with Cartwright (Chapter IV)! Cartwright left home last night and never returned (Chapter V). Perry orders Paul Drake to investigate Foley and Cartwright; he suspects there is something going on (Chapter VI). Paul Drake reports on the identity of Foley and his wife - shocking news (Chapter VII)! Perry calls Foley to discuss the situation at a 9 pm meeting.

When Perry arrives at Foley's home he finds the dog dead, and Foley's body. He calls the police (Chapter VIII). Sergeant Holcomb questions Perry about his appointment. Perry points out that his lack of an alibi shows he had no foreknowledge. A perfect alibi should be suspicious (Chapter IX). Paul Drake's men locate the taxi driver who brought a visitor to Foley's home earlier (Chapter XI). When they locate Bessie Forbes, Perry visits her and gives her advice (Chapter XII). Perry retrieves a handkerchief, and call Sergeant Holcomb to turn it in as the owner visited Foley's home around the time of his death (Chapter XIII). Perry's clever misdirection points to the Breedmont Hotel.

Perry confers with Bessie Forbes and hears her story. Perry tells he she can't afford to lie about her call on Foley, and can't afford to tell the truth. Bessie must not answer any questions unless her lawyer is present. The police show up next to arrest Bessie, and warn her that anything she says can be used against her (the ""Miranda warning"" in 1934). Della and Perry discuss the case (Chapter XV). Perry explains that a defense lawyer presents the facts in favor of the defendant against the powers of the state. Perry must strike at just the right time to free his client. First he must build up sympathy in the newspapers. Perry's case will depend on that howling dog! The police traced the gun to Bessie Forbes, bought over a year ago.

Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate the alibi of Thelma Benton, Foley's housekeeper. Her hand is still bandaged from a dog bite. Perry uses a ruse to
question her (Chapter XVI). The trial starts in Chapter XVII. Perry cross-examines the taxi driver who brought Bessie Forbes to the Foley home; he was coached by the district attorney. Perry plays another fast trick, skating on thin ice because he has to do it (Chapter XVIII). Perry explains the fickleness of the mass mind and how he will use it (Chapter XX). The cross-examination of Thelma Barton is interrupted with startling news! Perry argues for his client, and the jury returns with 'not guilty' in Chapter XXI. In the next chapter Perry explains it all, a happy ending; we learn why that dog didn't howl. Perry would not accept a dismissal; justice was served, not the letter of the law. The language reflects the manners of that time.",1507420800,,3386,4.802744425385935
