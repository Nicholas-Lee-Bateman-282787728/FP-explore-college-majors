4460004,4,B004RA7XX6,"That's What I Am is a tricky movie to rate. My wife didn't like it much, but I did -- and for totally different reasons. Let's talk about different aspects that were good and bad.

The Good:

Story
-----
The story is quite good and, for many people, easily relatable. A boy who is on the verge of being one of the ""cool"" kids has a choice to make. He can do what is right and end up with the nerds (i.e. those who will succeed) or do what is wrong and be liked by the bad boys and, better yet, the bad girls.

As with many of us, his destiny is written by how he toys around with the sides of good and evil in middle school.

Homosexual Message
------------------
Tons of people will probably have lots to say about the homosexual message in the film. There's no overt gross stuff to show you in either homo- or heterosexual (I think there may be one kiss in the whole film and its heterosexual). But the film deals in part with homophobia as a tool to get across a message:  Our public actions determine how we ought to be respected in a public setting. We can find fault with anyone, and it tends to be those with glaring faults who seem to get caught up in listing everyone else's.

If you are pro-homosexual, anti-homosexual or don't care, I think you'll find the message mostly unoffensive and even inspire conversation in your house (as it did ours).

Ed Harris
---------
He sticks out like a sore thumb. He's such a brilliantly good actor and he gets you caught up in every scene. The directors and writers use him brilliantly to move you with the plot. And he commands such authority that it's easy to see him as the sage teacher he portrays.

The Not-So-Good:

Acting
------
Most of the actors in the film are children. And most of it is pretty rough. The lead actors are decent for the most part. But don't expect anything more than you'd find on mid-day Disney.

The Conclusion(s)
-----------------
The movie ends a few too many times in a few too many places. The first time I thought the movie was ending was a full 30 minutes before it did. And then it skipped around a few endind points in the last 5 or 10 minutes. It's quite forgivable though, because they just keep tying off all of the loose ends. And the ending ending (as opposed to the non-ending endings) is quite enjoyable.

Overall:
Honestly, I'd never buy this film even though I liked it. It's probably a one-time-watch film. But I was glad that I did see it.",1306886400,14,2436,4.331868131868132
4460035,5,B004RA7XX6,Came across this movie on tv one night and had to buy it! I have shared it with many friends & family and all have liked it. It shows how truly insidious prejudice and assumptions can be and the integrity of some in the face of that.,1441152000,,233,3.978723404255319

Stanley's ear make-up is a bit overdone, but that's the nature of the script, not the fault of the production. The young actors are well chosen and play their parts very well. I'm sure Ed Harris was a good influence on them.",1436832000,,321,4.4576271186440675

4460043,2,B004RA7XX6,"I really dislike anachronistic movies.  I compared notes with my wife and we both agreed that, in many fundamental ways, this depiction of a past era,  did not remind us much of our own life at school in the early 1960's.  Young people at our schools about that time were just not as cruel, or stupid, as the bullies depicted here.  We had little experience of crass and violent bullying and the ""kids"" didn't  use phrases such as ""OMG!"" in those days.  This all seemed stilted and very unconvincing. That's a very great pity because we would love to see that era accurately portrayed with depth and without pushing, in additon,  predictable ""liberal"" agenda items.

It seems to me this is just one more movie that was spawned by someone who very badly recalled that era, or didn't actually live through it.  Particularly odious to me was the attempt to compare people shunned at school for inconsequential reasons, such as personal appearance, (or because they are more studious than others etc), with someone whose sexual orientation is biologically unnatural in the considered opinion of so many others, today as then.",1410393600,2,1121,4.8578947368421055

4460069,5,B004RA7XX6,I really enjoyed this film. Nice story about bullying and what is really important in life. I have to say that the young man playing the Big G did a great job. Ed Harris and Amy Madigan were outstanding as always.,1392854400,,213,4.219512195121951
4460070,4,B004RA7XX6,"Marvelous movie about tollerance of people who are ""different.""  Ed Harris's performance is excellent.  Very well written.  Be sure to watch the ending credits...they are very funny!",1392422400,,182,5.666666666666667
4460071,4,B004RA7XX6,"This is a movie with a message, but does not get too carried away with getting the message across.
The message is stated in the synopsis on the DVD case; ""tolerance takes courage"".
To get this message across the storyline has some strange characters: Stanley who is the biggest kid in the school, yet gets bullied; Mr. Simon, who will not defend himself when a student he got expelled makes accusations which could ruin him; and Andy, the main character, who gets caught in the middle and must make some decisions which would be very hard for an eight grader.
The movie is seen mainly from Andy's point of view, which helps the viewer understand the difficulty he has in making his discussions.
This is a ""coming-of-age"" movie, but is this case the coming-of-age is not just Andy's dealing with his first love, but also maturing in other ways, such as understanding tolerance and courage.
Be sure and watch the credits at the end of the movie because while the credits are running it also has a ""where are they now"" feature which is fun.",1388707200,,1037,4.610810810810811
4460072,5,B004RA7XX6,"Wonderful acting by Ed Harris and Amy Madigan.  I thought the child actors did a very credible job portraying the aches and pains and joys of adolescence.  Although the story about tolerance and Mr. Simon's brave and painful decision to leave his teaching position are certainly noteworthy, what struck me was the student's question at the end and his statement that ""I didn't come here about that"" vis-a-vis whether his teacher was gay.  At this point you realize what a wonderful teacher Mr. Simon was.",1388707200,,504,4.905882352941177
4460073,4,B004RA7XX6,"THAT'S WHAT I AM is a coming of age story about heroism. The main character learns to stand up for those less popular than himself; ""a nerdy"" kid, takes a stand both physically as well as artistically;a beloved teacher refuses to lower himself to the bigoted accusations of a cretanish parent. A lovely film, beautifully acted by all, for all to see.",1387843200,,350,4.661290322580645
4460074,5,B004RA7XX6,"I really like this movie! I got this movie because my favorite superstar, Randy Orton, was in the movie! RKOOOO!!!",1373932800,,114,4.75
4460075,5,B004RA7XX6,this movie was made by the wwe and i liked it it has randy orton in it and ed harris it is a very good movie to watch also other wwe movies are coming out soon with maybe the miz in it and other wwe superstars,1372550400,,209,3.5652173913043477
4460076,5,B004RA7XX6,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this film.  We wanted to find some movies that we could show to my cousin's 11 year old son who is coming to live with us (a gay couple) that might help him better understand how to be tolerant and accepting of others who are different.  ""That's What I Am"" definitely does a good job in communicating that, using a story-telling style that reminds me of the ABC After-school Specials but with far better acting, writing and production values.  The presentation of tolerance is nicely, though very simply (too simply) framed, but that makes it all the more understandable for an adolescent.

Ed Harris is very good as Mr. Simon, the favorite English teacher.  Though the portrayal is a bit cartoonish at times, it fits with the overall style of the movie.  Chase Ellison is great as the student, Andy, that Mr. Simon nudges into befriending a school outcast.  Supporting roles are well-cast with the exception of pro wrestler Randy Orton, who plays the father of another student (a bully) who threatens to out Mr. Simon as a homosexual based solely on rumor.  Orton is neither an actor nor does he seem comfortable playing his role in this period piece set in the late 1960s.  The film was produced by WWE Studios, so presumably this was a vehicle built at least in part around him... and that's unfortunate.  He comes off as a pro wrestler who can't act playing a role that could have been done by any number of others so much better.

Something that I notable about this film is that it serves as a reminder of, back in the 60s (as well as for years afterward) how easily a person's life could be ruined simply based on the rumor of the person being gay.  I totally appreciated that, but at the same time as we look to help an 11-year-old feel more comfortable living with two dads now, this film is not the place to start.  Only when he is able to understand the context of the period in time in which the story takes place will he benefit from this aspect of the film.

Lastly, since was in grade school during the 1960s, I really enjoyed the look of the film.  The production design takes great care to be true to the era, from cars to clothes, to home decor, to the old reel lawn mower Andy pushes around.  It was fun to watch just for that.",1369180800,,2292,4.421428571428572
4460077,4,B004RA7XX6,"This movie is based on a true story of bullies, heroes, and an amazing teacher who brings them all together with his love for teaching.

4460079,5,B004RA7XX6,"This is a well written, well acted powerful story about a boy coming of age. I think it's an excellent movie to watch with your pre-teens and teenagers. It is set in 1965 when things were a lot different than today but the message doesn't change. Human Dignity + Compassion = Peace. I watched it and after doing so it took me back to that time in my life and it made me do some soul searching of my own. I asked myself how many times I may have hurt someone's feelings maybe without even realizing it.

Someone mentioned that the teacher Mr. Simon addressed the rumours of his being homosexual by simply quitting. There's so much more than that. He realized that if he didn't quit or deny the allegations it wouldn't just be him he'd be affecting it would be his dear friend the principal who was trying to keep her job as the first female principal and trying to put two boys through college. He took the high road and decided to save her job by leaving his.

I think everyone should watch this film and if I was a teacher I'd actually show it to my class. It carries a powerful message.",1364515200,3,1088,4.276699029126213
4460080,4,B004RA7XX6,I am a teacher of middle school students.  We have a class on anti-bullying/tolerance that we all teach.

The movie showed how some of the kids eventually went on to become writers, parents and convicted felon (of course your daily decisions factor a lot in your destiny.) I think the movie shows that everyone was made for a different destiny and purpose. I rented this movie and it was enough. It is not worth the full price that amazon is asking for it. I would consider a purchase at six dollars. No more. I don't think this movie is of course representative of everyone's childhood. Some kids have never been to school dances or the prom.

4460102,3,B004RA7XX6,"This is a well intentioned movie. It strives to champion the better of human values but it just falls short.

Here's the scoop. Ed Harris is an 8th grade English teacher. He pairs up students in his class for their final assignment. One pair consists of the narrator, a thoughtful, bright semi-outsider and a too tall, elephant eared major outsider. This pairing gives both boys a new and different view of life. This is a brief outline, but the sub stories all fall under this banner.

As in all schools you have the ""in"" kids, the ""geeks"", the homely and nondescript. A representation of each group are brought into the outline, but much of it (too much of it) is cliche. Other than ""Big G"" the geek, there were no characters you haven't seen before any number of times. And many of the plot points beg for a Hollywood treatment. The producers here tried, valiantly, to avoid this and it didn't work. The high points weren't high enough and the quieter parts were just blah. And they screwed up other rudimentary aspects as well. This is set in the early 60s yet the the characters speak using phrases that have only come into vogue recently. And during a talent show, some kids perform in a rock band using instruments that didn't exist at the time. Not a big deal I suppose but it stuck out to me.

This movie has a good heart but it missed the mark on too many levels. It's not a bad watch but it could have been so much better.",1319068800,4,1433,4.4

4460106,4,B004RA7XX6,"Andrew Nichol narrates this story about his younger self (Chase Ellison) being a 12 year old student who was is pared with Stanley a.k.a. ""Big G"" (Alexander Walters) for a school project by his teacher Mr. Simon (Ed Harris) to do a short story on tolerance.  Stanley is the school's biggest outcast due to his size including one incident where he was sprayed with a water gun to make it look like he wet his pants & always hung out at a section of the school called ""Geek Corner"" with the other outcast of the school.  Despite Stanley always keep his self-respect, Andrew didn't understand why he let people pick on him while Stanley's best friend Norman (Daniel Yelsky) would always get mad at him for doing things he felt that would just get them picked on more.  Along with having to do the assignment with Stanley, Andrew is also dealing with his father who is constantly on his case for not being able to do anything correct by his standards while develops a crush on Mary Clear (Mia Rose Frampton) who had her best friend tell him that she likes him as well.  That didn't set well with Mary's last boyfriend in Ricky Brown (Jordan Reynolds) who's the school bully & keeps threatening Andrew to stay away from Mary.  While all of this is going on, Mr. Simon is the most popular teacher in the school & even won the California Teacher Of The Year as he's very loved by his students but after an incident involving a student named Jason (Camille Bourgeois) that caused him to get suspended, he started spreading a rumor about Mr. Simon being a homosexual causing Jason's father (played by WWE superstar Randy Orton) to bring allegations against him with Mr. Simon refusing to comment stating that his teaching should stand on it's own.

This was definitely a different type of film that we've gotten from WWE in the past as they put their own superstars in the background (Randy Orton only appeared in for maybe 10 mins. total) & did a family drama that focused on real issues as bullying, tolerance, and acceptance.  Ed Harris was top notch like always while all the children performed really well so this is a movie that I would go out of your way to see.",1313712000,21,2160,4.5372750642673525
