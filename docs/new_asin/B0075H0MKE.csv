Thats not to say it isn't lacking. There is a lot more that could have been said on this topic, and it could have had a part 2 or even three. Also, there was a verse used by the pastor that wasn't the correct use or rendering thus falling short to prove its intent for that particular point. It could be because the pastor may be using a corrupt ""translation"" of the Bible. Non the less, I did enjoy this dvd and would still recommend it regardless of its short comings",1331769600,,620,4.262711864406779
