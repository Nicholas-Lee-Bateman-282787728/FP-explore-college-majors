8391206,5,B0038BW3EO,"Great Fun, been a fan of O'Hanlon for years. DVD only works on non-American players so you need proper device. Item delivered well before expected timeframe. Will do business with vendor again.",1404259200,,193,5.0625
8391207,5,B0038BW3EO,"This is simply the best season in the series.  ""Pet Rescue,"" about the conversations between George and that little dog are absolutely hilarious.  I live in the US (so I do not have a PAL format DVD player), but I was able to play this DVD perfectly in my notebook computer.  I mention that so other American fans of this show will be able to watch it in the PAL format since it was never released for the USA.  The packaging and shipping were superb.  I got the DVD in perfect condition and in record time.",1359936000,,507,4.239583333333333
8391208,5,B0038BW3EO,"Oh, those Brits and their whimsical humor. One of my favorite sitcoms is BBC's MY HERO, a half-hour series that comically explores the domestic misadventures of Thermoman (Ardal O'Hanlon), dimwit alien superhero from the planet Ultron. When not performing feats of world-saving import, Thermoman, in his guise as mild-mannered shop owner George Sunday, strives to live the humdrum life of the average British subject. Series 3, with its ten madcap episodes, ushers in the new addition to the Sunday household: George and his wife Janet's baby boy. Episode One deals with, among other things, the baby's as yet undetermined name: Will it be ""Pontius Ulrich Sunday"" or ""Benjamin""? (It's actually Ollie, short for Apollo 11.) George and Janet (particulary Janet) find themselves at wit's end coping with young Ollie's precocious ways, what with his having taken after his da. One day after his birth, and Ollie is already conversing with the 'rents and zooming around the room. On the plus side, his poo does smell like strawberries and cream.

MY HERO ran from 2000 to 2006, and I'm amazed but glad that the U.S. hadn't yet picked it up to bastardize. As ever, Irish comedian Ardal O'Hanlon is fantastic, but, really, so is the rest of the cast. You'll be glad to hear that O'Hanlon's Thermoman enters new realms of obliviousness as he's still suffering from a serious case of culture clash. It's not that he's a simpleton, really. Thermoman is, in fact, innately very intelligent. It's just that he just can't seem to get a firm grip on Earthly customs, and his goof-ups are then perceived as stupidity. Thermoman is so very literal, and his lack of tact keeps landing him in hot water and often results in demented plot situations.

The lovely Emily Joyce, playing the long-suffering, understanding Janet, continues her run as the show's unsung heroine. But the secret weapon is Geraldine McNulty as the miserable receptionist Mrs. Raven. The zingers are wicked fun and constant, with the diabolical Mrs. Raven and George hogging the most choice one-liners. And the baby shifts the group dynamics and adds new dimensions of humor. He's very cute, and it tickles me each time fully constructed sentences come out of his mouth. And, yes, young Ollie does demonstrate that he's more worldly than his da.

Although Series One and Two are available on DVD, in Region 1 format, Series 3 - broken up in two volumes - is still only available in Region 2, so you'll need an All Region (or is it Regions Free?) DVD player. MY HERO Series 3, Vol. 1 contains the first five episodes of Series 3:

- Episode 1 - ""Baby Talk"" - George and a distraught Janet try to keep the baby's superhuman tendencies on the hush hush, especially when Janet's parents come over to see their precious grandson for the first time.

- Episode 2 - ""Zero Tolerance"" - George joins the neighborhood watch and goes overboard with reporting minor infractions.

- Episode 3 - ""Pet Rescue"" - Despite his fear of dogs, George is coerced into dogsitting the in-laws' family pet, Biggles. To overcome his phobia, George sends away for a gadget advertised in Superhero Monthly which will allow him to communicate with animals. Also, Mrs. Raven's habitual and epic rudeness finally catches up to her.

- Episode 4 - ""The Older Man"" - On his 327th birthday, George's human body begins to rapidly deteriorate, forcing him to drastic measures to ensure that Janet doesn't lose interest in him.

- Episode 5 - ""Putting on the Writs"" - When Mrs. Raven is inadvertently sent plummeting off the roof of a supermarket structure and Thermoman rescues her, she ends up suing him for alleged injuries incurred.

And if you get your mitts on MY HERO Series 3, Volume 2, here are the contents:

- Episode 6 - ""Shock, Horror!"" - Concern over the baby's high temperature takes a toll on George's superheroing. One fallout: a sleazy tabloid newspaperman captures a photo of Thermoman caught in George and Janet's home. Oh, the escalating headlines, as George feverishly tries to salvage the situation.

- Episode 7 - ""Little Green Man"" - When Arnie shares his cake with Janet, thus inadvertently breaking a sacred convention of Ultron marriage, George literally turns green with envy.

- Episode 8 - ""Mine's A Double"" - Scheduled to attend an Ultron superhero function, George introduces Janet to his replacement double.

- Episode 9 - ""A Little Learning"" - George's unending social blunders compel him to fly back to Ultron for a remedy. He returns to Earth knowing everything about everything and, as a result, is now more polished in his casual conversations with humans. But, and we saw this coming, the remedy has nasty side effects.

- Episode 10 - ""A Day to Remember"" - George loses his memory just as a hurtling meteor threatens to annihilate all life on Earth. Or is he just pretending so he can get out of changing the baby's nappies?

8391209,4,B0038BW3EO,"Season Three was one of the best seasons of My Hero, and it's easy to see why. All the characters are back, with more. Arnie actually moves to Northolt, and we have George and Janet's half-Ultronian baby ""Apollo 11"", or ""Ollie"" for short. Now, as for the episodes:
""Baby Talk""-The couple struggle with the new baby, arguing over his name and having a talk about acting like a human baby.
Best Quote-Ella on one of the baby photos of Ollie: ""Here he is...eating a slice of pizza.""
""Zero Tolerance""-George becomes obsessed with helping the police after joining the Neighbourhood Watch, and it annoys everyone.
Best Moment: George calling the police after hearing Mrs Raven has stolen from Piers and challenging George about it.
""Pet Rescue""-Janet and George look after Ella and Stanley's dog, and George discovers the dog's name is Malcolm and he hates his owners and is in love with Janet. Meanwhile, Mrs Raven is fired.
Best Quote: Malcolm on Ella and Stanley: ""They made me wear this stupid coat...other dogs think I'm gay.""
""The Older Man""-George's birthday makes him physically prematurely age while Piers falls in love with part-time nurse Hayley.
Best Moment: Everything with Hayley. Also Mrs Raven on Hayley: ""What a bitch! Right, she's gotta go. I'm the only bitch round here.""
""Puttin' On The Writs""-Probably the worst episode, but with some good moments. Mrs Raven sues Thermoman for spraining her arm after he saves her from falling off the top of the supermarket carpark.
Best Moments: Everything with Sammy the scorpion.",1315180800,,1532,4.98828125
