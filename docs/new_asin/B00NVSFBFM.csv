8680507,2,B00NVSFBFM,"I agree with another reviewer that the acting could have been much better, as could the filming.  It looked rather low-budget.  The message was a great one...we each need to hold on to the measure of faith that God has given us, for if we hold on to our faith, God can and will do amazing things. I just wish the vehicle for the message had been a better one.",1504828800,,359,4.114285714285714

8680513,1,B00NVSFBFM,We turned this off after the first 10 minutes because the acting and low budget camera work was horrible. I can shoot better video with my cell phone camera. Don't waste your money!,1426896000,,181,4.515151515151516
