My kids have not gotten to enjoy it like I did because the vhs machine doesn't work, and the dvd is too pricey.  I will keep searching for this DVD elseware.  But the movie itself is good.

1193915,5,B000006FY9,"Anybody (like me) who has actually read the E.T.A. Hoffmann story Nuknacker und Mauseknig will recognize that its period setting, major themes and characters remain mostly intact. Many of the characters' lines, actions, and dilemmas are lifted straight from the original. Well done! Even Tchaikovsky's music written for the famous ballet was not too severely rearranged.

Some melding with the ballet was done, with generally good results. There of course had to be some story trimming here & there, and some sugar-coating to keep the story and action kid-friendly and not too frightening by the sensibilities of the day. Today, 25 years after its production, the PC crowd would probably deem it too violent and threatening--there's weapons like swords & cannons fer gosh sake! Oh the horror! At least Clara is still a scrapper, if not more so than Marie in the original.

The only quibble is that the story has the obligatory ""I can't stay in fairyland"" resolution that has been plaguing kid-fantasy adaptations since the Baum-to-MGM rewrite of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and the like. But it ends well and believably for all that. Highly recommended!

BTW a very few have complained that it might be too intense for toddlers. Well, duh; exercise a little parental guidance. 200 years ago, story-telling had different sensibilities in Germany, and though Hoffmann might have been a little outre, he was not as dark as the Brothers Grimm. Again, this animated version follows Hoffmann's original tale Nutcracker and Mouse-King, NOT the distantly-related popular ballet. Be advised. And sure, for kids 5 years and older might be preferable, in the arms of a loving and comforting parent.",1395273600,2,1688,5.130909090909091
1193916,5,B000006FY9,"I watched this when I was little, and years later managed to track it down. Discovered I still knew the words to the movie even after all these years! A fun Christmas movie and while not overbearingly filled with classical music, has enough and also enough of a similarity to the original Nutcracker story to be fun for purists too. Plus, Jack Bauer was in it as a kid, and Phyllis Diller is the rat queen. What more could you want?",1394755200,,432,4.345679012345679
1193917,4,B000006FY9,"Clara, a young girl in the 19th century, receives a nutcracker at her Christmas Eve party that she becomes very attached to. Her mysterious and magical godfather, Uncle Drosselmeier, tells her the fairytale-like story of how the Nutcracker came to be, and later that night, she has her own encounter with the villain of the story, the evil Mouse King! Her Nutcracker comes to life to defend Clara and her dolls, but before this first battle is over, Clara is injured. Later on, the battle continues, and Clara is whisked away to the land of the dolls before everything is finally put right again!

""The Nutcracker Prince"" is an animated feature from 1990 and released by Warner Bros. It seems to be quite beloved by those who grew up with it. Personally, I watch a lot of animation, and I am not totally blown away by this particular feature. Animation wise, it leaves a lot to be desired, though it is not terrible. The voice acting varies. We all love Kiefer Sutherland, but he is rather bland in the title role of this film. Megan Follows as Clara is not bad at all. The story tries to be pretty close to the original Nutcracker story by E.T.A. Hoffmann, and it is really good in this regard (this may throw off those who are only familiar with the ballet though). I guess when you combine that with the beautiful music by Tchaikovsky, you can forgive the film for having mediocre, or at least uneven animation (and I'm not talking about how the Princess Pirlipat sequence is done in a different style; I get and enjoy that). Overall, this is no Disney Renaissance feature, but it does manage to be a charming little holiday film for when you're in that Nutcracker mood but not ready for the full on ballet version. For that, though it is very unique, I recommend ""Nutcracker: The Motion Picture"", the version featuring the Pacific Northwest Ballet with designs by illustator Maurice Sendak.

Now, a word about this DVD release. We are given The Nutcracker Prince on DVD from Goodtimes Entertainment, and it is not exactly a spectacular release. There are no bonus features, and the film is in fullscreen. I don't know what the original aspect ratio was, but surely it was widescreen. I hear overseas releases came with the trailer, but we get none here. Hopefully, this film will get a Blu-Ray release someday that at least addresses those issues.",1389052800,,2351,4.676328502415459

1193945,5,B000006FY9,"The Nutcracker Prince is a Canadian Christmas movie from 1990. It is based on the story ''The Nutcracker And The Mouseking'' by E.T.A. Hoffmann.

The film is about a girl named Clara who gets a nutcracker doll from her uncle on Christmas Eve. We learn that the doll was really a Prince that was turned into a Nutcracker by the Mousequeen.

During the night, Clara begins to fall in love with the nutcracker doll, and she starts singing and dancing with the doll in her hands. Then her uncle magically appears, and makes all the dolls in the room come to life, including the Nutcracker. The rest of the film involves the Nutcracker protecting Clara and the dolls while trying to defeat the Mouseking. A bully that wants to destroy the Prince.

I really like this movie. It's a colorful movie with lots of funny scenes and several dramatic and romantic scenes as well. And the movie features Tchaikovsky's beautiful Nutcracker music. I recommend this movie to anyone.",1373155200,,965,4.732142857142857

1193972,5,B000006FY9,"Please look past the cheesy cover image on the DVD. It doesn't do this movie justice. When I was little, I had this on VHS and watched it over and over again around Christmas time. Now in my 20s, when I watch it, even though it appears to be a children's movie, I'm still really moved emotionally by it. I think part of it has to do with Tchaikovsky's music playing throughout. Also, the story is much more in depth compared to the ballet. I just saw the ballet last night and was wishing they'd add that additional bit of plot that is included in this movie, (SPOILER ALERT) where Clara wakes up and is left wondering whether her experience in the Land of the Dolls was a dream or not, and where the Nutcracker is. Phyllis Diller is hilarious as the Mousequeen and Kiefer Sutherland's voice makes the Nutcracker totally dreamy. I also love the coloring, especially that of the town and Uncle Drosselmeier's toy castle. The best part of the movie is the last 10 or 15 minutes. The climax conflict is actually pretty terrifying and emotional, especially since the Pas de deux: Intrada, my favorite piece of music from the Nutcracker, evocative and romantic and epic, is playing throughout and until the end of the movie. This version of the Nutcracker is entertaining for kids and adults both, as others have said in their reviews, not just a silly cartoon version of the famous ballet, although I wish they would have included characters from the ballet in the Land of the Dolls, like the Hot Chocolates, the Flowers, the Tea, the Coffee, the Candy Canes, etc. I'm sorry to see it's no longer available but very glad I ordered this a few years ago when I had seen it out on DVD.",1355616000,,1678,4.504918032786885

Then I thought about the long lost cartoon version and wished I could watch it again, especially with my husband.  I looked for it on Netflix, on other television channels and never found it.  Then I tried Amazon and the rest is history.  I ordered it right then and there and it was a couple of days before Christmas so I knew for sure that I was not going to get it until after the holidays.

All of the music is from the actual Tchaikovsky score and is a great introduction to music appreciation without the students even realizing it!  It's a wonderful buy for classrooms and homes.

1193981,5,B000006FY9,"Please look past the awful cover and you will find a true gem of an animated movie, with great characters and animation. Produced by now defunct Canadian studio Lacewood Productions, this adaptation of the classic ballet takes a quite different approach to the story than the ballet. This is an exciting, involving story that can be enjoyed on many levels. It's also perfect family viewing; girls will be enthralled by the love story, boys will love the Mouse King. If I am to look past target audiences, though, this film just works amazingly.

The Nutcracker Prince tells of Claire, the young girl of an upper-class rural German speaking home (in which country the story takes place is never made clear). Family friend, ""uncle"" Drosselmeier, a renowned craftsman, gives Claire a nutcracker at the family's Christmas party. He tells her the story of how a young man was cursed by the evil Mouse Queen for helping a beautiful princess, and that only by defeating her son, the Mouse King, can he become human again. The following two nights, Claire learns that there's more to this story than just fairytale.

Let me make one thing plain; Phyllis Diller's role in this movie is NOT big. The Mouse Queen only appears for about five minutes of the film. It's not fair that her name is on the cover and not the one of Mike MacDonald, the voice of the Mouse King, when he is one of the movie's biggest roles. Because let's face it, the star of this film is the Mouse King. He is vile, repugnant and ugly. Yet in a true demonstration of the power of animation, he is absolutely amazing; a nonstop powerhouse of cruel laughs and evil intentions, quite content on threatening to kill Claire's kitten if she doesn't surrender the Nutcracker to him. There are a number of scary scenes with the Mouse King, and his interaction with Claire is practically the driving force of the film. It's also funny how he contrasts his bumbling, incompetent mouse troops.

It's interesting how this film has two animation styles. One of those only features for about ten minutes, telling the tale of the Nutcracker's origin, where the whole look is very stylised, but still lively and appealing (modern tv networks would find a lot of helpful tips from this section). The other, then, is my favourite; lively and flowing, and especially relishing in the case of the Mouse King. All of his present day scenes are divine in their beauty (even though he certainly isn't). Mike MacDonald's voice performance clinches the deal; he is scary and threatening, and bursting with personality.

Of course the timeless Nutcracker music is to be found here, even adorned with lyrics in the beautiful ""If You Could Hear Me Now"". There are some strong supporting roles, such as the aged colonel and Claire's vain doll. Mostly, though, this film belongs to Claire, the Nutcracker and the Mouse King. This is a wonderful family film that can be enjoyed on many levels, visually and in terms of story, characters and moral. So basically, this is an excellent movie.",1271548800,4,3022,4.783524904214559

1194015,4,B000006FY9,"I remember watching this many years ago with my younger siblings during Christmas and have been looking for it. I'm glad it's available on DVD now so that I can share it with my preschooler. We watched it this afternoon and I was happy that the magic of the story and animation is still there, and my preschooler loved it too. This version of the Nutcracker remains more faithful to the E.T.A. Hoffmann's version of the story. Young Clara (voiced by Megan Fellows of ""Anne of Green Gables"") receives a wooden nutcracker at Christmas from toymaker Drosselmeier, who regales her with the story of how the nutcracker came to be the way he is. That very night, Clara has dreams about a fantastical battle between the Nutcracker Prince (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) and the evil Mouse King, and the outcome is one that not only affects the Nutcracker's freedom but young Clara's future as well. The accompanying music by Tchaikovsky enhances the animation and makes it all the more magical.  The themes explored include those of courage, loyalty, and sacrifice. This is a family friendly feature that will entertain both children and adults. Recommended.",1258502400,,1149,4.922680412371134

The law of supply and demand applies only to those who are too greedy to ask a fair price, and those who are too eager to part with their money, regardless of the item's perceived value or rarity.

I do not recommend this to anyone wanting to tell the story to a young child-read them a book. She loved the ballet by-the-way, once I persuaded her to go after seeing the video!",1200096000,,332,4.123076923076923

1194032,1,B000006FY9,"I purchased this DVD based on all the positive reviews, however after viewing it, I was extremely disappointed.

I watched this movie with my two-year old son and my four-year old daughter.  The movie starts out simple enough w/Clara and Fritz heading home to the party.  However, the storyline vears off from the original ballet version when Drosselmyer begins to explain to Clara how his nephew became the Nutcracker.  It takes the viewer into a mini-subplot about a king (who is rather rude) and his Queen (whom I assume is supposed to resemble Mother Ginger?).  I found this part of the storyline to be annoying and unnecessary.  My daughter (who has seen the ballet version of the Nutcracker) kept looking at me confused wondering who these characters were (since they are not part of the ballet version).

Then my two-year old basically jumped into my lap when the Queen Rat's son (very ugly and mean looking) came back to life after it appeared to be dead.  I am fully aware of the battle between the mice and the soldiers and expected a certain amount of violence.  However, when the camera zooms in closely on what appears to be a dead rat and then the rat jumps up and roars w/it's ugly face, I don't find that appropriate for small children.  Talk about causing nightmares!

My daughter was also very disappointed that there was no Land of Sweets (this movie has Land of Dolls) and that the ""best part"" was missing (performances by foreign countries -- China, Arabia, Russia, etc.).

This movie was a huge disappointment!!!!  Not recommended if you're looking for the ballet storyline.",1166659200,10,1596,4.781021897810219
1194033,5,B000006FY9,I had been looking for this movie for years. I used to watch this every year on HBO and couldn't remember the name of it. When I searched for the nutcracker I thought I would never find it but here it is. This is a great version of the nutcracker. I would recommend it as a family holiday tradition movie.,1165363200,,305,4.1
1194034,5,B000006FY9,"A film which has surpassed the test of time is the only way I can describe 'The Nutcracker Prince.' A true Christmas classic with stunning animation, a wonderful story and beautiful music and songs. It's also appealing to both genders and people of many ages. It features action for the boys and romance for the girls with everything else in between. The tale of how the Nutcracker 'came to look the way he does' is filled with humour but like the whole film leaves you with a feeling of compassion for the poor nutcracker and as it turns out poor Clara. The film has a perfect balance of both sentimental moments of sadness matched with moments of absolute joy and an ending that will please all.

Moments to watch out for include:

Clara's dance and song with the Nutcracker (my favourite scene in the film), the scene where Marie (the typical teen doll) struts her stuff and sends a mouse catapulting through the air, Marie's entrance into The Land Of The Dolls, Clara and the Nutcracker's ballet dance in The Land Of The Dolls and Clara's final emotional battle against the Mouse King (that's right the girl even gets to fight on her own behalf for once).

Overall the film has many wonderful morals for children of all ages. From lessons of courage and self-sacrifice to accepting ones self and accepting the changes that come with growing up, 'The Nutcracker Prince' is a masterpiece that deserves to be nurtured and appreciated; watched time and time again.",1164585600,,1464,4.7109375
1194035,5,B000006FY9,"I found this movie, the VHS version, when I was in high school...and I still love to watch it every Christmas! It is such a sweet movie, and I love the music. I never knew the words to ""The Nutcracker Suite"", until this movie.

This movie is entertaining for ALL ages, and it will fast become a wonderful Christmas tradition once you see it. I'm SO glad that they finally have it out on DVD!! Can't wait to get mine!",1161302400,,416,4.2
1194036,4,B000006FY9,"My kids enjoyed this movie - a cartoon.

I enjoyed the music - especially the Theme from the Nutcracker Prince, ""Always Come Back To You.""

Does ANYONE know where I can find the soundrack, or just that song?

1194037,5,B000006FY9,"After wearing out my old video every Christmas in the 90's, this one took a while to show up on DVD. It was first out in Europe in 2002, so being able to play multi region DVD's, I quickly snatched it up.  It was rather low budget, but finally, in 2004, a slightly better quality US version came out!

The incredible music, the vibrant colors, the excellent voice-overs, and of course, the story.  A young girl is told by her Grandfather the tale about the wooden nutcracker he gave her as a gift.  A boy soldier was turned into wood by the evil Mousequeen, and to become a real boy again, he must defeat the Mouseking.

With the voices of Phyllis Diller, Kiefer Sutherland, Peter O'Toole, and Megan Follows, you just can't go wrong with this cast.  An excellent treat, meant to be watched every year!",1131494400,26,801,4.4520547945205475

1194051,5,B000006FY9,"I've read some other reviews on the internet, and they said this movie was horrible, but I've never failed to watch it at least twice every Christmas season for every year I've been alive. The most blows are to the animation, but I don't think it's that bad, and come on, it's only 1990. But I fell in love with it the very first time I saw it. I've read the books, seen the ballets, own the soundtrack, and have Nutcrackers of my own. This is a wonderful movie for children and adult alike. It is close to the book, which I think is wonderful. It also has smatterings of humour, which is a nice touch. Drosselmeier was done fabulously, as were all the other characters. A must see for the holidays.",1070841600,6,699,4.303030303030303
1194052,5,B000006FY9,"Forget what those snobby critics say, this movie is awesome. I saw it years ago on the Disney Channel and loved it, now my family watch it every Christams. I always loved the story of Clara and the Nutcracker but could never get into ballet. Sure ballet is nice to watch for the first several minutes to everything starts looking like it's repeated over and over. This movie has the plot with the Prince turning into the Nutcracker, the battle scene with the Mice and toys and the confrontation with the Nutcracker and the Mouse King (who I think is the best animated character, and Clara's journey into Toy land without all the endless jumping up and down. There is one scene where the Prince and Clara dance in the land of the dolla which is well done with the music too. The ending is great and it should be played every year! I love it so much I wrote a ""sequel"" which is posted on fanfiction and the director of the movie is going to read it!

So all in all, this movie of the story is the best way also to introduce others to the story of the girl and her nutcracker prince. (:",1070236800,11,1083,4.257281553398058

It had groly, adventure, laughs, and romance. It Was Like
The Movie The Pirates of Penzance with Kevin Kline and
Angela Lansbury It like same verture of The Nutcracker Prince.
And Also like the Franklin the Turtle Adventure. You Know I
hope someday there do the same movie and turn into Franklin's
Big Adventure: Franklin and the Nutcracker Princess That will
fall in love to the girl of his dream like another turtle.

1194055,5,B000006FY9,"When I was eleven, I remember watching this version of ""The Nutcracker"" when it first came out on video, and I fell completely in love with it. I agree with the other reviewers about the not so top notch animation ; however the story line was intriguing. It is a bit different when comparing it to Tchaikovsky's ballet. This portrayal of the Christmas classic comes close to E.T.A. Hoffman's book ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King."" (If you love the ""Nutcracker"" you should go read it.  The best translation is by  Ralph Manheim  and illustrator by Maurice Sendak. Go check it out!)  You have the leading character, Clara (Megan Fellows ""Anne of Green Gables""), an adolescent girl who wants to hold on to her childhood.  Nutcracker (Keiffer Sutherland), a young prince of the toys, who is cursed to live his life as a nutcracker.  Uncle Drosselmier (I have no idea who play's this character) who is the instigator of Clara's and Nutcrackers meeting.  Also, a handful of colorful supporting characters (the mouse queen played by  Phylis Diller) that makes the story a delight to watch.  Through out the story they have dance scenes and used Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker"" music as background music.  What I mostly enjoyed in the movie is Clara's struggle to figure out what her true dreams are and whether to live in a fantasy world or face adulthood.  The ending also leaves us questioning if Clara's adventures with her Nutcracker Prince was a dream or reality. Older children (as well as adults) will enjoy this movie.  What I mean by older children (8 yrs and up)  is that there is a bit of fighting and death scenes.  Other than that,  it's a great movie to watch during the holidays!",1041379200,,1685,4.742268041237113
