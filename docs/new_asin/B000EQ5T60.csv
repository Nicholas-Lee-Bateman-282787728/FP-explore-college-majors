8112729,4,B000EQ5T60,"Teenage hormones are at peak level in this nice little German film 'Sommersturm' or 'Summer Storm' and the result is a set of mini-crises that tumble young people all the time: first sexual attraction, the ambiguity of close friendships, the trials and lessons of first sexual encounters, and the manner in which teenagers survive their sexual decisions amongst their peers.

Director Marco Kreuzpaintner and writer (with Thomas Bahmann) set this attractive coming of age film on the playing field of crewing, a sport that demands full attention and intense cooperation from every team mate. Two teams from Bavaria, one of boys and the other of girls, take off for a summer camp training session where they encounter another crew from Berlin, a crew that just happens to be composed of gay young boys. The Bavarian boys' crew team is lead by two long-term friends - Tobi (Robert Stadlober) and Achim (Kostja Ullmann) - and while their friendship is strong, Tobi is discovering that his feelings for Achim go far deeper. The two share stories about their girlfriends - Anke (and beautiful Alicja Bachleda-Curus) and Sandra (Miriam Morgenstern) who head the girl's crew team. At the summer camp Tobi's feelings for Achim deepen and the influence of the team of very handsome young gay boys on the opposing team only serve to heighten the tension. Tobi eventually has an encounter with a particularly tender and understanding Leo (Marlon Kittel) and as the questions begin to arise a violent storm makes the entire group flee for cover. The manner in which Tobi comes out to his team and to Achim is the very tender dnouement of the story. The storm raging in Tobi (as well as in other members of the team) settles into the aftermath.

Some viewers may find this film too explicit for general viewing but for this viewer the encounters all around remain tasteful and touching. The director seems to be telling us that the 'first experience', whether that is gay or straight, is or can be traumatic as well as fulfilling. The cast does well: there are many very beautiful young boys and girls who play their roles with a natural simplicity and allure. For a young director (only 29 years old and this is his fifth film) Kreutzpainter seems to have a solid future. Grady Harp, January 07",1168905600,,2282,4.833759590792839
8112730,5,B000EQ5T60,A feeling in tact that well all know what it can be like to like/love someone and to move forward. The character Tobi had to find himself and learn to be strong. I would love to have the album of the music. It's great,1165363200,,217,3.9545454545454546
8112731,4,B000EQ5T60,"This film is now available as a DVD.  See separate listing.  This film was significant in Germany because Robert Stadlober is a popular young actor and band member there whose coming out in the character of Tobi was unsettling. Certainly Kostja Ullmann as Achim, his buddy and secret love, is cute enough to win many hearts. And his pretend love interest, Alicja Bachleda-Curus as Anke, is sweet and beautiful enough to convince nearly anyone that being gay is NOT a lifestyle choice. When another rowing team bold enough to call themselves the QueerStrokes (which actually exists) shows up, Tobi gets to see the spectrum of gay characters, from manly Malte to effeminate Nils; and Marlon Kittel as Leo sure takes in an eyeful of Tobi as he bides his time. Seeking refuge from a raging storm (and from an increasingly stormy relationship with Achim) in a closed hostel building brings some closer together, and drives others apart. There isn't much new for American audiences in that there have been a number of equally well done coming out films here, but Summer Storm rings true because it is at least partly autobiographical for director and writer Marco Kreuzpaintner, and Stadtlober and Ullmann certainly have chemistry together to spare as mates. In fact the whole crew seemed to be having a really good time. The film ends with Tobi arriving home from the summer rowing camp a changed boy. Stepping off the bus and facing his front door his stern look changes to a faint smile. A small touch, but a reason Robert Stadtlober has won awards, and why the film will win aclaim.",1157932800,3,1580,4.805147058823529
8112732,5,B000EQ5T60,"I had the pleasure of Seeing ""Sommersturm"" in Germany in german 2 years ago. This movie is without a doubt, hands down the best gay coming of age film I have ever seen. Think back to ""The summer when everything changed"" when you were 16 or 17 and this movie will hold a special place in your heart as it does mine.",1145404800,13,314,4.080645161290323
8112733,4,B000EQ5T60,"At first I was a little hesitant about seeing another movie about young gays. It seems there is so much focus on youth and beauty. But since this is a coming out story, it works. The lead seems completely believable and charming despite a couple of unkind actions he makes as he lashes out in pain and confusion. The gay rowing team is fun to watch, and it is nice to see that the coach of the protagonist's team is not homophobic when he meets the gay team. Despite the pain of the main character, there is a lot of humor, and while this film may not be a classic, it is one I can see more than once. It is basically a feel-good film and was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.",1144454400,13,685,4.044117647058823
