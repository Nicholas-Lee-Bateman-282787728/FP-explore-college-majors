6246238,5,B00I0E4L08,"I purchased all the exact same DVDs individually for $118 verses the $143 dollar price tag for the set.  In addition, there were complaints about earlier DVD releases not using the original music but that is not the case with the currently sold DVDs/versions.  This was a great series and well worth the money.",1394841600,14,310,4.722222222222222

6246240,5,B00I0E4L08,"This was a favorite show from the 90s for both my husband and myself. It is so much fun to watch the shows again. The DVDs work beautifully, no occasional skipping, as sometimes occurs with a DVD. The items shipped quickly and were exactly what I ordered.",1522195200,,255,4.446808510638298

6246243,4,B00I0E4L08,"Have  not watched all episodes, yet, but so far it is great.  Had a small problem with one disc/episode with poor audio and video, but in all, very satisfied.",1517443200,,158,4.413793103448276

6246245,3,B00I0E4L08,This was a surprise Christmas gift for my husband. He really liked the series and would always complain that they never show reruns. He was so surprised with the gift and said it was one of the best gifts he had ever received. He only watches  a few each day to make them last long instead of a Northern Exposure marathon. Now he's thinking about  getting other series of programs he really liked. The disks were in new sealed boxes and well worth the money.,1515456000,,458,4.376470588235295

6246250,5,B00I0E4L08,One of the very best tv serials ever produced. It ties in love of the wilderness with an array of developed characters. Almost felt like family to me. I always learned something about the wild of Alaska and eventually went there where I did see the wildlife and met some really good people. This tv series did more to promote the state of Alaska and it's beauty than anything else I have ever seen. The diversity of problems the cast faced on a weekly basis was always entertaining. I think you will love this 6 season series.,1487894400,10,526,4.43298969072165
6246251,5,B00I0E4L08,"A lot of people put this set down for not having the original music. All I can say is buy it, you'll love it. I enjoy all of it. This is a great set and the picture quality is great.",1419724800,2,182,3.575
6246252,4,B00I0E4L08,The only reasons I didn't give this collection a 5 star rating is there is very little if no color in them! Every disc and scene has a greenish tint to them. Other wise sound is great.,1412035200,2,184,4.0
6246253,4,B00I0E4L08,"I bought this complete series because an Amazon reviewer here said this set had the original music. This is not true. In cases where the music plays a direct part in the story (usually at the end of an episode), yes, the correct music is here. But in most cases, it's replaced by canned stock music. Paramount has missed a bet never releasing the original series intact. If it meant paying more, I, like all other hardcore NorX fans, would gladly pony up. So, I'm disappointed in that Amazon review that incorrectly stated the right music isn't here. But, it's nice to finally have the whole series. Get your act together, Paramount.",1409961600,41,633,4.660714285714286

6246255,5,B00I0E4L08,"This show was our favorite when it was being broadcast.  Great characters, great scripts, great acting and great direction.  After years of hoping that it would be available for streaming we bit the bullet and bought the DVDs.  we are enjoying them",1408579200,,248,4.857142857142857
6246256,5,B00I0E4L08,"If you loved watching Northern Exposure when it was a TV series, then you'll love having the whole set.",1407715200,,103,4.473684210526316
6246257,5,B00I0E4L08,"LOVE THE SHOW BEYOND REASON!
At the time of the show, I had finished my Neurology training in Boston but decided to spend some time in a somewhat rural part of North Carolina for a few years.  Having been back practicing in Boston for over 10 years, my stories of living and practicing in NC prompted my family to buy me the dvd set of N. Exposure and watch it with me.  During its first TV run, I had only watched a few episodes.
My impressions?  Fabulous writing, acting, directing, producing...you name it...but then again, for me, the show cut quite close to my working/living reality as a doc while in NC.

If the show was ever rebroadcasted in syndication, I suspect a  tremendous growing fan base would be resurrected.

I haven't viewed all the dvds, so I can't comment on the overall technical quality, but so far very  good.
For the content of the shows, that's a matter of personal taste that should be left up to the viewer:
I'm a fan, but that's a personal taste.",1405641600,5,975,4.443820224719101
6246258,5,B00I0E4L08,"This show is timeless.  I love it.  Very entertaining!  I went to Alaska after watching this show in the 90's, and didn't quite find the same quirkiness I expected, but what an enjoyable trip.",1400457600,,192,4.588235294117647

8638003,4,B00I0E4L08,"Still watching the series.  I'm not too happy with the first season as the last episode of the second disk skips, freezes, stops, or jumps ahead. The second season seems to be ok so far. I need to watch the rest of the series to determine if I need to have some of the episodes replaced. I love the series otherwise.",1531180800,,316,4.180327868852459
