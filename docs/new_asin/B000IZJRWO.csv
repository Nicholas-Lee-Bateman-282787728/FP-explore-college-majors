It shipped on time and came in decent packaging.  Great buy.",1432252800,,257,4.543478260869565

8148111,5,B000IZJRWO,"Great movie and DVD. Beautiful songs, enchanting scenery and haunting ambiance. Good movies from Bollywood in the mystery genre are rare. Sadhana, Manoj Kumar, K.N. Singh and Prem Chopra turn in in good performances.",1331769600,,216,5.382352941176471
8148112,4,B000IZJRWO,"The story is just very very good and Raj Khosla was an able director of his time who directed classic suspense movies like Mera Saaya and Anita too. He has handled the plot very well. The problem is with the revelation of the suspense in the climax in which the police officer, Raj Mehra delivers a long speech regarding the mystery and despite that leaves many significant questions unanswered. If you ignore that fact, you won't find any fault with the movie which contains comedy, romance and melodious music alongwith the gripping mystery. The very first scene grips you like a powerful clamp and then you are so engrossed in the narrative that you can leave the movie after seeing its climax only, not before that. Woh Kaun Thi (who was she ?) is a black and white movie released in 1964 starring Manoj Kumar and Saadhana. It is still considered a classic mystery. In fact the fact of its being black and white is a plus point of this movie as the mystery appears to be deeper with the characters appearing on the screen looking more mysterious than they actually are. The great music composed by Madan Mohan rendered further strength to the suspense and thrill of the movie and Saadhana in the title role delivered a splendid performance to make the movie as spellbinding for the viewers. Technically also the movie is perfect. The aura of suspense is maintained throughout. The cinematographer has ably captured the snowy beauty of Shimla.",1302480000,,1446,4.742063492063492
