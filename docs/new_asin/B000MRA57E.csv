8171105,5,B000MRA57E,"Gives you an insight to how hip hop has influenced the world. In this specific title, it focuses on the growth, hardships, and artists struggle in hip hop from kenya.",1435968000,,166,4.566666666666666
8171106,2,B000MRA57E,"This documentary is a pioneer in showing the origins of hip-hop culture in Kenya.
I can't give you the spoiler since its like the trailer shows everything you expect.
However, the artistes are really young which begs the question si wafanye a follow up documentary ndio tuone vile industry imeendelea from them instead of reports from our media houses and also don't rush it next time.
Generally,it is a good one (I would recommend to wannabe artistes) but leaves a lot to be desired.

8171107,2,B000MRA57E,Could have been much better.  Expected more from this documentary.  Seemed like it was rushed to production and did not appropriately cover social commentary.,1386374400,,158,5.541666666666667
8171108,5,B000MRA57E,"I did, until I watched this video, set in Nairobi.  New and eye-opening to me was the potential of this genre of music to adapt to any culture, any language, and provide a way for impoverished young people to express the unique frustrations of their lives.  And you cannot help but be impressed by the leaps forward in use of language by these hip hop artists.  Now I hear these sometimes subtle influences everywhere in our own popular music and I think it's very impressive, actually. Highly recommended.",1359504000,,506,4.7272727272727275
8171109,5,B000MRA57E,"My Husband had been on [...] viewing various things he wanted for Father's Day. He e-mailed me a subtle hint that he was interested in this. So, I surprised him with it! I'm Glad I did! Not only did He enjoy it, but all of his family was over and they thoroughly enjoyed it as well. I would definitely consider purchasing DVD's in this category, Roots of Rap & Hip-Hop etc.

Jina langu ni ""E""arl aka Otieno The Luo Man kutoka South Bronx New York. Sasa ninakaa katika Pasadena California. Nilijifunza Kiswahili mwaka iliyopita na sasa najaribu kupata kila mtu weusi katika America kujifunza lugha hii. Nilinunua Hip-Hop Colony wiki iliyopita na ilikuwa nzuri sana!! In New York slang...it's OFF THE HOOK...STRAIGHT BANGIN'... HOT TO DEATH!!! I am so happy to hear the mixture of Swahili and Hip-Hop. The freestyles and flows are unbelievable! I want to convince African-American hip-hop artists to learn Swahili and use it in their flows. My website above now encouraging its visitors to buy this CD and I will show this to all of the young teenagers I work with in schools and as a counselor. Please continue to flow and expand.....amani.",1183075200,,777,5.0703125
8171111,4,B000MRA57E,"If you love Kenyan music you'll love this movie it is very entertaining especially the freestyle sessions K-shaka, bamboo and nannoma stole the show.",1179100800,,149,5.25
8171112,5,B000MRA57E,"This is a step in showing how hip hop is evolving around the world especially in Africa. This shows you a different side of Africa from the eyes of the people, as you go through this hip-hop journey. It would be put in the category of documentaries that introduced hip-hop to mainstream America. This, too introduces us to the hip-hop revolution that has started in Africa.",1178668800,2,373,4.666666666666667
8171113,5,B000MRA57E,"Wow there has never been a film I have purchased that is as dear to me as this one. There are so many reasons why one should get hold of it.

1. The Film itself is of very high standards...Strong script and production, very informative and most of all entertaining.

2. If u r a hip hop fanatic, general music fun, then this will inspire u regardless of what type of music u r into. The life of a musician is somewhat the same globally.

3. If u r of African decent, in particular Kenyan then u should be so proud. First beacuse it shows that we are capable of producing good films...secondly because of the content of the film.

Buy it for yourself, friends and any one in the entertainment industry....invest in your country it's your heritage.",1176249600,4,746,4.384057971014493
