8547047,5,B00A6QPX9Q,"While the story was somewhat predictable, Ma bonne etoile was a film that tugs at your heartstrings. Fleur Lise Heuet did an excellent job portraying Louise a young girl whose love of horses (particularly Marquise) may be the way out of her family's financial crisis. Christophe Lambert portrays Louise's father with such love and conviction. I am truly happy he starred in this film that will allow others to see beyond the action figuires he portrayed in the past. The scenery is breathtaking as is the story itself.",1358726400,,518,4.8977272727272725
