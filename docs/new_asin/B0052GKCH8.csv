8453925,2,B0052GKCH8,"Starts with Lulu not dressed as a shepherdess as intended, but in the buff, briar patch and all - and ends with The Ripper as Santa Claus and Lulu, stabbed yet just standing there seemingly trying to decide whether or not to drop dead.  Inbetween so much stage alteration motion that you never knew what belongs in the opera & what doesn't.  And the Barcelona orchestra is no match for Jimmy Levine's ensemble.  OK, many of you like regietheater and here it is for you.  Me, I don't.

There is a new Met performance that may be available on dvd by now & it's very good also.  Again, a bit phantasmagorical but still within the bounds of good taste and credibility.",1497398400,,664,4.446280991735537

8453927,4,B0052GKCH8,"Hard to rate.  I love Wozzeck, but Lulu is not an easy opera to like. It's not just that the music is far from tuneful (12 tone in part as I recall), but it's hard to have sympathy with any of the characters. You can't really like Lulu or even feel sorry for her, and the others are mostly equally unlikeable. I was fascinated during the 1st act, a bit distracted in the 2nd, and frankly not all that attentive in the 3rd. Indeed I later watched the last act all by itself just to finish off the experience faithfully.

The sets are garish, really over the top and the costumes fit right in. But actually that's one of the things I most liked about this performance. It is visually riveting, and I often wished I could see the whole set during more focused shots. There's a lot going on all the time, and it's a close call as to whether all the activity in the background or the main characters (mostly Lulu) should be the focus. Probably the person who filmed it did a reasonable job -- just once in a while I wanted to see what wasn't being featured.  Lots of allusions to god knows what. The opera was written (only Acts I and II) in the late 1930s and generally although the time frame is somewhat jumbled mostly it seems to take place in late 1920s and 1930s all over Europe. This was not Europe's finest hour, and the performance  captures quite well the vulgarity of the opera and the times. For those who care, there is some simulated nudity and an out of focus porno movie in the background at one point.

The other feature that makes this performance outstanding is Patricia Petibon. She is a Lulu for the ages. She's pretty enough to be convincing as a person who basically used her body to get ahead, and the vocal (and bodily) acting is extraordinary. I'm not in position to comment on her vocal accuracy, but then who cares? She's on stage most of the time, and she's always fascinating. Really one of the most interesting and fascinating portrayals in opera.

As I said a hard opera to rate, and frankly to like, hence 4 stars. I bought the DVD because none of the libraries available to me had it. I had seen the first 2 acts many years ago before the opera was finished by others, and wasn't sure whether I liked it or not. Recordings can't possibly do it justice and the two I own don't. Not sorry I bought it, but I'm not likely to watch it again soon. That said, it's hard to imagine a better performance, and for those who love the opera more than I do a visual and vocal treat. .",1409788800,,2501,4.288135593220339
8453928,5,B0052GKCH8,"Inverted symmetry is of course counterintuitive, but the sets divide color and form, or space time appropriately.  The precision in Petibon's voice had to be such because otherwise, the symmetry would not be heard.  Didn't she have a musicology degee cum laude...impressive...",1407974400,,276,5.5476190476190474
8453929,5,B0052GKCH8,"... or any great work of German Expressionism explicitly, is a ""mug's game"" and yet that's exactly what an opera stage director must do in order to make a performance compelling. Director Olivier Py has given LULU a raspy ultra-feminist interpretation; his Lulu is ""more sinned against than sinning"" even when she is most destructive of the lives of those who are drawn to her. I'll let you jangle that interpretation over any others you may have encountered, either in productions of Alban Berg's unfinished masterpiece or in the plays by Frank Wedekind upon which it was based.

Stage&Costume Director Pierre-Andre Weitz surely worked closely with Py, but his interpretation is less easily categorized. This is a LULU set among lurid sex-shop lights, the circus as Max Beckmann or Georg Grosz imagined it, corruption and decadence, sleaze and glitz. If you can still be shocked by anything you see on an opera stage, get your smelling salts in hand before you watch this DVD.

I've seen LULU live in four different venues, many years apart, and I've watched all the currently available filmings of it. That's odd, I have to say, because I consider it an extremely flawed work as a theater script, and I have yet to encounter an interpretation that renders Berg's or Wedekind's view of Life palatable. Py's version has the virtues of being vivid and coherent.

It's the music, of course, that moves me, and nothing could be less explicit than great music. Not all the music you will hear on this recording is strictly speaking by Alban Berg. The composer had finished only the first two acts at the time of his death in 1935. Others have expanded his ""sketches"" of Act Three, so that nearly every production or recording sounds radically different after the curtain of Act Two. This production was conducted by Nichael Broder, but I strongly suspect that Olivier Py made all the significant decisions about what to cut or keep ... and he kept everything. The orchestration of the Third Act is not of the quality of Berg's own incisive composition, and to my eyes&ears the Third Act gets bogged down and drags.

But that's a minor flaw in light of the superlative performance of Patricia Petibon as Lulu, both musically and dramatically. Petibon is a Lulu for all time. She's physically perfect for the role. She uses her eyes, her lips, her face, her whole body to make Lulu the feral temptress she needs to be. Petibon works hard in this staging and puts up with a lot of extra-musical demands in explicitly obscene undress and behavior. The role is over-demanding enough vocally, a crashing current of abstract coloratura. Petibon sings it edgily, harshly, at times painfully ... perfectly in short. If any major company casts a different singer in this role in the next decade, it needs to replace its impresario.

Wedekind's 'Lulu' plays were banned in the 1890s, Needless to guess, LULU and all of Berg's music, along with that of Schoenberg and Zemlinsky, was branded ""Entartete Musik"" - Decadent Music - by the German ultra-nationalists led by one Adolf Hitler. How ironic it is, that the mostly highly esteemed German art - painting and music - of the 1920s and 1930s was Expressionism, whether by Jewish or unJewish artists! And what opera of the 20th Century seems more vividly to characterize German culture and society than LULU?",1359763200,4,3342,4.856140350877193
8453930,3,B0052GKCH8,"The sets were too convoluted and although the plot seemed very interesting the translation or subtitles made little to know sence the translation seemed a little confusing,",1357862400,,172,5.407407407407407
8453931,4,B0052GKCH8,But I prefer Christine for the role.  patricia is quite good and somehow hot.  LOL.  Her Lulu is quite good,1357257600,,107,4.25
8453932,5,B0052GKCH8,"Lulu was one of the first operas that I connected with on a permanent basis along with, oddly, Wagner's Siegfried and Britten's The Turn of the Screw.  Perhaps it takes a twisted personality to love Berg's final masterpiece, happily complete here in the posthumous 3 act version with orchestrations by Friedrich Cerha.  I grew to know and love this opera from the old DG set conducted by Karl Bhm and starring Evelyn Lear as Lulu in a fine performance from Berlin.  I loved the Bhm so much I bought my first duplicate of any opera on record in my early collection, the Dohnanyi 2 act version with Anja Silja.  I wore those sets of  lps out long ago and switched to the historical first performance of the complete 3 act version from Paris conducted by Pierre Boulez and starring Teresa Stratas.  Then I got my hands on two filmed versions, an early live performance from Silja in 1969 and, later from 1980, a grainy video with Levine conducting a so-so production with Julia Migenes.

The Silja and Migenes Lulus preserve, in rough and ready video, two famous performers in this tremendously difficult part.  There are other filmed versions I haven't seen, notably Christine Schfer's from Glyndebourne, but all in all very few commercially recorded or filmed Lulus.  There aren't many sopranos around who can sing this part.  Patricia Petibon sweeps the boards, in my experience with this score.  She is an astonishing Lulu.  Her singing and acting are masterful and seemingly effortless.  Watching her performance brought several other actresses to mind, Garbo, Deneuve and Monroe more often than not.  Petibon has a chameleon quality to her.

Her costumes, when she's wearing more than just that spectacular set of false eyelashes!, are stunning and she moves like the temptress of one's wildest imagination.  And Berg composed one of the most seductive and provocative leitmotivs for her that rivals anything Wagner concocted for Isolde or Kundry in their Female Eld power.

Petibon's Lulu is no innocent victim of man's cruelty to women, she's a predator herself, perhaps made that way by men or not.  Mostly what became clear to me about this production, especially Petibon's performance and Py's direction, is that Lulu is about everything vicious and mercenary about mankind.  It looks at humanity through an obsidian crystal, not simply a glass darkly.

Petibon's is a cosmic performance captured on film in a fascinating production designed by Pierre-Andr Weitz and directed by Olivier Py.  The brilliant, often lurid lighting is designed by Bertrand Killy and plays a major role in the show.  And this is not just an opera, it is theater at its most magnetic and thought-provoking.  I didn't read any of the blurbs in the booklet about the director's Konzept or anything, and I expect there IS an essay on it somewhere, but chose to just watch the show and see how it hit me.
At first the nudity and all the eye-catching action at the back of the stage seemed a little unnecessary, then I started getting in to it and I quickly accepted all the stage action.  I hardly noticed the stage hands moving the props about during scene changes with the performers taking part in the general decampment.  The whole thing is very balletic.

The entire cast is a fine one though it is a shame that Paul Groves finely sung and acted Alwa does not quite pull off the over-heated stud routine at the end of Act 2.  But we can't have everything, especially in this opera.  Aside from Patricia Petibon's Lulu, Ashley Holland's Dr Schn and Jack the Ripper, dressed like Santa Claus, Julia Juon's disturbing and pathetic Countess Geshwitz and Will Hartman's Painter deserve special mention.  Not to forget Franz Grundheber's wonderful and comically horrifying Schigolch, Lulu's papa.

After Petibon's, however, my favorite performance came from the young bass Andreas Hrl as the Animal Trainer and Rodrigo the athlete.  Not only does he possess a booming, ringing, beautiful bass voice he is a facile and vivid actor, a natural comedian.  Hrl is only 39 and has a brilliant career ahead of him in Wagner and other heavy basso roles in Verdi.

Michael Boder conducts a very tight ship with plenty of expression and sensitivity to the quickly changing colors of this beautiful score.  The camera direction by Franois Roussillon is natural and imaginative.  The viewer is always at the most interesting vantage at all times.  The orchestra plays flawlessly.

There is an x-rated filmed montage in Act 3 that, though blurry and at a distance, is probably not recommended for children, or shy adults.

The nudity is not much really.  Petibon is such a spectacular singer and actress that I quickly forgot to notice her nakedness.  What a courageous performer she is!  There is really no full frontal nudity or anything lascivious or gratuitous.  What eroticism is there is apposite to the story.  I don't like Konzept productions more often than not but this show is a brilliant evocation of a very difficult score to comprehend and actually enjoy.

And the subtitles are excellent and emphasize the more slapstick moments.  Lulu has some funny business in it along with all the blood and deception.  Verdi would have probably loved Lulu.

Bravo to all concerned in this DG film!",1330214400,21,5267,4.906108597285068
8453933,5,B0052GKCH8,"Berg managed to complete only the first two acts of Lulu before his death in 1935. The final act in short score was orchestrated by Friedrich Cerha and first presented in 1979. That is the version performed here. Berg's music, although serial, retains the vestiges of tonality in its brilliant use of emotional resonance: there is never a hint of aridity in this exemplary score. The character of Lulu has the complexity and moral ambiguity that makes her endlessly fascinating. She is not merely a seductress. She is a force of nature: primal and disturbing but never evil. Although she destroys the men she attracts like moths to a forest fire, she herself is consumed and manages to retain our sympathy. Like Flaubert's Madame Bovary, we recognize (maybe even applaud) Lulu's rebellion against life's endless sterility. The film Pandora's Box, starring a beautiful Louis Brooks as Lulu, has a comparable acceptance of her destructive flight to freedom.

This production stars Patricia Petibon as the anti-heroine who inspires lust, longing, and ultimately pity and wonder. The role is nearly super-human in its singing and acting requirements. The star is brilliant, carrying the entire opera on her shoulders, embodying all of Lulu's complex humanity. Petibon is often required to perform nude, clothed only in a transparent body stocking, yet she always manages to convey a dignified insouciance that must be seen to be appreciated. Her singing is absolutely magnificent in what is one of the most fiendishly difficult roles in the repertory. Simultaneously conveying sexiness and gravitas, Petibon delivers a stunningly nuanced performance that brings Lulu to life as a three dimensional, living and breathing character of haunting poignancy and pity. The rest of the cast are equally gifted. There are no weak links.

The orchestral performance is sturdy and forceful under conductor Michael Boder. The staging is garish, vulgar and loud with an adult theater rawness that may be offensive to some. However, it matches its material and always seems right. I have a few minor quibbles about an occasional pretentious artiness (the ubiquitous neon signs with their mannered pithy expressions, the many tableau at the rear of the stage that I often found distracting if not pointless) but these are unimportant. This is an exemplary performance of a brilliant and important opera. The DTS 5.1 and LPCM 2.0 sound are both clear and distinct though occasionally a bit diffuse. There are the usual menus. If you are prepared to witness opera for (literally) adults only then this DVD is worth considering for your collection.

8453934,5,B0052GKCH8,"Alban Berg (1885-1934) may be the most notorious member of the Second Viennese School, even more so than leader Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) and Anton Webern (1883-1945).  Berg, the most romantic of the school, was as influenced by Gustav Mahler as Schoenberg.  Berg died young and did not live long enough to compose a large a body of work.  However, he did compose what may very well be the two most repulsive operas ever written.  Even Schoenberg was aghast, and urged his younger colleague to discontinue writing such filth.  A premature death stopped Berg from finishing his final opera, ""Lulu.""  He completed two of the three acts and the final act was completed in the short particell format.  Some forty years later, Friedrich Cerha completed the orchestration for the third act, which premiered under the direction of Pierre Boulez.  Both ""Wozzeck"" and ""Lulu"" are extreme operas from an extreme composer.  One would think that this fact would make  opera fans receptive to interpretive stagings.

Olivier Py belongs to that school of enfant terrible stage directors working in European opera today.  Py, while creating mixed reactions in Europe, is among the most in-demand and successful stage directors.  Singers clamor to work for him, his productions usually sell out within a matter of hours, and are almost always considered newsworthy events.  The European climate for opera stems from a different mindset altogether.  Most telling was a recent newscast covering the expressionist nightmare ""Magic Flute"" staged by Martin Kusej.  This ""Flute"" received wildly mixed reactions. The audience was torn between passionate applause and equally passionate catcalls.  The newscaster shrugged: ""It would not be an event if opera goers were not challenged.""

In the States, opera is seen, by and large, as an art form that has gone the way of the dinosaur.  American opera houses desperately beg for contributions and wait for the annual staging of ""La Boheme"" to (hopefully) pull them out of the red. It has been nearly a half century since an American staged opera was living art and a newsworthy event.  In the early 1970s even Leonard Bernstein's ""Mass"" was deemed sacrilegious and quickly shut down.  Contemporary America, spoon fed on banality, considers the antics of reality TV ""stars"" of higher interest.

Berg's ""take your dissonance and adult themes like a man"" Lulu is not for sissies or the artistically challenged.  Berg wrote the libretto himself from Frank Wedekind's play, ""Pandora's Box"" (the same work on which G.W. Pabst's 1929 film is based).  The opera opens in a carnivalesque milieu, and among the ringmaster's menagerie is the German pierrot Lulu. Her patron, a Dr. Schon, has hired the Painter to create a portrait of Lulu.  After Dr. Schon and his musician son, Alwa, leave the studio, the Painter makes passes at Lulu until they are interrupted by her husband. Upon stumbling onto the sight, he succumbs to a fatal heart attack.  Lulu realizes she is now a rich widow and marries the Painter.

The Painter becomes very successful, but unbeknownst to him, Lulu is receiving letters from her numerous lovers, one of which is the Countess Geschwitz.  The tramp Schigolch visits Lulu.  He is her father and long time lover, having first molested Lulu when she was a child.  News comes that Dr. Schon is now engaged, and Lulu is upset.  When Dr. Schon arrives at the studio he informs the Painter of Lulu's many adulteries.  Schon also reveals that he has been having his way with Lulu since she was a mere twelve years old.  Devastated, the Painter slashes his own throat.

Widowed again, Lulu informs Alwa that an African prince wishes to marry her.  Alwa, (possibly representing Berg himself) contemplates writing an opera about Lulu.  Dr. Schon realizing that he loves Lulu, breaks off his engagement and marries Lulu instead.

In the second act, Schon becomes increasingly jealous over Lulu's many affairs, including her relationship with the lesbian Countess.  Alwa announces that he too is in love with Lulu.  A schoolboy is another of Lulu's lovers; he hides in Lulu's apartment when Schon confronts his wife.  An argument breaks out, and the schoolboy shoots and kills Schon.

In a silent film interlude, Lulu is tried and convicted, catches cholera in prison, and is transferred to  hospital where she escapes with the help of the Countess, Schigolch, Alwa, and an acrobat.  First in Paris, then in London, Lulu supports herself and her entourage by becoming a prostitute, with Schigolch and Alwa acting as her pimps.

Several parties try to blackmail Lulu, and she is still wanted by the German police for Schon's murder.  After much bad luck, including a scandalous financial investment, Alwa, Schigolch and Lulu are living together in poverty.  The Countess returns, having bought Lulu's portrait in a gallery.  Lulu is clearly upset at the sight of the portrait by her dead painter husband.  A client, the Negro, arrives, and Alwa demands that he pay for Lulu's services in advance.  A fight between Alwa and the Negro ends with Alwa shot dead.  Schigolch hides Alwa's body.

The Countess, despondent over Lulu's apparent rejection, contemplates suicide, but refrains and vows to return to Germany and work for women's rights.  Lulu has a new client.  She is so intrigued with him that she offers him sexual services for free, but it turns out the John is Jack the Ripper!  The Countess hears Lulu screams and discovers The Ripper, knife in hand.  The slasher then kills the Countess and escapes.

Themes of Catholicism and homosexuality permeate Py's stagings.  His Lulu begins with neon lights flashing: ""I Hate Sex."" Py's Lulu, as portrayed and sung by Patricia Petitbon, has no real control over her fate.  The only tool she has is in her sexual charisma, which she shrewdly uses to her advantage.  Clearly, Lulu was shaped by her treatment at the hands of her father, Schigolch, and patron, Schon.  Neither Py nor Petitbon, however, succumb to phony sentimentalism.  Py's sets are adorned in violent, nauseating, kaleidoscope colors which call to mind something akin to the hues of Miles Davis ""Live Evil"" period.  These colors echo the femme fatale characterization of Lulu, for whom sexual predation is but a past time.

The opening begins like something out of Tod Browning`s The Show (1927) with Lulu presented by the Ringmaster as the main attraction among his wild beasts.  A sprightly ape, a bobble head, and assorted animals appear before Lulu emerges, robed in man-eater red.  A mere few minutes into the film, Lulu disrobes and she will be nude off and on throughout the film.

Amidst the carnival milieu are sex shops, funeral homes, and pornographic cinemas.  Couples engage in simulated sexual acts in shop windows as the Painter fornicates with a bound Lulu.  A ferris wheel continually churns behind all.  When Schigolch arrives, he is dressed as an Emmett Kelly style tramp clown.  Lulu dons a pink bunny suit and goes down on him.  Conductor Michael Boder masterfully handles this extremely difficult score, alternating between jagged harmonies and free jazz, without skipping a beat.

As Schon reveals Lulu's true nature to the Painter, death appears from above as a well-endowed topless woman in a black miniskirt and a death's head mask.  A large portrait paints Lulu as the eternal scapegoat temptress of Genesis: Eve.

The mobile set shifts from a clutter of excessive wealth to Py's silent staged interlude, where Lulu is roughly interrogated by the police on minimalistic, black and white, silent film-styled sets.  Much hubbub was made over the projection of a real hardcore film on the set, but the porn is blurred and witnessed by a jaded, anonymous crowd.  The Painter reappears, in black face, as the Negro.  The mobile set set shifts again for a finale doused in snow.  Schon reappears as the Ripper, attired in a Santa Claus suit, and does his dirty deed with abandoned glee.

Py's Lulu was met with both standing ovations and attempts to ban the touring production in some areas.  ""Lulu"" has been filmed several times.  Christine Schafer made a superb Lulu in a 1996 production.  She was helped enormously there by Andrew Davis' superb conducting, but Graham Vick's production was a bit too minimalistic.  In a 2002 staging, Laura Aikin, while vocally no match for Schafer, likewise made a compelling Lulu, presenting the character as an unquestionable victim of Schon.  However, this beautiful and violent production utilized the now obsolete two-act version of the opera, and conductor Franz Wesler-Most could not seem to master the score to the degree Davis did.  Although all three of these versions have much going for them, Py's Lulu is the most successfully filmed Lulu to date.  Like Berg, Py filters the hedonistic source material from Wedekind through artistic sophistication.  Despite the supposed ""shock elements"" of Py's production, the director shows cerebral restraint in the depiction of violence and wisely concentrates on the terrifying sexual absurdity of the opera.
