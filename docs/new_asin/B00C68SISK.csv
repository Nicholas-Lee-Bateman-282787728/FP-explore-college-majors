8577541,2,B00C68SISK,"Review for Lionhead -- Like driving by a head-on collision's aftermath, I couldn't look away from this catastrophic farce of a film.  I kept watching just to see how grisly the destruction ahead would be, and its earned a bit of approval simply for keeping my attention.  However, Lionhead has little to recommend it. The scripts so stupid it's comedic, which is not necessarily a detrimental attribute -- I've watched and enjoyed my fair share of stupid-funny films -- but as the story here is seriously derivative, that lack of originality and the flatness of its characters count heavily against it. The action, as a young man gains, loses, then regains his fortune, has a Keystone Kops quality, and though there are just a few characters going in various directions, their every movement is ridiculous. The lack of uniqueness and individuality produces caricatures rather than characters, each almost a cardboard cutout fashioned to embrace stereotypical conformity and though there is a definite arch to the story, none of its players is altered as the tale progresses. Many viewers may recognize the aging comic actor, Woody Allen's singular style in the young man playing Lionheads main character here, as he delivers his lines often, but not consistently, akin to old self-absorbed, analysis-crazy, woe-is-me Woody. He revs up the whining during the greater part of his dialogue, generally in a sorry-for-myself diatribe, then falls out of character, forgets old Woody, and becomes a different person altogether when delivering the less self-oriented lines. If the actor had been more consistent, this affectation would have been a more apt tribute to Mr. Allens unique style and thus would be more worthy of applause. I'm focusing heavily on the hero of the story as this film relies heavily on this character, following this recently spurned young lover as he bemoans his loss, compounded by a financial loss, yet the two lovers show no emotion when  the live-in girlfriend/fiancee/exfiancee/fiancee again appears. They lack on-screen chemistry and the couple seem to be together simply because they've found no better options. The young suitor, with little good in his life, lacking friends and family, is a loser who is continually expecting others to endure his extended diatribes  as he bemoans his situation, yet he takes no responsibility for his choices which have led to his current predicament, nor does he hope for or work towards positive change. He just wants to whine, and, as anybody who has ever known someone whose company is so unpleasant can attest, this type of individual quickly wears out his welcome everywhere he goes. I wasn't a Woody Allen fan to begin with, so seeing this poor imitation of his uncomfortable, wallowing in misery, yet supposedly comedic acting really turns me off. Watch and listen for just a few minutes, and I'm sure you'll agree that this Woody mimic and his superbly annoying, whining, nasally voice grates on the senses. I just want to slap him upside the head for his idiocy. As that idiocy is the driving force behind the inane plot of Lionhead, I do recommend the movie to anyone who feels the need to either ridicule or feel superior to a daft young man who is stupid enough to fall for an obvious hustle, taken in by a smalltime, loser criminal, but who then goes on to befriend that hustler and is drawn into the crook's ridiculous life which is a parody of every shoot 'em up gangster flick ever made. Just when you think the storyline can't sink any lower, the most expensive fish ever is introduced, both commodity and almost-character yet sans any anthropomorphic qualities, thank goodness. If they'd given the fish human qualities, it would have become more important to the story than our whiny hero. As is, the fish is no more exotic than those carnival goldfish won by tossing a dime into a dish, yet it's provided with more color and individuality than any other character in the film... but hey, maybe that's the whole point of the movie?!",1475798400,,4013,4.949554896142433

8577543,1,B00C68SISK,"I quit after 1.34 minutes. The opening ""philosophy"" by the dad was excruciatingly sophomoric. The jewelry+plus+cross hanging from his neck was a retard's image of a tough guy. The business of waving a gun and promising to use it if his daughter has a bad time with her suitor was just unrealistically stupid. If I were to watch more of this, the one to really blame for stupidity should be me.",1473206400,,393,4.549295774647887

8577546,5,B00C68SISK,"I was flat out amazed by the fact that this was one of their first movies. Chris Renniers' writing skills were great. The script just keeps getting funnier everytime we watch it. Tommy Rennier Directing skillsets were great as well. Hmmm, reminds me of a couple of other brothers who have made great films. I only wish their next product was done. Keep it up Rennier's.",1381017600,2,369,4.606060606060606
