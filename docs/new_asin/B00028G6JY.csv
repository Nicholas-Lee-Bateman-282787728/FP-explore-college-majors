8023738,2,B00028G6JY,"This video series is old - probably recorded in the late 1980's or early 1990's. While I agree with others - the B&W clips of the Blues Greats are fantastic, this video series pales next to the more modern video lessons.  I originally purchased this set on VHS - Throughout the entire series, the instructor's guitar is not tuned to pitch. This would kind of be okay if the instructor did a ""Full Tune-up"" at the beginning of the lesson. Unfortunately, he only plays the High E string. I'm sure if I was as good a player as he, I would have no trouble getting in tune from just one string. But I'm not and it was a real pain to have to re-tune every time I wanted to work with this set.

I called the Guitar Workshop - the group that made this series. I was told that VHS tapes stretch and it was to be expected. When this series came out on DVD - I bought it. Again, the lesson is not tuned to pitch.

As I noted, there are some good things in this series, but mostly a lot of incomplete fragments. I own a number of the most recent DVDs by this same instructor and the Guitar Workshop - they are great. I strongly encourage you to explore those lessons and take a pass on this. Many of the songs included in this set have been re-recorded by this instructor and others who produce excellent lesson for the Guitar Workshop.",1472342400,,1324,4.2047244094488185

8023742,5,B00028G6JY,"some great footage of the legendary characters who were still around in the 50's and 60's,  Stefan as always personable and with magic fingers that seem capable of anything.  so much material -you could cherry pick the bits you can relate to for decades.",1404345600,,254,4.75
8023743,2,B00028G6JY,"When I got this I thought it was a joke. Yes the old footage is cool, but unfortunately this was filmed before youtube. I have seen all this footage already. My gripe with this set of instruction is that there is no instruction at all. You watch Stephan play the songs and then he refers you to the tab. He doesn't explain anything about what he is doing. If I wanted to learn songs off tab I would have just stuck to the internet. I don't see the point in spending time trying to figure out the tab, it is frustrating to say the least. I was under the impression he would pick apart each song piece by piece and show you how to play...

Absolute waste of money IMO. Now the lessons from Ernie Hawkins are great, but the best lessons I have come across are from Kenny Sultan.

Stephan Grossman is a horrible teacher, it is laughable when he literally tells you to go and look at the tab. Why should I look at tab, I thought I paid you so I wouldn't have to look at tab.",1338940800,,969,4.094736842105263
8023744,2,B00028G6JY,"I've heard nothing but rave reviews for Grossman's teaching skills and really wanted to start adding fingerpicking blues to my arsenal...
and so I went for it.

I actually picked up all three volumes of ""Country Blues Guitar"" and went through them slowly...
well...
telling someone, ""Just look at what he did there"" after watching an antique piece of footage doesn't cut it for teaching.
And then Grossman will simply play the piece, albeit a little slower than it's played ""to help you"".

You could get more teaching from a book, any book, with a CD. Sorry Grossman, I'm sure there's something out there that's great but this
wasn't it.

That said, I'm still keeping this collection...
why?
Well, the old footage is well worth the price.
I can't tell you how many times I've watched the Reverand play ""Tear these walls down"", just freakin' amazing.

So, if you want to watch someone play, this is the ticket...
But if you're looking to learn, this just ain't your train.",1294531200,3,971,4.727810650887574
8023745,5,B00028G6JY,"This is my favorite collection of country blues and ragtime tunes. Stefan Grossman is an excellent teacher and the DVD-based lessons really help you progress quickly compared to just working with the tab. There's plenty of material here to keep you busy for an extended period of time and its nicely graded with each new tune introducing something new. I'd say you need to have some basic chords down before you start but after that you should be able to dive right in and be playing ""Freight Train"" before you know it. The price might seem a little high compared to some other alternatives but you are getting 3 complete volumes here that previously were sold separately so its actually very good value for money.",1226275200,11,714,4.72
8023746,5,B00028G6JY,"NOTE:  This is not Volume 3, but 3 volumes in one.

Stefan Grossman is known world wide as a blues expert, these DVDs reveal something entirely different:  a very down to earth superstar who possesses something that not all those of world-class talent possess:  the gift of teaching!

It is of very little value to see a guitar superstar sweep through licks and they ""show"" them to students.  ""Show"" is not instruction.  Grossman has been recognized by none other than Martin Guitar with a signature guitar in his honor.  Yet, for all of his accomplishments, it is easy to overlook the gift of teaching he possesses.  What does this exactly mean?

It means that we, the students, can expect him to break down material into small, easy to digest pieces.  He skillfully anticipates where students will need a boost, where to pause the DVD, when to listen to a performance, and when to press on.

One of the most dominant themes in Stefan's DVD teachings is this:  As you learn a song, whether you like it or not, LEARN IT.  As you progress into the next song, and the next song, and the next, you will find that he has chosen the songs very, very carefully, as each one builds upon the other.  If you go ahead to song #3, having skipped the first two, it will not flow as easily as if it did when you follow his instructions.  He is a professor who KNOWS how to teach.  Listen to him.  Follow instructions.  Use the pause button generously.  Do not skip anything.

Then, go out and get everything this gem of a man has recorded.  He presents with no blaring ego, and even turns a bit red when he attempts to sing.  His humility shines through as he easy personality gently takes you for a learning ride on an easy curve.  For fun, you can start the DVD at the last song, be a bit overwhelmed, and then go back and start at song one.  By the end, you will be so pleased with your progress.

Better yet, keep a journal of your progress.  Write down what you studied, how you did, what you did not like, what you liked...everything.  One DVD purchase from Stefan Grossman may translate into 3 months of private lessons with one of the world's top blues craftsman.  I cannot say whether or not he is a better performer or better teacher:  it is virtually indistinguishible.  The DVD is that good.

I suggest ""How to Play Blues Guitar"" Vol 1 through Vol 3.  By the time you have finished volume 3, you will be immeasurably pleased with your progress and thoroughly addicted to Grossman's teaching.  He is that one teacher in high school that got through to you and made learning exciting!",1217808000,13,2581,4.45610278372591
