2620664,5,B000GY73UK,"In my opinion, this DVD really rocks.  Of course, I should point out that I'm a fan of wrestling, Christy Hemme, and hot talented ladies.  If you like Christy Hemme, Jackie Gayda, Gail Kim, SoCal Val and Traci, you're sure to love this DVD.",1167782400,4,240,4.431818181818182
2620665,2,B000GY73UK,"This was basically TNA's attempt at doing a DVD similar to the WWE Divas DVD's that they put out every year.  The only difference here is that these TNA knockouts aren't out on television every other week in wet t-shirts, bra & panties, or skimpy outfits so you don't get the mentality of ""why buy the DVD when I can see this for free on TV every week.""

Christy Hemme, Jackie (Ms. Jackie in WWE), Traci Brooks, Gail Kim, and the ring girl So Cal Val are all profiled on here with footage from their photoshoots from the TNA website & Sole magazine.  They tell their backgrounds of growing up, getting into the business, and their time & roles in TNA and a sideshow after each presentation.

Also on here is a match between Gail Kim vs. Traci Brooks that was a nice little womens wrestling match...not a bra & panties type of match you would see divas like Torrie Wilson & Candice Michelle but actual wrestling like Trish, Victoria, or Mickie James would give you.  And there are also little features like Traci going to a baseball game looking for a guy.  The DVD itself is around around an hour & a half.

Bottom line is just these type of Diva/Knockout DVD's are only worth watching maybe once or twice and then it loses it's value.  This is good for a rental but it's a pass for anything else.",1158364800,14,1297,4.375
2620666,5,B000GY73UK,"The beautiful ladies of TNa Wrestling are shown in this DVD dedicated to them. See the lovely Jackie Gayda, the exotic Gail Kim, the seductive Tracy, and the fiery redhead Christy Hemme as they show WWE divas that they have some stiff competition when it comes to wrestling and great women in bathing suits!

This dvd will come with interviews with each woman plus great photo shoots for each woman. My favorite of the four, Christy Hemme, will hopefully get a chance to wrestle in TNA in the future, but for now I am happy with what she will show in the DVD.

Extras will include behind the scenes footage of the lovely ladies as well as interviews with people who work with them and what they think about the wrestling world from their point of view. I am also just guessing that there will be matches involving the ladies included in here but I think not much since it is speculated that it is just a one disk dvd..

Never the less if you are a fan of beautiful ladies who can actually wrestle [take a hint WWE] this is the dvd for you! This dvd is highly recommended...",1153612800,3,1073,4.355

8135118,5,B000GY73UK,This is one of my favorite TNA DVD releases. The running time is an hour and a half and leaves you wanting more. The profiles are excellent and well done. We learn about all four Knockouts. Gail Kim is probably the greatest female wrestler in the history of TNA. We learn about her background and even get to see a few scenes from an independent film she was in playing an assassin. Christy Hemme was very interesting. She is a very energetic and spunky girl who truly fit the spirit of TNA. We learn about her life growing up and her love for motorcycles. Traci Brooks was a fun profile as she goes to a baseball game looking to meet a guy. We learn a bit about her background and learn what a humble and good girl she is. Jackie Gayda's profile was great too. Jackie was well spoken and I found her uplifting. She had some inspiring words to share with young people growing up. There are plenty of great photos shown and you get to see the Knockouts in many outfits. This dvd has one match Traci vs Gail Kim. It was a good match. This dvd was made before TNA kick started their awesome Knockouts Division. It's a fun dvd to watch. It brings me back to the days when TNA had just started on Spike Tv. I remember that time being very exciting. It's a nice stroll down memory lane. I recommend this dvd to TNA Wrestling fans and all Wrestling fans. Cheers and Enjoy!,1393891200,2,1365,4.274131274131274
8135119,4,B000GY73UK,"From the cover to the content, this DVD is a winner. Besides signing Kurt Angle back in 2006, is there any doubt that TNA's most successful imprint on the current landscape of pro wrestling is their women's division, whose members are aptly nicknamed the Knockouts. This is the first of 2 TNA releases devoted specifically to these hot, talented, hot, driven, ambitious, and hot ladies. (Did i mention they're hot?)
Even though this set is several years old (come on TNA, how about a volume 3 some year??), it's a good intro for newbies, and certainly a must-own for fans. I mean, they had me at the cover alone; it could have contained 4 hours of test patterns and TNA would have still gotten my dough. Even WWE fans know Christy Hemme is re-donk-ulous; she won their 2004 Diva Search (actual money prize:$250,000...NOT kayfabed, real!). Jackie Gayda is also a WWE also-ran; honestly, besides a hard body, she doesn't bring much to the party.
At least Traci Brooks is a worker. She may APPEAR as though she was plucked from one of Orlando's finer gentleman's clubs, but she (now) has over a decade of actual in-ring, woman-on-woman, flesh-on-flesh....uuhhh....I mean, she's actually competed for over a decade now.
  But I've saved the best for last. The incomparably gorgeous young athlete in the center is, frankly, reason enough for anyone who has even the slightest amount of affection for pro wrestling/sports entertainment/smokin' babes in tights. First, let me get this outta my system-She knocks me on my doodle. She could act as the ultimate litmus test for heterosexuality-if you find a dude who could resist her, let's just say that person IS allowed to join the military providing they're of the most discreet personal makeup.
  But proper rasslin' fans know Gail Kim is a lot more than wallpaper on a PC, or the finest physical specimen her gender can provide. The girl can WORK. But it and find out.",1327708800,5,1914,4.844036697247707
8135120,5,B000GY73UK,Great condition!!! Learned a bit about the knockouts!! Only wish their were more matches and not all Gail Kim VS Awesome Kong! Although they were amazing matches!!,1310256000,3,163,5.074074074074074
8135121,2,B000GY73UK,Unlike the WWE This only has one match and alot of photo shoots which put me to sleep.  I think I will stick with the WWE.,1222041600,2,122,3.6923076923076925
8135122,4,B000GY73UK,"This is a pretty good dvd, just wish there were more matches instead of just one under the extra menu.  I found this on ebay for alittle over $10 brand new, it is prob. the best $10 I've spent in awhile.",1196812800,,203,3.951219512195122
8135123,5,B000GY73UK,"If you are a fan of any of the TNA Knockouts, I encourage you to buy this dvd! It shows teh ladies inside the ring and outside. It shows Miss Traci Brooks at a baseball game and lots of great photoshoots and personal info about the ladies. It also features a match between Gail and Traci. It would not be a wate of money, I assure you!",1181606400,2,335,4.014925373134329
