I wish I could get a refund for BAD TASTE.  Back to the drawing board people.",1437004800,,255,4.478260869565218
8626702,4,B00GSA3OTU,A great movie that made you wonder what's next?  A small town  country setting with an original big old house.,1391990400,2,110,4.45
8626703,5,B00GSA3OTU,"This movie, while being a bit different, and obviously lower budget, is hilarious! And the story about Ashley Judd... Well, let's just say that I hope it's true, because it had me laughing for the entire rest of the movie.

Great cast, and really good acting! Definitely better than  the Paranormal Activity series.",1384905600,2,315,4.9245283018867925
