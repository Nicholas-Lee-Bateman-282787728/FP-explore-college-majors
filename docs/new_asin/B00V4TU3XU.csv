7076713,4,B00V4TU3XU,"This must have been super indie because I never saw it in theaters.

This is the story of two American half brothers in Japan; one lives there teaching (not incredibly well) an all Japanese class and the other is visiting on business.  There is an unspoken weight that burdens their relationship.  The businessman wants to complete his business and get the hell out of there, rebuffing his brother's many advances to get together.  As it unfolds we see them forced to come together, hash things out, and...  Well. Watch the movie.

The actors are unknowns (to me) but they all do a wonderful job.  I've never been to Japan and I've always wanted to go.  Part of the fun of the movie is taking a tour of a place so different than America.  For film buffs, if you like older Japanese movies, this movie reminds me somewhat of a Japanese film: a lot of long takes, subtle sense of humor, many times stemming from social awkwardness.

If you like indies, family dramas and low key romance, then give it a shot.",1454544000,4,1006,4.50828729281768
7076714,5,B00V4TU3XU,"A truly beautiful film! It's funny, heartwarming, and beautifully shot. Loved it!",1454457600,2,81,5.833333333333333
7076715,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Poignant, funny, lovely.  Kudos to the filmmakers.",1454457600,2,50,6.142857142857143
7076716,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Touching, funny, and nuanced. Acting is top notch. Tokyo through the eyes of these filmmakers is beautiful.",1454457600,,107,5.352941176470588
7076717,5,B00V4TU3XU,"This is a beautiful and meaningful film. It is funny, touching, and sticks with you. You'll also find yourself quoting the movie to your friends. It is a story about relationships, family, loneliness, healing, and finding unexpected joy. Excellent direction, acting, and writing. If you want a break from meaningless fluff, buy this movie.",1454025600,2,339,5.296296296296297

7076719,5,B00V4TU3XU,"For what appears to be an independently budgeted film, this was quite enjoyable. I had watched it a month back and recommended it to my wife, who is a Japanese national and works as a translator for a Japanese company in the US.

A month later when I asked her about it, she had yet to watch it, so we sat down together and watched it (myself for a 2nd time).

My wife and I really appreciated the funny quips that some foreigners in Japan run into (myself included) that were laced throughout the film.

If you have any interest in Japan or have any Japanese national friends or family that understand English, this is a great film to share.",1473465600,,642,4.333333333333333
7076720,3,B00V4TU3XU,Entertaining.  good acting but kind of dreary in theme.,1472342400,,55,5.111111111111111
7076721,2,B00V4TU3XU,"It's not easy finding two less interesting characters than the two half-brothers in this movie. I suppose we should be glad that only one of them is portrayed as a total neurotic ass. To keep us entertained, the script adds a ghost in the mix, assorted unpleasant Japanese characters, or simply does not bother explaining major points in the storyline (like who is the deceased Jack). This sophomoric film is a lot shallower than what its creators aspired. Not recommended.",1470960000,,473,4.925
7076722,1,B00V4TU3XU,Boooooring!,1470700800,,11,11.0
7076723,5,B00V4TU3XU,"really good job welldone for a small budget film. the actors are superb, even if still have some experiences to be gained. quite different and genuine, dialogues are very natural.

the part with mom could be better. but overall, just refreshing from the hollywood stuff.  wish there was some resolution with the relationship he kind of just let go for no reason.",1470096000,,362,4.82258064516129
7076724,5,B00V4TU3XU,"I really enjoyed this movie.  At times, the realism was hard to watch, but ultimately a sweet and moving film.  Set in modern Tokyo and surrounding areas, so not only was the storyline great, I also enjoyed being back in the city of my childhood.",1469059200,,246,4.444444444444445

7076727,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Awesome film, I found myself laughing out loud more times than I expected to. Great job with the on screen chemistry between the two brothers.",1465516800,,142,4.72
7076728,3,B00V4TU3XU,"Interesting idea, but a little slow paced. Great acting all around however.",1465257600,3,75,5.333333333333333
7076729,5,B00V4TU3XU,Really great movie! Kept me interested throughout the whole movie. It makes me want to visit Japan soon.,1464912000,,104,4.833333333333333

7076731,2,B00V4TU3XU,"Sorry I spent any time watching this.  Not well made and doesn't show strong knowledge of basic Japanese customs, such as taking off your shoes when you enter a home.  Too often, people reviewing smaller films tend to be related to the actors and writers.  As soon as I see nearly all 5 stars, it's obvious.",1463011200,3,307,4.446428571428571
7076732,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Great story, characters, development.  Wish there were more movies like this out there.
Clearly a labor of love.  Hopefully, somebody with the means will give the creators more opportunities to make films.",1462492800,2,205,5.375
7076733,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Everything about this movie was spectacular!  The writing, the actors Warren and Brent....Well done!  As I watched these 2 characters, I felt the tension of their awkward relationship, and many times funny as hell when they exchanged small talk.  I felt their sadness of losing people and things they love, and more ups and downs of LIFE as we all know it.  All of these emotions are gorgeously captured in every sharp scene along with a beautiful tour of Japan!  I cried, I laughed, I was content and happy.  After watching this movie, the emotional roller coaster I went through was magnificent and when that happens.....IT'S JUST A DAMN GOOD MOVIE!",1462492800,,651,4.81981981981982
7076734,5,B00V4TU3XU,this film took me by surprise.  it is funny and touching and has a unique personality.  its like diving into a still pond and finding a refreshing underwater current.  bravo to the heretofore unknown lead actors [who are also the writers.]  they're both fantastic.  japan as backdrop is both exotic and accessible -  and beautifully shot.  im glad independent movies like this one can still get made.,1462233600,,400,4.880597014925373
7076735,5,B00V4TU3XU,"I stumbled across this while searching for another film with ""dog"" in the title, and I'm so glad I did! This is a very sweet and moving film about the complexities of  adult sibling relationships and the whole ""what am i doing with my life?"" question that we all ask ourselves at some point. It's beautifully shot and a love story to Japan as well. Two thumbs up!",1462147200,,363,4.338235294117647
7076736,5,B00V4TU3XU,"I grew up in Tokyo, and have recently been back there.  This film captures so many nuanced aspects of the culture and the random pleasantries of modern day Japan.  It's almost hard for me to critique technical aspects of the film, because it had done such a great job of just being real.  The are so many human-condition moments in the film that are typically sanitized out of films for the sake of mass-appeal, and I really appreciate both the honesty and boldness of this film to just put in out there and be so unapologetic and do it with such taste and artfulness.  I can't help but put this film in the same class as Lost in Translation and About a Boy...  I am looking forward to Warren and Brent's next move.",1462060800,4,715,4.345864661654136
7076737,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Clever humor and insider scenes of Japan. A reminder that there are no solutions to life, it's fragility and our relationships other than humility, forgiveness and love. Recognized by several independent film festivals. Please support the artists that pulled this humorous yet delicately raw snapshot together.",1461888000,,310,5.760869565217392
7076738,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Great movie, cast and soundtrack! Elliot's internal struggle is nicely complimented throughout the movie by the comic relief in the awkwardness of his relationship with his half brother and the cultural differences in Japan. His journey to make sense of the past in order to move forward is relatable in many ways. I laughed outloud at the fight scene!",1461801600,,352,4.983050847457627
8709250,5,B00V4TU3XU,"This movie did something extraordinarily:  When the two main characters were saying an awkward goodbye at the end, I felt they were also saying an awkward goodbye to me, and I to them.  I didn't want to say goodbye, but was glad to have seen what I did.  Much like the main characters themselves.

I can't think of the last time I got sucked into the gentle pace and meandering flow of a movie so much that I forgot I'm actually sitting here watching a movie.

I normally have things to say about the script, the cast, the sets and locations, the photography, and so on.  Not this time.

Perhaps it resonates with my own past, not as events or relationships, but in the general emotional tone.  Maybe.  I don't know.",1510963200,,716,4.404580152671755
8709251,5,B00V4TU3XU,A wonderfully human movie that touched my heart.  Thank you to the artists who brought this to the world.,1505779200,,105,4.526315789473684
8709252,2,B00V4TU3XU,"I watched this movie on Prime, hoping to gain more insights about Westerners visiting Japan. But this dog of a movie suffers from a weak storyline and weaker storytelling. It really needed the hand of a successful screenwriter and a more experienced director. The movie appears to be autobiographical, with the two lead actors/directors/producers/writers using a number of their family members in various production and acting parts, according to the screen credits.

Elliott (Brent Willis) is way over-the-top in his role as a businessman reluctantly sent to Japan. He's a jerk with obvious personal issues that extend beyond what the film is showing. He is made crankier by jet lag and takes his angst out on everyone around him. It's just a film, but I cringed when seeing Elliott play the ugly American role to the hilt, insulting polite Japanese at every turn. I have seen that attitude when I lived in Japan, but never to this extent, as he refuses to speak any Japanese or engage in respecting/ understanding the culture.

The viewer is one-third of the way into the movie before learning that Elliott and Ben are half-brothers.  Ben (Warren Sroka) is a amiable English teacher and a much-more believeable character than Elliott, who I cannot see any US or Japanese company paying to send to Japan with his state of mind. All the Japanese actors used in this film are very credible in their respective roles and I give the filmmakers credit for casting them. Likewise the camera work and editing are pretty good, that is, when they're not showing Elliott frequently rushing through Tokyo crowds in a bewildered manner.

Elliott is so unlikeable and dominant in the lead role that it almost doesn't matter that it was filmed in Japan--The viewer is too often distracted by Elliott's attitude and the stilted and antagonistic dialogue between brothers, making it hard to appreciate the Japanese surroundings. The script seemed more appropriate for a 2-act off-Broadway play than for a feature film. But I did watch to the unresolved bitter end, just to make sure that Elliott got his ugly-American butt on the plane and far away from Japan. I rarely leave comments on movies for Amazon, but the 5-star ratings for this film are not realistic.",1500076800,,2247,4.936507936507937
8709253,1,B00V4TU3XU,"An entire movie about a forty something grumpy man, but not in a funny way.  Grumpy man goes to Japan for work.  He is grumpy at work.  Meets his long lost brother and abuses him with his endless grumpiness.  Is surrounded by Japan's coolness, but he is grumpy.  Movie ends.  Man is still grumpy.  I wasted over an hour of my life watching a movie about a grumpy man.",1496534400,,367,4.231884057971015
8709254,3,B00V4TU3XU,"The movie just didn't seem all that original. It pretty much reminded me of the movie ""Lost in Translation.""  Similar story line and all the Japanese characters are portrayed with very little depth. It's understandable in Lost in Translation because that was the experience that the main character had when he was in Japan as a westerner.  But the main character in this movie was raised by a Japanese mother, so most likely he would have been exposed to the Japanese culture by that age more or less, but he acts like a total stranger to the culture as if we he was raised by a Caucasian mother. Throughout the movie, I felt the gloomy undertone and we can't help but wonder ""why is his brother putting up with such a negative, depressing person?""  It just wasn't realistic, and if it was not meant to be because it's a comedy, why do I feel so not amused?",1495238400,,857,4.445859872611465
8709255,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Excellent job, written, directed and acted by Warren Sroka and Brent Willis...just brilliant in all aspects, heart felt as well.  One of the best comedies I have watched..",1492819200,,171,5.107142857142857
8709256,5,B00V4TU3XU,"Such a good movie. Reminds me a bit of Ramen Girl, w/Brittany Murphy (character coming up against personal struggles of life, love, and set in Japan). It's true, I sometimes  had trouble following, like who is Jack? But not saying explicitly gave the effect for the viewer of being in a foreign country, not being able to follow anything quite, and feeling distanced from your own.",1484352000,,381,4.7727272727272725
