Im sittin there watching this movie and watching Mike skating spots that aren't that great but im also remembering doing that for years and literally skating a mere bank or parking block for hours on end. Then coming home sweaty or frost bitten (Illinois) and watching skate vids and reading Thrasher or Transworld. I was just so caught up in it that I breathed skating. I must say I kind of lost that motivation somewhere down the line but ive always had a board in case of situations like this. I just got this dvd way late but I gotta say I could use the word ""beautiful"" to describe it.

The soundtrack, meshes with the skating, which in turn gives a total visual of the message Mikes getting across Which in turn, makes ME wanna go skate.",1128038400,5,816,4.476510067114094
7977993,5,B00007L4NJ,"Drive is probably the heart of all skate videos. It explains the true meaning of skateboarding in a way that anyone could understand.

Drive is the story of Mike Vallely, who in my opinion is the most original skaters on the scene today. He has his own style and his own values about skateboarding.  Values that you don't usually hear in skate videos or see on TV.  The parks that are hit up in the video aren't always the big mainstream ones you see in other videos.  Mike rides just about everything from parking lots to random spots of pavement, yet somehow he manages to make everything look impressive.  Every trick is executed with his unique style of street.  His tricks are technical and old school at the same time.  Some of the moves I've seen him do I can't even name.

When I first watched this video it really touched me. The way he was visiting fans and giving them his insights on the sport and actually skating the streets these kids skated on every day.  Its not every day you see a professional athlete go out of his way and take time off of his career to see his fans and just make a video that makes as much sense as this.  ""Once you've been moved, once you've been inspired how can you not want to get out there and share it with the world."" Near the end of the video Mike is sitting outside the house he grew and talks about why he's in the sport and why he loves it so much.

To sum things up this is a great buy.  I only actually own 3 skate videos and this is by far the most valuable. Every time a watch it I just want to hit the streets with my board hard. If you are just getting into the skate scene or have been skating for a long time this video is a must have.",1126051200,3,1692,4.109422492401216
7977994,5,B00007L4NJ,Drive is not only a demonstration of the incredible skating skills of Mike Vallely but an introduction to him as a person.  He is a true individual who isn't afraid to speak his mind and be his own person.  He refuses to cater to any ideals outside his own.  He also comes across as a genuinely nice guy who wants to help others and spread a positive message.  He is the real deal and in this video he shows what skating is all about.,1094083200,2,434,4.130952380952381
7977995,5,B00007L4NJ,"Amazing. Absolutely brilliant.
Mike understands the core. He understands what the skate culture IS, and what I hope the culture never looses. Powerful film, and without a doubt, a powerful skateboarder.",1083196800,,202,5.548387096774194
7977996,5,B00007L4NJ,"Very good, if you are skater; have to see...Mike V. proves a human with good perspective of life and for the messages in this DVD values a lot!",1070496000,,143,4.142857142857143
7977997,5,B00007L4NJ,"Honestly this is the BEST movie/Dcoumetry I have ever seen. I am a fan of Skateboarding, of Mike Vallely, and of life....So this just hits home, and hard!  IF you never watch another movie, watch this first.  IT might not change your life but you think about it diffrently.  its worht more then you will ever pay for it! ""You want to change your life? Start with your perspective!""",1066694400,2,381,4.492753623188406
7977998,5,B00007L4NJ,"This is one of the best sk8 videos I ever. Mike V is truly a deep, thoughtful, talented, dedicated, tough, sk8er. This video drives that home. It follows Mike on a criss-cross journey around the USA and other countries, on a mission to ""promote skating as a positive form of creative Self expression"".
The skating is great. Mike V does some sick tricks. He has one of the most unique styles around. Nobody does the stuff he does. But he also is one of the most thoughtful and insightful sk8ers around. All of the scenes are voiced over with his thoughts and perceptions about sk8ing and life in general. He takes the time to drive down to Florida to visit a fan with cancer. He drives his own car 1000+ miles to go meet & hang out with a child that may not live long enough to ever sk8 again. And he does it simply because he wanted the kid to have a positive experience about sk8ing and a chance to make one day in his life better. Mike V. is dedicated to his beliefs on a level that few people can even perceive let alone achieve.
The cinematography is gorgeous. The music is good. The sk8ing is rad. Buy this DVD if you like Mike V. Buy this DVD if you like Sk8ing. Buy this DVD if you simply want to watch something that makes you want to deepen your convictions, whatever they may be.",1057795200,,1289,4.2439024390243905
7977999,5,B00007L4NJ,"This is the greatest skateboarding related video I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot). Not so much for the skating that's in it (which is pretty great), but for the message in it. If you are a skater, were a skater, know a skater and you want to understand it better, get this. Now. No excuses. Mike Vallely is a true ambassador of good will for skateboarding, and this video proves it. If you're dissapointed by this video, then you don't love skateboarding. It was far better than I expected and presents a message that the entire skateboarding community needs to hear. And there is some pretty great skating to go along with it.",1045785600,3,633,4.4655172413793105
