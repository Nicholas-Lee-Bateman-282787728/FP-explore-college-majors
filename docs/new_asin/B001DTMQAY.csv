8294852,5,B001DTMQAY,"Being the history nut that I am I love reading, watching, or listening to anything that allows me to learn more about history.  For me the books, or films, produced during a certain time tell me more than any post-period piece.  Why learn about what a historian thinks about life during the American Civil War when you can read about the home front from the writings of a woman or family who lived it?  Why read about what a historian thinks about military training of the Second World War when you can watch the training films the troops watched?  So when I found out about a film that dealt with wartime nutrition, during World War Two, I wanted it.  Now, it is only ten minutes long but it is full of historical goodness.  For example, when showing the kitchens, mess halls, and food classes of that period - the film was made in 1943 - we see only white women and blacks.  Now we see one white guy, looks like a naval cook, working to make a meal but that's it.  Even the people in the lunch lines, mostly white males, are being served by white females or blacks.  In fact I can only think of one scene where a gentlemen of color is shown eating one of the meals.  There isn't a hint that is this abnormal or wrong - this is society in the 40's.  Racism is in the fabric of this culture.
Much of the film feels like something you would see while taking a high school home economics course but with a dash of a war time propaganda.  The film states the fact that the English have never eaten so well - even when compared to prewar years - and sounds a tad weird to me but it may be true.  Truly they would have had to make do with less and were rationing well before the USA entered the war.  A amazing look at home front life and a interesting addition to any DVD collection.",1354233600,,1779,4.194117647058824
