7013175,1,B00TLXIJCS,"As sometimes happens in real life, this movie is less about the wedding couple and more about the guests.  It attempts to make the viewer privvy to the humorous interactions that can ensue when two families meet.  However, due to disjointed writing, undeveloped acting and an overdose of caricatures, the viewer is left feeling like the honeymoon phase never started.  Six bucks wasted!",1440374400,,386,5.095238095238095

7013182,4,B00TLXIJCS,ALTON & KENYA'S OUTRAGEOUS WEDDING is an entertaining & funny look at all of the behind the scenes madness surrounding the wedding of a couple who come from different sides of the tracks.  Likeable cast and some good performances made this an enjoyable movie to watch!  Great to see some recognizable faces like Debra Wilson from MAD TV and Hayley Marie Norman from TOP FIVE.,1434412800,,375,4.753846153846154
7013183,1,B00TLXIJCS,"Alton and Kenya get married in spite of the ""DC thing."" We get briefly introduced to a group of poorly developed characters and then on to the wedding and reception where there is a lot of gossip, but there is nothing outrageous. In fact it was very tame. One of the characters was a white guy who had a fear of black people. The script was boring and terrible.

You would be better off watching ""Jumping the Broom"" again.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Some adult talk.",1433548800,,476,4.3977272727272725

8702310,1,B00TLXIJCS,"Very predictable. Did the groom sleep with strippers at his bachelor's party. Why write that part in if you are not going to give an explanation for it being written. I did understand it at all,",1457481600,,194,4.416666666666667
