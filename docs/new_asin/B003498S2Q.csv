8453975,1,B003498S2Q,"I purchased these movies in a physical store.  There was nothing on them to indicate that I was getting 1 dvd that was a total of 13 minutes in length and another that was a total of 16 minutes in length.  As a matter of fact the Shrek one says it is an ""Ogre size adventure"".  Would you really think this meant a 16 minute movie short?  That is what you would usually get as a freebie when you buy a bonus pack or something.
I am very disappointed with Dreamworks on this one.  Grossly misadvertised and really they did not enable me, the consumer, to know this I was purchasing video shorts when I picked it up off of the shelf.  One of the video backs was covered because of the way it was packaged, I was not able to see how long it was.",1296777600,,741,4.041095890410959
8453976,4,B003498S2Q,My children loved these movies.  They come with the 3D glasses and there is a short game to play as one of the extras on the bobs big break DVD. The only down side is that the movies are very short; maybe 15-20 minutes each.,1289001600,2,224,3.977777777777778
