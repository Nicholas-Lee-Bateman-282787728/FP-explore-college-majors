7879234,5,6304907133,"Honey, Taught both of my children how to swim in California as we had swimming pools and both of our houses. She was fantastic and had both of my children swimming by one! You could throw them in the poola and they could find their way to steps and get out. No floaty's for my kids that was just a false sense of security and Honey felt that way too. Every year for nine years I would call  January 1 and get on her books for the first session of lessons. She was the BEST by far and taught so many children in Southern California to  swim in the pool safe! I was so sad to hear of her passing  and bought this for my daughter who is now a mother  wishing honey was here to teach her daughter!. This might be the second best! She was an amazing woman and saved so many kids from drowning.",1467763200,,788,4.0
7879235,5,6304907133,When I was 2-3 yrs old my mother would take me to swimming classes with Honey.  Of course I don't remember much (it was 26 yrs ago) but I learned how to swim really fast and have always loved the water.  She was an excellent teacher.  I just had my first child a year ago and wanted to see if Honey still taught but unfortunately I learned that she had passed away.  It is a shame.  I heard she was working on a updated DVD that she never had the chance to make.  I bought her VHS in hopes to learn from her so I could teach my kids.  I haven't had the chance to watch it because I need to find a VHS player but wanted to review her tape anyway because she was the best of the best.,1261008000,,682,3.8285714285714287
