3892517,5,B002AUAND2,"Televisa produced a Yesenia soap opera for TV in 1970. The home video market didn't exist at the time and they produced a Yesenia movie starring Jacqueline Andere in 1971. Jorge Lavat and Irma Lozano played the same characters from the TV soap opera. Yesenia was also remade for Mexican TV in 1988 starring Adela Noriega. Yesenia, a young Gypsy girl, falls in love with a soldier. The two get married and they face difficulties in the face of racism and the socio-political climate.  There's a big plot twist in the story! Jacqueline Andere looked very sensual in 1971! Yesenia(1971) is a classic of Mexican Cinema.",1296864000,9,615,4.80188679245283

8360412,5,B002AUAND2,"I enjoy classic like this one. I saw the spanish tv soap many years ago with Adela Noriega and this movie is the drama but you can finish the movie within two hours. Tv soap takes longer, I rather enjoy the movie.",1391990400,,213,4.095238095238095
8360413,3,B002AUAND2,It's not a fullscreen item and definitely not high definition. I am disappointed because I paid the highest price of all the available Yesenia DVDs thinking that I would get the highest quality product but that wasn't the case.  This is my all-time favorite movie from Mexico!,1368316800,,276,4.872340425531915
8360414,4,B002AUAND2,I think that Yesenia is a classic of latin movies. Many mexican stars were part of this film. Jacqueline Andere is one of the most beautiful and succeful actress of Latinoamerica.,1367107200,,179,4.806451612903226

8360417,3,B002AUAND2,"the movie was released in 1971, not 1905 as Amazon indicated.  it's a love story with a happy ending.  the story line is nothing news: a girl born out of wedlock was abandoned by her rich family and brough up by a poor gypsy woman. later she not only found her prince charming, but also reunited with her birth mother and the rest of her family.  The 2 leading actresses, costumes & themes were all so beautiful. it's quite entertaining.",1342828800,2,437,4.4375
8360418,4,B002AUAND2,"I've seen the movie when I was a little girl, and I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It was made in 70th, so don't expect HD quality, but if you are into telenovellas , you will like it. My grandma liked this movie a lot, I remember how she took me to the theater to watch this movie first time, so when I had found it on Amazon I wanted to see it again kind of like a tribute to my grandma. It is like 3 hour version of that could be a telenovela, but in a movie format. Yesenia is very beautiful, and her partner was young at that time Jorge Lavat( Don Julio in Eva Luna), who passed away recently, my condolences to his family and fans. So if you are his fan and haven't seen this movie before, I'll recommend you to watch it.",1319328000,5,733,3.8933333333333335
