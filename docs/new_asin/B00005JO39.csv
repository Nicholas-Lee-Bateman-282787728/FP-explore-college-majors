But it's still funny enough to enjoy yourself and for sure not that much worse than most of them. What makes it special for me is, that ""Veronica's Closet"" starrs Kirstie Alley! OK, she gained some weight recently... but being sexy isn't everything. Kirstie is a wonderfull actress and I enjoyed all her roles so far, even if some of her movies didn't convince me entirely.

I hope this title will soon be available on DVD and I wish Kirstie all the best in order to find a new project (TV or movie) soon.",1151020800,21,598,4.4363636363636365

It's about time they get it out of the ''closet'' for people to remember the greatnes of comedy shows. Kirstie is absolutely adorable and funny as always and also supported by a great comedic cast ,like for example Kathy Najimi. Get it out...",1137196800,27,322,4.47457627118644
