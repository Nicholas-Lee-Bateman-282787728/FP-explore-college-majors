2652976,5,B000I3MBNI,"I loved this 1982-86 series about an artificially smart talking supercar with capabilities beyond imagination used to combat heavy-duty crime with the help of its pilot which was the reclusive freelance investigator Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)who gets rescued by dying eccentric billionaire Wilton Knight(Richard Basehart)with a new identity after nearly being killed in the line of duty as former police detective Michael Long.

The Foundation For Law & Government was headed by British overly concerned Devon Miles(Edward Mulhare)whom assigned Michael to cases involving criminals that the law couldn't touch.

Dr. Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson)was Devon's technical assistant and chief engineer technician in charge of KITT's maintenance, but was replaced by technician April Curtis(Rebecca Holden)in KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season in the Fall of 1983, but had returned to the show in the 3rd Season in the Fall of 1984.

KNIGHT RIDER was also my favorite childhood show and it takes me all the way back to memory lane to when KNIGHT RIDER was the bomb and I used to watch it every Friday at 9PM after the short-lived THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR at 8PM when KITT was the hottest car on Friday nights from October of 1982 thru August of 1983 when it stole the Dukes thunder since KNIGHT RIDER KO'd THE DUKES OF HAZZARD in the ratings when KNIGHT RIDER debuted on NBC in September of 1982 on the same weekend CBS started THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's 5th Season with the new Dukes Coy(Byron Cherry)and Vance(Chris Mayer)since John Schneider(Bo)and Tom Wopat(Luke)left the show in the Spring of 1982, due to a salary dispute which also resulted in the Dukes getting a huge slump in ratings and losing lots of viewers thru KNIGHT RIDER, especially since the General Lee wasn't the hottest car for Friday nights anymore since the Knight 2000 outclassed the General, especially since KNIGHT RIDER's ratings were soaring at an all time high while THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's ratings were sinking at an all time low, but then Bo and Luke were brought back on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Spring of 1983 and KNIGHT RIDER was moved to Sundays at 8PM in the Summer of 1983 which helped improve the Dukes ratings a little, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER still beat THE DUKES OF HAZZARD to a pulp.

Additionally, KNIGHT RIDER was a pioneer in many ways, because for 1 thing KNIGHT RIDER was the first show in futuristic, high-tech vehicles since KNIGHT RIDER's debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 inspired the creation of the superchopper series AIRWOLF on CBS in the Winter of 1984 and the short-lived supercycle series STREET HAWK on ABC in the Winter of 1985 which by the way were all Universal distributions that were all filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER, AIRWOLF, and STREET HAWK were all competitors and were all on rival networks since ABC had STREET HAWK on Fridays, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturdays at 9PM, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sundays at 8PM which eventually resulted in viewers getting too much of the same thing every weekend since AIRWOLF & STREET HAWK were too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER and had premiered not too long after one another which was probably why STREET HAWK tanked after only 10 weeks when ABC cancelled it in the Spring of 1985, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder which resulted in KNIGHT RIDER losing a lot of viewers thru STREET HAWK since the Knight 2000 was outclassed by the Street Hawk supercycle, so KITT was no longer the bomb or the hottest car on weekends anymore when STREET HAWK made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985.

Unfortunately KNIGHT RIDER tanked after its 4-year run on NBC and was cancelled in the Summer of 1986, due to a nose-dive in ratings.

Overall, I really don't understand why Universal feels such a need to re-release another Complete Series DVD box set of KNIGHT RIDER, especially in todays sluggish economy, especially since they already made and released one back in the Fall of 2008.",1376006400,4,4028,4.864431486880466
2652977,5,B000I3MBNI,"This appears to be a repackaging of the separate Knight Rider single season DVD sets.

I have purchased sets from amazon that contain combined DVD seasons multiple times and I have never been disappointing. In general it appears that they are reducing current stock by lumping things together. With this you get a great price. On amazon each of these seasons originally retailed for almost 30 dollars. The box set cost almost 130 dollars at some point. Right now the box set can be purchased for $90!

The main drawback to these bundles is that you do not get the fancy packaging that would be provided with the ""Knight Rider: The complete collection"" box set. The complete collection box set comes with a whimsical red bar that lights up and plays the theme song. This is actually very creative, especially if you need a large 80's showpiece for some reason. If somehow you are just looking to enjoy the episodes then you might want to consider this deal. It depends on whether or not a red flashing peice of plastic is worth $30 to you.

This bundle of the seasons will take up less space on your shelf, but as i mentioned will be less flashy. The discs that come with this set are supposed to be with 24 dvds. From reading other reviews this implies that the discs are single sided which other reviewers have noted as being a bonus. Apparently, the double sided discs had some issues when it came to consistent quality. This means you should get 12 slim cases with two discs in each case.

I feel that this is a worthwhile bundle if you love the show and you know what you are getting into.",1376006400,40,1593,4.482758620689655

2652979,4,B000I3MBNI,"Great Set exapt for the little problem that Season 3 and 4 misses some sound effects :) But I have the complete Box Set with the Scanner and Season 3 there has all sounds back in there. What also makes it nice is that ""Gimme Liberty Or Give me Death"" has the missing Song what they removed for the collectors box :) That is the reason why I bought this set :)",1366848000,,359,4.0

2653001,5,B000I3MBNI,"AWESOME SET! The quality looks great to me! I mean, it was a TV show, so I was not expecting total perfection, but my sound, color, and picture quality are excellent. I'm super happy with this set, and I'm lovin' every minute of it! I also got the Knight Rider Companion which was a great book with interviews from the cast and crew and tons of photographs.

2653015,5,B000I3MBNI,"Knight Rider is an example of what a fun comic book style action Sci-Fi series can be. Sure it can be cheesy at times but the if can also surprise you with some of the darker themes and undertones of the series that are mixed in with comedy, drama, action and suspense. Its pretty much a series anybody of any age can get lost in and enjoy.

The real fun of the show besides the action is the banter between KITT and Michael and watching them become a high tech version of a buddy cop film/show as the series progresses as well as watching what sort of crazy stunt or feat KITT will have to perform to save them and take down the villain.

Another great aspect of Knight Rider is you can pretty much count on great character actors of the 60s,70s and 80s popping up in fun roles as both victims and villains in the series. Many of whom seemed to pop up in other shows of that era playing the same sort of rolls. You're almost guaranteed to say, ""Hey I know that guy/girl!"" in pretty much every episode.",1407628800,3,1002,4.213541666666667

2653019,5,B000I3MBNI,"Knight Rider is GREAT!  I think anyone who buys this set already has an opinion on the show.  I grew up in the 80's and enjoyed it, as an adult I like to reminisce.  As for the condition of the box sets I'll be the first to say I did have a couple loose discs in the group.  And yes they were scratch from falling around during shipping.  As this is disappointing I don't think it will effect play back.  Some of the outer card board sleeves were also showing a bit of shelf wear.  Again I can look past this but it is always a little disappointing when you purchase a new item to find any wear on it.",1384819200,2,601,3.9583333333333335
2653020,4,B000I3MBNI,"I loved this show as a kid, but towards the end of the series found it got very unrealistic and bizarre.

2653051,5,B000I3MBNI,"This is a great series. The video quality seems good but I'm no expert. I will say that this is a collection of the individual seasons put together. If you already have 2 or more of the seasons, I would wait for price drop or just buy the remaining seasons. The discs can be scratched easily as they fall out of the case but as long as you're careful, this shouldn't be that big of a deal.

If you're a fan, this should be added to your collection.",1377561600,,448,4.090909090909091

That's why I gave it only 4 stars - because each disc only holds 4 episodes.  That makes for a lot of discs!

8143899,3,B000I3MBNI,This series started with a very good pilot with Richard Basehart as the dying tycoon with a purpose. After he passed away he seemed to take the series with him. This is the ultimate strange cop buddy program with a man and his computerized talking car trying to stop crime. Hasselhoff is a wooden performer who would be better as a model than an actor. Makes you want to root for the bad guys or the car.,1467331200,,404,4.259740259740259
