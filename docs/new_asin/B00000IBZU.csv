1221476,5,B00000IBZU,"I just watched this excellent dvd from the ""American Masters"" series, and couldn't be more impressed with it.  It is a real ""labor of love"", done in the style of an old Twilight Zone episode with the voice of Rod narrating a flashback through his career, using actual film clips (some from some of his very early & hard-to-find works...) as the basis of the narrative.  Marc Scott Zicree (the author of the authoritative guide to TZ) was a consultant to this project written by John F. Goff & Thomas Wagner.  These two writers manage to hit most of the major points in succinct fashion, and Serling's life makes for a compelling story -- even for the ""non-fan.""  The many famous writers and actors Rod worked with are all interviewed throughout, as well as an old archival kinetoscope of his interview with Mike Wallace of ""60 Minutes"" fame.  Also glimpsed are the commercials Serling unfortunately lowered himself to doing toward the end of his career, a choice he himself would later verbally regret.  An excellent companion to the book by Gordon Sander I used as the title of this review.

  * As a personal postscript, it should be known that I work as a video editor in the broadcast television industry.  Unfortunately, watching this documentary makes it all too evident how far television has fallen, and truly has become the ""vast wasteland"" spoke of at its birth.

** The Twilight Zone's original incarnation ran on CBS Television from 1959 - 1964.",1151193600,32,1457,4.764940239043825

1221478,5,B00000IBZU,"""Submitted for Your Approval"" is a superbly planned and executed documentary about legendary television dramatist Rod Serling (1924-1975), creator of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and of such TV plays as PATTERNS and REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT.  From the eerie, TWILIGHT ZONE-like opening sequence to the throat-catching closing one, the viewer is treated to a parade of some of the finest actors of the 1950's and 1960's who performed Serling's work, including Ed Begley, Sr., Kim Hunter, Jack Palance, Cliff Robertson, Richard Kiley, Earl Holliman, Ed and Keenan Wynn, Art Carney, and Jack Klugman.  The excerpts -- some of them lengthy -- from such episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE as ""Where Is Everybody,"" ""A Passage for Trumpet,"" ""The Eye of the Beholder,"" ""Nothing in the Dark,"" ""Walking Distance"" (considered by many to represent Serling at his peak), ""The Changing of the Guard,"" ""A Stop at Willoughby,"" and ""One for the Angels"" make one want to see those episodes in their entirety.  The documentary deftly ties the last five into Serling's own life, so one sees that ""Walking Distance"" reflected his desire to ""go home again"" and ""A Stop at Willoughby"" his weariness of the Hollywood scene; I also like how excerpts from his semi-autobiographical THE VELVET ALLEY are interspersed throughout the first part of the documentary to mirror Serling's development as a writer.  Made in 1995, ""Submitted for Your Approval"" has all the immediacy of a reality show and none of the pretentiousness.  Watching it gives one a good understanding not only of Serling but also of the era that produced him and the atmosphere in which he wrote.  Mitch Greenberg co-narrates with a dead-on imitation of Serling's clipped speech.",1104883200,5,1705,5.115107913669065
1221479,5,B00000IBZU,"This is an excellent biographical documentary about the life and works of Rod Serling. It is brilliantly constructed and edited. This well crafted presentation is a first rate production all around. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. His endearing legacy, ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form until very recently. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. I originally saw this documentary on Public Television and was pleased to find it issued on VHS.

Having received the Blu-Ray set as a gift, I was very happy to find that this DVD documentary is available separately for a pretty reasonable price.",1423526400,2,346,4.783333333333333
7910352,5,B00000IBZU,"I am a lifelong fan of ""The Twilight Zone"" and remember as a kid watching many of the episodes when they were broadcast for the first time. From that point on, I was hooked on Rod Serling's  world of imagination and the stories that sprang from his brilliant mind.

Having said that, I'm amazed at how high the price has become for the (apparently out-of-print) documentary ""Rod Serling"" Submitted for Your Approval.""  Originally, it was an episode of the ""American Masters"" series that aired on PBS years ago. Just about any Rod Serling and ""The Twilight Zone"" fan will enjoy this documentary and want to add it to his or her collection.

You can certainly purchase this documentary and pay ""collectors"" prices for it, but you also have another purchasing choice. This documentary can be found in ""The Twilight Zone: Season 5 (The Definitive Collection)"" as a bonus disc.

On Amazon, you can find ""The Twilight Zone: Season 5 (The Definitive Collection)"" used for well under $20.00 and new for around $40.00. Aside from getting this great documentary about Rod Serling's life and career, you will also get the entire fifth season of ""The Twilight Zone"" with its many classic episodes and tons of other bonus material scattered throughout the collection.",1365984000,9,1254,4.924170616113744
7910353,3,B00000IBZU,"The point is made in the American Masters episode entitled ""Rod Serling: Submitted For Your Approval"" that like many authors, this prolific teleplay creator expressed in his work things he may have obsessed over but never said out loud. Serling's memories of an idyllic childhood, his nightmares of war service and fears of an early demise (based on family history) all appear in his live TV drama scripts and especially,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TWILIGHT-ZONE/dp/B000H5U5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TWILIGHT ZONE</a>&nbsp;episodes.

Metaphorically, Rod was a creative shooting star or the proverbial candle lit at both ends. For about a decade, brilliant scripts poured from him like music out of a barrel organ, but this creative flood, the product of overwork, was eventually reduced to a trickle by comparison. Serling wrote 70 TWILIGHT ZONE scripts the first three seasons, and far fewer during the balance of the anthology's run. Despite Rod's penning of all 26 episodes for his 1965 western series THE LONER, CBS axed the show at the end of its first season.

His next series, THE NEW PEOPLE fared worse. It lasted only 17 episodes on ABC-TV. Over the course of six years (1968-74), Rod narrated 28 chapters of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-UNDERSEA-WORLD-OF-JACQUES-COUSTEAU/dp/B004JIXS2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE UNDERSEA WORLD OF JACQUES COUSTEAU</a>.  Neither of these programs are mentioned in the PBS documentary.

Serling wrote a handful of scripts for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NIGHT-GALLERY/dp/B0002CX1M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NIGHT GALLERY</a>, a supernatural NBC series he hosted (and loathed) from 1970 to '73.

Further, and more revealing is the man's belief that his many previous creations were no big deal.

The documentary is ultimately and primarily a superficial overview of TV episodes, plus highlights of a few live dramas. When called for, parallels to Serling's life in his work are pointed out, but these reveal little. ""Submitted"" never delves beneath the surface of a brilliant writer who loved being a celebrity and appearing on camera but in the end dismissed all the past glories, gave up the public persona and retreated to an upstate New York town where he enoyed the solitude of a lakefront home, taught a college course and chain-smoked himself to death by age 50.",1342915200,2,3056,7.028947368421052

7910355,5,B00000IBZU,"To Those Fascinated by the Works of Rod Serling,
  The American Masters DVD, Submitted For Your Approval, was a documentary I first saw back in the late 1990's on cable television. Whereas some documentaries just oversaw his works alone, Submitted For Your Approval gets you inside the creative process, inside the mind, of this brilliant Creator. His commentaries on the human condition rose him to prominence during the live television days and landed him in a position to go west and work in episodic television. But the medium was changing and Mr. Serling was not one to be left behind. Cleverly he adapted his messages to metaphoric science fiction and fantasy storytelling and thus Twilight Zone was the result. This documentary is told by those actors, producers, friends, and family who survived him and they relate their stories on how Mr. Serling changed with an evolving industry and later sought out those who would succeed him. Every writer, artist, musician, knows their time is finite. And so did Rod Serling. His teaching at the college level was more than just his effort to impart wisdom but also to find those who would take up his cause when he was gone. But even in death, Mr. Serling inspires Creators today and this documentary is essential to understanding that. I would recommend Submitted For Your Approval to any writer, any artist, any musician, anyone interested in creating something meaningful in their time. You are not alone. People like Rod Serling continue through their works and you are meant to do the same. Sieze that!",1281744000,2,1557,4.938931297709924
7910356,5,B00000IBZU,"For any Serling fan, this DVD is a must! Wonderful encapsulation of the brilliant writer's life and career. Snippets of various productions of his work and brief interviews with some of the stars that were blessed to have been able to take part. Also interviews with some of his relatives. One of the best parts is the opening sequence which is done just like one of the classic openings to a 'Twilight Zone' episode. In this case it refers to Rod himself and contains the same eloquent word style that became legendary. If you pay attention closely, at one point you'll discover who did the 'voice over' for the opening and that's the icing on the cake! Amen.",1253232000,3,660,4.601694915254237
7910357,2,B00000IBZU,"The operating table footage is hilarious. Not sure who came up with that idea, but anyone who felt the death of Rod Serling on an operating table was a great way to open a documentary needs to go back to school. And to think I saw this on PBS over a decade ago!

The man who narrates in Rod Serling style voice did a good job. You won't learn much from watching this documentary, sadly. It's just a summary of the teleplays Serling wrote for the networks and brief bits of dialogue from video interviews that can be found in other books.

Looking for a documentary about The Twilight Zone that does better than this documentary?

THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages and includes ""everything"" about the classic series. The details about Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. Available from Amazon.com

As a fan of Twilight Zone and owner of two dozen books on the subject, this is the first and only book I can say is the comprehensive standard so I know what I am talking about. Forget the DVD. Buy the book.",1226016000,7,1225,4.631336405529954
