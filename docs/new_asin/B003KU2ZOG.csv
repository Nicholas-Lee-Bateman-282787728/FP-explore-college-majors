8398930,4,B003KU2ZOG,"An authoritative account of USMC Ops in the PTO. This collection is for the serious student of Marine Corps history. Using file footage with voice-over narrative, it proceeds through each op from WATCHTOWER to ICEBERG. I use this to prepare my notes for classroom instruction. The entertainment value is lacking for high school/ college level students. Also, it lacks in map/graph support for mission exposition. . However its first-rate for scholarly preparation, appreciation, and reflection.",1444521600,,494,5.6
