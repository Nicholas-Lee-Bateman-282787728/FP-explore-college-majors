2155885,5,B00031TXHC,"I just recently saw this documentary for the second time in its recently released DVD version.  The Israeli and Palestinian children in Jerusalem and the West Bank that BZ Goldberg interviews, and whose lives we are given a glimpse into, are incredibly outspoken, articulate, often brutally honest and heartbreaking.  From the Israeli boy who lives in a settlement in the West Bank, to the blue-eyed Palestinian boy in east Jerusalem, we hear about their daily realities, their fears, their studies and interests, and most telling of course, their opinions on the seemingly interminable conflict that they have known about and lived through their entire lives.  The filmaker's and the movie's intent to focus on the children of the conflict does not simply pursue a cliched view that ""if only children had their way, peace could be achieved.""  Rather, the children express a full range of emotions, beliefs and ideologies (some of which evolve and change during different points in the film) towards the situation and their perceptions of ""the other""... from curiosity, to indifference, to hope for reconciliation, to anger and resentment.  Such emotions and ideologies reflect the plurality of beliefs that exist among Israeli and Palestinian populations as a whole, in large part of course, because of the way in which different parents, leaders, teachers, media sources etc. help to pass down certain values and ways of understanding the situation to the next generation.

The most touching part of the documentary is an impromptu meeting that happens between some Palestinian kids in a West Bank refugee camp and Israeli twins from Jerusalem.  Watch this documentary, if just for the scenes that unfold during this emotional, enlightening (for the kids and for us, the viewers) humorous, and bittersweet event (though I think you'll find the entire documentary to be just as great)!

This newly released DVD also includes updates on all of the main children (now teenagers), in which most of them spoke again during the summer of 2004 about where their lives have taken them since.  Some of the stories of what their lives have been like over the past 4 years, and how they have changed since the first filmings will be surprising, encouraging and perhaps sad. Whether you don't know much about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or are already very interested in it, I would recommend this documentary to you.  These kids are wise beyond their years, and some have experienced more hardship than most of us will know.  You'll learn from them, and most importantly, understand more about where they're coming from.

Maybe the best sign of how good a movie/documentary is, is whether or not the ""characters"" and ""plot"" stick with you after you've seen it.  And the stories and personalities of these children have done exactly that with me-- and will for a long time to come!",1101600000,9,2877,5.069915254237288
2155886,5,B00031TXHC,"We watched this documentary in my World Geography class - a subject I had very little interest in, until recently. I've always heard about the West Bank on the news, but never knew much about what was going on. It's about religion, right? Well, yeah... sorta. It's more about land than religion. The Palesitnians and the Jews both claim rights to it through their decendant Abraham.

This documentary is so good because it is told from the standpoint of children. Through these kids, you hear generations of hate and misunderstanding passed down through parents. Somehow, through their eyes, everything is clearer. At times you hold out hope that this can be resolved and at times, no hope whatsoever. It's funny, sad, serious and lighthearted.

After class I went home and ordered the documentary online. I intend on watching it again and showing it to friends to help them get a clear understanding of what is going on over there. I rate this documentary with Trekkies and Supersize Me. It's not as funny as the other two, but definitely worth your time and money.",1099526400,8,1066,4.819672131147541

My first order from amazon(just love the name)was of the promises project dvd and a couple of other dvd`s. I was deeply moved by this documentary. Justine Shapiro and BZ Goldberg did a cracking job on this one. THANKYOU SO MUCH. The compelling nature of this documentary as told by young children really sets things in perspective. Still young and untaunting, the children involved gives strong testimonies to what they expect and hope will become of their future. What really gets to you is that all of them seem to understand the simple fact that they one day will become grown ups and learn to ""hate"" eachother. They become friends for a short period of time while the film crew does their job, and when the documentary is done, life goes on..just like that.",1318809600,4,853,4.655629139072848

I am a broke college student. I think that this is a very inspirational story that should be passed on to many. Which is why eventually I wanted it to show younger folks & old. I feel that this story helps melt down the prejudices that we have grown up with and helps one understand that no matter how different we look and how young or old we are,We should understand that so many lives are significant in so many ways. Knowing this, it has taught me not to judge people I don't know because I don't know what life has put them through. Sometimes we all need a little break and understanding from others. I think it is a crime to take advantage of the fact that this dvd will be hard to come by and charge and arm and a leg. I thought this dvd was supposed to teach the opposite of this.

It was a great idea to make this film, dealing with the devastating conflict between Israelis and Palestinians through the eyes of those adorable little children. Those children need to be heard. They need to get to know each other. They need a chance to understand that there is a way out through understanding, sharing, tolerance, friendship, love, laughter. Justine Shapiro, BZ Goldberg and Carlos Bolado chose an extremely important subject for their movie and delivered a masterpiece in every way. This documentary is a must see. Whatever your views are about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, your heart will feel the squeeze.

2155894,5,B00031TXHC,"My daughter saw this in school and insisted we watch it.  It is a very moving though now dated, seemingly even handed documentary of the conflict.  We see this through the eyes of the next generation who will, as adults, be the ones to work on these issues.  We see how the conflict perpetuates itself in the next generation.  I found it very moving and curious to explore certain issues at the end of the film regarding the boundaries of the connections (I don't want to reveal too much).
I hope  the filmmaker is working on or planning a continuation....much like Michael Apted's work, this would be an interesting area for periodic follow ups with the same group of very articulate and thoughtful youth on both sides.",1211328000,,720,4.637795275590551

2155899,5,B00031TXHC,"If you have ever wondered how to gain at least some understanding of the convoluted, protracted and intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, watch this documentary film. You will learn its basic history, but perhaps more importantly you will learn about the deeply human impulses that drive that history, human impulses as they are experienced and narrated by seven children interviewed for this film project--Israeli and Palestinian, extremist and conciliatory, passive observers and political militants, boys and girls. A child's perspective, it turns out, touches the viewer very deeply, for these kids have siblings who have been killed and parents jailed without formal charges. In an especially moving sequence, the children meet together in an exchange of food, games, friendship, opinions, tears, and feelings of both hope and futility. The final frames show an Arab mother and a Jewish father in a maternity ward standing next to each other, each embracing their newborn baby. The producers edited over 170 hours of original interviews down to 107 minutes for this incredible film. In Arabic, Hebrew, and English, with English subtitles.",1169596800,5,1147,5.5227272727272725
2155900,5,B00031TXHC,"This film has the most balanced view that I have yet seen on the Palestinian/Israli conflict. Now if the same thing could only be done with adults as the main characters as well! There were a couple hard-nosed,close-minded ""jerks"" on both sides who had no interest in meeting,but I really came to love ""all"" the kids, Palestinian and Jew, who were interested and willing to meet. I got choked up and teary-eyed several times while watching. It is sad,sweet,and incredibly well done. It really grabs you from the start and you really get to know and like  the main characters,and dislike the jerks! So you get to see good-hearted kids from both sides,and also the extremists from both sides.

I was shocked in watching this, and ""Death In Gaza"", how ""slummy"" the Palestinian areas are! I must admit after reading The U.S. is the single largest non-Muslim contributor of assistance to the Palestinian people, a fact not widely known.  The U.S. has been giving an average of about $85 million per year in foreign aid to the Palestinians since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Most of the aid has been channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to contractors and private voluntary organizations. (Outside of regular foreign aid, the U.S. has provided funds to the United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) since 1950 and is also the largest donor to this U.N. program for Palestinian refugees.)On top of all the other foreign-aid they get from other donors,that they live in such slums!

I can't help but wonder what they do with all that money? I mean they don't have to worry about suicide bombers coming into their areas,so why don't they clean the place up,for pity's sake?

I cannot help but feel they do not HAVE to live in such conditions. The absolute,complete lack of any evidence of anyone even trying to improve their living conditions,really struck me. It was just so glaringly obvious,that those thoughts would just not be silenced while I watched.

It seems they are chronic complainers who can only blame others for their plight,rather than even attempt to improve things for themselves. They have lived in those slums for how long now? My city has projects complexes that have residents who at least clean up around the places and plant flowers and they look ""upscale"" compared to what I have seen of Palestine! And they don't even get money handed to them to help,either.

 So this film raised some questions for me,but it really is a great film,and the DVD extras were wonderful as well,such as the updates on the kids. One could only wish that every Arab and Israli would see it. I ended up agreeing with points from both sides! However,one can't miss that the Palestinians have no desire for a seperate Palestinian state,they just want all of Israel back!",1166745600,3,2813,4.821576763485477
2155901,5,B00031TXHC,"What keeps hate and mistrust alive?  Planting those seeds in the minds of children.  What can diffuse hate and mistrust?  Teaching children to see things from another's point of view.  These seem to be (a few of) the lessons in Promises.  Shocking in the movie is the amount of dogma absorbed, understood and regurgitated by (preteen) Jewish and Arab children (from Israel and the occupied territories.)  Promises is an eye-opener in that it shows how real people - in this case, children - view the ""enemy"" in a conflict that has raged for decades (some would say millenia.)

Promises seems to have a bit of a Pro-Palestinian slant.  There again, both points of view, for lack of a better term, are represented through the thoughts and feelings of the kids interviewed.  Though sometimes terrifying how filled with mistrust - the beginnings of hate starting to creep to the surface - both the Jewish and Arab children seem to be, Promises is life-affirming in that glimpses of hope are seen as the children meet and interact with each other.

It's a great film.  I wish someone had done a movie like this about kids in Northern Ireland.",1166745600,5,1137,4.75
2155902,5,B00031TXHC,"The currency of life is hope, and this gorgeous little documentary delivers it in spades. With one proviso (below), I highly recommend this film - it will leave you with a tear and a smile. Glorious especially for its ability to tug at the heartstrings.

Of course, documentaries don't pretend to be unbiased. That's not the point of this film. The point is to inspire hope. However, the filmmakers here are very sympathetic to the Palestinian position and, perhaps because they assume that the extent of the terror against Israel is widely known, they don't linger on Israeli suffering in the conflict - which got to the point of multiple suicide bombings per day at the very height of the post-Oslo war.

The result is a film that is less interested in a fair representation of political reality than in emotion, emphasizing Palestinian suffering and edging on caricaturising Israeli suffering (through an unrepresentative sample of Israeli children, particularly the oafish religious settler boy).

Nevertheless - watch the film. It's gold.",1163030400,6,1043,5.123529411764705
2155903,5,B00031TXHC,"I first saw PROMISES when it first appeared - belatedly - on DVD in 2004, and purchased a copy shortly thereafter.  It is without a doubt the finest documentary of recent years; I'm forever shocked that it didn't win the Oscar it was nominated for.

Documentarians Justine Shapiro, Carlos Bolado and B.Z. Goldberg (Goldberg grew up in Israel) travel to Israel and the West Bank, in the hopes of gleaning some new perspectives on the grueling and seeimingly intractable divisions between Israel and the Palestinian people.  PROMISES - the result - is built around a lengthy series of interviews with children, both Israeli and Palestinian, in which the filmmakers seek to discover their opinions on the conflict and their hopes for solutions, capturing a very vivid slice-of-life on both sides of the fences and checkpoints in the process.

The results are complex, immensely moving filmmaking.  The varied children have approriated any number of their parents prejudices, but over the course of the film those prejudices (and prejudice in general) shows itself to be refreshingly transitory if (AND ONLY IF) the individual in question can also carry some sense of hope, whether for a better world, or a better personal future.  And not a single one of the children seen onscreen here has given up on anything; and a great flexibility in thought reveals itself by the films' end.

This could be written off as a side effect of maturity; and a child's growing sense of world-awareness (these kids are all pretty much adults by the end of the DVD supplements, which are very critical viewing, and not expendable extras), but implicit throughout PROMISES is that adults can also learn a few things here: there's a time to dig in and stand your ground, and then there are also times when one should have a civil discussion and listen to what opponents actually have to say, or what opponents actually feel.

Ultimately, PROMISES doesn't - can't answer all of the questions surrounding the ongoing crises surrounding Isreal and the occupied territories.  But it does introduce elements of hope, in a discussion that usually has none.

2155904,4,B00031TXHC,"If anything, this movie left me even more pessimistic for the future of a possible Palestinian state. While the children talk incessantly of building a new Palestinian home, they also carry the expectations of returning to their former homes in Israel, seemingly oblivious that the creation of a Palestinian homeland involves living in it, not Israel.

Much of the later dialog of the Palestinian children in the movie centers around their  unshakable attachment towards their aggrieved status as disenfranchised refugees. They convey little sense of desire to move on towards a new future in a separate Palestinian state, and to accept that they must bury the keys to the homes that once belonged to their grandparents on what is now, and will almost certainly remain, Israeli soil.

The movie would also have been more accurate -- even if less powerful -- had the narrator touched on the extent to which other Arab nations created the Palestinian refugee problem, rather than presenting it as a strictly Jewish vs. Arabic conflict.

While the film discusses the creation of refugee camps from Arabs fleeing Israel in 1948, it never mentions the equal number of Jews who were made refugees (with their property confiscated) by Arab nations in retribution --- or how their fellow Jews sacrificed to bring them new homes, job training, and to move on to a new life -- whereas the Arab nations built refugee camps for their displaced brethren.

In that light, the implied argument of the filmmakers that the Arab refugee problem was created by the Jews does not especially hold weight.

Furthermore, at no point does it mention that the Palestine existing prior to the creation of Israel was, in fact, instead occupied by the Turks, and after that, the British. Instead, it deceptively leads the viewer to believe that Israel built its nation on the back of some sort of formerly existing Palestinian nation.

This is still a powerful film. Be sure to watch the bonus material on the DVD, recorded years later.",1151107200,11,2008,4.958333333333333

2155907,5,B00031TXHC,"Both documentaries have had a profound impact on me. I saw Gaza before this, and I like that order even though they were filmed in reverse. The film showed how the childish optimism slowly peeled away over the years, though hope seemed to fall away with it.

To those who say it is Palistinian biased, I think the plight is worse for Palistinian children. That may be where the bias seems to come from. Children were the lens both documentaries were filmed through, which is why I compare them. In promises, you see some examples of what different children's lives are like on both sides of the struggle. Some hesitantly choose to meet face to face near the end. With so little interaction, and so much mutual ill will, its no wonder progress is seldom made.",1134345600,6,758,4.573529411764706

I saw it at our synagogue one night, and I fail to see what they claim. ""Promises"" is not anti-Jewish nor pro-Palestinian: it is pro-humanity! It shows just how prejudiced both communities are, and how the poison of hate filters down to the children. If it is 'anti' anything, it is anti- hate, anti- bigotry, and pro- know-your-neighbor-as-yourself. There are several deeply profound moments in the film that can just blow you away (if your heart is open to it). The film demonstrates to the viewer the healing power of listening and being heard, and the wonderful natural ability of children to quickly 'see outside of the box', or in this case, see each other beyond what they've been taught: that the other is an 'enemy' to be distrusted. Instead, they readily can see that, in fact, they are much alike. They love the things that all children love. And, in the alchemy of one special moment, they have the vision (that most adults woefully lack) to imagine a life where they could live together, and even enjoy each other! Like one of the other reviewers, if there were more stars to give this film, I would not limit it to 5 stars. I wish all Palestinians and Israelis, Jews and Arabs, would see this wonderful film.

2155909,5,B00031TXHC,"I have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. A beautiful and deeply moving portrait of seven Palestinian and Israeli children.

  This film focuses on the lives of these incredibly talented and intellegent children and the world that seperates them. Seperated by just a few miles and a chain link fence, these beautiful children are completely cut off by war, prejudice and hatred.

  Most of the children had lost family members to the other side. ""The enemy"". Many were children themselves when they were killed.

  One of the children makes a statement during an interview that completely moved me. ""Who wins in war? Either you die, or your enemy dies, but either way, who has really won?""

  So often in the American news we hear of the horrible bombings in Israel. The acts of Arabic terrorists. I always thought of the Israelis being the only victims. Rarely do we ever hear of the oppression and killings of the Palestinians. The loss of their land due to colonialism. I never knew how much these Arabs suffered. I don't feel this film was biased at all as one reviewer states. These are all opinions of children, most of them very differing. There is no slant, just interviews with the children.

2155910,3,B00031TXHC,"Filmaker Goldberg interviews several Israeli and Palestinian children from the late nineties up until the start of the second intifada.  The movie often shows how the Israeli government influences life for the Palestinians, yet does not show why certain precautions, such as checkpoints, take place.  We see a young girl waiting on line for hours to see her jailed father.  Well, that may hit some on a purely emotional level, but what did that father do to land himself in jail?  That is not explored in this movie.  Goldberg presents the Palestinians as being helpless people who only have rocks to defend themselves, but how does a bus blow up with a rock?  The filmaker shows a picture of a child killed by Israeli soldiers, but where are the pictures of young Moshe's friend who was killed in a terrorist attack?

In all, I feel that the movie is entertaining and gives a human face to the people involved in the world events we so often read about in the papers, but would be better if the filmaker didn't show the Palestinians as being justified for terrorizing a whole society.

The movie gave me a much better understanding about the Israeli-Palastinean conflit and the people behind it. I think it's because that the main characters are children which makes the movie so compelling and moving. It was also amazing how much the children understood--they knew their positions well and defended with logic based on who they where, what they are taught, and just... everything that they are.

We're going to meet that Arab kid in the film, Faraj, in our class soon, and I'm really excited! He, I think, understood the conflict best of all, and has a much much more objective and well-analyzed viewpoint. He may be an Arab, and he shows anger and intolerance to begin with, but as he progresses in the film, he realizes that Jewish children are just like Arab children. He wants to meet and connect, yet he knows that it takes a lot of work because there is little to connect these children. He is also interested in the conflict, and isn't just worried about his own problems like one of the kids... something about volleyball.

Anyway, whatever your view may be, this view is definitely an eye-opener. I cried a couple times because it's just such a wonderful movie!!",1111449600,6,1341,4.775862068965517

The gripping and at times hard to watch story is told through the eyes of a group of Israeli and Arab children. Innocent yet old beyond their years due to be raised and living in worn torn times. Two sides of a very complex and heartbreaking reality. B.Z Goldberg directs from in front of the camera with emotional brevity. The two standout subjects, twins, Yarko and Daniel act as a sort of Greek Chorus, unwilling and somewhat resistant secular jews who want understand their harsh reality but want to be kids. As the troubling story moves towards the final act, I found myself overcome again and again, crying and then sobbing right along with the children. Promises is simply astounding. I wanted to get on the phone and call each of those kids and tell them ""it's going to all be ok""",1492214400,,857,4.682119205298013

8035918,1,B00031TXHC,"Filmaker Goldberg interviews several Israeli and Palestinian children from the late nineties up until the start of the second intifada. The movie often shows how the Israeli government influences life for the Palestinians, yet does not show why certain precautions, such as checkpoints, take place. We see a young girl waiting on line for hours to see her jailed father. Well, that may hit some on a purely emotional level, but what did that father do to land himself in jail? That is not explored in this movie. Goldberg presents the Palestinians as being helpless people who only have rocks to defend themselves, but how does a bus blow up with a rock (Hint: It doesn't)? The filmaker shows a picture of a child killed by Israeli soldiers, but where are the pictures of young Moshe's friend who was killed in a terrorist attack?

In all, I feel that the movie gives a human face to the people involved in the world events we so often read about in the papers, but would be better if the filmaker didn't attempt to evoke sympathy for Palestinians as if they are justified in terrorizing a whole society. A very Anti-Israel film which is VERY critical of Israel's history in the past sixty plus years and the current government.

One out of five stars, for an obviously biased extreme left-wing propaganda film.",1335830400,10,1311,4.720524017467249
