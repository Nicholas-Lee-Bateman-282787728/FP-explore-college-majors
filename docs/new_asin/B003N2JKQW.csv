8400615,3,B003N2JKQW,"This does not appear to be formatted to older ordinary tv's, but to the wide screen types so some of the dialogue screens cut off the extreems on the wording...but it's usualy descipherable. The contrast is good so you're not looking at ghosts. But it's a bit dark overall and you might need to adjust your tv to the brighter side. It took several attempts to load on my cheap player.
It became apparent this was a contemporary western...of sorts when 6 follies chicks in flappery types styles and bathing suits showed up. I wondered if any automobiles would appear and confirm this. One did, and it became part of the story...an automobile chacing a horse!
At the beggining there was some 'canned laughter' which made no sence. The music was acceptable and not distracting.
The editing is probably the best part, as the story is easy to follow. The wonder horse ""Tarzan"" was a bit of a stretch...more silly than plausible.
There were a few twists and turns and just when you thought the movie was ending, a whole new kettle of fish is gone into. With a bonus feature mentioned you don't know exactly when the movies is going to end either, which in my mind was a brilliant stroke.
The story is sort of average, with typical romantic interest always going south for some reason or another. With the right screen and brightness this would be more enjoyable.
There are interesting dam being built in progress pictures, and some period attitudes towards blacks, but fairly innocent. There were some attemps at humour which seem to fall flat on me. Not a classic, but I've seen worse.
the bonus feature, though short, was a curious bit of period sillyness from 1934...a nice break after the movie.",1358294400,,1693,4.684563758389261
8400616,3,B003N2JKQW,"This 5-reel feature is one four surviving examples from the six Westerns released by the Davis Distributing Division during 1925-26 and starring newcomer, Ken Maynard, along with Tarzan, his ""wonder horse.""  $50,000 Reward is essentially a chase movie in which the bad guys pursued Ken to get their hands upon a deed to land about to become valuable because of a dam being built. Esther Ralston played the daughter of the dam's engineer and provided the romantic interest, whilst the group of bathing beauties who appeared as eye candy throughout this series are again present.

 The significance of this movie (like the other entries in the low budget series) is that all of the characteristic features of a Ken Maynard Western are present: A brawl in which Ken fights off a saloon full of henchmen; a rooftop chase; some fine riding over rough country; transfers from horse to horse; Ken's horse, Tarzan, freeing him from his bonds; a high altitude fight on top of the damn, and some Roman riding on the buckboard team before Ken rescues the girl. In other words, whatever improvements in budgets, locations and producing, directing or writing expertise may have subsequently been added by First National, Universal, or Columbia, it is demonstrated here that the originator of the basic formula repeated in all Ken Maynard Westerns through to 1944 was  - Ken Maynard.",1347840000,2,1369,4.991228070175438
