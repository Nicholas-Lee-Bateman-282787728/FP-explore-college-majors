I didn't recall that Burt Bacharach sings the first half of his duet with Dusty on ""A House is not a Home,"" and she muffs one word. But she hits every note beautifully, and I'll re-watch it often, I am sure.",1290211200,,331,4.1875

Of the four artists profiles (which also include Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Small Faces and Herman's Hermits), Dusty Springfield made perhaps the largest artistic impact on America. Herman's Hermits had more hits, and the Small Faces were a bigger influence on the mod movement in the UK, but Springfield's key works, ""I Only Want to Be With You,"" Bacharach & David's ""Wishin' and Hopin',"" ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,"" and especially ""Son of a Preacher Man"" harbored a soulfulness that none of her UK peers could match. She exuded class in her demure, self-contained dance moves, elegant frilled blouses and long skirts.

As with many pop stars of the era, Springfield's television appearances mixed lip-synching and live performances. Unlike most others, though, her lip-synching was truly expressive. While others simply mimed their vocals, Springfield acted them out with her movements, doing with her body and face what she'd already done with her voice in the studio. Better yet, she was a great live singer, as evidenced by a terrific 1965 performance of ""All Cried Out"" on the Ed Sullivan show and 1966 NME poll winner's performances of ""In the Middle of Nowhere"" and ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me."" She exhorts the crowd while singing covers of Betty Everett's ""I Can't Hear You"" and Otis Redding's ""Shake,"" and without a monitor speaker in sight, delivers pitch-perfect vocals.

Springfield had greater chart success in the UK than the US, but even songs that failed to conquer the states, such as ""Some of Your Lovin'"" and Bacharach and David's ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,"" were strong enough to lodge in the ears of American fans. Even her lower-charting US hits, such as ""Stay Awhile"" (perfectly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/covered-in-1978/dp/B001M19106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">covered in 1978</a>&nbsp;by Rachel Sweet) remain familiar. In 1968 Springfield took her singing to a new level with the sessions that resulted in the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dusty-in-Memphis/dp/B00000HZEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dusty in Memphis</a>&nbsp;and the single ""Son of a Preacher Man."" Amid players and producers whose music had provided the template for her own recordings, she sang with a reserve that spoke to her underlying strength rather than the explicit power she could unleash. Her gospel phrasings and confessional tone gave the hit an intimacy with which listeners connected on a deep, emotional level. Amazingly, the single only reached #10 and became her last hit until a 1987 teaming with the Pet Shop Boys on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Have-I-Done-to-Deserve-This/dp/B0017ZK21O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Have I Done to Deserve This?</a>""

This 69-minute documentary includes sixteen performances, each of which (and four more) can be seen in full in the DVD's extras. There's also a 24-page booklet that's stuffed with liner notes by Annie Randall, photos, ephemera and credits. Period interview clips with Springfield from 1964, 1971 and 1978 and contemporary interviews with two of her backup singers (Madeline Bell and Simon Bell) and Burt Bacharach provide interesting personal reflections. The details of Springfield's anti-apartheid contract clause (for shows in South Africa) are particularly enlightening. The performances are terrific, but, in the end, the documentary doesn't tell enough of Springfield's story, and fails to explain (as the liner notes do) why her commercial success faded at the end of the `60s. This is worth seeing, particularly for fans, but if you're interested more generally in the British Invasion, the volumes on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Small-Faces/dp/B0034BBB2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Small Faces</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Herman-s-Hermits/dp/B0034BBB1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Herman's Hermits</a>&nbsp;are better documentaries.

4066797,5,B0034BBB1E,"Dusty Springfield could tremble the Theatre stage and then tear up the Soul club. She was the nexus point from the torch singers and Jazz songbirds before her into the hip new 60's world of Mod Soul, breezy Samba, and slinky Lounge. We're still catching up to her.

Here's a great place to start. See all of her faces in this killer collection of filmed performances. She's sauntering from jump with the opener ""I Only Want To Be With You"" and on into minor classics ""Once Upon A time"" and ""All Cried Out"" with enough sass and vigor to give Phil Spector pause. Watch her steal the NME awards show from The Beatles kicking it funky with Otis Redding's ""Shake"", in tight ankle skirt and heels, no less. Soul to the bone, opening the door from Annie Lennox to Amy Winehouse after.

But also the grande diva of drama. Dusty led the battalion of Britgirls (see ""Dream Babes"" CD series) who belted out epic Soul-Pop arias with intense symphonic punch. Ballads like ""I Close My Eyes And Count To Ten"" and ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"" became an emotional cinemascope, somewhere between Roy Orbison's hymns and John Barry's scores. This theatrical moodscape paved the way for Julee Cruise, Bjork, Portishead, Hooverphonic, and Morcheeba later.

Most know her for ""Son Of A Preacher Man"" from the album ""Dusty In Memphis"" (the expanded CD with double the songs, from Rhino, is one of the most essential discs you could own).  Dusty found another side of herself when her nervousness at recording at Stax led to a more breathy intimacy. She gained a smokey suppleness, turning each song into a honey-whispered confession. Shelby Lynne, Cat Power, Keren Ann, and Saint Etienne continue from this.

With insightful commentary by Burt Bacharach and back-up singers Madeline Bell and Simon Bell, archive interviews with Dusty, great songs and better singing, this disc is a must!",1272153600,12,1878,4.801857585139319
4066798,5,B0034BBB1E,"A lot of great music is included on this 84 minute DVD. It starts with Dusty Springfield's rendition of I ONLY WANT TO BE WITH YOU, from 1964, and ends with A BRAND NEW ME, in 1969. Brief, informative interviews with Dusty and people who worked with her, such as Burt Bacharach, are woven into the program. What is unique about this presentation is that not a single interview interferes with any of her performances. Once the music starts, and Dusty begins to sing, you have the pleasure of seeing and hearing a full, uninterupted performance.

Several of her earliest performances are taken from TV shows done in Europe, Australia, and the USA - there are a couple of fine ones from The Ed Sullivan Show. For me, the highlights of the disc are when she performs at the NME Poll Winner's Concerts filmed in England in 1965 & 1966. In this arena sized venue, she has the opportunity to show her enormous talent before large, live audiences. She really gets to strut her stuff and when she does YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME, she hits it out of the park.

Actually, there are two ways to watch the DVD. The second is to head to the Bonus Features section for ""The Complete Performances"" which excludes all the interviews and only plays her performances. Four other songs are shuffled into the ones included in the original presentation. They are DANCING IN THE STREET, MOCKIBGBIRD,(both recorded at NME Poll Winner's Concerts), MY COLOURING BOOK, and ends with A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME(a duet with Burt Bacharach). After first seeing the original version, most people will probably prefer going straight to this music only option.

For the most part, the picture and sound is sharp. Much better than I expected. After all, these were filmed in the 60's, so some of them show some wear & tear - not enough to really detract from the performances, however.

If you are a Dusty Springfield fan, pick up a copy of this DVD. You're going to play it alot!",1270339200,26,1949,4.5759312320916905

8388336,5,B0034BBB1E,"I have used the term Essential Music Document before and I don't use it unless it is warranted and believe me I am sincere.
This is a wonderful documentary for the genius of Dusty Springfield, the best I have found so far but I am still looking and always will!
Audio quality is excellent for the most part, offered in 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo.
Video quality is a bit lacking for some performances, further restoration is needed. Puzzling. There is nothing more worthy of restoring than Performance Art and this is some of the absolute best.
Dusty had an amazing career and I honestly don't think any documentary can capture the scope of it. Her artistic achievements are Her own and Her influence is everlasting.
We were fortunate enough to have David Bowie, Michael Jackson and Prince for a while and we still have Annie Lennox, Morrissey and Sade.
But will there ever be another Dusty Springfield? No. She is unsurpassed.
This is a fascinating DVD, very worthwhile.
It was professionally produced with the best intentions.
I also strongly recommend the Dusty Springfield Reflections DVD and the Simply Dusty CD compilation, approved by Dusty herself.
This is one of my favorite purchases.
I love it!

8388342,5,B0034BBB1E,"There was simply no vocalist alive, then or now, who could hold a candle to Dusty Springfield.  Her voice, phrasing and styling were superb.  I've never heard her sing a bad note...even after her problems with drugs and treatments for Cancer ravaged her to some extent that incredible voice was still there.  This compilation of clips from her TV shows as well as appearances on stage and on American Television, along with the narratives from her back-up singers and various professional entities, gives us some insight into this Irish lass with the incredible and uncanny voice.  Dusty was THE British Invasion before anyone knew there was going to be one!  She truly had no equal and the list of song titles will take you back to a time when music was truly wonderful and pure talent was the criteria!  Today, a device called ""Auto-Tune"" practically rules the recording industry. That was not so in Dusty's day...and she didn't need it anyway.  There simply was no need to correct pitch or tone and she didn't require special effects to enhance her vocals.  She was perfect every time she performed.  Audiences adored her, performers champed at the bit to sing with her and she was revered by the industry she ruled.  This DVD is a sure winner.",1434067200,2,1247,4.758139534883721
