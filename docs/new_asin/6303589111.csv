684066,4,6303589111,"Anything with Valerie Harper deserves at least 4 stars.  I have seen this film, and while she looks terrible, her inner beauty and generosity of  spirit are considerable.  However, this is Marhsa Mason's film.  She has  even enough charm and energy to arouse shaggy dog James Caan.  Still, this  is a well-cast film---Caan's character, Neil Simon himself, a writer,  should be an oddball.  If you like or love The Goodbye Girl, you will find  Chapter Two to be compatibly good.",967075200,3,477,4.85
684067,5,6303589111,"This film is wonderful, especially for the romantic movie buff who enjoys a measure of comedy in connection with very serious issues.  Chapter 2 is set in the mid to late 70s in New York City.  The casting producer chose  wisely, Marsha Mason is the personification of the 1970s divorced woman.  Valerie Harper (physically breathtaking in this movie) plays her neurotic  best friend trying to lend emotional support  while managing her own very  unhappy existance and Joe Bologna (unhappily married press agent) and James  Caan (Marsha Mason's co-star and widower)play two brothers deeply involved  in one another's lives.  Caan and Mason fall in love thanks to Bologna and  Harper's match making, but decide to marry before Caan has fully come to  terms with his wife's recent death.  It's a happy ending but what happens  in between the silly antics of Bologna and Harper and the truly touching  ending may make even the most unemotional person emotional.  Almost anyone  will appreciate the touching way in which this story was told - watch and  enjoy!",952732800,14,1055,5.0
684068,5,6303589111,"I have seen this movie many times, and will probably watch it many more.  It is a great story, and knowing that it is based after Neil Simon and Marsh Mason's own story makes it even better. It makes me happy and sad and  happy again. I usually cry. When I cry that is a good movie!",940723200,4,282,3.9298245614035086
684069,5,6303589111,Chapter Two is a sweet story. You are so happy that the things turn out for the best.  I love the way Marsha Mason fights James Caan to make him understand that even though they rushed into their romance. Love will  always mend a broken heart.,930268800,3,243,4.260869565217392
684070,4,6303589111,"Professional therapists would benefit from a viewing of this emotions/communications conflict.  The characters struggle through the emotions of love, grief and loss and the ensuing identity crises in which  they find themselves.  Many female clients (and a few men), unable to write  their own affirmation statements have been able to take Marsha Mason's  monologue in the closing moments to inspire and motivate them in the  capturing of their own identity and self-worth. And therapy issues aside,  this is a wonderful classic.  Out of print and distribution for several  years, it's worth adding to most video collections.",919123200,,625,5.427083333333333
684141,5,6303589111,"Playwright Neil Simon saved some of his best writing for this snappy romantic escapade, possibly because his then-wife Marsha Mason filled the lead female role with a bravo performance. Co-star James Caan had the difficult task of sustaining audience appeal through a lengthy period of remorse over the death of his first wife. But his first-half performance is a winner, with sparkling wit and charm. I had enjoyed the original theatrical release of this movie years ago, and i fulfilled an urge to watch it again on this recent DVD. I'm glad I did.",1483142400,2,550,4.861702127659575

Lost in the world until he met Marsha Mason in her best role to date. This movie is a slice of upper west side New York life in the 80's. Director Robert Moore and writer Neil Simon are at the top of their games. A stunning Valerie Haper and Joseph Bologna fill out the cast.

684381,5,6303589111,"Chapter Two is a personal and in depth look at the lives of two individuals who have achieved success and are reasonably comfortable in life but who are missing a personal, emotional, and physical connection to the opposite sex which they secretly desire but are reluctant to pursue. James Caan plays George Schneider, a successful author of books, whose wife died within the past year and who went on a world tour, trying to forget his grief but which in fact brought it all the more to the forefront. Jenny McCleod played to perfection by Marsha Mason is a working actress whose best friend Faye wants her friend to find love and romance in her life. George's  brother Leo (played by Joe Bologna) meets Jenny through Faye and believes Jenny would be the perfect date for George. The scene is set for matchmaking which works out much better than either Faye or Leo envisioned or anticipated: a whirlwind romance and marriage within a twenty two day period. As one might surmise, problems arose in the not too distant future and most of the film is devoted to a serious exploration of their emotions, expectations from marriage, and the past events which led to their sudden marriage and the emotional upheavals which accompanied it. Both Marsha Mason and James Caan are perfectly cast in their roles, stretching their acting abilities and skills to producing unforgettable characters.

Since George and Marsha are in their early forties, the thought of dating again makes them extremely anxious. However, totally by chance, they  engage in conversation on the telephone for a much longer time than either one intended or expected when  George mixes up his notes with phone numbers and reaches Jenny by mistake. He is intrigued by her responses with their innuendos and double entends while joking. George hangs up, thinks about what Jenny said and calls back several times, each recognizing an interest in the other, and a growing connection they want to pursue. They find each other especially intriguing when the recognition arises that they are speaking to the very person their best friends wanted to introduce to the other.

Especially poignant scenes arise on their honeymoon in what looks like Bermuda, where they stay at an ocean front cottage. The viewer anticipates trouble when learning that George and his deceased wife used to visit there in the past. One can only question their judgement as to why they even selected this location for the start of their presumed marital bliss, when any sane person would avoid it recognizing it could release a flood of emotions. It does indeed cause George to become cold and distant from Jenny. Jenny questions herself and her own desires, needs, while they are growing apart. After returning to New York, they agree to live in George's home. George withdraws and Jenny is sent adrift in her sadness. George takes a trip to California to confront himself and his feelings, leaving Jenny to wonder about the state of her marriage. When she goes to visit her home, she discovers Leo and Faye are using it for an affair. George returns and admits his true feelings to Jenny as they each realize the vulnerability and needs of the other and also recognize the strength of their feelings and resolve to build a new life together. This film is definitely long and intense, due to the subject matter it could not be anything else. I found it very engaging and became vested in wanting both characters to understand each other's emotions and work through their problems. I can understand how some people would find the film tedious and too personally dramatic. While some of the film is light-hearted comedy most of the film consists of dramatic, emotionally intense moments and conversations related to processing personal issues and needs. People who love conflict resolution will love this film. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1424217600,,3871,4.930981595092025

Unfortunately films like this are lacking today.  I honestly do not think the talent is there and the almighty dollar comes first.  back in the 40s, 50s, 60s,70s and even into the 80s film makers had a passion that is missing today.  I laugh when I hear about movies that have grossed $75 million over the weekend.....it isn't because there filling theatre seats its because of overly high ticket prices.

Marsha Mason is the glue in this film....what a well deserved Oscar nominated performance  (I believe she was nominated 5 times over her film career).

684688,4,6303589111,"In an era when Neil Simon could get his ""laundry list published"" (I stole that from Stephen King), this movie still managed to fly under the radar. Maybe it got eclipsed by ""The Goodbye Girl"", I don't know. In any case, this is a very enjoyable rom-com, with Simon's trademark banter. I don't think that either James Caan or Marsh Mason were stretching their acting chops here, but this is still a very enjoyable take. I was interested to learn that this is basically the story of Simon's marriage to Mason, after the death of his first wife. It must have been , ummm, challenging for him to write, and for her to play.

In any case, as a movie that never really made it big, the DVD has no extras to offer. That's okay, all I wanted was to be able to see this again. With two solid principals, and a supporting cast of Valerie Harper and Joe Bologna, this is definitely worth checking out. I had no issues at all with the transfer from VHS to DVD (something I had been contemplating doing myself, just to be able to see this again).

Marsha Mason is just wonderful and James Caan delivers a great performance in this rather light romance, but it is based on painful realities from Neil Simon and Marsha's personal past experiences.

684745,5,6303589111,"I really do love this movie. The topic is depressing--husband loses wife he adores--but Neil Simon made heartbreaking material so entertaining. James Caan is great--low key, repressing his emotions, stoic. Marsha Mason is good too--her speech at the end about how she is nuts about herself should be required viewing for every female with self-esteem issues. Joseph Bologna is fantastic--funny, sarcastic, believable. The only character I didn't like was Valerie Harper--too thin and her hair looked extremely weird--like she'd soaked it in water and then let it floof out to a strange texture and color. Although I personally think George and Jenny got married way too fast, this is still a terrific movie.",1361491200,,707,5.265486725663717

James Cahn and Marsha Mason are wonderful in their roles. The rest of the cast are equally as good. Great story line. Cute movie  containing happy moments and some sad. All-in-all it's an excellent movie to watch, and I would recommend ""Chapter Two"" highly. Neil Simon did it again with this movie, and I believe this was also based on his play of same title.

The quality of the video is more like that one finds on VHS tape, but we are not expecting a modern DVD with all the extra stuff, and HD quality anyway.

Marsha Mason's portrayal of Jenny was heart-felt and realistic especially for the scene where she stands up for herself as James Caan's character prepares to leave.  Valerie Harper was enjoyable as best friend to Jenny.  The scenes of their honeymoon were actually filmed in Bermuda not the West Indies as James Caan's character gave directions to the cab driver taking them to the airport.  I lived in Bermuda for many wonderful years, and it was filmed beautifully and true.

684998,5,6303589111,"Now at the age of 68 I have time to reflect from my past.  I'm in the processe of writing five books simultaneously, which I'm finding quite a joyful event.

I purposely looked up when this movie was made because it has remained a wonderfful adventure of love's second time around.  I also married twice and found that the second time holds a higher appreciation of emotions but on the flip side of the coin, it also comes with a price.  I was amazed at seeing this movie again after so many years, to find that the romance I remembered was now a little more shallow in the beginning, and  lasted through many twists and turns, to come out so rewarding to see that it is possible to fall in love again, if you can find that person who compliments your depth of learning about your rights and wrongs in a relationship.  We each have that common scale we build as we travel through life.

What brought me to review Marsha Mason was her appearance on the Frazier citcoms that I watch every night for a half hour or so, so enable me to calm down and turn the busy world of today, so I can go to sleeps each night with a light heart and open to good dreams.

So I truly recommend this book for all ages, 12 and up, as an advance possibility of love to look forward to, or toward the end of our adventureous life on earth, to see is we were forunately blessed with any kind of love like this, in our travels.

I can truly say, my second marriage I had it all at one time in my life.  If I never marry again, which GOD has left me single for over 32 years now, at at least had it once... which I have found throughout the years, allot of people never find it once.  That's sad to my heart.

Hopefully, this review will give you a desire to seek out this movie, it's really worth it... wholesome, real, relative.

Have a blessed day!

I have some old VCR tapes, and they play fine, so I am certain the player is not the problem. I would not have expected this from a new, sealed tape, made in 1995, but maybe that is to be expected.
