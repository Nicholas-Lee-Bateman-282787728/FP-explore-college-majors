It is said certain things do not age well if this is so then add Medical Practice and Medical Standards of care to the list.  These Medic DVD's are of acceptable but not first rate quality.  the video and audio together make many of the episodes watchable but in some cases only just so.

The 1950's were a different age from anything we know now.  I was a child of the 1960's as such things were already starting to be a bit unhinged as I grew into adulthood during the 1970's.  Medic fascinates me because; the people in Medic seem almost unreal given how mainstream and correct everyone else seems.  I used to hear the hippies and flower children talk about ""THE ESTABLISHMENT"" and I always wondered what exactly were they talking about,  I watch Medic and I can see ""THE ESTABLISHMENT"" for myself.

I think these MEDIC TV shows serve as awesome teaching tools to introduce children to the culture of the 1950's when viewed from a purely historical.  Look at how people of different races interacted if you even saw black, brown or asian people.  Look how asian's always speak in broken english and are defferential to the extreme,  Blacks of course are often but not always shown as baffoons.  The USA had just defeated Adolf Hitler and his eugenics machineso the country had a slightly more enlightened attitude reflected in TV shows like Medic.

The video and audio quality of this set is watchable but nothing steallar.  Medic is almost a docudrama in its format.  Ben Casey and Dr. Kildare in compassion were more like just fictional TV shows telling compelling stories that played liberally with medical truth.",1402531200,,1784,4.6158730158730155

8236914,5,B00104AYOM,"Medic is clean family entertainment that teaches medicine and about diseases in plain language with great story telling and great acting by actors who are now famous. I remember watching these episodes on tv in the 50's when I was a kid and they were fascinating and instructive. I learned a lot from them. I also learned compassion from them. Great teaching tool for your children, and you adults will enjoy them too. So glad they are on DVD now.",1200182400,9,447,4.6
