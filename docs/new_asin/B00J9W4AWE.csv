6349347,5,B00J9W4AWE,"I saw this show on hulu and am super glad it has some shows out on DVD!

To start, this looks like the product which came out recently as a Targets exclusive dvd, which includes episodes
Pilot, Favorite Show, Newgoat, Thebritbrats, Babysitterwar, Goomersitting, and revengeofthebritbrats

Unfortunately it's not the whole first season, but still, glad some of it is out on DVD now.  The show itself is pretty hilarious, watching the bubbly airheaded Cat and the street-smart, tough girl Sam try to get along as they start a baby sitting business.

The show is fun, but the dvd's closed captions are not well placed, obscuring the pictures at times.  That drops the rating on this particular product some, otherwise a good product.  4.5/5.0",1397001600,6,739,4.967479674796748
