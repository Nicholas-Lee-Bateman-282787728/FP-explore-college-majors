7828511,4,6302646219,"This is a realistic shoot-em-up, and very entertaining. It's about two cops who abandon the force and are working outside the law, ""dedicating themselves to crime and extortion"" as the clamshell cover to this VHS says...they do just fine and dandy until they tangle with el Falcon Negro (Almada).
Filmed in Huatusco, Veracruz, the atmoshpere is fascinating, and tantalizing, as the snow falls outside my window, here in Massachusetts. This is the second film I've seen this week with Veracruz as the setting (""Danzn"" being the other one) and I find it incredibly beautiful.
I don't think there were any second takes on this film...it's just like watching real life, where sometimes the doors don't open on the first try, for instance...and that's part of what makes it fun to watch...and Mario Almada ! What an actor. With his craggy, furrowed face, and eyes that say more than words, he's absolutely brilliant.",972864000,,911,5.0
