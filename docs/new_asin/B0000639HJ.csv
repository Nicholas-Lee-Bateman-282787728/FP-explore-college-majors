7958885,5,B0000639HJ,"Sega's take on the magical girl anime genre is undoubtedly the best. You've probably seen Card Captor Sakura and Sailor Moon, but Saint Tail AKA Meimi Haneoka puts all those other magical girls to shame. Her personality is much stronger than Serena's/Sailor Moon's, and her escapades with Asuka Jr. are full of both humor and intrigue. Sega does a masterful job of holding our interest in the series by setting two characters up for a romance and then frustrating that chance for happiness with everything that could possibly come between them. This series is a must-have if you are a true Sega fan!

If you are new to Saint Tail, I recommend trying this DVD collection. There are more episodes on this disc than there are in collections 1-4. Also, these episodes will give you the best ""feel"" for what Saint Tail is really all about, without spoiling the end of the series or revealing its beginnings. This DVD collection is the fifth of six and contains the following episodes:

Episode 16 - Steal the Chinese Iron Chef!
St. Tail decides to steal the chef of a popular Chinese restaurant in town. Why does she want him?!

Episode 17 - The Heart Thief on St. Valentine's Day??
A message from Saint Tail gets mixed up. Now she's going to steal a boy's ""heart"" instead of his notebook?!

Episode 18 - Danger, Do Not Touch! Super Electric Trap
A famous artist's work is stolen and rigged to a deadly trap. Will Saint Tail realize the situation before it's too late?

Episode 19 - A Comet Approaches! The Earth's Final Night??
Everyone is excited about seeing a comet that only comes around every 50 years, but the local observatory is going to be off-limits to everyone other than scientists! Will Saint Tail be able to help prevent a potential disaster??

Episode 20 - Get Back the Phantom Bird Egg!
Two renown scientists are at odds when one steals the egg of a bird thought to have been extinct. Can Saint Tail hatch a scheme to save the egg in time?

Episode 21 - Steal the Memorable Harmonica!
A girl's heirloom harmonica goes missing just before a recital. Will Meimi be able to help her? Or will she just have to face the music??

Episode 22 - The U.F.O. Appears!? A Town in Panic!
Photos of a mysterious UFO have emerged and are going to be put on display at a much-anticipated exhibition. Where did the photos come from? Will the UFO come back before Saint Tail shows up?!",1264204800,3,2379,4.568075117370892
7958886,5,B0000639HJ,"I don't really care about the dubs, it sounded too amerian(I know it is a us release, so I don't blame it on them). But anyway the show is still fine just with the subs, I see no problems. The show is still great. But it was cheaper, what do most of you expected? Over all the show is as good as it should be.",1100131200,2,309,3.769230769230769
7958887,2,B0000639HJ,I think it is very hard to read the words and look at the movie but some times it can help you learn to speak japanese.i will not buy till you make it in English.,1034726400,2,162,3.657142857142857
7958888,1,B0000639HJ,"My girls have been fans of Sailor Moon, Rayearth, Tenchi and many other series.  We came across Saint Tail by accident, but my younger girls really enjoy the series and wait impatiently until the release of the next DVD.  This release came as a big disappointment for them.
  I understand why the company chose to do this (lower cost for them), but I think they need to keep in mind their audience.  It would have been easy for the company to either release two DVD products or to have included both languages on the DVD.
  I don't know if this change in format will stop us from buying further Saint Tail DVD's.  It will all depend on if the consumers (my girls) fail to watch this DVD as much as the previous titles because it is too difficult for them to read and watch the action at the same time. The whole purpose for watching a movie is enjoyment, not frustration.",1025568000,8,871,4.366459627329193
7958889,1,B0000639HJ,"""Many of our customers request that there be no English soundtrack. This is a problem for many Anime producers. Fans are split on whether there should be one or not"". This is the official line from Tokyo Pop. Saint Tail - Girl of Justice does not have an English audio track. The truth of the matter would be that it is cheaper for them to release an anime without English audio - no voice actors to pay. In compensation, they have included 3 extra episodes. If I'm wrong, then score one for anime purists but how do you explain to two 4 and 7 year old girls, that have difficulty reading subtitles, that volume 4 of Saint Tail is the last they'll ever see ?. This is a show for *** young children *** not adults (and in turn anime purists), so why, by the exclusion of English audio, are they aiming for this market ? Normally I would rate anything in Saint Tail 4 or 5 stars , my children absolutely love this series, but this one gets only 1 star from me. Luckily there's still the excellent Nadia and Cardcaptors (our local released version not the Nelvana mess) for them to watch.",1022198400,3,1085,4.323529411764706
7958890,5,B0000639HJ,"There isn't much of a change in this next installment of Saint Tail. Asuka Jr. starts questioning about how he truly feels for Meime, and Meime continues her secret identity as Saint Tail-stealing back what was wrongfully stolen from the rightful owners in the first place. What IS new on this DVD, is that Tokyopop took the plunge and put a total of 7 episodes on this disc!!!! The bad thing is, for all you dubbed fans,you will be slightly dissapointed in finding out that they do not dub on any of these episodes. I don't know if it's just for this disc or if they plan on continueing it this way. Either way it doesn't bother me. This series is great!!! If your looking for a good clean and entertaining series, this is the one, look no further!!! But this is the fifth DVD in the series...you might want to start with the first one that is titled Theif of Hearts. This cute little series will keep you coming back for more!!!",1021420800,6,930,4.381502890173411
