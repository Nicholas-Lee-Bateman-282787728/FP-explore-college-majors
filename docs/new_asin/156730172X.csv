7796780,4,156730172X,"""The Travelling Players""(1975) is directed by Theodoros Angelopoulos. The film follows the story of travelling Greek actors from 1939 to 1952. Close-up shots take back stage to long shots with the movie presenting the world as if it were a stage of events that we are viewing. Often events take place beyond our view with only sounds signalling what is occurring. Empty rooms or empty streets are fixed by the static camera as if they are stages with events passing through them. At times it is difficult to know what is a play and what are the real events, and sometimes the actors stare straight into the camera telling us their story and drawing us into their world which further emphasizes the notion of the world as being a stage of which we are apart. The environments presented are very much a depiction of small town life along the coast, far away from the big cities, so there is a quiet quality about all of the proceedings that take place even when fights break out between warring factions. One is far more likely to hear the sound of people's footsteps or the voices of people talking in the largely deserted streets rather than the sound of an automobile. This gives the film's somewhat more violent events such a disarming and surrealist effect. It also seems to make the violence seem all the more pitiful and senseless. It's as if the director is saying how pointless all of the posturing and political views are. There are no heroes depicted here, only people living in a world that is largely beyond their control.

This particular Korean dvd, with Korean or English subtitles, has no extras of any kind. The dvd has a clean image though the image doesn't have the high resolution one might expect from a high quality dvd. The image quality lacks some detail and is closer to 480p than 720p, and so appears more like a VHS tape with slightly blurry images when viewed on a 50"" TV.",1378512000,2,1899,4.601769911504425
7796781,5,156730172X,"A flawed masterpiece from Angelopoulos, the first of a number of great
films of his you can pick at if you want. It's tragic that one of the best
modern film-makers is virtually unknown here in the U.S., and that
so few of his films are currently available.

First and foremost, 'The Traveling Players' is a technical achievement;
almost 4 hours long and only about 80 cuts in the whole film! It goes
against all we've gotten used to in film story-telling, and does it brilliantly.

The story follows a troupe of actors back and forth through the years
1939 to 1952. They're thrown about by the violent, sometimes absurd
tides of Greek history, with victory over the Nazi's giving way to the
rise of local fascists at home.

The film is very Brechtian and distanced in style. We hardly get to
know the characters at all, despite the running time. It's much more
interested in the great tides of politics and time than individuals -
which is both its strength and its weakness. I was always interested,
sometimes horrified, but rarely touched emotionally. Also, some of the
good/bad of the politics felt simplistic.

That said, despite its length, I will re-watch it. I suspect I'll
appreciate the amazing scope of it's vision and the bravery of it's
style even more without expecting to get caught up in the people in a
conventional way.

If you have the chance, get ahold of the 'New Star' DVD, which was only
in release a short time. The transfer was supervised and approved by
Angelopoulos, and certainly looks wildly better than the VHS

Update:  Artificial Eye has released a series of box sets of Angelopoulos' films
in the UK.  They can be found on Amazon.uk.  These are region 2, so you'd
need a region free player.  The qualityis very high.  I compared ""The Traveling Players""
in the set, with the New Star release and they were nearly identical in image quality.
Perhaps the New Star had a tiny edge, to my taste in the color arena. The New Star is
just slightly cooler in tone, faces are less ruddy.  But the image is so similar I imagine
they could easily have come from the same master, and who can say which
colors would be closer to the original intent.

There's a bigger difference in sound.  The New Star has a 5.1 dolby re-mix
which I found slightly cleaner and more appealing than the Artificial Eye's
simple dolby stereo.  But one could make a good argument that the original
film wasn't mixed in 5.1, so the stereo mix is more true to the original.",1292457600,3,2492,4.589164785553048
7796783,4,156730172X,"The outline of the film is that in 1952, the players debark and look back upon the prior thirteen years of their nation's turmoil. The film then shifts back to 1939, and proceeds in a straight chronological fashion back to 1951. The players, who may or may not be related by blood, are a mixed lot of old and young, male and female. Early on, the young males join the Communist Party to first fight off the Nazi Occupation, and then battle the Nationalist Greek government. Yet, we barely see them throughout the rest of the film. No single actor dominates and all are fairly anonymous (which is why giving the names of the characters (the few one might be able to discern) and the actors is pointless; although, at three points in the film, characters break the fourth wall to speak directly to the audience in soliloquies. The first is when an old player talks on a train about his experiences battling the Turks in the 1920s. The most jarring- and least effective- is when a raped woman turns her suffering into a diatribe on the rape of Greece by outside forces. The final one is when a prisoner of war returns home to describe his torture, including the Sisyphan task of moving rocks up hills, only to move them back down. This usage, however, only emphasizes the fact that they are not real individuals, but a literal Greek Chorus, commenting on the history that passes them by, for never do they really participate. They are almost always passive observers. This is most starkly represented when we see the players scurrying in the dark foreground of a street battle between Communists and Nationalists in a lighted background. Both parties advance and retreat in a highly choreographed, symbolic, and beautiful way. Yet, never do the players take sides in the historical drama. Another scene where this is made clear is when the players are stopped by British forces who make them perform their pastoral play, called Golfo The Shepherdess, on a beach- the only time we see the troupe get to perform it to its completion, for, before that, is always interrupted, but not in the humorous manner it would be in a Fellini film. When stopped, one of the older male players pleads for mercy to the British that they are not Communists. The scene ends with the Brits and players dancing together to an accordion version of It's a Long Way To Tipperary, only to end with a gunshot piercing and killing one of the young British soldiers, who falls to his death in the sand.

  In some ways, the narrative of the film also has the feel of an M.C. Escher drawing, with each scene seemingly connected to another, but in a disjunct manner that forces the characters into dead ends, and then Mbius Loops that merely serve to leave them where they started. This is almost certainly what the whole film is, with it ending in 1951, and the family debarking a train, only to have the narration tell us that it's 1939, again. Perhaps this loop for the players will be a year shorter than the last, but there is no way to tell. The only certainty is that the players will never escape their history, and the players, as a collective whole, will endure, even as individual members wander off or are killed (sometimes via Classical betrayal). In short, there will always be Juvenalian Watchmen.

  The transfer of the Region 2 DVD, from the Greek company New Star, is better than the version of Days Of '36 that they released. It is nearly pristine. There are no extra features to speak of, save for colored subtitles which allow for easier reading. The film is in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The scoring by Loukianos Kilaidonis rarely is extra-diagetic. Most of the music ushers forth from the characters and their natural surroundings, which only adds to the Symbolic quality of the film. The screenplay by Angelopoulos alone, is a damned good one, as described above. The only flaw being its length, one wonders if a more experienced (at that time) screenwriter could have convinced Angelopoulos to trim the script and film down into unequivocal greatness.

  The cinematography, by longtime Angelopoulos collaborator, Giorgos Arvanitis, is superlative. There are scenes in the real world that feel otherworldly, and there are scenes that are symbolic that look real. Arvanitis makes beauty out of grubby alleys, twisted garbage and debris, and evokes emotions with long dolly shots, often looking away from the seeming main action of a scene to focus on a seemingly minor thing. He also will have the camera linger on a character's reaction to something, without showing us the thing, or showing it only later than expected. There are also very few sunny shots in this film. In fact, the whole Angelopoulos canon has few shots that are sunny in it. Hibernal dawns and dusks, earth tones, and cool blues, abound. The man seems to relish the hues, real and psychological, that are evoked by overcast skies. It is also claimed that the whole 222 minutes of the film is wrought with less than a hundred individual shots- a remarkable show of formal patience, and trust in the images and audience's appreciation for them, on the part of the director.
  The Travelling Players should also be commended for not falling into the trap of caricaturization, which often happens with clumsily deployed symbolism. No group- not Nazis nor Communists, British nor Italians, Nationalists nor Americans, are shown as without blame in the Greek situation. This is because the film, despite its abundant use of political symbols, is definitely not a political film, but a Symbolic one. The Symbolism dominates the political content for the focus is on illustrating human behavior in extremis; a condition brought about by the politics of the time. But, it could just as easily have been brought about by religious oppression, natural disasters, or disease. A final point about this remarkable and daring film is that, despite its length, and despite its deployment of Symbols, it is, unlike the films of David Lean, definitely not an epic. In fact, the film deliberately miniaturizes history into the small moments, a collage of indignities, that define the lives of the players, and in that miniaturization, it maximizes the human experience for its audience. How many films, great or not, can stake that claim?",1283299200,2,6275,4.817084493964717
7796784,5,156730172X,"A weary, expressionless acting troupe arrives at a near empty train station in a rural Greek village. The itinerant actors have arrived into town to perform a popular, idyllic, pastoral play entitled Golpho The Shepherdess. The actors seem indistinguishable from each other, and only their literary names, derived from the Aeschylus Oresteia trilogy (Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, The Eumenides), provide a glimpse into their true character: the father, Agamemnon (Stratos Pachis); the adulterous mother, Clytamnestra (Aliki Georgouli); the traitorous uncle, Aegisthus (Vangelis Kazan); the avenging daughter, Elektra (Eva Kotamanidou); the revolutionary son, Orestes (Petros Zarkadis); and the self-involved daughter, Chrisothemis (Maria Vasileiou). The Travelling Players chronicles the turbulent recent history of Greece, from the Nazi occupation of World War II to the devastating Civil War between the Royalists and the Communists. Throughout the film, the troupe inexhaustibly attempts to perform the same play from village to village, only to be invariably disrupted by air raids, arrests, gunfire, and murder. Even their attempts to reach the next town often prove to be daunting as they encounter the bodies of executed rebels, are detained by supercilious Allied soldiers seeking entertainment, or are terrorized by their own countrymen searching for partisan rebels hiding in the mountains. Figuratively, the travelling players are transient, anonymous supporting players in their nation's own unresolved history - refugees within their own decimated country - eternally doomed to wander aimlessly through the austere and turbulent landscape, unable to go home again.

Theo Angelopoulos creates a harsh, bleak, and profoundly tragic portrait of the dissolution of the national soul in The Travelling Players. Angelopoulos frames the characters through medium and long shots in order to create a distant camera perspective, and reflects their own insignificance in their reluctant roles as peripheral witnesses to the country's turmoil. The unemotive, Byzantine countenance of the actors, similar to the muted expressions of the characters in Robert Bresson's films, further manifest, not only the ravaged, desolate villages of the Greek countryside, but also the emotional toll of the unending violence. The lyrics of a repeated ballad echoes the hopelessness and melancholy of the wandering players: ""You will come back, no matter how many years go by, you will come back, full of remorse, to ask forgiveness, one night in shame you will come back"". It is an elegy that mourns the loss of a great love, and solemnly awaits the return of a broken soul despite the ravages of time - a haunting, passionate serenade for a wounded nation still attempting to reconcile with its devastating, self-destructive past.",1262822400,6,2823,5.658018867924528
7796785,5,156730172X,"The Traveling Players is a classic of great depth and magnitude offering us glimpses of the suffering of rural Greece during its long agony from German Occupation through the civil war and into the fifties.  The acting is excellent and the counterpoint between the simple play that the travelling actors perform and the often ghastly events of the areas they pass through. ranges from being moving to emotionally overpowering.  There's an ancient tragedy working its way through the lives of this family of players as well, like a poisonous, underground stream.  But it might have been more subtly handled if characters had not had such obvious names such as Agamemnon, Orestes, etc.  Still, one of the most extraordinary features of the film consists of three lengthy and searing monologues of three characters respectively speaking directly to the film's audience.  Although the film is definitely a masterpiece, it can also be an endurance test for those unfamiliar with modern Greek history.  Shifts in time are often confusing and the pacing throughout is snail-like, thus accounting for the nearly four-hour running time.  And the truth is that it may take more than one viewing to comprehend the richness and genius of the film, despite its flaws.  But it's grreatly worth the effort.",1259798400,2,1291,5.114285714285714
7796786,5,156730172X,"Greek film director Theo Angelopoulos is one of the most influential and widely respected contemporary filmmakers, yet his films are still largely unknown to the American public.  There are several reasons for this seeming lack of popularity, the main one being that Angelopoulos' films are the antithesis of action films: his cinema is a cinema of contemplation.  Angelopoulos forces the spectator into the role of co-author and co-voyager as he or she must contemplate the images and events as they unfold on the screen.  The fact that Angelopoulos holds a deep fascination for Greek myths, history, and culture, for the most part unfamiliar to the American audiences, does not add to his films' popularity in this country.

Angelopoulos came to international attention with the release in 1975 of ""O Thiassos"" (""The Travelling Players"").  The subject historical epic is the adventures of a group of actors traveling across Greece from 1939 until 1952, performing ""Golfo,"" a traditional 19th Century Greek classic tale of unrequited love.  In this way, the film covers the last days of the Metaxas dictatorship, the beginning of the World War II, the German occupation, the Liberation and the arrival of the English and the Americans, and the Civil War.  Greece's political history and the actors' lives are being woven together along this journey.

The camera of Georges Arvantis has been crucial in all of Angelopoulos' films, and ""The Travelling Players"" is no exception.  Two-thirds of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle, subdued colors, recorded in the drab light of wintry dawns and dusks.  The film is shot almost entirely in long shots that are also long takes, many lasting several minutes, and some as long as seven to nine minutes.  The retelling of these thirteen years of history, covered in 240 minutes, required only eighty scenes or takes.  On several occasions, during some long takes, there is a shift in time, which is meant to underscore the political linkage between the pre- and post-war military regimes.  At other times, objects or characters come into the camera's restricted field of view , somewhat poorly framed, and even unpredictably at times, while outside sounds, near or far away, remind the viewer of the existence of an outside, unseen world.  Many of these long takes with little action in them often follow moments of intense emotion.  They become, in fact, resting points where the viewer can reflect on the dramatic event he or she has just witnessed. There are three particular long takes, in full shots, with the camera immobile, during which three of the main characters, Agamemnon, Electra, and Pylades, each in turn recount key moments in the history of their country.  During these monologues, the actors speak monotonously, without inflection or emotion.  But other than these three instances when history becomes intimate through these testimonials, history is observed from a distance, without fanfare, without insightful dialogue.

This film is composed as a mosaic of scenes rather than an ordered narrative as Angelopoulos switches back and forth in time and from one character to another. Using these distancing devices is one of the ways by which Angelopoulos forces the audience to reflect on the broader themes, rather than just the individual participants and moments.

There are no leading stars in this film.  Although Orestes is certainly an important character, and the second half of the film is Electra's story even more than Orestes', the true protagonist is the group of players itself.  As time passes, the group membership changes, but the group itself survives as a living character.

""The Travelling Players"" is a meditation on history and myth.  In this film, Angelopoulos examines the political power elite, monarchist-fascist, supported by foreign powers that had obstructed Greek democracy since at least 1936.  This is a continuation of his investigation, which began with ""Days of '36"" (1972), and would continue with ""Megalexandros"" (1979).  Angelopoulos' views contradict the ""official"" Greek history and constitute a fundamental revision of history in which the Left, in general, and the Communist Party of Greece in particular, are given their proper places, and are not depicted as the moral threat to Greek democracy.  Angelopoulos' main arguments for this revision have to do with the nature of the Greek resistance to the German occupation and the civil war which followed.

In this representation, Greece is no longer the Greece of the travel brochures, with its eternal sunshine and beautiful islands.  Instead of the ""travel poster"" Greece, Arvantis' camera shows us a land with its scruffy homes, rundown ""kafeneons,"" crumbling stone walls, and rutted streets.  Greece is no longer the cradle of western democracy, but a place where tyranny is deeply-rooted, and its enchanted islands are places of detention, torture and executions.  Greece is a land possessed by Hunger and Death.

On a mythological level, the characters play out a modern version of the myth of the ""House of Atreus.""  As it is in Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon,"" betrayal is a major theme of the film, betrayal on a personal level by some members of the troupe.  But on the contemporary historical level, the betrayal is that of Greece, from outside by other nations, but even more tragically, from within itself.  Through this parallel Angelopoulos unambiguously suggests the repetitive cyclical nature of human existence.

On the other hand, since Aeschylus's Oresteia also relates the birth of Athenian democracy, it is from this lesson that Angelopoulos, continuing the lesson of Aeschylus, thematically links individual tragedy to the national struggle for freedom.

""The Travelling Players"" is a powerful historical epic, if not an unusual one, as far as American audiences' expectations are concerned.  I would certainly discourage seeing this as a first exposure to Angelopoulos' films.  For those who appreciate Angelopoulos' work, it is one of his finest works, worthy of several viewings.  Personally, I give the film a five-star rating, but viewers who are unfamiliar with Angelopoulos' films will give it one star.",1224288000,8,6188,5.256358087487284
