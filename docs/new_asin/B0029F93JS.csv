8357793,5,B0029F93JS,"""Who Killed Amanda Palmer?"" Fortunately, she's not actually dead. Not only is she alive and well, but she's producing some of the most unique music you can find in stores. The ""Who Killed Amanda Palmer?"" DVD is an excellent companion to her album of the same name -- dark, playful, weird and rebellious, and full of cabaret punk attitude.

Just a tip, though: Palmer has specifically asked her fans to buy it from her own site, apparently because the label has pretty much ignored her DVD and will keep all the money for itself if it's ordered from elsewhere. Keep it in mind.

Anyway, this DVD contains a music video for almost every song on the ""Who Killed Amanda Palmer?"" album, plus a couple of live performances. It opens with ""Intro: Another Year,"" with Palmer slumped over a piano, in a room cluttered with dusty toys, concert tickets, brass candlesticks, gilded bottle-stoppers, banners, wrenches, and a tattered wedding veil on a mannequin.

After that, we get a string of associated music videos: ""Astronaut"" is all stark color and shadow, with blurry videos of kids and rockets; ""Ampersand"" drifts through a decayed mansion as Palmer either plays piano or takes off her clothes; ""Runs in the Family"" is a wild, choppy schizophrenic video showing Palmer thrashing, crawling, rolling through a messy room as she sings about mental illness. If you liked ""Girl Anachronism,"" you might like this. ""The Point of It All"" is  a beautifully languid, burned-out video full of flowers and sewing machines.

Then in ""Strength Through Music,"" Palmer wanders through a white-light-filled, dreamlike highschool, even as maddened teens collapse around her... leading into ""Guitar Hero,"" in which she revives the teens and ushers them into the world of rock. ""Another Year"" is a languid morning-light affair following Palmer's art; ""Oasis"" is freakishly chipper in how it deals with rape and abortion; ""Leeds United"" follows a sleek nightclub act with a wild audience, dancers and soccr guys.

Finally, ""Blake Says"" is a chilly blurry video with a disheveled, gown-clad Palmer running through a grey snowy town, even as the titular character wanders as well. And ""What's the Use of Wondrin'?"" is a creepily beautiful Rodgers and Hammerstein song, highlighted by by Palmer and Annie Clark as a pair of slow-dancing, jello-making June Cleavers who bare their souls about rotten abusive men.

There's also a couple of live performances with the Danger Ensemble: ""Blake Says"" and ""Have To Drive,"" with a corseted Palmer sitting under shifting lights and murmuring her way through the songs, as strings are played and a passionate floor show is performed. Additionally, there are interviews and commentary, but let's face it: the real centerpiece of this DVD is the music videos.

Director Michael Pope is simply brilliant. He matches his style to whatever the song is, so perfectly that you would think Palmer herself had directed them -- jagged cuts, long drifting close-ups, great washes of pale light/color, tattered gothy costumes, and countless little symbolic knick-knacks strewn around (sun and moon, Buddha, peeling walls and toy soldiers). And his camera loves to stick to Palmer, with her tattooed eyebrows, pale skin and impishly rebellious expressions.

And he comes up with some brilliantly, wickedly funny moments. Example: Palmer and Clark sit down to a dinner table, where a naked man is lying with an apple in his mouth. They clink glasses, and pick up big rusty forks and butcher knives. Palmer's grin says it all.

The music videos of ""Who Killed Amanda Palmer?"" DVD are simply brilliant, and add new dimensions to Palmer's wild, wicked, winsome music.",1280534400,13,3661,5.096828046744574
8357794,5,B0029F93JS,"A friend introduced me to Amanda Palmer I really actually liked it. I searched for some video disc for her. We both watched it an enjoyed the videos. Most of the footage is in like a darker setting, but it is called Who Killed Amanda Palmer, so it makes sense I guess.

As for the music you find on here, you need to have a taste for music that is different. It is mostly slow (for me anyway), but has great lyrics.

Unfortunately since we watched it very late and I no longer have the disc, there's not much I else I can say from memory.

Bottom line: A must for any Amanda Palmer or Dresden Dolls fan!!",1280188800,2,604,4.101694915254237
