8305322,5,B001GGNTQE,"My mother started using this video following a massive stroke in which she was suppose to be permanently paralyzed on the right side of her body.  Thankfully the neurologist was wrong and my mother regained the use of her right side and continued to be able to walk and care for herself for the next 5-years, largely in part to the strength training and balance training provided in this video. Her physical therapist said it was the best exercise program for middle-aged and elderly people she had ever come across.  My mother was an RN and ordered the video off TV.

BTW: I bought this video for my elderly in-laws who are in need of strength and balance training, and I enjoy working out with it as well.",1439769600,2,707,4.5078125
