8554857,5,B00ANRG4EQ,"We really wanted to learn how to cha-cha for some time and decided to try out some different instructors and were quite pleased with the change of pace.  Kristin and her partner go pretty slow and really take their time to explain why things work the way the do and how to best utilize the knowledge and skills they are giving you.  We never had to pause or rewind any of the DVDs but do plan to watch volume 3 again soon to solidify some of the moves we learned.  We were new to the dance and can say with certainty, we learned how to cha-cha!.",1399680000,,545,4.122641509433962
