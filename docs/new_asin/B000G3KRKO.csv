8128928,5,B000G3KRKO,Personal story of one man's quest for truth.  He is very entertaining but unfortunately the video was made as he was presenting this talk to an all-male audience.,1513209600,,162,4.785714285714286
8128929,2,B000G3KRKO,"Just don't like his style.  A bit too disrespectful in his jokes on marriage for me.  Seems like his volume is more like telling than speaking.  I thought it might be good for teens cause of another review, but his audience is a men's conference, so the material also covers the vocations of husband & father.",1473033600,,309,4.482142857142857

8128932,5,B000G3KRKO,"A great presentation filmed at a men's conference, done in the form of a stand-up comedy routine, but never foolish or disrespectful. Dr Ray Guarendi covers the basic concerns and objections of the Catholic Faith in a very logical and entertaining manner. He addresses the moral position of the Church and debunks the illogical opinions against the moral position of the church. Having once been temporarily a Protestant himself he lovingly defends their fervor and their love for our Lord before he begins his presentation, but he doesn't affirm the Protestant position itself. I strongly recommend the following dvds all Catholics should have in their collection. This one of course. The Patrick Madrid version of the similar title Why Be Catholic? (When you could be anything else), Ray Guarendi's other dvd set What Catholics Really Believe, Fr. John Corapi's The Teachings Of Jesus Christ a 50 episode Catechism of The Catholic Church series (don't let his current bad situation deter you, He speaks complete truth in this series), and Where Did The Bible Come From from St. Michael's Media, currently very pricey on Amazon or possibly unavailable. I haven't checked in a while. You may need to go to Saint Michael's Media itself. One more thing, this dvd  also comes with two CDs of what's on the DVD so you can have some good inspirational Catholic teaching in your car. I find this very comforting since there are no Catholic radio stations in my listening area.",1316995200,5,1470,4.975609756097561
8128933,5,B000G3KRKO,"Catholic apologetics with a comedic twist. Not boring at all. Ray Guarendi has an appealing character with funny interjections. I found that this video would help non-Catholics understand what Catholics really believe, if you can get them to watch it. It helps clear up some misunderstandings with Protestants, revealing the Truth.",1244073600,3,331,5.509803921568627
8128934,5,B000G3KRKO,"Dr. Ray is witty, whimsical, and immensely convincing as he details his journey back to the Catholic faith.  As he shares the times he came to face himself and laughs at his own foibles and misunderstandings, he leads us to examine our own misconceptions about the church.  In the end we have to agree with Dr. Ray, there is only one reason to be Catholic; because its true!  The humor will have you crying from laughter yet getting the very serious message that what we believe makes a difference in where we place our hope.

In like manner, the discussion for fathers is enlightening, humorous, and practical for all Christian parents.

There will be much to think about and share often from what you see and hear in these two great programs.  Well worth the investment for a video you will want to watch and share again and again.",1219017600,,833,4.557046979865772
8128935,5,B000G3KRKO,"Dr. Ray is great!  He presents reasons for being Catholic in a very fun and entertaining format.  He discusses his personal testimony of returning to the Church along with apologetics, but his presentation is anything but dry.  Even my kids laughed out loud at Dr. Ray's stories and jokes.  He gives reasons for being Catholic using logical arguments and he adds great stories and illustations along the way.  Very worthwhile!  This dvd could be shared with non-Catholic friends and family to help explain why Catholics believe what they do, as well as Catholics who would like a better understanding of what it means to belong to the Church.",1166400000,11,642,4.898148148148148
