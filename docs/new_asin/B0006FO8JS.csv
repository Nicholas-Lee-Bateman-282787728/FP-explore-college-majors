8041384,5,B0006FO8JS,George Grove is a superb teacher. His relaxed and thorough introduction really make this a good buy. A must for all KT lovers.,1392422400,,126,4.521739130434782
8041385,5,B0006FO8JS,"I had met George Grove in Branson, Missouri when they came into town to perform. I went over to George and told him that I had ordered ""Banjo Arrangements of The Kingston Trio"" 2 nights before their show and did not know they were coming to town. George Grove took me aside and said he was so glad I got his instructional dvd, however, ""Don't play the D9th like I did on stage tonight, play it like the dvd shows"", he stated with passion.  He said that he was very satisfied with Happy Traum on the session. George was so down to earth and grateful to have put out this dvd.
  I would recommend it to anyone who seriously wants their banjo to have the Kingston Trio ""sound"".  It demonstrates how to do the Tom Dooley ""toggle"" that really takes the listener to the ""Trio's' signature. Also, covered is ""It Takes a Worried Man"", ""MTA"", Three Jolly Coachmen, and Hard, Ain't it Hard and more. When you learn these songs they will have the recognition immediately of the same intro style that is familiar to fans.
  The price is low compared to the amount of instruction on this dvd. I can only say you will be satisfied when it arrives.  George plays on his long banjo and explains how to play on your regular size instrument. Lots of fun and time going through these lessons and it is well spent purchasing this very fine dvd from Amazon.",1391731200,2,1336,4.384615384615385
8041386,5,B0006FO8JS,"I searched for months looking into other genres for banjo to play.  I had about given up hope, when I got this dvd and tab (comes with the dvd).  I learned more from this dvd about folk banjo than in all the other tab books, dvds (including P. Seegers) combined.

The dvd is clear, concise and very informative.  While it could be done by someone beginning, I think it is best left to banjo players who know a few chords on the instrument and have good hand technic to start with.  If you are looking to expand from bluegrass picking into other genres of music with the banjo, this dvd is for you.",1273104000,2,597,4.247787610619469
8041387,5,B0006FO8JS,"If you love the Kingston Trio sound, as I do, you can find very interesting tips provided in this DVD, which you can apply to the banjo as well as the guitar. George Grove does a masterful job on it.",1225152000,2,199,4.0
8041388,5,B0006FO8JS,"I have played the guitar for a while and have just started with the banjo. I have been listening to the Kingston Trio for over forty years. George Grove presents the material starting from easy, progressing to intermediate, and then gets into things that are way out of my league. Everything makes sense and it sounds just like it should; everything passes my sanity test. His instruction of what he calls ""Fake Frailing"" is just perfect for the beginner.  His demonstration of ""Early Morning Rain"" is just incredible for the more advanced player. ( I will be working on that one for a while.)  He keeps the material light using ample amounts of wit and humor.

My limited background of the guitar was all that was needed to get me well into these lessons. For someone starting out cold, some kind of very basic banjo primer would be required. This DVD is perfect for someone who is familiar with the Kingston Trio and is familiar with the basics such as how to tune the banjo and make basic chords.

Wow, I would love to see a companion DVD that demonstrates Kingston Trio guitar technique as well.
