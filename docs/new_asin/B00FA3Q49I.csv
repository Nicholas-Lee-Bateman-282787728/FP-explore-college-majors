8613642,1,B00FA3Q49I,"I did not purchase this product, but if the review regarding ""dress up"" clothes for a paper doll is true, then you can buy this same product for $14 at multiple places.  I agree the description & the price would make me believe I was receiving dress up clothes for my child not a paper doll.",1386979200,4,291,4.196428571428571
8613643,2,B00FA3Q49I,"While it is true that you get the DVD, the description is very misleading.  The ""dress up play set"" is a small set of paper cut outs.
My 5 year old granddaughter was very specific when asking for this item.  She wanted to dress up like Sophia.  Not likely to happen with this set!  The product information on this should be updated immediately.  At best it is misleading, at worst it is "" bait and switch""!",1386460800,8,406,4.2894736842105265
