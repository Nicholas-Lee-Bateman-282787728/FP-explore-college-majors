It is full of crazy costumes, and there are many comical things in it like a man whose arms are 15 feet long, a man who is painted gold, and a tiger style kungfu practicioner who is painted with tiger stripes and roars when he fights.
The fight scenes are actually not that bad, but the rest of the movie is not very well made, and the story is a little boring at times. Polly Shang Kwan is alright in this film, her fight scenes are good, but she has definitely been in better films than this. I gave this film four stars because I am aware that some people like these very weird kungfu movies, and for those people this film would be excellent. The film is full of superhuman powers and magic, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes very strange and comical kungfu movies.",1041724800,2,851,4.291925465838509

I don't want to give too much away, but I'll give you the basic idea.  A young woman wants to be trained in Shaolin kung-fu, but can't because she's female.  A monk goes against the rules and teaches her Kung-Fu. The plot goes on from there.  I told you, I'm not giving to much away so you'll have to see the movie yourself.  I definitely suggest purchasing it today!  You won't be disappointed, I promise!!",993168000,,531,4.412371134020619
