8227341,4,B000X9LQH4,"in the nearly 30 years since HIV/AIDS has was publicly identified by the scientific community, the deadly disease has ravaged people across the globe, regardless of color, gender, class or social status.  However, as it relates specifically to black Americans, the prolificacy of the disease has taken a frightening turn over the years.

As initiated by ABC journalist Peter Jennings before his untimely death, the special examines the issue of HIV/AIDS as viewed through a lens of black America.  A wide cross section of individuals- primarily African-American- are interviewed, both individually and in groups.  Men, women, gay (and/or LBGT), straight, medical physicians, social activists, and more.

Challenges of economics are explored, and how the lack of affordable health care affects those who are less affluent, and less likely to receive regular medical care.

Federal funding to have drug-needle exchange programs was briefly flirted with during the Clinton administration, but when the Gingrich-led GOP domination of Congress happened, combined with the Lewinsky sex-scandal/impeachment trial, all hopes for federal cooperation were dashed.

An alleged dearth of eligible single black men compared to single black women is seen as a factor; based on interviews, some men are said to gladly carouse, and some women are prone to tolerate it, and not be particularly pushy about STD testing, for fear it will scare the men off.

The criminal justice system is exposed as a factor-- the decades-old War on Drugs incarcerates blacks (including for non-violent offenses) at a higher percentage than they are in the general population.  It is alleged that elected officials and prison professionals won't publicly admit to the fact that same-sex contact (whether forced or consensual) takes place within prison populations, therefore condom distribution and HIV testing is minimal, if any, at a given site.

Intra-cultural myths, stereotypes, pathologies are explored here.  Lack of public dialogue about sexual matters in general among black adults is brought up.  Religious-fueled anti-gay tolerance, from the home to the pulpit, is one of the reasons why black LBGTs are afraid to come out, and frequently have little formal support in their home communities.  The ""down low"" phenomenon is examined.  The role of religious leadership is examined, including interviews with prominent pastors like TD Jakes, Jesse Jackson, Calvin Butts and Eugene Rivers.  Pastoral leadership is revealed to have been no more sophisticated about HIV/AIDS than the general public, and so religious leadership either remained silent on it compared to Civil Rights, or stood with the rigid moralism of the (primarily Caucasian) Religious Right community..

The cultural chasm between the politically active LGBT community and politically active blacks is seen as a factor-- many within black communities resent LGBT activists using the Civil Rights Movement as a parallel for gay rights; few of the public faces of gay rights activism are people of color, and formal outreach to urban/black areas is unexplored..

It is too bad that Jennings died before he could complete the special on his own.  Terry Moran and others fill in the gaps admirably, but it remains unknown just what else Mr. Jennings may have uncovered, even possibly doing a follow-up report.  Recommended for all settings- home, school (junior high age and up), church, civic group, etc.",1244592000,2,3441,5.422138836772983
8227342,5,B000X9LQH4,"I purchased this dvd--ABC News Primetime Out of Contral--AIDS in Balck America--to use in an educational discussion I was leading.  I did not view the original broadcast,fall 2007, so I did not know what was on the dvd, but the title fit my need.  The dvd content and delivery are compelling! This DVD can be used for family discussions, among friends, civic and church groups. It is that good. Interviews with a very good cross section of people directly affected by HIV/AIDS, professionals and leaders, politicians, and religious leaders are very revealing.  Great work--the message is disturbing because we are not doing enough individually and collectively, but the dvd goes a long way I think in making the case that we have been too ""laid back"" on this too long.  I am really glad I made this purchase and I am sharing the content with everyone I meet and know from now on.",1202428800,3,879,4.7254901960784315
