8086195,2,B000BF2KHU,"Now for the downside of this movie.  It is gross, disgusting, extremely gory, and perverted.  One difficult scene was when they cut off the man's p.....and tossed it on the floor.  I was typing at the time, looked up to see what was all the hollering about, and there it was.  Disgusting.  This is the main reason I am throwing this movie in the trash.",1366848000,,352,4.3538461538461535
8086196,4,B000BF2KHU,"Super models love guts, and I love the super models that eat 'em.
Clement's Meat Market films got me interested in 'Binge and Purge'--if you liked the other films, you will like this one.  If you don't like low budget, cookie cutter production-made movies, go away, this isn't for you...don't spoil it for everybody else.
The beginning is slow, but the last half hour is redeeming. The super models are lookers, the gore is interesting at parts (especially the scene where the cop punches through someone's head). It took a few turns to like this movie, but over time, it grew on me.
--one of the best parts is when the guy pukes on the janitor's face and melts it, then eats his eyeball and says, ""Mabye it's Maybalene.""--classic, just classic.",1088640000,,745,4.687022900763359

BINGE & PURGE tells the story of a plague. A plague that was brought to America from Spain in the 1930's. (The history of the plague is beautifully told in the opening scene). This plague turns ordinary people into flesh eating cannibals.
Meet the Helfringer girls. A group of models under the supervision of fashion designer Karl Helfringer. These girls are infected with the disease and are feeding their disease by picking-up homeless people, magazine reporters, and anyone else they can find and eating them.
Three detectives are on the case to try to discover why people are missing and why bodies are being found half eaten. They have another nemesis, ""The Captain"". ""The Captain"" is the head of the local police department and is also infected by the plague and by about 700 kilos of cocaine! So needless to say, ""The Captain"" has another agenda.
All the elements and characters of the story mesh well together to bring forth a very good movie. Brian Clement knows how to tell a story with visuals and mood.
A couple of scenes were stand-outs:
""The Captain"" at his desk snorting LARGE amounts of cocaine. (Obviously inspired by SCARFACE). He is watching a video tape that he found at a crime scene of a now dead super model named Cammy washing her scantily clad body in a tub. The camera cuts back and forth between the coke snorting antics of ""The Captain"" to the beautiful Cammy in the tub. This mixed with an eerie version of the Christmas classic, We Wish You A Merry Christmas, playing in the background and outstanding lighting which make the mood extremely intense. The scene comes to a climax as ""The Captain"" takes in an enormous amount of coke, Cammy in the tub, the music gets louder, and then we see the red dot of a laser scoped gun on the forehead of ""The Captain"". BAM! He is shot in the head.
Another scene shows the Helfringer girl named Audrey preparing some tasty treats. What makes this scene stand-out is that director Brian Clement presents it as a cooking show from the 60's. Audrey speaks to the camera in a Martha Stewart manner and very politely shows you how to prepare the guts of a human being for a scrumptious treat. It sounds crazy, I know, but trust me this scene rocks!
For the gore fans out there, you will not be disappointed! There is a ton of the red stuff and plenty of guttings to quench your thirst for gore.
I can not express how impressed I was with this movie. The art direction, music, camera work, lighting, and editing were easily amongst the best that I have seen on the independent scene.
Brian Clement is a name to remember. This guy has a ton of talent. Kudos to you Brian!
