2553552,4,B000F6ZIHY,"This DVD has too many commercials, and they are hard to skip. Other then that, the main yoga ""sculpt"" workout is good for me. The yoga ""challenge"" workout is really pretty difficult - and I am in pretty good shape and pretty flexible. This is not a good  DVD for novices.",1167782400,5,271,4.313725490196078
2553553,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. It has three separate workouts - a beginners Yoga, a more advanced Yoga and then a lower body toning segment that is AMAZING.

I have already done the lower body segment and it is really good; functional fitness focused and really works your legs within 20 minutes (not counting warm up and cool down).

I've previewed the yoga and it looks fantastic - great cueing and a nice workout, the advanced one has Rod Stryker with Kathy.

I think this is a great value for anyone looking to try yoga and also get a terrific and different lower body toning workout 'add-on'.",1154044800,15,606,4.541284403669724
2553554,4,B000F6ZIHY,"Kathy is one of the best instructors and when I heard she had a new workout dvd, I was busting to buy it and try it, but when it arrived, I saw that it's actually three of her previous workouts combined into one dvd package.  I was very disappointed.

However, having said that, she is great and these workouts are still very very good.  There are two classic yoga workouts and then a lower body toning one.  The first one is called New Yoga and is probably geared more toward intermediates.  While there are some easy stretches here, there are also some harder poses.  Then there is New Yoga Challenge - that's a bit tougher.  I personally like the last routine the best - it's called Functionally Fit Lower Body Firming.  You will really challenge your legs, tusch and hips.  All these workouts were first recorded in the mid 90's so the costuming is a little more 'old fashioned' but you will really benefit from doing these workouts every couple of days along with your regular cardio.",1152316800,30,989,4.5423728813559325
2553563,5,B000F6ZIHY,"This is a great combination of three different workouts.  I bought it just for the New Yoga Challenge, but love the fact it came with other workouts, too.  I had the New Yoga Challenge on VHS, and I have been looking for it on DVD format for quite some time.  I am glad I finally found it.

The New Yoga Challenge will whip you into shape in no time, it really is the best Yoga workout I have ever tried, and I've tried a ton.",1296777600,,426,3.976470588235294
2553564,4,B000F6ZIHY,"Very pleased with this video.  I was afraid it might be too difficult for a ""senior"" but it is both fun and challenging.  I have
been doing yoga for a number of years and this video helps to keep me focused.",1292284800,,207,4.024390243902439
2553565,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I Kathy Smith's dvds and her attitude towards physical exercise. Instructions are very precise, she stresses correct position before movement and gives you clear instructions throughout for a safe workout! Great pace, easy to follow with beginner to advanced models. This dvd offers a lot of variety! My favourite",1273017600,,313,5.408163265306122
2553566,4,B000F6ZIHY,It is an excelant DVD for sculpting. I thought it might be a little faster and more fat burning. But for sculpting it is great .Good directions for poses. Does anyone out thtere know a good fat buring yoga dvd? moffatjo@aol.com,1255737600,,227,4.560975609756097
2553567,5,B000F6ZIHY,"This is an excellent video.  I have many Yoga DVD's/Videos... and this is by far my favorite.  I especially like the middle workout ""New Yoga Challenge""...it's an intermediate workout, and Rod (Kathy's partner in the video) does most of the narration. Rod has a very soothing voice....  The workout is fantastic and the relaxation portion even more fantastic..  I always feel so good after I do this workout...and I must mention that Rod teaches you how to breath properly and you do have a warm up prior to exercising and stretches afterwards.  Many of my other videos do not have either...you plop it in the DVD/Video player and the workout starts immediately (which is not good to work out and not be warmed up).  So I would highly recommend this yoga video.",1239408000,5,761,4.7272727272727275
2553568,4,B000F6ZIHY,Seems like this video may be somewhat harder but as with all excercise tapes practice makes perfect. I LOVE Kathy's tapes and am sure this one will help me on my way to better fitness.,1231200000,2,184,4.285714285714286
2553569,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I have been using this yoga CD for over a year now and really enjoy the workout.  It has given me a great base for yoga and is just as good, if not better than any of the yoga classes I've taken.  Good variety for different skill levels, and good mix of standing, lying and sitting postures.",1219622400,,291,4.087719298245614
2553570,4,B000F6ZIHY,"I really enjoyed doing this yoga DVD. Kathy Smith isn't too perky and doesn't provide too much useless information during her workouts. The beginner yoga workout is fairly straightforward, although I could have used some better worded instruction on a few of the poses. When you're concentrating on contorting your body into different shapes it's a little annoying to keep having to look up at the TV screen to figure out exactly what you're supposed to be doing. But after you've done it once or twice you know what to do and it's a well-paced but challening workout. And the cool down at the end is extremely relaxing if you complete the whole thing.",1216857600,4,652,4.728070175438597
2553571,4,B000F6ZIHY,"I was a huge fan of Kathy Smith's beginners yoga video, so this reissued version with the addition of the intermediate yoga workout and the added bonuses is right up my alley.  Is Kathy Smith a true yoga instructor? No, and if you've done yoga classes, or done any of the Gaiam yoga videos, Kathy's lack of prowess is evident.  However, she still offers the best stretching of any yoga video I've ever done.  I genuinely feel relaxed after her beginning yoga workout--much like I did when I did weekly yoga class.  I can't say the same for the other 5 yoga videos I have.",1215993600,14,571,4.40952380952381
2553572,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I actually bought this on dvd becuase I owned the originals on vhs several years ago. She is the best at home yoga dvd I have tried. I've also tried Denise Austin and some others. Yoga Zone is pretty good too, I do have to say Kathy Smith is one of the best for Yoga. She gives great directions and I even got more of a peaceful state out of this vhs then when i was in an actual Yoga class at my college with a yoga instructor who had years experience.",1211155200,7,453,3.9347826086956523
8118359,2,B000F6ZIHY,Not a bad program but longer than I want and was not a fan of how the steps were shown/background visual and music.  Just a personal opinion.  There are many good poses and a quick paced flow - just not for me.,1444003200,,210,3.9761904761904763
8118360,3,B000F6ZIHY,"My yoga skills have diminished as I've grow older and this CD no longer fits the bill.  It's not that it's so hard, just too hard for my creaky knees,",1404086400,,150,4.0
8118361,1,B000F6ZIHY,"This is the same video as the other yoga workout.  The packaging is different, and the summary on the back is different.  I was a bit unhappy to find that I had purchased two of the same thing with just different pictures.  I felt that it was a bit dishonest to repackage a video and not mention that it was the same as the other yoga workout.
As far the the video/workout goes, it is pretty much a normal Kathy Smith workout.  I have owned several of her videos over the years and have never been unhappy, but I was discouraged that her company has repackaged an older video and re-marketed it as something newer or different.  I will be more careful when purchasing in the future.

As far as speed of receiving the videos, as always, I was quite pleased.  I have always had very good luck getting merchandise in a timely fashion.",1403136000,,831,4.357142857142857
8118362,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I got this Yoga DVD from somewhere else (thrift store) but had to write about it. I've now tried 4 different series (two purchased on Amazon) trying to find one that really works for me. I did 5+ years of Yoga but have been away from it for 10+ years, and so need to get back into it. If you are a beginner or intermediate student, this is a great choice. It moves well and the visuals are the best I've seen. This is not a slow series, yet it still gives instruction. Great way to get a Yoga workout and not stress out--yet if you want to ""stress"" you can do that in the poses. I'm very pleased with it.",1373241600,,604,4.0
8118363,3,B000F6ZIHY,"I like Kathy's earlier aerobic and step workouts. Yoga is less her thing. The set was pathetic. The ""challenge"" is mainly speed; no time to maintain a centered mindset. The squat workout is useful.",1362268800,,197,4.823529411764706
8118364,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I was very pleased with my purchase. I had this same video on VHS a few years ago and lost it. The yoga challenge was the one I lost.  I was happy that even though the cover was different, that this was the same video I had had on VHS. I was also happy with the price, much less than some of the other sites I reviewed.",1358208000,,319,3.7611940298507465
8118365,4,B000F6ZIHY,"What I liked:  The instructors gave very good instructions on the breathing and the form throughout the CD. Half way through you will feel that you have worked out.
What I didn't like:  too much advertising in the beginning of the CD. It seemed to go on forever before they actually started the routines.",1321315200,,304,4.611111111111111
8118366,4,B000F6ZIHY,Wonderful intro to yoga if you have never done it.  Very doable and good music.  I think yoga is the best way to shape up your arms and hips and there is such a low risk for injury.  Kathy is always the best trainer too.,1315267200,,220,3.8444444444444446
8118367,1,B000F6ZIHY,"I love Kathy Smith, but this video is really out of date, the picture on the front is of her more recently, but the video itself is from the 90's, so the music is really cheesy, and the yoga is very beginner level... I was disappointed.",1310860800,,236,4.1521739130434785
8118368,5,B000F6ZIHY,"I have tried a few different Yoga DVD's. I have been extremely fit and not at all fit. I know that my body just needs to get used to moving again and I will become strong. So I thought that Yoga would be a great addition to my workouts to change it up for a more well rounded workout schedule. Every other Yoga DVD that I have tried are too hard. They don't really explain what you're doing and it seems impossible to keep up with them.

This DVD, however, has a pre-workout explanation section. Kathy Smith talks about levels of fitness, how you should not do Yoga on a full stomach as well as her advice to warm up your muscles with a short walk or a warm shower before exercising. She gives advice throughout the workout about proper form and cautions that you should never strain into a pose because it's better to do a pose less intensely with correct form than to strain with improper form. She also suggests watching the DVD before you attempt the workout. Good advice so that you're not trying to watch AND attempt the pose at the same time which will pull you out of the correct pose.

I was able to do the complete beginner portion on the 2nd workout. I continue to get stronger and stronger with this DVD. I highly recommend it as a beginner and I will continue to use the DVD as I advance with the Challenge workout.

I also really enjoy the lower body routine that's an added bonus. I have noticed my lower body really shape up with the easy to follow instruction. You aren't doing a difficult routine. Kathy Smith emphasizes exactly how you should be perfoming each move to get optimal results. I tore my meniscus recently and was told by my doctor not to do any sort of exercise such as squats that may further injur my knee. I don't feel any strain while doing squats as directed by Kathy Smith. She mentions that you should not feel any strain in your knee as long as you do the movement correctly.",1303689600,,1915,4.328690807799443
