8102840,5,B000DZ962K,I love that it is set up so that you can do the whole sequence without verbal instruction after you have learned the moves. I don't think that the exercises were hard to learn or do at all. Some were more energetic and others nicely relaxing. A very good balance. I feel very energized and calm at the same time after doing the practice for the first time this morning and will use this DVD alot. Highly recommended!,1179878400,,416,4.346153846153846
8102841,3,B000DZ962K,"production is just bad. in the bulk of the video, the instructional half, he's performing the moves in what looks like his living room or something. that was just a bad choice and made it seem as if he was just trying to turn a quick buck. also, his form is a little lazy at times for a supposed master. my guess is that his title of master came with certificate from some place and only signifies that he's certified to teach. anyone with proficiency in the basic knowledge and forms can teach. my students could teach, but that doesn't make them masters. this guy i probably a decent teacher. but a master he is not. his body mechanics betray that fact.

i give it 3 stars because the exercises are genuinely good daoist exersices.

the back of the video says that he was trained directly by jerry alan johnson. my suggestion is that you pick up jerry allan johnson's video (chi kung: the healing workout). it has the same exercises plus more, and his true mastery of the art is readily apparent in the subtle perfection of his movement. problem is, you may only find the video on vhs as it was made back in 1993.

i already know every exercise on this video and can demonstrate them with far greater efficiency than bradley gilbert, so this video did nothing for me. but if you don't know these exercises and you really have a passion for qigong, then go for it.

i'm recommending these exercises, mind you, NOT the video. but sometimes we gotta work with what's available.

*****2010 EDIT******

Jerry Alan Johnson has finally released his chi kung video on DVD, and it has a couple of bonus features that are probably even more valuable than the exercises! SO NOW THERE IS NO REASON TO BUY THIS VIDEO BY BRADLEY GILBERT! buy Johnson's instead!

At the end(once you have mastered all of the exercises)you can go through it all without verbalization in a freeflowing atmosphere! A must have for your relaxation and inner strength building collection !,1148256000,4,346,4.948275862068965
8102843,5,B000DZ962K,I have been practicing Bradley's Qigong DVD for a couple of months now and it has made a major improvment in my stress levels and overall well being throughout the day. My body feels aligned & rejuvenated when i've finished the exercises. It has made a difference in my perception of situations that have made me tense or stressed in the past. It has also helped with physical pain I have had with my back. I like the colorful visualization techniques Bradley has you use with each exercise. I would recommend this video to anyone looking to help their body and spirit.,1139788800,2,569,4.588235294117647
8102844,5,B000DZ962K,"Secrets of the ancient Chinese longevity exercises that combine breath, movement, and imagination are revealed in beautiful clarity on this DVD. Thirteen Daoist Healing Qigong movements and one healing posture are demonstrated by Bradley Gilbert, who is a Master of Medical Qigong.

This one hour film can be viewed in its entirety, or individual exercises can be selected from the well-organized DVD menu. Bradley Gilbert explains the value of each exercise before demonstrating it, and each demonstration is presented with a woman's soothing voice providing methodical, thorough instructions.

I especially love the way that this DVD contains an eighteen minute long closing segment in which Bradley Gilbert demonstrates all thirteen healing movements and the healing posture with soothing music and a beautiful outdoor background of trees and hills.

This DVD is ideal for anyone seeking demonstrably better overall health, or for those desiring simple yet powerful techniques to bring healing to specific parts of their body.

The energy I feel during and after doing these exercises is nothing short of extraordinary; I can literally feel my body establishing optimal balance in every way. These exercises deliver exceptionally positive results while requiring only a moderate degree of flexibility and balance.

This no-impact workout is perfect for even the sick and elderly, who can go at their own pace. If you are seeking a simple way to improve every aspect of your health, I can think of nothing better than getting and utilizing  Bradley Gilbert's Daoist Healing Qigong DVD. I give it my very highest recommendation.",1137024000,10,1629,5.393700787401575
