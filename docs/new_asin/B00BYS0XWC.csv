5682846,5,B00BYS0XWC,"I've not given much attention to Jewel in the past, but I have given much attention to June Carter-Cash throughout her career.  I think Jewel did a superb job with an honest portrayal of June.  I think I like this movie better that Walk the Line.  If you're a younger person and know little about June, Johnny, and the Carter family, you might not get the full benefit of it.  However, it would still be an entertaining movie.",1372377600,,426,4.423076923076923
5682847,5,B00BYS0XWC,This was just 1 OF THE BEST MOVIES about a country singer that I've ever seen. I think what made RING OF FIRE so real was the fact that they went from age 5 until her death in 2003,1371686400,2,180,3.641025641025641

5682849,1,B00BYS0XWC,"Waste of money. Stick to ring of fire. This movie explains NOTHING. And the actors suck. It jumps around from scene to scene, she'll get married then it goes 4 years later, and it shows her seeing Johnny cash, THEN it jumps into 6 years later. It's ridiculous. Not good at all",1370995200,6,276,4.326923076923077
5682850,3,B00BYS0XWC,"I saw the Movie ..Lifetime. How does one compare this film with Walk the Line?

The only thing really enjoyable about the film was..

1..the music. Jewel does a nice rendition of Ring of Fire.
2..Jewel singing and guitar playing.
3...Jewel's presence. She is a beautiful girl....lots of personality..sexy.",1370736000,,305,5.204081632653061
5682851,4,B00BYS0XWC,"Wasn't too sure when I heard Jewel was in this role. However, she was pretty great and at least a few light years ahead of Reese Witherspoon as June in Walk The Line (there was NOTHING about Witherspoon to indicate she tried to mimic Carter; it was all about Reese.)

Jewell plays it innocently and attempts at all times to mime Carter's voice (both spoken and singing), inflections and character. I give her credit--when she is given lines with depth, she really tries, however:

The script had very awkward scenes/lines and little depth. This is what we expect from Lifetime. They don't know how to do movies that don't have women being stalked, raped and killed. Costumes were pretty cool though.

I would venture to guess the book, written by her son, is better.",1370390400,2,766,4.701492537313433
5682852,4,B00BYS0XWC,"I was really curious to see Jewel take on the iconic June Carter in this different take on her life and relationships before, and with Johnny.  I thought she showed great promise in the role, bringing emotional depth to a character who surely went through the proverbial ""ringer"" in her times with Cash.  The movie was touching without being schmaltzy, and in one scene in particular at the Betty Ford Clinic, Jewel really dug deep and displayed an acting ability that brought June's struggles directly to the heart.  For anyone who's grown up seeing a parent deal with the addiction of another, and all it entails, this scene will have particular resonance as June speaks to the isolation and anguish of constantly taking care of the other person, along with their children, whilst seemingly having nobody to rely upon to help tend to their own needs.  She reminded me of how much my own mother shouldered in dealing with my father's alcoholism when I was growing up.  The emotion I felt in that scene was quite unexpected, as I've seen this theme explored so many times on film without ever seeing someone really show the toll that it takes.  It made me want to pick up the phone and say ""thank you"" to Mom.

I only give the movie 4 stars due to the fact that it could--and should--have been longer.  I totally understand why they did it as a two hour movie, but it could really have benefitted from being extended an hour or two--perhaps as a two parter--to cover more ground and give the actors more breathing room to fully establish their characters attraction to one another.  I felt that the film really skimmed the surface of the connection between June and Johnny (a very credible Matt Ross), which left one to connect the dots without much help.  The actors had good chemistry, which helped, so it's a minor caveat.

Kudos to the wardrobe and set design departments as well for giving the look of the times just the right touch.  Jewel never looked more beautiful!  I rarely buy tv movies on dvd, but this one is a keeper.",1370217600,6,2032,4.595567867036011
5682853,3,B00BYS0XWC,"""I fell for you like a child, oh but the fire went wild."" June Carter (Jewel) is a member of country musics most famous family. After two failed marriages and a succesful music career she finally gives in and marries country's bad boy, Johnny Cash (Ross). She then starts her new life singing, playing, raising kids and trying to keep Johnny clean. Some prove more difficult then others. Just about everyone know the story of these two icons. I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and even though this was a Lifetime movie I was still looking forward to seeing it. I do have to admit that Jewel did a pretty good job of playing June in this but no where close to how good Reese Witherspoon was. As far as the guy playing Johnny Cash...it would have been hard to even come close to Joaquin Phoenix but this guy was just bad. His acting was OK, but he looked and sounded nothing like him. In fact the whole movie I thought the guy looks more like Merle Haggard then Johnny Cash. As far as the actual movie ""Walk The Line"" dealt with Cash's drug problems fairly harsh but also had the music mixed in. This movie is more of a bio-pic of June Carter, but it's pretty much her helping Johnny get sober over and over. I know it's Lifetime and it does show how strong June was, but after the third scene of her telling Johnny he has to stop it becomes very repetitive and really starts to lose some of the emotion. Do not be like me and go in expecting a Johnny Cash movie with music, that's not what this is. Overall, Jewel does a good job but this is nothing like I expected. I give it a B-.",1370044800,8,1575,4.201320132013201
5682854,5,B00BYS0XWC,This movie took the events in Walk the Line and went into detail without focusing entirely on the drugs. June Carter Cash is one of the greatest country legends of all time. It was her strength and belief in God that kept John R. Cash alive. This movie focuses on her life before Johnny. The second half of the movie focuses on one of the most amazing love stories ever. I highly recommend this movie because it told her story better than some of the other movies. The book Anchored in Love by their son John Carter Cash is a perfect companion to this movie. Ring of Fire was based off of Anchored in Love.,1369612800,11,606,4.278260869565218
5682855,4,B00BYS0XWC,"Just finished watching the film's premiere on the Lifetime network and overall I really enjoyed it and was very touched at times throughout it.  Walk the Line was a great movie but it was focused on Johnny Cash.  June deserved her focus too, especially considering how much Walk the Line left out the couple's struggles with Johnny's addictions from the mid 1960s into the 1980s.  I didn't necessarily buy into Jewel as June Carter Cash as much as I did Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, but I thought overall she did a good acting job.  I thought Matt Ross was very compelling as Johnny.  Two things I really liked about the movie was the emphasis on the Carter Family repertoire and the final scene based on Miss Carter's final recording session for the album ""Press On"" which I own and listen to often.  Far Side Banks of Jordan was particularly touching. I would recommend the movie for any June Carter, Johnny Cash or country music fan.",1369612800,16,943,4.616766467065868

5682861,5,B00BYS0XWC,Jewel Kilcher did an excellent job in the role of June Carter. I enjoyed most of the music. Whoever sang Johnny Cash's part could have done a better job.  Whoever sang June's part did an excellent job.  It was an enjoyable movie.,1475798400,,229,4.428571428571429

5682866,5,B00BYS0XWC,I like this movie more then Walk The Line. Both actors played June and Cash beautifully.,1467072000,,88,4.5625
5682867,3,B00BYS0XWC,"Ring of Fire is an attempt to highlight the life and career of June Carter. In many ways it does, however, as an entertainment vehicle theres not much spark.

The movie begins by showing the early days of the Carter family and includes many songs written by AP (I guess those copyrights are cheaper and easier to obtain; you won't hear any of Johnnys songs and Ring of Fire is the only Carter/Cash song youll hear).  Its a good representation of early hillbilly music and how it was performed. From the Carter family days, the movie presents different episodes in Junes life, concluding with her death. I personally learned more about her family life, marriages, as well as Johnnys marriages and his use of drugs.

Though the episodes may present insightful information about their lives, the portrayals are subdued and staid, and sometimes the pacing is awkward. Jewel does a fine job with the material she was given. However, June was a much more extroverted, sassy, kinetic person and those characteristics are not consistently portrayed. With that said, Jewel should definitely continue acting, and hopefully shell find more parts (she has a particularly good scene with Johnnys drug counselor where her acting skills really shine  pun intended). As for Johnnys portrayal, no offense to Matt Ross, but he looks more like the character Data on Star Trek: the Next Generation than he does Johnny.  Related, to include Johnny Cashs character in any project it would be wise to find a singer who actually sounds like him. One other knit-picky observation; I realize a good portion of the project was filmed in Georgia, but could the production company have at least filmed at the real Ryman Auditorium?

Carter and Cash fans will no doubt embrace this movie. To the casual fan it's worth a viewing to learn more about them.  Maybe someday well see a big screen, big budget adaption of Junes life.",1465948800,2,1896,4.869565217391305
5682868,5,B00BYS0XWC,"Okay, the story is really fast through the early years, but it gives us what we need for understanding ""June-bug's"" back story. I found the actor that played Johnny to be rather stiff at times and jewel did a valiant job of acting and great job of singing..
I am old enough to remember these years. June was about 12 years older than I and my family was a fan of country.
Written by their son, this memoir is sad and happy; tragic and redemptive. I short my husband and I loved it. The 5 stars are for how the movie made us feel and after all, isn't that why we watch movies ( biographies).",1465516800,,590,4.139130434782609

June may be most credited for writing Johnny Cash's most famous song, that also her and the Carters made famous. ""Ring of Fire"" the movie, tells the tale about love and endurance and the struggles of this family; their trials and tests. RING OF FIRE adds in events where WALK THE LINE left off.

Her father, Ezra, was a very stongwilled man in his own right, as was her Mother, Maybelle. This film shows the humanness of stars of a huge magnitude, yet it also shows how they handle the problems that they face with resilience and determination. There were times when watching Jewel perform, that I could actually catch glimpses here and there of June Carter Cash. I did not personally care for the actor that portrayed John; his performance kind of fell flat. The early scenes with the sisters were right on queue. It was always acknowledged that Helen was the smart one who knew everything, so in a way she was relegated to status of a nerd. Anita had the voice and the beauty and June had no skills early on, until she developed her comedy routine and keen business sense. I was very satisfied with Mother Maybelle's portrayal. She was the rock that kept EVERYONE together and when she finally decided to quit performing, caused a tremendous amount of upheaval in the organization.

5682923,5,B00BYS0XWC,The most awesome service and quality...8) love it.....definitely will use again....and again and again....thanks again....over and over again...most definitely again....,1392422400,,169,7.5
5682924,3,B00BYS0XWC,Good movie. Disappointed with music. Instruments louder than vocals.,1391212800,,68,6.666666666666667
5682925,5,B00BYS0XWC,"Enjoyed the movie, I have seen Walk the Line as well and enjoyed it. This movie focuses on June Carter where Walk the Line was about Johnny. Both excellent movies.",1389484800,,163,4.466666666666667
5682926,5,B00BYS0XWC,"This movie was a great!  We got to see June's side of the relationship.  I also watched Walk the Line, and the stories matched up really good.",1389312000,,142,4.222222222222222
5682927,5,B00BYS0XWC,My wife and I watched it together and loved the movie with her favorite singer of all time starring in the awesome performance she gave!!!!,1388188800,,139,4.6
5682928,4,B00BYS0XWC,"We enjoyed the singing. Jewel was wonderful and the guy who played Johnny Cash was only mediocre - but then, Johnny sets a pretty high bar. Some of the songs they did together were excellent.",1388016000,,191,4.485714285714286
5682929,1,B00BYS0XWC,Ring of Fire was very similar to Walk the Line with Joaquin Rivers. This movie was also disappointing because the actors were all not believable- lousy! Sadly this movie was a waste of time and money.,1387497600,,200,4.583333333333333
5682930,4,B00BYS0XWC,"I did not know what to expect when going into this film. In a way, the thought of another Johnny Cash biopic seems kinda unnecessary in the wake of a brilliant film like ""Walk The Line.""

But don't be mistaken: this is not a Johnny biopic. June (played by the 90's alternative folk singer, Jewel) is the star of this show.

I highly recommend this film to those that enjoy biopic films and music (in general). You'll be pleasantly surprised by Jewel's performance as June Carter. As much as I love Witherspoon--in general and in Walk The Line--in some regards, Jewel's ""June Carter"" feels a bit more authentic to me.

This is definitely well worth a viewing.",1387065600,,658,4.6068376068376065
5682931,5,B00BYS0XWC,Very Good story hearing it from 'her' side.  Though we enjoyed 'his' side better probably because it had more singing!,1386547200,,118,4.9
5682932,5,B00BYS0XWC,"buy it you will love it, this is music at its best, you won't get burned out listen to this great cd, thanks again amazon",1383004800,,121,3.88
5682933,5,B00BYS0XWC,I will keep on watching over and over again and not stop until my dvd player dies. its the best,1380672000,,95,3.8
5682934,5,B00BYS0XWC,This movie was great! Jewel did a great job!! She is a wonderful and beautiful singer and actress!! Awesome and great!,1380672000,,118,4.666666666666667
5682935,5,B00BYS0XWC,"I saw this on TV and was astonished that it seemed to be a made-for-TV movie.  It was one of the best ""Carter/Cash"" movies I've ever seen and bought it as a gift for someone who loved it just as much as I.",1380326400,2,205,3.7674418604651163
5682936,2,B00BYS0XWC,"Although Jewel was pretty convincing as June Carter,  the movie was slow and pretty dry.  It wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.",1379548800,,131,4.2
5682937,4,B00BYS0XWC,"Thanks to Amazon for this fats delivery! (faster than some i did in France!)
Concerning the DVD itself, there are some mistakes between the true story and the movie but it's a very pleasant movie, Jewel is awesome in June's character and a lovley voice ( near from the real June's voice) It's a good think to watch this movie and ""Walk the line""",1378771200,,345,4.40625
5682938,2,B00BYS0XWC,"I know most of the Johnny Cash and Carter family history,  and I believe the movie is poorly done.  I think they could of found a better actor for JR Cash.  But if you want basic history that is somewhat true then I guess it might be an ok movie.",1378425600,2,246,3.88
5682939,4,B00BYS0XWC,"This movie did a good job of filling in the gaps from ""Walk the Line."" I just don't feel like the casting was that good. I love Jewel but she wasn't really convincing as June until almost the end of the movie when she played ""old"" June. They casted an average looking guy to play Cash so as not to take away from June (this was ""her"" story after all). It wasn't a bad film. Worth a look.",1377648000,2,387,3.9743589743589745
5682940,5,B00BYS0XWC,While good much of the story was the same as in the Johnny Cash Ring of Fire DVD Would have been better if more on Junes earlier life and husbands,1377561600,,146,3.9
5682941,5,B00BYS0XWC,I had seen this movie on Lifetime and really enjoyed it.  I was hoping it would come around so I could watch it but never did catch it.  I was very happy to find it on Amazon!  I love the story and love the music.  Definitely a keeper!,1376524800,3,235,3.8333333333333335
5682942,3,B00BYS0XWC,I thought this movie was ok it wasn't nothing fabulous. I like the singing in it but the acting wasn't that great.,1376352000,,114,4.2272727272727275
5682943,5,B00BYS0XWC,"Loved the story of June's life, but the actor protraying Johnny did a lousey job.  The make-up artist did a terrible job on all the characters.  Mother Maybelle looked nothing like the actress protraying her and June's character looked nothing like her.",1376092800,2,253,5.0
5682944,4,B00BYS0XWC,"June Carter Cash is more than important enough to deserve her own movie.  The Carter Family is fascinating in their own right and this movie does a good job of telling their tale as well.  Great music, great story, great drama.",1375833600,,227,4.512195121951219
5682945,5,B00BYS0XWC,John and June were two of my favorite country couples.  This movie is a great portrayal of them both. I highly recommend it.,1375574400,2,124,4.391304347826087

5682947,5,B00BYS0XWC,"I saw this on TV and love it!  I AM NOT a country and western fan, but Jewel's performance was stunning.  I bought an extra copy to give as a gift for Christmas!  I love Jewel anyway, and, this was a role made for her!  Touching film.",1375228800,,234,3.9148936170212765
5682948,4,B00BYS0XWC,"I really liked the movie Walk the Line and was interested to see what the story would be from the perspective of June. I think the acting was good, for a made for TV movie. I was pleasantly surprised with how sweet this film was.  It portrayed Johnny in a more realistic light by including recovery issues. I did watch this twice, so I would recommend.",1374364800,,352,4.333333333333333
5682949,4,B00BYS0XWC,Interesting movie about June Carter with Johnny Cash as a supporting character.  Nice to see from her point of view what it was like living with Johnny Cash.  Jewel was absolutely amazing in her performance.  Many scenes showing her on stage really captured June Carter.  Saw the TV movie and liked it so much I bought it.,1374364800,,322,4.5964912280701755
5682950,2,B00BYS0XWC,"musically great,  acting iffy, and story line with all the juicy bits is thin.  Was hoping this would shed more light on the intricacies of what happened. It didn't reveal much , and this was disappointing!",1374364800,,206,4.694444444444445
5682951,4,B00BYS0XWC,"While her own talent/fame was squelched by her husband's, June Carter demonstrated a lot of love and endurance trying to keep her man away from the drugs he was addicted to. I think the movie captures that well.",1374019200,,211,4.578947368421052
5682952,5,B00BYS0XWC,"I'm a resident of Alaska so naturally I'm a fan of Jewel who grew up on a homestead maybe 20 miles from where I used to live. No I didn't know her though, she left Alaska before I moved here. Now about the movie..... Jewel played June Carter Cash to perfection. In every photo or recorded video of her June always had a big grin showing a lot of teeth. As often as that happened in public I suspect that was just her way. Jewel had the big grin and the silly side just like June. She sounded quite a bit like her too. I suspect she used the lower tones in her own voice but haven't checked the credits to confirm that. The fellow portraying Johnny did a super job too. Wish it had come out in Blu-ray but bought the DVD anyway and I'm glad I did, well worth it.",1373587200,2,761,4.0131578947368425
5682953,5,B00BYS0XWC,"This is truly one of the most beautiful movie ever made. Jewel plays June Carter Cash and shows her in a light that I don't think a lot of people have had the chance to see before. I find it hard to sit through an entire movie, but I was glued to my seat for the entire movie! Highly recommend.",1372550400,2,294,3.9166666666666665
