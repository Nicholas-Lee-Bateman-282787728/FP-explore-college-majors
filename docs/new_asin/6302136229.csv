429406,5,6302136229,"This review applies EQUALLY to Orchestra Wives and Sun Valley Serenade.
Remember the Elvis movies that were basically a thin plot excuse to have the ""star"" sing?  Well these movies are the 1940's equivalent featuring the pre-war (and so definitive) Glenn Miller Band.
Forget about the plots which are almost identical and don't even stand up today.  Boy meets Girl, Falls in love, Another girl is jilted or gets in the way, disharmony in the band, all is sorted out.  Big set piece number to finish.  (Both movies - honest!).  In fact unless you are interested in period movie making and Hollywood fashions you can safely fast forward between the tunes.  You can figure the plot as it whizzes by - though how Milton Berle (playing the band's ""publicity agent"" in Sun Valley Serenade) got his wise crack about the size of a girl's chest past the production code is beyond me!  Must have been the war.
BUT - the real reason to own these tapes (when are we going to get the DVD versions?) is watching the mechanics of how the Miller Band produced the sound.  Sure - it was shot to be showy - and it is - but it is WELL shot and you can see how the components of the sound were built - even if the ""recording studios"" are the size of movie studios......  Couple this with the restored soundtrack (some tracks are in early stereo!) and you have a reason to own these movies.  If you can only afford one - Orchestra Wives - there are more hits on it!",1086652800,30,1444,4.394736842105263
429407,4,6302136229,"This light romantic comedy is one of only two feature films to include Glenn Miller and his big band (the other being the superior ""Orchestra Wives"")... Miller himself is stiff as a board onscreen, and his acting parts are entirely unmemorable, although the musical performances are stellar.  The orchestra's highly choreographed stage routines translate well onto film, and the visual razzle-dazzle of Miller's well-honed showmanship gives this film its real sizzle.  Tex Beneke shines on a hep vocal update of ""Chattanooga Choo-Choo,"" a number which closes with some singing and hoofing by the ever-acrobatic Nicholas Brothers, as well as actress Dorothy Dandridge, who sort of appears out of nowhere, just to take a brief solo.  The plot is simple enough: actor John Payne stars as Ted Scott, a featured performer in Miller's (supposedly) struggling band, gets caught between two gals, Lynn Bari's tempremental big band diva, and Sonja Henie, as a perky war refugee from Norway.  (War refugee?  Norway??  Oh, never mind...)  As ever, Henie's appeal may be lost on some; personally, I find her incredibly vapid, and her giant, phony smile is somewhat disturbing.  That being said, this is actually one of her better performances, and Payne is a very likable leading man.  The film is padded out with extensive skiing sequences and plenty of Henie-delic skating scenes, so the fast-forward button may come in handy.  Milton Berle also has a big role as the band's fast-talking, nebbishy business manager -- a surprisingly nonabrasive early performance in the late, great comedian's decades-long career.  All in all, a nice bit of pre-war American fluff.  A must-see for Glenn Miller fans.",1085097600,6,1689,5.214814814814815
429408,5,6302136229,"If you want to see Glen Miller leading his orchestra and hear the original music plus see the orchestra perform...this is it.
It brought tears to my eyes to see the orchestra that I had been
reading about. I feel the loss and tragedy of Glenn's death at such an early age and at the height of his career. The men and women that performed are on their way to their own deaths or have
already died due to the 1941 time frame of this movie. This is a valuable video because it's an important piece of history. I believe Glenn wanted us to see the orchestra in an accurate way.",1078185600,6,573,4.171171171171171
429409,5,6302136229,"If you can not find the time or money to find yourself in the secluded town of Ketchum/Sun Valley, Idaho this winter. I say settle down with this classic film and enjoy the view.  Sun Valley has never looked so beautiful as what one will find in this movie, astonishing since so little of it was actually filmed in the Grand Dame of Ski Resorts.  Sun Valley is truly a magical land and this movie only enhances its glamour with great performances from Sonja Henie, John Payne, and Glenn Miller.  Oh did I forget to mention the music composed for this movie?  Chatanooga Choo Choo, I Know Why and So Do You, It Happened in Sun Valley-Harry Warrens worked his fingers off writing all of this music.  Remember Sun Valley Serenade is in no way movie making at its finest moment.  What it does accomplish is similar to what the resort accomplishes; it takes you away to a destination far from the cries of urban life and allows you to relax and remember more simple times.",982108800,39,967,4.465909090909091

429548,5,6302136229,"This very agreeable romantic musical comedy from 1941 links two seemingly incompatible elements, both very popular at the time it was filmed: Sonja Henie's ice skating and Glenn Miller's big band jazz. It's admittedly fluffy, but is also very hard to dislike.

The slim plot of sorts: Ted (John Payne), a pianist in a struggling jazz big band headed by Glenn Miller (though he is given another name here), has volunteered for publicity reasons to take a refugee from war torn Norway. He expects to get a small child, but she gets the grown, beautiful Karen Benson (Sonja Henie). Karen is too eager to get involved romantically with Ted, the problem is he already has a girlfriend, the temperamental Viv (played by Lynn Bari), who is also a singer with the band. Henie's character is just short of grating - we are supposed to find her a sympathetic character, and mostly we do, even as she tries to steal a man from other woman. When Ted and Viv go to the ski resort of Sun Valley for a performance there in the middle of the winter, Karen decides to join them hiding in the train with the help of the band manager (Milton Berle).

Of course more than the plot, the important thing here is the music (In the Mood and Chattanooga Choo Choo are some of the pieces included) and Henie's skating. There is also a nifty prolonged scene of Henie pursuing Payne in skis (even if the close ups were obviously filmed in studios, and doubles were used in distant shots).",1439683200,,1460,4.547528517110266

429701,4,6302136229,"My sexy, boasty co-worker once muttered, ""You either have 'it' or you don't."" I think she was referring to sex appeal, although at the time she was at the vending machine, rifling thru her purse for a quarter. Sonja Henie and the phrase ""consummate thespian"" won't ever bump into each other in a dark room, but Sonja Henie generates that ""it"" quality. So them acting skills can go take a bunk. 20th Century Fox's 1941 breezy musical, Sun Valley Serenade, presents her as the feature attraction, although, okay, Glenn Miller and his orchestra don't exactly wilt like lilies.

Milton Berle is the brash publicity manager, and the plot revolves around one of his c0ckamamie stunts coming home to roost. A while back, to drum up publicity, he had the band put in the paperwork to sponsor a Norwegian refugee. Bad cess to the band's pianist, Ted Scott (John Payne), that he was the only cat with a fountain pen. Today, Glenn Miller (as ""Phil Corey"") and his music-makers have just lucked into a gig at the celebrated winter resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, thanks mostly to Ted's knack for creating sparks with the house canary, Vivien Dawn (Lynn Bari). But then, to gum up the works, that old publicity stunt resurfaces in the shape of a subpoena from the Immigration Department. Off go Ted and the gang to collect their little war refugee. Except that lovely Karen Benson (Henie) turns out to be a far cry from Ted's assumption of an orphan child.

Sit back; there's much to like about this. It's got this good-natured vibe, never mind that house canary Vivien Dawn soon finds herself playing the shabby side of a romantic triangle. There was a time when, thanks to my dad, I really got into big band music, and Glenn Miller was in the forefront of that wave. Sucks that he and his orchestra were featured prominently in only two feature films, this one and Orchestra Wives (1942). Maybe you have to be old school to enjoy the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Or maybe you just have to like good music. The boys set the room to jumpin' with a lively rendition of ""In the Mood."" ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" earned an Oscar nomination for Best Song. John Payne got to croon ""I Know Why (And So Do You).""

And, yeah, manly man me, there was a time when I got into figure skating for some years. It started when that whole Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding fiasco went down. We'll never know if Sonja Henie was capable of executing a triple salchow or a triple lutz, the sheer ambition of those moves being decades ahead of her era. Interestingly, it took me a minute to appreciate Sonja Henie when she's on skates, took me a bit to recognize her grace on ice. But it's when she's in her very own element. In her era, she owned the rink, just as Esther Williams owned the pool. Naturally, her skating is incorporated into Glenn Miller's big band routine. Naturally, it puts the band over the top. Smiles all around (except possibly from house canary Vivien Dawn).

In cinema, Sonja Henie was a niche performer, her and Esther Williams. But Sonja was so smart about it. She parlayed her cheerful charisma and her multiple Olympic titles into eleven diverting motion pictures, with her debut picture, One in a Million (1936), being my favorite. There was a time when she was one of the ten wealthiest women in the world. Think of her films as comfort food. You won't ever get thrown for a swerve when it comes to plot, so there's that. But there's something satisfying in watching Sonja Henie in a movie. And, in this one, you're also treated to specialty numbers by the Nicholas Brothers and Dorothy Dandridge. And for Fred Astaire fans, his frequent collaborator, Hermes Pan, staged the dances.",1390003200,,3665,4.6425269645608624
429702,5,6302136229,"The DVD Contains Highly Offensive Material

After BUYING and PAYING for this DVD set I discovered that........

When the DVD first starts to play you are FORCED to watch a video describing that it is wrong to copy a movie. The video depicts various types of theft with nasty heavy metal music.  The ability to press the menu button (and have it work) is disabled by the authors of the DVD.

This would be no different than if you sat down at a table in a restaurant and the waiter came up and lectured you in harsh terms, about the immorality of skipping out on the check and not paying.

In reading the other reviews, I am shocked to see so many people purchasing old-fashioned Region 1 (R1) only DVD players.

There are thousands of wonderful movies not produced for the USA market.  A sad fact, but true.  ""Sun Valley Serenade"" is one such movie. The next time you are shopping for a DVD player only purchase one that is multi-region.  They're available from many manufacturers.  Most of these will play NTSC and PAL formats.

The whole concept of having various regions for DVDs is a stupid idea.  Hollywood's paranoia with movie copying adds to the pain of the millions of movie fans all over the world.",1387929600,5,1208,4.516129032258065

And we cannot forget the sparkling presence of Sonja Henie, the great Norwegian figure skater star of the 40's.  All it needs is for it to be released in a Region one (1) version.

429827,4,6302136229,"SUN VALLEY SERENADE, released by Twentieth Century-Fox in 1941, was the first musical especially tailored as a showcase for the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Olympic iceskating champ Sonja Henie is also beautifully used here.

The plot revolves around an up-and-coming jazzband called The Dartmouth Troubadours, who are booked into a prime engagement at a Sun Valley ski resort. Things are complicated when piano player Ted Scott (John Payne), is suddenly lumbered with a pretty Norwegian war refugee, Karen Benson (Sonja Henie). Karen's arrival causes friction with Ted's girlfriend--and resident singer of the Troubadours--Vivian Dawn (played by Lynn Bari).

The delightfully-thin plot bubbles away very nicely, allowing us to see and hear some classic Glenn Miller standards (""Chattanooga Choo Choo"", ""I Know Why"", ""In the Mood""); and Sonja Henie is prettily-showcased in several iceskating routines. And yes, that's a very young Dorothy Dandridge dancing the speciality of ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" with the Nicholas Brothers.

Henie's performance is the main reason why the story of the film works so well. She's an instantly-likeable actress here, with her soft beauty and innocent character. You just want to put her in your pocket! John Payne and Lynn Bari are well-paired; and Milton Berle puts in a fun performance as the band manager ""Nifty"" Allen.

Glenn Miller would be reunited with many of the same cast (including Lynn Bari, and The Nicholas Brothers), for ""Orchestra Wives"" the following year.",1242172800,2,1502,5.4334763948497855

Yet, after all these years, still not available in the USA. I've had my request in for a long time but don't ever expect to see it in this country. I'll buy it in the UK when I get back across the pond for a short spell.

429906,4,6302136229,"I've had this one & Orchestra Wives for many years taped off AMC before they started running commercials during the movies. Both are really great movies however I'm writing about Sun Valley Serenade this time. The best stereo is during In The Mood & most of Chattanooga Choo Choo. All the rest could have been mixed better. I really like when Chattanooga Choo Choo starts the bandleader says ""one, two"" in mono then the music begins in full stereo. I love when it does that!!

If they put this out on DVD I hope they try to mix the stereo music tracks better as some of it doesn't sound like stereo should and sounds a bit fake to my ears. The going back & forth from mono to stereo and back again sounds a bit strange but you get used to it. It's better on speakers than headphones though as some of the sound is unnatural sounding with headphone listening.

The movie itself is great just like Orchestra Wives is. Oh & the ice skating parts, wow I really like that. I'll get Orchestra Wives on DVD & if this movie is ever released that way then I'm buying it too.",1201219200,4,1065,4.293532338308458

One irony about the movie is that about that time Sonja Henie trashed her reputation in Norway by declining to participate in fundraising for the Norwegian resistance/government-in-exile.",1197504000,3,424,4.767123287671233
429908,4,6302136229,"SUN VALLEY SERENADE, released by Twentieth Century-Fox in 1941, was the first musical especially tailored as a showcase for the Glenn Miller Orchestra.  Olympic iceskating champ Sonja Henie is also beautifully used here.

The plot revolves around an up-and-coming jazzband called The Dartmouth Troubadours, who are booked into a prime engagement at a Sun Valley ski resort.  Things are complicated when piano player Ted Scott (John Payne), is suddenly lumbered with a pretty Norwegian war refugee, Karen Benson (Sonja Henie).  Karen's arrival causes friction with Ted's girlfriend--and resident singer of the Troubadours--Vivian Dawn (played by Lynn Bari).

The delightfully-thin plot bubbles away very nicely, allowing us to see and hear some classic Glenn Miller standards (""Chattanooga Choo Choo"", ""I Know Why"", ""In the Mood""); and Sonja Henie is prettily-showcased in several iceskating routines.  And yes, that's a very young Dorothy Dandridge dancing the speciality of ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" with the Nicholas Brothers.

Henie's performance is the main reason why the story of the film works so well.  She's an instantly-likeable actress here, with her soft beauty and innocent character.  You just want to put her in your pocket!  John Payne and Lynn Bari are also well-paired.  Milton Berle also puts in a fun performance as the band manager ""Nifty"" Allen.

Glenn Miller would be reunited with many of the same cast (including Lynn Bari, and The Nicholas Brothers), for ""Orchestra Wives"" the following year.

SUN VALLEY SERENADE has now received DVD releases in the UK and Australia, so hopefully a domestic release is not too far away.",1178841600,6,1645,5.35408560311284
429909,5,6302136229,"Unfortunately, as I write this I cannot and have not read the other 20+ reviews about this movie so forgive me if I'm repeating anything here.  I just want to say that the musical numbers turn into true stereo sound as opposed to the mono track that contains the dialogue.  I discovered this while watching a presentation of the film on the AMC channel a few years ago.  Since I'm a big fan of early experiments in movie stereo sound, I was stunned and delighted when I heard the musical numbers suddenly switch to the stereo sound that's also very hi-fi for its time (1941).  Fortunately, I was recording it onto Super VHS tape and still have that copy along with a new commercial VHS release I acquired sometime later.  A stereo CD of the Glenn Miller performances was released from this film some time ago without giving credit to the movie as it's source.

Crisp Black & White footage that is RAZOR SHARP, excellent Swing Music by the Worlds GREATEST Swing Band EVER, and filed with a TRUE STEREOPHONIC High Fidelity Sound Track so you get to hear the GREAT Glenn Miller Swing Band in Full TRUE Stereo. Optical Angle Sound Tracks were used to create the MASTER FILM of this movie and from that a TRUE Stereo Sound track is created that was also in vivid clean High Fidelity with a 30-15,000 Hz Fequency Response thanks to optical sound's great quality and ultra low noise and low distortion.  This movie sound track sounds as good as if it was recorded on a CD yesterday.  And listen to it in Dolby Surround by using your Home Theater's Dolby Pro-Logic IIx decoding setting and you will hear this SUPER Stereo Recording in 5.1 channel Dolby Surround.  It weas recorded using the highest fidelity microphones ever made in the 1940s, the RCA ""Skunk"" ribbon velocity boom mics and the RCA 44-A and 44-B Ribbon Velocity Microphones that captured the full high fidelity range of 30-15,000 hz perfectly.  All in all theis is a sonic spectacular fully equal to any modern day movie sound track and yet it was recorded in 1941 with the most advanced optical audio recording equipment available.  You'll LOVE thi9s one on your home theater.  It's one of two films that Glemm Miller did in Hollywood in the early 1940s with his famous Swing Band and all their popular top hit recordings are featured, sounding better than ever before.

I lost interest in Glenn and the big-band era for a while, when a group called The Beatles came over from Liverpool and changed my life musically, but rediscovered Glenn in the late '70s and '80s, when my musical tastes became more adult.

Glenn Miller And His Orchestra made only two movies, both for Twentieth Century-Fox. In 2005, I purchased the second one, 1942's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orchestra-Wives/dp/B000AP04LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orchestra Wives</a>, at Tower Records. I enjoyed the film immensely, but much to my chagrin, discovered that the band's first film, SUN VALLEY SERENADE, which I had seen on TV years ago, was only available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS-tape/dp/6302136229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS tape</a>. For some reason, Fox only issued the DVD version in Region 2 (Japanese/European/South African/Middle Eastern) format, and not in a Region 1 U.S.-compatible version, which meant that I could not enjoy SUN VALLEY SERENADE on DVD.

Now that I have my new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-Multi-Zone-Region-Free-Blu-Ray-Player/dp/B00VPGS1J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony Multi Zone Region Free Blu Ray Player</a>, I finally purchased the Region 2 DVD, originally released in 2007, and reissued (with different cover art) in 2012. in the film, Glenn Miller plays struggling bandleader Phil Corey (a better alias than Gene Morrison, Glenn's character in ORCHESTRA WIVES), who is trying to get a break for his band, The Dartmouth Troubadours. The band's pianist and arranger, Ted Scott (John Payne), is in love with the band's new girl singer, Vivian Dawn (Lynn Bari, whose singing voice is dubbed by Pat Friday, even though Bari was a singer herself), but complications arise when the band's manager, ""Nifty"" Allen (Milton Berle), forces Scott to sponsor a foreign refugee as a publicity gimmick. Thinking he was going to sponsor a young child, Scott is shocked when the refugee turns out to be a young woman from Norway, Karen Benson (Sonja Henie), who is seeking a husband, and immediately begins pursuing Ted Scott. Ted resists Karen's advances, but she follows him everywhere, from band rehearsals to the ski resort where the band was booked. When Ted gets engaged to Vivian, Karen temporarily hooks up with band manager Allen, but in the end, finally wins over Ted (after Vivian breaks off the engagement) and marries him.

Glenn Miller's band is in top form. The songs include the poignant ""I Know Why (And So Do You),"" which is one of my favorite Miller songs; a new version of the hit ""In The Mood,"" which is superior to the original 1939 RCA Victor 78 RPM record release; and novelty numbers, such as ""The Kiss Polka"" and ""It Happened In Sun Valley."" Other numbers recorded for the picture, including ""Sun Valley Jump"" and the classic ""At Last,"" did not make the final cut, though instrumental interludes of ""At Last"" do appear briefly. The big production number, ""Chattanooga Choo Choo,"" much longer than the record, is the highlight of the film, with a fabulous performance by the band (including singers Tex Beneke, Paula Kelly, and The Modernaires), and a great song-and-dance number by Dorothy Dandridge and The Nicholas Brothers (who were under contract to Fox at the time and are credited in the film; Dorothy Dandridge is not credited).

HISTORICAL NOTE: The Nicholas Brothers also appear in ORCHESTRA WIVES, doing another great dance number to the ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" sequel song, ""(I've Got A Gal In) Kalamazoo,"" but Dorothy Dandridge does not appear with them.

In the 1999 HBO movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Introducing-Dorothy-Dandridge/dp/B003HKN534/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Introducing Dorothy Dandridge</a>, the ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" dance scene is briefly recreated by Halle Berry (who plays Dorothy), Obba Babatund (Harold Nicholas, who the real-life Dandridge would eventually marry), and Darrian C. Ford (Fayard Nicholas). Unfortunately, the dance sequence only lasts about 45 seconds, so if you blink, you'll miss it. Poor Halle - she took three months of intense tap lessons for that film, and all she got was a lousy 45-second tap sequence. Unless she tap-dances for fun and/or exercise, Halle probably hasn't worn those tap shoes since that movie was made nearly 20 years ago.

Overall, I liked SUN VALLEY SERENADE better than ORCHESTRA WIVES. The plot is fast-moving, and the skiing and figure-skating scenes, filmed on location at Sun Valley, Idaho, are beautifully done. Sonja Henie does most of the figure skating herself, but stand-ins were used for the skiing scenes. The only bonus feature on the DVD is the theatrical trailer. In contrast, the ORCHESTRA WIVES DVD, which I watched again recently, has a commentary track by actors Fayard Nicholas and Ann Rutherford (which was made in 2005, when the DVD was issued; Nicholas died in 2006, his brother Harold passed away in 2000, and Rutherford died in 2012), the theatrical trailer, a stereo soundtrack, a photo gallery, and several promos for other 20th Century-Fox films.

HISTORICAL NOTE: Some of the film's songs may have been recorded with another female vocalist, Lorraine Elliott, but Pat Friday does the actual singing in the film (though the Elliott versions, if they exist, may have been issued on vinyl in the '50s by either RCA Victor or 20th-Fox Records).

There is a Blu-ray version of this film, released in Spain as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tu-Seras-Mi-Marido/dp/B017QLIOLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tu Seras Mi Marido</a>, which translates into English as ""You Will Be My Husband,"" but it may not be worth the risk.

In 1986, Mercury Records released a partial CD of Glenn's film scores,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glenn-Miller-in-Hollywood/dp/B000008BR7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glenn Miller in Hollywood</a>, which I used to own. Although there is probably not enough demand for it, I'd love to see Sony Legacy (RCA) and Universal Music (which owns the 20th Century-Fox music library), get together with the Miller Estate and issue a complete collection of all of the music from both of Glenn's films, including outtakes and rejected songs.
