Who ever copyed this has no skills at all. you can barely see Al Green face nor the musinans faces or the audiance. Amazon need take it off the market and return everyone money who purchased this dvd at almost $17.00. If anything ever turned me off it was this dvd. I've gotten ones from other countries that were clearer than this tape. I am way beyond disappointed. Amazon could lose my business behind this one. Please don't waste your money because there nothing I can say good about it. If I would give it no stars I would.",1401494400,11,628,4.241666666666666
