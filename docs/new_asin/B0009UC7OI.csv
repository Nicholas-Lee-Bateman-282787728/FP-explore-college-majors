2319822,5,B0009UC7OI,"I must first get something out of the way: another reviewer stated that this 5th season is ""the last season of I Love Lucy."" No. I Love Lucy had six seasons (they moved to Connecticut in the the 6th), followed by 3 seasons of the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (though each season was quite short). Okay, with that out of the way... This season is fantastic! The Ricardos and Mertz's are still in Hollywood when the season opens, they return to New York, then go to Europe for the rest of the season. Some of the best episodes of the sitcom's (and television's) history are included in season 5. It's so interesting to look back and note how television didn't have to resort to season cliff-hangers and shocking season premieres to gain an audience back then! (You'd never see a modern sitcom just leave with the character in the middle of a trip to L.A. and return the next season as if it was the next week!) I Love Lucy was a special show that still stands the test of time.",1118793600,26,968,4.383333333333334
2319823,5,B0009UC7OI,"As with most classic TV shows (Andy Griffith, The Honeymooners, The Twilight Zone) we were bombarded with many low-quality and incomplete DVDs of I Love Lucy, but now it is getting the treatment it deserves. Not only to the episodes in this series absolutely pristine and more clear than they ever looked on TV or other DVDs, there is a wealth of special features. I only wish that Andy Griffith and Universal's properties (The Munsters, Night Gallery, etc.) were handled this well.

Although the extras look a bit slimer on this release than on previous seasons, it is still a very impressive list for something of this age. Of course, even if there were no extras, it would be enough to have all the episodes together forever, but how cool is it to see deleted scenes and alternate versions of scenes in the episodes? I believe that Lucille Ball's family has some hand in these releases, as with the very well-done (albeit incomplete) release of ""Here's Lucy"". This is very fortunate, because they have clearly taken great care with the show.

Season five consists of these classic episodes:

Lucy Visits Grauman's

Lucy and John Wayne

Lucy and the Dummy

Ricky Sells the Car

The Great Train Robbery

Homecoming

The Richardos are Interviewed

Lucy Goes to a Rodeo

Nursery School

Ricky's European Booking

The Passports

Staten Island Ferry

Bon Voyage

Second Honeymoon

Lucy Meets the Queen

The Fox Hunt

Lucy Goes to Scotland

Paris at Last!

Lucy Meets Charles Boyer

Lucy Gets a Paris Gown

Lucy in the Swiss Alps

Lucy Gets Homesick in Italy

Lucy's Italian Movie

Lucy's Bicycle Trip

Lucy Goes to Monte Carlo

Return Home from Europe

As you can see from the list, there were a lot of story arcs and traveling in this season. Some of the funniest episodes involve Lucy in a foreign locale, in a fish out of water fashion.

This set concludes the ""I Love Lucy"" collection, but hopefully ""The Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour"" (pretty much the same show in an hour-long format) will be released soon. So far, this series (after a shaky disc-by-disc release of season one) has been released in a very timely manner, so one can be fairly sure that there will be an announcement for the complete series of the Lucy/Desi hour (it consisted of only one season) shortly after this is released",1118534400,16,2288,4.733502538071066
2319824,5,B0009UC7OI,"I think that this season is one of my favorites. I don't know why, but I just love it. The whole Europe trip is a lot of fun. Especially the one where they're trapped in that cabin on top of the Swiss Alps, and the one in Scotland where Lucy dreams about the two headed monster being after anybody that's of MacGillicuddy heritage. I think they're all awesome, and I'm so happy.",1118534400,5,378,4.263888888888889
2319825,4,B0009UC7OI,"Season 1 and 5 are the only 4 star entries in this series, the rest are 5 stars. The first season was a bit forced (and hammy) as the actors were finding their way and while this season does contain 5 star episodes it really is slowed down and somewhat hampered by the European Trip (which is the bulk). Not sure if the reasoning seemed to the shows producers ""well the Hollywood trip went over well enough"" (which it did), but the material available for Europe was just not as ripe or as accessible, particularly the Swiss Alp episode and those of it's ilk. It could be that the writers seemed tapped for ideas in that small apartment because the last dozen episodes in S6 had them move to the country which I felt was a strong move that worked well for the show but ""another"" trip, especially this one was ill fated.

An obvious must for any Lucy fan or for that matter, any classic television buff, still in the world of ""Lucy"" Season 5 is a weak link in an otherwise golden chain.",1118275200,3,984,4.318918918918919
2319826,5,B0009UC7OI,"This is one of the best (definitely top three) seasons of I LOVE LUCY. The Ricardos and the Mertzes wrap up their trip to Hollywood and embark on a whirlwind trip to Europe.

With one week left in Tinseltown, Lucy can't resist taking home a souvenir to end all souvenirs - John Wayne's footprints! It's the hilarious two-part adventure, ""Lucy Visits Grauman's"" and ""Lucy and John Wayne."" On the train trip home, Lucy tangles with a jewel thief - and discovers the emergency stop cord really does actually stop the train - repeatedly - in ""The Great Train Robbery."" After a brief respite at home, Ricky, Lucy, Ethel and Fred head for an exciting tour of Europe - a transatlantic odyssey that starts with Lucy missing the boat (""Bon Voyage""), continues with a madcap romp across the British countryside (""The Fox Hunt""), gets a touch of star power in Paris (""Lucy Meets Charles Boyer""), and culminates in Lucy's classic, hilarious confrontation with a fellow female winemaker inside a vat of grapes (""Lucy's Italian Movie"").

It's the fantastic fifth season - all 26 HILARIOUS episodes from the 1955-56 season - of I Love Lucy, starring the world's favorite comedic redhead!

2320561,5,B0009UC7OI,"Seasons 4&5 of this classic television series I think are the pinnacle's of the series, don't get me wrong, every season is great, but when we go on the road with the Ricardo's and the Mertze's the fun really starts, from first going to L.A. in the great season 4, and still remaining in L.A. for the start of the great season 5 is absolute fun, and then Ricky gets called out to Europe, and the fun continues, and features many great episodes in the whole saga, such as 'The Passports' when Lucy gets in Fred's old trunk, and can't get out, and who can forget the episode 'Lucy's Italian Movie' which features the famous grape stomping scene, which is absolutely brilliant, great physical comedy from the one and only, or when Lucy misses the ship in 'Bon Voyage' and trying to bring back a piece of cheese on the airplane disguised as a baby.

As for the product, CBS/Paramount always releases great season sets, and this is no exception, from the great packaging, people who've already bought seasons 1-4 will know what I'm talking about with the outer box with 4 instead of 5 slim cases inside, and now lets get to the presentation, the picture and audio are absolutely stunning, the picture literally jumps right off the screen, and this isn't even in color, it's ultra sharp and clean, when you watch these episodes it's hard to believe you're watching something that is over 50 years old, it looks like it was filmed yesterday, and that's no kidding, there is no comparing the re-runs on television with the quality of these DVD's, and also I like to find that these episodes are indeed, UNCUT, so you see new parts of scenes that you never saw on the re-runs, trust me, I grew up with the re-runs (I'm 29 so I wasn't around when this series originally aired) and I wasn't aware there were so many parts of scenes that were cut for television broadcasting, it's an absolute delight for me to see the WHOLE episodes as they were originally broadcasted back when the series originally aired.

And you get tons of extras like you did with seasons 1-4 with flubs, billboards, and five more episodes of the radio series 'My Favorite Husband' as you did with seasons 1-4, so even if you taped all these episodes from the re-runs, it is totally worth getting these season sets, I had a bunch of tapes that I recorded these on, and probably had every episode, but not in their original chronological order, and certainly didn't have the pristine picture and sound as they season sets have, and now I only need season 6 and I'll have the complete series FINALLY, also, CBS/Paramount has been doing a fantastic job recently in releasing the first 3 seasons of Lucille Ball's second popular sitcom 'The Lucy Show' and season 4 is due out in late April this year, and also M.P.I. has been releasing the complete seasons of Lucille Ball's third popular sitcom 'Here's Lucy' and season 4 of said series is due out March 29th of this year, us Lucy fans REJOICE!",1296777600,4,2953,4.569811320754717

Though the episodes in Hollywood with Lucy and Ethel ""souvenir hunting"" John Wayne's footprints are great for laughing out loud, the favorite episode in our household is Lucy's struggle to get her passport. More than once the look on Ricky's face when he walks through the front door to the apartment and discovers a little man (the doctor from Lucy's childhood) dancing in his living room and hears a trunk (Lucy trapped inside) singin along has caused me to laugh until the tears stream down my face. Lucy just doesn't get any better.
And, by the way, did anyone ever really appreciate just what a great straight man Desi Arnaz could be?
Don't miss the almost-forgotten episode on the train trip home from Hollywood. It's a roll-in-the-floor laugher, too.",1208476800,2,836,4.853146853146853

2320647,5,B0009UC7OI,"Season five of I LOVE LUCY (1955-1956) from Paramount Home Video has some of the series' most classic episodes, including John Wayne's footprints in Hollywood and a memorable transcontinental train journey home to New York City on disk one; bon voyage to Europe and Lucy needing a helicopter to reach a missed ship on disk two; and all over Europe on disks three and four, including the grapes stomping (and fighting!) in Italy, romancing Charles Boyer and starting a nutty fashion trend in Paris, winning at gambling in Monte Carlo when they were not even consciously playing (and are not even supposed to be in the casino per Ricky), and, funniest of all, smuggling a huge smelly cheese through transatlantic customs disguised as a baby (then getting accused of murder in New York when Lucy and Ethel eat it en route to save on the price of a baby plane ticket!).  It is especially funny to see tight-wad Fred Mertz made Ricky's Band Manager and constantly take penny-pinching to new heights.  This matchless series is as great as TV sitcoms get.  And season five is close to the best season.  Other seasons have truly classic episodes, but season five has the most of them, especially impressive because it only has 26 episodes.

And we finally get I LOVE LUCY completely remastered, uncut, and non-commercial after half a century with cuts.  (The original shows clock in at around 26 minutes, so a full four minutes are missing from every syndicated episode, even now on TV Land.)  We also get a glimpse of what the show was really like in prime time, with bonus sections filled with animated commercials, original animated openings and intermission lead-ins, and animated fade-outs that have not been seen in fifty years.  The ""hearts on satin"" credits were not created until syndication.  And while Desi Arnaz still chain smokes, the series is now blessedly sponsored by Sanka, Lilt permanent, and Fluffo vegetable shortening, not a forgotten cigarette company.

The show, in season five, has a very special episode that aired on my fifth birthday--January 30, 1956.  It has also acquired two more writers.  Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf join Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr.  Their writing is world-class and the actors are immortal after more than half a century.  The latter three writers go back to 1949 and Lucille Ball's radio sitcom ""My Favorite Husband"", four episodes of which are included on the four disks.  We also see ""lost"" and flubbed scenes, and Jess Oppenheimer takes us behind the scenes on how he got the writing gig for the series.

This is an elegantly produced DVD from Paramount Home Video, with lots of fun bonuses and superb packaging.  I highly recommend renting or buying I LOVE LUCY season five.  I recommend buying because you will have an entire season in one trim package and will watch favorite shows often.",1175385600,6,2865,4.884297520661157

Disc 1:

Lucy Visits Grauman's - Ricky has finished the film and tells everyone that they are returning to NYC in on week.  The girls have to get everything done in one week.  First stop is Grauman's Chinese Theater. When they are there, they find that John Wayne's footprints are loose and she decides it would make the perfect souvenir.

Lucy and John Wayne - Lucy must replace the footprints or go to jail.  First Fred tries to forge but it doesn't fool anyone.  Then Ricky remembers he met Duke and calls him to help out.  But Lucy thinks it's another Freddie the forger original and erases it. They get Duke back and he again makes the print and signature (#2) but then Little Ricky is found playing in it.  Ricky has already gone to the studio and had Duke make another print (#3).  And Lucy comes up with the idea to have Duke step into wet cement then ask him to sign it.  She and Ethel put the wet cement outside Duke's dressing trailer but it's Ricky who steps into the cement ruining the boot print.  Lucy then realizes that she just needs to borrow the Duke's boots and redo the imprint.  This of course goes crazy when Duke surprises her in the trailer and she hides but does not escape as wanted - this is just crazy.  She winds up running out and leaving Ethel behind. John Wayne, like most stars were doing the show to promote a movie.

Lucy and the Dummy - Ricky returns from a studio going away party with a plastic head of himself used in the movie.  The studio calls and wants to have Ricky perform at an executive party at the studio. Lucy has convinced the studio that they have an act but Ricky is going fishing.  Lucy decides to use the plastic head and creates a fake Ricky for the performance.  As expected everything goes wrong but the studio execs thought it was a great comedy routine and offers Lucy a year's contract.

Ricky Sells the Car - Ricky has an offer to sell the car and he figures that with the family plan it would be cheaper to take the train but he has forgotten the Mertzes.

The Great Train Robbery - The train trip home starts and stops and starts and stops....  First, Lucy forgot her purse at the newsstand and sends Ricky to get it but the train is leaving and Lucy pulls the emergency brake to stop it (#1).  Then when Mother and Little Ricky are moved to another car, Lucy sees the new passenger has a gun and panics and pulls the emergency brake (#2).  He is really a jeweler carrying diamonds. Lucy finds out that there is a jewel thief on board and assumes that it is her new neighbor.  The real thief uses her to rob the jeweler and takes Lucy hostage but she pulls the emergency brake to foil him (#3).  The press get on board and are taking her picture when the conductor thinks that she going to pull the emergency brake and .... (#4).  Each time Fred and Ethel are in the Club Car and have their meal splattered on them.

Homecoming - The gang arrives back in NYC. Everyone treats Ricky as a star and ignores Lucy which infuriates her.  But after talking to a tabloid reporter, Lucy follows suit, which infuriates Ricky.

Face to Face -  Ricky is booked on a TV talk show.  But when Ricky's agent insults the apartment and tells Ricky he needs to move uptown, the Mertzes decided that he might be right and pick a fight to make the Ricardo's move.

Disc Two:

Lucy Goes to a Rodeo - Fred's lodge is having a show but when Ricky is booked to do a radio show, Fred must ask Lucy and Ethel to help out.  Fred and gang come up with a western themed show.  Ricky finds out that he is not booked to perform on a radio show but the rodeo.  When he cannot put together a show for the rodeo, he must beg Lucy, Fred and Ethel to pitch in.

Nursery School - Lucy doesn't want to send Little Ricky to a nursery school but Ricky insists that he goes.  After his first day, Little Ricky comes down with a cold and needs his tonsils removed.  But when he goes to the hospital Lucy won't leave him there alone overnight.

Ricky's European Booking -  Ricky gets a booking for a European tour.  But he cannot take Lucy with him.  Lucy and Ethel can go if they raise the money.  They decide to hold a raffle and create a fake name Ladies Oversees Assistance.  What the girls don't know is that it is illegal to hold a raffle for a fictitious organization.  All works out when Ricky finds out that if the band plays on the ship, the voyage is free.  So he can take the girls.  Ricky sings Forever Darling to promote his and Lucy's upcoming film.

The Passports - Lucy cannot find her birth certificate and needs two people to sign an affidavit they knew when Lucy was born.  In this episode we learn that Lucy was born in 1921 and this is the episode where Lucy gets locked in a steamer trunk.

Staten Island Ferry - Fred is seasick and the girls hate their passport pictures.  Fred and Lucy go on the Staten Island Ferry to test sea sick pills.  But they fall asleep on the Ferry and have to rush to make it to the passport office before it closes.

Bon Voyage - Well everything else has gone wrong with Lucy getting to Europe, why do you think that her getting on the boat would be easy?  Lucy gets left on the dock and has to find a way to get to the boat.  This episode includes another promotion for Forever Darling.

Second Honeymoon - Lucy wants this to be a second honeymoon but Ricky has to work.  She is depending on Ethel but when Fred gets the honeymoon bug, Lucy is left on her own.  She finally finds a way to get Ricky to herself but even that backfires.

Disc Three:

Lucy Meets the Queen - The gang arrives in London.  Lucy and Ethel want to see the queen and will do anything to get see her.  When they find out that she will be at the Palladium show, they are ecstatic.  They spend all day practicing their curtsey only to find out that only Ricky will meet the queen.  Ricky comes up with a loop hole.  If she is in the show, she might be able to meet the queen.  Ricky lets her perform in a dance routine but she has a Charlie horse from all the curtseying.  This is one her classic scenes.

The Fox Hunt -  Ricky has a meeting with a British movie producer and Lucy wangles an invitation to his country estate.  But things turn sour when she finds out that his daughter is the pretty star struck girl who has a crush on Ricky.  The show ends with a hilarious fox hunt. (Lucy repeats it 20 years later when she does the movie Mame.)

Lucy Goes to Scotland - Lucy wants to find her ancestors in Scotland but they don't have time.  So Lucy does the next best thing, she dreams about it in a musical sequence.  This is one of the best episodes of the season.

Paris at Last - The gang arrive on the continent.  And Lucy winds up in jail.  Lucy exchanges some dollars to francs on the street.  But they turn out to be counterfeit.  The police do not speak English and Lucy's French is not too good.  Ricky arrives but only speaks Spanish and English.  But there is a prisoner who speaks Spanish and French.  This leads to a translation telephone.

Lucy Meets Charlie Boyer - Lucy thinks every man is Charles Boyer.  When she learns that Ricky is to meet him it's Hollywood all over.  But when Boyer shows up at a caf that the gang is at, Ricky warns him and Boyer pretends to be a look alike.  This of course, keeps complicating itself.

Lucy Gets a Paris Gown - It is fashion week in Paris and Lucy wants one of the outlandish gowns that she and Ethel see at all the salons.  To teach her a lesson, Ricky and Fred have the hotel tailor make dresses out of burlap sacks, a horse feeder and a wine cooler.

Lucy Gets Homesick in Italy - It's Little Ricky's third birthday and Lucy misses him.  She winds up giving a birthday party for a group of local children.

Lucy's Italian Movie - This is one of the most famous episodes.  Lucy gets an offer to appear in an Italian movie and she decides to soak up some local color.  Since the movie is called Bitter Grapes, she assumes that the movie is about winemaking and she goes to a local winery and poses as one of the laborers.  This all ends up in a wine vat.

Lucy's Bicycle Trip - It's only 35 miles to Nice, so Lucy thinks it would be picturesque to take bicycles from Italy.  The problem is that when they arrive at the Italian - French border, Lucy cannot find her passport.  This episode also includes a great scene where the gang spend the night in a barn and Lucy actually milks a cow.

Lucy Goes to Monte Carlo -  Lucy wants to see the famous casino but Ricky forbids her.  To get around his ban, Lucy and Ethel go to dinner at the famous restaurant in the casino.  Lucy finds a chip on the floor and tosses it on the roulette table and wins and wins and wins.  She winds up with 875,000 francs!  Now, how does she explain it to Ricky?

Return Home from Europe - Well, Lucy has wreak havoc across Europe but that is not enough for her.  She wants to bring a 25 lb piece of cheese home for mother but Ricky is not willing to pay the overage for it.  So only Lucy would try to pass it off as a baby but what Lucy doesn't know is that baby's don't fly free.  So how do you get rid of the cheese?

This is another great season.  The interesting thing is that each disc is a story in itself.  Disc 1 is the end of Hollywood and the return home.  Disc 2 is the beginning of the trip to Europe.  Disc 3 is London and France.  Disc 4 is the rest of Europe and the return home.

These are the fully restored episodes including the original blackout commercials.  In the early days, TV shows were sponsored by products.  In the early years it was Philip Morris and you constantly saw their cigarette packages placed throughout each episode.  From the 4th season on, there were multiple sponsors.  They usually promoted their product as part of the mid episode break.  These have been restored.

2320656,1,B0009UC7OI,"This (incomplete) set is an example of how these GREEDY companies are running AMOK with their stratospheric pricing.  Not only for the 'I Love Lucy' set, but most other 'boxed sets' that cost a small fortune ('The Sopranos' is another one).  Yeah, I can hear some of you tell me that it costs money for these companies to produce the show, or remaster and 'clean up' the original tapes/films, etc., BUT the huge price they charge insures that not too many people will be able to purchase these sets in the first place.  Then they wonder why so many people attempt to 'burn' their own copies!  With boxed sets like this essentially targeted for the 'well to do', how can hardworking, average Joe's afford this?",1142035200,4,709,4.648

I think the main reason is that Paramount released these seasons in a fast pace that their quality control got a little sloppy. Hopefully, Season 6 won't have any issues since Paramount is taking their time and not releasing it until the Spring. Hope that helps you.",1132617600,8,636,4.491379310344827
2320704,4,B0009UC7OI,"I love Lucy- and have most of her movies and most of the series. This season however is not my favorite... although featuring some classic episodes such as when Lucy and Ethel wear burlap sacks by accident thinking their designer dresses or that infamous wine stomping scene. But, mainly Lucy and Ricky have lost that ""spark"" you saw in seasons 1-4 having notrious difficulties at the time you call that on screen as well.

The gang having just returned from Hollywood in the last season- get ready for a trip around Europe together as Ricky tours Europe. Having numerous incidents and run-ins with locals from imprissonments to not being allowed to cross the border. The gang faces it all together with enormous humour.

Some great episodes with a few celebrities show off Lucy's comedic talent. Still it's not one of her best seasons on the air.

Be sure to buy this one Lucy fans- and newbie- Lucy fans try season 2,3,or 4- you'll fall in love with Lucy!!!

2320705,1,B0009UC7OI,"I have been purchasing all the new ""I Love Lucy"" seasons on DVD since CBS started releasing them (I never bought the overpriced first release of season one). It seemed like they were releasing a season every two months or so during early 2005 but for some reason they have been reluctant to bring us season six. Releasing seasons 1-5 as a set makes no sense to me (although I can see leaving out the episodes from the ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" as that was a different show really). I have to wonder if something is holding up the release of the sixth and final season of the half-hour ""I Love Lucy"" series. Could it be the Superman episode? Maybe they can't get clearance from Warners to include this episode on the DVD.

If nothing is blocking season six from release then why didn't CBS just wait until that season was available so they could do a ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Series"" box set in some uniquely designed outer box? If they wanted to be really greedy they could have made season six only available as part of the complete series box set (but let's not give them bad ideas).

Lucy will always get 5 stars from me but this incomplete set, conspicuously missing the final season, is a one star wonder.",1131667200,15,1210,4.445945945945946
2320706,1,B0009UC7OI,"Why is season #6 missing from the set, as well as the Lucy/Desi Comedy Hours?  Are they available for purchase separately?  Many thanks,  Kenn Barton-Jones",1131408000,4,155,5.12
2320707,1,B0009UC7OI,"Why would CBS release a box set containing seasons 1 through 5, when there is still another season remaining, season 6.  Why didn't they release season 6 for those of us who have seasons 1-5 already, and then release the complete I Love Lucy box set with seasons 1-6.  Season 6 has all those good episodes like ""Lucy and Bob Hope,"" ""Lucy Meets Orson Welles,"" ""Deep Sea Fishing,"" ""Lucy and the Loving Cup,"" ""Lucy and Superman,"" ""Little Ricky Gets a Dog,"" ""Lucy Raises Chickens,"" ""Building a Bar-B-Q,"" ""Lucy Raises Tulips,"" and ""The Ricardos Dedicate a Statue,"" among some other good ones.  It must have to do with money again, just as it did when CBS charged over $100 for season 1 alone when it first came out.

Now, they're going to make people think that this is the ""complete"" I Love Lucy series, when it isn't; there's still season 6.  I wouldn't buy this at this time, I'd wait until they offer the COMPLETE I Love Lucy, seasons 1-6.  To buy season 1-5 is to buy an incomplete package.  C'mon CBS, take back the seasons 1-5 box set and re-release is with season 6 to make it COMPLETE, that would be the logical thing to do.  Who knows what's going on over at CBS, obviously some kind of disorganized marketing department or strategy.",1130544000,17,1238,4.520179372197309

2320753,5,B0009UC7OI,"I am 51 years old and can remember sitting and watching I Love Lucy on TV with my Mom.  Even then they were reruns because the show had already been on for several seasons before I was born.  Still there never has been a show as funny as I Love Lucy.  I have seen every episode more than 100 times and I still laugh Hysterically when watching them again on DVD as if I was watching it the first time.

What's nice about the DVD series is now you can pick when you want to watch a particular episode.  We were discussing Lucy the other day and were referring to the episode where Lucy meets Charles Boyer.  It was great to come home and plug in that episode and relive Lucy and Ethel's capers referring back to our earlier converstion.

Foe me as an ultimate Lucy fan this season was just a natural progression. I have every season and as soon as the next one is available I am ordering it.  It has also been amazing to get each new season and think about how long the show was on and all of he different stories that have been written.  It is also entertaining to watch all of the performers because all of them, Desi, Vivian, and William were incredilbe actors and sometimes the other three are overlooked.

This a must buy for every Lucy fan as are all of the seasons.  You'll never get tired of Lucy.",1127174400,8,1303,4.213709677419355

2320757,5,B0009UC7OI,"Yes, it's that famous episode where Lucy runs around like a maniac on a giant bed of grapes, playfully tormenting a puzzled Italian woman.  That's just one of the 26 episodes on this set, which features the Ricardos and Mertzes' tour of Europe.  As with the other sets, the episodes are crisply remastered, and the special features, which include lost scenes, flubs and ""Lucy on the Radio,"" are second to none.  It's how Lucy should be seen - in mint condition, better than she has looked in 50 years.",1127088000,,501,4.606741573033708
2320758,5,B0009UC7OI,"Season 5 of this classic sit com begins just a few months after season 4 ended.  The gang is still in Los Angeles where Ricky has just finished filming his picture.  Fortunately, there's still time for a few hijinks, including trying to steal John Wayne's footprints in the two hilarious episodes that start the season.  Even traveling back is an adventure when Lucy decides there's a robber on the train.

Things are just beginning to settle down in New York when Ricky and his band get a series of bookings in Europe.  Soon, the foursome are off again where Lucy meets the Queen in England, gets arrested for counterfeiting in Paris, and gets trapped in an avalanche in the Swiss Alps.

The most famous episode from this season comes near the end.  ""Lucy's Italian Movie"" is better known as the grape stomping episode and has one of the classic physical comedy routines from the show in it.

Actually, the last several episodes are sharp as ""Lucy's Bicycle Trip,"" ""Lucy Goes to Monte Carlo,"" and ""Return Home from Europe"" are also absolutely hilarious episodes.

Even after five years, this show hasn't lost any of its laughs.  In fact, the situations just seem to get more outrageous and yet they work.  If we'd started with some of these stunts, it would seem implausible, but by now when Lucy wins a fortunate at roulette accidentally, we buy it.  As with any season of any show, this one has its week moments.  I find the England episodes rather dull.  But over all, this set is more then worth it.

And this set continues to meet the high standards set by the previous releases.  Since there are only 26 episodes this go around, there are only four discs.  Still, the picture is sharp.  The sound seemed a little weaker then normal is spots, but it's only a minute or so once or twice at disc.  On the whole, it's fine.  The discs are still loaded with the behind the scenes info we've grown to expect.

A brief note about ""Lucy and the Dummy.""  The back of the box mentions it is edited from its original version.  As the disc itself explains, the episode ran short originally, so they included a preview of a new movie coming soon from MGM.  Since they couldn't get the rights to that promo, they couldn't include it here.  Still, they have restored the run up to it, and it has nothing to do with the storyline or any of the jokes.  We aren't really missing any I LOVE LUCY here.

This set has so many classic moments it's hard to list them all.  Pack your bags and get ready to travel and laugh with Lucy.",1126828800,31,2516,4.47032967032967

2320783,5,B0009UC7OI,"Meet Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.  They live in an apartment in New York where Ricky works as a nightclub bandleader.  Their closest friends are Fred and Ethel Mertz, who also happen to be their landlords.  Lucy wants a career in show business as well, and is always trying to get into Ricky's act.  Even when she isn't trying to do that, she's involved in one wacky scheme or another.  And the two couples have some great battles of the sexes.

This set is five of the six seasons from the classic show.  Season one starts a little slow with Lucy often carrying the show alone.  As the writers get more comfortable with the other characters, their parts expand and the show finds it's footing.  Even with a slow start, this show has some classic moments.  Lucy tries to learn ""The Ballet"" and a burlesque act to get into Ricky's show.  The couple makes a bet over who can go longer without gossiping.  Lucy gets trapped in a freezer.  Ricky puts Lucy on a time schedule.  And of course, ""Lucy does a TV Commercial"" for Vitameatavegamin with hilarious results.  Also included in this set is the original unaired pilot.

Season two starts out with a bang as Lucy works in a chocolate factory in ""Job Switching.""  Ethel and Lucy both via for the presidency of their club.  Lucy has trouble deciding on anything.  The couples fight over a washing machine.  Of course, the most famous storyline of season 2 was Lucy's pregnancy and the birth of Little Ricky.  Brought on by Lucy's real life pregnancy, this was very daring for the time.  How things have changed in the last 50 years.

Season three brings with it it's own classic moments.  Lucy and Ethel buy the same dress for a TV show.  The couples fight over ""Equal Rights.""  ""Lucy Tells the Truth"" with unintended consequences.  The girls attend a ""Charm School.""  ""Ricky Loses His Temper"" in an episode that should nominate him for sainthood.  When Ricky's band gets booked to Hawaii, Lucy and the Mertzes scheme to go, too.  The couples find a ""Bonus Buck"" their local paper is running.  And the girls want to learn to play golf so they can hang out with the boys.

Early in season four, a storyline is introduced that changes the course of the season.  Ricky gets a movie offer in Hollywood, so the gang travels cross-country, stopping in Ohio, Tennessee, and New Mexico before finally making it.  Once there, Lucy starts stalking the stars with hilarious results.  She once more tries to get into the act, this time a movie.  And she does a classic routine with Harpo Marx.

Season five finishes up the California episodes with a funny visit from John Wayne and a classic trip home.  They're hardly home before Ricky and his band are booked to Europe, and Lucy and the Mertzes tag along.  Once there, they get involved in a ""Fox Hunt,"" get accused of counterfeiting in Paris, get caught in an avalanche, and have trouble with a boarder crossing.  Most famously from this trip, Lucy gets a little more local color then she bargained for when she decides to research wine making for what she is sure will be her big break.

Anyone who loves this show will love these DVDs.  The picture is black and white and the sound is mono, but anything else would ruin this classic.  And the picture has been cleaned up.  I've never seen it look this sharp with only the occasional dust and grain.  Each disc is loaded with extras including information on the guest cast, mistakes that made it on air, behind the scenes facts, deleted scenes, original openings, and episodes from Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband.""

This show has been entertaining people for 50 years, and it shows no signs of letting up.  I am thrilled to have this show in such wonderful shape.  No matter how many times I see them, I still laugh through every episode.  Don't miss a chance to own a true TV classic.",1124150400,44,3827,4.573746312684365
2320784,5,B0009UC7OI,"We last left the Ricardo's and the Mertzs in Hollywood.  Lucy and Ethel are still trying to meet the maximum amount of movie stars during there brief time in Hollywood.  This season starts with Lucy trying to get the greatest star memorabilia of all, the footprints of John Wayne.  A classic episode spread over two parts.

Season Five takes the Ricardo's and Mertzs through Hollywood, back to NYC, then over seas to Europe.  It has classic Lucy moments such as her trip in Italy stomping grapes.  Also includes probably one of my favorite episodes, The Great Train Robbery.  In this episode Lucy goes a little overkill on the emergency breaks.  This season guarantees laughs during each episode.

I am very pleased with the timely release of each season.  This is a collectors dream.  Each episode is in high quality and is packaged in a neat and convenient box set.  CBS has recovered greatly from the previously shaking release of only four episodes per disc.  Definitely buy this season as well as others in order to preserve Lucy for further generations.",1122508800,11,1059,4.816666666666666

2320786,5,B0009UC7OI,"There will never ever be another Lucille Ball.  All imitators should just check their chuckles at the door.  No sitcom from the last 30 years can hold a torch to the loveable redhead and her three comrades in comedy.  The mean spirited raunch of reality tv could learn something about real entertainment after only one or two viewings of this classic comedy.  The timing, the sight gags, the stunts, the one liners..priceless.  All of it.  This is the only DVD tv series I am religious about buying every time a new season is released.  All others are just filler.  Lucy is the Queen of Comedy.  Now and Forever.  Somewhere in Heaven God is laughing out loud.",1121299200,13,659,4.603448275862069

2320788,5,B0009UC7OI,"Over 50 years ago during the early years of broadcast television, the very inspired talents of Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and her then husband Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) were showcased on their hilarious television show ""I Love Lucy"". TV execs had initially rejected the plausibility of the show because of Desi and because they intended to tape the shows. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of Lucille Ball and Desi's obvious talents, the show first aired in 1951 and quickly became one of the most successful TV shows during all six of its regular seasons. As Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on ""I Love Lucy"", Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were joined by William Frawley (1877-1966) and Viviane Vance (1909-1979) as their best-friends/apartment landlords of Fred and Ethel Mertz.

The fifth season of ""I Love Lucy"" that aired between 1955 and 1956 has 26 memorable episodes:

1. ""Lucy Visits Grauman's"": With Ethel's help, Lucy steals John Wayne's footprints from Grauman's Chinese Theater.

2. ""Lucy and John Wayne"": Lucy and Ethel try to return the footprints that they stole, but they break; so Ricky enlists the help from John Wayne (himself) to make a new set.  More than one may be needed.

3. ""Lucy and the Dummy"": After Ricky backs out of a party where Lucy wants her big break, Lucy makes a dummy of Ricky to dance with at the party.

4. ""Ricky Sells the Car"": After Ricky sells the car, Fred & Ethel think they'll have to ride a motorcycle back to NYC; but Ricky buys train tickets for all.

5. ""The Great Train Robbery"": Thinking there's a jewel thief on board the train to NYC, Lucy can't stop pulling the emergency brake cord. (Train conductor played by Frank Nelson, 1911-1986.)

6. ""Homecoming"": Upon returning to NYC, Ricky is a big star, but Lucy initially doesn't share in everyone's worship of him.

7. ""The Ricardos Are Interviewed"": Ricky & Lucy consider moving and Ricky is to be interviewed on a prestigious show.

8. ""Lucy Goes to a Rodeo"": After Ricky can't help Fred with a rodeo-themed show for his lodge, Lucy & Ethel volunteer to help.

9. ""Nursery School"": After Lucy's fear of Little Ricky getting sick at nursery school comes to pass, she is determined to stay with him at the hospital.

10. ""Ricky's European Booking"": When Ricky can't afford to take Lucy on his European tour, she & Ethel dream up a raffle to help the ""Ladies Overseas Aid"", which they think is themselves.

11. ""The Passports"": Lucy can't find her birth certificate so that she can get her passport.

12. ""Staten Island Ferry"": To help Fred overcome seasickness, Lucy takes him onto the Staten Island Ferry; but she gets seasick herself and may be late to the passport office. (Passport clerk played by Charles Lane.)

13. ""Bon Voyage"": When the ship leaves port for Europe, Lucy is inadvertently left behind; so she'll have to get to ship via a helicopter. One of the best fifth-season episodes!

14. ""Second Honeymoon"": Lucy wants the Atlantic cruise to be a second honeymoon, but Ricky is too busy with the band.

15. ""Lucy Meets the Queen"": After Lucy misses seeing the queen at Buckingham Palace, Ricky gets invited to met the queen, but not Lucy.  Of course, when has ""no"" ever stopped Lucy?

16. ""The Fox Hunt"": Bragging that she can ride, Lucy gets to show how well she can actually ride a horse in a fox hunt.

17. ""Lucy Goes to Scotland"": Lucy wants to travel to Scotland to meet her distant McGillicuddy relatives. The dream sequence that unfolds is unforgettable.

18. ""Paris at Last"": Not having any French currency, Lucy, Ethel & Fred exchange money with a so-called French artist (Shepard Menken, 1921-1999), who turns out to be a counterfeiter. The translation sequence is priceless, as is Lucy's introduction to escargot!

19. ""Lucy Meets Charles Boyer"": Lucy & Ethel are star-struck when they encounter Charles Boyer (himself) at a sidewalk cafe.

20. ""Lucy Gets a Paris Gown"": When Lucy goes on hunger strike to force Ricky to buy her an expensive French-designed dress, Ricky & Fred have dresses custom-made out of burlap.  (A fantastic episode!)

21. ""Lucy in the Swiss Alps"": Lucy, Ricky, Fred & Ethel get trapped in an avalanche while mountain climbing until they here ""La Cucaracha"" being played.

22. ""Lucy Gets Homesick in Italy"": In this heart-warming episode, Lucy misses Little Ricky during his birthday, so a little Italian shoeshine boy (Bart Bradley) and his friends get to celebrate with her.

23. ""Lucy's Italian Movie"": In one of the best episodes of all time, Lucy takes ""getting some local color"" a little literally when she travels to an old-fashioned Italian winery to press grapes to impress an Italian film director. (Italian wine stomper played by Theresa Tirelli, 1907-1989).

24. ""Lucy's Bicycle Trip"": Lucy has trouble crossing back into France when she can't find her passport.

25. ""Lucy Goes to Monte Carlo"": When Lucy picks up a chip in a Monte Carlo casino, she inadvertently wins thousands of French franks.

26. ""Return Home From Europe"": To sneak home a 30-pound cheese, Lucy dresses it up as baby to fly home to NYC; but the passenger (Mary Jane Croft, 1916-1999) next to her flips out when the cheese disappears.

Paramount Home Video's superb job of packaging all 30 episodes of the fourth season of ""I Love Lucy"" onto 5 DVD's is a good indication as to how they will similarly package the fifth season onto 4.  Overall, for superb packaging and a great price, I rate the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Fifth Season"" DVD box set with an anticipatory 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it!",1119139200,256,5535,4.799789251844047
