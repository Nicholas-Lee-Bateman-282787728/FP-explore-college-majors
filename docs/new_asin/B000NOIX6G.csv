Everyone of these made for TV movies are already included in t he complete set as individual two-part episodes. If you order both and discover this fact and return them, only a small refund will be authorized. They should have warned me that these movies were already part of the complete series bundle, as 2 part episodes. It is a simple matter for their web team to write a script that would warn all those who order this set with the complete series that all these movies were 2-part episodes of the series and are duplicates of episodes already included in the series bundle. As they say, ""Buyer Beware"".",1471824000,10,678,4.565573770491803

Each episode plays straight through with no interruption or ending credits until the end of the entire episode.  Also the episodes are: Vanishing Act (Season 1), The Last Laugh (Season 2), Murder on the Run (Season 3) and Fatal Impact (Season 5).  These episodes show the characters at their best and working as a team to solve the murders that happen in each one.

2773608,5,B000NOIX6G,"After watching all of the Monk series, wanted to find something similar.  What I like about Diagnosis Murder is that you never know how the bad guy is.  It is never the one you suspect it to be.  Great detective movie.",1418860800,,218,4.2682926829268295

Unfortunately, we didn't try to play these DVDs until after the return policy expired, so I guess we just threw $26 down the drain.

2773616,5,B000NOIX6G,Very good DVD season series. When played on a tv set looks like original broadcasted version. But some dvd may not work in portable or dvd burners. All works fine on a table top DVD player. Good buy.,1408406400,,199,4.2631578947368425

2773639,5,B000NOIX6G,"Dick van Dyke has always been a favorite of mine and the blend of characters and personalities in Diagnosis Murder keep you interested until the very end.  I have several other Seasons of the show in my collection.  Much better to watch these ""reruns"" than some of the current shows being televised!",1402444800,3,299,4.730769230769231
2773640,5,B000NOIX6G,"I always enjoyed this series and Season 2 is no exception.  Great little thrillers with wondeful acting by Dick Van Dyke and the supporting cast.  Very light, as also with Murder She Wrote, and I enjoy this kind of drama. Would recommend highly!",1398556800,,245,4.674418604651163
2773641,5,B000NOIX6G,Hate newer shows on television. Especially reality shows. Miss older nicer shows on television now. Great to find Diagnosis Murder on DVD. No channels show it on cable except one channel sometimes in Sundays.,1393372800,,208,5.147058823529412
2773642,5,B000NOIX6G,This show has a bunch of good actors. They work together and they solve fun mysteries. They show respect for all peoples.,1392681600,,121,4.545454545454546
2773643,4,B000NOIX6G,"I would give this three stars for the quality of the discs (as one episode simply will NOT play due to skipping, and another skips a good 15 minutes of the show), but five for the show itself. Because I could have received bum discs or something, I have decided to go ahead and give it 4 stars.

DM is one of the best mystery shows ever made. It is fun, has a great cast and keeps you wanting to watch more. I like the variation in the episodes in that sometimes we know who did it up front and other times we follow Dr. Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) to the resolution. This season has the cast acting more comfortably with each other and their roles and the murders have a little more mystery to them. Unfortunately, this was some of my favorite cast members' last run with the show, but they still killed their performances. Season 2 is by far my favorite season of DM. As an added note, the entire series is now out in a box set on DVD! Praise the Lord!",1388880000,,948,4.124324324324324

2773646,5,B000NOIX6G,"When my husband and I finished watching the last Matlock, we ordered this one. We had not seen it when it was originally on, and were not sure we would like it. but, just a few episodes convinced us to buy the whole series. It is set in a hospital, but it isn't the usual doctor show. It is a mystery series with stories that are really different, and some of them are very funny. If you like Matlock, you will probably like this one too.",1384387200,,438,4.104651162790698
2773697,5,B000NOIX6G,The 2nd season is just a good as the first if not better.  Enjoy all the hospital personnel that adds to the depth of the show and the comic quality of the show which takes nothing away from the murder plot line and the detective work that leads to solving it by the lead character - Dr. Sloan of course.  Looking to buy 3rd season soon.,1383523200,,337,4.090909090909091

His charm and wit coupled with the medical setting is great because the show brings to light some details of the medical profession that few get to see! I am a nurse so I have really enjoyed the series' take on an old, and all too often, stuffy profession!

2773788,5,B000NOIX6G,"There are a lot of murder mystery series, made in the 1980's and 1990's, that essentially follow the same format: each week an ""older"", amateur detective solves a relatively bloodless murder, usually with the help of one or two younger assistants. I'm not criticizing these series, I have been a fan of shows such as ""Murder She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"" since they were first screened. Nevertheless, rewatching many of these shows on DVD, I now realize just how predictable and formulaic many of them are (not that that's a bad thing - there is something comforting about the predictability of these shows). Season two of ""Diagnosis Murder"" also follows this same formula, but it does so in such a way as to stand out from the other shows in this genre.

This season of ""Diagnosis Murder"" is funny, innovative and some of the murders are actually a challenge to solve (often I can solve a ""Murder She Wrote"" mystery before the crime has even been committed). Episodes in this season include ""A Very Fatal Funeral"" (in which all of the murder suspects keep dropping dead just as Mark Sloan and his friends become convinced that they're guilty), ""The Busy Body"" (in which a corpse keeps vanishing and reappearing), ""The Bela Lugosi Blues"" (featuring a murderess who may or may not be a vampire), ""Death in the Daytime"" (in which Amanda makes a guest appearance on ""The Young and the Restless"") and ""My Baby is Out of the World"" (in which one of Mark's patients insists that the father of her baby is an alien from another planet), among others. The highlights of this season, however, are ""Many Happy Returns"" and ""Sea No Evil"", which feature Holland Taylor as a very determined IRS agent. Taylor, who later went on to appear as Evelyn Harper in ""Two and a Half Men"", is, as always, a joy to watch and is the perfect foil for Mark Sloan. There is a good reason why the makers of this show asked her back for a second appearance.

If you are a fan of shows such as ""Murder She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"", then this DVD set is a must. Murder mystery series don't get much better than this.",1236816000,3,2075,4.575268817204301
2773789,5,B000NOIX6G,"This is one of those rare shows that is both suspenseful and enjoyable while remaining clean cut. It is a rare gem. It is much like the old classic Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Mysteries...intriguing, mysterious, fun...and without the fear of blood, guts, and foul language. I watch this show with my children, with my friends, and by myself. It is a great way to lose the worries of the day as you try to help the charming Mr. Van Dyke unravel all of the clues. I would highly recommend this show to anyone.",1197676800,5,505,4.382978723404255
2773790,5,B000NOIX6G,"Why is not the DVD subtitled in other languages, like in Spanish, por example?.

2773792,5,B000NOIX6G,"I was a big fan of the show when it was on network TV and now I can relive the excitment over and over again when ever I want. I have ""season one"" and it was a natural to add ""season two"".",1184457600,5,188,3.5
2773793,5,B000NOIX6G,"It was fun to see the episodes in their entirety and see the missing scenes that aren't shown on reruns. Some stories even make more sense. I hope they continue releasing seasons three thru eight and the movies as well, I'll buy them all!!!",1183852800,8,240,4.4772727272727275
2773794,5,B000NOIX6G,"This is one of the best doctor-murder shows of all time. In this season watch Dr. Sloane, go through car troubles and getting his rental car blown up, watch Amanda lose all of her money and Jack trying to get it back for her (and actually does!!!!), Dr. Sloane get accused of murder, and also get locked in a Emergency Room with happy gas, and arrest a girl for muurder, going to court TWICE, without double jepordy. This show is a down heart, good show. Although it is mainly about murders and the sick, Dick Van Dykes character will make you laugh. The show stars Dick Van Dyke (Dr. Mark Sloane), Barry Van Dyke (Lt. Steve Sloane), Scott Baio (Dr. Jack Stewart) and Victoria Rowell (Amanda Bentley) Hope this review was helpfull!!!!",1182902400,25,734,4.568181818181818

8179923,3,B000NOIX6G,"This is season two of Diagnosis Murder.  This is the season that almost got the series canceled.  After some cast changes, they brought it back as a midseason replacement for the third season.  But it is easy to see why they almost canceled the series.  The plots were recycled.  Dr. Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) was accused of murderagain.  The irritating Norman Briggs (Michael Tucci) was accused of murder.  They started ripping off the plots from films.  They found more ways to allow Dick Van Dyke to sing and dance.  Since they once locked Victoria Rowell in a locker they had to do the same to Scott Baio.  What are the odds?  And in spite of the title, they had episodes that didn't involve murder.  They abruptly cut the comedy and tried to turn serious in an episode involving domestic violence.  The tone and tenor of the series was still inconsistent, hit or miss at best.  And if it felt as if some of the episodes were pilots for proposed series that were never made, thats because they were pilots!",1509321600,,1006,4.5474860335195535
