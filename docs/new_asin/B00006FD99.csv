1749734,5,B00006FD99,"This series is one of my ultimate favorites. It has all the makings of a great anime series supurb animation, great storyline, and wonderfuly written charaters. The basics of this series have to do with a pair of space outlaws just trying to make a buck, find a incerdible space ship with it's human-androd navigator, and assemble a rag-tag crew and their adventures which end up with them seaching for the ""Glatic layline"".

I saw this show on TV in the late 90's. It rocked my face off. The premise was pretty different, the characters kicked ass, and the animation was good. Everything about Outlaw Star is incredible.

Seeing the series again, (uncut) is awesome. You never would imagine how much it was edited for tv until you see this version.

This boxed set itself couldn't be simpler, three dvd cases and two discs in each case. Nice compact box too.

If your a fan of good space action and characters that grow on you, you should check this out.",1180396800,,486,4.388888888888889
1749801,4,B00006FD99,"There's plenty of sci-fi anime series out there, but ""Outlaw Star"" is something a bit special, just like the ship in the title. Instead of comedy or pure futuristic adventure, this series strikes a balance of futuristic grittiness and some outright comedy, with some deliciously unexpected twists and a satisfying finale.

For money, Outlaw Gene Starwind and his preteen pal Jim will do almost anything -- bounty-hunting, bodyguarding, and other odd jobs. But when they agree to guard a strange woman (whose name turns out to be ""Hot Ice"" Hilda) and her mystery briefcase, they didn't expect to be hunted by pirates -- or that the briefcase contains a cyborg girl, Melfina.

For their own safety, Hilda sweeps Jim and Gene off to the system where she's hiding another ship -- the advanced Outlaw Star, which requires Melfina to fly. And when Hilda is killed, Gene suddenly finds himself the owner of a mysterious, ultra-advanced, ultra-powerful grappler ship. Except everyone else wants it too, and to keep it, Jim will have to deal with more than just pirates and Tao masters.

As the story proceeds, Gene will have to deal with a beautiful, lethal assassin who reluctantly joins up, killer robots the beastlike Ctarl-Ctarl, the terrifying Anten Seven, a prison planet, giant carnivore shrimps, and a familiar ship that might carry his father's murderers. They travel from planet to planet and even get into a space race, before setting off to find the Galactic Leyline.

Imagine ""Outlaw Star"" as a sort of ""Cowboy Bebop,"" but not nearly as sad, and with more emphasis on comedy, money, and fast-paced space battles. Ithas a sort of spaghetti western atmosphere, since our heroes live on a rough-hewn frontier where it's every man for himself, and you're constantly threatened by pirates.

In some ways, this is unusually realistic sci-fi, where the heroes have bills to pay, and don't automatically know how to pilot a ship. The first few episodes are pretty straightforward space opera, but it loosens up once the initial storyline is over -- then we get some one-off storylines, an underlying arc full of mysteries about the Leyline.

The animation is detailed, solid and refined, with lots of intricate scenes involving boxing spacecraft and bustling cities, as well as sword fights, killer robots, and gun battles with magic bullets. The only problem is some of the action scenes with Suzuka, where she looks kind of half-drawn. But the scripts are tightly written, with some nicely snappy dialogue (""So you're... DEAF Rob?"" ""That's 'DEATH'!"").

Gene makes a nice battle-scarred hero, who likes women, wine and having his own ship, although he hates space travel. And the naive, confused Melfina, deadly Suzuka, and smart preteen Jim make a nice backing cast. The supporting cast is mostly colourful and well-rounded, from space frogs to grizzled old outlaws to Fred Luo, a gay weapons heir who is just a bit too fond of Gene. Aisha Clanclan is too bombastic and crazy for the rest of the cast, though.

The series ""Outlaw Star"" is a solid, entertaining sci-fi anime, with plenty of action, comedy and a well-rounded futuristic setting. Definitely worth checking out.",1179792000,,3173,5.019011406844107
1749802,5,B00006FD99,"Honestly, for me this had a lot of things i like.  Outlaw Star is a Sci Fi anime series with space fights on grappler ships, gun fights everywhere else, and a crazy crew that kicks butt their own way.  I can't describe too much but i had fun with this series ever since it came on the Cartoon Network.  It might be described as Cowboy Bebob in its time, but without the awesome soundtrack.",1179446400,,389,4.22972972972973
1749803,2,B00006FD99,"I originally watched Outlaw Star when it was on Cartoon Network, and thought it was one of the best anime's I had ever seen.

How disapointed I was when I ordered and actually started to watch it.

Outlaw Star is another tragic example of people trying to mix a very simple and almost childish atmosphere with mature themes and language.  Which in short means that the storyline and the dialog my attract the attention of younger people who shouldn't be exposed to the language and the nudity that is in the cartoon, while more mature audiences may feel almost embaressed to be watching something so simple.

Baisically, it's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon with foul language and sex.  It's a very poor mix.

Except for their dialog, the characters are great.  the storyline, although sometimes predictable and simple eventually picks up, and by the end, you truly want to know what the Galactic Layline is, if you can get that far in the series.",1179014400,3,956,4.757575757575758
1749824,5,B00006FD99,"Next to Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star is the best anime show around. Outlaw Star tells the story of 2 friends/business partners Gene Starwind and Jim Hawking

who want to live the outlaw's life of danger. They get this and more when an outlaw shows up one day at their door. The next thing they know they are being chased by pirates who want a ship called the XGP. They soon find out that their traveling companion stole the ship and the pirates are after her.

Hilda sacrifices herself so that Gene, Jim, and the bioandroid named Melfina  can escape the pirates and keep the XGP out of reach of the pirates. In addition to Melfina, Gene and Jim pick up two others that make up the crew of the newly named Outlaw Star. Our wandering crew of outlaws go around the galaxy in search of money and the secret of the galactic leyline; all the while trying to evade the pirates who want their ship.

 Action, adventure, and danger make Outlaw Star a great buy for anime lovers.",1178928000,,966,4.404494382022472

It details the exploits of Gene Starwind and his motley crew while being chased by space pirates, trying to make a living, and trying to find the Galactic Leyline.  Plenty of action and the chemistry between Gene and Jim is great.  My only complaint was Aisha Clan-Clan.  She was annoying.",1177977600,,453,4.6835443037974684

Looking for something known as the lay line..... That is about it. With very little character development other then a couple main people, I personally found myself drifting away from the story and focusing on the action. There were a few select moments where I did find myself drawn to the story but they were so few and so fast that it never lasted for more then a couple seconds.

1749831,5,B00006FD99,"This anime has got to be the best anime I have ever seen. It takes place far in the future where space exploration is no longer a dream. It has a great story and a increadable cast of characters that add to the overall greatness of this anime. Gene Starwind the main character goes through many changes throughout the whole serious overcoming incredible obstacles and facing his fears. It is also quite funny at certain parts and also has its fair share of romance.

1749832,5,B00006FD99,I've been looking for a boxed set of Outlaw Star for several years.  I don't know if I was looking in the wrong spots or what but I finally found this one.  I've been fans of Anime forever.,1152835200,,189,3.9473684210526314
1749833,5,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star...Words can hardly describe this series in a nutshell. This seies makes all your parent's sci-fi series (like Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.) look like kids shows. I think that the reason this series was an anime and not a real movie is due to the fact that there's action scenes and things in this series that actors on a screen can't portray. But then again that's just my opinion.

Gene Starwind is a rough and tumble bounty hunter on Sentinel III, the planet the first episode takes place on. His partner is eleven year old Jim Hawking a boy genius and hacker. Gene and Jim  take on any job that'll make them some money, ""We fix everything from machines to relationships!"" is their motto. When Pirates suddenly decend on Sentinel looking for a specific target it raises a few eyebrows. Gene seals a bodyguard job in spite of this. But when the job goes South and the pirates are after the woman he's protecting he has to choose between fight or flight. After getting away from their pursuers the woman reveals her identity and why the pirates were after her. Her cargo is a teenage girl, Melfina, who is more than what she seems. You'll have to watch Outlaw Star to find out the rest...

I remember when Outlaw star came on to Toonami in 1998-1999. At first glance I didn't think much of it but I needed to kill time so I decided to watch the premier episode, ""Outlaw World"". I'll say this...my parents watched Outlaw Star with me and my brother and all four of us were hooked from the first episode...and my parent's aren't even big anime fans! Even after the series had played a few times we were all saddened when Cartoon Network took it off the air altogether. Finally Bandai released the Outlaw Star Perfect Collection Boxed Set. Needless to say I snatched it up as soon as I possibly could. I got to finally watch the series in it's full entirety, uncut, uncensored, and in all it's outstanding glory.

The characters are well rounded and you get to know all of them really well. Watching this series it's hard to tell who the protagonist really is. Each character has a good amount of screen time and dialog that gives you a look into their personas. The villans are kept in the shadows and they only give you enough information on them to know the basics. This gives the villans a very mysterious outlook, which you can tell after watching the series that it was the creator's intention. Very cool, from a writer's standpoint. There is a LOT of character development here  too.

The music for this series is excellent. It's catchy and modern while still fitting the series' futuristic feel. The technical designs from ships, to weapons, etc. is amazing. However the defining piece in this series is, hands down, the Caster gun. Episode 23, Hot Springs Planet Tenrei, was the pivotal episode in the series that explained the origins of the Casters and why they're so rare in the story. Unfortunately Cartoon Network had to completely cut that episode from the TV listings, which was a big mistake. The sound design is incredible. It's more dramatic than realistic which helps keep the action oriented feel. Though there is a lot of dialogue there's MORE than enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. Then just as the episode reaches it's climax you are left with the trademark three gunshot ""To-be-continued!"" (Thankfully with the boxed set you won't have to worry about having to wait a day or more to watch the next episode.) Again, Very cool. The plot is very interesting and keeps you guessing until the very end. That's this series' defining characteristic, the story. It's the most original Sci-fi series I've come across in ages. In terms of originality it even beats out another fave series of mine ""Firefly"".

If you do one thing in your life and you're a fan of sci-fi then  ""BUY"" Outlaw Star. Even if you don't like anime it has a good balance of action, intrigue, humor, and suspense. Outlaw Star is at the top of my list as goes for my fave sci-fi shows.",1150502400,4,3997,4.588235294117647

1749855,5,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star rocks!!!

(SPOILERS!!!)

Well, after going for a second time through the list of the anime collection that I have not bought yet (and I have bought a lot of them) I came over this show. Unfortunately, I did not come across this gold mine sooner. Fortunately, I eventually found it.

The story goes more like this:

The crew of the Outlaw Star, the best (battle) ship in space and a mystery covering it, consists of:

Gene, the main protagonist. Starts up as a bounty hunter and gets in all sorts of adventures and troubles. Strong fighter and an expert with guns.

Jim, Gene's partner, an 11 old smart boy and a hacker.

Melfina, till the final episodes you will not be able to tell what exactly this girl is all about apart from that she is the key for the L-lines. (SPOILER), she will be in love with Gene and Gene with her... you know what it means, don't you? Romance on its way big time, hehehe.

Suzuka, a very strong (and beautiful) Samurai woman who also is an assasin.

Aisha, half human half tiger a like woman, which can transform to a wild animal when pissed off, and super strong.

The space ship computer, Gillian, which has an opinion about everything.

Than we have a nuts professor switching constantly sites.

Hilda, an Outlaw hot bad kick a** female, who `puts' most of the main characters into the beginning of their journey.

Two brothers who are also bounty hunters, the so called Mac Dugle brothers, and create all sorts of problems to the crew.

Gene's male friend, Fred Low, (I have pointed out his gender because this reach guy will be in love with Gene and a muscle woman - 4 times strongest woman of the Universe - will be in love with Fred and wants to marry him) and who will basically constantly borrow a lot of money to the crew of Outlaw Star for repairs etc. (well, if this guy will ever get paid back is another story).

The army.

Killers cut loose who are after Gene's life and not only.

And of course pirates who are after the Outlaw Star, Melfina and to kill Gene; and use some kind of Tao magic.

Guns (called Castors) that can penetrate through magic.

And people die.

The main goal of the story: the Galactic L (or K, if you prefer) -lines. I will not tell you what these lines are all about because it would basically give away the entire story (sorry guys).

The music is very good. The opening song is a pop/rock song while the ending one a romantic ballad (both very good songs).

The animation is very good (compare it with the one of Cowboy Bebop and you will get a very good idea).

As for the dub, I don't know why some are complaining but for me the English voices were actually very good.

And it has a very strong storyline and strong character development. Not to mention the fact that from the first episode the story kicks off and moves so fast that it will grasp you immediately (26 episodes long). The story is a mixture of science fiction, adventure, has a great balance between comedy and drama, action non-stop and of course romance (oh, yes).

Last but not least, Outlaw Star can easily be considered to belong to the same (and equal) category/level of Cowboy Bebop, Trigun etc.

Additional to all it, what I liked a lot was that all the main characters of this series are not whiny or whatsoever. They can life with their pros and cons, are able to get their s*** together and are doing some amazing stuff. Even the females of the crew are some kick a** babes who know how to get what they want and are able to beat people up.

To the most logical question: Is the money worth buying it? Definitely Yes...

To sum up, if you want a strong story, which combines action, romance, comedy and drama, strong character development and characters who are ready to rock from episode one, than this show is highly recommended for you. If you prefer a slow story etc. (something like love hentai), than this show is not for you.

To conclude, I highly recommend this show...

Outlaw Star has an interesting plot and descent animation.  Outlaw Star is a one of a kind series; i have never seen anything like it.  There are pleanty of anime movies/series with ""Giant Robots"" or superhuman powers, but it is not often you see grappler ships and all the mix of things in this series.

Unlike what some of those have posted before me, this show is NOT a nude fest, as a matter of fact, in the entire show, there must be 5 seconds of nudity, nothing bad at all.  This show does not need such things to be enjoyed.

The show has a great storyline, with side episodes that contribute to the characters' personalities, which makes the characters that much easier to relate to.

Finally, this series comes in a nice box, packaged well.  I have absolutely no complaints about any part of buying this dvd, the speed it was delivered, and the quality of the product itself

Outlaw Star is, to say the least, an anime that deserves to be placed on the shelf along with others hits such as Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Gundam Wing, etc. The fact of the matter is that it's entertaining, has a storyline that grabs the viewer, and characters which one can become familiar with. People who find Outlaw Star not enough to be considered worth owning usually don't look at it for what it is. Entertainment. The anime borderlines between being entertaining and 'deep'. Because of this it gets alot of good reviews, and then some so-so and bad ones. But don't be mistaken, it IS a wonderful anime.",1135296000,,707,4.619047619047619
1749862,2,B00006FD99,"This show is not for true anime lovers. It's basically an American Saturday morning cartoon with crude jokes and nudity. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. The main character Gene Starwind is cool, Caster Gun and all, and the concept is original, but that's where it stops.

There is absolutely no depth, each and every supporting character is lame and under developed, nothing is explained, the episodes leave you wanting so much more, and the ending is a total let down. It's got sub par action and a hand full of pretty good action scenes but nothing more.

Don't compare this to the likes of Trigun or Cowboy Bebop, especially the latter. Outlaw Star is simply okay, B-/C+, nothing more. Watch your friend's dvds before you buy this first.",1134864000,8,746,4.687022900763359

The banter bewtween Jim and Gene is hilarious and the subtle romance between Gene and Melfina was just enough to keep the show intriguing.

1749890,4,B00006FD99,"Honestly, this is what i expect of all anime dvd's. The set is very good for the money, being contained on 6 discs, in 3 cases. It also comes with a stylish collectors box.

The series itself is of course great, one i think all action Anime fans should watch. It tells of Gene Starwind, who, on stumbling over an android and a secret spaceship, embark on a journey to find the ""galactic layline"". The series mixes Action, SciFi, and Humor into a very well-balanced Mix, that keeps all 26 episodes enjoyable.

Also, the DVD contains both the english dubs, and original japanese. I find this key to any anime dvd release, as I like being able to watch it both ways. (and of course there are english subtitles). Also, i think that the menu's should be noted as being exceptional, they are very interactive, and look very, very cool.

The Special Features are however sparse, only limited character bios, a textless ending/openining, and drawings. But, then again,  what do you want for less then 50$.

The only thing that made me give this 4 stars, and not 5, was the rather low resolution of the dvd's. The dvd looks very sharp on a regular tv, but on my laptops computer monitor, It is very grainy and sliglty pixelated, I expect slightly better from my dvd's.

About 3 or more years back, I caught this on Toonami, and their Midnight Run. I really liked it, so, after more than a year, I finally got around to buying it, and man, it was even better uncut, and from then on out, I loved it! And jeez... On Toonami, they so HEAVILY edited this Series, it wasn't even funny... Even to the point of cutting one whole episode out of the Series. That episode held quite a bit of meaning for the Outlaw Star Series, and was definitely one of the best, and funniest episodes throughout the Series. And all I have to say to all those Anime lovers, Otakus, and such... Just buy it as fast as you can. This Anime is only 2nd to Bebop. My age rating for it is: 15+ (Graphic Violence, Profanity, Nudity, and Sexual Situations). Beyond superb.",1122249600,35,938,4.396551724137931
1749892,5,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star, when I first saw it, came on Toonami and midnights on saturdays. They started showing it...ugh..years ago!! And it would be better if they continued to show it! well, that's life.

Anyway, this movie basically moves in on Gene Starwind, a gunslinger and a nearly fair mechanic. He has a very strong fear of going to space because his father died in space. He and his father were being attacked by space pirates. His father saved him by throwing him an escape pod, while his father was left to die.

Gene hangs around with Jim Hawking, an expert mechanic. Jim and Gene go on a mission with this girl that Gene knew, name was ""Hot Ice"" Hilda. Around Gene's age, she has some mechanical inhancements and one eye (however she lost one eye I have no clue). The three arrive at an area where a special kind of treasure was hidden (not treasure as in..gold treasure), a bio-mechanical being was found by them, a girl. She's something of great value to the pirates (again, another mystery), but Gene couldn't let them take her away, so Gene, Jim, and Hilda save her from the pirates, but Hilda ends up dead in the cause of saving her. Gene and Jim was left with Hilda's ship (whatever the name is) and decided to call it the Outlaw Star, and for the girl, they decided to name her Melfina.

Later in the series, they meet up with a Ctarl-Ctarl leader named Aisha Clan-Clan, an uptight girl who teams up with the Outlaw Star gang, then a fourth member comes in, a samurai that goes by the Sazuka (another girl in the Outlaw Star). The Outlaw Star embarks on missions that are death defying, but they always end up prevailing.",1120521600,2,1629,4.478114478114478

They manage to get hold of one of the galaxies most advanced ships pretty much by accident. The problem is space pirates have been looking for the ship also and want to take because it was built to be able to find the Galactic lei line, which Gene and Jim don't even know what it is. The story goes on as Gene and Jim try to figure out what the Lei line is and how too find it and also trying to pay to keep their new found ship intact and in working order. New members join their team to make an interesting group dynamic. Definitely a worth watch. Some good action, a little comedy (not too much as to be campy). When it ends your left wanting more.

1749915,5,B00006FD99,"One of the more affordable complete anime series out there, Outlaw Star Perfect Collection is a great buy for the quality of the series. Great visuals and especially  nice music. Each episode has the Japanese opening music ""Through the Night"" with alternating (by episode) English and Japanese subtitles, the complete battle music which plays on the options screen (at least on disc 1), and of course Melfina's end song one (episodes 1-13) and end song two (episodes 14-26). A friend told me the opening didn't air when the show was on Toonami so that and the battle music would be a feature all by itself.

The main features, on every second disc, include a textless version of the opening and two endings, artwork, and video previews for other anime series such as the Angel Links spinoff and Gundam Wing movie. They're not numerous, but Outlaw Star itself makes up for that. The English voices sound great and realistic throughout, much moreso than the optional Japanese voices. English subtitles don't always match what's being said - I would guess that they're a more direct translation with the spoken word being altered so that it aligned correctly with their mouth movements; even so, this is not a drawback. Keeping subtitles on provides more insight into the meaning of the words.

This set also includes all the cut areas including the language (the most noticeable of which is an occassional s***), the so-called perverted but not graphic scenes with Gene, and full and partial nudity (full nudity being Aisha in mid-episode 23 and Melfina in beginning-episode 26). Episode 23 ""Hot Springs Planet Tenrei,"" included in the set, has everyone in bathing suits (even Suzuka ;p) and revolves around a sexual plot that would probably suggest why it was originally cut from broadcast. You can tell because the visual text was translated via computer-generated English inserts and the prologue and facial expressions are very noticebly Japanese. However, it does explain the origins of Gene's caster gun and the four special caster shells he uses in later episodes and provides some action for the only member of the Anten Seven otherwise not seen doing anything.

Concerning the storyline, the casual build-up from Gene as a common guy to essentially hero of the universe is nice. Good interaction all the way through though I should note that the storyline occassionally branches off on a tangent; it's nice, however, to get this background information. I'd have to say that my main issues are toward the end during the final battle which doesn't seem to quite make sense (it seems as if it's meant to be symbolic) and the fact that the guy who killed Gene's father escapes without explanation. Other than that, I like the true ending after the final credits which leaves you wishing it would go on forever.

If I had to complain about anything else, it might be that disc 4 of 6 was not properly secured in the case on delivery and so was a little scratched up. While that disc gave me no playback problems, disc 5 of 6 occassionally wouldn't play right with freeze ups or a green screen, but not during playback, only on the main menu thankfully. The problem was alleviated by simply reinserting the disc into the DVD player (I'm not sure if it was the player or the disc). Also, when played on a computer, the quality was greatly diminished with many glitches (esp. sound) using the NVIDIA DVD codec so I'm not sure how it would play if you wanted to use it on a computer or portable DVD player.

Barring these minor problems, this is a great set especially for the cost and I would definitely recommend it to any anime fan ... Despite being Japanese, it's been integrated so seamlessly that it seems very much American and is thus very appealing. 5 stars! :p",1116201600,8,3768,4.78923076923077
1749916,5,B00006FD99,"This series has got it all.  It's action-packed and full of humor and even sweet romantic moments.  The episodes are sequential, so you should get all of the episodes if you want to see the complete story.

The adventure begins when Gene Starwind and his sidekick Jim discover a female android who can maneuver a high-tech spaceship.  The girl android wants desperately to know who/what she is, and Gene vows to help her find the answer.  Meanwhile, Gene must dodge space pirates and bounty hunters who are hunting after the girl and the ship.

What makes this series so much fun are the characters!  There's Gene Starwind - the cocky charismatic bounty hunter, his sidekick Jim - the adorable responsible boy genius,  Melfina - a female android with an indentity crisis, Eisha - a loud, dumb and infinitely strong catwoman, and Suzuka - a beautiful assassin.

The humor can be quite adult at times.  I did a double take a couple of times when I heard some lines that never made it to the Cartoon Network censored version.  You really have to watch the uncut version to fully appreciate Fred Lowe, Gene's gay business associate.  The English dubbing is also excellent!!  I almost never watch anime in English, but this time I actually preferred it in English.  What great casting!

So when she shoved this box set into my hands Monday morning at school, I figured it was just another one of her attempts to get me into anime, which had not worked up until this point. Since she gets kind of wacko over this stuff, I did at least put it on top of my books so it wouldn't be squished (My locker's a jungle, you see).

Later that day, I was doing some homework, when Mel's (kind of a coincidental name) box set fell out of my backpack. Out of curiosity, I turned on the PS2 and popped the first disc in...And the magic began.

When Mel called me later that evening to check and see if I had watched any of it, she was quite surprised: I had watched the entire first disc, and was gearing up for the second. Let me put it in simple terms for you ---I fell in love with this anime.

I beg of you all, don't go as long as I did without seeing this show. It is incredible. Remember, I was no anime fan, up until now. I've purchased this box set for myself, which is quite cheap in comparison to so many others, and I cannot wait until I get to watch this over and over again.

It combines a string of bewilderingly imaginative elements with a compelling, mysterious storyline and an amazing cast of characters. A pirate myth for the space age, Outlaw Star places viewers in a world so expansive and adventure-filled it resonates with the various colonial histories of our world. This anime will remind you of what youth and freedom really are, and make you wonder if you have ever tasted them. It showcases all the best elements of popular anime: humor, action, imagination, and all-around human experience. A great score and nice special features make this an attractive package for all of us anime junkies who hate the profusion of mediocre material on the market right now.

1749919,3,B00006FD99,"There are many nice elements in this show. There are all sorts of characters in the story with differing personalities. It's impossible not to find one that you really like. Also, almost every episode adds some more depth to the plot. There are only a few episodes in which it has no major relation to the main conflict. Even those that don't go with the main plot are fun to watch.

So why did I give the show such a lukewarm rating? Originality. My rating is probably a little unfair since I'm comparing this pretty old show to ones more recent. Still, I never found a real spark, something that made my jaw drop. Combining magic with Science Fiction was very interesting, but there are some really long stretches in which none was shown. I wish more was done with this.

Also, some of the characters are unoriginal- I can't count how many feroucious beast people I have seen in shows in general. Those that weren't unoriginal looked a little odd though, especially some of the bad guys. Who in the right mind would give one of the enemies' sea foam green hair color? Some look like they could blend in with Tenchi Muyo.

I found the plot to lag a little in the middle of the series, too. Not that nothing happens, but I completely forgot about one of the main mysteries in the story since it hardly was mentioned over a long period of time.

I don't want to be too critical about the show. I think everyone should give it a try if they are a space fan. But I can't guarantee that everyone will be wowed enough to keep the DVDs. If you're not too picky like I am about presentation, you'll probably love this show.

1749920,4,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star is a terrific ride! It is a pleasure to watch an action anime series that acutally has a storyline that one can understand. The story centers around a young, handsome, rougish man named Gene Starwind who, through strange circumstances, comes into ownership of the galaxy's most superior grappler ship. His friend and partner, Jim Hawking, a young genious, also accompanies Gene on his adventure and the two meet three beautiful ladies who eventually join them and become the Outlaw Star's crew: Melfina, a bio-android with no memory of her past and the ability to pilot the Outlaw Star; Suzuka, a powerful female ronin with her own score to settle; Aisha, a proud and outgoing ctarl-ctarl with extraordinary fighting abilities.

As a result of Gene's possession of the Outlaw Star and Melfina, he and his friends meet some interesting allies and make some powerful enemies. Some of which include the MacDougal Brothers, whom Gene believes are responsible for the death of his father, and the Kei Pirates, users of strong Tao magic and masters of deadly martial arts. The Kei Pirates were the original owners of the Outlaw Star and Melfina, and will do anything to get them back. They also come across a mystery called the Galactic Leyline that is rumored to be a source of incredible treasure. Nobody knows for sure what it is, but all of the parties involved, including Gene and his crew, are in pursuit of it for their own reasons.

The story is fast-paced and geniunely humourous at times. The space action scenes are very well done, and the music is good. The animation is generally well done with only a few exceptions regarding the character's faces at times. As for the voice acting, the english voice acting was far superior to the Japanese version, which is rare but it happens.

But things go awry, and he finds himself the new owner of the fastest, most technologically advanced space ship in the galaxy. Unforyunately, Its stolen and the owners want it back..

Along with his prtner Jim and the lovely Melfina, Gene must fight his way across the galaxy battling pirates, aliens, and assassins as he attempts to discover the secrets of the Outlaw Star.

Gene's Castor Gun:

 An extremely rare item, The Castor Gun is the product of some very old technology. Instead of firing normal bullets, it fires projectiles called Castor Shells. There are twenty different types of Castor Shells, And each one has a different use.

 The Caster Gun itself is a mixture of science and sorcery. What is actualy contained in the Castor Shells are potent magic spells. When fired, the spells inside the shells are activated by the life force of the person firing the gun. As some of these spells are quite powerful, they draw a large amount of energy, and using several in succesion has proven fatal.

 Since the Castor Gun is a rater uncommon piece of technology, finding shells for it is often very difficult. As a result, Jim is constantly reminding Gene to use them sparingly.

 Yet, despite the dangers and the difficulties involved with using the Castor Gun, Gene still finds it to be his weapon of choice, and it has helped him survive numerous difficult confrontations.

Grappler Ship: The Outlaw Star (Model #: XGP15A-II):

 Grappler Ships are a special type of ship with a pair of large arms attached. These arms were used for manipulating equipment and other objects, giving Grappler Ships a great adavntage in feilds like space construction and mining. However, They were also quickly embraced by criminals as the ship of choice. Soon, Grappler Ships were also being used in combat, and large weapons were developed. Of course, they could also be used in a rather unique kind of hand-to-hand ship combat.

 Grappler Ships have become common, and they range from standard equipment ships to state-of-the-art cruisers like the MacDougall brother's ship, The El Dorado. But the most advanced Grappler Ship is the state-of-the-art XGP15A-II, colloquialli known as the Outlaw Star.

 The XGP15A-II is a special state-of-the-art ship, created by joint cooperation between the Pirates and the Space Forces. Since the Pirates would never had the technology to create such an advanced ship, they used their money and connections to covertly involve a division of the Space Forces. Upon completion, the ship was stolen by the Pirate Hilda and it is now in Gene's care.

 The Outlaw Star is equiped with a state-of-the-art computer named Gilliam II, and employs a special piloting interface using the android Melfina. It also has state-of-the-art weaponary, plasma engines, and other standard amaments and equipment.

1749934,5,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star is truly a great show. Is it really serious like Evangelion? Oh definately not. Is the animation really superb like Blue Submarine No. 6 or Texhnolyze? Not likely. So then why is it good? Simple. Outlaw Star boasts fun and entertaining characters, creative ideas in each episode not seen earlier in the show (it kind of keeps evolving, so-to-speak), and might I add that it also boasts awesome opening and closing songs.

The show begins with Gene, the main character, and his partner Jim. Through an odd set of coincidences over the first handful of episodes, they end up stuck with a prized human/android named Melfina and the ship she can connect to, which Gene titles obviously as the Outlaw Star.

Gene, Jim, and Melfina are joined by two other social outcasts as the show carries onward. The first is Aisha Clanclan, a CtarlCtarl commander exiled from her empire due to her... irrationality? Ya that's about right. Then there is ""Twilight"" Suzuka, a superb fighter rivaling even Gene.

The five come together and travel through thick and thin, from deep under sea with an odd old man to deep in space in the Haiphong Space Race.

The ending gets a little bizarre as the characters near the sought-after Galactic Leyline, but even those episodes are fun and very enjoyable. Ultimately, the show is a smash success easily worth the money for this marvelous 6 disc, 3 DVD case box set. If you need a change from watching intense animes and would like something comical and easy but not stupid, give Outlaw Star a try.",1103673600,4,1532,4.7481203007518795
1749935,5,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star started playing on Toonami back about five or six years ago.  I was just getting started then as an anime collector, and dismissed it as a DBZ, Yu-Gi-Oh, or even a Pokemon type thing.  Unfortunately, I judged it without watching it to any degree.  It played often, so I could hear those annoying voices in my head. I'd always seem to catch a few minutes, while I surfed the channel.  The Jim Hawking to Gene Starwind dialog, it seemed a lot like a Robin to Batman type of talk, and grated on my nerves.  The only thing that hit home then, ""as possibly original"", was some talk I overheard about caster shells.  Bullets that varied greatly in degree of power, even though they were all fired from the same size handgun.

Over the years since then, I've collected as much of the best quality anime titles, subbed or dubbed that I could afford.  Now I've nearly gotten to the point where I must wait for new series to be packaged, so I revisit some of the past ones, just to see if I missed any.  I came across a good rating on ""Outlaw Star"", so I tried a few more sites, and found that sentiment to be consistent.  What did I miss?  Unfortunately, Outlaw Star has long been off Toonami or Adult Swim, and I'd have to buy the series to check it out further.  Fortunately, its dirt-cheap compared to many 26 episode series for sale.

Ok, so what's the verdict? Well as you can tell from my rating, I messed up badly by originally passing over this series!  The collection of characters drive a story where, like the ""Heroes Journey"" in literature, give them life-changing purpose.  Gene grows from a slovenly bum to a substantial man.  Along the way, he overcomes his space travel phobia, and the haunting events of the past that caused it. Each of the other characters finds, and overcome personal challenges, that stretch them to their very limits.  One thing that aids this, and affects the viewer is that we have no nice, nice type of PC anime.  Characters are injured, some die, ships are destroyed, and space is a portrayed as a very dangerous place in which to travel!  Not just because of Kai Pirates, but asteroids, black holes, and other dangers.

Another good plot device to help make it real for me was the cost of space travel.  Maintaining, repairing, and outfitting a ship is not something you can do with pocket change.  Many have compared this to Cowboy Bebop.  This is probably because they both involve a group of diverse characters that have a similar mix of communication.  While it shared some elements of reality in its vision of a future.  The goals, plot and motivations were completely different. Still OS stands out on its own merits.

If you're gonna try to rent this first, try the episode:  Cats and Girls and Spaceships (#20).  It has an excellent blend of humor, irony, and human feelings, all of which transcend a mere anime plot.  Another good one is Hot Springs Planet Tenrei (#22), a funny, fan service episode that still had some important plot elements, and it should not have been left off the Toonami showings. It's actually the only episode I remember which explains caster shells.

I don't really remember enough about the Toonami showings to confirm this, but I don't know if they left in the narrative prolog for each episode.  Voiced by the guy that does Jet in the Bebop series (I think), his voice over gives an important intro to each episode.  Its especially effective for character introduction, often explaining the motivations of the new characters that would otherwise take several episodes to figure out.  The high quality box set includes six DVD's, two each to a DVD case.  Packaging tends to be better than most of the full series boxes I've run across, especially at these low prices!",1099612800,111,3750,4.614803625377643
1749936,4,B00006FD99,"I first saw Outlaw Star several years ago when it was aired late-night on Cartoon Network's ""Toonami."" Outlaw Star singlehandedly got me addicted to anime.

The six-disk Perfect Collection contains all 26 episodes of the series, perfectly preserved in DVD quality. That's ALL 26 -- including the hot springs episode, which was of course dubbed 'too hot for tv.'

Outlaw Star is an action show on the outside, but a thoughtful one on the inside. It touches on concepts of purpose and existance in the character of bio-android Melfina, who is constantly searching for information about the meaning of her existance, and the purpose for her being. Also among the cast is our main character, Gene Starwind. He's a space-phobic type, having had an extremely jarring experience as a child which kept him firmly planted on the ground ever since. Jim Hawking is far too smart for his age -- 10 years old and far more mature than Gene. He's definately the brains of the operation, and if it weren't for him, Gene would be long dead.

The plot is vague at first, when Gene encounters space outlaw ""Hot Ice"" Hilda. Gene is thrown into a battle for the mysterious and powerful spacecraft: the XGP15A-II. He discovers the ""navigational system"" of this ship in Melfina, the bio-android. Later to join the cast are cold and calculated assasin ""Twilight"" Suzuka, and crazy (former) Ctarl-Ctarl General Aisha Clanclan. (Yes, it's another cat-girl.)

Living by no set of rules but their own, on a tight budget (=P) and constantly hunted by the space pirates, this cast of characters is sent into a thrilling and engaging quest of the galactic Leyline and the very meanings of existance.

OLS may sound like a typical space show, but rest assured, it isn't.",1097971200,8,1738,4.858108108108108
1749937,5,B00006FD99,"I'm a fan of Cowboy Bebop and heard that Outlaw Star (which came out in the year 2000 before I was an anime fan) was much like it but better. So when I go to the local anime shop and they do not have Cowboy Bebop: The Perfect Sessions I notice this box set. Agaist all my better judgement I blow $50 dollars on this mysterious DVD and watch it. And to be frank it is not as good as Cowboy Bebop.

It's better.

It has Cowboy Bebop grade action bit with much better dialague, character development, and an actual plot. You will grow to love the characters such as Aisha, Gene, Melfina, Suzuka, Jim, Fred, and Gelium. It has humurous moments such as the Strongest Women in the Universe episode where he has to dress up like a women for a job. And serious episodes such as when Harry MacDougal (one of the 3 main badguys) falls in love with Melfina. One thing you must know though is an Outlaw is not a criminal in this series. It is someone with a ship who is not a Pirate or a Security Force member. Kinda like a mercenary... but not really a mercenary... Its hard to explain. Anyway, the overall story is a mysterious women named Hilda hires Gene to protect her and Gene unwittingly agrees not knowing he is protecting her from the Kai Pirates (not a good thing to get on there bad side) and eventually Hilda dies leaving Gene with a highly advance ship called the Outlaw Star, not to mention Melfina a women grown in a test tube to link directly to the Outlaw Star and offer navigation to a mysterious treasure called the Galactic Leyline.

1749938,5,B00006FD99,"When I first saw Outlaw Star on Cartoon Network I was extremely impressed, but I realized that many things were left unanswered. I can't complain about the series, but there is one problem with the anime. It only runs for 26 episodes!!! Very short!!! I have heard of talks of Outlaw Star 2 and an anime movie but I am pretty sure there isn't going to be either since the creator is busy with other works. It is very disappointing since the series has a very abrupt ending with almost no clue of the future for the characters which is what most anime series try to do. Oh well...

I do have a problem with the vendor who sold me my copy of OLS. It seems to be a dvd burn copy!!! It also doesn't look anything like the picture on amazon.com which makes me suspect a fraudulent business even more!!! Also some of the episodes had glitches in which they became almost unwatchable. But I am off topic...

If you decide to buy this anime I don't think you will be dissapointed. Just don't pay over $50 for it because you might regret it. If you enjoy this series you might also enjoy Cowboy Bebop, Gundam Wing or maybe even Big O which all aired on Cartoon Network. That's all from me :)",1091404800,,1181,4.267857142857143

If you've seen a lot of anime, you won't see any new concepts in Outlaw Star - but you'll love watching it just the same.  The action is incredible, the characters are rich and well-developed, and the plot is compelling and twisty.  Sure, it's the got the archetypical ""fly by the seat of his pants in a cool spaceship waving a magic gun"" kind of hero (and he's even got red spiky hair,) an android who is desparate to find out her past, a child prodigy hacker, a samurai assassin, a spastic female were-tiger with revealing clothes, and of course the prudent AI ship's computer, (not to mention a varied cast of space pirates, law enforcement, bandits, outlaws, bounty-hunters, etc.), and they're in search of something with an extremely mysterious name (""galactic lay line?""  Come on!) Sounds like the same old anime thing, right?
Think again.  Even if you've seen a million animes that sound just like this, you've never seen it done so well as Outlaw Star.  The coolness factor is through the roof.  A perfect blend of spectacular fantasy and Heinlein-esque realism.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",1088208000,,1355,4.687763713080169
1749940,4,B00006FD99,"Gene Starwind, (the main character) saw his father killed when he was a child by ruthless pirates named the Macduggal Brothers. Gene grew up and became a bounty hunter for hire. He aquires a unique spaceship called the, Outlaw Star, which has a navagation system provided by the android, Melfina. This ship is the only one able to find the coordinates to a great mystery known only as the Galactic Leyline. Gene Starwind is joined by an interesting crew; Jim is a computer hacker, Susuka is an assassin, Aiasha is a beast girl, Melfina is an android who has human feelings. They all embark togther on the quest to the Galactic Leyline. Gene also has a score to seatle with the Macduggal Brothers.  I enjoyed watching Outlaw Star very much. The story flows well right from the beginning when each character is introduced. The characters themselves are fun to watch as they have their own charm and personalities. The group does a lot of traveling between cities and planets. They meet a host of characters both good and bad. Gene Starwind is adventurous, funny and deadly- he is a good example of the swashbucking hero. He also posses a gun called a, Caster. The interesting thing about the Caster gun is the it shoots shells which contain magic spells from- magna-. So this Quasi fantasy and science fiction element makes it more interesting. The ship itself is interesting as it contains an artificial intelligence on board and intereacts with the crew. The ship-to-ship combat lacked intensity found in other anime titles. A big part of that fault was the low framerate, low detail designs, and having the ships fight with grappler arms. So yes, it was strange to see ships holding hands and punching each other. The character design and animation were average, it just lacked the fluidity of high quality anime. The sound effects and music were also average. These are just minor complaints I have. I personally liked Cowboy Bebop much better, but Outlaw Star was a lot of fun to watch, the storyline and characters were good and this is the basic foundation of good anime.

1749965,5,B00006FD99,"If some of the reviewers of this show strike you as a little immature, don't let that turn you off from this very good adventure series with substance as well as action.
This show's plot has a certain trait that not all shows possess, even in the generally-superior writing we see in anime.  That trait is character development.
Outlaw Star has been compared to Cowboy Bebop, with Bebop being generally considered better.  But read Charles Solomon's candid review of Bebop on this site, and see the part about character development.  The characters of Bebop, such as Spike, are generally static, whereas there is definitely development of OS's main character, Gene.
So while Bebop has the edge in style, soundtrack, and animation, I have to say that the ending to Outlaw Star is very much more fulfilling.  You finally realize at the end of the last episode that Gene really has changed (how, of course, I will not say).  But it's an inspirational moment, to be sure.  There are very few shows that left me feeling so satisfied.
I also want to point out that the first episode isn't very representative of the series as a whole.  The entire tone lightens up after around ep. 4, which is actually appropriate in retrospect, as it is at that point that Gene begins to leave his gritty, earthbound life for the wonders (and dangers) of outer space.
A reminder, to parents and younger viewers, that this is not the more kid-friendly show aired on Cartoon Network.  The content in Outlaw Star, if airing in theaters, would be rated at least PG-13. But I highly recommend it for older teens and up (younger viewers won't fully appreciate it anyway).",1082592000,4,1643,4.7403508771929825

Everything just seems to go downhill from there...
Highs:
Fun, interesting, and well-rounded characters; well-done plot; good animation for the most part; almost always interesting; a little of everything
Lows:
Sometimes goes off-track; inconsistent animation; some undeveloped characters
When I first saw a cover of an Outlaw Star video back in the day of two-episodes-per-video-subbed-OR-dubbed (all you newbie anime fans are spoiled with your newfangled DVDs), I saw a badly drawn guy holding a gun and immediately dismissed it as a ""guy with big guns"" anime.  I had no interest in such things, so I passed it up and spent my precious money on something much more worthwhile: ""silly martial arts"" anime!  (Read: Ranma 1/2)
Well, a year or so later, Outlaw Star was going to be shown on Cartoon Network.  I was still a bit skeptical, but I had nothing better to do so I decided to watch it...and immediately fell in love.  Well, maybe ""in love"" is a bit extreme a word.  But I did like it enough to buy the whole series on DVD.
The first thing about this series one may notice is the animation quality.  It's good for a 1998 TV series.  The character designs are original and attractive, everything moves fluidly, and the colors are bright and clean...for a while.  Midway through the series, the animation quality immediately becomes very inconsistent.  The style changes from episode to episode, ranging from the quality that the series started with to mediocre.  Also, the space battles are some of the more interesting out there.  Grappler combat is far more visually exciting than the stationary ships shooting at each other with lasers that can be seen in, say, Tenchi Muyo.
Secondly, the plot is multilayered and interesting.  In fact, it has many plots within one.  The most obvious are the search for Melfina's origin and the search for the Galactic Leyline, but there are other, more subtle plot strings that I'll allow you to discover for yourself.  While most episodes have something to do with the plot, there are a few occasions where it seems to go off-track, becoming more about the search for money than anything else.  Nevertheless, there is a good balance between action, drama, romance, and comedy.
The third and possibly most important aspect of the show is the characters.  Fortunately, Outlaw Star excels in that area as well.  Gene Starwind, the protagonist, is at first your classic badass womanizer/bounty hunter with a tragic past, but he is as well-rounded as any character by the end of the series.  Jim Hawkings, too, is at first a stereotypical precocious child-genius sidekick.  He's the more responsible of the two and tries (often unsuccessfully) to keep Gene on task.  There's also Melfina, the sweet and mysterious bio-android whose past they are searching for.  Unfortunately, some of the characters are not developed as well as they could have been, and the pirates are never anything more than evil for the sake of being evil.
More interesting than some of the main characters are the background characters: Fred Luo, the young, flaming queen of a merchant who is in love with Gene and is always providing the crew of the Outlaw Star with money and supplies (and driving them deeper and deeper into debt).  One of my favorites is Harry MacDougall, one of the villains.  He is completely obsessed with Melfina and is the picture of a potentially abusive boyfriend.  On multiple occasions he tries to kidnap her, starting with kind words, then getting frustrated and hitting her with the bouquet he brought for her.  And we can't forget Gilliam, the Outlaw Star's computer, who has just as much personality as any of the more biological characters.
Topping off the series is a strong dub.  It is directed by Wendee Lee (who plays Suzuka, the samurai-assassin) and is definitely one of her better jobs.  Robert Wicks is perfect as Gene, Brianne Siddall (credited as Ian Hawk) sounds astoundingly like Michelle Ruff, and nearly everyone else gives a standout performance.

True, Cartoon Network edited their version to fit their guidelines, but, I got enough of what was going on to try and find the show on DVD.
  Other anime series may be more in depth, some a little more funnier, but very fue can combine those two elements well enough to be any good. The relationship between Gene Starwind and Jim Hawkings is a great example. Here, you have two completly differented minded characters who seem to have nothing in common, yet they still work together to accomplish what they set out to do. Throw in the likes of the android Melfina, the ship itself, Asia ClanClan and Suzuka and you've got a great mix of characters.

Gene Starwind dreams of a life off his planet but he, and his partner Jim, are stuck doing half-... odd jobs for pocket change. But then he and Jim hit it big time when they get hired for a great job. Of course the job goes awry, a nice understatement, and things go from bad to worse. Yet, as the story rolls along, not only does Gene end up with a great ship but also a crew of highly skilled and loyal crewmembers. The pilot Melfina, the assassin Suzuka and the alien catgirl Aisha all join in the search for the Galactic Leyline. They better watch out, because they are up against not only the MacDougall brothers, but other outlaws, pirates and the natural dangers of space.

1750007,5,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star, an awsome anime seris. What else can be said? The first time I saw it was on Cartoon Network ( i am always on the prowl for new anime). The Cartoon Network version well, is awful compaired to this version. It has both English and Japanesse versions. Also for once, this is a very well dubbed anime.
The story's protagonist is a twenty year old man by the name of Gene Starwind. He owns a repair shop on Sentinal 3, with his eleven year old partner, Jim Hawking. When the receive a mysterious job offer, from a strange woman, the duo are launched into an adventure that they weren't in the least prepaired. The woman reveals herself as ""Hot Ice"" Hilda, a widely acknowleged Outlaw. She uses Gene and Jim for their help in getting a hold of a mysterious bio-android named Melfina, and the grapler ship the XGP15AII, or the Outlaw Star as it is latter named.
But another group is also after the ship, the Kei Pirates, and soon the Mcdougall brohters are also after the android as well as the ship. After a furious battle, Hilda dies, but both forces are defeated, and the Outlaw Star is in the possetion of Gene Starwind, Jim Hawking, and the bio-android Melfina. Yet Melfina is more than what she seems, she can access the ship's computer controlls, and serves as the navigator.
To pay for the expensives of the Outlaw Star, Gene uses his gay friend. Fred Lou is one the most hillarious characters in Outlaw Star history. If you are offended by this kind of thing, well you might not like the 5th episode.
As their adventures continue, two more members join the cockpit of the Outlaw Star. Aisha Clann-Clann, or the Ctarl Ctarl Empior,and the assasign ""Twilight"" Suzuka. Their many adventures produce a large quantity of humor. But soon the crew of the Outlaw Star soon finds themselves once again being presued by the deadly Kei Pirates, the Mcdougall Brothers, and a crazed scientiest name Gwen Khan.
Will the crew of the Outlaw Star survive all the death traps that has been layed for them? And what is the secret of Melfina, and the Galactic Leyline? You have to watch to find out.
Sound wise, this is everyhing you can expect from any anime seris. Akino Arai preforms the ending theme songs, which are awsome. There are some amazing visual effects, that are breath taking. This is well worth the money",1040169600,,2317,4.585542168674698
1750008,5,B00006FD99,".............. drum roll.... and SUNRISE wins again. This collection of DVDS is one of the greatest I've ever seen. Everything blends perfectly, including the music, which many said was not up to par. This set follows the classic practice of the American love of ninjas, honor, nobility and such things with the Japanese sweet tooth for cowboys and lone wolves. Captivating, wonderful, angering and sad all at the same time. It never reaches a level of confusion or overdoes the cowboy half like you often see in this genre of anime, such as often happens in shows like Cowboy Beebop, and others. Good for all, maybe 12 and up.",1038268800,,627,4.761467889908257
1750009,4,B00006FD99,"Plot: It's the future, people have colonized other planets, and have space ships. There are two major forces, the law and the pirates, and those who are neither are referred to as outlaws. The story follows Gene Starwind, a red-haired guy with a cool star tattoo who by chance becomes the pilot of the Outlaw Star, the most advanced ship in the galaxy. The problem? The law, the pirates, and one very pissed Ctarl-Ctarl (a race of cat-people) are after him, asking about the Leyline, but Gene has no idea what they're talking about. Gene and his friends (Jim - a boy good a fixing things and Melfina - an android who is the ship's navigator) have to solve the mystery of the Leyline before the pirates do. There's also a funny character Gene goes to for weapons, Fred. An assassin hired to kill Fred, Twilight Suzuka, ends up traveling with Gene.
My thoughts: A great show, great characters, well worth watching. This unedited version is better than the editied stuff shown on American TV. Gene is great, Jim is great, Fred is hysterical. Gene's tattoo and castor gun are pretty cool, the Outlaw Star itself is pretty neat. I like the opening sequence, the closing sequence seems a little slow for the show. Aisha (the Ctarl-Ctarl after Gene) gets on my nerves, but that could have a lot to do with her dubbed voice. Gene's dubbed voice is great. Hilda (one of the characters in the beginning of the show) has the same voice as Nuriko from Fushigi Yugi, but it wasn't that noticeable. I haven't watched it subbed yet (I always watch the dubbed version first) so I can't comment on the Japanese voices.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending seemed a little abrupt, it seems like there should be something more there. It didn't count against the show, but I also don't like Gene's haircut at the end... why couldn't he have kept his hair?
Not for kids, I would say 13 and up.",1037577600,3,1885,4.514619883040936
1750010,4,B00006FD99,"While Cowboy Bebop is by far superior, don't overlook Outlaw Star just yet. While the animation isn't top-notch like Bebop, it is sufficient. Also like Bebop, has some good, if not, memorable action scenes. Granted, it's no Face-Off or MI:2, but it is cool. Also, the space battles are cool as well. My other complaint is the stupid editing. Otherwise, this should belong in any otaku's anime library. Semper Fi!",1036108800,,412,4.9
1750011,5,B00006FD99,"The first time I ever saw an episode of Outlaw Star was on Cartoon Network's Toonami Midnight Run. I forget what episode it was exactly, but it caught my eye in a flash. This is coming from a guy that never even glanced at anime UNTIL he saw an episode of Outlaw Star.
Gene Starwind and Jim Hawking start the series on the planet Sentinel III, a backwater world on the fringe of space that has no particular importance on the galactic scene.  As the owners of ""Starwing & Hawking Repairs,"" they get a call from a woman named Rachel Sweet, who needs a bodyguard.  They quickly figure out that Rachel is only a cover for the infamous outlaw ""Hot Ice"" Hilda, as they begin to be chased by Kei Pirates who're after Hilda.  As the first episode ends, Gene and Jim have yet to realize that they are at the beginning of a long journey that will change them forever.
Gene Starwind is, in essence, a frat guy.  He's 20 years old, loves to drink, loves women, and tries to have fun most of the time.  He often acts half his age though, and it causes him to get into quite a bit of trouble.  When he comes into possession of his ship, the Outlaw Star, he immediately sets into motion a plan to use the ship for its original intent: to find the Galactic Leyline.  He may be just an amateur bounty hunter, but Gene's luck and natural skills help him in more than a few sticky situations.
Jim Hawking is Gene's polar opposite and partner.  Unlike Gene, Jim usually acts twice his age, but still enjoys being 11 years old.  He is cautious, very intelligent, quick-thinking, outgoing, an excellent mechanic, and is always on Gene about how they lack money and where they should get it.  He is never one to actually fight battles himself, but rather, provides backup and support for Gene whenever he is needed.  He treats Melfina like a mother, and looks up to Gene
Melfina is a bio-android who is a mystery even to her creator.  She looks human, acts human (eats, sleeps, breaths, has emotions).  Physically, she is only 2 years old, but she looks like she is 17, and has pieces of alien biotechnology in her dating back over 30,000 years.  However, she acts more human than some of the human characters in the series, despite the fact that she was created by Gwen Khan.  She was built specifically to be the navigator for the Outlaw Star, and comes along on the journey because Gene promised her that they would both discover why she was created.  In the later part of the series, Gene realizes how much he cares for Melfina, and vice versa.
Aisha Clan Clan is a proud and loyal Ctarl Ctarl (half human, half tiger, as Jim describes).  Strong-willed, very direct, and very aggressive, Aisha is not the type of person to mess with.  She is naturally strong, but can undergo a transformation where she turns into a tiger, giving her even more strength but with a set time limit.  She lacks finesse and one of the more comedic characters of the cast, but her pride will never let her live down any embarassment.  She becomes a crew member of the Outlaw Star because of her fierce loyalty to the Ctarl Ctarl Empire; she promised to find the location of the Galactic Leyline so the Empire could claim the ""treasure.""
The last crew member is Suzuka, otherwise known as ""Twilight Suzuka.""  She is well known because she is an elite freelance assassin who always kills her target just as the sun sets, and dresses in traditional Japanese robes.  Weilding only a bokuto (a wooden sword), she originally was hired to assassinate Fred Luo, but Gene prevented her from doing so.  Gene and Suzuka fought later on in the same episode, with Gene being the victor; of course, Gene couldn't kill a woman, so he made Suzuka promise that if she was going to kill Fred Luo, she had to kill Gene first.  She later joins the crew of the Outlaw Star because she finds them to be very interesting, but her true intentions are revealed in the final episodes.
Probably the primary reason I bought the DVD version is because the Cartoon Network version is HEAVILY edited (for example, they replaced made bad edits such as this one from Episode 4:
Harry: ...really hot?
Harry: ...really cute?
This might just be in place to not offend any of the female audience, but its things like this that I didn't particularly like being cut out (in addition to some scenes that were just randomly cut out that had NO possible offensive content).  Consequently, Amazon.com got my business because I wanted to see a better version of this great series.
This series was DEFINITELY worth the money. I wouldn't rank this as being #1 anime series of all time (Cowboy Bebop takes the cake  =P), but it isn't a series to pass up.  Some people might point out a weak plot or character flaws or animation.  The plot is great.  The characters blend well together.  Animation in some parts of the series may be lacking (like panning across a cel instead of showing any animation).  The only flaw I particularly noticed was the music.  A lot of the tracks are repeated in some parts that they don't seem to fit in (okay, Cowboy Bebop spoiled me with its excellent music soundtrack), but otherwise, they're great (Suzuka's song and House of Moon are great tracks).  Overall, this series is (I'll say it again) quite excellent.  Check it out if you get the chance.  : )",1035158400,13,5300,4.519916142557652
1750032,5,B00006FD99,"I was wathcing this anime once and after the first five minutes I was hooked. Before I even knew the name of the series I was hooked. This is such a great series, once you get this, it will be your favorite anime, too.
I'm not sure what some of those other people were thinking - bad music!? Whoever said that, I pity you. Outlaw star's soundtrack is excellent, every song played ties perfectly into that scene. The dialogue is great - though not perfect. There are a few lines I would have changed, and even laughed at because they were so out of place, but that was very rare. Every episode is very funny; Gene Starwind's carefree, comedic, and often impetuous attitude add a lot to the show. His comments are always hilarious, especially when he argues with his partner Jim Hawking, the ship's mechanic and resident computer wizard. Then there's Aisha ClanClan, a Ctarl Ctarl - race of cat-like people that are very strong and often stubborn  that can shapeshift into powerful tiger beings. Aisha does not like the crew of the Outlaw Star and is only with them because she wants to impress the empire and get the rank that Gene made her lose back. She often makes fun of Gene and Suzuka (Suzu to her). Though later she develops an older-sister like relationship with Jim Hawking. Then there's Suzuka, a quiet assassin-for-hire that gets stuck with Gene, and used him and his conflict with the Kei Pirates to settle an old score with her archenemy, who I won't mention.
Outlaw star is packed with action and comedy, from fighting the evil Kei Pirates, foiling powerful Tao Priests, battling the deadly Anten Seven to the death, or simply evading Aisha's vengeful wrath, there's plenty happening in the episodes to keep you wanting to see the next one, and then at the end...feeling sad that it's actually over.",1034726400,15,1812,4.6625

1750034,5,B00006FD99,"This is the anime you have been waiting for. It has all the greatest aspects of animes, such as spectacular space battles and an undying love between guy and girl.
The story takes place in a universe filled with order, but where there is order, there must be some disorder. Space pirates exist only to rob other ships or collect bounties. This is the ideal life for Gene Starwind, the main character of the story. He wants to become a space pirate, and to start he is in search of what is thought to be the most prized treasure in the galaxy - the Galactic Layline. No one knows what it is, but after Gene meets Melfina he makes a promise to her that he would help her find out who she is. Strangely enough, the answer lies in the Galactic Layline.

I would highly recommend this DVD collection to any major anime lover. People that like ""younger"" animes, such as Dragonball Z and *chuckle* Pokemon, would not like this one very much, but people that are into more serious animes (Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, etc.) will absolutely love this show. Action, humor, and love all come together in a perfect combination to form Outlaw Star.",1033084800,,1128,4.5024390243902435

1750037,3,B00006FD99,"I really didn't expect a whole lot from Outlaw Star, but, as it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised.  While it's true that the show hasn't an original thought in its head, it manages to put the cavalcade o' cliches together into a decent enough, if not spectacular, whole.
I think that the show's biggest asset is its utter lack of self-consciousness--it doesn't even make a token effort to be original, but somehow that works to its benefit.  Look at Melfina, for instance.  Get this: she's an android discovering what it means to be human (there's also a bonus cliche involving amnesia, but we'll let that go).  When Captain Tylor did that, I cringed.  But here, somehow (thanks in part, certainly, to her oh-so-earnest English voice actor), I was able to accept it.  And then there's Aisha, a--gack--catgirl who can only be described as ""feisty.""  Annoying and tedious?  You would think, and yet somehow she manages to steal essentially every scene she's in (thanks in large part, again, to her excellent English voice actor--is it clear by now that I highly recommend the energetic dub over the too-subdued Japanese?).  And the MacDougall brothers are good antagonists, especially the younger, whose spoiled-rich-kid persona is highly entertaining.  As for the others...well, Suzuku, the assassin girl, doesn't get much to do, and Gene himself might as well be replaced with a sign saying ""plucky Buck Rogers-type goes here""--neither of them is unlikable or anything, there's just not much to them (though the interactions between the latter and his partner, the eleven-year-old Jim, are sporadically amusing).  Furthermore, some of the scenes with Fred Lou, the flamboyantly gay outfitter who finances much of the crew's adventuring, are borderline offensive  all I can say regarding the areas in which the show is lacking is a hearty ""whatever.""  The only thing about the show that consistently annoyed me were the horribly inane intro narration bits that came before each episode.  Other than that, it's all good, moving along at a good clip and culminating in an okay ending.  Not earth-shattering, not hugely memorable, but if you want a pleasantly undemanding space opera type thing, you could do worse.",1030924800,3,2216,5.099722991689751

1750039,3,B00006FD99,"Outlaw Star is a decent anime. I have seen worse, much worse.  The animation isn't breathtaking, but it doesn't impede with the storytelling. The last few episodes are rushed badly. Too much was crammed into the last two episodes. Other than those two, the series runs smoothly, slightly slow at times. The characters are funny, the voice actors are great in English, but Jim's Japanese voice is very annoying.

So for an overview: animation=decent, voices=very good, plot=very good, characters (minus Melfina)=great, overall=very good. It is definately not the best anime out there, but it's a nice series.",1030838400,,607,5.247422680412371
1750040,5,B00006FD99,"This series is often referred to as an action/sci fi, with little attention paid to the comedy. Although it is indeed an action/sci fi series, comedy abounds and perhaps because some viewers lack a sense of humor or a comedic wit they can't appreciate the show in all its comedic value. At times, I found myself appreciating the humor more than the action or the story, but I am not inferring that the latter is mediocre by any means. The action scenes are great as they are filled with pretty intense fighting (whether they're gun fights, ship fights, etc.) This isn't even half of what Outlaw Star has to offer, though. The plot is pretty good, but the ending had me a little disappointed because I felt as if something was missing. You know what I mean? It's the same feeling when Gundam Wing was finished, but then all the loose ends were tied up with the release of Endless Waltz. Well, it would be nice to have the ""Endless Waltz"" for Outlaw Star just to expel the ambiguity and ambivalence that this series left inside of me. Perhaps the ""to be continued"" at the end of the last episode was an intimation for a concluding three or four episodes that were never created. At any rate, I was satisfied enough with the ending to not ponder any further and to conclude that everything was fine and dandy in the Outlaw Star universe. I find nothing to complain about with Outlaw Star. Voices, story, characters, everything essential to an enjoyable anime are all present and are ready to take you for a 26-episode ride that will leave you satisfied.",1029628800,5,1550,4.559139784946237
