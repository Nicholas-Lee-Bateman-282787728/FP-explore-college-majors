8343587,3,B001UFE8PC,"This is a clean, family-friendly movie.  Obviously low-budget, so the acting is very cheesy much of the time (the supporting cast especially), but its still entertaining.  Some scenes honestly didn't even make sense - they were apparently intended to be humorous, but there was no large-scale purpose for them.  My main complaint would be that the beginning of the movie was much too slow (the backstory of why the actress needed rehab and ended up in Utah) and then the rest of the movie happened so fast it didn't even flow well.  The best thing about it was KC Clyde's character, as well as Erin Chambers.  I wish there had been more scenes spent on their relationship and back story.",1294444800,2,687,4.691666666666666

8343589,3,B001UFE8PC,"This is a fish-out-of-water story set in Utah by the usual LDS genre suspects...but without the LDS angle.

The movie starts off pretty weak with some horrible acting.  Characters on the Hollywood side are outright cartoonish.  But once our Hollywood diva escapes rehab (don't act surprised that she escapes...it says so right on the box), everything goes warm and fuzzy, and we've got a pleasant little love triangle (quadrangle?) between a best friend, a diva, and a yodeling psycho.

There's no foul language and almost no alcohol (it IS a movie with a rehab bend for Pete's sake!) It's adorable, harmless, and will leave you smiling.  Hey...Michael Birkeland is in it.  What could POSSIBLY go wrong.",1244332800,3,703,5.017241379310345
