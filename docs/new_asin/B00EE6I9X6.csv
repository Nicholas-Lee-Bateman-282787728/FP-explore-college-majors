8604573,5,B00EE6I9X6,"I love this series and their musical numbers! I am like the other fans and I wish that it would release the whole complete series!
I don't want extra features so it's good there isn't any on this? I can't really remember because honestly, my eyes always skim over extras. I don't care about extra features and extra features usually make me hate the series when i learn more than i want to about what the actors were thinking.

THe cartoon is not ""Cheesy"" It kind of bothers me when people say ""Cheesy"" because what they really mean is ""The cartoon does not have any swearing or violence so therefore it is cheesey""
I'm glad this doesn't have any of those things.
I can safely put this DVD on for a group of kids while us adults go about our things and I don't have to sit and screen this show first to make sure it's something I want kids to see.
That can hardly be said about most TV today.

Donkey Kong is a very decent show to let children watch.",1397174400,,950,4.214285714285714
8604574,5,B00EE6I9X6,"This DVD has some pretty great episodes! As with the rest of the series, the animation isn't always perfect, but some of the musical numbers are fantastic. There are not really any special features but if you like Donkey Kong then you'll really enjoy this DVD. Keep in mind, this show was produced in the late 1990's, it is not a new program. Hopefully we'll eventually get a complete series release of this show.",1387929600,,413,4.594594594594595
8604575,2,B00EE6I9X6,"I bought this DVD and got it for a good price but I guess it's also called you get what you paid for.

Here are the features:
-4 Classic episodes on one disc
-a reversible cover one side in English and one side in Spanish
-The Quality is much better than the first volume

The bad:
-The DVD says there are Subtitles in English and Spanish but no subs are present.
-The Disc Menu gives you only 8 seconds to make a selection.

I give this DVD release a 2/5 cause I also agree so far for Volumes 1 & 2 I paid a tital of $13.95 I want the complete collection or at least the complete first season released.",1381968000,6,603,4.008333333333334
8604576,2,B00EE6I9X6,Stop doing what WB is doing with Smurfs here in the US and just release the whole complete seasons of DKC for Nintendo fans!,1378771200,5,124,4.208333333333333
