7873754,5,6304534345,"The story, acting, etc. in Burning Paradise does not quite reach the grandeur of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  For example, the acting and the romantic subplots aren't one bit as compelling.  However, on its own merits, this is an excellent martial arts movie with a very effective gothic horror edge to it that makes it unique.  The setting is mostly inside of a temple/prison filled with traps, wells full of bodies, and pits of flame representing as close an approximation of hell anyone could create on earth.  Captured Shaolin monks who manage to fight their way past ruthless guards just find themselves impaled by snares.  The temple is run by a sadistic old man who follows the old philosophy ""it is better to rule in hell..."" who also keeps a collection of dead girls.  The scenes where he is painting images of hell or threatening the young heroine are extremely chilling. However, he makes the mistake of imprisoning the hero of the story who, of course, attempts to free the young maiden and all of the other captives in fighting scenes which are almost as good as anything in Crouching Tiger (and far more believable).  The action keeps the more horrific aspects of the movie from overwhelming the audience, and it has a few moments of humour as funny as anything in Iron Monkey.  But be prepared to see some slightly more graphic violence.",1007942400,,1356,4.764957264957265

The main character here is named Fong Sai Yuk,but believe me this character has  absolutley nothing to do with Jet Li's character(this guy is a shaolin  monk) so I don't know if it is a different interpretation of the hero or if  the name is by coincidence. Anyway this is a good movie for any of those  people who complain about chinese humor(which I enjoy) or any other  silliness in Kung-fu movies because there is none here,just a straight  forward serious tone script about a group called the Red Lotus Sect who  enslaves monks in their temple. On the downside though this movie takes  place all inside the temple after Fong is captured by the sect,so this  movie really reminds me of Dragon Inn where the movie takes place in all  one environment,good thing this movie encorporates alot of action which  saves its dreary setting and the fights are very plentiful,the fights can  be a mixed bag though,while some are staged perfectly others in-between  seem as though they slacked off a bit, but as a whole the action gets at  least a good B grade,a great aspect of this movie though is its special  efects(no short budget here)alot of great pyrothecnics,none of the stab the  fake dummy tricks,and alot of awesome looking dismemberments and flying  projectiles which show this movie was no cheapo production. In all I enjoyed  this movie, but actually like movies that can at least be light hearted for  a few minutes and would have liked to see more scenery,but if your into  more serious movies this is the one for you.",959644800,,1672,4.622448979591836
7873756,5,6304534345,"Burning Paradise stands on it's own as an unique piece of HK movie magic. The hero of the story is the legendary ""Fong Sai Yuk"" a rebellious and headstrong shaolin monk. The story revolves around the  attempts of the ""Red Lotus Clan"" to wipe out the ""Shaolin  Temple"". A Deadly Prison laden with traps is built by the Clan's  leader as a symbol of hell and the monks are captured and imprisoned  therein. The movie deals with the monks attempts to escape and contains  some great characters. The Clan's leader is a mad artist (the actor who  plays him is an artist in reality) and other Clan members include a traitor  from the shaolin camp that must battle ""fong sai yuk"" and a  female ninja type of guard who loves him. The cinematography is slick and  their are some great action sequences and character development, lot's of  fire is incoporated into this ""living hell"" making for many  dramatic scenes. This film was made with a very high budget in HK terms but  lost out at the box office - perhaps due to some rash comments Ringo Lam  made about the Tianneman Square massacre which were misunderstood/taken  badly by the public at large who decided not to see his movie.  All in All,  ""Burning Paradise"" should be seen by any fan of Hong Kong Cinema,  it's a good story with plenty of adventure, romance, tragedy, betrayel etc.  - add it to your basket!",944611200,,1360,4.549586776859504
