1809472,5,B00007G1YH,One of the best documentaries on Egypt I have seen. Concentrating on the specific time period of the new kingdom with outstanding recreations and full of up to date information. Very well done!,1416441600,,193,4.878787878787879

1809477,5,B00007G1YH,We found this on the PBS site under an Egyptian studies lesson plan.  My daughter watched it for part of her sources materials on her 6th grade Egyptian society report.  She did extremely well on the report and said this video had very complete and detailed information that was key to her success with the paper.,1413676800,,313,4.571428571428571

1809496,5,B00007G1YH,I thought I had seen all of the educational videos about Ancient Egypt but somehow I missed this one.  It's very informative like those produced by the History and Discovery Channels.,1407974400,,183,4.903225806451613
1809497,3,B00007G1YH,A fair overview of important historical periods.  Very good presentation of Martin Luther's passion.,1407888000,,100,6.142857142857143

1809511,1,B00007G1YH,childish and absurd - boring,1405382400,,28,4.8
1809512,4,B00007G1YH,"This is an interesting documentary by the History Channel about the Egyptian pharaohs. Descendants of Ramses and Ramses II changed the traditions of the kings we call pharaohs. One in particular brought monotheism to the people of Egypt. ""Egypt's Golden Empire"" gives an excellent historical account about the way RA became the one god worshiped, at least for a short while. The video also illustrates how the history record of pharaohs was erased from the stone monuments. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys ancient Egyptian history.",1404172800,,543,5.181818181818182
1809513,2,B00007G1YH,"Boring and slow. Some interesting info, not much.",1403913600,,49,5.25
1809514,5,B00007G1YH,"I can not recommend any and all of the Empires series enough. Egypt's Golden Empire is no different. I have never been let down by the Empire seasons, you don't have to be a history nut (like me) to enjoy these episodes.",1401235200,,220,4.261904761904762
1809515,5,B00007G1YH,"Enlightening, mysterious and very entertaining. A solid panorama of Egypt and it's past. Learned so many new things Well done!",1401148800,,126,5.35
1809516,5,B00007G1YH,This was an interesting and very well done historical documentary.  The reenactments and cinematography held my attention through all the episodes.,1398902400,,147,6.0
1809517,4,B00007G1YH,Season 1 was captivating. There was lots of information about the empire.  Season 2 was somewhat less so. Worth watching still.,1398729600,,127,5.0476190476190474
1809518,5,B00007G1YH,I found this to be an excellent series for those who are history addicts. It's very interesting and informative. I loved it.,1398470400,,124,4.681818181818182
1809519,3,B00007G1YH,"Having just read a fascinating series of novels called  ""The She-King"" by L.M Ironside, I was interested in some more information about the actual history of Hatshepsut and her ""family"". Egypt's Golden Empire did give some more extensive information about that whole era, including the geographical extent of the empire, but it was a bit skimpy about the Tuthmosides and the Amunhoptets. It was good to see some of the archeological sites and the video was very good about Ramses II. Also, there was a bit too much repetition of people running and hammering with chisels.",1396656000,,571,4.947916666666667
1809520,5,B00007G1YH,Egypt's Golden Empires is worth viewing. The extended view of a longer time period gives a great perspective. Helps tie the pieces you know together.,1396483200,,149,5.0
1809531,3,B00007G1YH,"There was no reference to the pyramids and towers of the cities of the plains like Sodom and Gomorrah, which also contained libraries of the MEN AND WOMEN OF LONGEVITY, who also had life spanning hundreds of years, some recorded in the Holy Bible..",1393545600,,248,4.659090909090909
1809532,4,B00007G1YH,"I love history so know a little about Egyptian history. I did enjoy this series though-there was a lot of detail I had not heard about before. Some of the video is repetitious, but that's par for the course in these kinds of productions.",1390867200,,237,4.409090909090909
1809533,5,B00007G1YH,I liked this program and learned alot from it. I love history and this was history at it's best. I learned why all the gold was stolen from the graves of the kings. Now I know and no I will not tell. hahaa.,1390867200,,206,3.813953488372093
1809534,5,B00007G1YH,"Easy to understand; laid out in a succinct, clear manner.  I wish there were more Empire documentaries, because I would watch them all.",1389830400,,135,4.869565217391305
1809535,5,B00007G1YH,Excellent review of the egyptian past; the entire empire series is great. Great for middle school kid as a history lesson,1389571200,,121,4.809523809523809
1809536,5,B00007G1YH,Interesting to watch. I enjoyed the shows and learned something about ancient history in that time period. Now I want to visit Egypt and to see all these magnificent monuments with my own eyes.,1386460800,,193,4.705882352941177
1809537,5,B00007G1YH,This is a very good and educational look at the founding of post-pyramid empires in Egypt along with many sociological changes wanted by Ahmenhotep IV (Akhenaten) attempted that we take for granted today.,1383350400,,204,5.212121212121212
1809538,4,B00007G1YH,"i found the series informative, but rather ""introductory"".  Having read some ancient history already, I would have liked more detail and greater depth, but I am grateful to see even rudimentary summaries put out there to educate folks who have had little or no exposure to the subject before.  It would be absolutely GREAT for young students!  Enjoy!",1381104000,,350,5.0
1809539,5,B00007G1YH,There was so much to learn and enjoy I this series. The photography was breathtaking and you could feel present thousands of years ago. A stellar program,1380412800,,153,4.703703703703703
1809540,5,B00007G1YH,"What I enjoyed about this special of Egypt's Golden Empire, was that they used real opinions by famous Egyptologists and by people who specialize in the history of Ancient Egypt. In addition in this documentary there were video dramatizations to give you a real sense of  what they looked like and/or felt. And by felt I mean that they used real accounts by the Ancient Egyptians themselves. Lastly, the details in ALL OF THE VIDEO SERIES are all ACCURATE. But other than that I always and will continue to enjoy EMPIRE specials!",1379203200,,529,4.75
1809551,5,B00007G1YH,This is a very.well done interesting series. This particular episode was fun to watch and the scenery and narration excellent. Will eventually catch them all . Most of this episode focused on Ramses just wish it was longer so more info on other subjects could have been addressed.,1378944000,,280,4.854166666666667
1809552,3,B00007G1YH,"Nothing earth shattering to set this above other documentaries on Egypt. However, the show is entertaining and informative... Worth a try if you like ancient history.",1376524800,,166,5.423076923076923
1809553,4,B00007G1YH,"I have a large DVD collection on the Egyptian way of life, so when I picked up this DVD I was expecting to see a lot of old pictures and film clips from prior DVD's  I am happy to say there is many items not seen in the other DVD's that can be found on this DVD.  For example it goes into more detail about the life and times of pharaohs Ahmose and Hatshepsut. Also, some good educational information about the early development of Egypt as it was on the verge of being eliminated by armies to both the north and south. I recommend it for the educational folks out there.",1376092800,4,571,4.135135135135135
1809554,4,B00007G1YH,This four hour documentary on the Pharaohs of Egypt is well written and narrated.  It spans from the unification of Egypt to the rule of Ramses the first.  This is the same series that Greece: crucible of civilization comes from.,1373760000,,229,4.7
1809555,5,B00007G1YH,"If you like all things Egyptian, this is certainly a documentary that you'll want to add to your watch list ... beautifully filmed and interestingly told.",1372982400,,154,4.961538461538462
1809556,4,B00007G1YH,Thought it was a good basis for things and the documentary wasn't too drab like most tend to be. A bit repetitive with scenes though.,1372550400,,133,4.36
1809557,5,B00007G1YH,"I love these types of historical informational programs.  The narrator is very good and as always, the information is fascinating.",1370649600,,130,5.5
1809558,4,B00007G1YH,The only shortcomings were it was a little hard to get a timeline in my head. The other was the narrative seemed a bit monotone at times.,1368921600,,137,4.111111111111111
1809559,5,B00007G1YH,Really enjoyed this series.  I love to watch everything related to ancient Egypt.  This series did not disappoint.  Worth a watch,1366761600,,129,5.0476190476190474
1809560,5,B00007G1YH,"Very informative and artfully done. I like the narration and the material. Easy to watch, well done, enjoyed watching it.",1366329600,,121,5.1
1809582,5,B00007G1YH,"Great in depth coverage of an ancient time, over 1000 years BC. A marvelous story of a wise ruler who carved out many years of peace in a time seemingly before civilization when contrasted with the Roman Empires that followed.",1364515200,,226,4.675
1809583,5,B00007G1YH,"I am completely satisfied with this DVD. The history, the depictions, detail in scenes.  A very welcome addition to my library.",1361404800,,127,5.0476190476190474
1809584,4,B00007G1YH,Recently had a trip to Egypt just before the turmoil and this series did a great deal to suppliment my trip. Well done.,1361145600,,119,4.217391304347826
1809585,5,B00007G1YH,"I've enjoyed this one very much.  Smart, colorful, entertaining.  An interesting presentation with colorful examples of history. I will keep this one on my shelf and revisit it often.",1358380800,,183,5.275862068965517
1809586,5,B00007G1YH,"I thought this was a first-class treatment of a critical period of Egyptian history. I had no complaints about the music or the staging, in point of fact I thought they were rather good. Maybe because I listened to the narrator's words and focused on the storyline, I failed to discern the defects others have mentioned. I found it factual and well presented.

1809625,4,B00007G1YH,"This DVD is a good introduction to the history of Egypt's New Empire period. Most of the interviewed scholars make insightful and accurate commentaries.  The two exception I would point out to is when they speak of Pharaoh Akhenaten, of whom they present the conventional, questionable views of a fanatic, incompetent king;  and secondly when they refer of the relationship between Queen Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III, attributing to the latter the erasing of the Queen's name and images from certain monuments without having proof of the matter. Other than this are remarkable the many dramatizations and the shots from the monuments, works of art ( most of which are the originals ), and  the compelling storytelling of a long history. If you really like Ancient Egypt or would like some nice introductory stuff this is a good choice.  But keep learning more and make your own conclusions.",1118448000,37,890,5.034013605442177
1809626,4,B00007G1YH,"In preparation for my upcoming trip to Egypt, I rented thirteen different films about ancient and modern Egypt. This particular entry, from PBS, was my favorite. It was informative, well-produced, and did a great job of covering the sweep of New Kingdom history.

Of all the videos and DVDs I watched, this was the highest quality, and probably the only one I would want to purchase for my own collection.",1108944000,11,405,4.785714285714286
1809627,4,B00007G1YH,"This is one of the better Egyptian documentaries, if only because it has a (relatively) narrow topic: the New Kingdom.  Many Egyptian documentaries simply cover the famous monuments and people of 3,000+ years; in effect, saying very little and bombarding the market with redundant shows.  However, despite its focus on just the New Kingdom, it does treat the topic very broadly.  The New Kingdom was an extremely long and complex period in Egyptian history; as a result, this documentary focuses on a small number of people and does not give a sweeping overview of the entire period.
There are slight narrative problems with this program.  I will highlight one as an example.  In part III, which is primarily about Ramses II, the narrative jumps from the death of Tutankhamen to the ascension of Ramses II, presenting a misleading chronology in which it appears that Ramses II actually followed on Tutankhamen.  This is hardly the case - four kings came between them (Ay, Horemheb, Ramses I, and Sety I).  At the very beginning of Part III, the interviewed scholars focus on ""Ramses"", by which they mean Ramses II.  They speak of his non-royal background, and though it is true that Ramses' family was non-royal, it was Ramses' grandfather (Ramses I) who actually initiated the dynasty.  By the time Ramses II came to the throne, his father (Sety I) and grandfather had already reigned, so he wasn't quite the non-royal usurper that the DVD seems to imply.  This is not the fault of the scholars being interviewed - they are all legitimate and well known Egyptologists - but rather of the editing, which tends to conflate a number of kings into one person, making it seem as though Ramses II began the 19th dynasty directly after Tutankhamen, and completely omitting the last two kings of the 18th dynasty, Ay and Horemheb.
This is one of the more noticeable of the misleading issues in the two-hour program, and I cite it as an illustration of the fact that you cannot view these programs as 100% foolproof academia - much is being omitted from history for the sake of convenience and entertainment value.",1099353600,42,2106,4.841225626740947
1809628,3,B00007G1YH,"A fascinating look at the Egyptian Empire, but there are certainly better ones out there. Some very nice footage, though often shots are repeated, such as running 'couriers.'
A serious con for me was the major overuse of the same 'Last of the Mohicans' theme. It was used over, and over again, often, I found distracting from what I was watching. Perhaps because I'm a soundtrack nut though, the music stuck in my head too much. And there were only three or so pieces of music used overall it sounded like. I think I've heard the Gladiator theme used on another documentary like this as well.
I also found that music was used too often in this documentary. It's important to know when to use music and when not too. Would it have been too much to devote a little more of the budget to getting some different pieces of music created.
Keith David is a great narrator and takes his time, providing a welcome balance to the overused music.
Again, good visuals, informative, and the stories are pretty easy to follow, but with a bit of tweaking, this could have been a really great documentary.",1081209600,7,1089,4.561224489795919
1809629,4,B00007G1YH,"The ""Empires"" series on PBS has has several great episodes.  This is among the better ones.  Egypt's history spans thousands of years, and to make a reasonably-lengthed DVD (and to fit in with the general parameters of the series) this one simply covers the New Kingdom -- a brilliant moment in Egypt's long and glorious history.  So while we don't see anything about the pyramids (already a thousand years old by the New Kingdom), we do see some of the most interesting (and popular) characters who lead Egypt at its peak of power...  Thutmosis, Hatchepsut, Akhnaten, Rameses II.  Nice touches like the inclusion of correspondence bewteen Egyptians and foreign leaders and discussion about the life of commoners helps round things out.  All in all, visually interesting, great fun, and lots of good info make this a great documentary.  Highly recommended, but those drawn to Egypt by the pyramids or, say, Cleopatra should look into other DVDs.
And I should point out to a previous reviewer that ""corn"" doesn't just refer to the yellow vegetable we all know and love... the word has long been used to refer to any generic food crop, similar to the word ""grain.""",1074643200,19,1162,4.868020304568528
1809630,4,B00007G1YH,"It's pretty.  It's pretty much conventionally PC especially regarding Hatshepsut.  Also, in the Thutmose III segment, we find out that the people of Megiddo had corn -- as in maize -- according to the documentary makers.  I had a little chuckle at their expense, shame on me.

Zahi Hawass speaks earnestly about the greatness of ancient Egypt, how the Hyksos were expelled by the Egyptians without help -- not mentioning of course that the only Egyptian account sez that there was an ally who did most of the work, even though the account is quoted.

The show glosses over the abject defeat of Ramses II at the battle of Kadesh, but that's not (toot) uncommon.  Kent Weeks, the excavator of KV5, says that it was a ""terrible, terrible military mistake"" to take the word of the two captured Bedouins, who were planted by Ramses' adversary.

There's a discussion of how Ramses II account of the battle was a work of ancient propaganda, but still the show claims that the pharaoh snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat.  The whole battle was a disastrous defeat, and Ramses II didn't attack the ""Hittites"", he fled on his chariot from the field, leaving half of his army (2 of the 4 divisions, in modern parlance) to be slaughtered.

Ramses' treaty (concluded a few years after the battle) with Nebuchadnezzar ceded Egyptian claims to Asia, and accepted a daughter of the king as one of Ramses' wives.  The ""Hittite"" king didn't have to accept one of Ramses' daughters, and though young, he lived a long time and fathered at least 100 kids.

This video deals in a conventional way with the New Kingdom, and includes various popular hotspots, such as the overthrow of the Hyksos (muddled though it was), Hatshepsut (ditto), Thutmose III's ingress of Israel, the Amarna period (ditto), and the reign of Ramses II ""the Great"", up until the ""Sea Peoples"" invasion under Ramses III.

Of course the show suffers from its reliance on the conventional pseudochronology.  Still worth a look, especially if one likes aerial shots of the Sahara.  ;')  I'd not mind having a copy of this one around the house all the time.
