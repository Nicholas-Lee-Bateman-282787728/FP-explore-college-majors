841825,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is a cult classic worthy of the title! Welcome to the seediest underbelly of the 1990's Scottish youth. You really get a feel for the wild and sometimes inane mundane moments that plagued the daily lives of the Scots. Danny Boyle goes to great lengths to make you believe that you are living the day to day life with this ragtag group of friends.

Infamously, Trainspotting may also serve as a drug PSA like you have never seen other than perhaps Trainspotting's extreme American counterpart Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. The drug trips are terrifying in disjointed nightmare fuel sequences shot with such a clever cinematography and vision that you will never forget these scenes. It may scar you for life or scare you away from drugs forever. Either way, you will be completely engrossed during the substance abuse scenes.

However, Trainspotting is not by any means preachy or forced, nor is it dreadfully dour or bitterly melancholic. Trainspotting is a wildly fun and very often hilarious ride with the boys. You will get to know each of these extremely entertaining characters like they are pals of your own. Ewan McGregor leads this wonderful ensemble cast as Renton. He's earnest, messed up, lonely, and yet hopeful. Robert Carlyle is an absolute menance to society with his thick Scottish accent and tough guy legendary performance as Begbie. Ewen Bremner's character Spud is a lovable dope that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

Sick Boy, played by Jonny Lee Miller, is more manipulative while also a strange buddy of Renton's. Tommy is so earnest and ends up being a much more complex figure through the excellent portrayal from Kevin McKidd. Lastly, Trainspotting introduced the world to the charming and spunky tour de force that is Kelly Macdonald. The cast is simply unforgettable! I found myself really relating and rooting for these strange fellows.

Notably, the movie has a very famous soundtrack that put punk icon Iggy Pop back on the map for the general public with Raw Power and ""Lust for Life."" Other punk, alternative, techno, and electronic tunes scatter your senses throughout the film. Danny Boyle picked some good ones. You'll want to check out the soundtrack after you see Trainspotting.

So have some laughs with the occasional nightmare and watch Trainspotting. It's a really memorable blast! Personally, I'm going to check out the sequel to see if it compares to Trainspotting.",1506988800,,2444,5.009852216748769
841826,5,6304297912,One of my favorite movies. It is Sad but Doyle does know how to make it a little easier to swallow. Once again an amazing performance by Ewan McGregor. This movie is funny... but also dark maybe because it is so real and true everything addicts do is kind of explained in the perfect way. This Movie takes you threw a life of young teen/adult addicts. And what it takes to survive on and off the drug with the right touch of motivation and fear. Great music and truly one of a kind.,1506816000,,482,4.193548387096774

Their lives:  their involvement in drugs and crime is their attempt to escape or carve a different road for themselves in a class ridden society.  The surprising role of Begbie adds violence and humor to a very dark scene.

841907,5,6304297912,"This is the best movie with one of the worst messages and oddly enough it makes me feel good.  If I EVER had the thought to do Heroin, I do not now! (I never did.....I'm too scared of needles).  The only reason you're considering buying this is cuz you already like this movie and no one needs to sell you on it.  However, the commentary is great! There are deleted scenes as well, but I just watched the whole thing with the commentary on and I love it even more.

So with that, ""YES THAT'S A ""8#$@%  DANCER!!""  (right??  yeah??? did I do that right? come on you know.....when Ewan's character Renton gets his opium suppositories from the toilet!!)  Whatever, just buy the stupid thing.  Max OUT!!",1497571200,,698,4.433070866141732

841989,5,6304297912,"At times absolutely hilarious, others down right disturbing. I tend to be a very sensitive person but I forced my self to watch it all the way through. This film is brilliant work. It depicts the insanity of this world and enables a person to view life through booze soaked/drug induced self deception through chemical escape.

The horror of alcoholism/addiction and that of the psychopath Begbie is flawlessly rendered.

This is part of a mad world that we live in. It is reality and true.

There is a way of lucidly enduring this planet though and that is a persons own deep spirituality. Be your own peaceful loving spiritual warrior that dissolves the way of life that this film depicts, that is the way out my fellow brothers and sisters. I know because I live that way of spirituality on a daily basis and for over two years leaving alcohol behind.

A good film for the recovering alcoholic or addict to see.",1496448000,,914,4.6234567901234565

841996,3,6304297912,"I did like this movie, quite a bit actually, but it's not for everyone.  As other reviews mention, it's kind of the 1990s British version of the Outsiders.  The first half of the movie is dominated by needle/drug use, if that's not your fancy, skip to the last half of the movie, you won't miss much of the plot.

Understanding the spoken words by these Scottish punks was difficult for this American small town kid, mostly due to the thick accent, as well as, lots of regional slang that was mostly lost on me, but I was able to get the gist of what was being said.  But, it gives reason to watch this more than once...I suspect that is what has elevated this 20 year old flick to cult status.  I have just watched this for the first time, this week. I had never even heard of it before.

I liked the cinematography, the images of run down buildings, and the over feel of misery...really it's great Art.  I believe overal, that this movie is well done for what it is and I enjoyed the story line, but 80% of the drug use in the first half of the movie seemed gratuitous to me...hence the downgrade to 3 stars.

As to this DVD set, There have been a few different releases, I always seek out films with lots of bonus features/featurettes.  This one (Directors cut, collectors edition) has a lot of bonus features/featurettes.  If this is your type of movie and if you are like me and like all that crap, , , this is definitely the DVD package you want.",1493424000,3,1452,4.305147058823529

842051,5,6304297912,"I did not see this movie when it came out originally, 20 years ago, because it seemed to be marketed so specifically to people who identify with heroin use. (Not my thing.) However, I have recently seen a trailer for the sequel, Trainspotting 2, and I was intrigued so I thought I would give the first installment a try. Glad I did. It is more of a cautionary tale than I imagined it would be, and did not at all idealize drug use. In fact, it was unflinching in its depiction of the nightmares that result from addiction. It was an eye opener for this admittedly naive woman.",1492819200,2,576,4.342592592592593

842942,5,6304297912,"While I would say that this film's present day status is as the film that put Ewan McGregor on the map, it is, naturally, so much more than that.  It's a film about a group of listless, angry, and disenfranchised addicts living life.

This movie doesn't glorify drugs.  A lot of media at the time of both the book and film's release accused it of such, but I don't see it.  A lot of the character do drugs of various kinds in the film, yes, but it's never portrayed as something that is helping them in any way.  Actually, there is a major plot point devoted to one of the main characters attempting to kick heroin, and is responsible for probably the most famous moment in this film.  So no, this does not glorify drugs at all, and it's probably not going to normalize any of the negative behavior that you see in this movie, just because you've seen it in this movie.

Anyway, as far as the actual film goes, it's very well done.  It's an intimate and personal film for the characters involved, but it doesn't feel like a cheap film just because of that.  And even though there's a lot of character dialogue, it never gets boring.  There is always something going on, or something to lead into with the plot of this movie.

There are also reasons to care about the characters.  And while the characters do tend to fall into archtypes, there's enough actual personality to them to actually make them feel like real characters, instead of what they need to be for the sake of the plot.

The cast as a whole does a really good job of bringing these characters to life, and everyone just feels real.  Though the accents might be a bit impenetrable on your first viewing, this is also somewhat by design.  The book famously has all of it's character dialogue written in dialects too.  It's all part of the story.  Even if you don't get it, you'll likely get the gist of it anyways.

While it's the drug use that's really front and center in this film, it's really the characters, their lives and interactions, and motivations that drive this film.  It's just a nice intimate character film when you remove the overall framing device of the drug use.  And in the end, it's one of the best films of the 90's.",1453248000,7,2203,4.419354838709677

Recreational marijuana is like beer, but without the thirst quenching.  Is it a reward?  You get the munchies afterward and probably any food tastes good.  Yet, being drunk on beer is probably worse than being stoned.  Anyway, you got these people whose main interest is in heroin and getting high.  They describe the feeling.

The movie follows a motley group of friends in and out of various states of heroin addiction and the deception, thievery and utterly irresponsible acts they perpetrate as they float through their days only aiming to keep their next fix at the ready.  Though it can be hard to watch in some scenes, it offers plenty of raucous and funny moments.  Check it out!!",1436140800,,599,4.467889908256881

843269,5,6304297912,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the film.

The film is energetic, fast-paced, and full of animation.  Regardless of whether you like Renton, you are immediately absorbed by him and his friends.  Renton's morals are questionable.  He is conscious enough to say the right things, but you see the alarm on the judge's face when he tries to be sincere.  His parents are full of hope.  But there is pure ecstasy on his face when he shoots up, so nothing else in the world matters - everything is at peace, and he is in love with everyone and everything.

I loved the dialog - and most of all the humor, because there is a lot of humor in this film.  The drug dealer given the moniker Mother Superior; Begbie's irrational fuse.  There is Sick Boy, who loses his heart after the death of his daughter, and sweet Spud, who is a follower and gets into cause trouble because of that.

Ewan McGregor is marvelous as Renton.  His nervous energy is just right, and he spews his lines with zest.  But all the actors are credible.  They make their character endearing, charming, and even funny.

This film is very different, and I appreciated its kinetic ambitious style.  I never seen anything like it.  The dark gloom, a sweet schoolgirl, a tepid home setting.  The film did not condemn.  It did not preach, though there were certain things that were tragic.  But it opened up this eccentric group's life, and it was both appalling and hard to turn away from.  Not just a car accident but a bomb, which hypnotized the mind with its scenes of destruction.  The malevolent characters charismatic with their destructiveness.  You get involved.  You want to know what happens next.  Regardless of whether you like the characters, you want to know what happens next.

843335,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is an unusually realistic movie. Theres no sugarcoating as it presents the awful truths of drug abuse and addiction. Its a nasty brutish tale told through the legitimate and uplifting context of youthful exuberance. Because thats how drug addiction works, you have to be youthfully strong (or at least stubborn), hopeful, and naive to stay on such a losing path. The result is a story of dark humor and hilarious ironic mirth as we watch a horrifying march to bad ends. This is some of Ewan McGregors earliest work, and its Kelly Macdonalds first film. Both are beautiful and brilliant, glowing with youth that blithely explains bad life choices. Robert Carlyle plays a psychopath who bizarrely fits into his low society so well that he becomes something of an older and wiser mentor to his mates who pump heroin into their veins. The whole film is a glorious saga of a social train wreck. The only shortcomings of Trainspotting are practical. The film is set in Edinburgh, so nearly everyone speaks in thick Scottish accents. Be prepared to rewind and read captions in some critical scenes. And of course, be prepared to be disgusted, because heroin addiction is disgusting. Trainspotting is funny and smart, lyric and poignant, thoughtful, exciting with an incredible soundtrack (including Iggy Pops Lust For Life), enthralling, and even somewhat hopeful in key scenes (possibly including the end). But the overall impression is disgust and despair at lives wasted. True stuff. Watch this movie.",1431302400,22,1511,5.096774193548387

Set in a low class part of Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1980s, this film revolves around themes of drug addiction, betrayal, illness, and poverty.
Trainspotting is certainly not the type of movie to watch if you need cheering up and an extra dose of optimism.  The film details the consequences of the characters' mistakes extremely bluntly; therefore, I do not recommend this to anyone with a weak stomach.  It does have its moments of well-fit in British humor, and at many points, we simply want to dish out hugs of sympathy to some of the characters.  Two thumbs up to Jonny Lee Miller's amoral, Sean Connery obsessed character, ""Sick Boy.""

In the film he plays a heroine addict (probably the best portrayal by an actor) trying to kick the habit. He finds it is near impossible as his former heroine buddies continue to pop back into his life.

 The film may be difficult to watch for some as the director and producers certainly did their homework in detailing the lives of drug addicts and people's struggle to get off them.

 The movie is hilarious in some parts (prepare yourself for the breakfast scene with a family when a man comes into the kitchen with ""dirty"" sheets) and and downright emotional when an infant child dies due to the lack of attention by its drug dependent parents.",1389484800,,729,4.716535433070866

In Space Odyssey , Kubrick in fact uses the music to accompany the images but a profound silence would do as good. Here the music constantly raise us, like a drug that the viewer would administer to himself without rule nor reason.

Then we have the junkies's culture. It may be rather grotesque , it is a superficial, an external perspective on drug nevertheless succeeding to communicate a certain energy , a collective delirium, grotesque and funny situations . Although, there left something ridiculous and childish in acting. The roles are exaggerated and everything turn around the central character Ewan who should be considered charismatic , I think.

Till this absurd end where everything is mixed . In a cynical and ironic tone, Ewan decides to comply to consumer society and to permanently abandon to take drug.

eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly.  Not to mention a
bevy of superb, brave performances.

This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of
Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"".  Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional worlds (drugs, porn),
but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clichs and makes us relate to these characters as
human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts.  These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality,
without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds
 around them.  You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them,

 (spoiler ahead!)

Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic.  Yes Renton is walking
away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about
money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs.  To me, that's what the whole, chillingly
 `choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about.  Truly `choosing life' is about a lot more than just
saying `no' to drugs.

Not to mention the title `Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected
hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by.  Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning
away from living life just the same.",1377388800,4,1719,4.920138888888889

844340,4,6304297912,"To be blunt, this is not an easy film to watch. I took the chance because of the brilliance of the director, Danny Boyle, who has helmed such cinema classic as ""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""Sunshine"", ""127 Hours"" and ""28 Days Later"". Slumdog is the first Bollywood movie to be a hit in Hollywood. Sunshine is one of my favorite SciFi films on the 2000's, 28 Days Later is mentioned with the best Zombie movies on nearly every list of best Zombie movies and even 127 Hours manages to make that well known troll, James Franco, look decent and like an A-lister. Let's face it, Danny Boyle has the golden touch.

Based on that AND the fact that Trainspotting is getting it's own sequel called ""Porno"", I decided to give Trainspotting a shot. I do not normally watch movies about drug addiction. It hits too close to home and I don't find it funny. Nobody comes into this world saying proudly ""When I grow up, I want to be addicted to heroin."" The thought of having to rob people just so you can buy  drugs so that when you wake up in the morning, you have your morning fix. All that just so you don't start off the day sick. Or that you steal from family and friends until you have no family and no friends, to me, that is depressing and I tend to watch movies that lift my spirit, educate me or scare the hell out of me. I justified that this one met criteria #2 and #3.

Like I said, this film is not easy to watch. You are bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort. You may well get sick just from watching. As he has shown again and again, Danny Boyle is brilliant, but I would prefer not to watch his vision of Ewan climbing into the grossest commode in the long history of cinema (well done, Scotland!). The thing is it does not condescend or patronize. It exists and I will never watch that scene again.

I found this movie disgusting and brilliant. How you will take it, I suppose, depends on where you are in the world and what your experience has been personally or perhaps with a family member and their relationship to addiction, intervention, confrontation, tough love and no love. Addiction is a terrible thing. Trying to capture it on film is auspicious. I applaud and curse your efforts. Now go to A&E and watch the last season of ""Intervention""",1371168000,,2266,4.4268585131894485

844343,2,6304297912,"I am one of a small handful of people that pretty much disliked this movie. I gave it 2 stars because it has some uniquely creative aspects to it, but I do not care for the basic style it was made in. The film flaunts it's comic book style absurdity. I would have really enjoyed this film if was told in a serious and realistic manner similar to that of other drug films like Christiane F., which in my opinion is probably the best film about heroin addicts ever made. But generally speaking I really don't care for films that take the serious issues and make them into fantasies. You know- the mannerisms of the story and filming technique that are there to get noticed for their flashy artistry. This is the same reason I hated 'Requiem for a dream'. The film had such a powerful story to tell, so why muck it up with a bunch of silly artistic flashiness? For me this style of film making rarely works. Even Oliver Stone managed to annoy me with some of 'Natural Born Killers', which I did like very much. And I love his films for the most part. Stone did well with artistic imagery in that film and 'The Doors', which I loved. But there is a wackiness to the style of film making here that is similar to a few of Terry Gilliam's movies that I really don't like much. I didn't care for really any of his films either primarily due to this ""fantasy"" style of film making that is used in films with primarily serious subject matter. So far I have absolutely hated nearly every movie Danny Boyle has made except for 127 hours. I much prefer films that have a flair of psychedelia that were made in the 60's or 70's if they are going to be that way. Boyle's style annoys the crap out of me. it's the very thing that ruined Slumdog Millionaire for me. It remains the worst best picture Oscar winner I have ever seen. Trainspotting and films with a similar style nowadays just seem laughable, and they usually give me a first class headache in the process.",1368144000,,1952,4.336065573770492

844461,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. It's funny, sad, tragic, horrific and cautionary too without being preachy of the dangers of heroin. Highly re-watchable considering some of the most shocking and at times potentially repellant scenes to ever appear in a mainstream film. It still is director Danny Boyle's best film to date.

Regarding Lionsgate's blu-ray of Trainspotting, there has been a bit of controversy. There had been a few years back a 2 disc collector's edition of the film which presented it in its international cut that differed very slightly from the American R rated cut. To avoid an NC-17 rating, a couple of seconds were trimmed from the sex scene involving Ewan McGregor's character and a girl he meets at a club. The filmmakers also had to substitute a few shots amounting to only about 3 or so seconds in this same sex scene and also substitute a later shot of a needle breaking Ewan's arm during his overdose scene with a shot of his face instead. To be honest, the slight changes in the American R rated cut are imperceptible unless you've seen the uncut version and even then, it's really not a big deal at all.

For the film's American blu-ray release though, Lionsgate used the R rated version instead of the uncut international version. While I was ever so slightly disappointed in that fact, the positives of this hi-def release greatly outweigh this particular fact. Colors are greatly improved along with much better contrast and detail compared to the DVD. In fact, the blu-ray makes the DVD look positively washed out in comparison. There is a nice filmic layer of grain throughout and I couldn't spot any instances of any digital noise reduction. This blu-ray simply blows the older DVD out of the water and is truly like seeing the film all over again for the first time. Audio is presented in lossles 5.1 DTS sound.

All of the extras from the 2 disc DVD collector's edition were carried over. If you own the prior DVD and are a completist like myself, I just threw away the pointless digital copy and instead kept the first disc of the 2-disc DVD to still have the uncut intertional version. There is a 2 disc blu-ray release in Europe that contains the uncut version but it is region B locked so unless you have a region free blu-ray player, the Lionsgate blu-ray is the best way to go.

While I'm not sure why Lionsgate put the R rated cut on the blu-ray, that is the only thing that slightly keeps this release from being definitive. But it really is a very minor differance. Like I mentioned earlier though, the picture quality is a quantum leap over the DVD and is still well worth the upgrade. Highly recommended!",1351987200,8,2686,4.648421052631579

Over the years, the film has continued to be a great success with critics and audiences, growing a larger fanbase with every passing year. Now, the film has debuted on Blu-Ray so fans can finally enjoy the film in high-definition.

MOVIE:
Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is the narrator and protagonist, a young man who has chosen to live his life as a heroin addict in Scotland. Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Begbie (Robert Carlyle), and the clean-cut, non-addict Tommy (Kevin McKidd) comprise Renton's close circle of friends, all essentially in the same boat as him. The film progresses in a mostly episodic way, following Renton through his heroin addiction, his multiple attempts to quit and stay clean, and the trouble his addiction frequently gets him in. Nearly every scene is an example of Renton getting himself into trouble and trying to find his way out, be it getting in trouble with the cops or accidentally sleeping with a young schoolgirl (Kelly Macdonald). Trainspotting has a straight-forward narrative, but doesn't allow itself to be restricted by it. This is a film that moves with energy and purpose.

With a running time of only 90 minutes, its remarkable how much happens. While it maintains a singular tone throughout, there's a combination of genres within the movie that probably account for its continuing popularity. It's character-driven, with very memorable characters and is very funny at one moment and very tragic the next. It effectively uses surreal imagery, such as Renton's famous toilet-diving scene, while also functioning as a strong drug movie, allowing the characters to romanticize heroin while showing the tragedy that accompanies the use of the drug.

The soundtrack, consisting of both classical and pop music, the brightly colored cinematography, and the overall composition heavily recalls Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. When the characters go to a club, the layout of the club reveals this as intentional. Trainspotting was actually edited by the studio due to the heavy Scottish accents and their fear that American audiences would have trouble understanding them. Well, I admittedly had trouble with them at times but it's all about paying attention (and some extra help from subtitles perhaps). Darkly funny, with memorable characters, a stunning performance by McGregor, and uniquely flavored direction by Danny Boyle; Trainspotting is a pop-culture masterpiece that won't lose steam any time soon.

BLU-RAY:

In case you're wondering, the Blu-Ray looks stunning. I compared a scene from both the Blu-Ray and the DVD on the same 1080p TV and even the most untrained eye could notice a substantial difference in picture-quality. The beauty and color of the film nearly pop out of the screen, however, technical aspects aside, the Blu-Ray is not quite perfect. First of all, it's not the uncut edition which has an extended sex scene and a shot of a heroin needle penetrating a vein. These changes don't affect the plot, but most people would rather see a film in its intended form. In addition, the Blu-Ray's special features are lacking. How hard is it for studios to carry their special features over from previous releases? If you love this film and you want to see it in the most high-definition way, this is worth buying for the cheap price you'll find it for. However, be forewarned that you can probably expect a double-dip in the future.

It's a mixture of the Miramax theatrical and the true Director's Cut. None of the dialogue is dubbed but the two shots edited from the US version (Diane on top of Renton and the needle going into Renton's arm) are not here. Picture is moderately better than an upconverted DVD. If you are looking for the true version seen in the UK and on the Criterion laserdisc, either hold on to your old 2-Disc DVD or seek it out used as it's now out of print. Otherwise, I would recommend paying no more than $10 for this or avoid altogether. I like Lionsgate very much but sometimes they drop the ball.

By avoiding any strident proselytizing or easy judgments and simply portraying the addicted lifestyle in a closely observed, pragmatic style, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge have produced one of the most powerful statements against drug use ever put on screen.

It was funny, disgusting, sad, dark, exciting, bizzare and just plain awesome.

I've seen reviews that say Trainspotting glorifies drug use.  That is definitely not accurate.  Perhaps a twelve year-old would watch this and think, ""Drugs and cussing are cool!"" (BTW most 12-year-olds should not be watching this film), but to an adult viewer, the destructive consequences of drug use are quite apparent.

The music was exceptional and fit the ever-changing mood of the movie.  The scenery from Scotland is beautiful and provides a nice contrast to the depressing state of the characters.  In short, one of my favorite movies ever.  See it.  Whether you love or hate it, Trainspotting is an experience you won't forget.",1276646400,2,1093,4.912568306010929

844597,4,6304297912,"While this movie definitely shows how heroin can destroy lives, there is, in my opinion, too much humor. I would rather recommend Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream."" Although Trainspotting is excellently directed, and I have no problems with the acting, the screenplay itself seems to make light of a very serious subject. If you've ever seen anyone suffer the rigors of drug addiction, you know that it can be a hideous thing, and there is just too much comic relief in this film. Maybe I have a sick sense of humor, but I was laughing for almost a quarter of the film, which is way too much for this genre. I have only watched ""Requiem for a Dream"" 3 or 4 times, and I don't know if I really want to ever watch it again. That's not because it's a bad movie, but it just left that strong of an impression on me. So, if you really want to see how much heroin, coke, and speed can royally f**ck up your life, buy ""Requiem for a Dream"" instead. It may not be pleasant, but sometimes the truth hurts, and I feel as though Trainspotting just candy coats the truth with an idealized picture of what addiction is like.",1269648000,,1118,4.354066985645933

844599,4,6304297912,"Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a film that has left me perplexed ever since the first time I viewed it as a teenager nearly a decade ago. I remember, as I finished the film, thoroughly hating it. There was something about its subject matter and characters that I immediately found off putting. It wasn't until my third or fourth viewing of the picture that I really understood what Boyle was going for.

It's supposed to be off putting and the characters are supposed to be unlikable. The film shows just how much of an impact heroin can have on a young individual's life. It destroys it to the point where heroin because the only that the really matters. For these young drug addicts, the only thing that gets them through the day is the anticipation of the next hit. By using over-the-top visuals (the sequence with the dead infant in the crib is one that I won't be able to shake for sometime) and a rapid MTV music video style editing, Boyle makes the film visually fascinating while showing the truth behind the life of the average drug addict.

If I have a problem with the film it's that it really doesn't go far enough. Less quick cutting and hyper stylized editing and more human characters would have made the film deeper and more palatable. But, maybe that wasn't what Boyle was going for. With his use of editing, he shows just how much can be lost when one is stuck in the sad world of drug addiction. That, in and of itself, makes the film something special. The film is gritty and dark, both qualities that are rarely seen in Hollywood movies today. I still think the ending doesn't work as well as it should as it feels a bit too upbeat but that's a minor quibble of an otherwise fine film.",1262131200,,1706,4.464743589743589
844647,4,6304297912,"""Trainspotting""(1996) is directed by Danny Boyle (Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire). The film follows the lives of various friends who are all trapped in the world of drugs abuse. The film is hilariously conceived with the friends showing the degrees to which they are willing to go in order to support their addictions. Hallucinations abound with Mark (Ewan McGregor) diving into toilets for his stash, or seeing babies crawling on ceilings. Even though the film is generally very upbeat, and frenetic, there is always lurking around the corner the dark side of these individuals' lives.

This particular blu-ray is a bit disappointing, if only because it is barebones. There are zero special features, and the film has not been remastered. Even though the blu-ray image quality is sharper than the DVD there really isn't a big improvement over the DVD version in this case.",1261526400,6,872,5.140845070422535

844649,5,6304297912,"There are truly a lot of films about drug abuse, but there are a select few that shed light on the brutality of it.  I've reviewed films such as `Requiem for a Dream' and `Panic at Needle Park', two films that show the drastic measures some will go in destroying themselves for a fix; and it's within those films that the haunting realities of drug addiction becomes so real to the audience.  `Trainspotting' is similar in its honesty, yet it differs in its direction.  Some have been put off from the way that `Trainspotting' portrays drug abuse, but in my personal opinion the slight comedic edge the film possesses adds yet another layer of honesty to the film.

Boyle's masterpiece shows the light and the dark side of addiction.

The film centers around a group of friends who area all heavy into heroin.  They all at times strive for a better existence but are more often than not taken over by their carnal desires.  The film simply observes their conduct and exposes the reasons they stay hooked as well as the reasons they wish they weren't.

What is so devastating about `Trainspotting' is that it nearly blindsides you with its shocking moments of truth.  This technique works very well, for it generates in us pure and genuine outbursts of emotion.  Some have mentioned a certain scene involving an infant; a scene so raw and heart-stopping that I was literally in tears.  These are the moments that benefit from the films wicked mixture of drama and humor, for it makes the impact of these scenes even more devastating.  We are friends with these people (even though we really shouldn't be) and so to watch them crumble under the weight of their disease is heartbreaking.

The film is propelled by a commanding performance by Ewan McGregor.  He captures every ounce of Renton's immaturity as well as his worldly knowledge and strive for betterment.  He is engaging, entertaining, likable and relatable.  He's aided by a very strong cast that includes Robert Carlyle and it is here that we are introduced to the luminous Kelly Macdonald (of `No Country for Old Men' fame).  Macdonald is one of my favorites here, for her slick mix of sensuality and impish dominance is pure gold.  I just loved watching her.

Danny Boyle's magical talents are on full display here.  I know he is a household name now thanks to his Oscar winning film `Slumdog Millionaire', but honestly he is in top form in his earlier work (see also his ravenous work on '28 Days Later').  I've always been a fan of his, and this is probably his best work.  Visually he is captivating, but he juggles both the witty and the ominous with such strength.  It's a flawless culmination of the two.

This film is as shocking as it is engrossing; as repulsive as it is engaging.  There are few films that are daring enough to be this honest.",1236729600,3,2813,4.66869918699187

844721,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is far varied from the usual drug movies that preceded it.  Along with Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting was a shift from the casual use of drugs sans the consequences to a far darker tale.  While Requiem for a Dream was clearly an anti addiction tale, Trainspotting uses heroin as catalyst.  It isn't an anti drug movie per se.  Rather, it's a story of a group of friends who happen to use drugs.

The film lifts its material from the book of the same name.  While it's a very different take, excising a lot of the book's material, the spirit is the same.  Notably, it is accurate juxtaposition of Irvine Welsh's stream of consciousness writing, using Renton as the chief protagonist.  While much of the film deals with Renton's heroin usage, we go along with Renton as he hangs out with Sick Boy, readies Spud for a job interview, shoplifts, goes clubbing, gets a job, etc. When he's not interacting with his mates, he's thinking about them.

The film doesn't take a moral stance on drugs, but does show how it is the thing that brings Renton and his mates together and at the same time ruins their friendship.  But it's a combination of factors.  The film has a subtle repeated phrase where Renton or one of the others mutters about another that ""he's a mate,"" sticking by each other in spite of it all.  The film makes one ask, what will be the straw that breaks the camel's back?

Aside from a brilliant screenplay, the film boasts one of the best ensemble casts.  While known for making Ewan MacGregor a recognizeable face, it also features the talented Johnny Lee Miller as the James Bond obsessed Sick Boy as well as the infallable Robert Carlyle as the sadistic Begbie.  The combination of music and very inspired shots, including the now infamous scene where Renton overdoses, makes the film alone worth watching.

The DVD features the international cut, without the annoying dubbing of the first US release and a few seconds of film restored.  It also ports over the Criterion laserdisc extras, including a wonderful commentary featuring Ewan, Danny Boyle, and John Hodge.  In addition, there's some newly included production vignettes and, to me what is still the best feature, a number of deleted scenes - which further portray the destruction of the people in Renton's life, including a legless Swanney and a much colder cynical Sick Boy.

844797,5,6304297912,"There are plenty of movies that show the traditional comming of age tale, but nothing compares to the comical, extreme and sometimes painfully true film that is 'Trainspotting'. Trainspotting is the story of five screwed up pals looked upon as the dirt and rejected in their Scottish upbrining. Each over their heads in their own screwed up addictions. Everything from substance abuse, to theivery, to petefilia, these guys have dug their own graves so deep it would be a miricle to get out of it. Yet the main character Mark Renton played by the brilliant Ewen McGreggor is the one that is forced to change his ways against his own will. Through loving parants and a high school student he accidentally had relations with, Mark manages to begin enjoying life. Even when temptation arrives again in the form of his mates he still manages to free himself eventhough he admits to being a bad person he knows he is on the right track with our without the people that made a major impression on his life.

This story is one of the most relatable ones I have seen in all the movies I have seen that tell this story. In life we all grow up with a small circle of friends. These are the people who let into the deepest darkest corners of our souls. Even if they may the most brilliant of people, or low lives, from those who are pure to those that are pure evil we kept them close just because they trusted and understood who we were. Yet a time comes in all our lives where we must face the real world put aside the childish games and sacrifce our time to jobs and keep our lives in line with modern society. It is up to those same friends who we still hold dear to our hearts or just hate to join or be left behind in the gutter to rot.

844799,4,6304297912,"Bearing that in mind, I think Trainspotting is quite well done. The problem is there's so many things surrounding the drug issue I just don't know what to think of the film. Is Trainspotting a bit too glossy, too movie-like? In some ways it is... the characters are funny, and larger than life, easily able to get through 90% of their troubles even when these things could be profound issues in real life. There's barely a trace of existential despair. For the most part these anti-heroes are just self indulgent party guys, that create their own gritty, destructive life. You don't get the sense of any of them being alienated from families or social support. If they're supposed to be the genuine ghettoized, they don't come across as it other than behavioral problems they choose to have.

However, if you get past the fact that making a movie about drugs is hard as hell because you'll either come across as too cautionary or too glamorous, then Trainspotting is very witty, slick movie. In the end it doesn't make any final calls about drugs or morality, which is how it does manage to stay somewhat out of the realm of criticism, but at the same time it's slightly disappointing. Don't we watch movies to see what they can reveal about the center of human behavior? If that's the case, although Trainspotting is very amusing, it has no answers.",1177718400,,1350,4.69620253164557
844800,4,6304297912,"Mainly, this is the story of Renton, a heroin addict, and his friends Tommy, Spud, Sick Boy, and Begbie.  Renton tries more than once to rid himself of the white horse on his back, but finds that being sucked back in is easier than fighting the horse.

This is a movie about people and personalities, not one particular event, though several of these everyday occurrences will stand out in your mind forever - Like the world's filthiest toilet that Renton is forced to use, and his toilet daydream that follows it.  There's an unforgettable scat scene with morning sheets that will be sure to turn your stomach.

Warning:  There is a dead baby scene in this movie that will turn most stomachs and perhaps make you hate every heroin addict that ever lived.  Though nothing is ever said about it, the insinuation is that the baby died from neglect.  Before even reporting it, the mother needs a ""hit"" to calm her down.

Set to a great soundtrack and filled with witty dialogue (although absolutely filled with flagrant curses) and narrative, 'Trainspotting' highlights not just the differences between ""Us And Them"" but the differences between the addicts themselves.  The most violent of the addicts, Begbie, never touches heroin and considers it to be filth while swilling alcohol and stabbing people.  Spud is simply confused all the time, while Tommy manages to steer clear of the horse until his girlfriend dumps him.

If you're a fan of the addiction movie, then this is a must-see.  If you can't handle horrific scenes, such as the dead baby scene, then perhaps pass on this.  Because of its languid, what-happens-everyday approach is far from an active script, a rental first might be the best approach to viewing this movie before buying.

844802,5,6304297912,"Calling ""Trainspotting"" the funniest film ever made about heroin addiction doesn't begin to do it justice - but it is. There's a strain of dark humor that runs through this adaptation of the Irvine Welsh novel which is inescapable - from clever little asides like ""We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit"" to hallucinations of AIDS-based game shows to Spud's speed-freaked job interview (not to mention Irvine Welsh's own cameo as a hopelessly out-of-his-depth dealer).

""Trainspotting"" is a movie based on a book about the complexities of heroin addiction in 1990s Edinburgh, but neither the book or the film is any sort of morality play. We get to see heroin addicts in all stages of their habit (up to and including death), but the filmmakers are smart enough not to impose outside values on their actions, letting the characters speak for themselves. The result is frequently grotesque, sometimes surreal, occasionally enlightening- and as mentioned before, very often funny as hell, and all of it delivered in thick Edinburgh accents and patois.

The real strength of the film, though, is in the ensemble casting and the excellent performances this draws out of Ewan McGregor as Renton, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, and the very much underrated Ewen Bremner (was ""Alien vs. Predator /really/ the best gig he could get after this?) as the hopeless Spud. Robert Carlyle delights in what has proven to be an unusual turn for him as the completely mental Begbie- but comparing this role to the rest of his work just makes it more fun.",1165622400,4,1564,4.89811320754717
844876,5,6304297912,"Plenty of reviews have described this amazing movie. I'd just like to add a note on the meaning of the title.  Most people have ignored it - one reviewer thought it was a reference to the frequency of shooting up. As an (ex) Brit, who grew up in Scotland, when I saw it, some time ago, I just automatically assumed something quite different.

*** BUT - see the reader's comment below! An informative correction to the ideas that follow! ***
First - trainspotting is an actual hobby in Britain. Remember that this is a small country with a dense and active rail network. Lots of people are really, really interested in trains, but trainspotting is kind of the very lowest-grade interest.  Trainspotters stand around stations, or major rail junctions, or marshalling yards, and just collect train facts - usually engine numbers, sometimes appearances of some particular kind of rolling stock. That is all they do - make lists!  (Or sometimes trade number lists with other spotters, or exult in the size of their list).  So the image of a trainspotter is a low-energy person, very conventional in outlook, probably standing for hours in the rain in a shabby raincoat...one who has pretty much given up on ever doing anything exciting and who absolutely needs to get a life!  Collecting train numbers is basically pure, time-consuming obsession. Collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks, or any of the thousand other odd things people collect, sometimes has another dimension - artistic interest, investment, etc - train numbers lead nowhere.

So to me the title ""Trainspotting"" was a sardonic reminder of the monotonous, meaningless ""normal"" life that the guys were rebelling against and trying to escape from - unwisely, but desperately - in their drug usage. It was the background against which the vivid and certainly scary picture was painted.

Hope this was helpful. Would be interesting to hear from anyone associated with the movie if that's right - as I say, it was just the natural., automatic interpretation for me.

PS - after reading many, many reviews - why is it that so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell the words definite and definitely? Many keep thinking there's an A in there somewhere...one even wrote ""defiantly"" which gave an interesting and unintended twist, and of course passed spell-check...Oh well.",1163203200,13,2341,5.012886597938144
844877,5,6304297912,"Being Scottish, maybe I'm biased but this is a brilliant, laugh out loud funny , film. I looked at its reviews on the US Amazon site just to see what the Americans made of it - especially the accents. They're really not that ""thick"" as many reviewers state - I think even viewers from England understood them.

Also, Trainspotting is intentionally funny; our sense of humour is not the same as yours though. Don't even think of reading the book if you found the accents unintelligible - its full of colloquial Scots (not Scotch - thats the drink).Theres also many even more gruesome scenes in the book than in the film.",1161129600,7,619,4.576576576576577

844879,5,6304297912,"Its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly, but that didn't stop Trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties, and having just watched it this morning I can safely state that it holds up well to this day.  While I haven't read the Irvine Welsh novel on which this movie is based, I have read some of his other work, and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling style-rapid-fire, filled with bawdy set pieces, characters living on the edge of acceptable society, and lots and lots of swears.  It's also the kind of violent, genre-defying, and pop culture reference-laden movie, complete with way-cool soundtrack, that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade.  For my money at least, this movie is a much more entertaining and convincing look at the world of heroin users than the interesting, but annoyingly depressing and pedantic, Requiem for a Dream, which came out a few years later to almost hyperbolic praise.  Trainspotting is a blunt, unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine, delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes.  It doesn't shrink from depicting the damage caused by heroin addiction, but it doesn't downplay all the fun of it either, which is what lends it so much of its gritty believability.

Trainspotting also marked the arrival on the international scene of director Danny Boyle, whose manic visual style would later serve him well on the slightly-less-brilliant 28 Days Later.  Perhaps most impressively, it manages to contain one of my all-time top ten movie lines (""Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?""), my favorite nickname ever, fictional or otherwise (""We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit""-brilliant), and more ""Oh my God, did I just see that?"" images than you'll find in fifty Hollywood blockbusters.  In Boyle's hands the crazy imagery practically flies off the screen, be it human waste flying from a sheet across a room, the movie's protagonist climbing into Scotland's filthiest toilet to retrieve something he lost, or the hallucinatory, nightmarish haze of a cold-turkey withdrawal.  The unrestrained depictions of sex, nudity, violence, drug use, and bodily functions make this a movie not to be viewed by the squeamish, but they perfectly suit its unflinching examination of the sordid goings-on in one country's drug-laden urban culture.

The action is filtered through the point of view of the movie's narrator, Mark Renton, a cynical but insightful twentysomething travelling through a nihilistic culture of nightclubs and drug dens without many concerns beyond getting his next fix because, well, all other concerns seem petty and inconsequential by comparison.  Although I don't use drugs (well, the ones arbitrarily declared illegal anyway), it's not exactly hard to understand Renton's reasons-in a world as numbing as the one that surrounds him, the ephemeral rush of a heroin high is more tangible and true than most of what people use to distract themselves from their unfulfilling lives.  Really, that's what the movie's about-the relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness.  Renton's not that bad a guy; he mostly just wants to score some drugs and sex and listen to some Iggy Pop, and if his lifestyle causes anyone else (i.e., his parents) to suffer, well, that's just an unfortunate byproduct.  Besides, it's not like he's missing that much: the Scotland of Trainspotting is a rather depressing land of dingy, Detroit-esque post-industrial decay, and even the natural beauty of the local highlands isn't enough to overcome the cynicism that's overtaken Renton and most of his friends.  Viewed against this backdrop, it's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it.

Although Ewan MacGregor plays Renton in career-making fashion (too bad he spent all that time on those mediocre Star Wars prequels), Robert Carlyle delivers the most immediately enjoyable performance as the menacing Begbie, an unhinged, beer-swilling psychopath who looks at heroin users with contempt but has no problem cutting a swath of destruction through any bar where someone crosses him, intentionally or not.  Even though (or perhaps because) he's so violent and unpredictable, Begbie gives the movie a sort of bizarre comic relief through the sheer force of his twisted personality alone.  Even though I wouldn't get within fifty feet of the guy, I couldn't help but enjoy watching him, especially with Carlyle turning in such a likably maniacal performance.

Besides, in addition to what I've written above, how can you not like a movie that features a shot of a dead baby crawling along a ceiling and rotating its head 180 degrees?  If that doesn't scream fun for the whole family, I don't know what does.",1154217600,30,4897,5.1358490566037736
844880,4,6304297912,"The Danny Boyle directed ""Trainspotting"" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers.  While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.  Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included ""Full Monty"" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high.

Congregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high.  As a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix.

McGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies.  Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories.  In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories.  He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them.

McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor.  His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life.

McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal.  They manage to complete the deal for 16,000 pounds which McGregor decides to steal.  He intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew.  Fat chance.",1152489600,,1548,5.14

844882,5,6304297912,"There are few movies which warrant a 5 star rating from me. If I could give Trainspotting 10 stars I would.

For me, a movie has to stay with you long after the credits roll. It has to make you think and feel. It has to subject you to a roller coaster ride of emotions. Trainspotting delivers the goods.

So many have described the movie and what it's about, I am not going to do that. Suffice it to say that the movie will make you cry, piss-your-pants laugh, think, cheer wildly and discuss it with your friends years after you first saw it. I remember having the nagging feeling that I needed to take a shower after seeing it. THAT, my friends, is the sign of a GREAT movie.

Another great feature of Trainspotting is the soundtrack. It features many of my favorites, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, etc. The soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Everytime I hear Lust For Life by Iggy Pop now, I automatically think of Trainspotting. THAT is another sign of a great movie.

844935,3,6304297912,"The screenwriter did a helluva job. A tough job. He managed to tackle a book that is a gem, but disjointed, disconnected, no real climax/anti-climax/without all the stuff you heard in English class. No saying what comes next, both in the movie and the book. That's what got the audiences' veins pumping.. no pun intended.

The ""thing"" about the movie is the liberty it takes, the quality of it, but the point it entirely misses. Admission. You cannot recreate this book. It is a series of stories and people just will not respond to the fact that yes the heroes or antiheroes of the movie are much more than flawed or unflawed. That would be too complicated because the plot is too complicated as is, and they have to strain to get the brogue. (I suggest keeping the book by the can-- a good primer).

But these characters are walking around in a daze. That's the book. They tell their stories, recount episodes, but in reality, hey, no one knows what to do next except hit the pub, the needle, or the first guy you see.

The movie makes Renton and heroin the focus while we get different perspectives--different heroes--in the book. But Trainspotting isn't about just heroin and Rents is a flawed character as are his mates. He is a guy who would really f you over and feel bad about it but still do it. That's reality. That's one of the major lessons that we already know from the book that are glossed over in the movie until the end. Too much Hollywood in the movie?

As I write this I think of how much I thought how cool and stylish the movie was-- and it really is-- and how well acted it was and is. And then how superior the book really is. But all in all, the book shows that addiction brings to the forefront a crisis of morality that is not addressed in the movie. It is simply not addressed, despite the fab ending, and this is a sin.

Addiction is all-encompassing. It becomes the focus of their lives but they have to build lives around it or die. The movie doesn't show it. It's glamor and horror but not the everyday.

All and all, it's a great movie, it's just not the book. I hate writing that but I'll write it again- it's a great movie, it's just not the book.",1143158400,3,2181,4.346437346437346

The cast has this amazing chemistry and each actor really becomes their character. The story is so much more than hopeless drug addicts. It tells the stories of friends lost in time, so stuck in their comfort zone that venturing out of it causes complete chaos. This group is trying so desparately to hold on to what was, but eventually time has to catch up and force them to either change or die trying to resist. Everything in this movie stands out: the pain, the misery, the happiness, the comedy, the confusion, fear etc. The opening lines are classic: ""I chose not to choose life...I chose something different."" The other thing about this film is the use of music to shift time. There's none of those subtitles saying ""three years later"" or ""1979"". What the film uses instead is a brilliant soundtrack in which each track helps shift the movie to new year or a new decade. I have yet to read the book, but if books are better than films that I'm sure to be impressed.

844937,5,6304297912,"The reason I originally wanted to see the film was when I was in London, there was a stage production of the book which got rave reviews.  I did not get a chance to see it but there was a lot of press about Trainspotting mania in the UK.  When the film came out I wanted to see it but found out it was about drugs and became leery of it.  Since it got great reviews, I went and saw it and was surprised.  It was my favorite film of the year!

The film deals with four friends that are caught up in the Scottish drug culture.  The hero of the film is Renton (Ewan McGregor).  His best friends are Sick boy, Begbie, Tommy and Spud.  All but Tommy are heroine addicts.  Renton decides to go cold turkey.  But before cold turkey, one last hit.  (This leads to one of the most disgusting yet intriguing fantasy sequences.)  Renton finds it hard to stay clean and slips.  He gets caught stealing and is forced to enter rehab.  Afterwards, he gets a reality check from his underage girlfriend.  He realizes that he cannot live this life forever.

Renton decides he needs to break away from his crew and moves to London for a fresh start.  But Begbie shows up then Sick Boy.  This is hampering his sobriety and kicks them out.  But the boys have to return home for a mate's funeral and there luck into a big score.  They return to London to sell their score.

I generally hate films that are narrated but it works here.  Even more, I hate movies that in any way glamorize drugs but this really doesn't, even the fantasy sequences are not glamorous.  This is just a great look at the subculture.

This is one of director's Danny Boyle's first films and he creates near perfection.  The only actor with any true film background is Robert ""The Full Monty"" Carlisle but everyone is universally great.  Ewan McGregor will not become a star until later but this shows his ability.

It is pobably the film I reach for most often when I put a dvd in. If you like films that explore the seedy underbelly of society than you will love this. It is loaded with disturbing drugged out dispair. However it is also one of the funniest films I have ever seen.

This film also has a very serious nature to it as well. Rentons attempts to ween himself from smack will make anybody think twice about sliding that syringe int your veins. That being said this is not just your usual ""drugs are evil"" movie. Trainspotting also holds no bars about the reason people do drugs.  ""Take the best orgasm youve ever had and multiply it by a thousand and your still nowhere near it""-Renton. That pretty much explains it all.

844939,5,6304297912,"I had taken notice of ""Trainspotting"" in the ""NY Times Best 1000 Movies"".  I got an idea that it was a bit rough from what I'd seen of reviews.  I have a personal bias against movies that go out of their way to be graphic and/or obscene.  Thus I was not sure how I would react to what I thought I would see.  I will say that ""Trainspotting"" is not a movie for everyone, it should be respected for its' ""R"" rating, and it is one heck of a movie.  ""Trainspotting"" will shock you with its' violence, its' view of a dead end society, the close-up examination of heroin addiction, and some of the grossest scenes I've ever seen in a movie of this quality.  Nonetheless, the movie is not guilty of any excesses except in the subject matter itself.

Not long ago, I had the pleasure to watch ""The Full Monty"" which has a greater renown than ""Trainspotting"" and deals as well with the subject of the down and out in urban Great Britain.  That movie let us have fun while coming to understand a stagnant society that offered little hope of change to its' citizens.  I will admit that, although I rarely laugh out loud when I'm watching a movie by myself, there is one grossly hilarious scene in ""Trainspotting"" that had me laughing boisterously out loud.  Other than that, humor is not a part of this film.  It deals with an alternate solution to hopelessness; narcotic addiction.  It portrays addiction in a very negative manner while dealing with its' victims in a very humanely manner.  These people may scare us, repulse us and, possibly, disgust us but we generally are pulling for them to find a way out.

I caught myself, midway through the movie, thinking that ""Trainspotting"" should be required viewing for anyone contemplating using heroin or any addictive drugs.  It paints a bleak picture and does so with the excesses that it takes.  There is a brilliantly disgusting scene in the worst of all possible toilets in the back of some dive.  It may turn your stomach but what you see happening there says so clearly the depravity an addict will sink to.  There are scenes that give an excellent visual concept to the withdrawals that an addict must go through to get clean again.  There are slaps of reality that let us know that there is never any complete escape from the real world.  As I saw scene after scene that stung my senses and sensitivity, I could not help but marvel at the ability of the writer and director; Irving Welsh and Danny Boyle.  Unlike ""Naked Lunch"", a movie that disgusted me for no apparent reason, ""Trainspotting"" tells a story that could only be understood this well by the approach that Welsh and Boyle took.

""Trainspotting"" is not just a negative view of the underground world of the addict; it takes its' shots at polite society as well.  The beginning and the end of the movie involve a diatribe about all that is irrelevant in our well-ordered lives.  We are prepared to question our values in what we see yet, for me, the recap at the end made my life seem all the more relevant despite the film's apparent intent.  This was definitely one alternative lifestyle that offered no appeal.",1139011200,,3121,4.560143626570915

""When Trainspotting was released in 1996, it took the world by storm and caused a sensation not only in its homeland of England, but in the United States as well.""

Its 'homeland' was Scotland, not England. Films go on national release over here to all the countries in Britain which are Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England.

The film itself is brilliant, an accurate portrayal of heroin addicts in Edinburgh (they are not Glaswegian as another reviewer has said) and is well worth owning, the book is even better.

This movie succeeds as a quirky, humorous look at disenchatment in modern society.  Some people might look at the characters as a bunch of junkies or screw ups, but they'd miss the point.  The main character, Mark Renton, choose heroin because he doesn't know what else to do.  Renton falls into the growing group of people who grow up and can't get excited about going to school and working for the next 40 years in a dead end job with nothing to show for it in the end except material goods and a 401K.

The main character is played by Ewan McGregor, and he gives a fine performance.  The supporting actors are also good.  Perhaps my favorite part of the movie is the direction, as Danny Boyle does an excellent job of depicting several dream sequences, including one where Renton goes swimming in a toilet, and another when he's trying to get clean.",1135728000,3,1129,4.5721393034825875

The thick Scottish accents, and the British slang may have been thick to cut through a decade ago, but in our world of Harry Potter, Bridget Jones and Austin Powers, if you don't know what ""football"" ""Jumper"" and ""wanker"" mean, you've been hiding under a rock.

844988,5,6304297912,"With witty voice over narration, in a sometimes incomprehensible Scottish brogue, from Ewan Macgregor as the lead protagonist Trainspotting starts of with a delightful introduction to a motley crue of misfits. When we are introduced to these characters that make up his circle of friends, Tommy, Sick Boy, Begbie and Spud all the time moving to the sounds of Iggy Pop's catchy ""Lust for life"" we know we are in for a treat. The movie is a humorous, dark, cynical, satirical look at the life of a junkie and the effects of heroin on the lives of himself and his friends.

It also comes across as a social commentary piece, juxtaposing the mundane activites of everyday society with the fixed purpose of a ""sincere and honest"" drug habit. The movie in no way condones the use of drugs but does show the kinds of motivation that initiate it. It's very postmodern in that the movie critiques the ""grandnarratives"" of modern society and shows how empty and supeficial they are, even to the extent that a drug habit is more appealing than living exposed to modern-day plastic consumerism hyper reality. The superficiality of society and the norms are starkly contrasted with the real, physical, painful, purposeful life that governs and directs someone on smack!

Apart from the postmodern themes and ideas that the movie posits, at the end of the day it's just a great piece of extraordinary filmmaking with delighful exchanges, a wonderful soundtrack and a lot of jokes about Sean Connnery!

I don't want to spoil any more of the suprise so all I can do is suggest that you go out and buy this NOW! You won't regret it, however watch it with an ""open-mind"".",1123200000,2,1653,4.7526132404181185

This film is about a man who's deep into drugs and it's all his life revolves around. It's funny to see the kinds of things he does to get himself off the addiction but always faulters. Heroin is the major drug used in this movie. Exhuberance of youth is one thing that is displayed. I have seen Requiem For A Dream and I certainly don't dig it. Trainspotting isn't as depressive and dark as RFAD.It has it's own moments. The English accent used is quite amusing and difficult to follow but you get the hang of it.

I laughed out loud 4 times and cried 0 times.

844990,5,6304297912,"""Trainspotting"", a classic movie that spawned a classic soundtrack, hit the big screen in 1996 and is based on Irvine Welsh's debut novel. Starring, among others, a pre-Jedi Ewan McGregor, Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle, the film is mostly set in Edinburgh and London. The film is narrated by Mark Renton - known to some as Rent Boy and played by McGregor. It tells the story of our 'hero' and his friends : a group of junkies and / or criminals.

As the film opens, Renton is already a heroin addict - though, as it progresses, he tries several times to get off the drug. Most of his friends are also addicts - the most notable exception is Begbie, played by Carlyle. Franco (as he is occasionally known) is an ignorant, obnoxious, violent, hard-drinking bully, who likes nothing better than being at the center of a brawl. Sick Boy - played by Miller - is as much a rival to Renton as a friend. He is also something of an expert on Sean Connery, particularly in his 007 days. (Miller's grandfather, funnily enough, played ""M"" in the Bond movies until 1979). For some reason, I found Spud (played by Ewen Bremmer) to be the most likeable character - or, at least, the one I had the most sympathy for...I'm not entirely sure why, when it was Tommy who had the worst luck of all. (Bremmer was also in the running for the part of Renton - he'd played that part on stage in Edinburgh and London). The gang's dealer is known as Mother Superior - it's not that he's particularly religious, it's more to do with the length of his habit.

The soundtrack is superb - New Order feature, while Primal Scream begged to be allowed to write a song after seeing a rough cut of the movie. I now find it hard not to think of the film's opening scene when I hear Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"", while Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" inclusion is not entirely unexpected, but thoroughly welcome.

Anyone who tells you that ""Trainspotting"" glamorises drug-taking in general, and heroin use in particular, simply can't have watched it. While there is a great deal of humor, many of the scenes and situations do not present addiction as an appealing option. Renton and his friends see a great deal of action : constipation when hooked, impressive bouts of diarrhoea when coming off the drug, the risk of catching HIV / AIDS, the sickness brought on by going cold turkey and the potentially fatal effects of too big a hit. As a result, it's not for the easily offended or the squeamish - while it's one of my favorite movies, I wouldn't recommend watching it with your grandparents !",1109808000,6,2556,4.528138528138528

Not for the faint hearted, there are some gross scenes in the movie- the public toilet scene for one.

A very dark movie, with the most accurate potrayal of junkies perhaps ever seen in a major movie, this movie is also sad, funny, and full of hope in some places, and the depths of woe in others.

You find yourself sympathasising with the main character, hoping he can overcome his addiction and move on to a better life.

Very hard genre to describe, except to say definitely black humour, with some drama, tension and action thrown in for good measure

Ewan McGregor is a very underrated actor and he's brilliant as a junkie in this film. This movie really hit me hard showing the despair of addiction. Some people survive it and some don't. This movie is a great depiction of the struggles each character goes through in their fight with addiction. Heroine was already something i would never do but after this movie it shows that its one of the most dangerous things you can mess with. Anyway I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. I enjoyed it more then any Tarantino movie I've seen and those are all excellent films.

At no time does ""Trainspotting"" glamourise the drug culture.  By the same token, at no time does it become preachy or self-righteous.  It is simply a grim look at the whole industry.

The film is bleak and dark but, from time to time, it is also funny.  Ewan McGregor as the narrator and chief character is brilliant.  So too is Robert Carlyle as the psychotic thug whose reversion to violence can be abrupt and frightening.  These two and an assorted cast of misfits create a true film masterpiece.

A plot, to the extent that it exists, concerns the ups and downs of a gang of Glaswegian no hopers.  Heroin is the only glue that holds them together.  It is also the substance that is ineluctably destroying them.  There are many downs and few high points.  Heroin is a savage mistress.  Yet, as the film ends, we see that perhaps our hero will get on the straight and narrow.  There is a glimmer of hope in a sea of distress.

The plot revolves around a young man, Mark Renton, and his quest for the true meaning of life admist his drug induced existence. He and his friends trip through life only living for the next shot of H and wondering how to get the money for it. They live in shabby, sparsely decorated flats and live on ratty mattresses and, for the most part, have no goal in life except ultimate pleasure for life. Renton however has more depth and yearning for something more and sets upon a quest to clean up his act and live like those he once denounced. Dark humor and stark realization are constantly presented during the film and thankfully the movie doesnt ever sacrifice one in favor of the other. The soundtrack is also excellent sporting both tried and true rock veterans Iggy Pop and Lou Reed(of the Velvet Underground) as well as modern industrial and techno artists like Primal Scream, New Order and Underworld.

The characters bounce from withdrawel back to depravity throughout the movie and have various bad experiences along the way.(the dead baby, the death of Tommy) None of the characters are especially likeable but somehow seem to possess their own charm.

knowing the material exists, the barebones content of the original DVD release is disappointing. fortunately, the movie is presented in its original aspect ratio, which, given the low production value of the dvd, this is a pleasant surprise.

the dvd box itself is relatively unattractive as the photo above suggests. the art work on the dvd is inconsistent with the original promotional material which begs the question why. it appears thrown together and rehashed quickly with marketing doing the art direction. main menu graphics are consistent with that on the box, and there is only *1* graphic.

the Collector's Edition is a double disc edition, and has all the aforementioned extras as well as additional material. the packaging has not been re-done and features the the graphics from this original dvd, which says something about how much the studio and its staff values this film. but to my great surprise and delight, the menus on the discs themselves are beautifully done, thematically consistent with the original promotional art work, and has a proper retrospective, relatively distant feel. given that the film's age is reaching its first decade, it feels appropriate. the extras on the Collector's Edition DVD are well worth the purchase, and this time, it actually feels like an object you'd want to possess.",1096934400,5,1509,5.151020408163265

Trainspotting centers around Renton (Ewan MacGregor-Nightwatch,Shallow Grave,Big Fish) Spud (Ewen Bremmer-Black Hawk Down,Acid House,Alien vs. Predator)Sick boy( johnny Lee miller-Dracula 2000, Mansfield Park, Regeneration)Tommy (Kevin Mckidd -bedrooms and hallways, topsy turvey,dad savage)and the amazing Robert Carlyle as Begbie(The Full Monty,The World is Not enough,Formula 51)

  Spud renton and sick boy are heroin junkies who do almost anything to get high, tommy is a weight lifter who videotapes himself and his girlfriend having sex (although Renton steals the tape, his girlfriend flips out when Tommy says he may have returned to the video store), Begbie is a psycho who beats people up for money or for being ""doss c**ts"", Begbie doesnt do drugs and neither does Tommy at first (later in the story Tommy shoots heroin with Renton, and i can't forget that (to quote the drug dealer Mother superior)Sick boy knows a lot about Sean Connery.

Trainspotting is part drama part black comedy,the funniest parts are when spud drops speed before a job interview and in a drugged up frenzy freaks the crap out of the the interviewers, and when Renton finds out the girl he slept with is a catholic school girl in high school currently.

Overall this is a really good movie it is not an anti drug movie or a pro drug movie, even to call it a drug movie is a cheap way to describe it.

And to correct another reviewer Trainspotting doesnt stand for herioin, there are people who spot trains all the time its all they do do is stand by the tracks and wait for more trains to go by them, the book and movie is called trainspotting because all the junkies do is get high and get high again and again, as Renton explains.

Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting tells the story of Renton (McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Tommy (Kevin McKidd); four Scottish heroin addicts in the wake of ""choosing life, or choosing not to choose life"". Director Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge manage to transfer what is an unfilmable book to film thanks to the off the wall hyperkinetic humor and the brilliant cast. Robert Carlyle's performance as the fight provoking, hard drinking Begbie is excellent as he goes from humerous to frightening in the snap of a finger. While Trainspotting isn't an ode to heroin, it is not a warning about the drug or drugs in general period.

As a previous reviewer stated, it's your choice.

Alienation of youth has been with us for a while, but it seems to flourish only in relatively benign societies subsidized by social programs. Even in capitalist America, heroin is a favorite in the Urban Pockets of Social Welfare. Ewan McGregor is a fine looking young man and he has a choice,live or stick a needle. He chooses the needle. Special effects stretch the addicts bodies like rubber and there are hallucinations of a doomed baby, a fat baby for a heroin mother. Well it reminded me of those Acid Trip, movies from the 60s.

Audiences couldn't get enough of this gritty, funny tale of Scottish heroin addicts. The Criterion Collection originally released an extras-packed laserdisc. Miramax subsequently released a bare bones edition on DVD and have now, finally, gone back to the well with a new ""Definitive Version.""
The first disc features an audio commentary that first appeared on the Criterion laserdisc with actor Ewan McGregor, director Danny Boyle, screenwriter John Hodge and producer Andrew Macdonald. This is a very informative track with excellent insights by everyone as one would expect from Criterion.
There are also nine deleted scenes with optional commentary from the Criterion laserdisc. Most of it is extra footage that unnecessarily explained things and provided more information than needed.
The second disc contains the bulk of the extra material. ""Retrospective"" examines various aspects of the film with interviews done at the time of production and brand new ones conducted last year with Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald.
""Behind the Needle"" shows a scene where Renton shoots up from three different angles with video commentary from Danny Boyle.
There is also vintage footage from the movie's screening at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. A camera crew interviews Martin Landau, Oasis' Noel Gallagher, Blur's Damon Albarn and Ewan McGregor as they exit the screening and offer their impressions of what they saw. Nothing too substantial here but it is a nice snapshot of the times.
There is also a teaser and theatrical trailers.
""The Making of Trainspotting"" featurette was done at the time of the production. It is pretty standard electronic press kit material but still well made.
There are biographies of the cast and crew.
And finally, a gallery of production Polaroids mainly of extras from the movie with some cast included as well.
Trainspotting has aged surprisingly well considering it was one of those zeitgeist-defining movies. It also set the tone and style of later British exports like Snatch.

Yet, the film is not a deadbeat documentary. With its  tongue firmly planted in one cheek, it employs glorious wit and a razor sharp narrative to drive home other points. For instance, ironically, the movie's most pathologically twisted character is not a substance abuser but an alcoholic who never touches drugs.
The thick Scottish accent lends that mildly comic cadence to the affair, and this is where the subtitles come in handy. It takes a while to get used to, but when you do, you realize that the script is topnotch.
Not to mention, the uncannily perfect compilation of popular music from Iggy Pop to Blur to Underworld. Sumptuous!

845194,5,6304297912,"A little background information regarding this DVD edition:  When the ""Trainspotting"" movie first came to video back in the '90's we were tantalized on this side of the Atlantic Ocean by an alternate version of the video known (informally) as ""the green version"".  Essentially it was the same movie, but the video itself included additional footage in the form of deleted scenes and interview footage with the director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew Macdonald.  We could get ""unofficial"" copies of ""the green version"" in the 'States, but the tape quality was always iffy at best.
Fast forward a few years later to the advent of DVD technology and the ability of film and video distributors to release not only movies on a digital disc, but also multiple layers of special features designed to add to the enjoyment of the movie and add versatility to the disc itself; movie fans get more out of owning their favorite (sorry, favourite) films.
Except for ""Trainspotting"", which was released initially in a very ""bare bones"" package, even though most fans of the movie KNEW there was a lot more footage available that would make for a more interesting presentation.  Not even so much as a theatrical trailer was included, but it was a great movie so we still bought it.
Fast-forward to today:  Canadian movie buffs HAVE AT LAST been given a respectable presentation of ""Trainspotting"", including the documentary footage with deleted scenes and a glossary of terms included on the DVD insert (similar to that found at the back of the Irvine Welsh novel) assisting the Scottishly impaired with the terminology found within the movie (the dialect itself is another matter, but of course the English subtitles overcome any defficiencies with the dialect that the VHS tape may have fostered).
Sadly, the release of ""Trainspotting:  The Definitive Edition"" in the United Kingdom earlier this year confirms that as good as this ""Widescreen Collector's Edition"" is, it could still be even better (and may be so in the future).  Of course, the region coding for UK-based DVD's prevents them from being played on this side of the pond, so this version represents the best edition that we will see for at least another few years.
And because US-based DVD players utilize the same Region 1 format as those from Canada, the discriminating US shopper is going to make it a point to choose this Canadian edition over the plain old boring Miramax/Buena Vista Home Entertainment version we've had to make do with over the last several years.",1070150400,,2522,4.947990543735225

845198,5,6304297912,"i loved this film since the day it arrived in limited screen release back in 1996. i had never read an Irvine Welsh novel and wasn't quite sure what to expect. The only sense of British humor (including the great emerald isles, scotland and wales)i had seen in film before trainspotting is probably a fish called wanda. of course these two films are worlds apart from one another and an entirely different brand of comedy. the parts you are supposed to laugh at have you in gutwrenching hysterics and the parts intended to be a little more gruesome you're practically having to turn your head from the tv screen.
the characters are beautifully illustrated and are very true to the characters presented in Welsh's novel. Renton (played by Ewan McGregor when he was still wet behind the ears) is the narrator and main character. he is surrounded by friends who share the same ambition as him, looking for their next shot of heroin. the things they find themselves doing are inconceiveable to the sober mind.the emphasis is the world that heroin creates and most certainly stops itself from glamorizing its use. the setting is a very dismal and gloomy Edinburgh, Scotland which is ideal for the storyline.
the thing most intriguing about the film is how you find each of the characters to be likeable and endearing in their own unique way. the world of ""junkie music"" is woven ingeniously into the film which clearly makes the two soundtracks an ideal accompaniment to the film. all of the performances are memorable and it created a new genre of filmmaking to come out of Great Britain. Visceral, hard edged, truthful and gritty are the words that will lean heavy on you once you've seen this film. Supposedly, Welsh is in talks currently to make a film out of the novel Ecstacy and should be out sometime next year. more scenes of pharmaceutical use and sheer pandemonium. Cant wait!",1068422400,,1882,4.758409785932722
845199,5,6304297912,"This is a movie about heroin addicts. So why anyone shocked that the movie is dark gritty and shockingis beyond me. This story is told by Mark Renton aka Renton. He and his friends are hopless and addicted to heroin and it isn't pretty. It's real. Mark's life is ruled by drugs. This movie dosen't try to make drugs seem cool or nice. It shows what hitting up can really do, what it really does. I don't think (I hope) that anyone saw this and said. ""Geezs I sure wish I had their life."" This movie dosen't tell you drugs are bad.  It dosen't have to. I mean would you want to be Marcus or any of this friends? I liked that this move covred both sides. It wasn't just about drugs it was about life. How we choose to spend it. How the actions we take shape it.  to live it. Listen to Renton's speech at the opening. I mean did  the people who didn't use have any better of a life? You also got the feeling they were telling you drugs weren't the only thing you can abuse. If you think this movie is about glorifying drugs you've missed the whole plot. If anything this movie is anti drugs. And I love the way they didn't come out in a  after-school-specail-way to do it  The sceen with the dead baby, the toxoplasmosis and the taxi cab sceen should all stick vividly in your mind as reason not to ever want to go anywhere near smack.

The movie is very realistic, it shows the highs and lows of using heroin, the negatives certainly out wegh the pluses, and i would consider it a very anti-drug movie. Because unless you are a moron and think that the stuff that happened to him, his friend, and friends g/f was good. then you should probably go do it and die. Sorry for being so harsh but its true, you'd have to be really dumb to watch this movie and think its pro-drug use. Although they do use alot of drugs in the movie, thats really not what its about. Well it is, but it isn't; its basically just about a group of friends, 3 of which happen to do heroin. And the others 2 aren't that great of being friends in the first place. The good friend in the movie, shouldn't of done what he did. Lots of lessons to be learnt from this movie.
The comdey in this movie is something else, omg. It is so hilarious at times, i laughed so hard. That one part, with spud is the best, omg i laughed so many times, i still laugh whenever i see it. And the part while he's at the interview, hilarious.",1065830400,,1133,4.154545454545454
845201,5,6304297912,"I'd like to begin this review with my pre-viewing expectations - - ZILCH!  I had never heard of this movie, had not viewed the trailer or read the box, I just sat down on my sofa as my husband pressed ""play"" on the remote and jumped right in with both feet.  The first few minutes made me squirm, I was thinking ""oh no, a movie glorifying drugs, with lots of F-words and thick accents"", but the narration of the main character, Mark Renton, was intellectually stimulating, so I listened more closely and allowed myself to become immersed in the story.  The characters in this story are ugly, heroin-addicted losers, but they are portrayed as very real people - - yes, they are bad, but they are not evil.  Their lives are extremely grim and repugnant.  I've always wondered how people addicted to heroin can live their lives thinking they are living normally, and the addiction is so powerful it renders them powerless to live any other way, but then I realized almost anything can be considered an addiction - - we all wrestle with something, be it our weight, our ethics, our punctuality, etc..  Moments when we convince ourselves it will be the last time, until the next time.
The film makes some interesting comparisons between a ""normal"" life, and the twisted lives of these characters.  You notice small hypocrisies, such as the friend in the pub railing against drug use, while he obviously has an alcohol and an anger-management problem.  This film also addresses the issues of loyalty, culture, politics - - with some scathing commentary on consumerism and capitalism - - and some digs at the ""Just Say No"" and ""Choose Life"" rallying cries.  I particularly liked the ending - - there were no sweeping revelations for the characters, they remained true to their weaknesses, true to their characters.
There are plenty of sad, sick moments, and there are some very funny moments, even through the darkness, and the wit of each character is fantastic.  Some of the most imaginative sequences I enjoyed immensely, but felt as though they could've done without the extremism and still kept a good flowing story.  Still, they certainly made a strong point in the scene involving the most disgusting toilet in Scotland.  As for the dialogue, I am going to have to watch it again, just to make sure I caught it all.  My husband and I finally admitted we weren't understanding the dialogue as fully as we would've liked, so we switched to the ""hearing-impaired"" sub-titles about 30 minutes into the film.  The Scottish accents are the thickest!
The acting is terrific, across the board.  I was shocked - - just flabbergasted! - - as the film ended and I saw Ewan McGregor was Mark Renton!  He looked so gaunt and ill, not the charming and handsome Ewan McGregor of 'Moulin Rouge'!
Definitely not a movie for the kids, 'Trainspotting' is a film everyone should see once, even if the topic is unsettling.  Plus, I give it extra stars for utilizing my favorite descriptive noun - - ""wanker"".  I also appreciated the integration of Iggy Pop's song ""Lust for Life"", knowing that it was written after Iggy had kicked his heroin habit and had a newfound lust for life.  I'm just glad to hear that song used anywhere other than car commercials!",1063670400,171,3235,4.734402852049911
845202,5,6304297912,"I was first drawn to this movie because of Ewan McGregor, so I didn't know that much about the storyline, just that it had to do with heroin addiction. When I finally saw the movie, I was really amazed at how well the actors protrayed the addicts. The plot focuses around a group of friends living in Europe (I think Scotland) who are heroin addicts. Ewan plays the main character, Renton. Her narrates throughout the movie. The movie just follows the paths of all these characters through their addictions and the consequences of them. The DVD box says they plan a big heist, but it's really near the end of the movie when they plan to sell a whole of heroin for money, that's the big ""heist."" This movie was a little depressing, so if you don't like being a little depressed, then don't watch it. But all and all, I recomend this movie to anyone!",1059696000,,848,4.4423076923076925
845262,4,6304297912,"In 1996, ""Trainspotting"" took the world by surprise; it was a film that was compared to the classic Stanley Kubrick's film ""A Clockwork Orange"", due to it's kinetic energy, and fatalistic insight. This film is not a popcorn movie; it's a movie that requires patience and whether you like it or not, it will provoke you different emotions and thoughts.
""Trainspotting"" tells the story of Renton and his buddies Spud, Sick Boy and Tommy; all these guys are junkies and they are stuck in a constant debate between choose a ""normal life"" (what is normal, anyway?) and the life style of a drug addict. So as the story unfolds, we see how they promise to quit drugs and almost immediately fall again in the addiction. Also, they hang around with the local psychotic drunk Begbie; he is not a junkie, but he loves to drink and to provoke fights with the slightest opportunity.
The movie shows some of the main consequences that the drug abuse brings: how you lose the perspective of the things that happen around you, how you affect your family and your closest friends, how you become a drug slave, how your body deteriorates, how you can become a threat to all the people, and how pathetic you can be once you become a junkie.
And yet, in ""Trainspotting"" we see that everybody has always choices: ""Choose life or choose not to choose life"". However this movie is not a preach...the only purpose of ""Trainspotting"" is to show you what can happen to you...after all, the choice is yours.",1057449600,10,1480,4.652671755725191
845263,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is a film that remind me of the time when we were young, and not so green. Plaesure to watch and compare your life with what it could've looked like, if you made a step away from the path. It's not violent and agressive, it's just a piece of art that makes all us, British People be proud of. Knowing that the comparison is not quite acuarate, I'll say that it's like having Grease for the Americans.
I definately advise everyone to see it, you'll just love (and not only because of the scene when Ewan McGregor dives into the toilet), but because of the scence that this film gives you: if you're older a scence of regret and nostalgia; and if you're young- it's just a must see movie, you'll find out why....",1056067200,,724,4.37037037037037
845264,5,6304297912,"The giant joke of Trainspotting is hidden in plain sight, obscured by the loaded topic of heroin. Certainly drug culture is everywhere in the movie, but the heart of the film is what the narrator, Ewan MacGregor's character, sees as the obvious link between heroin addiction and working. The central passage of the film is the scene where MacGregor and his mates sprint through the streets, with MacGregor doing the voiceover:

""Our only response was to keep on going and [*] everything, pile misery upon misery, heap it up in a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again-keep on going getting up going out robbing stealing and [*] people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day that it would all go wrong, because no matter how much you stash, or how much you steal, you never have enough, no matter how often you go out and rob and [*] people over, you always need to get up and do it all over again.""

It's a passage that sums up the twin futilities of junkiedom and working class life, and it's no accident that this scene begins with a sprint from a store and ends in a courtroom, marking the twin pillars of a free-market economy. Or that the motive for the sprint--a habit-inspired shoplifting attempt--turns the chase itself into a kind of rat race. It's also no accident that the unrepentant Sick Boy escapes, the cleverly insincere MacGregor gets off easy, while unwitting Spud is nailed to the wall in court. Or that when MacGregor gets clean, his debauched heroin-culture skills of lying, stealing and hustling make him well-suited to a job as a rental agent. Or that the only sincere character in the film is the one undone by deceit, heartbreak, and drugs.

In MacGregor's heroin world, the successful cheat as a rule, and they do it overtly; in his exposure to the working world, the same rules apply, everyone knows it, but no one admits it. In this conceit, Trainspotting emerges as a cynically perfect epitaph for American free-market culture spreading across Europe, with its heady mix of genuine aspiration, barely concealed greed, and deep denial--all neatly paralleled by heroin pleasure, heroin addiction, and the brain-addled values of the heroin culture.

So while being terrifically stylish and funny on a number of levels, Trainspotting's foundation is what makes it a great film--a disaffected, disillusioned narrator trading one socially rejected role for a socially acceptable one and failing to see the difference between the two. It's a fabulously clever movie with an unnerving argument rifling through every scene, and you should get this DVD.",1054944000,12,2663,4.884955752212389
845265,5,6304297912,"I've now seen this film about 10 times, and it stays fresh every time.  The acting, dialogue, music, cinematography, script...everything works together beuatifully.  The opening scene is especially unforgettable, probably the best marriage of music and film I've seen in a long time.
Instead of seeing this as a film about heroin addiction, a much better way of viewing this movie is examining WHY the central character played by Ewan McGregor, does heroin and WHY most mainstream people DON'T turn to chemical drugs.
Hint: listen to McGregor's voice-over at the beginning and at the end of the movie, when he goes into the rant about all the everyday addictions of ""normal"" people: materialism, conformity, mindless pop culture.
At the beginning of the film the narrator reads this laundry list of all our modern ""necessities"" with scorn; at the end, he reads it again but with mock enthusiasm as he flees the UK with a couple grand stolen from his buddies and promising to turn over a new leaf by embracing mainstream capitalist culture, affirming that he *will* indeed ""choose life.""
The genius of the film is that at that point you not only suspect he's just going to continue his drug life overseas but also you almost sympathize with him---look at the lame excuse for a ""life"" that most of us on the straight-and-narrow have.",1052611200,4,1331,4.911111111111111

It's not your average 'druggie with a plan' movie but instead it shows a group of heroin addicts living a really dirty life in a town that looks like it was painted all in a rust colour varnish. The acting is great as you can see the actors' portrayal of thier addictions as they sweat perfusely and go all crazy and on the edge just to get a hit. If you have the chance to watch the film I suggest you do because the narration done by Ewan McGregor in the film goes great with the trials and tribulations that him and his friends go through daily. In all if you want to see a movie that was 'groundbreaking' when it was released in theatres and now not even played once on any television show except those really type of sophisticated channels that show woman eating poo! Just kidding but this movie is not an elegant one and it gives you the muddy vision that the broken down town consumes of their lives. A true gen-X classic!

845271,4,6304297912,"This film is in a way a masterpiece that gives a vision of how young men influenced or organized by older men live in the margin of society, on the fringe of normalcy. They practice drugs as if it were some kind of hobby, not really to experience some drug-produced hallucinations but a drug-induced escape from real society, from fear, from hunger, from thirst, from their basic needs and impulses. Yet they reduce themselves to those very basic impulses and live an experience that has nothing else to propose, to offer but suffering from and amplifying those impulses. They find the morbid pleasure, at times deeply wrapped up in scatological regression, of experiencing these impulses without any limitations. This of course leads them to activities that have nothing to do with intelligence, the intellectual understanding of their alienations, but everything to do with considering society as a field  for their hunting, even scavenging. But what do they hunt ? Money, adventure, the power of doing what is forbidden, the thrill of getting into supposedly unexplored feelings and intense emotions. Their life becomes a jungle where emotions and feelings are driving forces and fascinating objectives. A baby dies because of the lack of care and love that is needed for it to survive or to live, but that death becomes the center of some  pleasure , the  pleasure  of suffering in the hands of death. One will thus die in this search by getting used to starving and finally passing away because this experiment has no other exit. One will be forced by his parents to go cold turkey and establish a distance between himself and that morbidity. Another will be sent to prison and forced to cut off from those extreme habits. And strangely enough it is those two who will manage to get some profit out of it, hence the means to cut off the umbilical cord that attaches them to this alienation. This epiphany will be reached through betrayal but it is seen by the two as some kind of a new beginning, as a door leading to another life, the life they have been longing for for so long, the life of normal people blending in the social mass around them, even if they have to escape to some other niche where their strange past can be unknown and forgotten. This is the dilemma of so many young people who want to experience adventure and a wilderness that does not exist naturally in our societies. They create with their own hands a wilderness in which they can experience the fear and dangers of a jungle that is more a creation of their own than real. And yet we have to come to the conclusion that our societies do enable such young people to find and build this jungle. Maybe this jungle is part of our societies, even if it is mostly invisible.

You are absolutely ruined and lost for any cause even that of dying in peace, in pieces maybe and in your own p**ss but not in silence and a restful atmosphere. One of them tries to get out but the leash is not severed in a minute and with a pen-knife. And he does not have a saw. Anyway the craziest of them all will catch up on him and bring him back into the pit, into the furnace and he will start being fried alive again.

If you can spot the train of liberation in that fable of alienation, tell me and don't forget to take it without asking anyone if you can.

845333,5,6304297912,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out. I was an active heroin user at the time, but also found the movie extremely good (what I could remember of it). Of course when I did see it, I was also under the influence of the drug, so i wasn't constantly conscience through parts of it. For the past 3 years i have been in recovery, and could NOT bring myself to watch it,(although I  did want to see it again) on account that I feared bringing heroin back into my thoughts, and perhaps thinking of only the ""good things"" it did for me. But anyway, I did decide to rent it just recently, because my wife, who is also in recovery, wanted to see it for the first time. The experience I got from it this time was not of glamour, but of the absolute, gut-wretching, not wanting to go on anymore, just wanting to end the pain and die attitude, and the dead-end street in had brought to my life. This movie is truly a wake-up call, and a remember when for me. Something I would NOT ever want to go back to, but also something I want to keep up front to remember what it really did do to my life and the depths it brought me down to. The junkie-life in Scotland, is the same there, as it is here or anywhere else in the world for that matter. The movie doesn't flinch from depicting the horrid consequences of heroin use, but it never lets you forget that most people do it because it feels better than anything else. It's surrealistic and speedy, in a rock video kind of way. It approachs the dead-end scene of heroin use. The movie is NOT for everyone. And as I read from one reviewer, probably not for most.

'Trainspotting' puts the viewer right inside the minds and lives of heroin addicted people, and it's not pretty. When we first meet our main character and narrator Renton (played with sheer brilliance by Ewan McGregor), he gets hit by a car, gets up, and laughs. Next thing we know, he's passed out on the ground in a hellhole known as Mother Superior's, a needle sticking in his arm. He introduces his other friends - most of them also drug users. There's Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), obsessed with James Bond, Spud (Ewen Bremmer), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the violently tempered Begbie (manically portrayed by Robert Carlyle). All of them have their obsessions and for Renton it's heroin. For me, this film has two parts. The first one is darkly funny (this part includes the infamous 'worst toliet in Scotland' scene, viewers with weak stomachs beware). The second (which begins around the time the baby dies) is intense, especially the detox scene. The film never flinches away from showing the viewer what these peoples lives are like. The apartments are rotting away, the people have no jobs, all they have is heroin and each other. There is nonstop language, stong sexual content including nudity, not to mention graphic herion use. The film is not for everyone, in fact I've found it's for very little. I happen to find every manic, funny, intense moment of this film entertaining. Others have found it depressing, weird, or just plain sick. So tread carefully. However, it's an important film and one that deserves to be seen.

Trainspotting is movie about moving on, making changes for the better and never looking back. Heroin, like in real life, is just an inhibitor.
The movie culls lots of elements into the movie. One minute you're laughing at the antics of Sick Boy and Renton as they're shooting people in the park with air-rifle, the next your cringing as Renton shudders painfully from his lapses of heroin. Its obvious that Trainspotting wants to try and do so much, and in its 90 minute ride, it manages to pull off everything it aims for with high sucess. Its funny, powerful, uplifting and for me inspiring. Not only that, but it's also got a kick [rear] soundtrack. Every part of the movie just screams character and gives it an even more compelling edge with the help of exciting pacing and orignal direcion(well for its time. Sadly MTV directors have managed to deteriate what was left of an effective direction style). Its an exceptional movie and recommend it to anyone who feels like their stuck in rut.

Drugs, this is a movie about drugs and thugs. Heroin is the main focus. Heroin and how it destroys junkies. Slowly. Painfully.  It ain't pretty. It's also about Renton, who is just smart/lucky enough and good or is it bad enough to kick the habit and get himself away to freedom, or is it another addiction, this time to middle-class materialism? I don't know. There's a lot going on.
It's the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cringe and grip your seat. You might even have to turn away at times. For God's sake don't watch it with a first date or your parents! There's poop and puking and the ""f word"" is rampant. There's violence and death and disease.
Sidenote: There are two Hamish MacBeth cast members in this movie, a shockingly great performance by Robert Carlyle, who plays Hamish MacBeth.

There is so many things in it which belong to the East of Scotland and the related culture (even some Glaswegians i know fail to recognise many of its quirks). This film crosses those barriers however because it is so well made, such good characters and so HILARIOUS!.
I hope this dispells any rumours by Americans, that we run around chasing sheep, and looking like Mel Gibson!! (ps we invented your loved possesion- the television!)",1025049600,,502,4.848837209302325
845375,5,6304297912,"I first caught Trainspotting in '96 when it was released in theaters. I had not read the book but I figured a movie about Scottish hoodlums who were heroin addicts sounded interesting, so I checked it out. Man, what a film! The cast was flawlessly assembled by director Danny Boyle and includes a career making performance by Ewen McGregor. But, McGregor's supporting cast is what really makes Trainspotting stand out above most other films. Robert Carlyle is simultaneously hilarious and chilling as Begbie, the elder statesman of the group who in fact is the only one who is not a heroin addict. As Renton(McGregor's character) states ""...Begbie didn't do drugs, he did people."" So true. Begbie is a psychopath in the purist sense of the word. He's a thief, a batterer, and a big time alcoholic, not the kind of guy you want to piss off. Carlyle literally steals every scene he is in and is almost impossible to understand with his ultra-thick Scottish accent. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, the pretty boy of the group who also happens to be the most well adjusted with the innate ability to dump his heroin addiction cold turkey. Ewen Bremner plays the dummy of the group to perfection, he is crude and slow-witted but ultimately good hearted. Ewen McGregor's Renton is a complex and dark character who is torn between doing the right thing and living a clean, normal life and his terrible addiction. Trainspotting is a realistic film. Renton doesn't just kick his habit but goes through several relapses. Renton wants a better life for himself but needs a break to get out of his lower class town and towards the end of the film the opportunity presents itself. Trainspotting has been called ""A Clockwork Orange for the '90's"" which I tend to disagree with. Trainspotting is not a visual journey as Clockwork is but they are both a study of human nature. Trainspotting's central characters are nowhere near as vicious as Kubrick's Droogs who raped, beat, stole, and terrorized at will. Boyle's characters have heart and you can feel their pain and emotions, you ultimately come to care about them. In Clockwork, Alex is finally getting his just desserts. Anyway, Trainspotting a great watch and addition to any DVD collection. Highly Recommended.",1024531200,14,2253,4.885117493472585
845376,5,6304297912,"Movies SHOULD make you think, and boy does this film do that!  ""Trainspotting,"" an uncompromising look into the lives of heroin addicts, is not for those with weak stomachs, or weak minds for that matter.  Is it anti-drug or pro-drug?  I don't know, but it sure turned me off from ever trying heroin.
Ewan McGregor's breakthrough role as Renton made him a star.  In this film, he is the dirtiest, skinniest, and most unattractive I have ever seen him.  But he's very good anyway.  He plays a young man with no ideals (until later) except having a good hit.  It's disturbing to watch what happens as he struggles to stay clean.
This is not a pretty picture.  This movie is sad, disgusting, and doesn't allow for sympathy for any characters except Renton only occasionally.  But it's engrossing.  You might be so appauled by what you see that you keep watching.  You might know someone who is a drug addict who struggles like these guys do and feel what they're going through in some fashion.  Or you might turn away from drugs altogether once you see the extreme of consequences.
Warning: You may hate this movie.  You may be offended.  If you are, I won't think less of you.  But remember, America does have a drug culture too, and there are people like Renton and Sick Boy (my God, and even Begby) present in our society. Sometimes movies show us things about ourselves that we don't want to see.  It's one of the most difficult cinematic tasks, but I think this movie pulls it off.",1023580800,,1483,4.5606060606060606
845377,5,6304297912,"While there is definitely a form of macabre humor to this tail, ""Trainspotting,"" one of the most brilliant films to come out of Britain in decades, is no laughing matter.
It captures an entire voice--a feeling--a depth of despair among a group of disaffected, addicted, hopeless young men in the slums of Edinburgh. Having been in Scotland many times, and known young men of this age, I found this grim portrait all the more frightening and heartbreaking. They are essentially beautiful young men (some of them, anyway) who are casually and uncaringly dying while injecting themselves unflinchingly with heroine.
No part of the heroine experience is hidden from the viewer, and I advise those who don't want to share the experience to avoid this movie. For the hovels, toilets, dingy bars, and alleys where these mates shoot up, and the close-up of the bloody needles, the mixing of the drug, and every other horror, is unrelenting. Add in the fear of AIDS, some hopelessly mindless and unfulfilling sex, a dead baby, real and hallucinated, and you have some idea of the nature of this film.
So what makes it so brilliant? Everything. From the acting of Ewan MacGregor et al. to the spare script, to the photography, to every last detail, this is the quintessential picture of despair in the true noir sense. It is very hard to watch, very hard to think about--but is an experience not to be missed, and it is one that does not leave you anytime soon.",1022716800,93,1451,4.761904761904762
845378,5,6304297912,"This movie is not for the faint of heart or those looking for a laid back movie.  This story of a group of friends, also heroin addicts, is so truthful and convincing that it will make your stomach twist.  I know it made me look at things in an entirely new way.
  Ewan McGregor as Mark Renton, the main character who wants to get off heroin but finds the road difficult with many falls back to addictive drug.  The entire story is through his eyes and how he views his so called mates and the situations they find themselves in.  McGregor slips into the role so thoroughly that you forget he's an actor and begin to truly think of only the character Mark Renton.  You, along with Renton, feel the highs and lows of heroin.  You feel his depression as he fights the addiction.
  The other characters, Spud, Sick Boy, Diane and Begbie are created so well that they all interact amazingly.  The script is wonderfully adapted from Irvine welsh's novel.  Many think the story is about how good heroin is, but the story is actually about true life. It doesn't glamorize anything.  You see the brillance of the drug at the characters first hit, but see the fatal and lows of it also as the characters fight to get off it or fall to new points of poverty financing their addiction.
  It's all around a brilliantly told story that is truthful and pulls not punches.  You see every detail, not just the bad and not just the good.  It's not everyone's type of movie, but if you're looking for a very well done piece of work, this is the movie.",1021939200,4,1533,4.398576512455516

No matter.  There's plenty of regurgitated junk out there to amuse them.

The soundtrack was top-notch - check out the two CDs it spawned.
The original book is an excellent read as well.  The movie was largely true to the book however there were a number of events that took place in the book that the movie didn't show.  Reading the book clarifies a few of the things that happen in the film - for example there is a scene in the movie where Spud does some amphetamine before going to a job interview.  I was unsure of his motivation (other than getting high) in the movie but in the book it was clear that he did the speed so that it would look like he was eager for the job, but wouldn't get it - so he could continue to receive his unemployment compensation from the government.
I recommended this movie highly to my parents and they didn't like it.  They found it to be quite sad and depressing, which I suppose I understand, but was not something I personally felt about it.",1015286400,7,1163,4.3119266055045875

I appreciated the fact that it painted a realistic picture of heroin addicts and their recoveries and relapses, European club life, and intertwined Aids, hanging around the wrong people but still calling them friends, and showing some light at the end of the tunnel without being cheesey or cliche.
McGregor was great as the lead character and the troubles his close circles of friends have was very a-typical of a serious drug addict.  The way they took advantage of him and displayed such bad taste and dishonesty, and their sleazy lifestyles is something any drug addict experiences most assuredly to some degree.  A normally good person with caring parents finds himself hanging out with losers and creeps and continually justifies his reason for putting up with them, and has to, because of his or her drug habit.
The scenes dealing with fecal matter were unnessecary I thought, a bit over the top and not very funny, just a bit too juvenille and shock-oriented, but regardless they were brief and the symbolism of him diving head first into a toilet was actually very good....that addicts will sink to almost any level to feed their habits, and do things they normally would never even think of sober.
This film really wasn't a black comedy to me, as many made it out to be, it was humorous at times, but also very serious and disturbing more often than not, without being depressing and unwatchable, such as ""Requiem For A Dream"" was in my opinion.

You obviously didn't watch the movie because not only are the characters utterly human, funny and emotional, they change and GROW considerably, vying for the viewers' sympathy.  You can't help but watch and see how each turns out.
And it could've been any one of us.  I'm not saying all of us have the capacity to become addicted to a drug, but it DOES happen, and these guys (we'll focus on the men) are REGULAR, football-playing, Sean Connery-loving guys who happen to have a lethal and expensive drug habit.  But what's so wonderful about this film is that the title character, Renton, WANTS to give it up, wants to come clean, and you WANT him to do it, of course.  He fails sometimes, but once he kicks it, you cheer for him, and you hope he has the capacity to stick to his guns.  You almost want to grab his hand and lead him to the end of the movie, making sure he'll be okay.  How powerful a character is that?
It's really brilliantly done.  In all honesty, the first time I saw it, I didn't understand it (the accents and the story-line), but seeing it again made me only want to see it more, because with every viewing, I fell in love with Mark Renton (not Ewan, but Mark).

Drug addiction is just one way of looking at it, and this prespective is done really well.

845485,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is an extraordinarily well crafted film in terms of the various elements of film technique- lighting, sound, acting, screenplay, dialogue, color, composition, camera and editing.

 The theme is fresh. Youth is a stage that is fraught with danger in testing the waters, and rites of passage, a stage that in modern western culture has no prearranged stage or ceremony.

 Neither are there role models nor family. The parents are out to lunch although they do their best- who doesn't? Volatile, sensitive Youth is for all practical purposes alone, dangerously alone, with no boundaries or self-control. Renton, our hero, does heroin. His unsavory pal does liquor and people. Self-afflicted damage vs damage to others is an under current theme of Trainspotting. Money is everywhere, as are drugs, those of discontent housewives, and those found in bars, as well as illegal ones. Self-medication is rampant, stylized (not glorified) in the film.

 Brilliant color schemes and set design hark back to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange yet add something new and different. Neglect of youth is generational and a threat to young life and society. Theme is brilliantly expressed via the superb acting of Ewan MacGregor and all the others. Nothing is left to chance, no detail too unimportant to convey, in the brilliant directing work of Danny Boyle.

The editing conveys the restless pace of angst-ridden young heroin addicts, along with the brilliantly selected score by Bowie and Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed, among others. In the opening scene alone, all the elements of film work together to present theme and introduce characters: Renton colliding with a moving car, grinning with bold mischief when he realizes he has triumphed over death; Sick Boy and Alison swooning with ectasy when they shoot up, the gaudily colored set vs the reality of the shabby drug house and neglected baby of young parents who are too busy trying to escape from reality to care for the one they love the most.

 All is incredibly and expertly choreographed to Bowie's and Iggy Pop's title track. Even the voice-over narration by Renton works remarkably well, a feat in and of itself, given the sorry track record of most film narrations. This is a tragic story, and far from ""glorifies"" hard drug abuse. It is also rich with blackly humorous dialogue, acting and camera work- the ""worst bathroom in Scotland ""scene, for instance. The film is visually stunning, poetically inspiring and meticulously directed. And it raises a few more questions about the values of society than it answers, which is what any decent work of art should do.",1005696000,8,2616,5.065116279069767

845487,5,6304297912,"The trio of producer Andrew McDonald, writer John Hodge and director Danny Boyle had had pretty good critical and reasonable commercial success with their debut feature Shallow Grave, but no one expected what was coming next. Out of the shadows, came a film about heroin addicts in Scotland that surely wouldn't be a success, would it?
 Trainspottings rise to cult status was a remarkable one. After all, it did not seem to have the automatic ingredients of a runaway hit. It may not have made a huge impact in the States, but in Britain it took the nation by storm. Everyone knew the name, the poster, probably some of the dialogue, even if they hadn't seen the film, and if you hadn't you felt like you were missing out on something special! In terms of a culture shift, there has been no more important film in the last 15 years. It relaunched British interest in Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, spawned countless imitators, and propelled six young actors into the limelight who will always be known for their roles in the film. It was also the platform for Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlysle to take on Hollywood. Believe me, if it wasn't for Trainspotting, someone else would have played Obi Wan in Phantom Menace and the villain in the World is Not Enough.
 So what makes this film so special. Great performances, cool soundtrack, sharp dialogue, a storyline that is as harrowing as it is funny. It really just captured the mood of a nation, and showed drug use with brutal honesty, not with glamour or with unneccesary preaching. Perhaps thats why it caused such a furore, not because it dared to state an opinion, because it dared not to. The truth is a dangerous thing.
 Being British in 1996 and seeing this was a very special thing, but it is still a magnificent film for any audience that withstands repeated viewings. A truly unique cinematic experience.",1003104000,2,1857,4.672782874617737

It is also gross and disgusting, as though Larry Flynt had gotten his hands on something like ""A Clockwork Orange."" But this Brit production with the heavy Scottish brogue (subtitles in places wouldn't hurt) is fortunately more than that; it is original and clever and moves right along. This is partly a cult film with all sorts of indie shibboleths and counter-cultural references; and partly an art film, with splashy sets and studied camera work; but mostly this is a full-blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB. (Yes, that is a left-handed compliment, unless, of course, you want to work for Sony or the WB. We'll have to check with director Danny Boyle on that.)
The opening theme (actually voiced over) is the idea that heroin or any really demanding addiction is preferable to ordinary life, an intriguing but stale notion designed to shock the bourgeoisie. The central theme proclaims that a heroin addict is just another kind of junkie, along with your cigarette, cola, beer, sex, grease, etc. junkies. (Bingo!) Yet at the end we see, as one might discover by watching all the commercials on PBS, that money will out. Kinda reminds me of what Omar Khayyam asked about wine nine hundred years ago: ""I wonder...what the Vintners buy/One half so precious as the stuff they sell."" Here the answer is clear: money itself. Closing theme: money triumphs over heroin; money is the power god of heroin.
Ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people. The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good; and the direction by Danny Boyle combines cartoon fantasy with stark realism, slick horror with black comedy, in a manner both derivative and sure to be imitated. The sound track, ""available on Capitol Records,"" (I rest my case) sold well. Some might say that this is a penetrating critique of modern urban society, but the only thing being penetrated is your pocket book. Yet, it is not a film to be ignored or forgotten.",999216000,5,2251,4.804123711340206

The dialogue is sharp (though it may take a viewing or two before the Scottish dialect can be understood), the soundtrack is excellent (singlehandedly reviving Iggy Pop's career; buy the soundtrack) and the direction by Danny Boyle is outstanding with numerous shots that have been copied by other, lesser directors.

845557,4,6304297912,"The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, ""Trainspotting,"" directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a ""way of"" life, they have ""become"" his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to ""Rents"" the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to.  The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the ""filthiest toilet in Scotland.""  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go ""cold turkey.""  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.  McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not.  The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, ""Trainspotting"" will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable.  A great companion feature to the more recent ""Traffic,"" this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.",984355200,,3648,4.668231611893583
845558,4,6304297912,"For some reason, people think this flick glorifies heroin.  It really bugs me that people think everything should be spelled out, that humanity is too stupid to stop and think for a second.  Do we really need every movie about drugs to be a more intelligent version of ""Reefer Madness?""
You have to be incredibly inobservant to think this movie, which has overdoses, formerly healthy people becoming junkies and promptly dying of AIDS, babies dying of neglect, a psychotic destroying everyone in his path, and other unpleasant things glorifies heroin in any way, shape or form.  Even leaving all those things out, these guys embarass themselves and make themselves look like jackasses often enough that you'd never want to be them.  Frankly, if people want to be junkies after seeing this movie, that's just natural selection.  Just because the direction is highly stylish (and Danny Boyle, the director, does a great job of being flashy without interfereing with the movie) doesn't mean the movie is a glorification.
It's very well written and acted, with Ewan McGregor leading the cast.  Also of note is Robert Carlyle, virtually unrecognizable under a walrus mustache, as the frightening Begbie.

845561,5,6304297912,"After the success of Shallow Grave, the triumvirate of  director Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald and writer John Hodge didn't sell out to Hollywood and grab the barrel loads of cash on offer. Instead they decided to take on the difficult project of filming the unfilmable, namely Irving Welsh's extreme, druggy vision, Trainspotting. The Edinburgh writer's cult novel is a shocking, sickening, but also blackly hilarious voyage into his city's dark nether regions, an dso is this film.
The movie follows the fortunes of likable, suede-head junkie Mark Renton (McGregor), and his dodgy gang of sidekicks: girl magnet Sick Boy, nerd Spud, and psycho Begsbie (Robert Carlyle). Exploring the oblivion and depredation of drugs, the film treats us to delights of acute diarrhea, 'toilet diving' in the filthiest toilet in Scotland, crime, unemployment, AIDS, copious vomiting, as well as some football. One of the more direct statements made in the movie is that being Scottish sucks. What is more apparent, however, is that being a f**ked up junkie sucks.
The fact that such unpromising material makes for compelling viewing is due to the sheer talent at work in the film. The center of the movie is Renton's cynical, world-weary view: ""One day their won't be men or women, just wankers"".
The soundtrack, mixing the cool of Lou Reed with techno and Britpop, is not a grubby attempt to cash in, but helps the atmosphere and the pacing of the movie.
McGregor's acting is assured. His sullen, hypnotic presence is the film's heart, but he is ably assisted by the other actors, particularly Robert Carlyle's Begsbie. Irving Welsh also makes an appearance as local dealer Mother Superior so called because of the length of his habit!
Certainly this is a dark and dirty, violent and sordid movie, but it is also strangely uplifting with a hint of optimism at the end. Hamstrung by its need to constantly make deals and cover all the bases, this is the kind of movie, Hollywood is no longer able to make.",980640000,19,1993,4.949253731343283
845562,5,6304297912,"The film which launched the career of Ewan McGregor was a mesmerising effort, recreating the dark and dingy existance of a group of Scottish heroin addicts brilliantly. Many scenes are wll and truly shocking, especially the dead baby scene and Renton's subsequent hallucination. At times it can almost make disturbing viewing, such as Renton famously diving headfirst into a toilet to retrieve some heroin, and the overdose scene with Lou Reed's Prefect Day in the background.
Either as a let-up from all this darkness or to make things even mroe stark, here are also sharp moments of humour, such as Spud's Speed-addled job interview and Renton casually talking the parents of Diane, a girl he had just slept with, thinks there her flatmates, before being shocked to see Diane come down the stairs in her school uniform. The way the sex scenes are melded together with video footage of a goal for Scotland's soccer team was unusual, and I challenge you not to laugh when Tommy puts a 'special' tape made of him in action with his girlfriend and is greeted by football, prompting him to think he may have returned the tape to the video shop!
Another standout aspect is the soundtrack. The guy who said he hated all the band son it must peddle a unique taste in music, as many of these tracks are classics. Not only the Lou Reed and Iggy Pop trackswhich may have introduced these veterans to a whole new generation, but also dance tracks like Ice MC's Boom Diggy Boom and Underworld's epochal Born Slippy. Sleeper's cover of Blondie's classic Atomic and tracks from Pulp and Blur add an 'indie' flavour.
All in all I can't recommend watching this enough. And all in all, if after seeing this film heroin appeals to you, you are a strangely sadistic being, as this in no way 'glorifies' heroin.",979776000,5,1792,4.728434504792332
845563,5,6304297912,"Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, ""Trainspotting"" centers around a group of youngsters who are controlled by their addiction to heroin. Set in Scotland, where the youth in question live on welfare money to support their habits, the main character Renton (played brilliantly by Ewen McGregor) decides to give kicking the habit another shot, and in the process of trying to sober himself he watches his life, and the lives of his friends, fall apart all around him.
There is an inescapable feeling of a loss of hope that emenates from just about every character in the movie. Such external factors as economy, lack of direction, lack of self-control, and fear of almost all things, including cheating thir bodies' craving and having to go through withdrawal, are all telling factors in how they each respond to the different obstacles they face throughout the movie.
The movie is definitely not without its funny points, and the dry humor that is seemingly rapid-fired by the characters as they engage in their normal activities of mischief hold substantially more comic value than is seen in most comedies these days.
The feeling of closure in the movie is very ambiguous for me. On one hand, you can definitely see a chapter of someone's life come to an end in a disheartening but nonetheless necessary fashion. On the other, the path ahead for the individual has a very ""Lady or the Tiger"" feel to it, although I'm sure the writers would have us believe that things end in a very good way.

845618,4,6304297912,"Trainspotting was the best film of 1996 in Great Britain and it continues to generate emotional polar opposite reactions today.  The film neither  glorifies drugs nor drug addicts but does illustrate in a graphic manner  the allure of drugs in today's society.  Four working class guys with  average educations, middle class backgrounds, and futures that don't seem  to hold much promise are drawn to the heroin-chic society of 80s Scotland.  The four, Renton, Sickboy, Spud, and Tommy become victims as the failure of  parents, social service agencies, the medical profession, and law  enforcement to intervene has little effect and success.  That the story is  set in Great Britain is irrelevant because the story is an American one as  well, and the problem defies national boundaries.  What is unique is the  humor and irrevent cheek of the four boys whose lives descend rapidly while  their habits become deadly.
Some video versions of the film have minor  variations but predominantly differ in the scenes of  sex between Renton  and Diane with fleeting glimpses of ecstacy rather than full frontal nudity  cut from the American theatrical release.  In addition,  the dubbing of  Ewan McGregor's opening monologue tones down his thick brogue for sensitive  American ears that fail to understand the Queen's English.  VCR or DVD  editions also feature interviews with the team of Boyle and MacDonald and  scenes deleted from the final cut, but whichever edition you have, its the  same story with only miniscule changes.  The soundtrack is a marvelous  compilation of music to shoot up by various artists and now is heard on  main stream television spots for automobiles in the US.  Brilliant  character acting by Robert Carlyle as Begbie and McGregor as Renton  introduced them to mainstream American audiences.

845621,5,6304297912,"""Trainspotting"" is another film that proves the vitality and originality of the British cinema.  The film pulsates with energy, talent and an  understanding of the heroin scene.  This is by-and-far one of the great  modern British films.  ""Trainspotting"" is a film, that along with ""Lock,  Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", proves that the American film industry does  not run the entire business.
Upon a viewing of Danny Boyle's 1996 film  ""Trainspotting"" you will laugh in hysterics, revolt in horror, gasp in  excitement and feel sick with disgust.  Any movie that can bring about such  an array of emotions has to be a high quality, well made film.  ""Trainspotting"" is just that.  It shows us a world that most of us have  never experienced (thankfully) but does exist and needs to be documented.  It takes no liberties, pulls no stops and presents it to us in such a  stark, gripping and entertaining manner that we end up feeling that we too  have somehow lived that live.
Some people bashed this film, saying it  condoned the use of drugs.  This quite simply is ridiculous.  Just because  the film doesn't preach at us and try to influence our views and merely  shows us this life, doesn't mean it condones drug usage. The film assumes  we can figure out for ourselves that this is no way to live and I think  most of us did.  If anything the film makes us want to stay away from  drugs.
The story is about a group of five friends in Edinburgh, Scotland:  Renton, Begbie, Sick Boy, Spud and Tommy.  Three of the lads are addicted  to heroin but only Renton seems to have any interest in kicking the habit.  The lads fall in and out of many situations throughout the film including  AIDS, prison and a hilarious happening involving a tape of Tommy and his  girlfriend.  But no matter what they're up to, the most important thing is  always heroin.  All their actions revolve around it whether it be getting  it, doing it, selling it or kicking it.
A police officer I met, who works  the drug/slum area in Vancouver said that this film was the most realistic  portrayal of addicts he had ever seen and from what I know I'd have to  agree with him.  ""Drugstore Cowboy"" is the only other film I can think of  that tackles the drug culture so realistically.
The acting is fantastic,  with Ewan McGregor as Renton being a standout.  He manages to put some  credibility and human qualities to a type of person we would often think of  as inhuman.  Mix the great acting with the perfectly timed and energetic  directing of Danny Boyle (including one fantastic withdrawal sequence) and  add in one great soundtrack including Iggy (not Ziggy) Pop and Blur and  you've got yourself a beautiful and brilliant movie.

In  Trainspotting, we get to see inside the world of illicit drugs through the  eyes of heroin-addict Mark Renton. Instead of outright preaching to us, the  filmmakers strived to show reality, and let us decide for ourselves.

I had heard some not so pleasant things about it, but decided to take the plunge and find out for myself.  I  was absolutely blown away.  It was all things to me, interesting, shocking,  visually stimulating, enthralling, and highly emotional.  The actors  themselves did an outstanding job in their respective roles, and were  eerily convincing as junkies.  I found myself truly envolved with the  characters, through their exstasy and agony, their loss and gains.  Ewan  McGregor is pure genius, and has a certain quality that makes you really  connect to his character.  This is a disturbing film.

What struck me most about the movie was how it realistically portrayed drug addiction: there  was no romantisization. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that could  be so funny (the toilet scene, the trip to the outdoors, etc) and so  terribly tragic (the baby scene, the overdose, hallucinations).  This movie  really makes you appreciate your own life, that is for sure.  Wonderful  acting and dialogue.

845703,5,6304297912,"This excellent film portraying the grim reality of drug culture in today's society is something every one should see. Told in a poignant and intelligent way through the eyes of Renton (Ewan McGregor) we immediately  sympathise with him and follow him through his miserable life as a drug  addict. To prevent us from turning away from the nasty bits in the tale  there are some incredibly funny bits which add to the tragedy of the tale,  a brilliant soundtrack and a good pace as well as some fascinating, though  hardly likeable, characters such as the psychotic Begbie and wide boy Sick  Boy.
A very good film indeed and is certainly a good public health  warning against drug-taking.",956016000,,686,4.811965811965812
845704,5,6304297912,"Trainspotting is a film completely lacking in moral fibre and is all the better for it. As many critics waited for that scene where our hero(or anti-hero) regrets his sins, the scene of redemption, a scene that never  came, they decided the film was morally corrupt.
  In fact Trainspotting  never flinches when showing the sometimes harrowing effects of addiction  (the fate of the baby and Tommy come to mind). The fact that the characters  in the film remain unrepentant inspite of that speaks more to their  character then any positive aspects of drugs.
  These characters  represent anarchy, nihilism and a lust for life, things we all love to  watch, yet hipocritically like to take the moral highground by requiring  these character to suffer in agony for their way of life. Trainspotting in  too original and yes too realistic to take that route. If you are offended  by the lack of moral redemption in movies like Trainspotting and Figh Club,  ask yourself this question: Why did you enjoy the anarchy in the beginning?
  Renton is a person that none of us would like to be around, but he is  undoubtly exhilerating to watch. Like the lead character in GOODFELLAS  Henry Hill, he is unrepentant by the end of the movie. But as Roger Ebert  observed about Hill ""his only regret at the end of the movie is that  he had no more soul to sell."" Renton on the other hand ""chooses  life"" as a practical measure, a calculated descion to lead a more  trouble free life, not a moral one.
  The film as a whole is like a bolt  of lightening, a shot of adrenaline. I promise that you won't shift in your  seat once before the end-credits. Director Danny Boyle's visual imagination  is unending, some scenes manage to be puke-worthy disgusting and  bone-achingly funny at the same time.
  Come to think about it,  Trainspotting could have had a hero who has a conscience, who loves his  girlfriend, who fears his parents, who is loyal to his friends. Come to  think about it again, WHO WOULD WANT TO WATCH A THING LIKE THAT.",955238400,5,2020,4.644886363636363
845728,3,6304297912,"so i was pumped to get trainspotting on dvd because it is one of my all-time favorites and, i figured, very deserving of being enjoyed on the dvd format.  much to my dismay, i got it home, watched it, and discovered  that the remastered dvd audio track is different!
the voiceovers have  slightly different monologue, and in many of the key scenes in the movie,  dialog was slowed down/ enunciated -- i assume to make it more easily  understood by USA citizens.  the downside to this is lots of the emotion  and effect is taken out of key scenes when doing this -- examples are the  spud on speed scene and the opening voice-over.  renton's first utterance  of ""choose life"" (when he gets hit in the head with a soccer  ball) is cut off before he even finishes saying life!  what a  travesty!
in short, buy the dvd AND the vhs, wire your sound system so  audio is coming from the vcr only, and watch the dvd on your monitor.  this  is the best of both worlds.  this is one of the greatest movies ever -- it  has to be experienced to the fullest!",955065600,3,1045,4.298969072164948

The characters are, in no way, every day people but the  film makes them all believable and, in the end the viewer finds that they  are relating to the characters and caring about the outcome. Despite the  hysteria that greeted this film in the UK's conservative press, in no way  does it glorify the use of heroin. Instead it paints a pretty offputting  picture of the drug.
The film ranges from sad to funny and it is always  gripping. A great film.",954633600,,687,4.362204724409449
845730,5,6304297912,"...but a very real view on the horrors of seriously hard drugs such as heroin. Sharp, witty, superbly acted and directed this film offers bright and clever humour along with deeply harrowing warnings for everyone to take  notes from. A group of disillusioned Scottish youngsters are at the bottom  and digging themselves even further down. Addicted to heroin and involved  in crime to feed his habit one of them, Renton, (McGregor) decides, yet  again, to give it up. But how on earth is he going to do that when his  loser junkie friends just won't leave him alone?
Ewan is good as the guy  narrating the story but Robert Carlisle (playing a seriously dangerous  psycho) and Ewen Bremner steal the show with their performances.
Gritty,  scary stuff which everyone should see to help them realise that the drugs  just don't work and they most definitely make things worse.",953510400,2,872,4.837837837837838

845734,5,6304297912,"'Trainspotting' definitely lived up to the hype that surrounded the film when it was released a few years ago. Its portrayal of a motley crew of heroin addicts and sociopaths is done with an impeccable eye for direction  and is effectively chilling. The film does not glamorize the use of drugs  in any fashion, though criminals might mistake the film as a paean to their  lifestyle. No judgments are made here: the demented world of these  characters is placed before the viewer with all of its consequences. The  squalor and decay of addiction is evident throughout the film.  What  stands out are the performances. Ewan McGregor is spectacular in his  character's willful helplessness against heroin addiction. He is  spine-tingling in his complacency, his moral indifference. Robert Carlyle  is frightening as the psychotic Begbe; his versatility as an actor is on  fine display, especially compared with his roles in Priest and The Full  Monty. The rest of the cast does an exquisite job of portraying the utter  meaninglessness that becomes part and parcel of the heroin-addicted life.  The film has its intense and revolting moments--the toilet scene is not for  a weak stomach and the 'cold turkey' scene, complete with dead baby  crawling along the ceiling, is also disturbing. However, if the viewer is  open to a hard-hitting dose of reality with an ensemble of unlikeable but  well-portrayed characterizations, Trainspotting will please. The soundtrack  is actually a compliment to this film, rather than a detriment, featuring  the music of Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, among others.",950140800,3,1590,5.1607843137254905

845736,4,6304297912,"Trainspotting can't help but be a deeply affecting experience. Having just seen it for the first time I feel mired in it. This film makes you feel frustrated, pent-up and desperate to to change your life radically, as if  in the depths of a vicious, destructive cycle. This feeling is hard to  shake even when you realize that you're not, in fact, hopelessly addicted  to heroin with the only bright spot in your life a young Lolita who you  keep seeing simply because if you break it off, she'll turn you in to the  cops. In a plot I kept expecting to become maudlin or 'Hollywood,' the film  is without identifiable holes, right down to the ending, which is not what  you would expect, except if you realize that the only possible choice is to  do what is not expected. Ewan McGregor is excellent in his breakthrough  role and Robert Carlyle is very strong, if miles away from his role as  'Gaz,' the lead in ""The Full Monty."" The DVD version is a clean,  sharp transfer, although there are no special features. However, I'm not  sure how relevant that is because I can't imagine anyone wanting to see  this possessing film enough times to want to own it. As excellent and  gripping as it is, I'll be glad to get this out of my system.",949104000,7,1237,4.44
845805,3,6304297912,"Well, this is a good movie to watch if you want to keep your kids away from heroin!  This story of heroin addict Renton (a very excellent Ewan McGregor)and his bizarre, offbeat addict buddies is one that has to be seen  to be believed.  Renton tries several times to escape his addiction; he  fails every time.  In between his journeys to semi-sobriety are surreal  moments, partially due to the camera angles, and the hallucinations he  suffers when going through withdrawal.  It is really difficult to describe  what this film is about;it shows the ups and downs that a heroin addict  suffers.  It also takes place in Scotland, and, being an American, it can  be difficult at times to understand exactly what is being said. Still,  though, it is one wild ride, and it has one great soundtrack.  The opening  credits booming Iggy Pop's great song ""Lust for Life"" was enough  to get me hooked. You have to see this film to believe it. And you should  see it.  Once.

I only got one person who said they liked it, and everyone else thought the film glamorized drug use. I had to see  and decide for myself. While the film isn't a masterpiece, it's at least  worth a Friday night rental. The story concerns Scottish heroin addict Mark  Renton deciding to go clean and ditch his loser friends. He gets into real  estate in London and, just when life's looking good, his buddies come back  and hook him on drugs again. I think some people believe that this film  glamorizes and promotes drug use because the main characters shoot up as if  it's nothing -- well that's what addicts do! This film is anti-drug,  because Renton struggles to free himself and never gives up. Because of  this, the film ends on an upbeat, hopeful note. It's worth checking out,  people.",947980800,,885,4.615384615384615
