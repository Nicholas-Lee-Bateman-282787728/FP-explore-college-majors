3067276,5,B0011NVCAW,I bought this dvd to keep my two year old entertained for a very long road trip. He did not watch the entire dvd. He did watch Jack's Big Music Show and Yo Gabba Gabba. I think it is a great buy because you have multiple shows on one disc.,1245715200,,239,3.8
3067277,5,B0011NVCAW,This is a fabulous video.  It has episodes of your kids favorite Nick Jr. shows.  You can't go wrong with this one.,1238716800,,115,4.181818181818182
3067278,5,B0011NVCAW,This DVD I would most deffinetly recommend! It's great! My son who is 1 watches it almost everynight before bed. It is very entertaining for the little one and I find myself right beside him singing along.,1238371200,,205,4.5675675675675675
3067279,5,B0011NVCAW,This DVD arrived quickly and in great condition! I look forward to doing business with this seller in the future.,1230163200,,113,4.7
3067280,4,B0011NVCAW,"My 2-year old son loves Noggin, so he is already a fan of Dora, Diego, Blues Clues, Wonder Pets and Yo Gabba Gabba.  It's a cute DVD.  I actually like the Yo Gabba Gabba section.  Yes, it's odd, but they have great messages to their songs about nap time, being scared and lonely when you go to sleep and about dreaming happy thoughts.  They're catchy, sweet little tunes.  I even caught my husband singing on the other day.  Overall, I think it delivers what it suggests...a good collection of age appropriate bed time stories.",1225324800,22,527,4.553191489361702
3067281,5,B0011NVCAW,This item is great for any child who loves Noggin shows! My granddaughter loves Yo Gabba Gabba and Blue and Jack and this is a great video as it has several shows on one DVD! I recommend this to other Noggin fans!,1219622400,6,213,4.095238095238095
3067282,3,B0011NVCAW,"I picked this DVD up when it was a brand-new release.  It contains the following episdoes:

Dora the Explorer: ""Little Star"" - A great episode!

Blue's Clues: ""Tickety's Favorite Nursery Rhyme"" - Pretty good episode.

Wonder Pets: ""Save the Three Little Pigs/Save the Owl"" - Excellent Episodes!

Jack's Big Music Show: ""The Music Monster"" - I had never seen any episodes of this show before.  I personally think it lacks any educational value and find it a bit strange honestly.  Not my favorite.

Yo Gabba Gabba: ""Sleep"" - Another show I'd never seen before.  I find it really weird and pretty pointless.  Not to mention the characters remind me too much of the Teletubbies.

Blue's Room: ""Sprinkle's Sleepover."" - A great episode!

My daughter (2 years old) and I enjoy 4 of the 6 episodes.  So it's not bad.  I'm not sure I'd buy another Nick Jr. collection though.",1210982400,24,868,4.738255033557047
3067283,4,B0011NVCAW,I like the variety of stories and characters that are used. I don't think it works to put the children in a relaxed mood to fall asleep. Seller did a great job of sending it out right away and safely. Would order from seller again.,1460246400,,231,4.155555555555556
3067284,1,B0011NVCAW,The excessive advertising and trailors in the beginning are downright annoying and unacceptable in a child's video.  My grandson doesn't like this one.,1457308800,,151,5.565217391304348
3067285,5,B0011NVCAW,I play this for my son when he is going to sleep and it definitely helps him calm down and relax and drowns out the noise of the rest of the house.,1457049600,,147,3.625
3067286,5,B0011NVCAW,"Okay so let me start by this dvd is amazing! Then let me say if you buy this DVD you might want to watch it out od order starting with Jacks big music show then yo gabba gabba then from there because those two will make your little one want to ""get the wiggles out"" lol second let me say if you see the one star review about a ""Halloween"" episode that just absolutely scared someone's child DO NOT listen to them! There is NO Halloween episode again NO HALLOWEEN episode. It has to do with Jack bits magic show where they have to show a cute little monster ""Henrey"" how to be ""scary"" which is mostly singing and dancing and them curly rawing and making nosies and if that scares your child no offence buttttt your child might be a tid bit of a sissy. Lol I love this DVD my fdaughter watch's it almost everyday getting ready fro bed! So enjoy and deff a great purchase!!",1456790400,,870,4.184523809523809

3067310,5,B0011NVCAW,My son loves watching this before bed. He sings and dances and it gives him helpful advice on how to go to sleep when hes having trouble. It has a variety of shows so he doesn't get bored with just watching one. I am happy I bought this for him!,1399507200,,245,3.92
3067311,1,B0011NVCAW,Thought this was a book. Didn't want a cd. Oh well. Live and learn. Will look closer next time. Bye.,1390089600,,100,4.05
3067312,5,B0011NVCAW,"Grandchildren ages 1-4 love these programs. We have 3 children with special needs in their teens... they, too prefer Dora and other Nickelodeon Jr. Programs. And... I should add, because they're played in adult's presence - they are great for ""kids of all ages"".",1389052800,2,262,4.9772727272727275
3067313,5,B0011NVCAW,"My son loves Blues Clues and Yo Gabba Gabba, but has never really been interested in anything else. However, he loved every minute of this DVD on our road trip! He had a cold and was cranky, but this DVD actually helped him relax.",1382659200,,230,4.25
3067314,5,B0011NVCAW,"I've had to buy like three or four of these, just because they're played so much the XBox burns 'em up. It's a great set of videos set to send your kid off to dreamland. My only head-scratcher is the Jack's Big Music Show episode about monsters. Not really night time friendly if your kid is in that 'there's monsters under the bed' phase. :/",1379462400,,342,4.276923076923077
3067315,3,B0011NVCAW,"I thought this was more of a relaxing night time video but it's really long and it's just the regular episodes that are sleep related.
We still love it though and it got us hooked on Wonder Pets :)",1377129600,,197,4.076923076923077
3067316,4,B0011NVCAW,Helps my 2 year old get into her bedtime routine. Settling down for the day watching her favorite characters do the same.,1375660800,,121,4.545454545454546

3067319,5,B0011NVCAW,my daughter was so excited when this came in perfect condition an very happy with it now we have to watch this ove rand over,1358121600,,124,4.0

3067321,4,B0011NVCAW,"I love the variety of stories on here but I don't think very many of them were related to sleepytime stories.  But, my daughter enjoys watching it and that's what matters.",1319328000,,171,4.516129032258065
3067322,5,B0011NVCAW,"I love the sleepy-time cartoons, works as a great incentive for my little ones to great ready for bed, makes wind down time really nice.",1310083200,,136,4.48
3067323,5,B0011NVCAW,"I never read to my child at night since we only read during the day and I prefer to read in the morning so he (hopefully) does not associate reading with sleeping. We talk about our day at night, but he was still not tired enough to go to sleep, so I saw this and wanted to try it out! I got this DVD for my 7 year old son about a month or so ago and when I put it on he goes to sleep in about 10 minutes! I know there is that new book out called, ""Go the F&*% to Sleep"" and if this DVD works as well on your child as it does for my ADHD 7 year old there would be no such book! We have not had cable (I HATE all of the ads!) in years, so he knew the characters, but has not seen them much since he was a toddler, so maybe that helped. The first one is Dora and a star. Very cute! It does the whole automatic replay all night which is really nice and vey helpful. It does have ads for more DVDs in the beginning, but they do not show after the first time around. I have recommended it to other parents. We just love it! I hope this review is helpful!",1309046400,,1049,3.6875
3067324,4,B0011NVCAW,My son loves all of his favorite characters coming together to say goodnight. Only one small issue with the Wonder Pets episode. They used the big bad wolf which scares him and gives him nightmares. He loves the Wonder Pets just not this episode. The rest of the DVD is great I just have to forward past the one small part. Definitely great for preschoolers.,1308614400,2,358,4.523076923076923
3067325,3,B0011NVCAW,"I own a babysitting service in the Napa Valley, and wanted to see what parents were recommending for the 2-10 age range.  I bought this one.  It has a nice variety of stories, but don't use this to ""relax"" with.  The Yo Gabba Gabba ""Sleep"" section encourages them to get up and dance.
Although I prefer to read, sometimes a movie with a positive theme is just what is needed to relax hyperactive children.  What I did love about the gabba story, was it mentions issues a child may have in falling asleep and encourages positive thinking and happy thoughts which a little 4 year old girl I was watching one evening TOTALLY appreciated.

It has it's positives....",1288396800,4,661,4.567796610169491
3067326,5,B0011NVCAW,"This is a great DVD with a variety of shows and episodes relating to bedtime and sleep. My toddler really enjoys it, and all the music and the episodes turned out to be some of my 'favorites' that I've seen on Nick Jr. also. The price is also cheaper than I've seen it in the stores for. Definitely recommend!",1276732800,2,309,4.254237288135593
3067327,5,B0011NVCAW,"My son loves this DVD. It has all of his favorite characters, especially the Yo Gabba Gabba gang! I even like that show because the songs are so catchy! Great idea for a DVD. They need a winter special now (a snowy day DVD). That would be cute!!",1269907200,,245,4.125
3067328,4,B0011NVCAW,I am so glad that we were able to find the Yo Gabba Gabba nap time show on this dvd. We couldn't find it in any stores. We were happy that we recieved it as soon as we did.,1268784000,,172,3.4358974358974357
3067329,5,B0011NVCAW,"This is a great DVD.  I wouldn't say it makes my daughter sleepy (nothing does!), but it is entertaining, and she does not get sick of it.  cute music, cute skits, and just an overall cute collection of stories with the best Nick Jr. Characters.",1266364800,,245,4.4222222222222225
3067330,5,B0011NVCAW,"This video was a great addition to our son's collection (who is a year and a half. He already loved Dora and Yo Gabba Gabba when we got this for him. However, after watching it maybe 2 times, he was greatly entertained by the whole DVD. He now sings to Jack's Big Music Show tunes, even though he had never seen it before. This is a good investment when you need time off, especially to clean up around the house. Awesome for your child, and you!",1248480000,,446,4.1976744186046515
3067331,5,B0011NVCAW,We purchased this DVD recently and my boys who are 5 and 2 love it.  I like the fact that it has variety.  This will definitely be one we take on vacation later this summer.,1247875200,,173,3.914285714285714

3301807,5,B0011NVCAW,My son loves watching this before bed. He sings and dances and it gives him helpful advice on how to go to sleep when hes having trouble. It has a variety of shows so he doesn't get bored with just watching one. I am happy I bought this for him!,1399507200,,245,3.92

3301809,5,B0011NVCAW,"Grandchildren ages 1-4 love these programs. We have 3 children with special needs in their teens... they, too prefer Dora and other Nickelodeon Jr. Programs. And... I should add, because they're played in adult's presence - they are great for ""kids of all ages"".",1389052800,2,262,4.9772727272727275

3301811,5,B0011NVCAW,"I've had to buy like three or four of these, just because they're played so much the XBox burns 'em up. It's a great set of videos set to send your kid off to dreamland. My only head-scratcher is the Jack's Big Music Show episode about monsters. Not really night time friendly if your kid is in that 'there's monsters under the bed' phase. :/",1379462400,,342,4.276923076923077
3301812,3,B0011NVCAW,"I thought this was more of a relaxing night time video but it's really long and it's just the regular episodes that are sleep related.
We still love it though and it got us hooked on Wonder Pets :)",1377129600,,197,4.076923076923077

3301818,4,B0011NVCAW,"I love the variety of stories on here but I don't think very many of them were related to sleepytime stories.  But, my daughter enjoys watching it and that's what matters.",1319328000,,171,4.516129032258065

3301820,5,B0011NVCAW,"I never read to my child at night since we only read during the day and I prefer to read in the morning so he (hopefully) does not associate reading with sleeping. We talk about our day at night, but he was still not tired enough to go to sleep, so I saw this and wanted to try it out! I got this DVD for my 7 year old son about a month or so ago and when I put it on he goes to sleep in about 10 minutes! I know there is that new book out called, ""Go the F&*% to Sleep"" and if this DVD works as well on your child as it does for my ADHD 7 year old there would be no such book! We have not had cable (I HATE all of the ads!) in years, so he knew the characters, but has not seen them much since he was a toddler, so maybe that helped. The first one is Dora and a star. Very cute! It does the whole automatic replay all night which is really nice and vey helpful. It does have ads for more DVDs in the beginning, but they do not show after the first time around. I have recommended it to other parents. We just love it! I hope this review is helpful!",1309046400,,1049,3.6875
3301821,4,B0011NVCAW,My son loves all of his favorite characters coming together to say goodnight. Only one small issue with the Wonder Pets episode. They used the big bad wolf which scares him and gives him nightmares. He loves the Wonder Pets just not this episode. The rest of the DVD is great I just have to forward past the one small part. Definitely great for preschoolers.,1308614400,2,358,4.523076923076923
3301822,3,B0011NVCAW,"I own a babysitting service in the Napa Valley, and wanted to see what parents were recommending for the 2-10 age range.  I bought this one.  It has a nice variety of stories, but don't use this to ""relax"" with.  The Yo Gabba Gabba ""Sleep"" section encourages them to get up and dance.
Although I prefer to read, sometimes a movie with a positive theme is just what is needed to relax hyperactive children.  What I did love about the gabba story, was it mentions issues a child may have in falling asleep and encourages positive thinking and happy thoughts which a little 4 year old girl I was watching one evening TOTALLY appreciated.

It has it's positives....",1288396800,4,661,4.567796610169491

However, after watching it maybe 2 times, he was greatly entertained by the whole DVD. He now sings to Jack's Big Music Show tunes, even though he had never seen it before.
