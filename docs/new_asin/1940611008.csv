7802178,5,1940611008,"There seems to be a lack of good longarm information available, so as a new long-arm quilter, I was glad to find something that showed more than the basics I receive from my dealer. The show is sponsored by Handi-Quilter and YLI thread, so they are used exclusively, but the information is easily applied to other products. Shows are paced well, with a minimum of fluff, and packed with all sorts of techniques and information beyond the usual. Does not replace basic instruction from your dealer, assumes you already have that, but takes you a step beyond. I will get Season 2 soon as it is available.",1397779200,5,602,4.635514018691588
