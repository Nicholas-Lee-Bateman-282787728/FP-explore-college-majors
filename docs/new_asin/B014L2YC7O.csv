7414174,1,B014L2YC7O,I love this show and have waited for this release but the price is absurd.  I won't be purchasing.  Too bad.,1441065600,7,108,4.095238095238095
7414175,1,B014L2YC7O,"I haven't been waiting for this series nearly as long as lot of fans have been waiting, but at this price point, I'm going to wait a little longer.  Many of us already own the first season. Why in the world would we pay so much for what amounts to three seasons?",1441065600,7,262,4.038461538461538

7414190,5,B014L2YC7O,I had purchased season 1 many years ago. When I saw this complete series version I had to get it. I loved watching it and did a marathon watch session.,1519171200,,151,4.066666666666666
7414191,4,B014L2YC7O,"This was an awesome show. It got a little repetitive in the other seasons but still good. The 80's tech doesn't really stand up to modern levels anymore and some of the problems in the show (like where to make a phone call) aren't even in today's lexicon. Still, gotta love a show that actually has an ending, instead of being cancelled.",1518912000,,337,4.451612903225806

7414194,5,B014L2YC7O,"I first watched this show when it aired on UPN and fell in love with it immediately. I waited years for the complete set to come out on DVD and am so happy to have that wish fulfilled. As a lover of cop shows and science fiction/fantasy, and as a believer in spirit animals, the story of the modern-day Sentinel and his Guide appealed to me.  They inspired many of their fans to support various environmental causes, including wolf and big cat sanctuaries. After a friend had surprised me with a set, I ordered this one for someone else I had met through the fandom, a person who has become like a sister to me. Say what you will about it, but for me, The Sentinel is magical on so many levels.",1511654400,,694,4.257575757575758
7414195,5,B014L2YC7O,Very please with this purchase as I had been waiting for the whole series to be available for many years. The one downside was one of the disc's were damaged. However the merchant was very helpful with correcting the issue and made everything seamless. I would highly recommend this series.,1510963200,,290,4.82
7414222,3,B014L2YC7O,"I love this cheesy old bit of 90s television, with its unique premise and fun cast, but zero points for my buying experience here. I paid for the 17-disc set when it went on sale and instead received the cheaper 12-disc set, with all the DVDs in plain little sleeves instead of proper cases. I didn't even bother trying to play them, not with such an unprofessional look. While the cover art was nice, the box was very strange - such an oddly large case when only one little square of space is actually used for the DVD sleeves. It all seemed very amateurish and not something I felt was worth the price, so it's being returned. Disappointingly, Amazon only offered the free return, no attempt whatsoever to send the correct product, so I guess I'm out of luck with that 17-disc set (and of course, the price is back up again).",1506729600,10,827,4.447368421052632

7414224,4,B014L2YC7O,"I love this TV series. However this particular copy is rather cheap. The voice is scratchy, and has an echo. the color skips out to black and white.
It is watchable 5 stars for the series only 2 for the quality of disks.",1501027200,2,220,4.1395348837209305

7414231,5,B014L2YC7O,I am SO glad they finally released this series in its entirety!  The episodes are all there and the video and sound quality is great on my HDTV (video quality is actually better than I expected given the age of the series).  There are no extras or bloopers - just simply the episodes.  Very happy purchaser here!,1488499200,7,312,4.43859649122807

7414233,4,B014L2YC7O,"As a long-standing TS fan, I was thrilled when the box set FINALLY got released, and ecstatic when I got one. The quality has been great so far (at this point, I'm about halfway through). There have been a few glitchy moments, but I attribute that to my several-years-old device more than to the DVDs. I'm taking a star off for the presentation, specifically with the way the synopses are given. They're printed underneath the plastic that holds the discs, which I'd never actually seen before in a box set. I understand that it may have been more cost-effective to print them that way, but I'm someone who has always enjoyed reading the material that comes with entertainment media - be it lyric sheets, liner notes or whatever. I like booklets. From a practical standpoint, any information added to a disc set is just easier to read in a book format. To have to remove the discs, then tilt and turn the box to see around the little notches that hold the discs just to read the plot line, while not a deal-breaker, is annoying. I appreciate not having to pay an arm and a leg to watch one of my favorite shows, but I would've spent a bit more to have a little classier product.",1487462400,7,1178,4.458333333333333

7414237,3,B014L2YC7O,"The Sentinel of the Great City and his little guppy are finally on DVD! While the set does contain every episode of the series, some of the episodes have issues with the quality of the recording the DVD was made from. For example, one episode, the sound cuts out for about thirty seconds, another had a yellow cast to the film and some have an odd static-like quality to the soundtrack. It is great to have the whole series finally available, but the overall engineering could be better.",1486857600,2,487,4.545454545454546

7414273,5,B014L2YC7O,Love this series.  So glad it is available on dvd.,1479513600,,50,4.0
7414274,5,B014L2YC7O,So glad the entire series is finally on Amazon! I've loved this show since I first watched it and I actually watched my old S1 box set at least 5 times before this came out. Great little crime show from the 90s - the cases each episode are interesting/unique and the Sentinel subplot weaving throughout the whole show is amazing. The acting is honestly great too - the delivery of the deadpan lines is perfect to invoke laughter and there's only minor over-acting in the most dramatic episodes. (And who doesn't love seeing Richard Burgi with his shirt off? wink wink),1477526400,,568,4.633663366336633
7414275,3,B014L2YC7O,"It was great when I first saw this on TV,  for the first time.

7414281,1,B014L2YC7O,"I love this show and treated myself to buying the set for my birthday.  Sadly, none of the disks would play in my computer drive or on my regular DVD player.  In the computer it would load noisily, play the intro, but then on the menu it just wouldn't let me select and play any of the actual episodes.  I tried all the disks for season one, two of season two and random disks in 3 and 4.  I know it's not my computer drive because I got out my Sentinel season one that I bought several years ago that was sold separately and produced by another company and it played fine.  I also tried using two different software applications, VLC and Cyberlink, to play the dvds, but neither of them worked.  Since I play most of my DVDs on my computer this was not a good thing.

So, I tried them in my regular DVD player and the disks were rejected as an unknown format.  None of them would load.

Also, I have to say the packaging wasn't very professional looking.  I've had better sets of DVDs made by amateur fans at conventions.

All in all this was a major disappointment.  I really wanted to have a complete professional set for one of my favorite shows and I didn't get it.",1471737600,8,1170,4.2207207207207205

7414284,4,B014L2YC7O,I watched this show as a kid back when it was on TV and quite enjoyed revisiting Jim and Blair's adventures.  For those who haven't seen it there are strict procedural cop show elements as Jim learns and uses his Sentinel abilities to solve crimes.  As I said I quite enjoyed the show and only took a star off because the sound quality on many of the episodes is quite poor and did not translate well over to DVD.,1470268800,4,413,4.215189873417722
7414285,5,B014L2YC7O,I LOVE this show. I used to watch it when I was a teenager. It was such a great show. I am so happy to see that Amazon has the full set. This will be my next purchase. Can't afford it right now.,1467504000,,194,3.5348837209302326
7414286,5,B014L2YC7O,Great show and wonderful box set. I think this set of all four seasons was released in 2015. The DVD quality is very nice. Good buy,1467331200,2,131,4.076923076923077

7414290,5,B014L2YC7O,Product is very good & packaging was very good. It arrived later than the due date so will be a little more cautious about using Amazon prime shipping in future. But the series itself is action packed cop show with the fun Sci Fi twist to keep it interesting. If you want a weekend or two of action packed fun & you don't mind suspending your disbelief here & there lol you'll have fun & enjoy the characters.,1461196800,12,409,4.256410256410256

Tried all of the first season DVDs, first three of the second season, then a couple of random discs on each of the third and fourth seasons.  NONE of them would play.

7414317,3,B014L2YC7O,"Every single disc from this entire series makes an insane amount of racket when I put it in my laptop DVD drive. Loud whirring and spinning noises have me fearing that the drive is about to burn out, and it takes quite some time to actually show up as playable. I've tested pretty much every other DVD that I own on my laptop, and it's definitely only this series that has issues. The show will eventually play in perfectly fine quality, but will occasionally freeze or lag for a second if the laptop is moved while the disc is inside. The sounds are even worse when I try to play it on my X-Box 360. I'm not saying don't buy the show, but cross your fingers that you don't get the kind of defective product I did.",1457308800,6,714,4.218978102189781

It's got it's B-movie moments, and Det. Ellison smooches a few ladies, but the friendships are genuine and enjoyable to watch develop, and there's great acting by Garett Maggart and Richard Burgi. Maybe if this show had been released right away the fandom wouldn't have been as prolific with it's fan fiction, but ultimately I'm not complaining and have enjoyed the fan fiction, the sound track, and the waiting has finally culminated in this the DVD set getting released! I can only hope that there are bloopers, behind-the-scenes, and other fun extras to really put a cherry on top of a great buddy-cop-sci-fi show. :)",1441411200,19,794,4.977443609022556

I am confident that Amazon will soon offer discounts on this price.  (check out the comments at the tvshowsondvd.com site pertaining to this exact issue.)  Also, the distributor (Visual Entertainment) is offering it at about half the cost which will no doubt cause the price here to come down.

As for already owning season one, I too have those DVD's, but the ability to own the entire series is enough to get me to buy those few episodes again!  This series had a lot of heart and I'm so excited to see all of the episodes once again!",1441152000,26,683,4.3046875

I'm grateful it's finally available.  For those of us wanting the not-so-mainstream shows, we probably have to expect higher prices.",1441152000,13,436,4.493670886075949

8731183,5,B014L2YC7O,"I only vaguely remember this series from back-in-the-day when it was on television. But it sounded interested like something I would watch. The series is better than I was expecting, still a bit cheesy by today's standards - but watchable. I'm only about one season in and haven't experienced any issues with the DVDs. The case these discs come in is one of those giant multi-disc clamshell cases, which works for me. I like how compact those are and how little room it takes up on my video shelf. I'm happy with the show and my purchase.",1529452800,,538,4.556701030927835
