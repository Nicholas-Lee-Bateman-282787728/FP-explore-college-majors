8537046,5,B0096W13C2,"Just so that everyone is aware - This is NOT the complete series - it only has 19 DVDs. It does not contain the whole story that the TV series covered.

Make sure to get the 31 DVDs set. The Editorial Review is misleading as it is for the whole series, and unfortunately, I did not realise this, and paid the full price thinking I was getting the full serie :(

Otherwise, this is a gem of Hindu story telling that my husband and I enjoy watching and learn from. Thank you for creating such inspirational videos.",1406592000,2,512,4.268041237113402

8537048,4,B0096W13C2,The story of Ram avatar is slow otherwise I m glad they made this as now I m able to understand a lot about Lord Vishnu. Over all learned a lot and Nitish as always did very well in all the roles.,1378425600,2,196,3.6904761904761907
