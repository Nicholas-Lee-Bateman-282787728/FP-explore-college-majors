333824,4,630132854X,"When one thinks of Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda together on the screen, we instantly recall Preston Sturges' ""The Lady Eve"", but often forgotten is the first pairing of Stanwyck and Fonda in the fun RKO screwball-mystery, THE MAD MISS MANTON (1938).

True to the title, Stanwyck is madcap heroine Melsa Manton, a free-spirited Park Avenue socialite who unwittingly stumbles across a dead body that promptly disappears once she alerts the police.  Lieutenant Brent (Sam Levene) won't tolerate the ""fantasies"" of Melsa and her pleas fall on deaf ears - until the missing body is discovered in Brent's rumble seat!  Drawn into Melsa's manic whirlwind is newspaper journalist Peter Ames (Henry Fonda), initially an unwelcome thorn in Melsa's side, but who soon becomes a valuable partner when the bodies start piling up!

Although she hardly convinces as a bubblehead socialite, Stanwyck's performance stands amongst the finest screwball heroines; Henry Fonda likewise is adorable.  A year prior to her breakout ""Gone with the Wind"" success, Hattie McDaniel (billed as ""McDaniels"" in the credits) is Melsa's wisecracking maid; watch out for other enjoyable personalities of the period like Penny Singleton, Olin Howland and Stanley Ridges.

This long-awaited DVD debut from the Warner Archive series will be welcomed by fans.  Print quality is reasonable but unspectacular.",1294704000,2,1373,5.417840375586854
333825,3,630132854X,"Here's the basic idea: a flutter-brained socialite stumbles across a dead body, but it vanishes before the cops can arrive.

 So of course, the socialite does what you'd expect -- she gathers all her equally flutter-brained friends, and tries to solve the murder herself (with the interference of a journalist). ""The Mad Miss Manton"" is a fun, quirky little screwball comedy/mystery with some excellent performances, although the central romance is not quite believable.

On her way home from a costume party, Melsa Manton (Barbara Stanwyck) stumbles across the corpse of a rich banker... but by the time the cops have arrived, the corpse is gone. Unsurprisingly, the cops don't believe her, and soon the Morning Clarion is denouncing Melsa and all her socialite buddies. Outraged by this, Melsa decides to sue the paper's editor Peter Ames (Henry Fonda) for libel.

And she gathers all her various friends to help her find the missing corpse and uncover the murderer's identity -- but as they sleuth around, they soon discover that Ames is also doing some detective work as well. The problem is, the closer that Melsa gets to the murderer, the more dangerous it becomes for her.

""The Mad Miss Manton"" is about the frothiest, screwballiest murder mystery you could even imagine. A large portion of the story involves a bunch of rather flaky rich girls stumbling around various luxurious houses, searching for evidence and occasionally tying up Peter Ames. Ah, fun stuff.

Yeah, there is plenty of criminal meat and a few choice suspects, as well as a rather well-written tangle of clues and misplaced bodies. But most of the entertainment comes from the clever dialogue (""If the upstairs has to be searched, we'll search it together."" ""Why, that's communism!"") and finely-honed sense of comedy (Fonda's ""death"" scene in the hospital).

I've never really been able to accept Barbara Stanwyck as a bubblebrain, to be honest. But she does  a brilliant and very funny job as the flaky, funny Melsa, and she has excellent chemistry with Fonda. The one problem is that their relationship is hinted to be serious enough to make them talk about marriage, but there's virtually no trust in their relationship -- he's always trying to trick her.

""The Mad Miss Manton"" is a big mass of fluffy cotton candy -- but between Fonda, Standwyck and the amusing dialogue, it's a fun way to spend a rainy day.",1281312000,3,2391,4.942643391521197
333826,5,630132854X,"This has long been a favorite classic comedy of mine and for years all I had was a taped version from the TV. It is a good thing that is finally available, but I think it deserves better treatment than DVD-R.

Other reviewers have thoroughly covered the storyline. I just want to add that I think Henry Fonda is at his best here in a role that shows him as strong, yet vulnerable. Barbara Stanwyck is flighty, yet smart and they have great chemistry together. If you haven't seen them together in ""The Lady Eve,"" you have a delightful treat in store. Both of these movies of theirs are classic examples of true entertainment.

Be advised that the manufacturer recommends that this DVD-R type media be played in DVD players only, so if you have a DVD player/recorder you may have trouble with it.",1279324800,5,795,4.513888888888889

333828,4,630132854X,"What has THE THIN MAN wrought? True, other madcap mysteries had arrived to cinema before Nick & Nora Charles's oh so memorable debut, but it was THE THIN MAN series which propelled this sub-genre into prominence. Anyway, THE MAD MISS MANTON came along in 1938, and was one of the better variations on the theme. It paired Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda for their first of three films, with THE MAD MISS MANTON considered by many as a sort of dress rehearsal for their later screwball classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lady-Eve-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005JH9B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lady Eve - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;(the third film they co-starred in is YOU BELONG TO ME).

The plot: Late one night, while walking her dog, Park Avenue heiress Melsa Manton espies a corpse. The police arrive in ten minutes, but in the interim the corpse vanishes. Thing is, Melsa and her flighty high society gal pals had garnered a reputation around the city as prankish merry makers (all for the cause of charity, the girls declare), and now the police believe that this is only the latest antic being pulled by Melsa. A newspaper editor sends out a blistering editorial condemning Miss Manton and accusing her of a murder hoax. In the face of the police's naked disbelief and the newspaper's disregard, Melsa Manton takes it upon herself to unearth the corpse and solve the murder mystery. Never mind that she's promptly threatened with an anonymous note and a knife on her door. Oh, and she also sues the paper for libel.

Rumor has it that Henry Fonda didn't care at all for his part, but he turns in a professional performance anyway. This film is more a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck, an actress who really could do it all. Except that Stanwyck is such a ferocious and intelligent actress that even her version of the screwball dizzy dame can't help but demonstrate smarts and a sense of solidity. Fonda, on the other hand, loses some man cred by getting beaten and tied up by eight lovely society debs. THE MAD MISS MANTON is breezy and farcical and sets a very brisk pace. Things are hopping in this film. Even the mystery is staged so that it doesn't feel like a throwaway plot device. And perhaps the reason Fonda so detested his newspaper editor role is because of his character's churlish behavior with the fair sex. He tells Stanwyck's character: ""You are a nasty creature, aren't you? But in time I'll beat it out of you."" And later on: ""Go away! You bother me!"" His comments tend to come off as more mean than the police lieutenant's terse ""Shaddup!"" Still, it's Henry Fonda whom Stanwyck ends up with, so go figure. But I really prefer their chemistry in THE LADY EVE.

For fans of GONE WITH THE WIND, Hattie McDaniels appears as Melsa Manton's uppity servant and she delivers several good one-liners. Sam Levene has his moments as the often irritated, pill-popping (for his ailing stomach), much put-upon police lieutenant. THE MAD MISS MANTON is also a mini-study in how to stage group shots as, for a huge chunk of the picture, Miss Manton is surrounded by her bevy of belles, all of them stunners and dressed up to the nines and in the latest trends of the late '30s. I guess you can try to differentiate among the seven debs, but none of them really stand out. I did like one politically-minded girl's (I forget which one) running exchange. She seems to think that every suggested group activity is tantamount to a communist act. There's one scene in which the girls come upon the killer holding a gun to Melsa's head:

- one girl states: ""If you kill her, you'll have to kill all of us.""
- You know who: ""Oh, you're always talking communism!""",1249084800,8,3720,4.853543307086614
333829,4,630132854X,"Barbara Stanwyck plays the rich socialite Miss Manton who discovers a murdered man one night in a deserted building, and Henry Fonda is the newspaperman who doesn't believe her at first but then falls in love with her; together they capture the killer. Not as great as other screwball comedies from this period, and rather silly in spots, yet the script does offer up a number of funny lines. The plot isn't unique by any means (Hitchcock plowed a deep furrow in the unbelieving-couple-who-succumb-to-love field), but Stanwyck and Fonda give it their professional all and the result is a decent enough comedy.",1188432000,2,609,4.980392156862745
333830,5,630132854X,"This is a wonderful screwball comedy that stars Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda.  They showed that they had a nack for comedy as well as drama which really up to this time, that's all they had done.  The film starts out with Melson Manson coming home to her 5th Ave highrise after a costume charity ball to walk her dogs at 3am.  While she's tending to one little dog, she see's her high society friend Ronny leaving the Lane Mansion.  She goes into the mansion that's been closed up for awhile only to discover a dead body.  She calls for the police and when they get there the body is missing and the police figure it's just another one of her tricks.  A sociaty dame that had too much time on her hands.  She gets a very unkind write up in the paper by the editor Peter (Fonda) and takes an instant dislike to him.  He on the other hand takes an instant liking to her.  She gathers her group of sociaty girl debutants (A bunch of unknown starletts that never did another thing in movies, except Penny Singleton who went on to be Blondie in the Blondie series) to investigate the murder in the Lane Mansion.  As they are going around the crime scene, Peter joins them.  They tie him up and leave him there to go on to Ronnie's place so he can explain why he was at the mansion.  Well, the group finds another dead body that the police once again thinks is a hoax, so they leave the body on Peter's office couch.  This time the police round the girls up in the middle of the night to question them. (this is a funny scene the way the police are questioning them.)  Peter helps the girls get out of the questioning only to put them back in the hand of police once more.  As they were leaving the station, the police put two of the girls in the rumble seat of a car, where one of the debs discovers the body of Mr Lane.  Melsa and Peter keep going back and fourth with the I love you, I hate you routine. The girls continue to investigate the murders.  They are so good at investigating that they give one of the suspects an alibi and leave the police at square one again.  But did they give the wrong man the alibi and leave a killer on the loose to kill again?  I'm lucky enough to have taped it off of AMC when AMC was actually good.  Before they changed the format and really cared about movies like this one.  Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck are so good together.  They made three movies all told.  The Lady Eve was another one that is a screwball comedy where Barbara Stanwyck demanded and got Henry for her leading man.  She knew how well they worked together.  Hattie McDaniel once again plays a maid, but a maid you love.  She is strong in her role and is just as much a screen presence as the two stars. She also gets some of the funniest lines in the movie.  One note about the women who play the Debutantes.  One woman billed herself as Vicki Lester, I guess trying to bring herself luck.  You might remember a year before this movie, Vicki Lester was the character from A Star Is Born.  The movie keeps moving and I don't recall a dull moment in it.  Also you don't know who done it until the end of the film.  Good chemistry, a good script, don't let this one pass you up.  Oh Yeh, the fashions are great to see too.",1131926400,28,3231,4.201626016260162
333831,5,630132854X,"I, too, disagree with scotsladdie - this movie is an absolute gem, and I've been hoping for several years to see this one come out on DVD!  This is one of my favorite B&W comedies, with an enchantingly headstrong heroine and her equally (and charmingly) stubborn suitor.  And, oh, yes - it's a mystery, too.  I must say, I greatly prefer it to movies such as Bringing Up Baby (much as I like Cary Grant and K. Hepburn), in which the so-called hero is too muddled to attempt to hold his ground against a female as featherheaded as himself.

You know, I heard somewhere that Mad Miss Manton was the first ""screwball comedy"" to use regular actors/actresses instead of those that specialized in comic performance.  If so, it was an absolute stroke of genius!  Should you have an appreciation for quick wit and the eternal battle of the sexes, might I recommend Mad Miss Manton?",1117929600,22,873,4.6

Miscast, Barbara Stanwyck plays a dizzy debutante who's one of a covey of Junior League girls in fox capes; she walks her dog at three in the morning after a costume ball, and encounters a corpse in a deserted house. Inspired by the spectacle, she immediately corrals her flighty friends - in their best party dresses - and they scurry around the scene of the crime, looking for clues and squealing much of the time...A great example of the kind of idiotic films which helped kill the screwball genre.

Her serious dramas had pretty much placed her there in my mind.  So, to go back and see one of her earlier and even comedic performances was something really interesting.  Besides, the character in this one plays out more convincing to me than in ""Fire.""  Here, she is playing a loose cannon who misfires more often than not, with a gaggle of groupies behind her.  It was both fun and fascinating to see her like this.  The film and Ms. Stanwyck's character actually reminded me of the Nancy Drew films with Bonita Granville - the same hyper youthful intensity, creeping around dark rooms at night and all of that.  Another comparison also came to mind - Lana Turner's early youthful portrayal in  ""Slightly Dangerous,"" of all things.  Both actresses became known for entirely different types of roles, but both were really, really enjoyable in these two early wild and wacky films.  There's definitely a distinctive flair for comedy in both cases.

333880,4,630132854X,"Purchased on the heels of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lady-Eve/dp/B00005JH9B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lady Eve</a>' - an absolutely outstanding light romantic comedy with Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck. That this film stars the same artists, I had hoped that particular lightning-in-a-bottle would be recaptured. (although technically this was their first pairing of three films - with 'Eve' their second go around)

While I'm not disappointed, it would be fair to say that this fell short of that high watermark. Obviously, what was missing in 'Mad' was the guiding hand of master director Preston Sturges to steer the material into rich waters. Without him at the helm, this production wasn't as sharp. Mind you, this is still a very enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, 'Eve' spoiled me. <g>

In 'Mad' the subject of the movie's title is Ms. Melsa Manton - wealthy young socialite, vivacious bon vivant and all-around troublemaker. She's the alpha amongst her pack of carefree girls; making mischief and having fun, usually one leading to the other.

As the story unfolds, Melsa accidentally stumbles upon a crime scene - a dead body in the vacant home of a family she knows. Terrified, she immediately runs to a police callbox for help. But the arriving officers are less than enthused when they recognize the caller. Having been waylaid by Ms. Manton's previous madcap escapades, they're not interested in playing any games. In fact, the coppers are deciding whether or not to just haul her to jail for a night and maybe teach her a lesson.

But she insists, not a block away, a murdered corpse. So despite their suspicions, which includes standing around at three in the morning with Melsa dressed as Little Miss Muffet, they go to the alleged scene of the crime.

No body.

The only person not seriously ticked off - Melsa, who is stunned beyond words. The cops however are not amused. Suddenly, it looks like a night in jail may turn into a real stint in the big house for false reporting of a crime. Again.

Step-in newspaper ace reporter Peter Ames. And like the police, he's had it with these trust fund babies tearing up the town. Going on the offensive, he puts them on notice: No more free rides. All the mayhem and destruction they cause will be duly reported to the public. He's going to put an end to their self-indulgent adventures once and for all. And his most vile contempt is for their pack leader.

Until he actually meets her.

Despite his initial desire to publicly excoriate Melsa and her gang of fellow silver spooners, he can't humiliate her anymore. Love will do that. Plus, the death threats she received are real, so too the assassination attempt on her life - during which Peter himself takes a bullet. So despite all his previous sanctimony, he has to do whatever he can to prevent his would-be-wife from becoming the next victim. Even if that means he has to become her worst enemy by shadowing her every move and turning stool pigeon at every opportunity.

But this is Ms. Melsa Manton, she's no timid flower in distress. Despite the dangers, she's plunging head-on to solve the case. No matter what the cost.

Again, very enjoyable with many laughs and, of course, that wonderful on-screen chemistry of Fonda and Stanwyck.

Movie Note:

- Notably, this was filmed during the height of the Great Depression. And it's very difficult to imagine today, but back then audiences loved watching movies about the &uuml;ber wealthy 1%. Lives without any care or worry in the world, free from the horrible reality of brutal work, cold furnaces, bread lines and soup kitchens. Sounds bizarre but that was true back then, and tons of films from this period catered to this odd kind of escapism.

Personal Notes:

- Mentioned previously, this film is the first of three pairings Henry and Missy did together. Next up for me, from 1941, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Belong-to-Me/dp/B004TTOQQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Belong to Me</a>"". And I honestly cannot wait.

- Am a monster fan of character actor Sam Levene. During the 1930's, he was often cast as the beleaguered police officer whose constant irritants were three-fold in every movie: 1) Having to correct people about his rank, which was always Lieutenant. 2) Repeatedly berating his junior officers to stop dillydallying or removing themselves from his personal space. 3) Being the butt of much sarcasm, whereupon Sam would produce his famously hilarious double-take.

Where are character actors like that today? So sad that everyone wants to be the lead. Sad for them and sad for us, the audience as we're deprived the likes of Walter Brennan, Elisha Cook Jr., and Eugene Pallette of the silver screen. Although, admittedly, Stephen Root does seem to filling in nicely. But we need more of them.",1347062400,,4881,5.0964912280701755
333881,3,630132854X,"The 1938 THE MAD MISS MANTON is the sort of movie that turns up in the middle of the night on your favorite old-movie-channel, a film with noted actors and an interesting-sounding story, but no life and no script.

A sort of low-rent take on THE THIN MAN, the story finds wealthy socialite Melsa Manton (Barbara Stanwyck) stumbling across a body in a for-sale house--but when she calls the police nothing is there. The following morning newspaper man Peter Ames (Henry Fonda) runs a story about the whole thing, showing his disdain for wealthy pranksters and holding Melsa and her entire class up to ridicule. In response, Melsa gathers her socialite friends and they begin to investigate the crime for themselves, showing up both Peter and police (in the form of Sam Levene, who frequently played in Thin Man films) in the process.

Barbara Stanwyck is hideously miscast as the clever-but-silly Melsa: she was certainly clever, but Stanwyck was never silly, and she shifts awkwardly between the two. Peter Fonda is surprisingly wooden, Melsa's debutant friends are not greatly memorable, and although Levene gives his usual good turn, the only one who comes out of the show with flowers is Hattie McDaniel, who plays Melsa's irrascable and (according to the other characters) frequently ""fried"" housekeeper. The script is an uncomfortable affair, filled with one-lines that don't really work, and convolutions that make it extremely difficult to follow the plot; by the time you find out whodunit you're not sure if you can recall the character from earlier scenes.

Everyone certainly gives it their best, and it is a mildly amusing throw away, a chance to see Stanwyck and Fonda before they were more memorably teamed in THE LADY EVE, and certainly Hattie McDaniel makes it worth the effort. But it's very much a case of ""Don't Expect Too Much And You Might Like It.""

7812505,5,630132854X,"I saw this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago on an over the air movie channel. I thought it was absolutely hilarious. I recorded it on the DVR, but every so often, these devices lose all of their content, and I am told buy the cable company that they don't know why it happens. I am on my third DVR. I did not want to take a chance on it being lost, so I purchased it. Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck made a great team, and the whole cast was worked wonderfully together.",1505865600,,485,4.010309278350515

7812511,4,630132854X,"I am a huge Stanwyck fan and this is a good story and mystery, especially when the cast includes Henry Fonda.  They only did one other picture together that I know of, The Lady Eve, which is by far a better picture.  I think The Mad Miss Manton was done much earlier and the 30's had a different style. Barbara is the head of a group of high society girl friends (Dizzy, Park Avenue Dames), who get involved in a murder mystery to clear their friend's name. The period costumes and dialogue alone, are worth the price of this movie.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Miss Stanwyck; she is a terrific actress and can do both comedy and drama with equal talent.  Comedy is much harder to pull off but most of her movies are worth collecting and viewing more than once.  They don't write plots like this anymore, screwball comedies.",1482883200,,839,4.422077922077922
