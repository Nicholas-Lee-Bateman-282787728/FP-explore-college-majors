8654323,1,B00JWZCM8C,"As a believer in our Lord Jesus Christ, a believer that we are in the 'last days', and a believer in Billy Crone as a competent Bible teacher, I'm embarrassed to have to give this a one-star rating. Please allow me to explain.

Pastor Crone's book of the same name is a good read; it's the watching (or better yet 'attempting to watch') the video that stopped me in my tracks. May I preface my next statement with this: I've seen Pastor Billy Crone in an interview on ""Prophecy in the News"" with Gary Stearman several times and have thoroughly enjoyed the interview and Billy's extensive knowledge of this particular study topic. Now for the 'one-star': I made it through four DVD's in the 20+ set; barely. As I said, this is a difficult review for me to write, but after paying such a hefty price, I feel that I must speak out to others who just may encounter the same annoyance with the countless idiosyncrasies displayed by Pastor Crone and the constant review of each previous disk on each disk (if that statement makes sense). The footage of current events is excellent; to the point that I will once again attempt to watch the entire series simply because the 'news clips' are so well put together, at least in the three disks that I've viewed so far.

Once again I must apologize for writing such a negative review, however, it has been written in all honesty. Just maybe he will see this review; and if he does; please, Pastor Crone, with all due respect, watch yourself and your presentations closely; I believe you'll see what I mean. You have so much good information to present. Maybe have someone close to you analyze and critique your speech patterns, someone who will be honest and forthright.

God be with youi!",1501286400,2,1727,4.58252427184466
8654324,4,B00JWZCM8C,These sermons about the end times are very good. Until you get to the last 3 or 4. There is a lot of speculation as to what they are saying. The fact that they haven't happened yet makes it more guess then fact. The first ones are very good and recap a lot of what has happened. They are good to watch.,1474848000,2,302,3.8870967741935485
8654325,5,B00JWZCM8C,"The Final Countdown tells you about what the Bible teaches on the Second Coming of Jesus Christ,  along with many news clips, and a born again pastor to put it all together on DVDs.  I have watched all of them, and now want to rewatch and take notes in a notebook, so that I can refer back to it quickly.  Very good information all put together for you in one set of DVD's.  Well worth the cost!  I assure you that you will learn things that you did not know.",1420416000,8,459,4.055555555555555
