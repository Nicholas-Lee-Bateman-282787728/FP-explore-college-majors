8729181,2,B013Y6L5RI,"I'm conflicted. I adore A Boy Named Charlie Brown, and Snoopy Come Home- which is why I was thrilled and preordered the film as soon as I saw it appear on Bluray. But this is as lazy as it gets. No extras, no languages, not even subtitles in this release. It's simply both films slapped onto a disc. This is a completely unceremonious foray into the HD format for these wonderful films. While ABNCB is cropped into 16:9 from it's original 4:3 aspect ratio (noticable in the ""i before e"" song number that cuts off some of the words) the natural film grain and look of the film looks quite crisp, despite also being mildy stretched to fill the frame. Snoopy come home suffers less of these issues, although it is still cropped.

It's a shame since this may very well be the last time this film gets any attention at all, and I highly doubt they'd go through the trouble of remastering a true, uncropped version of ABNCB and SCH. I still recommend getting it if you want a hard copy of the two films in HD. But it's clear from the moment you put in the disc that they deserved better than this.",1447977600,11,1091,4.321951219512195
