1711551,5,B00006673Y,"Imagine spending a quiet evening with Wynonna and some of her friends ...with Venice, Italy as a backdrop. This is a side of Wynonna we don't often get to see. The Queen of Attitude shares her music, - from her CD New Day Dawning - her laughter, her tears, hopes , disappointments, and her love for Italy with great interviews. No concert halls here, just Wy with Vicki, Robert and Kim singing in intimate outdoor settings in Venice and a cathedral in Bologna . How Great Thou Art has never been greater !",1029888000,6,505,4.440860215053763

Especially the a capella song she and her group performed in the Church/Chapel was amazing.  A must have for every Wynonna fan.",1308096000,,496,7.131147540983607
7961818,5,B00006673Y,"I pulled this dvd out today and it's just Wynonna at her very best. With Kim, Vicki and bob they really show was singing is all about. I am sure all die hard wy fans know this, but if your just a passing fan pick this dvd up and I think you will like what you see and hear.",1238284800,,273,3.6440677966101696
7961819,5,B00006673Y,"Very out-of-the-box performance for Wynonna, well done and very impressive.  Wynonna is so personable and spiritual, I just love her talent and perspective.",1221955200,,156,5.782608695652174
7961820,4,B00006673Y,"Having been somewhat...bored by Wynonna since Don Potter ceased being her main musical director - especially after seeing her live - I was all set to purchase this DVD for my Wife for her birthday, and just sort of ""leave the room"" or something when it was on.  W-R-O-N-G!!!  This truly IS ""Wynonna Unplugged,"" and with Italy as a backdrop - whew, the DVD is one of the few DVD's that've held my interest all-the-way-thru since..um...""the Criterion refurbishing of 'Gimme Shelter',"" or something.  Just Wy, two acoustic guitarists and an acoustic bassist (and Thank The Lord for her singers, Robert & Vicky!!!).  Yes, I could have lived w/o her weepy moments where she...""reflects"" on recent events, but the music - WOW.  INCREDIBLE.  And BTW, we also have that ""Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert (1992)"" DVD, and we were wondering who this singer, Zucchero, was - he's on here, evidentally, an opera singer of some sort (!), and just to see/hear him ""jam"" with Wy & her band on the-best-song-of-her-third-solo-CD, ""Somebody To Love You,"" is itself worth the price of the DVD.  Yes, I freely admit that I liked Wy much MUCH  better before Her Mama got sick and Wy started singing (ulp) ""adult contemporary,"" but ""Wynonna Live In Venice"" is incredible.  No slick production, no ""stings,"" just Wy and her singers and band - unplugged.  You can't ask for much more.  OH, and their version of ""How Great Thou Art,"" sung/performed in a chapel or monastery or something made me want to disclaim every snide comment I've ever made about (sic) ""Contemporary"" Christian music, too.",1176854400,,1570,4.909090909090909
7961821,5,B00006673Y,"A moving compilation of ""Country Music"" sung by Wynonna &

band in the romantic beauty of Venice,Italy.

  A religious woman,Wynonna was unable to visit the ""Holy Land""

due to war. Instead she felt

she was directed to Italy,a place her late grandfather prophetically told her,she would someday visit and sing.

She reflects on on many memories while visiting a 700 year

old Church. Her rendition in the Church,of ""How Great Though Art"",is both mystical and moving.

  Wynonna stated her singing brought her close to God in Italy.

Even if you are not a ""Country &Western Fan ,the scenery

combined with all the music will lift your soul.",1151452800,,640,4.869158878504673
7961822,5,B00006673Y,"Great movie! I recommend this to any Wynonna fan. Its just her,Kim, Vicki, Robert and 2 guitarist. All of the music is sung outdoors In Italy. All of the songs are great, but I love No One Else On Earth, Only Love, and How Great Thou Art. Her voice is just amazing.",1139443200,,265,4.115384615384615
7961823,3,B00006673Y,"Although the title is a little misleading (it's not a live concert as the title might suggest), the music is just wonderful.  Wynonna sings many of her hits with just acoustic guitar accompaniment, and her rich, full, soulful voice is beautifully highlighted in each song.  I wish there were more songs on this DVD, but for the price, this DVD certainly gives good value to any serious Wynonna fan.  And the footage of rural Italy is just lovely.",1114473600,6,446,4.6923076923076925
7961824,4,B00006673Y,"I do like Wynonna, really I do, but the other Music In High Places (MIHP) series has a level of interaction with the venue that I found lacking in this edition. There wasn't much in the way of shopping or the culture or the interaction with the locals that I find so attractive about this series. She did have a duet (of sorts) with a local musician but that's really as far as this goes. MIHP is a music travel adventure series and while this has music and travel, this particular episode is lacking in the adventure department. The Goo Goo Dolls mudsliding and playing on a Glacier was adventure. Collective Soul on camels was adventure. Unwritten Law in a Rodeo Arena with cattle and horses running rings was adventure. Sugar Ray hopping around molten lava in Hawaii was adventure. This one, if not for the music (Wynnona is always good) doesn't have much travel adventure to it. Italy is beautiful, but it's not a ""High Place"" in this series.",1108857600,,946,4.570588235294117
7961825,5,B00006673Y,"I was living in Venice in the Fall of 2000 when this was shot, and a big part of it (""Going Nowhere,"" et. al.) was filmed just outside my back door. Wynonna is just as amazing and graceful in person as she is on screen, and this DVD is a must have, not only for Wynonna fans, but for country, gospel, and blues fans in general. The music is gorgeous, and the scenery is amazing; Venice is the most beautiful city in the world. Definitely buy it.",1093046400,9,445,4.126436781609195
