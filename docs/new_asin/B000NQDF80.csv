Then there is shooting in the dark! Men ride away from the saloon.

Can they stop the range war by putting the Circle D men in jail? The Circle D men plan to kill the sheepherders, even the lady boss. The sheepherders shoot back. The three lawmen stop the battle. The Circle D men have no right to attack the sheepherders because a cattle man was killed; they are arrested. There is comedy when Panhandle the tinker meets twins, who sing a song.

The Sheriff releases the Circle D men so they can defend themselves. There is shooting. Dave, Tex, and the others arrive to stop the Taylor gang. Peace will return to the valley. Tex sings to Miss Ruth. Panhandle falls into his trick [for a comic ending].
