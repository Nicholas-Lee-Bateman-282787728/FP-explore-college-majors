8184847,4,B000OFOLOC,Always enjoy watching Lidia.  This DVD would have been even better if the three were combined on one disc.,1475971200,,106,4.578947368421052
8184848,5,B000OFOLOC,"Lydia is an amazing chef!  I'll take her anyway I can get her!  I'm half Italian but my mother never let me cook with her, nor did she teach me.  I am self-taught.  I just LOVE Lydia!  She is so talented and kind and helpful to her students.
You cannot go wrong buying her helpful CDs.",1344643200,3,285,4.017857142857143
8184849,5,B000OFOLOC,"I love all of Lidia's Italian cooking shows.  She is a very good teacher and explains things clearly.  I've tried many of her recipes and they are wonderful.  I also like the style of her presentation -- organized and calm, but with plenty of explanations and interesting points.  She often has guests, whether other chefs or family.  People on Lidia's shows feel comfortable being there, and it makes me feel comfortable watching the show and learning.  I really detest the Food Network shows -- I don't need someone shouting ""Bam!"" at me or having flashy camerawork to be entertained.  I'm a cook and I'm not watching these shows to get some sort of adrenaline rush.  Lidia's style is more Zen-like and focuses on an understanding of the creative process in cooking, which is my personal preference in a cooking show.
The one complaint I have about this particular series is that it is very expensive.  It would be nice if it were more affordable.",1191196800,18,949,4.737804878048781
