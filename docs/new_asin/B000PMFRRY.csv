2826454,4,B000PMFRRY,"Yes, this is Home Run Derby as it was meant to be.  The best match-up was Harmon Killebwew vs. Mickey Mantle.  The other match-ups were great also. Most of these players are in the Baseball Hall of Fame. I remember watching these as a kid and I enjoyed them immensely.  A few years ago ESPN re-played some of the match-ups.  It takes you back to the Golden Age of Baseball, when Baseball was America's pasttime.  Enjoy!!!",1186963200,,421,4.4868421052631575
2826455,5,B000PMFRRY,"Brass tacks. It's an archaic term, dating back to when wall-to-wall
floor coverings had to be replaced because the used areas had been worn away to the brass tacks that held them down, giving a visual indication that it was time to go to work. Home Run Derby was literally such a show.
Filmed at Wrigley field in Los Angeles with no crowd of spectators, there
were three umpires, three minor league outfielders, a catcher, a batting
practice pitcher, two Major League sluggers and host Mark Scott in attendance to determine who could hit more pitches over the equidistant
walls of the park. The lack of an audience adds to the business-like
atmosphere of the proceedings, as does Scott's old-school generic announcing style. Watch an episode after ESPN's bombastic annual All-Star
presentation with resident windbag Chris Berman and shed a quiet tear for
the passing of subtlety in baseball. I won't tell you who wins the competition, but, if you're more than a weekend fan, you probably already know. Worth the time and money.",1185753600,5,1027,4.908045977011494
2826456,5,B000PMFRRY,"Home Run Derby was a 1959-1960 television show where the top longball hitters of that era would compete in head-to-head contests for cash prizes.  The rules were similar to today's Home Run Derbys at the All-Star Game.  In fact, nine future Hall-of-Famers, including Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Harmon Killebrew and Mickey Mantle would be featured on the show.  Tragically, the show's host, Mark Scott, died of a heart attack in 1960 and the show was then cancelled.

I don't know what kind of ratings the program got while it aired, but it's a pretty bland black-and-white show compared to today's TV.  I bought it because I love the old flannel uniforms and old neighborhood ballparks (the show was filmed at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, what was home to the minor-league LA Angels and Hollywod Stars and the first home of the Major League LA Angels).  But it occured to me that EVERY SINGLE HOME RUN IS FREE OF STEROIDS, HGH, ANDRO OR ANY OTHER SUBSTANCES.  Suddenly, this makes a very unspectacular program pretty spectacular.

And of course, it's great to watch Mickey Mantle at a time when his drinking and carousing were kept out of the media spotlight, and a young Hank Aaron, long before he and his home run record were the targets of racist bigots.

Home Run Derby is a great program, and two more volumes are due out summer 2007.  A lot of fun to watch!",1185235200,7,1362,4.6375
2826457,5,B000PMFRRY,"""Home Run Derby"", a rarely-seen television show which had a short-lived original run from 1959 to 1961, has been on my ""DVD Wish List"" for several years. I never thought I'd ever be able to scratch this show off of that list.

But lo and behold, on July 10, 2007, MGM Home Entertainment (in conjunction with 20th Century Fox's distribution) released the first of three ""Home Run Derby"" volumes. What a pleasure it is, indeed, to be able to watch these great old baseball shows once again.

Hosted by Mark Scott, each episode of ""Derby"" is a half-hour, nine-inning home-run hitting contest, staged at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles (which was, at the time of filming, a minor-league ballpark; but it soon became the home of the American League Los Angeles Angels, when the league expanded in 1961).

Many of the top sluggers from both the N.L. and A.L. competed in the televised ""Home Run Derby"" contests, including perennial All-Stars like Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, and Duke Snider.

The winner of each week's ""Derby"" received $2,000 for his victory and would be invited to come back the next week to swing for the fences against another big-league opponent.

Some of the ""at the desk"" chats that Mark Scott has with the players are a bit stiff and awkward, especially some of the small talk with Willie Mays, who has always resembled living cardboard whenever he finds himself in front of a movie or TV camera. But, man, that guy could sure hit a baseball! ~wink~

But I don't really care about the stiffness of the conversations on the sidelines, because it's still great fun just to see (and hear) these legends of the game in their prime....forever frozen in the late 1950s and very early 1960s on DVD.

And Scott's play-by-play is a bit redundant at times, including the very similar way he calls many of the ""Derby"" home runs (see the title of my review for an example). But this, too, doesn't matter to me, because Scott is a very likeable and affable announcer/host, and that comes across on screen as well, in my opinion.

On a very sad note, Mark Scott died of a heart attack in July 1960 (at the age of only 45), and the ""Home Run Derby"" series was not continued beyond the first 26 episodes (all of which are being released on DVD by MGM in Summer 2007, spanning three volumes).

This first volume of ""Home Run Derby"" consists of the first 8 fence-pounding episodes of the series, while&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-2/dp/B000RZS5VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volume 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-3/dp/B000RPCK0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volume 3</a>&nbsp;contain 9 programs apiece.

Here's a list of all the players who make at least one ""Derby"" appearance during the course of the 26-episode TV series:

Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Frank Robinson, Ernie Banks, Gil Hodges, Eddie Mathews, Duke Snider, Al Kaline, Jackie Jensen, Rocky Colavito, Harmon Killebrew, Ken Boyer, Bob Cerv, Wally Post, Dick Stuart, Bob Allison, Gus Triandos, and Jim Lemon.

SOME WRIGLEY FIELD TRIVIA:

During the one and only season when Major League Baseball was played at Los Angeles' Wrigley Field (in 1961, when Wrigley was home to the Los Angeles Angels), a big-league record was set there when 248 home runs (more than three per game on the average) were swatted by American League batters, who just loved the short, reachable power alleys (which measured only 345 feet in both left-center and right-center).

So, as evidenced by those 1961 numbers, it's fairly obvious that Wrigley Field in L.A. (not to be confused with the famous ivy-covered ballpark of the same name in Chicago) was ideally suited for ""Home Run Derby"".

The California version of Wrigley Field, which hosted its first baseball game in September 1925, was never occupied by another pro team after the 1961 season and was torn down in 1966.

DVD STATS:

Single-sided, dual-layered disc.

Total running time of this DVD is 193 minutes (the specification grid on the DVD package is incorrect; it shows 240 minutes). Each episode lasts just a tad more than 24 minutes (see the detailed figures provided later in this review).

The originally-aired Gillette commercials are not included on the DVD (which is a bit unfortunate, because some of those old 1959 TV ads would have been nice to see too).

Chapter breaks have been inserted, but not for every inning (or half inning). The chapter stops are random and occur about once every five minutes during each program. There are 6 total ""chapters"" per show, including a separate one for the ending credits.

Video is Black-and-White (Full-Frame; Original TV Ratio; 1.33:1). The picture quality is quite good too.

Audio is in English only (via Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono).

Subtitles have been provided in English, Spanish, and French.

Menus are simple, silent, and static. The Main Menu provides instant access to any of the eight programs on the disc. The only Sub-Menu is for ""Language Selection"".

A ""Play All"" option is available (the Main Menu defaults to this choice each time the disc is loaded).

Bonus Features -- None.

Packaging -- Standard type of plastic ""Keep Case"". Plus, a cardboard slipcover (slipcase) is also included, which slides over the plastic case. The slipcover's artwork, which features a picture of Mickey Mantle swinging for the fences on the front, is identical to the artwork on the inner keep case, except that the photo of Mantle on the outer slipcase has a glossy 3D kind of effect added to it. A pretty nifty little effect too.

-------------------------

THE EPISODES:

Here are the eight match-ups that can be found on ""Home Run Derby: Volume One"" (with the exact length of each program included):

1.) Mickey Mantle vs. Willie Mays (24:04)
2.) Ernie Banks vs. Mickey Mantle (24:09)
3.) Jackie Jensen vs. Mickey Mantle (24:12)

A FINAL WORD:

There's no better way to remember the golden baseball age of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mantle/dp/1584795476/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mantle</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mays/dp/0313334013/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mays</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aaron/dp/1892129051/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aaron</a>&nbsp;(and many other stars of that era) than by watching this DVD.

You get to see the ""true"" home run hitters, such as Mantle, Aaron, Wagner...and the list goes on.  For any true baseball fan this gives you the chance to relive the good ole' days of baseball, and watch home runs hit in classic Wrigley Field.  This is nothing like the home run derby of today at the All Star Game, it's better.",1180224000,8,423,4.197530864197531
2826471,5,B000PMFRRY,"Mantle is really the star of this set, though Killebrew is not exactly a *supporting* star.

this Reviewer has never ascertained the actual shooting dates and that would be facsinating for a mantle fan. It appears that it's business as usual for The Mick, dominating the scene, but another scenario could be at work (at play): these shows were filmed during his only down period in his prime years, 1959 and 1960. Mantle had a good start in '59 but unexpectedly had a terrible second half; conversely, the next season, he had a terrible start...but a great finish (just 3 votes shy of this third MVP). One wonders what he might have accomplished on this show if it was made a few years before or after the presumptive 1959/1960 time.

The above summation really hits home, as the grace and quietude of the players and the times, are wonderfully reflected in the side conversations with the sluggers.

For the unititiated, it should be pointed out that all hitters are right-handed (MM fans should know this, as he was the ultinate switch-hitter and his right-handed stance and style was much different).

Further interest (and fun) is found in watching a guy like Harmon Killebrew, in his Senators uniform; a guy like Ernie banks, who, at the time, would be seen by the nation only as an ""All-Star"". (Despite two consecutive MVP years).

Players: Mantle, Killebrew, Mays, Jensen, Colavito, Banks, Ken Boyer, Hank Aaron.

Note: watch Aaron dominate the scene - he would go on to be the all-time Homer Run Derby Champion. He once said, a major impetus to win was to build an extension onto his Father's house: 15,000 dollars!

2826475,4,B000PMFRRY,"This is a review for Home Run Derby Volume 1, a syndicated series of
half hour tv shows pitting one slugger from the Amercan League against
one from the National League.

The only thing that counts is a ball that's hit over the outfield fence,
every other hit ball and pitch judged to be over the plate is an out.
The folks at ZIV syndication television filmed and marketed this
short-lived series, much the same way they did The Cisco Kid.

While one slugger was at bat, we hear his opponenet talk about his at bat
and hitting in general with the host of the series, Mark Scott, who generally
does a good job especialy when the occasional younger slugger just can't
think of something to say.

These shows were filmed at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles in the fall of 1959.
LA's Wrigley Field was  a small ball park and sonewhat slightly resembled the more
famous Wrigley Field in Chicago.  By the way, this Wrigley Field was used in  more
than a few Hollywood productions and finally met with the wrecking ball in 1966.

In each nine inning show the winner recieves two thousand dollars and the
loser gets five hundred dollars.  Volume One contains the first eight episodes
of Home Run Derby and features Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Harmon Killebrew--
of the Washington Senators--Ernie Banks and Jackie Jenson.

Home Run Derby is a nice, low key approach to big league home run hitting,
all the shows are filmed in black and white and I think what I like most
about it is the casual but at the same time competitive attitude the
young ballplayers have towards each other and that extra couple of grand.
I only wish I could have seen the original broadcasts when they were first
aired but these DVDs fill the bill nicely.

I rate Home Run Derby Volume 1  a very solid four stars.",1280275200,2,1777,4.521875
2826476,5,B000PMFRRY,"One reviewer felt that the original run of ""Home Run Derby"" went by little notice. Not for this 8 year old. When HRD was on,time stopped. Then,after it was over,a group of us got together to replay the episode,imitating the batting stance of each athlete,and imitating announcer Mark Scott,as well as our local Philadelphia Phillies announcers,including Hall of Famer By Saam,as well as Tastykake commercials which we inserted ourselves. And for years,we played HRD as one of our baseball-like games;lobbing an easy to wack wiffle ball as far as we could. It was quick to play,since basically you hit the ball or were out. No prizes,but many of those nights probably ended with a popsicle and catching lightning bugs. It didn't get any better than that summer. Interesting  wikipedia facts:ESPN Classics probably gained foothold from regular ESPN's pulling these shows out of the grave. Announcer Mark Scott died shortly after the season ended and the producers decided not to renew the show. What a shame. For a few weeks 50 years ago,the biggest hitters were on display upclose for the thrill of popping one over the fences. As good as a fresh pack of baseball cards with no repeats(""Don't Got'ems"" as opposed to""Got 'ems"") and sniffing the slab of bubble gum.",1274486400,,1262,4.981042654028436

This is just enjoyable nostalgia, a look back to when baseball players wore flannel and were middle class, not the spoiled multi-millionaire pains they are today. Many of the ballplayer participants are gone now and this is a delightful look at who they were, plus a pleasant contest between two ballplayers ... puts a personality along with that baseball card that we have of these guys. Don't expect a technologically and theatrically polished program, here, but just a 1960-ish fun program.

2826479,5,B000PMFRRY,"Talk about a stroll down memory lane, the episodes are from a TV show that was taped at Wrigley Field (a minor-league ballpark) in Los Angeles, California, and featured the home-spun commentary of Mark Scott and the distinct calls from umpire Art Passarella.

Originally aired in 1959, the program has had nine-lives for the nine-inning contests, with it being shown in syndication, on Fox Sports Net, and on ESPN Classic, the last time being in 2005 on the latter.

With such sluggers as Ernie Banks, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Willie Mays, Henry Aaaon and Rocky Colavito, it was truly a showcase of stars in a timeless game of seeing who can lay the heaviest lumber on the baseball.

The DVD is the first of three volumes, which is the complete season of shows. This is a classic round-tripper that will keep the hot-stove league burning throughout the year.",1212451200,,864,4.824324324324325
