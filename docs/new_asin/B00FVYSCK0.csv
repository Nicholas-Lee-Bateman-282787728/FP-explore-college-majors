8618800,2,B00FVYSCK0,"While I like the actual video itself, I was hugely disappointed that I cannot play it on a DVD player. I specifically bought this to take on the road so I can do yoga at hotels that have DVD players. Impossible! I am also not able to use it on a new DVD player I have at home.

The only way I can play this is on my computer. If I had known that, I would not have purchased this. That's why only 2 stars.

I see that Amazon NOW tells you that ""This will not play on most DVD players sold in the U.S., U.S. Territories, Canada, and Bermuda"".  This would have been EXTREMELY helpful if I had known this upfront.",1503100800,,609,3.9754098360655736
