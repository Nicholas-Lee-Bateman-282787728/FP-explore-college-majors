He has little to no interest in cartoon characters.  I read that babies love to watch other kids and see pictures of babies their age, so I figured these DVDs would be interesting to my son.  These DVDs are GREAT!!  My son LOVES it!  He loves watching the kids run around, play, interact and dance to the music.  He dances to the songs and laughs at the kids.  I even chuckle at the cute songs and kids at play.  It's like a baby music video :)  I highly recommend these videos!!!",1229990400,,615,4.092436974789916
