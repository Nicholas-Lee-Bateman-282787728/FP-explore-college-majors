6284282,1,B00IORPROU,"I am embarrassed to have even considered this movie, is a C movie worse than a B movie? Horrible, ridiculous and a complete waste of time.",1402617600,,138,4.346153846153846
6284283,3,B00IORPROU,"My first thought is I didn't get a sudden urge to turn it off.  I watched it to the end.  Although, there are the similarities of other dinosaur movies, this one did add some originality and I will give credit for that.  Movies seem to be cranking out a fast pace as a means to have something produced.  I do not like giving out a lot of details when I give my opinion, so here goes.

I liked the dinosaur, it was original as it was a hybrid.  I thought it funny to watch as usual all of the shooting with flash bang but you never see any damage or rounds hitting anything.  Why is it that the bad guys are intellectually challenged?  How do you become the leader of anything with no common or street sense?  So, you will get a laugh at how they are killed off.  Sometimes I wonder if any thought is put into some of the smaller creatures.  Scientists are making basic stupid mistakes, you will know what is going to happen.  Then to see something just born grow super fast and already vicious and impervious to anything.  There is the typical mating scene, you know sex has to be squeezed in there somehow.  I never understand how it is to be believed that people in real danger decides sex is more important than life?

So it's entertaining and a couple of surprises, if you are bored with nothing to do.  Sit down for a funny movie.",1402531200,,1335,4.238095238095238
6284284,4,B00IORPROU,"Went in expecting a Syfy type film and got something else entirely.  Ludicrous plotline, over the top characters, low budget cgi effects, and a song and dance finale!  On top of that we get a mad dr. with a heart problem, and a restaurant that serves squirrel and possum, and Lorenzo Lamas showing up for a morning's worth of work so they could get a ""name"" on the credits.  and did I mention that because of all this I absolutely LOVED this movie.  Decent practical effects as well as cgi (I even think I saw some stop motion in there!), a good sense of fun about the proceedings (check out the mailbox of the house next door to the dino farm), and enough campiness and heart to keep me watching through the whole thing.  The film goes a little closer to Troma than the Asylum, and its attitude was refreshing from the norm.  Just get ready to have as much fun as the actors and crew must have had!!  This is one I will definitely watch again as well as recommend to others.",1402444800,2,975,4.295081967213115
6284285,4,B00IORPROU,"This movie is not a main street movie, it is a cheesy science fiction movie about a dinosaur experiment gone wrong. The acting is not the best, but what can you expect from a movie such as this. I gave it a 4 star because I enjoy these kind of movies.

6284293,5,B00IORPROU,"If you're watching a movie like this, you KNOW it's going to be kind of stupid. But the dinosaurs are as good as Jurassic Park! The action action never stops, and the acting never starts. But come on. You're not watching this for talented actors or a complex screenplay. You wanna see a bunch of dumb teenagers get chased and mostly eaten by dinosaurs. That's what you get! In fact, I've watching hundreds of these kinds of movies, and this one was one of the most thrilling I've seen. There really are NO slow parts. Stupid parts, yes, but you'll be chewing your nails and wondering how they made one of these kinds of movies be so thrilling! Watch it! It's among the best in this genre I've ever seen!",1494806400,,703,4.415384615384616

The storyline and special effects were better than what you get fro the Syfy channel. The characters are caricatures and the acting is a bit over the top, but it all gels together in a fun, campy way.

The film has a formula plot. Mad scientist breeds hungry raptor, raptors escape, beging eating everyone in sight. We have a stranded band (gay rapper, Goth girl and party girl), stranded college guys (nerd, stud and fat stoner) and tough local girl who dreams of leaving town. They band together to try to survive till help arrives.

It's a campy takeoff on the big dino movies and it is so horribly bad that it's hysterically funny. I laughed all through it. The casting and costuming appeals to the old drive-in crowd and the storyline just...isn't. Once you say ""Dinosaurs escape and eat everyone."" you have the whole film in a nutshell. I loved the bits that harked back to Jurassic Park...the dinosaur breaking the sign and the truck chase...brilliant!

The acting was horrible and the cutting was worse and it made the entire film a semi-truck crash you can't take your eyes off.  You just HAVE to see what they come up with next.

m-i-s-l-e-a-d-i-n-g:
1.) The T-rex is LARGER.
2.) The Raptors're SMALLER.
3.) The artist's rendition of Lorenzo Lamas and Jana Mashonee isn't recognizable.
What confused the overwhelming majority of reviewers is that not only did the
""co-star"" Lorenzo Lamas NOT appear in any of the scenes W=I=T=H Jana Mashonee,
Lorenzo (Fernando Lamas's [1915-1982] son), he is only used in a ""wrap-around""
capacity... he is in a few of the 88-minute movie's openning and closing, scenes.
He is only seen in, no more than, 8-minutes of this movie, max.

At least when Mel Ferer's (1917-2008) son, [The Stand; RoboCop] is IN a movie,

The special effects are done exceptionally well. Of note is the scene in which a large
T-Rex stands a bus on end, flips, and spins it... after biting the head off of a woman
that a guy was making love with.

There was gratitous blood, skulls, bones and guts, but, no exposed breasts, and, very
little of Mister Lorenzo Lamas.

I laughed where I was supposed to; bit my fingernails; I winced; winked; and kept my
tongue, firmly, embedded in my cheek, as appropriate to the FUN in the farcical film.

The Native-American actress was subjected to ""Good ol' boy"" abuse by a macho-pig... that
got HIS just-desserts in the end. I'm VERY certain that Jana's character, was aware that

6284369,5,B00IORPROU,"Sure you could focus on the negatives, like the complete lack of acting ability by the main character, or plot holes  like ""why would a multi-ton dinosaur be rattling the bathroom door knob ?

But this movie is about dinosaurs, and that is where it shines .  This movie chose to invest in state of the art dinosaurs that look so sorta real that you actually almost believe !

In a world where ALL dinosaurs are crappy CGI , ( have you seen the new Jurassic park trailer ? ) it was nice to see realish looking puppets and  heads of life size creatures.  That was the best part . Realism.

Plus , you have Lorenzo lamas in several minutes of the movie! I don't know twhy but he was in there dammit !  So my advice is don't focus on the ""acting""  or even the ""writing"".  Focus on the dinosaurs .  after-all, isn't that why we're here ?",1424563200,12,1016,4.2020725388601035

R.W.",1410998400,,60,4.545454545454546
6284403,5,B00IORPROU,"The first thing to say about this movie is that the reviewers who criticized it for quality of realism and such were not even astute enough to realize what they were watching. If you cannot recognize a film's style, when it is so obviously telegraphed as this one's, you have no business writing reviews. We get two basic types of reviews here on Amazon, product commentary and actual literary and movie reviews. We also get the former that is attempting to be the latter. Some ordinary dudes and dudettes know a good or bad book or movie when they see it, for not every astute commentary is from some literary professional. This reviewer claims to be both ordinary dude and literary professional.

The movie is a fun campy parody of some of the blockbuster dino movies. And it does a good job of being that. The level of seriousness reminds me of my favorite Halloween movie, Midnight Hour, staring Sherry Belafonte Harper. We watched every Halloween in our family, sort of like you watch the seasonal Peanut specials. Then we lost the tape, but now someone left their DVD here, so this year we're on again. The Dinosaur Experiment is similar in tone, a serious, dangerous, sometimes pretty scary story wrapped in campy stereotypical silliness,  made possible by actors who quite successfully provide campy, stereotypical silliness.

And then there's Miss Mashonee, the reason I watched the movie. She's more or less the straight man (or rather woman) in all of this, the noble heroine. In fact she's so noble that she sort of apologizes to one guy she has been dismissive of just before he bites the dust, a nice touch I think. That small act of kindness elevated her character even more above the others. I'm familiar with the multitalented lady's music and have read and reviewed her novel. We have corresponded on occasion through social media. I knew the girl had her act together, so I wanted to see if she could act. I'm no expert but have done just enough community theater to know how hard it is and what it takes to act.

What it takes on the minimum level is the ability to act naturally, to be yourself. While a minimum requirement, it is one of the hardest things to do. It is very much like writing natural conversation if you are a novelist. The self conscious factor kicks in, and must be fought off.

I believe Jana Mashonee passed the test, and gave a nice little, campy, escapist movie the heroic central character that every movie needs to have any viewer care. You can't not care about this heroine. She's attractive BUT (and this is my favorite phrase on the subject) ""girl next door"" pretty. Deep down men like ordinary gals without coiffured hair and plastered on face paint. They like jeans and cutoffs, and long, uncombed, wind-blown hair. And to boot, her Native American qualities show on film. Guys, that's about as down home as it gets, American original. Men and women like courageous, smart women characters. Jana was all that and with a hunting bow.

There were tongue in cheek, campy moments for the female lead, but I had the impression that they were intended. For the rest of it, her actions were natural, as when she casually kicks a door open in desperation or helps another fugitive from the dinosaurs leap a chasm. Her conversation was natural. Nothing felt contrived. I thought all the actor's performances were of quality. There were distinct character types (almost stereotypes) highlighted by the young woman who was a Goth. She played that well, as did the other actors play their roles. The cheesy parts were clearly intentional. And therein lies my lack of understanding of the critical reviewers who thought they were going to see a competitive movie to Jurassic Park. On that point, unlike some critics, I was satisfied with the realism of the dinosaurs.

It is what it is, a fun romp with a seriously dangerous background. You get out of movies certain things that tell you if you wasted your time or not. I got the level of enjoyment that Midnight Hour used to give me every Halloween night. That was enough right there. But I also found out that Jana can act, and I'm hoping someone finds a great historical period drama where she can showcase her natural native beauty and acting talent within the story of her people. With her face, she could play an Indian woman from many different tribal or ethnic associations. She is Lumbee and Tuscarora, both Eastern peoples, but could play Sioux, Cheyenne, or Navajo as easily. She has a sort of universal Indian beauty.",1410825600,21,4517,4.717363751584284

6284413,5,B00IORPROU,"I think those giving this flick a low review are trying to be elitist or just plain jaded.  First, understand that this movie is camp.  It isn't obvious at first as, like all GOOD camp (and not the dumbed down, over-the-top camp of the Tromaville pics), it assumes a straight face.  It's subtle at first, but by the time that, about three fourths of the way through the movie, a badly mis-matched group of prehistoric carnivores gather to engage in a sort of dino smack-down, it becomes rather obvious, and the supporting cast also become increasingly silly, as if the director relaxed any real effort to control his actors at this point.  In fact, it's plain to see that the likeable cast is having fun making this bit of schlock, and I found their mood to be catching. Meanwhile, Jana Mashonee, who plays the main character, continues on in the best Adam West tradition as if she's attending a funeral, and this actually works.  Speaking of Jana, watching her, um, form is reason alone to see this movie.

The dinos, though CGI, were surprisingly good for a low-budget flick, noticeably better than most monsters I'd seen in the ""made for SyFy originals"" with far less use of repeat shots.  I just wish they hadn't made what I thought was a rather unfortunate choice for the color of the ""boss"" critter.  And while I'm comparing it to SyFy films, I'd like to point out that, though, yes, this is that sort of thing, it is done better than most of what I've seen produced by them.  This may be why I enjoyed this movie as much as I did, as I was expecting a SyFy flick, and it exceeded that expectation.

Anyway, if you like B-movies, dinosaurs, and hot babes, check out this little gem.  Yes, it requires you to pull the stick out in order to enjoy it, but, lately, I've been so disappointed with the recent crop of B-flicks (especially the prevalence of so many unconvincing ""found footage"" crap) that this one was an oasis in a desert of decently made trash.",1407974400,,1962,4.529745042492918

If they had kept that dopey title, I would have automatically passed on it, sight unseen.  That silly title aptly suits this doomed venture.  However ferocious the dinosaurs were, everyone else played it for laughs, slapstick and otherwise.  The problem is there's really nothing to laugh about.  The characters are straight out of the Looney Tunes handbook of whacky but not fun.  They arrive at the scene of the crime in waves of stupidity.  There are three college losers heading for Taos.  There's a broken down bus with three dubious entertainers onboard.  There's the town full of yahoos.  There's a flotilla of special agents investigating suspicious deaths by unknown animals.  And there's a waitress named Abbi Whitecloud (Jana Mashonee), who has zero presence, zero personality, zero talent...........and she's the lead character!!!  I knew I was in trouble when the movie starts out with her droning narration of previous events.  Ouch.  Not even the artfully done CGI dinosaurs could salvage this mess.  I blame everyone involved.  (Even more puzzling is the cover art on the DVD case.  The two models shown are not in this movie.  How bizarre is that!)

The plot is basically what you'd expect.  Some crazy mad scientist creates dinosaurs; they get loose and start eating people.  They pick them off one by one.  The weirdest scene has to be the carnage that takes place in the town of Fossil Ridge.  Only the kids being chased and eaten are involved.

Predictable and without a gripping plot, (other than we all ran out of gas in this tiny podunk town at the same time) these teens get chomped, ripped and torn to pieces by dinosaurs.

8644230,1,B00IORPROU,"If you can't make a movie, film a lot of blood and gore and maybe no one will notice.  Another good trick is to change the title after awhile to squeeze out some more sales and rentals from people not realizing its the same movie.  This one used to be called RAPTOR RANCH.

This thing did not have to be so bad but the script is full of silly details such as Dr. Cane has a heart problem, when asked where his medicine is, he says in the attic.  Boy,  that's where I keep all of my stuff which I may need for an immediate emergency.  Then there is the crime scene tech who says she's through and going back to Quantico.  They are in rural Texas, 200 miles from the nearest town with an airport.  Of course the FBI would send a tech from Virginia, a tech who got to the scene before the agents stationed  in Texas.  And Billy Wayne.  What can I say?  Rural doesn't mean dirty, disgusting and disgraceful.  I've spent a lot of time out in the country.  None of my friends, acquaintances and relatives would eat at Billy Wayne's place or socialize with him.  Maybe the local druggies, drunks and criminals might.  But, professionally, I've known a lot of them too.  It may surprise the general public, but many of them have standards which Billy Wayne doesn't meet.

And of course there are the victims who become dinosaur chow.  Of course they split up.  Of course they go toward the growling. Of course they ignore warning signs.  One of the silliest scenes is Little Willie in the restroom and a raptor doesnt just shake the door knob, he tries to turn it.  We see this from inside so maybe it's the Rottweiler at the door, but it is the raptor who  enters.  There is probably plenty more but I stopped watching.  In large letters at the beginning of the movie is the legend, ""Uncork'd Entertainment"".  I would guess that the people responsible for this mess uncork'd quite a few while making this thing.

The fact that this movie is supposed to be a Red Box hit may say more about Red Box than about the movie.  I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime.",1527638400,,2052,4.3430079155672825

Plot? What plot? I don't expect much in this genera, but, come on! You can see the SEAMS in in the dino-puppets' heads. The ""horror"" in this movie is the movie itself. Even thought of as a ""drinking game,"" as one reviewer said, you'd have to be stone-drunk or stone-stoned to even find this minimally funny.

The worst is the editing, and that's saying a lot, given the other sins committed by this ""movie."" At any moment, you can't figure out the sequence of events, the time of day, what's happening with what character on what day relative to other characters on what might well be other days (or nights), or even whether a car is going straight down the road or turning. There's really no describing how disjointed the editing is. So, all you can do is wait for some action, and that is VERY slow in coming.

8644234,3,B00IORPROU,"If you're looking for a ""decent"" dino movie, this isn't it.  If you're looking for a sort of drinking game, pouring a shot and whoever guesses gets eaten next downs it, it can be fun - especially if you laugh about it.  The characters are like video game ambient creatures - the kind of characters that have absolutely no sense, no brains and will stand around while major danger is going on, and do nothing to protect themselves (like run the hell away and keep going) and can get slaughtered by sneezing on them.  This reminded me of an elaborate game of tag, with the dino's being ""it"" and being very good at  the game, with the others acting like lobotomized zombies in their attempts not to be tagged out.

By the end of the movie, I was rooting for the dinos.

So, for utterly brainless mayhem, with the dinos being better at selling their roles than the actors were, this isn't THAT awful.  I've suffered through a lot worse ones than this one.  By watching this movie, you will NOT atone for any MAJOR sins, but some of the lesser ones will probably be let go.

8644236,3,B00IORPROU,"The Dinosaur Experiment is about a girl named Abbi who's shy of her 22nd birthday.  She lives in a small Texas town 100 miles from the closest big city and one gas station.  She wants to be a famous singer who becomes so big she forgets where she came from.  We see a poorly animated dinosaur attack a man or woman.  You can clearly tell it's fake. We now see a man walk into his barn just to see guts on his table and a dinosaur roaring.  The man talks to the dinosaur and says he loves him.  We see Abby get out of bed and a man on her answering machine telling her she's late.

A young man enters his professor's class goofing off.  Outside Abbi hitchhikes her way to a guy name Billy Wayne's house.  The driver gets out of the truck and scoops away road kill.  Two high school kids goof around outside with a chubby man in his car as the two friends discuss all the breasts they can get.  Abbi arrives to the diner with her breasts sticking out.  She's a waitress, and with a chest like that a mighty good one!  Her boss treats women like crap though.  A silly black guy performs in front of these men but the white racists chase him away.

Meanwhile the high school kids have a discussion.  The one driving says he can live to be 200 years old and never run out of stuff.  We see two big city cops in their office room talking about a  mysterious creature killing people in a small Texas town.  The black performer and his two female friends drive down the road.  They mention getting a tan and having fun after getting a box of twinkies.  The black performer says he likes little white men. The two high school kids talk about how much money they have.  The big city cops are also driving.  They wonder what that smell is (Texas altogether) and blame each other.

The cops, along with the local authorities, investigate the footprints and dead carcass of an African American body.  They think it's a wild dog.  An older man who just got done hunting walks into a gas station as all the men roar and whistle at Abbi filling up someone's gas outside.  She runs up to an older man who says he spent his whole life researching and can't wait to show everyone what he's found.  He says life is ironic.  ""Whatever you decide to do you give it your best"".

The cops stop by a diner as the black performer's vehicle starts to smoke.  The cops realize something is going in this town.  3 people missing in 3 months.  The cops think it could be a number of things responsible for the deaths.  The one thinks it's illegal aliens and drug ringers.  Meanwhile the old man who said life is ironic has a heart attack outside while working on his farm.  The teens pull up to the gas station where Abbi works.  The boss of the place says these teens are crap out of luck since they don't have any gas.  Just then the black performer pulls up in his red hippie bus.  The two women with him step out of the bus in sexy fashion.

Just then they hear a loud roar.  The boss says it's some kind of freaky experiment.  The teens want to know where Dr. Cane lives since the boss of the gas station says he's the one who has the gas.  The boss encourages Abbi to take the teens to Dr. Cane.  The one teen finds out he went to school with the one girl who's part of the black performer's act.  As everyone walks down the road late at night a dinosaur can be seen roaming around.  The local authorities conclude a velociraptor is responsible for the deaths.  It's a nocturnal dinosaur and one of the most ferocious hunters on the planet.

The man who had a heart attack waves the teens and Abbi away by saying ""You shouldn't be here!  It's not safe!"" but they take him inside his house.  One of the teens freaks out when he thinks he sees a plastic toy flamingo turn and growl at him.  He wanders to the shed in the back yard.  Meanwhile inside the doctor's house there's a vicious white lion in a cage.  When the teen asks Dr. Cane if he can borrow some gas, he flips forward off his couch.  He must've flipped his lid at the possibility of someone borrowing gas for free!  Abbi and the teen who hallucinates look around the doctor's house at all his strange creations including baby dinosaurs.

Inside the one teen tries to revive the doctor but he throws up in the teens mouth instead.  The teens walk to the shed to see the baby dinosaurs.  They freak out and run outside.  The teen who hallucinates accidentally turns on the lights/electricity around the farm which makes the dinosaurs able to detect Abbi and the hippie girl outside.  This same teen also accidentally opens the doors letting the raptors out of their silos!  They approach the two girls.  Soon bigger dinos are released from their pens.  The teens quickly jump in their trucks and drive away.  The dinos chase after them in a pretty freaky looking scene.

Abbi is tired of the one teen complaining and hitting on her, so she tells him to leave.  No way man!  Don't enter the darkness!  They see the boss laying on his couch when they enter a home.  Suddenly a dinosaur rips through the roof and pulls the boss off his couch squirting blood everywhere.  The dino then roams around the property while the teen and Abbi remain frightened inside.  At the gas station the dinosaurs have arrived!  The black performer uses the bathroom as he hears a dog being eaten outside.  While on the toilet the door swings open and a dinosaur eats him alive.  As the one teen and his old classmate/now girlfriend have sex in a van the dinosaur enter and bites the girl's head off leaving the teen alone to have sex with a headless woman.

The other teens run away from the dinosaur through the dark forest.  They hide in a tunnel and use a moment of distraction to leave.  The teens ask Abbi how these creatures that have been extinct for millions of years suddenly came back to life.  They play the blame game until they see the two dinosaurs approach. The teens run around in a circle and find themselves back at the gas station.  They find the teen who witnessed a dinosaur rip his girlfriend's head off.  Someone begins to panic which alerts the dinosaur's attention.  Abbi with a bow in hand recommends going back to the bus and leaving.

They enter the bus and drive.  When they stop the bus a dinosaur approaches as the teen has his back turned.  He closes the back door of the bus at the last second while the dinosaur eyes him up and rocks the bus.  The dino soon flips the bus over and spins it around like a toy.  The teens and Abbi run into a shed and hide.  Well except the one teen who doesn't get along with Abbi.  He sticks around while the dinosaur keeps turning the flipped over bus.

Later when he steps back outside the dinosaur blows stinky breath all over him.  He walks back to the bus and throws the dino a chunk of fresh meat.  We can only assume the meat is from that girl who had her head bitten off.  I think it's her arm.  He runs to the shed where his friends are hiding but the one friend doesn't want to open the door right away.  He actually forgot what to do, lol.  ""Hmmm, oh yeah!  Open the door to let my friend in!""  Outside the dinos fight each other on the town streets, including a super aggressive blue dino.

The teens have a weird discussion about their football memories and how their friend became obsessed with flamingos and that's why he got distracted.  In the store one teen puts on armor and looks silly.  He reminds his friend that the whole point of this trip with his friend is for the purpose of female breasts.  He says we're human and smarter than dinosaurs.  This guy steps outside and says he's going to take the dinosaur's eye out.  Just then the dinosaur flips him in the air and swallows him whole.

The dinosaurs continue to fight each other outside while the one girl pretends she's fishing in the store.  Yeah, I haven't mentioned this girl yet since she isn't very interesting, but she's some gothic chick.  When the dinos electrocute each other over the nearby telephone poles the teens use this chance to escape.  It's now morning.  They run to an abandoned warehouse and soon the dinos approach.  The one male teen falls in mud but wakes up when blood from a pipe drips on his face.  Abbi and the other girl climb to higher areas and run away.  The one persistent blue dinosaur manages to find Abbi and her friend. Abbi shoots at the creature with a bow and arrow.

Abbi and the other teen (that guy who likes Abbi but she feels indifferent about him) get a surprise when the blue dino is able to break through the heavy door where they're hiding.  Afterwards the one girl is stomped on leaving Abbi and the one male teen alone.  When the blue dino breaks the door open they jump from a high area.  The dinosaur jumps down to greet them.  The dino stomps on the one guy's back and crushes him leaving Abbi as the last one alive.  She sneaks through a wide open room but the blue dino continues his pursuit.  She creates an explosive trail that leads to the blue dino as the creature tries to get through a door.  This makes the entire warehouse explode.  The big city cops actually hear the explosive noise and wake up out of bed, lol.

Abbi tells her story to the FBI but they don't believe her.  The government officials don't believe the native girls and would rather call the dinosaurs return a big myth.  Abbi goes through with her career goal as a singer while the dinosaur outside hears the song and apparently enjoys it enough to bite the camera man.

You know the Dinosaur Experiment is pretty good.  Nothing great, but good.  It doesn't really detail the dinosaurs habitat or what encourages them to attack humans.  The story skips all this stuff and instead focuses on a smaller story involving young men and women running around town and away from the dinosaurs.  It's still a better movie than Jurassic World because it doesn't rely on silly unbelievable CGI special effects.  As you know CGI special effects ruined Jurassic World because it doesn't look like the dinosaurs are actually in the same room with the people they're chasing.  In the Dinosaur Experiment, at least the dinos actually appear to be chasing the townspeople.  That's the whole point of a dinosaur thriller.  Otherwise the dialogue is pretty weak since these characters are never once interesting (especially those 3 party teen guys- ugh) but I have no issues with anything else.",1502755200,,10366,4.392518440463646
