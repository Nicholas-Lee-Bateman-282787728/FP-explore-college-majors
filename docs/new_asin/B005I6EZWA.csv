8474285,4,B005I6EZWA,"DVD is good. We see the son of the originator doing the 3 basic forms. Not much more. Plays on my tele, but not on my computer (although I haven't tried any real tricks yet, so that may not be a total reality).

I would recommend it to all Uechi Ryu students.",1423785600,,259,3.980769230769231
