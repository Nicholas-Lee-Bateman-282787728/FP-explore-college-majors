8030685,4,B0002QPM46,"Lola has the characteristics of French New Wave films that I enjoy -- charm, grace, pensiveness, humor. It does not have them in spades like some of the classics of that era but, nonetheless, the film is a quite satisfying view. The intersecting lives motif works here (and does not feel forced). Anouk Aimee is good actress to watch. Chances are that if Lola comes up on your radar, you will find it to be a film worth seeing.",1443830400,,427,4.417721518987341
8030686,1,B0002QPM46,"I already have two previous versions of this film from Amazon with disgusting video quality and after receiving this Passion Productions release now I have three.

Nowhere on the  case or DVD is listed a release date.

The menu has two options only...... PLAY and SCENE SELECTIONS...... that is it!

What is worse, the details section for this version in the Amazon listing specifies English Subtitles and there are none!

If that isn't enough..... the run time is NOT the advertixed 97 minutes but only 90.

The Amazon Digital Gold Collection Version has superior video quality to this (though still bad) and at least has 5.1 surround sound.",1396224000,,642,4.898148148148148
8030687,1,B0002QPM46,It was very grainy. Very poor quality. I could not watch more than five minutes of it. Sorry I got it.,1376179200,,102,3.9047619047619047

After two previous films and a lengthy career directing episodes of such TV classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GILLIGAN-S-ISLAND/dp/B000X07QSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GILLIGAN'S ISLAND</a>&nbsp;and THE BANANA SPLITS, Richard Donner here helmed a top-flight cast in one of his now most forgotten works.

In an Italian production filmed in Scotland, London and NYC, Bronson is a middle-aged American adult novelist romanced by a London teenager, a relationship that eventually brings them to the altar. Thus, after they got married in a fever, the fire went out and they've been talkin' 'bout Jackson. Though not exactly a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lee-Hazlewood-lyric/dp/B0000032BN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lee Hazlewood lyric,</a>&nbsp;in the words of 10CC's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Hang-Up/dp/B000001FPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Hang Up</a>,"" it's ""marriage on the rocks"" time.

Here, the child-woman seduces the writer against his and her parents' better judgment. They wed, move to New York and soon the reality of two very different lives hits home. In an ironic twist, despite reservations about how a divorce might unbalance his young wife, SHE'S the one with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leavin-on-her-Mind/dp/B0002B163W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leavin' on (her) Mind</a>"" (OK, no more song references!). After a chalkboard ""tata!"" from the flighty girl, it's back to Jolly Old for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-O-L-A/dp/B0001XLXDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L-O-L-A</a>&nbsp;(I lied, so sue me!).

Leg men will love the many mini-skirts on display here, but as romantic comedies go this curio is very slight. (Watch for airport cameo from Mrs. Bronson, Jill Ireland.)
