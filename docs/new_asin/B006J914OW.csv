The acting was really good as well as the photography.  Usually the cheaper horror or supernatural movies are pretty bad......this one is a cut above.

4992834,1,B006J914OW,"Plot: A young female's sister is murdered which results in dreams and hallucinations of seeing her dead sister walking in the park, in the city, etc. She always running after her dead sister's living image or is it her ghost? In either case she never seems to quite get to her without some interference such as a car passes between them or a tree happens to be in the way. A been done before storyline.

Cheapness: Filmed in Prague with mostly Czech actors who speak some English but as far as the film the combination of no subtitles; really poor audio quality and loudness control forces you had to be constantly turning the volume up to hear something or turning it down to reduce the cheap overbearing screams and sound effects. Bad ghost type killer was just someone who painted his face black. A lot of the now overused hand held camera technique. Confusing storyline that just didn't go anywhere - I've already forgotten what it was. You also have to wonder why it's being released into DVD almost four years after being filmed.

Spoiler: Final scene of second sister being stabbed and lying on the floor was so brief that if you blinked you might miss it.",1330473600,18,1163,4.586538461538462

4992859,2,B006J914OW,"I just watched this film, and I was very into it until the end, when I felt I needed a bit more clarity to the events and characters. I was hoping for the connections of the characters, especially that of the kids and and the Dark Spirit, to be fleshed out more. But the story just ends without any real explanations, and left me feeling let down and kind of confused. I would have liked the story to be laid out more clearly- not that I need to be ""spoon fed"" the plot points, just a little less ambiguity.
This film could have been so amazing if they had just delved deeper into the mystery and given us viewers some more answers, more story and less ""Ava being freaked out"" scenes- albeit the actress is very beautiful to watch and some freak out scenes are necessary for atmosphere. But some editing so as to include more story (answers) and tie up some of the loose ends is seriously in order.
I'm still left with so many questions...

  ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT TIME***

Like: Why was this all happening? Who was the Dark Spirit? How did these kids come into contact with him? If they thought of him as an ""imaginary playmate"" when they were little, did he not show he was evil then? Did the Dark Spirit try to hurt the kids? What was the unremembered trouble that the Medium friend had growing up? Why were the others so effected by the Dark Spirit, but not the actual Medium? Is she going to be attacked now as well? What was the Inspector researching in those books with the mystic symbols? What exactly did he discover that was significant enough to get him killed? What was the significance of that building/house where Teresa and the inspector were killed? Who was the mysterious homeless guy in the park, and what was the connection between him and Ava, the others, the house and the Dark Spirit? What was the deal with the mugger who stabbed a guy, then started chasing Ava? Was he supposed to be possessed by the Dark Spirit? What happens with him? Why was Ava repeatedly told that Teresa still needs her help? Did the Teresa ghost actually help Ava in any way, or get helped by Ava? Was there a purpose behind the hauntings?

Also, since the entire cast is Czech, why not have the dialogue be in Czech with English subtitles? I thought that would have been cooler.",1434240000,,2281,4.43436754176611

I would like to see her in another movie  in order to form an opinion on her acting ability and skills. The male lead was just awful, but then again, he had to work with  what he was given.

No unbelievable elements, even crossing into fictional ""demonic"" elements. It was done artfully. Better then a lot of movies I have seen, truth be told. Remniscient of a Hitchcock shivers down your spine horror movie, not slasher get afraid of the psycho directly watching mass murder.

4992883,4,B006J914OW,"Well, though I can't say I thoroughly understand the story, this movie is far better than anything else I have watched lately in the  horror genre--my favorite. The story kept me intrigued, wondering what would happen next. The implied ending is likely to leave many viewers unsatisfied, but there is plenty of mindless drivel out there to amuse those folks. Here's what I've got so far, without stewing a bit on the plot (which often results in further understanding):the two sisters lived in Prague as children, and their playmates included the Medium and the Murderer. The Medium and the younger sister, Theresa,  had an ""imaginary"" playmate that turns out wasn't so imaginary, and this dark spirit has attached itself to the younger sister it seems, since she suffers from depression and problems that her older sister doesn't understand and eventually gets tired of dealing with.  Eventually the spirit drives the disturbed young man who was once the girls' friend to murder Theresa. When older sister Eva returns to Prague, the spirit finds her again and haunts her and anyone she comes into contact with. At one point the boyfriend gives Ava a book on parallel lives, and I think this event foreshadows the ending--when Eva's ghost forewarns herself in a parallel life, which she is able to do because ""time is different here"" as her ghost-sister tells her.  In spite of the story not being laid out more plainly for the sure understanding I would like, the movie is well-acted, and suspenseful, and the way the ghost makes itself known is creepy and believable. This is a great atmospheric story of a malevolent spirit haunting and causing the deaths of two sisters.",1407196800,19,1674,4.925531914893617

Although I'm not familiar with the actors, I have seen czech films with much, much better acting. True this was either dubbed or the actors speaking english themselves, I had no problems with the language but perhaps if it was spoken in their language and subtittled in english, the acting could have had more quality, I don't know, or maybe the acting IS bad. Also, I expected a little more suspense and to have more action with the spirits. A bit of a slow movie but not entirely bad.

4992894,3,B006J914OW,"Dark Spirits is a ghost/horror story set in Prague involving two rival sibling sisters one of whom is murdered. The surviving sister is suffering from guilt for not coming to the aid of her now dead sister. She is also plagued with nightmares and visions of her sister and her possible murderer.
Everyone she comes in contact with will suffer from thses same traumas including her boyfriend, neighbor and the cop investigating the murder.
That is the basic storyline for the movie that takes the viewer slowly down many different paths that leaves the surviving sister scared and confused as well as the viewer.
The story touches on several different possibilities for what happened to the sister and what is happening to the surviving sister and the people she comes in contact with. The multi directional paths the story takes is what hurts this movie and leaves so many wondering what happened here and why and who are these people that are causing all of this chaos. At times I think even the director and the writer got a little lost or confused telling the story. I do not know how experienced the director was, so I don't know if they overextended thmselves trying to tell this very difficult to produce story or not. These multi directional stories are hard to get right and to have them coalesces into a coherent story.
On the plus side of this movie, we have an attractive cast that do a decent job of acting with some exceptions. Their english is clear and understandable except for a few occasions when I had to replay the conversations. Some of the location cinematography is beautifully shot as well some of the scenes of cast interaction. The combining of the beautiful cinematography and the attractive cast and interesting albeit confusing story made this movie worth the time to watch.
The movie doesn't have a lot of violent scenes and most is left to the viewers imagination and the same can be said for the sex scenes that are void of nudity. There is very little cursing if any at all. As far as gore is concerned there isn't really any except for some blood. The special effects are almost non existent and the special effects makeup is also limited with ok results.
This can/is a confusing and slow paced story that's hard to follow at times that is very well shot throughout most of the movie that does come together somewhat at the end if you are paying attention throughout the movie. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE if you are looking for a mindless fast pacing, sex/nudity, gore and violence in your movie. 3 Very cautious stars.",1391904000,10,2550,4.668888888888889

Lighting needs adjustment on some scenes. There are scenes where I can't even see the actress'/actor's facial expression due to dark insufficient lighting or focus on the face. There are scenes where the camera is too ""shaky"". I guess the cast and film crew are trying to do a first person view but even for a second person view the camera is still juggling around. The lead female character has too much eye liner that it hides away her facial expression when needed. This is I think one of those that I can consider soft-porn; too much kissing, female character wears a bra-less outfit almost every scene where she is at home.

SPOILER ALERT!!! There is a bath tub scene where the lead female character had whole body nudity but the torso part the some part of the chest are covered with little bubbles.

There is not much of a plot development. The film took several directions but left much unanswered in the film until the ending.

SPOILER ALERT!!! The plot seems to revolve around a parallel world and dimension hopping although not much was touched on it. Like I said, the film tried to take on several directions that none of it seems to be finished.

It was apparently shot for an American audience because everyone spoke English with a heavy accent, and even the books and writing were in English. The plot was difficult to follow for me, maybe because I was bored by the incredibly slow pace and uninteresting script...I kept finding my attention drifting away.  Another reason I stuck with the movie was that I found the main actress, Milena Minichova, smoking hot. I know, I hang my head in shame.  I didn't really get the ending, but it was a surprise. The only really interesting scenes were between the heroine and the crazy homeless guy she'd run into in the park.  The ""horror"" element was so mild that I had to crank up my volume so it would startle me.  No real horror here, just a spooky ghost that pops up now and then.  The dead sister element was never explained, at least I didn't get it.  I honestly didn't understand any of it, but hey...Milena WAS smoking hot!",1365811200,3,1136,4.4326923076923075

Except this is all a dream, maybe,  and the dark spirit is coming for her because....well it is and she and her bff have seen spirits since childhood.

That's about it....Oh the guy in the park. Now That's it. Very boring. Nothing like the DVD cover. Felt like watching a bad 1970'ds horror. Managed to make it to a 10 DVD pack.
