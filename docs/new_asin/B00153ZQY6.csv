3140100,5,B00153ZQY6,"If you find your self as one of those people that flip through the channels and stumble across something that is on discovery channel, history channel, or animal planet and starting watching an educational program about something that you would never of thought of watching because your caught up in the interesting subject matter than this is for you.  There is of coarse a lot of people that are going to have there own opinions on what happened at the beginning of time and how earth shaped out to be what it is today but when it comes down to it nobody is ever going to know for sure 100%.  Although this colaboration of videos is amazing and takes you on a ride through history.  Its not just a lot of well educated people speaking into a camera about what they think happened but a bunch of excellect CG reanactment of what creature and enviorments may have been like and looked like why back when.  It catches your attention and keeps it. Reasons are given how people came across why they think this is what happened and how everything just kept changing and changing.  Creatures that could be looked on as true monster roaming our earth and ones that are still around today. There is so much to see the best thing to do is just to watch it yourself.  I highly recommend this series not just for adults but children will be caught up into it as well.",1275609600,5,1357,4.429718875502008
3140101,5,B00153ZQY6,"I purchased Prehistoric Earth, a Natural History, which is a 6 disc set, a ""Walking With"" Collection because it contained all of the really important discs in the evolutionary series from the beginning of life to man.  Disc 1 is Before the Dinosaurs; Disc 2 is Walking with Dinosaurs; Disc 3 is Allosaurus plus extras; Disc 4 is Prehistoric Earth; Disc 5 is Walking with Prehistoric Beasts; Disc 5 is the Making of Walking with Prehistoric Beasts; and Disc 6 is Walking with Cavemen.

There were other collections entitled Walking With, but they were incomplete.  Prehsitoric Earth is the only collection that gives you the whole big picture.

The series was well done, and the recreations were based on scientific and physical evidence.

I recommend this collection to those who want to see the whole big picture.",1272067200,51,814,4.912408759124087
3140102,5,B00153ZQY6,"This was a amazing series! So much information and so many hours of high end computer generated creatures. For anyone that thought our world went from one celled creatures to T-rex to woolly mammoths, this is an eye opener. It really fills in the gaps and helps make sense of evolution.",1267315200,7,286,4.627450980392157
3140103,5,B00153ZQY6,greatly enjoyed the high quality bbc work -- must have kept a lot of paleontologists at work for years.,1264809600,2,103,4.473684210526316
3140104,5,B00153ZQY6,"This is an excellent series for introducing people to prehistoric life, and is beautiful in the way it envisions what life may once have been like.

Be forewarned that there are numerous artistic liberties taken with the facts in this film.  It frequently shows animals interacting that never lived together, though most of the time animals LIKE those pictured lived together.

So, it's not a hyper-accurate scientific documentary, but it's illuminating, and gives people a lot to think about.  I find that, for my schoolkids, the information is ""accurate enough"" and that many times they become interested in the material and learn more deeply about the information in the film on their own.",1257120000,25,692,5.097345132743363
3140105,5,B00153ZQY6,Excellent Video.  I highly recommend these videos to any Dinosaur enthusiast or to any Science teacher out there.  It is worth watching these videos with your entire class.  Great Educational tool.,1252972800,4,197,5.290322580645161
3140106,4,B00153ZQY6,"It`s entertaining and the cgi visuals are excellent. But keep in mind that much of what you see in the films is best guess or even made up.
It`s really more of an entertainment program than a real documentary.
But keeping that in mind, watch it. It is very entertaining and your kids will love it.",1243728000,4,297,4.321428571428571
3140107,1,B00153ZQY6,this is a fiction story advertised and sold as a non-fiction fact.... the narrator makes only subtle hits to this fact. when paying as much as this film was and expecting a non-fiction story i got robbed. this item should be categorized with movie as fiction. i was offended as to the way the narrator made constant remarks throwout the story that this is a factual story that it had to be this way or that because of this and that when we all know no one has any true knowledge or facts of this time era. the only thing i found nice in this story was the filmography had some very nice nature scenes. i would not rec amend this story to anyone i would rec amend to watch a story like Jurassic park first.,1234396800,3,705,4.1911764705882355
3140108,5,B00153ZQY6,"Reading Richard Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"" parallel with watching episodes of this awesome vdieo series (not intentionally) really was a moving experience.  I knew halfway through TSG I would never look at humans the same way again, and was awstruck by the awesome power of evolution in relation to the age of the earth.  I was curious how accurate this video series would be, but it is very accurate.  It covers almost all aspects of evolutionary theory including animal aggression, kin altruism and of course the evolutionary adaptations that various species have gone through in their millions of years of existence.  This is worth the money you pay because there are plenty of hours of video and each ""period"" is covered from the earliest sea animals through the dinosaurs to land animals and humans.  The video is all computer generated, obviously, since no video footage could possibly exist for our ancestors (did I even need to say that? haha), but it's well made.  It isn't very cheesy at all.  I highly recommend this video series for anyone interested in the theory of evolution and behavior of these fascinating animals...our distant relatives!  (creationist nutcases: save yourself the time and money).",1217376000,47,1216,5.075376884422111

Now I watch it whenever I want to watch it which is a lot. Thank you!",1454371200,,241,3.4814814814814814
3140133,5,B00153ZQY6,"I got this as a present, but actually got to watch it at the receiver's house for a wonderful night in watching prehistoric monsters, beasts, and dinosaurs!  I am between degrees in paleontological anthropology, and have already seen most of the natural history programs out there.  I personally love the ""Walking with Beasts"" and ""Walking with Monsters"" best, as I know the least about them.  I have a famous Burgess Shale description book (I can't remember the name), and the ""Walking with Monsters"" is just like the creatures (including scorpion ancestors and trilobites) are swimming off the page!  For the price, this collection is such a great bargain.  I almost bought the one that was twice the price, but there is plenty of footage here, including lots of behind-the-scenes for those who love that!",1453161600,,807,4.992537313432836

3140151,5,B00153ZQY6,"Every episode is packed with details that prompt me to continue watching them over and over. The animation is at times breathtaking, particularly in the mammoth sequence. One of the best parts of this series is the ""Making of Walking with Beasts"" episode, which includes a nice explanation of the immediate effects of the K/T event, along with startling factoids about the meteor strike that I've never seen collected in one place anywhere. While there may be some fact stretching as to the size of one or two aquatic animals, it is easy to overlook if you know the latest estimates. Great dig site commentary offered as well. This is an altogether rewarding experience that keeps me coming back again and again.",1439596800,,712,4.844262295081967

3140154,2,B00153ZQY6,"I got this because my 4 young sons LOVE dinosaurs and watch National Geographic dino shows a lot.  This has a lot of blood, I think to make up for lack of content.  Nat. Geo will have experts on explaining why they think whatever hypothesis they've stated.  This set just has things set as fact and I have no idea why or how someone came up with some of the things that are stated.  I want my children to learn true things when they watch tv.  I realize that most of what we watch about dinosaurs can be supposition, but at least support your ideas.  The older boys (ages 6 and 7) like to watch these.  But my 3 year old twins every time grab the National Geographic.  I am so disappointed.  I was expecting the same quality as BBC Life and BBC Planet Earth.",1435968000,2,758,4.172413793103448
3140155,1,B00153ZQY6,I purchased this DVD set among others for my son's birthday and he was very excited to have received it- but unfortunately the DVDs are all Region 1 which I now understand can only be played back in USA or on a different DVD player which is coded for different regions. This information would have been handy before purchasing as the shipping address and log-in is clearly in Australia. As a parent it was devastating to see the excitement fading from my son's face as we are unable to play them.,1434585600,,496,4.461538461538462

Got it and plopped it into the DVD.

Nooooooo. I live in Europe and it's only possible to veiw it in the US. (WTF?????)
I looked and read and tried my best to se what I was byuing but nowhere did I see that it was only meant for viewing in the US.

I just didn't like how they made the meat -- too red and bloody, especially for little children.

Oh, and the Allosaurus disk came empty. There was nothing on it.  I never had the time to inquire about it or ask for exchange. Did anybody have the same problem?",1386374400,,301,4.155172413793103

3140202,2,B00153ZQY6,"I've only seen the first two DVDs, but since I'm unlikely to watch the rest will report anyway.

First, the good: The animals are well done and the animations are generally pretty good. The animals' shapes, methods of movement, etc., all seem to be based on sound scientific input. Coloration and markings are of course speculative but mostly seem appropriate. Very nice, especially for TV.

Second, the bad: Most of the information on behavior and survival strategies is made up out of whole cloth. ""These creatures were cannibals,"" ""...hid from predators by hiding in piles of dung,"" ""...had specialized poison glands,"" and so forth. These are not just speculations, since they are based on no evidence at all. They are out-and-out inventions. Meanwhile Mr. Branagh's narration rolls on with no cautions whatever, as if they were the considered pronouncements of hordes of wise paleontologists. I'd say this makes up more than three-quarters of the narration. Beware!

Second, the bad again: Each episode ""tells a story"" -- a struggle for a water hole, babies surviving after birth, etc. But the plotting and storylines are slack and uninvolving. Boring. I fell asleep in disc 2. Animal Planet does it a lot better.

I was very disappointed in this series, which I was really looking forward to watching.",1346544000,8,1306,5.06046511627907
3140216,5,B00153ZQY6,"My wife and I love prehistoric topics. This film is absolutely the most realistic, well scripted, and well layed-out film on this topic. Nothing comes close! It takes you from the beginning of life through the whole evolutionary cycle to modern man. You truely think you are there through the entire presentation. If you have a large screen TV, this film will really make you think you are actually there. The lowest price I found was on Amazon and I received my film in only a few days with their free shipping.",1335052800,,512,4.576086956521739
3140217,5,B00153ZQY6,My Little girl loves these movies. She loves to watch anything with dinos and these are great and she watches them over and over. Well worth the money!,1334620800,,151,4.428571428571429
3140218,5,B00153ZQY6,"I'm a huge fan of Walking With Dinosaurs and all the other movies of the series (Walking With Monsters, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, Allosaurus, and Walking With Cavemen).  Most people who would be looking at this collection would already know what the series is about, but I'll speak briefly on it for newcomers.  Basically, all these films are faux nature documentaries.  When I say ""faux"" I mean to say that the narrative follows various extinct creatures around and describes them in a style similar to live action nature documentaries (such as the videos done by David Attenborough).  Obviously, they couldn't really follow a real dinosaur around, so the series does include some speculation that is presented as fact (because it would sound really awkward with their premise if we were watching ""real"" dinosaurs and they starting saying things like ""we think they may have done this"").  Still, the films do include a lot of good information and are highly entertaining.  This is a great series for either kids who are interested in dinosaurs or adults who still love watching dinosaur themed nature documentaries.  Anyway, Walking With Monsters covers the period of time before dinosaurs evolved, Walking With Dinosaurs covers the beginning and end of the dinosaur periods, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts covers the mammals that came after the dinosaurs, and Walking With Caveman covers the early human ancestors.  I'm less fond of Walking with Cavemen (just because it interests me less, but it's still good).

Anyway, since I love this series, I've been looking for ages for a Walking With... Collection that actually includes ALL of the materials from the series.  I've found several in the past (The Ultimate Walking With... Collection, The Complete Walking With... Collection) and despite their impressive names (such as having the word ""complete"" in their title), none of them actually included all the special features or even all of the series.  Prehistoric Earth: A Natural History is the first collection to actually include everything - all the episodes and all the special features.  The only thing that isn't included in this collection is the Nigel Marvin spinoff series Chased By Dinosaurs.

Lastly, let's talk about the actual packaging.  I'm very pleased to say that the dvd box is very nicely designed.  It's surprisingly thin and space efficient for a collection that has so many DVDs.  I'm also pleased to say that the dvd holding cases are arranged a lot like a book - you can just flip through the plastic ""pages"" that each hold a conveniently labeled DVD.  The holders work well and are simple to use.  The flip out front cover also has all the DVDs listed with a description of what's in each one, including listing the special features.  Overall, I'm thoroughly pleased with the design.  So, if you are interested in getting this whole series, you'd do well to ignore all those other collections and just go straight for this one.  Also, you may be interested in checking out Chased by Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Park (Nigel Marvin's spin-off series based on the Chased By Dinosaurs spinoff show).",1324857600,19,3132,5.042718446601942
3140219,5,B00153ZQY6,"I feel that the education provided in the public school system (at least in my experience) with regard to the history of life on Earth is entirely inadequate, and is often flagrantly absent. These videos are captivating. This is an area of learning where seeing images can really be helpful. Now, when I read about a given prehistoric time period, I am able to catalog the information efficiently and understand it in a broader context. I can't recommend these videos enough. I want more quality documentaries like these produced!!",1324080000,,531,4.977528089887641
3140220,5,B00153ZQY6,"Sort of a soapy drama, in my opinion, very entertaining, but science takes a distant back seat by my opinion.  It's a grand entertainment and introduction to the history of earth life.

The section about ""cavemen"" is far more drama than science.  Still worthy as an insight into human existance.

I'd've wanted more science but I must say it is worth buying esprcially for kids who enjoy dinosaurs.",1321660800,,398,4.8088235294117645
3140221,5,B00153ZQY6,"I watched this entire series with my two boys (3 and 7) and they LOVED it.  It's presented like a nature documentary and covers everything from the beginning of life on Earth to the rise of modern humans.  It obviously can't get into detail about everything and skips a bunch of stuff, but it's a really fun, entertaining and informational watch (I had no idea scorpions used to be giant and originally came from the ocean and were one of the first land creatures!).  I imagine some of the details have to be guessed at (things that wouldn't be evident from fossil records, behaviors are probably extrapolated from related creatures living now), but that's fine by me.

The CG is excellent (I was worried it wouldn't hold up - I think Walking With Dinosaurs is the oldest in the collection and you can tell the CG is a little less sophisticated in that one - but overall it's totally believable) and it's very entertaining - for kids and grown-ups alike.  I'd have watched it even without the kids (were watching it a second time now).",1314921600,,1035,4.572972972972973
3140222,5,B00153ZQY6,"I'm a student in college who saw this when I was little and still remembers how moved she was by the Walking with Dinosaurs documentary. The bonus here is that I get all five of the BBC prehistoric documentaries, which was enough incentive for me. Plus the price was good for 6 DVDs. I definitely recommend this to anyone slightly fascinated by dinosaurs.",1304553600,,355,4.650793650793651
3140223,5,B00153ZQY6,my kids love everything about dinosaurs and this is the best collection thah I have found...walking with dinosaurs its simply amazing,1300147200,,133,5.380952380952381
3140224,5,B00153ZQY6,"Contains a wealth of a DVD collection with episodes spanning the beginning of life on Earth through the rise of the cavemen.  CGI is nicely done mixing in with real locations.  Stories are well told, plenty of beasties, and it keeps my 4-year-old's rapt attention.  I've seen the episodes a dozen times, but I still look up from my book during certain segments.

I think we've burned out the ""Big Al"" DVD...an entire disc/episode devoted to the birth, life and death of an allosaurus.

The Walking With Dinosaurs DVD is far and away his favorite, featuring several 30-40 minute episodes spanning the Triassic to late Cretaceous interactions of dinosaurs, insects, plantlife and early mammals.

Walking with Pre-historic beasts is just excellent as well, these critters don't get as much attention as the dinos, but each episode is very well done.

My only complaint would be the audio...it's 2-channel stereo, not Dolby 5.1.  Small complaint for an otherwise excellent collection.",1292630400,4,980,5.119496855345912

There is of coarse a lot of people that are going to have there own opinions on what happened at the beginning of time and how earth shaped out to be what it is today but when it comes down to it nobody is ever going to know for sure 100%.  Although this colaboration of videos is amazing and takes you on a ride through history.  Its not just a lot of well educated people speaking into a camera about what they think happened but a bunch of excellect CG reanactment of what creature and enviorments may have been like and looked like why back when.  It catches your attention and keeps it. Reasons are given how people came across why they think this is what happened and how everything just kept changing and changing.  Creatures that could be looked on as true monster roaming our earth and ones that are still around today. There is so much to see the best thing to do is just to watch it yourself.  I highly recommend this series not just for adults but children will be caught up into it as well.",1275609600,5,1357,4.429718875502008
3374598,5,B00153ZQY6,"I purchased Prehistoric Earth, a Natural History, which is a 6 disc set, a ""Walking With"" Collection because it contained all of the really important discs in the evolutionary series from the beginning of life to man.  Disc 1 is Before the Dinosaurs; Disc 2 is Walking with Dinosaurs; Disc 3 is Allosaurus plus extras; Disc 4 is Prehistoric Earth; Disc 5 is Walking with Prehistoric Beasts; Disc 5 is the Making of Walking with Prehistoric Beasts; and Disc 6 is Walking with Cavemen.

There were other collections entitled Walking With, but they were incomplete.  Prehsitoric Earth is the only collection that gives you the whole big picture.

The series was well done, and the recreations were based on scientific and physical evidence.

I recommend this collection to those who want to see the whole big picture.",1272067200,51,814,4.912408759124087

3374601,5,B00153ZQY6,"This is an excellent series for introducing people to prehistoric life, and is beautiful in the way it envisions what life may once have been like.

Be forewarned that there are numerous artistic liberties taken with the facts in this film.  It frequently shows animals interacting that never lived together, though most of the time animals LIKE those pictured lived together.

So, it's not a hyper-accurate scientific documentary, but it's illuminating, and gives people a lot to think about.  I find that, for my schoolkids, the information is ""accurate enough"" and that many times they become interested in the material and learn more deeply about the information in the film on their own.",1257120000,25,692,5.097345132743363

3374604,1,B00153ZQY6,this is a fiction story advertised and sold as a non-fiction fact.... the narrator makes only subtle hits to this fact. when paying as much as this film was and expecting a non-fiction story i got robbed. this item should be categorized with movie as fiction. i was offended as to the way the narrator made constant remarks throwout the story that this is a factual story that it had to be this way or that because of this and that when we all know no one has any true knowledge or facts of this time era. the only thing i found nice in this story was the filmography had some very nice nature scenes. i would not rec amend this story to anyone i would rec amend to watch a story like Jurassic park first.,1234396800,3,705,4.1911764705882355
3374605,5,B00153ZQY6,"Reading Richard Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"" parallel with watching episodes of this awesome vdieo series (not intentionally) really was a moving experience.  I knew halfway through TSG I would never look at humans the same way again, and was awstruck by the awesome power of evolution in relation to the age of the earth.  I was curious how accurate this video series would be, but it is very accurate.  It covers almost all aspects of evolutionary theory including animal aggression, kin altruism and of course the evolutionary adaptations that various species have gone through in their millions of years of existence.  This is worth the money you pay because there are plenty of hours of video and each ""period"" is covered from the earliest sea animals through the dinosaurs to land animals and humans.  The video is all computer generated, obviously, since no video footage could possibly exist for our ancestors (did I even need to say that? haha), but it's well made.  It isn't very cheesy at all.  I highly recommend this video series for anyone interested in the theory of evolution and behavior of these fascinating animals...our distant relatives!

I realize that most of what we watch about dinosaurs can be supposition, but at least support your ideas.  The older boys (ages 6 and 7) like to watch these.

3374699,2,B00153ZQY6,"I've only seen the first two DVDs, but since I'm unlikely to watch the rest will report anyway.

First, the good: The animals are well done and the animations are generally pretty good. The animals' shapes, methods of movement, etc., all seem to be based on sound scientific input. Coloration and markings are of course speculative but mostly seem appropriate. Very nice, especially for TV.

Second, the bad: Most of the information on behavior and survival strategies is made up out of whole cloth. ""These creatures were cannibals,"" ""...hid from predators by hiding in piles of dung,"" ""...had specialized poison glands,"" and so forth. These are not just speculations, since they are based on no evidence at all. They are out-and-out inventions. Meanwhile Mr. Branagh's narration rolls on with no cautions whatever, as if they were the considered pronouncements of hordes of wise paleontologists. I'd say this makes up more than three-quarters of the narration. Beware!

Second, the bad again: Each episode ""tells a story"" -- a struggle for a water hole, babies surviving after birth, etc. But the plotting and storylines are slack and uninvolving. Boring. I fell asleep in disc 2. Animal Planet does it a lot better.

I was very disappointed in this series, which I was really looking forward to watching.",1346544000,8,1306,5.06046511627907

3374715,5,B00153ZQY6,"I'm a huge fan of Walking With Dinosaurs and all the other movies of the series (Walking With Monsters, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, Allosaurus, and Walking With Cavemen).  Most people who would be looking at this collection would already know what the series is about, but I'll speak briefly on it for newcomers.  Basically, all these films are faux nature documentaries.  When I say ""faux"" I mean to say that the narrative follows various extinct creatures around and describes them in a style similar to live action nature documentaries (such as the videos done by David Attenborough).  Obviously, they couldn't really follow a real dinosaur around, so the series does include some speculation that is presented as fact (because it would sound really awkward with their premise if we were watching ""real"" dinosaurs and they starting saying things like ""we think they may have done this"").  Still, the films do include a lot of good information and are highly entertaining.  This is a great series for either kids who are interested in dinosaurs or adults who still love watching dinosaur themed nature documentaries.  Anyway, Walking With Monsters covers the period of time before dinosaurs evolved, Walking With Dinosaurs covers the beginning and end of the dinosaur periods, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts covers the mammals that came after the dinosaurs, and Walking With Caveman covers the early human ancestors.  I'm less fond of Walking with Cavemen (just because it interests me less, but it's still good).

Anyway, since I love this series, I've been looking for ages for a Walking With... Collection that actually includes ALL of the materials from the series.  I've found several in the past (The Ultimate Walking With... Collection, The Complete Walking With... Collection) and despite their impressive names (such as having the word ""complete"" in their title), none of them actually included all the special features or even all of the series.  Prehistoric Earth: A Natural History is the first collection to actually include everything - all the episodes and all the special features.  The only thing that isn't included in this collection is the Nigel Marvin spinoff series Chased By Dinosaurs.

Lastly, let's talk about the actual packaging.  I'm very pleased to say that the dvd box is very nicely designed.  It's surprisingly thin and space efficient for a collection that has so many DVDs.  I'm also pleased to say that the dvd holding cases are arranged a lot like a book - you can just flip through the plastic ""pages"" that each hold a conveniently labeled DVD.  The holders work well and are simple to use.  The flip out front cover also has all the DVDs listed with a description of what's in each one, including listing the special features.  Overall, I'm thoroughly pleased with the design.  So, if you are interested in getting this whole series, you'd do well to ignore all those other collections and just go straight for this one.  Also, you may be interested in checking out Chased by Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Park (Nigel Marvin's spin-off series based on the Chased By Dinosaurs spinoff show).",1324857600,19,3132,5.042718446601942
3374716,5,B00153ZQY6,"I feel that the education provided in the public school system (at least in my experience) with regard to the history of life on Earth is entirely inadequate, and is often flagrantly absent. These videos are captivating. This is an area of learning where seeing images can really be helpful. Now, when I read about a given prehistoric time period, I am able to catalog the information efficiently and understand it in a broader context. I can't recommend these videos enough. I want more quality documentaries like these produced!!",1324080000,,531,4.977528089887641
3374717,5,B00153ZQY6,"Sort of a soapy drama, in my opinion, very entertaining, but science takes a distant back seat by my opinion.  It's a grand entertainment and introduction to the history of earth life.

The section about ""cavemen"" is far more drama than science.  Still worthy as an insight into human existance.

I'd've wanted more science but I must say it is worth buying esprcially for kids who enjoy dinosaurs.",1321660800,,398,4.8088235294117645
3374718,5,B00153ZQY6,"I watched this entire series with my two boys (3 and 7) and they LOVED it.  It's presented like a nature documentary and covers everything from the beginning of life on Earth to the rise of modern humans.  It obviously can't get into detail about everything and skips a bunch of stuff, but it's a really fun, entertaining and informational watch (I had no idea scorpions used to be giant and originally came from the ocean and were one of the first land creatures!).  I imagine some of the details have to be guessed at (things that wouldn't be evident from fossil records, behaviors are probably extrapolated from related creatures living now), but that's fine by me.

The CG is excellent (I was worried it wouldn't hold up - I think Walking With Dinosaurs is the oldest in the collection and you can tell the CG is a little less sophisticated in that one - but overall it's totally believable) and it's very entertaining - for kids and grown-ups alike.  I'd have watched it even without the kids (were watching it a second time now).",1314921600,,1035,4.572972972972973
3374719,5,B00153ZQY6,"I'm a student in college who saw this when I was little and still remembers how moved she was by the Walking with Dinosaurs documentary. The bonus here is that I get all five of the BBC prehistoric documentaries, which was enough incentive for me. Plus the price was good for 6 DVDs. I definitely recommend this to anyone slightly fascinated by dinosaurs.",1304553600,,355,4.650793650793651

3374721,5,B00153ZQY6,"Contains a wealth of a DVD collection with episodes spanning the beginning of life on Earth through the rise of the cavemen.  CGI is nicely done mixing in with real locations.  Stories are well told, plenty of beasties, and it keeps my 4-year-old's rapt attention.  I've seen the episodes a dozen times, but I still look up from my book during certain segments.

I think we've burned out the ""Big Al"" DVD...an entire disc/episode devoted to the birth, life and death of an allosaurus.

The Walking With Dinosaurs DVD is far and away his favorite, featuring several 30-40 minute episodes spanning the Triassic to late Cretaceous interactions of dinosaurs, insects, plantlife and early mammals.

Walking with Pre-historic beasts is just excellent as well, these critters don't get as much attention as the dinos, but each episode is very well done.

My only complaint would be the audio...it's 2-channel stereo, not Dolby 5.1.  Small complaint for an otherwise excellent collection.",1292630400,4,980,5.119496855345912

The other 3 series were simply fantastic, but the last one was simply awful!  I certainly feel that I got my money's worth from the other parts of the set though.  ""Walking with Cavemen"" is poorly done and is unnecessarily inappropriate for kids (a lot of nudity).  We chose to watch PBS Nova's ""Becoming Human"" series instead, though it was repetitive and a bit dry.",1475798400,,523,4.777777777777778
