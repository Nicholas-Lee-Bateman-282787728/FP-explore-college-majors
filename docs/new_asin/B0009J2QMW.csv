If you've watched the powerful and inspirational TV Smith documentary 'We Who Wait' by Jamie Palmer, on the BBC or You Tube, you will have witnessed the creation of a legend.

TV Smith is the living embodiment of true punk attitude and pure energy. Each new album is more infectious and creative than the last and his live shows are an unstoppable force of power, purpose and passion.

So how and when did TV Smith merge his Adverts punk rock core with the gifted singer-songwriter troubadour? TV did it live on stage at Blackpool HiTS Punk Rock Festival. It's all captured on this wonder full DVD. Armed with nothing but pure guts and an acoustic guitar TV birthed a legend. The crowd of punks, old and new, watched on in gaping mouthed awe.

One chord? So much more.

A Wonder? Most definitely.

A DVD to watch over and over and over again.

""This one's for us.""

Did he get any better? The Not In My Name bonus track shows why TV is the living imbodiment of continuous improvement.

The TV Smith live experience is not a 'gig' it's a show.

Catch the show live this year and watch the day it all came together on One Chord Wonder.

Bloody splendid.",1402099200,,1192,4.472222222222222
