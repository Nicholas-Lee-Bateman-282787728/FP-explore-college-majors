3715183,5,B001JQ31LO,"Having grown up watching the Smurfs, I missed them all these years they were discontinued.  Not sure why this very cartoon I loved had to be discontinued.  As soon as the film came out, my friends (who are also fellow Smurf fans) and I supported the film on opening night, Friday July/29/2011.  We watched the 9:15pm show in Edwards Stadium 12 Theater in Brea, CA.  I thoroughly enjoyed my very first 3D film in my local theater in Brea, CA.  This was in a downtown area, so it was very conviently located; both my friends and I loved the movie from the beginning to the end.  The three of us were the last ones to leave the theater while everyone was already gone.  We love the Smurfs THIS BIG.  Anyway, they had to twist the original storyline a bit to make a more dramatic story out of the Smurfs, and the 3D effects were logical along with the storyline.  I'm very picky once it comes to a movie as I would never pay full price for a movie; I've seen how much movie prices have gone up since when it was only $4 back in the days....  I'd most always wait for it to become cheaper to watch, and I would not just dare watch ANY movie.  Yet I chose this as my very 1st. 3D experience because I knew it was my type of movie.  Alas!!  I'd go back once it gets cheaper cuz I don't think I can afford $15 for a 3D movie that many times even though I loved it.  Both the actor+actress did a great job in the film throughout.  Since I'm not to spoil the movie for further customers who want to support it, as they should, I feel ya'll should give it a shot.  This film kept me laughing from the opening of the movie to the closing.  I was drawn with the Smurfs; it was refreshing to hear Katy Perry's voice as Smurfette; Smurfette took on a larger role in this film version and some of you would be surprised to find out what she CAN actually do if you gave The Smurfs film version a shot.  George Lopez was even one of the male Smurfs....can't remember exactly which Smurf because the End Credits rolled up too quickly~One of my friends made a comment, but I can't recall now.  I was going for Katy Perry as Smurfette and Neil Patrick as the main actor, so this movie made my past weekend Smurfabulous!!!!  You'll miss out if you don't support the Smurfs' successful return.  From being a huge Smurf fan, I've started collecting all the Smurfs' toys now starting with Brainy as I just found out that McDonalds is supporting this film...Currently staring at Brainy (holding up a phone) as I'm writing this review.  They are just so cute, and they say ""Smurf"" w/every word!!!  I believe that this film was and STILL IS Smurfacular!!!!",1312070400,3,2628,4.296747967479675
3715184,1,B001JQ31LO,"Sometimes despite your best efforts a movie you just know is going to be an awful experience is somehow worse than you imagined even though you tried to talk yourself into thinking it might not be so bad. ""Oh, this actor and/or actress is in it. Hopefully I'll still be able to enjoy their role in this monstrosity,"" is what you say to yourself. It turns out to be all for nothing and even though that person you admire is in it, you're just left wondering why they're a part of something so horrendous to begin with. The Smurfs is such a movie and I can almost guarantee you that you haven't seen anything as bad as this all year.

The smurfs live in Smurf Village in another universe where magic actually exists. These little blue creatures are about seven inches tall that can sing, dance, talk, live in mushrooms, and are massively annoying all day long. The evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria) is obsessed with capturing the smurfs in order to obtain their essence to become the most powerful wizard in the universe. During the festival of the blue moon, Clumsy (voiced by Anton Yelchin) accidentally leads Gargamel to Smurf Village. Amongst the confusion while they're fleeing Gargamel's onslaught, they accidentally stumble onto a portal to our universe as Gargamel follows in hot pursuit. Unfortunately for them, our moon never turns blue so they must rely on the assistance of Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and Grace Winslow (Jayma Mays); a couple who's expecting their first child and who are going through some troubles of their own.

If you weren't a fan of the original Smurfs cartoon, then you probably won't have any reason to actually sit through this thing. Speaking as someone who isn't a fan of anything Hanna-Barbera related, taking one for the team or biting the bullet doesn't even begin to describe the unfortunate displeasure I experienced throughout this cinematic miscarriage. The Smurfs does nothing but make a repetitive, never-ending effort to rub its audience nose in the fact that it's trying to be cute. It can't just show something cute and move on. It's basically shoving cuteness down your throat without asking in a rather obnoxious and extremely forceful fashion.

As if purely tolerating these tiny, blue kumquats wasn't enough, the movie makes it a point to rub salt in the wound before dousing it with lemon and plunging your exposed injury into a bucket of bleach. There's a Rock Band scene where Neil Patrick Harris plays the game with The Smurfs and they decide to add their own lyrics to Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way."" Imagine the song with all the lyrics replaced with stuff about sunshine, kilts, intelligence, being angry, blue skin, and ""smurf"" every three words or so. I recommend not getting nachos before seeing this. You'll want to pour the hot, scolding nacho cheese into your eye sockets just to make the torture on-screen be a little less painful.

Looking at the movie from a critic's perspective doesn't even help matters. It shows you all the main plot points in a vision Papa Smurf has at the beginning of the movie, so you basically know what's going to happen long before you even get there. You probably already have a solid idea of what the movie is just by seeing the TV spots alone. There's also another scene where Gargamel is in prison in our universe. He has a conversation with a moth. He doesn't use magic as he doesn't even have anything on him at the time other than an orange jumpsuit. He talks to this moth and convinces it to break him out of prison. How, you might ask? With about a million flies. Flies break Gargamel out of prison. All family movies have to include some sort of bodily fluid in them anymore. Crude humor is apparently the only way you can reach a younger audience these days. So I hope you like cat vomit and a grown man digging through a vomitous pile for a few strands of hair.

Is there anything actually decent about this movie? If you've read this far, you're probably thinking that. There is, actually. The 3D effect is actually utilized really well. Smurfs are constantly jumping in your face and when they're not random objects are flying at you thanks to Gargamel's magic. There's a scene at the very beginning of the movie where two smurfs are riding birds. That scene is pulled off incredibly well as the birds twist and turn in the air. The perspective, positioning of the camera, and the way we seem to follow their every move makes that thirty second sequence work really well. Neil Patrick Harris is probably the least offensive part of the movie, but that isn't saying a whole lot. There's actually some really talented people buried in the cast. Unfortunately they're so smothered in smurfberries that you probably won't even notice them.

The Smurfs is the first movie I've ever actually physically ran out of as soon as it was over. It is downright offensive with how cute and corny it is. With an overly predictable storyline, ridiculous plot points, and some of the lamest material to ever hit the big screen, anything remotely good in the film is immediately erased by the overwhelming wave of forcefed cutesy garbage. It's like having an entire jar of Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme crammed down your throat. If you suddenly have the urge to see this movie, stay home and drink a bottle of Drano instead. I promise you'll have a better time.",1311984000,9,5354,4.726980728051392
3715185,3,B001JQ31LO,"When trying to escape Gargamel (Hank Azaria), a small group of smurfs (Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Grouchy, Brainy, Clumsy and Gutsy) stumble into a magic portal that transports them to NYC. There they meet Patrick Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris) and his pregnant wife Grace (Jayma Mays) and....give Patrick the practice he needs to be a father ""I'm serious!.""
  While the Smurfs need a blue moon to get home and Gargamel ""who followed them to NYC"" is closely catching up to them. Can they warm up Patrick to the idea of having a kid ""I'm serious"" and also escape the wrath of Gargamel ?
  The first 10 minutes ""or less"" are like the show and have the Smurf Village, then the ingenious ""being sarcastic"" screenwriter J. David Stem came up with the idea to transport the smurfs to NYC. He also gave us a Scottish smurf named Gusty Smurf (Alan Cummings) that wasn't even in the show and him being in the movie doesn't even make sense when they are all related and no one else is Scottish. Smurfs being used for an upcoming father to warm up to father hood...is also pretty lame.
  As a fan of the show, I was surprisingly amused by a lot of the jokes though, like how they poke fun at how the smurfs use the word smurf...to describe everything. Gargamel's cat Asriel also supplies some laughs, while the movie has enough heart and charm to be one of the better films based on a cartoon series. Still, I have to ask myself, ""who the smurf! came up with that horrible plot!"", oh yeah, J. David Stem. I guess he was watching Enchanted while writing the script and thought ""wow that same exact story will work for the Smurfs!."" What the Smurf was he thinking!! I heard 2 sequels are planned and I really hope they just leave the smurfs in the Smurf Village, we don't need them transported to...Iraq ""oops I just gave Hollywood there next big idea.""",1311897600,2,1835,4.495495495495495

3715212,1,B001JQ31LO,"The premise of this film is good versus evil. However, both Papa Smurf and Gargamel use witchcraft and spells to see the future, have visions, create potions, etc. This is all done similar to the witch in Snow White. While some people believe that it is harmless, Galatians 5 warns us that acts of the flesh such as witchcraft keep us from inheriting the kingdom of God.
Gargamel uses a potion to turn an older woman young. The transformation is shown on the screen, including her breasts and buttocks lifting and getting firmer. Gargamel is told that if he can produce enough of the potion to sell to other women, the world will worship you. Gargamel summons a moth to get eagles to help him escape from prison. The moth brings back a hoard of flies. As the flies lift him in the air, it really becomes a very disturbing scene.
Smurfette walks over a heater vent wearing a dress similar to Marilyn Monroe and the dress flies up. Gargamel has champagne at lunch and grabs a waiters ice bucket and relieves himself in the bucket.
There is violence, some of it slapstick. Gargamel gets hit with a tree trunk. Gargamel destroys the Smurfs village. Clumsy is always running into Smurfs, smacking Smurfs, knocking Smurfs over, and just being clumsy.
Gargamel uses terms like thank the gods several times. The word smurf is used as a noun, verb, adjective and adverb. It is used throughout the movie to replace expletives. Phrases like smurf me and son of a smurf are used. The only actual swear word was d-mn.
POSITIVE CONTENT: The couple the Smurfs stay with are married and have a good relationship. They appear to care about one another and are kind to each other. This is so rare in movies today and it was refreshing to see.
The Smurfs are all defined by their names. They live out their existence by their names. Until someone else believes in Clumsy, he is only Clumsy. Satan wants us to believe that we are not whole. We are clumsy, fearful, lazy, etc. We simply do not measure up. That is not how God sees us. Ephesians 2:10 says For we are Gods handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. When we believe what God says about us, we can begin to live the life He intended for us.
My 6 year old would not watch this movie. He was afraid every time Gargamel appeared. I tell you this as a warning. Most children will not be bothered, but if you have a child that does get scared by the villains then do not see this movie. The music played every time Gargamel appears on the screen is very ominous.
While the movie was cute, I do worry that exposure to white magic does desensitize children to the real dangers of witchcraft. For this reason alone, I cannot recommend this movie. However, without the witchcraft, there is still plenty in this movie to warn parents to stay away.

morning television shows during the 1980s.  Living in their Smurf Village,
these tiny blue creatures represented individual human characteristics
such as Brainy, Clumsy, Grouchy Handy, etc.  Each of these names
exemplified their own personalities.  Each day, the Smurfs would engage
in some sort of work activity, singing their Smurf songs,  while avoiding
capture from the evil Wizard known as Gargamel.

I have very fond memories of The Smurfs animated morning show.
I was in my early 20s and working in a local video store.  Every
morning my co-workers and I would have an entire row of cable-driven
displays tuned to the NBC show.  It's sort of sad that with all the fond
nostalgia I have about that original cartoon series, that I found myself
fidgeting through this rather clumsy mixture of animation and live action
set in the city of Manhattan.

As the film opens, the Smurfs are readying for their annual Festival
of the Blue Moon.  However, it's not before long that Gargamel (played
by live Hank Azaria) and his cat, Azrael, is hot on the trails of a lone
Smurf who lead them to their hidden village.  The Smurfs manage to
escape into a vortex that brings them to the modern-day city of
Manhattan where they become entangled with marketing executive
Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and his pregnant wife Grace (Jayma Mays).
With Gargamel in hot pursuit to reap the Smurfs of their ""essence,""
our blue heroes must quickly find a way to return home again.

The film features the voice talents of Jonathan Winters (Papa Smurf)
Katy Perry (Katy Perry) and Alan Cummings (Gutsy) who all do an
admirable job with their roles.  However, director Raja Gosnell brings
nothing fresh to this story which seems to be rehashes of familiar
live/animated films.  In fact, instead of catering to its child audience,
the film aims completely over their heads with jokes related to adult
movies (Braveheart, Brokeback Mountain) and cameos by aging stars
that will go completely unnoticed by the younger generation.

Sony has done a magnificent job with this 1080p transfer that looks
eye-popping in every way thanks to the high level of detail in both
the animation and cityscape.  The level of sharpness and clarity is
outstanding. Because of this, the film lends itself to having an
""open window"" effect where you feel as if you can reach out into
the picture itself. Without purposely paying attention to it, one easily
notices the intricate details of the animation such as eyebrow hairs or
clothing.  The balance of color and its textures really bring the film to
life.

Unfortunately, watching The Smurfs in 3D is only a mediocre
experience.  True, the process does add depth between the
characters and backgrounds, but the amount of separation is
more minimal here than most other 3D fare.  This is disappointing
as all the wonderful scenes shot in Manhattan, particularly within
Times Square, would have looked far more stunning had there been
more perceived depth.  Additionally, with a multitude of props at
their disposal, the filmmakers did very little to engage their young
audience.  Rarely is anything projected outwards.  If anything, there
is a point in the film where Gargamel's shoes seem to poke themselves
forward.  A scene at the beginning of the film where the Smurfs
get sucked into the vortex provides some briefly impressive pullback
3D effects that involve flying leaves, but other than that, I can't say
that I found this found this to be an involving experience.

One of the most spectacular aspects of the 3D transfer is that
despite the fact the film has several dark scenes where ghosting
would usually rear its ugly head -- there is none to be seen here.

The Smurfs is certainly more immersive sonically than it is visually.
The film's 5.1 DTS-MA soundtrack immediately wins the viewer over
with its wide dynamics and highly active surrounds that will keep heads
turning as character voices move from one channel to the other.
Dialogue is clear, remaining mainly in the center channel and the action
sequences are accented with a nice level of LFE support.

The Smurfs arrives as a 2-Disc combo with 3D and 2D feature encased
in lenticular slip-cover packaging.  Extras include Deleted & Extended
Scenes, 2 Commentary Tracks, Blu-pers, Happy Music Montage, Going
Gargamel, Meet the Cast, Progression Reels and The Smurfs: Comic
Book to the Big Screen featurette.

There are included 3D trailers for Arthur Christmas and Cloudy With
Meatballs.  However, the real treat here is the trailer for the upcoming
claymation film, The Pirates, which sports some outrageously cool
3D effects including the words, ""The following preview has been
approved...."" moving out directly towards the audience.  If you are
going to remember anything about this Blu-ray disc, it will be that
particular trailer.

Whether I recommend one purchases The Smurfs in 3D is going
to depend on the who will ultimately be viewing the film.  This is
the kind of stuff that kids are going to eat up, and for that reason,
I suspect that this title will do quite well on Blu-ray.  For adults,
however, there is nothing appealing about this film whatsoever
including the 3D which is average at best.  If only the filmmakers
would have engaged the audience with all the film's cool props I would
have been far more forgiving of this film.",1453075200,,5460,4.944140197152246

This should be cataloged as ""misleading advertising"" and would have my money back. Who is gonna respond for this unforgivable mistake.
I don't have to waste more money send it back neither.

2) For being a brand new sealed product is strange that two of the four discs on the box have many many little scratches on the playing side like if someone have already use them and even harm them a little bit, besides the box was wrapped only with a light plastic wrapper that makes me wonder if this is really a brand new sealed product !!!!!

The most interesting character in this movie is Gargamel, and the second most interesting is his cat.  All the frantic Smurf activity I found a little irritating.

While the characters are the same, the Smurfs are almost unrecognizable from the show of my youth! Its just another reminder of how far technology has come! They look amazing in Blu-Ray. They came alive on the screen and my kids and I really enjoyed watching this together.

I wasn't sure how my four and five year olds would feel about it not being completely a cartoon. The beginning mostly is so they were completely absorbed but when the humans entered, they did lose a little bit of interest and kind of wandered in and out of the room. I actually sat through the whole thing because I wanted to see what would happen!

I loved Neil Patrick Harris in this and have always enjoyed his acting. Gargamel was perfectly cast with Hank Azaria and was exactly what I imagined him to be. My daughter loved Azrael even though he was a mean kitty. They really captured the essence of the original characters with their human (and animal) counterparts.

As an unexpected bonus, there was also a Smurfs Christmas movie included. It was so cute and original and my daughter has made this her new favorite holiday flick!

While the human side didn't interest my kids as much as the lovable Smurfs, they still ask to re-watch it and are ready to go see Smurfs 2!",1384646400,,1456,4.397769516728625

3715467,5,B001JQ31LO,"Remakes of 80's TV shows, especially kids shows rarely are good on the big screen, so I didn't expect much when I sat down to watch The Smurfs.  However I was pleasantly surprised, and it wasn't the comedy acting from Neil Patrick Harris, Hank Azaria or even any of the Smurfs that had me thinking after a minute or two, hey I'm really enjoying this, but the antics of a cat.  I don't even really like cats but I've never seen a cat character like Azrael on the screen.  It was just damn funny every scene it was in, especially when highlighting the incompetence of Gargamel.  I'm not saying Neil Patrick Harris or Hank Azaria didn't do a good job either.  Both did, but it was Azriel that outperformed them all and why I would recommend this to others.  I do remember the cat being in the cartoon I watched as a kid but nothing specific, so this CGI cat's screen presence on the screen was something I didn't anticipate.

The Smurfs casting made a good selection of actors to fill the non Smurf parts, taking actors who were part of the biggest shows on TV, like these shows or hate them, Glee (Jayma Mays), How I Met Your Mother (Neil Patrick Harris) and Modern Family (Sofia Vergara) dominated the ratings in 2011 when this movie was released.  Throw in Hank Azaria (The Simpsons) and the voice of Katy Perry as Smurfette and it surprising that this movie didn't do better in cinemas.  But I guess it's the 80's TV show remake as a movie curse as I mentioned before.

Although the movie was predictable in every scene, it was still fun viewing.  Gargamel's nose was obviously fake and the Smurfs didn't entirely look like they weren't superimposed on top of real world footage but that's okay in a fun film.  I liked how they made fun of the staples of the cartoon like the fact they use Smurf as a verb in every sentence.  Smurfette is asked how it's possible she's the only girl in the village but gets distracted before answering other than Gargamel made her, I would have liked them to have answered that one.

I'd recommend this film to others, especially those with pet cats due to Azriel's mocking actions and fits of laughter at its hapless master.",1378252800,,2159,4.474489795918367
3715468,4,B001JQ31LO,"My 8 year old LOVES this movie.  It is cute, clean and has good characters for the kids.

3715474,4,B001JQ31LO,"Raja Gosnell (Scooby Doo, Yours, Mine and Ours) directs this sequel and believe it or not, this film is just as good and in some parts better than his the first film which he also directed. Now if you were a fan of the Smurfs before or really enjoyed the first one, this film has everyone back plus a few extra interesting characters and most importantly, a really good story about family!

Yes, the arch nemesis Gargamel is back and has never more creatively being played by Hank Azaria (The Simpsons, Godzilla) who is masterfully reprising his role and obviously having  a lot of fun doing it too. You see Gargamel wants to harness the magic power of the Smurfs to increase his wizardry powers to the point in which he can control the entire world. (Insert maniacal laugh here.) However, currently he is a now world-famous magician travelling around and  using what is very little left of his Smurf position. They all end up in Paris, France this time!

He ends up creating two new Smurf's that are greyish in color and require the magic Smurf liquid to survive and they are to be considered the `dark' side of what a Smurf can be. Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hallow, Monster) is the voice of Vexy, the spicy and nasty female version of Smurfette. Hackus, the fumbling, not-so-bright `dark' version of a Smurf is voiced by J.B. Smoove (SNL, Date Night).

Vexy kidnaps Smurfette who is once again amazingly voiced by Katie Perry (The Ugly Truth, Madagascar 3), under the orders of Gargamel and the adventure ensues! In his last screen performance, Jonathan Winters (The Flintstones, Davis Rules) just before his passing, again reprises his heartfelt role of Papa Smurf. Also back are the always moody Grumpy Smurf voiced by George Lopez (Rio, Valentine's Day), the never intended to do anything wrong - Clumsy Smurf voiced by Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fight Night), the proudly Scottish Gusty Smurf voiced by Alan Cummings (X2, Goldeneye) and we are introduced to the extremely narcissistic new blue Smurf, Vanity Smurf voiced by John Oliver (The Daily Show, The Love Guru).

Yes, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Doogie Houser) and Jayma Mays (Glee,Mall Cop) are back as the parents of Blu who is now 6 years old and is played by Jacob Tremblay (The Magic Ferret, Motive).  They are all eventually needed to help Papa Smurf find out where Gargamel has captured and imprisoned Smurfette. Neil does a wonderfully believable job as a father with issues with his own father and coping with being a father himself, is just not easy.

Now here's where the movie takes a turn for the absolute better. Its real story is about family and what children mean to their fathers. How communication can sometimes be miss-interpreted and as often is the case, sometime parents do things that appear cruel to their children in order to protect them. In the long run, love has no boundaries. How is his introduced?

Both Papa Smurf, Neil Patrick Harris and Neil's characters stepfather Victor, played wonderfully by Brendan Gleeson (Gangs of New York, Troy), all learn a valuable lesson of family and parenting. Again, it's extremely heartfelt and coupled with Smurfette learning about her new `sister' in Vexy, the film is a wonderful uplifting family treat. Forget Pacific Rim, see something you'll actually remember and feel good about! Smurf-tacular!",1377129600,,3345,4.864674868189807

The movie version looked interesting, so I bought the DVD.  The human characters were good, and the acting was good to, but the stars had to be the 6 little 7"" smurfs, that stole the show.  Granted I wanted the movie to be in the medieval times as the cartoon version, but the plot was interesting.  My only disappointment, New York,  WHY New York? but, Ok I digress. Anyway won't go into plot of movie.  Gargamel, Azreal, and the Smurfs stole the whole movie for me. Exciting, had a good moral for everyone in this movie. In it's funny brought the whole family devotion and importance in to being without being preachy. Saw another whole side of Smurfet that I never knew.  I always wondered why only one female smurf for 99 male smurfs.  OH WELL, story for amother day.  Anyway watch this movie, very enjoyable and a great lead-in to a sequel that I knew was coming.  The human actors were pretty good to not well known characters, but were talented enough to carry it thru.  Will be watching the sequel when it comes to DVD soon.",1375660800,,1174,4.3842592592592595

3715536,3,B001JQ31LO,"I admit I don't remember the Smurfs that much these days.  I haven't watched the cartoon in a good 25 years.  The only episode I can remember is the one where the sun would rapidly rise and set rather quickly.  What I *do* remember however, is the cartoon being much funnier than this failed attempt at a movie.

This is one of the rare times when implementing animated characters in a realistic setting doesn't work for me.  In this case, the Smurfs enter a portal as a way to escape an angry wizard and find themselves in Manhattan.  While there, they stumble upon an apartment where the character of Neil Patrick Harris and his pregnant wife are staying.  The Smurfs then go on an adventure around the city (while dragging Neil Patrick and his wife along) awaiting the next blue moon so they can all return home.

These Smurfs are really boring and unfunny.  Yes, I realize that being a 31-year old man, this movie isn't exactly intended for me.  However I really enjoy the Alvin & the Chipmunks movies.  These are really hilarious.  Not a single Smurf stands out to me other than the female one, and this is *only* because she's the only female of the bunch (and admittedly, kind of cute!)

I don't even remember an evil wizard guy named Gargamel with an orange cat from the cartoons.  This guy and his crossed-eyed cat chases the Smurfs around the city streets.  The problem is that this little adventure isn't a particularly interesting one.  The Smurfs mess up the home of Neil Patrick Harris, create chaos at the downtown mall and get all the children excited when the kids spot the Smurfs running around (and assume they're some kind of high tech toy upon seeing their realistic movements) and near the end all the other Smurfs get together as a way to take down the bad guy but... I never laughed once.  I never felt entertained once.

The segment with the Smurfs playing Guitar Hero with Neil Patrick Harris isn't the least bit funny to me and was seriously overdone and unnecessary.  In fact I consider Neil Patrick Harris completely unsuitable for this role.  He's much nastier and raw in his comedy performance usually (well I mean, in other films- obviously How I Met Your Mother is rather tame).  The only thing I really liked is the family's basset hound and this is only because I'm a fan of dogs (hounds and retrievers in particular).

Overall, I wasn't entertained.  Bland Smurf characters, average storyline, and bad movie overall.  Skip it.",1358985600,,2462,4.645833333333333

Even my kids were dissatisfied with the 3D and they are 7 and 5. Most of the 3D showed up right at the very end of the movie. If you are looking for a good family movie, this is it, but if you want a good family 3D movie this is not, try Madagascar 3 or The Lorax, both them were great!

However, if you're watching this movie because you loved the smurfs as a child, then don't bother... the movie = ""yuke"". The movie had a highly predictable story line, and flat characters. The majority of this film consisted of one line jokes, slap stick comedy, and simple story telling. Also, the movie had no strong magical flavor, or enchantement (as the tv show had had). The director/writers had a lot of material to work with (from the tv show/comic), but instead he/she used only bare basics, such as using smurfs, and that's about it. No REAL imagination or effort was put into this movie. If you grew up loving the smurfs as a child I wouldn't recommend watching this film. However, if you are the type of person who likes the garfield, and the chipmunk movies then you'll love this movie... which is nothing more then a watered down version of a classic cartoon.

3715586,4,B001JQ31LO,"Back in the late '50s, Belgian cartoonist Peyo created the comic strips featuring small blue fictional characters known as the Smurfs.  A big success in France, the Smurfs would receive various adaptations.

The first were in Belgium via TV animated shorts that were  created in 1961-1967, a few of the shorts would be featured in the 1965 in the black-and-white animation ""Les Adventures des Schtroumpfs"" and then followed by a 1976 animation titled ""La Flte &agrave; six schtroumpfs"" (The Smurfs and the Magic Flute) which would receive an English version that would inspire more full-length Smurf animated films.

But in America, where the Smurfs gained its popularity is through the 1981 animated TV series which was nominated many times for a Daytime Emmy Award and won the ""Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series"" for 1982-1983.  The animated series would broadcast on television through 1989.

In 1997, producer Jordan Kerner has been trying to get a ""Smurfs"" film created but it wasn't until 2002 when Peyo's heirs accepted Kerner's offer and people were able to get their first look at the film via leaked footage on the Internet in 2008.

And in 2011, the first live-action/CG Smurf film of a planned trilogy was released in theaters in 2011.  The film which was budgeted for $110 million received lackadaisical reviews from film critics but the film was popular among the younger viewers and earned over $559 million in the box office ensuring the film as a success for Columbia Pictures. It also helps that the film features all-star talent for the live-action scenes and the voice acting scenes including Neil Patrick Harris (""How I Met Your Mother""), Jayma Mays (""Glee), Hank Azaria (""The Simpsons""), Sofia Vergara (""Modern Family"") and Tim Gunn (""Project Runaway"").  For the voices of the Smurfs, a few of the talent featured are George Lopez, Katy Perry, Alan Cummings, Kenan Thompson, Fred Armisen, Paul Reubens to name a few.  And the film is directed by Raja Gosnell (""Big Momma's Hosue"", ""Scooby-Doo"", ""Never Been Kissed"") and a screenplay by J. David Stern (""Shrek 2', ""The Rugrats Movie""), David N. Weiss (""Shrek 2', ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"") and writing duo Jay Scherick and David Ronn (both wrote ""Zookeeper"", ""Guess Who"", ""Norbit"").

And now, ""The Smurfs"" will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on December 2nd.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

""The Smurfs"" is presented in 1:78:1 Anamorphic widescreen and English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital (and English-Audio Description Track).  If you want the best presentation of ""The Smurfs"", you definitely want to go for the Blu-ray release, especially the Blu-ray 3D release if you have a Blu-ray player and television set capable of 3D playback.  But for the DVD version, you can still see quite a bit of detail from the threaded caps that the Smurfs wear, the strands of hair on Smurfette's head to the pigmentation on the blue skin of the Smurfs.  Possibly not as detailed as the Blu-ray version but still visible on DVD.  For the most part, on DVD, the picture quality is very good.

As for audio, the audio features a lot of dialogue, music and also special effects for the action sequences.  On Blu-ray, the lossless audio will definitely take advantage of the surround channels but on DVD, the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is also pretty good as there is good amount of LFE during the bass-driven sequences, the music - may it be the Smurfs singing or even Neil and the Smurfs playing ""Guitar Hero Aerosmith"".  The Dolby Digital soundtrack sounds very good but on Blu-ray, you definitely want to go for that version if you want a more immersive soundtrack and to hear the ambiance much more clearly.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Smurfs"" come with the following special features:

  Find the Smurfs Game - Featuring a hide-and-seek remote control game in which you are shown a Smurf and with other Smurfs in the village, you need to find out where a certain smurf is hiding.
  Audio Commentary 1 - The first audio commentary features director Raja Gosnell who talks about the challenges of bringing the Smurfs to CG, the shooting process, scouting and shooting on location.
  Audio Commentary 2 - The second audio commentary features producer Jordan Kerner, writer J. David Stern, David N. Weiss , Jay Scherek, David Ronn and VFX Supervisor Richard Hoover.
  The Smurfs: Comic Book to the Big Screen - (8:16) Featuring the challenges in taking the Smurfs for a CG film, creating different personalities for each Smurf and more.
  Going Gargamel - (10:01) Hank Azaria talks about playing Gargamel and we see how much time it took to make the actor into Gargamel and behind-the-scenes footage and also the challenges of playing the role.
  Blu-Pers - (:26) Two very short bloopers.
  Happy Music Montage - (1:51) Short music montage of clips from the movie.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was a bit skeptical when I first saw the trailer for ""The Smurfs"" in the theater.  It's been a long time since I have watched the cartoon on television but I was a big fan of the animated series and owned several of the toys when I was younger.

And while the animated series is dear to me because I watched it from grade school and even when I was in high school, here we are decades later and now I have a child in grade school, who has become interested in ""The Smurfs"" not so much because of the animated series (which he has never seen) but primarily because he enjoys the iPad video game.

So, it's quite interesting how the younger generation have found about the Smurfs, may it be the video game or through the Happy Meal toys but needless to say, despite the big names attached to this live-action/CG film, my main interest is how much they writers strayed from the original storyline or in this case, from the cartoon.

And when it was all done, I can say that as a family film and a film for the children, it was a fun film!  My eight-year-old enjoyed it a lot and for me and the wife, I'm a bit more easy on family films especially ""The Smurfs"" because they are targeted for a younger demographic.  With that being said, my wife was turned off by the ""Guitar Hero"" scene and I admit, that was possibly the cheesiest part of the entire film.

But for me, there was a lot to love about the film.  First, I think it worked in the favor of producer Jordan Kerner that this film was made in 2011 versus 1997 or in the early 2000's because CG has developed a lot in the last decade and for the most part, I found the computer graphics to be very well-done.  Loved the detail on the skin of the Smurfs, loved the detail on the knit caps to the thorough planning on the color of the Smurfs to creating living beings via CG on the film (the special feature goes into details about how much the crew wanted the characters to come alive).

It helps to have popular TV talent such as Neil Patrick Harris, Sofia Vergara and Jayma Mays also involved with the film, especially the talent of Hank Azaria who is spectacular as voice talent for ""The Simpsons"" (and also the '90s ""Spider-Man"" animated series) but even before then, he was fun to watch on ""Mad About You"" and ""Friends"".  He did a fantastic job as Gargamel.  And of course, you have a lot of voice talent involved in this film from singer Katy Perry to a long list of talent which include Jonathan Winters, Alan Cummings, Fred Armisen, George Lopez, Kenan Thompson, Jeff Foxworthy, Wolfgang Puck to name a few.  And heck, you have voice acting legend Frank Welker (who also did the voice dub in the earlier Smurf's animated films and TV series as ""Hefty Smurf"") doing the voice of Azrael.

So, I appreciate the dedication of the crew honoring the original animated series and comic books but also giving new life to the characters for this live action/CG film.

With that being said, I know a major criticism by reviewers was that this film was ""too kiddy"" especially since it's a rated PG film, not rated G.  But for me, ""The Smurfs"" was originally conceived for children back in the late '50s, was targeted towards kids in the '80s and I never expected anything dark or low-beat for this film.  I was not expecting the writers to stray far off from the original storyline and expected a family film that would feature a lot of laughs and also cheesy moments (I sort of liken it to the live-action/CG animated ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" films).

Sure, Neil Patrick Harris and the Smurfs rockin' it to Aerosmith via ""Guitar Hero"" was possibly the lowest point of this film for me, but aside from those scenes...everything else was pretty fun and hilarious and for the most part, my son and I had fun watching it (although my wife wasn't into the film all that much).

As for the DVD release, the DVD release features a good amount of special features and commentary and the DVD does look good.  But if you want the best presentation in sound and audio, you want to go for the Blu-ray release, especially since it contains more special features than the DVD release.

Overall, for those who grew up watching ""The Smurfs"", the good news is that the writers did fans a service by not straying to far from the original concept.  Sure, there are some cheesy scenes but as a family film, I'm not going to be overly critical as this film was created for the kids.  And as a fan of the original animated TV series, I had a fun time watching it as well.

With the holidays coming up, if you are looking for a fun family film to keep the kids busy during Winter vacation or even during those long traveling commutes, I recommend give ""The Smurfs"" a try!",1335571200,2,9615,4.668842729970327

3715588,2,B001JQ31LO,"I can't rate this for kids separately, but I bet most kids under the age of 6 would watch this and be happy, so for that youngest age group I give FIVE STARS. For everyone above the age of 6 years, there isn't much here of interest. We watched this movie with a large age range. From young adult to 76 we all agreed there wasn't much to like. It's cute. Neil Patrick Harris was very cute. Jayma Mays, also very cute. The smurfs were, yes you guessed it, cute! You know, I think even Gargamel was cute. There were a lot of ""blue jokes"" for anyone looking, I'm sure we even missed a few. Other than that, I believe there was one non blue joke, and it involved a porter potty. So if you like off color (blue jokes) or toilet jokes, then it's not just a bunch of cute people running around. This felt like an old school smurfs t.v. episode from my childhood and it didn't seem to have grown up to fit the big screen. So basically, your kids will laugh but you will not, but still it's a cute movie. Did I mention it was cute?

The Christmas Carol short of the combo disc package was quite enjoyable. I think it was more universal and done well enough. You can never have too many grouchy Scrooges.",1334793600,,1193,4.1645021645021645

When I originally watched the movie, I thought it was cute and kinda fun so I took a shot with the 3D version.  Glad I did...the added depth did a lot for this film.  The 3D effect really brought the Smurfs to life and showed off the streets of Manhattan perfectly.  There were lots of nice 3D effects especially towards the end of the film.  Popouts were mostly at a minimum which is fine by me...3D can get gimmicky real fast.  Curiously, sometimes the humans seemed a bit cardboard cut-out but they really are there in service of the cute little blue guys (and gal).  That said, I still loved Neil Patrick Harris, Sofia Vergara from Modern Family and even the germ freak from Glee. I think Hank Azaria was GREAT as Gargamel....is there anything he can't do?!

3715605,4,B001JQ31LO,"Yep, this movie is exactly that...great for kids and incredibly silly/cute. The basic premise is that Gargamel and Azrael are ever on the hunt for Smurf's to G can extract the essence of the smurfs to fuel his wizardry. One thing leads to another and several Smurf's end up getting sucked through a portal of sorts and end up in modern day New York City, where they end up befriending Neil Patrick Harris and his pregnant wife, and begin the search for a way back to their own realm. Gargamel and Az of course follow the smurfs through the portal. Azaria plays Gargamel, and is acceptably over the top. Neil Patrick Harris is, well, pretty much the same as always. Charismatic, but pretty much the same basic personality as in all his movies, but far less a-holish than his character in 'How I Met Your Mother'. The Smurf's all all voiced by recognizable actors and pop icons, including Katy Perry (can you guess who she is?). The characters are all cute and likable, even Grouchy Smurf, lol. There's really nothing epic or enduring about this flick per se, but it really doesnt need to be all that. It simply is a modern day Smurf's tale. Your kids will most likely love it, and the adults will at worst tolerate it, and at best will enjoy it for its charm and quirkiness.

Part of the magic of ""The Smurfs"" cartoon was their little toadstool village and the land in which they lived. The movie sets the Smurfs in the modern world (pursued by Gargamel), and a lot of charm is lost as a result. They end up at Neil Patrick Harris's house where lots of slapstick hi-jinks ensue, and everyone learns their lessons. Kids under 8 will probably find this movie entertaining, but older kids who have already seen a few movies like this might find the plot and the jokes to be tired cliches.

Fans of the old-school smurfs will notice that these new Smurfs really don't act like the old ones.

There was only a code for Sony Movie Rewards inside, but that code is different from the Ultraviolet code.

After e-mailing Sony, I received a response that the code was on the back of the sticker on the clear plastic wrapping of the disc.  Fortunately, I still had the wrapping of both discs, and lo and behold, on the back of the sticker on the wrapping was the code.

So interestingly, the sticker on the clear plastic wrap states that the code is on the back, while the sticker on the disc case states the code is inside.  Nice contradiction, but more importantly, it's poor human factors/ergonomic packaging design that deviates from consumers' expectations.  When 99% of digital download codes (e.g. your iTune digital download codes and Ultraviolet digital download codes on Warner Bros. discs) are located on a sheet of paper inside the disc case, and you decide to put it on the outside along with a different sticker stating that it's on the inside, you are setting yourself up for headaches, Sony.",1325894400,2,1268,4.654708520179372

3715630,4,B001JQ31LO,"First of all let me say that as a 29 years old woman with no children I am not exactly the target audience for this movie so my opinions of it should be read by that in mind. Now when trailers for The Smurfs first begun to air the movie got allot of criticism for placing smurfs in modern New York City instead of the fantasy world where they belong. I to was a bit skeptical but I must say that I think the movie makers have done a good job and actually made the New York part fit. I used to watch The Smurfs cartoons when I was a little girl and I think that putting a non animated movie in that setting would be disturbing, this way they manage to not disturb the setting allot of people have fond childhood memories of and at the same time use some of these characters in a feature film.

The plot of the Smurfs is simple but it works. I found myself engaged in it and while it is simple enough for children to easily grasp it fits nicely together and have enough humor and structure to entertain adults as well. Basically the movie starts out animated and follow the smurfs preparing for a big party, unfortunately one thing leads to another and a handful of smurfs as well as the evil but pretty failed wizard Gargamel get sucked into a magical portal and end up in New York City. Now the smurfs have to find a way to get home, luckily they meet a young couple, a overworking advertisement man and his wife who helps them on. Gargamel however is still obsessed with smurfs and do his best to track them down with the help of not always working magic and his cat and hilarity ensues.

Now one complaint I have about The Smurfs is that the movie play it very safe, there is very few surprises in the plot, already from the first time we see the New York couple who befriends the smurfs and see that Patrick miss his wife's first ultrasound because of work we know he will learn that family is all that really matters, the first time we see the other smurfs be mean to Clumsy we know he will end up the hero of the story, and I am not spoiling anything here it is just that obious. Five minutes into the movie you know how it will end. That being said getting to that end is quite entertaining.

Both me and my hubby enjoyed The Smurfs, I think it is to predictable, but all in all this is a sweet, safe movie. I would call The Smurfs a true family flick as it is safe for the youngest kids, and older children and adults can also find something to enjoy about it. Technically this movie is solid, the actors do a good job, the animation on the smurfs themselves are good and music and sounds are quite ok. Now for me, even had I been six I think this would have been one of those movies you watch, enjoy and then forget about as it is just so predictable, but all in all I think that the movie makers have done a great job in bringing smurfs to the big screen. If you have children or you enjoy cute fairytale stories with allot of heart and a happy ending then I definitely recommend The Smurfs.",1325548800,2,3000,4.151202749140894

The cast is great and the animated smurfs are cute. But it didn't reinvigorate the same magic that the cartoon held. A few things bugged me, like the fact that they planted the smurfs into current-day NYC, the voices of the smurfs were not as easy to distinguish as in the cartoon, and while I love the cast, I didn't feel as though Neil Patrick Harris really connected with his little blue co-stars, although he did a fine job. Azrael the cat too is played by a real cat, with a few animations added and just ended up looking silly. I would have rather seen a movie completely in 3D animation, no live actors, and set in the smurf village and forest.

Instead I'm going to rip into Sony over the way they've implemented their version of Ultra Violet digital copy.

I'm no stranger to Ultra Violet digital copy.  My first experience with it was Universals version which was really cool, it gave me an Amazon download along with other cool stuff when I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboys-Aliens-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy-in-Blu-ray-Packaging/dp/B004EPYZSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboys & Aliens (Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>.  It was mostly smooth, some confusion since it was my first experience with it, but overall it was a positive experience.

Not with Sony.

First of all I found a code inside the Blu-Ray box that gave me Sony points, but every time I tried to create an account for the Ultra Violet copy (with Ultra Violet you have to create an account with each studio separately) I kept getting this error message:

An Error Was Encountered

A system error occurred. Please try again later or contact customer support. (848ecb5f-912f-43d2-a2dc-b06bad3b837b)

I figured hey, it's Christmas, the servers are overloaded due to an influx of Christmas time registration and no one is around to fix the issue, so give the admins a break.

I tried registering several times a day for the next several days.  Always the same error, even on Tuesday, I figured they should have it fixed by then.

So then I have a hunch, I start up my Windows XP virtual machine and try to create an account.  It works.  Instead of saying ""Go away Linux hippie!""  They say (848ecb5f-912f-43d2-a2dc-b06bad3b837b).

That's not cool.

I get the account created.  Turns out the code from INSIDE the box doesn't work for the movie.  I do some searching online, I find more than one account of someone throwing it away, turns out it was on a sticker ON THE CELLOPHANE. The very sticker you could pull off in the store with no one noticing and the movie would still be sealed.  My cellophane and sticker were thrown away in a bag full of snotty tissue days before.  I could have figured it out and rescued it had I gotten a more descriptive error message than (848ecb5f-912f-43d2-a2dc-b06bad3b837b).  After reading my account of what happened one of my friends said his wife threw their code away also.  Really, who's idea was it to put the number OUTSIDE the packaging?

I emailed Sony the full story I have detailed above, and they were kind enough to give me a new number.  Using my virtual Windows XP machine I was able to register the movie.  I hit download but it insisted I install Silverlight.  I really don't like installing even more security hazards onto an already security hole riddled OS, especially when it's Sony asking me to do it who never did admit wrong doing in the whole root-kit fiasco, even though they're paying the fine for it.

So, I have the Ultra Violet copy working on my emulated Windows machine.  I decide to get fancy with it, I go back to a browser running on my native Linux OS, I log into the Ultra Violet site, I see my movies from other studios, click on them, they work.  I click on the Smurfs, it sends me to the Sony website and it gives me another long horrendous string of numbers.

I tried playing with browser user agent strings.  Instead of working or giving me numbers it gives me a blank screen when I pretend to be IE, when I use Firefox but tell it I'm using the Windows version it lets me attempt to log in, but it still errors out.

When they say you had better pay your taxes unto Lord Microsoft to watch a Sony movie they mean it.

Universal has a far superior implementation of Ultra Violet, as it stands the Sony version only works if you're an MS sheeple, or possibly if you own a PS3.",1325289600,5,3916,4.778273809523809

It started pretty good but when they went into the city, it was terrible. in short I would not rent or buy this. Maybe rent off Netflix, that way it's free and no money is spent on a garbage movie.

I am not a picky movie goer. I can sit through almost anything that is not gory. But this movie was so boring and and the ""comedy"" so contrived that I felt embarrassed for the writers. What's the word?... CORNY! That's it! This is the CORNIEST movie I've ever forced myself to sit through. The villain was particularly annoying in that regard. The animation was kind of neat, though not nearly as good as I had anticipated, and my five year old seemed to like it okay though and laughed at a few of the jokes, so that is why I gave it two stars.",1324080000,,737,4.089655172413793

Certainly not as varied or refined as what was found at, for example, the ""Rango"" level. A bit of unique personality came through for each Smurf character although some Disney dwarfs style stereotyping was present. Quite good acting from our human characters especially Azaria as Gargamel. Storyline was just unique enough to hold your attention although the idea of mythical creatures coming through some sort of space/time warp into our world, humorously trying to acclimate themselves and then trying to find their way back, has been done often enough.

3715662,1,B001JQ31LO,"Throwbacks to bygone eras are nothing new in Hollywood, and for the past few years, it seems the 1980s have been the decade of choice to reference and mimic, with '80s themes appearing in both live action and animated fare. Enter The Smurfs, based on those lovable little blue creatures who kept children entertained for years on Saturday mornings. In this film adaptation, a handful of Smurfs are chased through a portal by the evil wizard Gargamel, only to end up in the real world of Manhattan. There, they befriend a sympathetic couple who help them find a way back home. I found almost nothing to like about the movie, which makes sense on some level: The Smurfs was clearly crafted to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and by ""lowest"" I mean ""shortest""... you know, kids. With broad, slapsticky humor and ""Smurf""-heavy dialogue, this movie probably won't do anything for you if you're over the age of 5, but if you want your little ones to learn in the simplest way what ""Greedy"" and ""Vain"" mean, you could possibly do worse.",1323475200,4,1038,4.708791208791209

We are introduced to the Smurfs as they perform a song number in their village, see Gargamel crash the party and destroy their village... and then inexplicably it takes a left turn as Smurfs escape through a worm hole to modern Manhattan with Gargamel in pursuit. The remainder of the movie becomes a tedious alternating snore of chase scenes and ""bonding"" scenes as the Neil Patrick Harris character tries to deal with his uninteresting middle class issues. Which design should he use for an ad campaign? Who cares! Is he 100% comfortable with the baby his wife is due to have? Who cares! This story is so mechanical, so tedious that you could almost have replace the Smurfs for the Hop bunny or Alvin and the Chipmunks or Yogi Bear and it would have made as much sense. It's bland, lazy, a criminal waste of a good franchise and just a waste of time. Perhaps really young kids won't care and the CG is pretty good but it could have been so much better.

PROS -
1) Keeps your interest throughout the whole film.
2) Good Clean Fun, no deragatory speech or offensive language, no smarty pants characters who make others feel down (like the Chipmunks Part 2).
3) Lot's of funny moments which will make you laugh.

CONS -
None really, except if you want to see a traditional animated film, this is not it.  This movie has real humans with computer generated Smurf characters.

3715670,3,B001JQ31LO,"First, let me say that I enjoyed the movie. I have been a fan since the Hanna-Barbera cartoon from the eighties.  This is a cute and enjoyable movie, even with the occasional low brow humor and over-indulgent slapstick that channels old Hollywood physical comedy.  No the story isn't overly complex, but it does dabble in backstory that pays attention to the canon from Saturday morning cartoons a la Hanna-Barbera without going into too much depth.  It's enjoyable for all ages, whether kids or kids-at-heart who want to be nostalgic or just entertained.  The cast was a good fit, even if Hank Azaria was subject to brutally obvious Wile E. Coyote moments in the story.
Now the downside: Even though I won't rant with a verbal tantrum that some of the others have already posted, I will say that I share their disappointment about my purchase of a more-expensive 3D Blu-ray version of this film, to find out that doesn't include all the extra features like ""The Smurfs - A Christmas Carol"". This one item in particular is a substantial omission from the 3D combo pack, and apparently it's not available through iTunes as of this date. It's also disappointing that the digital copy included is not an iTunes compatible format.
I do not like the new Ultraviolet streaming format for various reasons that others here have already (rather irately) mentioned, as well as one particular reason of my own. When we, the consumers, purchase something that includes a digital copy, we do expect to be able to use it with our portable devices without the over-complications of creating multiple new accounts to access it, and to receive low quality streaming that the new Ultraviolet Digital Version seems to impose.  My main issue with the service is that when I download Ultraviolet Digital Copy instead of streaming it, I haven't been able to find a selection in the software that allows me to choose where to store the file.  This is a major inconvenience when you are using a computer that only has a 256GB hard drive like the Macbook Air, and when you use a network storage device such as Time Capsule or WD Sharespace on your home network to store audio/video digital media. It also means that (so far) it will not play on an Apple TV.  I understand the right of the manufacturer to produce their own digital copy format, but that doesn't mean it is the format that consumers want, or want to pay for in lieu of important special features that are included with less expensive editions.  I definitely don't want to purchase two copies of the Blu-Ray combo packs to get everything that is typically included in all of them, including the 3D version.  My suggestion is that the industry pick a standard for digital copies just like they did when they all caved and went with Blu-Ray, and also select a standard on content inclusion/exclusion so that consumers aren't disgruntled or disappointed.",1322870400,26,2890,4.78714859437751
3715671,3,B001JQ31LO,"<Sigh> Being an animation nut and a fan of The Smurfs since the cartoon aired back in the 80s, I was really wanting to like the Smurfs film. It tells the story of a young couple expecting their first child and getting all the anxiety associated with that kind of change in life. That's when The Smurfs enter the picture. We meet Gargamel in his castle lair with his cat, Azrael, making plans to lure and capture them. He ends up following The Smurfs through a portal to New York City. The Smurfs, as I mentioned earlier, end up taking up with Grace and Patrick Winslow in their high-rise apartment. During the course of the movie, they help Patrick work through his issues about becoming a father, and reassure Grace that he's up to it. Long story short, Gargamel comes up with a master plan to get his Smurfs and that's when things get interesting.

The Smurfs isn't a bad movie, by any means. It's a decent movie with alot of good humor in it, mostly provided by Hank Azaria(Gargamel). I guess I was expecting it to be a little more along the lines of movies like Casper or Scooby Doo(since the latter was made by this movie's director). Yet, the movie was a little thin as far as the screenplay was concerned. At any rate, the cast did a tremendous job with their roles. It must've did well enough at the box-office as there is a second movie planned for theaters in 2013.

Although, I do recommend it to everyone. It is a good family film. I just can't bring myself to give it more than three stars. For some reason, I feel the movie doesn't live up to the spirit and overall quality of the cartoon series. I hate to be that way but I like to be honest.

All I can say is rent this one first and then decide if it is worth a purchase.",1322870400,,1738,4.276595744680851
3715672,1,B001JQ31LO,"1st, this is a PRODUCT review, ONLY.

Why is there not a 3D edition, which includes the ""Christmas Carol"" mini-movie!?? (or the other special features included in the non-3D Blu-Ray edition??)
Why are there TWO blu-ray discs (the movie & more special features) on the STANDARD Blu-Ray release... but NOT for the 3D release???

More importantly, WHY, are these Dummies making us pay for STANDARD DVDS!?
HELLO, WE UPGRADED TO BLU-RAY FOR A REASON!
Why, habitually, stick the Consumer, with something they DO NOT WANT... give us NO  NON-DVD-included & therefore slightly Cheaper alternative; and then slap us in the face a second time by forcing us to choose either the 2D Blu-Ray w/ more features & ""mini-movie"", or the superior-watching-experience of the 3D Version with LESS features & NO ""Christmas Carol movie"", which HELLO, is why people are upgrading to 3D-TVs!

I'm so sick of this entire Industry. I've refused to buy past releases which had Theatrical 3D screenings; but which were not given 3D Blu-Ray releases... because I knew (and have been proven right, again & again), that if I just waited 2-6 Months, they'd FINALLY release the movie in Blu-Ray 3D... thus showing, with my purchase (and initial, failure to purchase) what these idiots should be doing, and that I, and many others, were tired of this ""Edition"" game.

Now, these LOSERS, have formulated yet another way, to SCREW THE CONSUMER. Fantastic, way to go, ladies & gentlemen.. you must be exceptionally proud of yourselves. Would you like me to just mail you my wallet & let you decide what I should purchase?... because clearly you've ignored the masses who wait to buy the 3D releases when they're initially withheld... and you've clearly ignored the Millions (if not Billions) of ticked-off customer-reviews, critic-blogs, and so forth, over the last 2 or 3 years (longer, if you take out the 3D element).... clearly, you know better than we do, what we want and when we want it.

So, I guess I'll do the only thing I'm left with doing at this point... buy the superior movie-watching-experience edition (ie, 3D)... and hope I can borrow, rent, or download it.  Congratulations... instead of making a satisfied customer, you've made a ticked-off customer, who has to download your content (from one of the countless 'share' sites)... when I'd GLADLY, GLADLY mind you, have had THAT 2nd Blu-Ray disc w/ the mini-movie & extra features, in my 3D Edition, instead of an unwanted, lesser-quality, DVD disc, which always either gets tossed, or given away... and PERHAPS, would've even Gladly paid $1 extra, to have that substitution available as an option!

And you Industry-Dopes wonder why so many people PIRATE YOUR MOVIES / CONTENT / ETC!... Hello!... they're tired of NOT getting their money's worth... they're TIRED of the ""ultimate""/""deluxe""/""collector""/etc. Edition-Game.... and they're TIRED of YOU, telling them what they want, instead of EARNING our business, like any GOOD / NORMAL, business would do.

(PS: every time someone gives away, or sells, those Unwanted DVDs in your IDIOTIC ""combo-packs"", that's 1 Regular-DVD-Release SALE which you LOSE... Duh!... and again, I ask, how is it, you still wonder, and ponder over the dilemma, of how to increase sales & decrease piracy!? How many times, exactly, must we, the Consumer, tell you what we want, before we finally give up, and stop buying all-together?  I'm not even a ""Smurf"" fan. I thought the movie was decent... could've done without the blatant & irritating product-placement & glamorization of certain things, behaviors, etc... could've been a lot better... and yes, I'm still just as ticked-off, despite the fact that I would give this movie only 3.5 stars (at best)... it's the PRINCIPLE, not the movie, so don't waste your breath saying ""oh, that person's just a smurf-fanatic"" or something just as ridiculous -- that would be your Denial & Self-Deception speaking; and it won't give you an ""out"" this time, sorry.)

So, the average is 3 stars.  Ultraviolet is fitting name for this new format, because just like how you can't see UV ray, the way this is structured my kid will never be able to see this movie on an iPad.

I put the movie in for him and thought I would get the digital copy downloaded while he was watching it.  Smurfs is almost over, and I'm just now figuring this stupid system out.  I had to create *2* accounts (though I actually created 3: Sony, UV, and Flixter which I apparently didn't need?  Or maybe I will, who knows, their site isn't working properly right now anyway).  I should not have to create so many accounts just to watch a movie I paid for.....

Streaming quality is horrible: Netflix is far superior (and I'm less than 10 feet from my router).  The interface is not user friendly -- on the iPad I click ""Videos"" then the movie I want to watch and its there.  It's so simple a toddler can do it.  Here, I have to log in to my Sony Pictures account (something my son won't be able to figure out for many more years) just to watch a pixelated version that looks like it was shot with an old camera phone.

If he wants to watch Smurfs on the iPad while on the go -- forget it. There is a digital copy downloading to my computer, but as best as I can determine its not syncable to my iDevice -- *SO WHATS THE POINT?!?!*  I'm not talking about streaming here -- I'm talking about long car rides where I put 3-4 movies on the device, hand it to him in the back seat and let him watch until we get to our destination.  If I can't add this file format to iTunes, its pointless to own.  I don't care about streaming content from the cloud -- not everyone has an unlimited data plan and not everyone has a 3G enable tablet.

I'm very irritated right now.  I'll end up paying double for this movie because I'll download the iTunes version for him at some point.  And if this was an easy, universal system as its painted to be I'd be okay with it -- not everything I use has the Apple logo on it.  The way this is set up makes me want to pirate the movie to a digital format that I can use.  Which is exactly what the studios are claiming to prevent -- so if thats the case, stop making it so hard for honest people to use the media we pay for in a fair way!

Well, Sony Pictures Animation finally brings the Smurfs to life, and I have to say that they look great! They neither look too real or like a bunch of animated PVCs, but they are still fairly recognizable and the texturing is just so awesome (Papa Smurf's beard and Smurfette's hair are particular standouts) it makes me jealous of the character model developers. And unlike other attempts to create CGI-animated cartoon characters in live-action settings (Garfield, Alvin And The Chipmunks, Scooby Doo), they work very well blending it with their surroundings.

I like all the characters in the film, both the Smurfs and the humans, though I would personally prefer Hefty being one of the main characters instead of Gutsy, who is basically an ethnic duplicate of the character thrown in just to have that type of a Smurf character. Hank Azaria was perfect as Gargamel, though he voices him much different from the deliciously hammy (and now eternally unavailable) Paul Winchell. For Smurf voice actors, Jonathan Winters was perfect as Papa Smurf (though only second to the late Don Messick who was basically THE voice of Papa Smurf), and Katy Perry was perfect as Smurfette. There was hardly a voice actor for the Smurfs that I didn't like, but with the film focusing mostly on six primary Smurf characters, there was hardly any place in it for the other Smurfs to appear except in the early and later parts.

As for the story, it does time-travel from their ancient medieval forest world to modern-day New York City and how the characters deal with being thrown into a future world while trying to find a way to get back home -- or in Gargamel's case, how to capture the Smurfs and use them to become the most powerful wizard. I like how the creators use a bit of recursive canon as far as the Smurfs' real-world creator, Peyo, using his cartoon skills to show the world his discovery of their legend, which becomes an important part of the film as the Smurfs must find one of his books in order to find the spell that opens the portal back to their own world and time. Overall the story is very funny and entertaining, but I really don't want to see this story idea get used too often in the sequels that Sony Pictures Animation plans to do.

While I will rate this one star lower for not using enough Smurf characters in the story, I would have to say that this film is definitely a must-get for Smurf fans of any age.

UPDATE: The Christmas Carol special got leaked early, but it's definitely worth seeing when you get this package. The quality of the 2D animation is better than that of the original Hanna-Barbera cartoon show, even though it shares a similar style.",1320969600,,2976,4.673664122137405
3715677,3,B001JQ31LO,"I'm not going to lie to you- this movie was a bit of a pain to watch. It's not a surprise that I'm not a big Smurf fan. That said, the group of kids I watched it with loved it.

3715679,5,B001JQ31LO,"This movie resembles two recent 3D videos: it uses the same combination of real-life footage with cartoons as ""Yogi bear"" and its cartoon heroes resemble gnomes from ""Gnomeo and Juliet"". Like with ""Yogi Bear"", there is an entertaining plot which keeps you occupied, and there is good humor which makes you laugh. Smurfs is a little better than Yogi Bear, though, because plot is more sophisticated and acting is more complex and involved. There is nothing in this movie to scare little kids but they may get bored as one probably has to be 10+ years old to understand all the humor and adult's problems with balancing professional life with family and Smurfs, but adults will certainly have fun. I honestly think it is one of the better movies that came out in 3D to-date.

Talking about 3D - 3D effects are OK but not outstanding. There are several scenes made with extensive use of computer graphics done with 3D in mind which stand out, but the rest of the footage is regular 3D footage of live action with fine, but not stunning depth.

I noticed that this movie got several bad reviews on Amazon, with one and two stars ratings. As I looked through those reviews, I noticed that they were all written by people who remember Smurfs from TV shows from decades ago and who are frustrated that Smurfs in this movie are so different from what they remember. I can't blame them - this is human nature and the way how we attach to memories from the past. I never saw the original story, and if I saw it today, I probably would find it boring and outdated as the majority of old films and shows. Without the set of mind pre-determined by expectations about smurfs, I enjoyed the movie and found that it was fun to watch!",1320710400,32,1717,4.517684887459807

The movie that you are looking at is one of the first to use the new ""Ultra Violet"" system for digital copy and distribution. A lot of you may not have heard anything about it and  asking what is Ultra Violet.  The hype around Ultra Violet says that it will allow you to stream your digital copy to any device and the files are store in the cloud so that once you purchase a single digital copy you won't ever need to replace it when technology changes.  The reality is that the system is being forced on consumers before it is ready as of the release of Green Lantern and Horrible bosses (first 2 movies to use the system in mid October) exactly 0 mobile devices or set top boxes support the system and few will in the near future. Another major issue with the new digital distribution is the streaming aspect if you have a smart phone or tablet device on a limited data package is you stream a single 2 hour movie in HD the amount of data transferred could easily put you over the common 2 GB data packages.",1318723200,26,1099,4.219047619047619

The only difference is that Master of the Universe was made at the height of the shows popularity. This film was not. The acting is not that good. The subplot is ponitless. It doesn't know which age group they trying to appeal too. Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria were wasted in this film. It's not funny at all. The Smurfs song is annoying. The only good thing about this film is the CGI. AND YOU THOUGHT THE LAST AIRBENDER WAS A BAD FILM!!!! I give this film 1 out of 10.,1316304000,7,581,4.290909090909091

3715688,3,B001JQ31LO,"The big screen version of ""The Smurfs,"" creation of Pierre Culliford, otherwise known as Peyo, centers on the adventures of the six Smurfs, who are sucked into a vortex while being chased by the evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria). The Smurfs - Brainy, Clumsy, Grouchy, Gutsy, Papa Smurf and Smurfette - find themselves in modern-day New York City, where they start to live with a married couple Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and Grace (Jayma Mays).

But maybe summering the thin plot is pointless. All you have to know is 1) the film is helmed by Raja Gosnell, director of two ""Scooby-Doo"" films and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua""; 2) Hank Azaria as a real-life actor plays a bumbling sorcerer Gargamel, overacting with a heavy make-up. He is very funny - or very annoying, depending on the viewer's mood; 3) Gargamel's cat Azrael steals every scene even from Smurfs.

Having seen two ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies and two ""Garfield"" movies, we are no longer impressed with the combination of CG/live-action characters. Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation did a decent job, but some use of CGI (especially on the cat) is a bit conspicuous.

""The Smurfs"" is a mindless family film that is farcical and silly. Jokes are obvious, sometimes low-brow and even self-aware, just like the ""Scooby-Doo"" film I saw ten years ago. Not exactly a bad thing, though the film needs something more.",1316131200,2,1390,4.957081545064377

I asked my daughter if she would have liked it better if it was a cartoon and she said no.  She is 6 years old and she loved it.

3715693,4,B001JQ31LO,"I just finished watching Smurfs with my kids in the movie theater and definitely recommend it to children agest 7-12.  To properly rate this movie, I'll comment on it from the standpoint of ""should you take your kids to see it?""  The movie itself is good with an easy storyline to follow.  Gargamel wants to capture the ""essence"" of the Smurfs so he can be the besdt magician in the world. To do that, he needs to capture one of the Smurfs and the movie goes about telling the story of how he tries to do that.  I thought that a child under the age of 7 will likely not get all the innuendos and may even be scared at certain points in the movie--especiall of Gargamel.  12 year old on the other hand are about at the ceiling where they would find the movie funny and entertaining. There are definitely some good jokes that even adults would like--but not enough to recommend it solely for adults who want to see it themselves (although curiously there are always adults in this sort of movie--I kind of wonder why?)

3715694,5,B001JQ31LO,"Movies like ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", ""Yogi Bear"", ""Hop"" and this one here definitely devide viewers into two different factions. Either you love them or loath them and it won't be different with this one. A majority of critics seem to hate this kind of movie for it is brainless, dumbed-down entertainment for kids and geeks, nothing more, nothing less.
Don't expect a cerebral piece of art in the vain of the better Pixar movies. If you're okay with slapstick jokes, colorfully smurfed language and blue cuteness for cuteness' sake than this movie is for you. If you couldn't stand ""Alvin"" and its squeakquel, if you hated ""Hop"" and ""Yogi Bear"" and if you expect a ""faithful"" adaptation of an old cartoon, avoid this one like plague.
This is from the director who gave us both ""Scooby Doo"" life-action flicks, so no, this one's not Pixar or even ""Shrek"", it is NOT all-age animation art, it simply is a straight-forward kiddie flick that adults may be able to enjoy if they cultivate their inner child and aren't afraid of switching off their brains in favor of mindless escapist fun.",1312502400,2,1087,4.756613756613756
3715695,2,B001JQ31LO,"Raja Gosnell must be stopped.  Hanna-Barbara made amusing cartoons for children.  Movies based on Hanna-Barbara cartoons aren't half as amusing, but they're ten times more nauseating.  Gosnell doesn't get it.  First he gave us the lanky-brained ""Scooby Doo"" movies, and now this, an adaptation of the most obnoxious, hackbrained Hanna-Barbara cartoon, with the obnoxiousness and hackbrained quality of the small-screen TV series multiplied to fill the Big Screen.  It could have been worse, and children, especially younger children, do seem to enjoy most of it, which is simple slapstick and nonsense jokes.  But aren't we above this?  Aren't our children above this?  Pixar makes perfect films for children, films encouraging thoughtfulness, films about emotion and humanity.  This is one of the many modern children's movies that are just adult films dumbed down to a childish level, with all the life cut out.

3715696,5,B001JQ31LO,"Young kids (10 and younger) will love it. The younger the kids are, the more they'll love it. Older kids (10-14?) will probably still love/like it, but I suspect the older, the less they'll like it.

Adults with `kid hearts' will also love it. Other adults (with kids) will like it. And a few may not like it. But if you have young kids, watch it with them. They'll thank you for it. If you don't have young kids, you probably won't go watch this movie,... but it's has some real funny parts.

Then again, if you are an adult Smurf fan,... who knows!? Smurfs have been around for a long long time. Even before the animated TV-series. They are a comic strip creation by Belgian cartoonist Peyo, in the late 50'ies, apparently very popular in Europe, way before they were introduced to the US in the animated cartoon series. If you are older, and familiar with the Smurfs comic strips by Peyo, (perhaps when you were living in Europe as a kid ... ;-) ... ) you may simply appreciate and love/like how it was brought to life in this movie.

Personally, I liked the movie. Not so much the mushy-mellow-moral scenes (thankfully just a few moments), but there are many funny Smurf scenes and lines. I had good laughs. And I think I never heard the kids laugh so much, and so hard! Not even with Cars2.
