8434295,5,B004LGGXGY,Excellent all the way around. I would buy from them again. Very satisfied overall.,1414713600,,82,4.928571428571429
8434296,5,B004LGGXGY,"The cool side of science and great visuals about what happens in the universe.  This series was cut short way too soon.  It is a good thing that the 3 episodes that were filmed are available on DVD.  If you or your kids like space or are interested in science, this is a fun show that won't disappoint.",1403136000,,302,4.172413793103448
8434297,4,B004LGGXGY,"It is a little bit awkward, but that is probably because it only had the three episodes and couldn't really establish a tone.  However, for the price, it was worth it.",1393027200,,167,4.387096774193548
8434298,5,B004LGGXGY,I wish blu-ray version was available too! I also wish there were more episodes. I am a Phil Plait fan! He should make more TV programs like this.,1382659200,,145,4.214285714285714
8434299,5,B004LGGXGY,"Phil Plait's Bad Universe is an adaptation from the first three chapters of his book, 'Death from the Skies'. The book, and TV show, contain a calm but passioned analysis of how the dangers contained in the universe. Rather than just listing the ways in which the earth can be seriously damaged or even destroyed, Dr. Plait rationally assesses not just the types of dangers but also the likelihood of each danger reaching us. These first three episodes deal with threats from asteroids, alien invasion, and gamma ray bursts. The episodes are well done and interesting. But apparently, Discover Channel thinks they're not interesting enough, and they have seemingly dropped the rest of the book as a bad read. Would love to see the rest of the book on TV. But if you can't wait for the producers to find the cash, check out the book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-from-the-Skies-These-Are-the-Ways-the-World-Will-End/dp/0670019976/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death from the Skies!: These Are the Ways the World Will End . . .</a>",1350777600,,1078,5.619631901840491
8434300,5,B004LGGXGY,"What you can't see CAN kill you, if its facing the right way in the case of Gamma Ray Bursts.  Not to fear, Dr Phil Plait; the Bad Astronomer, details the facts about all the frightening yet awesome astronomical events that are in our cosmic back yard from Gamma Ray Bursts to Earth Crossing Asteroids, Dr Plait describes in detail all the things which could happen as our being part of the cosmos.
  I agree that this series, as short as it may be, allows a person the sense of peril and thrill at being alive in a living breathing universe with demonstrable examples, ala Mythbusters.

8434301,5,B004LGGXGY,"This show is fantastic.  Phil Plait is an amazing scientist.  This show is really Mythbusters on a planetary scale.

My problem is there are only THREE episodes!  Why?!  And then it is $14 at the current preorder price.  I would pay it, if promised a second season...
The Discovery Channel has fallen far, unfortunately, and good science shows do not count as much as profits...  I fear there will be no more of this scientific, intelligent, educational show.",1303430400,6,459,4.8076923076923075
