8747987,5,B01APFXYWU,"This double CD and DVD are excellent.
The tracks are very well recorded and faithful to their original album.
The musianship is first class,vocals and harmonies have to be heard to be believed.
John Young and his colleagues need to be congratulated. The music is 5 star prog!
Lifesigns have some similarities to other prog bands but are very distinctive in their use of melody; beat and atmosphere.
Lyrics are intelligent and heart felt. For me they are on par with the best prog bands. They deserve more air play.",1485216000,4,514,4.722222222222222
8747988,5,B01APFXYWU,"This will play in U.S and Canadian DVD players as it is NTSC and region free. A fantastic performance by a top flight prog band. If you're a fan of this type of music but haven't heard/ seen the band, take a chance, you will love it.",1481500800,,233,3.978723404255319
8747989,5,B01APFXYWU,"IMPORTANT!! This is not a Playback Region 2 DVD!! This will play PERFECTLY on your US DVD player, ignore the mistaken Amazon warning!

This is a brilliant live recording from a fantastic and criminally underrated band. The quality of this live recording is amazing. John Youngs lead vocals are fantastic, as is his skilled and tasteful keyboard work. Drummer Frosty Beedle is on fire. He delivers a sublime foundation on which the other members can excel. Jon Pool bass lines are heavy and sweet and melodic where the music asked for it. And what a showman he is!! Niko Tsonev is a true guitar master. This is a band where the members are so connected that warmth comes from the stage and the crowd feels it and reacts to that. Surely a DVD your collection is in need of!",1481500800,3,771,4.546762589928058
8747990,5,B01APFXYWU,"A quality item by a quality band,and yes it will play in USA and Canada and everywhere else.",1481500800,2,92,4.166666666666667
8747991,5,B01APFXYWU,"The DVD is fully NTSC and will work in the USA, Canada and all over the world. For some reason Amazon have ignored every email
we sent to tell them this and they still insist on putting up a warning! We have not had one DVD returned from any U.S. Sale.
Hope you enjoy it :-)",1475971200,3,274,3.9107142857142856
