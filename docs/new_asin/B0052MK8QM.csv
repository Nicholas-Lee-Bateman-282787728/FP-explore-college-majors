4530126,4,B0052MK8QM,"It seems odd that a show about Captain America wouldn't actually get a DVD release in America, but for those of you with a way to play imported DVDs (my method of choice is a free computer program called ""VLC"", which will play discs regardless of your drive's set region), this set is a must have.

The restoration is done very well for a cartoon of this age. You can definitely tell it's a very old show, but the picture is fairly clean and well defined, and it scales well on my 1080p monitor (the extra 96 lines of pixels that European DVD's have over NTSC DVD's probably doesn't hurt either). The color is washed out in some places, but that's more an issue with the source material than it is with the restoration job done for this release. The sound is also fine as well, and you can always make out what's being said and what's going on. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't have any bonus features, but it's a pretty inexpensive set, so I don't mind. All-in-all, I think Clear Vision Entertainment made this look and sound as good as it possibly could have.

As for the show itself, it's cheesy, but highly entertaining. It perfectly conveys the craziness of Silver Age comic books, and is a lot of fun to watch despite the hilariously cheap production value. The animation is very limited, but the show makes up for it with pure energy and since the drawings are taken straight from Jack Kirby's comic illustrations, the art does look very good most of the time. Sometimes there are hilarious animation goofs, like Cap's mouth moving while someone else's voice coming out, or his face being visible through his mask in a far shot. Every minute, something is either getting punched, blown up, or shot, and when that's not happening, someone is usually giving a melodramatic speech (Cap sure does love freedom!). Captain America himself is voiced mostly well, but the other Avengers have hilariously inappropriate voices. Ant-Man sounds super sleepy, Wasp whispers every line, and Iron Man is just unreasonably calm about everything (Iron Man also has to say the line ""Paste Pot Pete is the world's Foremost authority on adhesives"", so I'll cut him some slack). There's a lot about this show that qualifies as ""so-bad-it's-good"", but at the same time, the earnestness and enthusiasm of it all is highly endearing and charming and there is a lot that's genuinely good (such as the non-stop action). Comic fans will appreciate that the stories are ripped straight from the comics, so there's a lot to love. Honestly, I found this show more entertaining and action-packed than the far more famous Spider-Man cartoon of the same time period.

One massive issue with this set that actually keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is that one of the episodes is out of order. On some shows, this wouldn't matter much, but this show does try to follow the timeline of the comics, making this a huge oversight. Basically, the eighth episode, The Revenge of Captain America, is placed fourth on this disc. This is a huge problem, because the first three episodes are World War Two adventures, but this episode happens after Cap is awakened in the modern day, meaning we suddenly get a time skip without seeing how he is revived (which is covered by the actual fourth episode, The Return of Captain America). Furthermore, a character dies at the end of this episode, only to show up alive and well two episodes later due to the error in order. If you want to watch the show properly, you have to use the ""episode selection"" menu, so buyer beware. This is a really bad mistake, especially considering the care that this DVD set was otherwise constructed with.

Other than that one issue, this is an almost perfect set of a very fun, watchable cartoon, and very much worth getting if you have the means to watch imported DVD's. I look forward to getting the other Marvel sets that this company has put out.",1442361600,6,3896,4.674927113702624

4530134,4,B0052MK8QM,"Good classic series. Not as good as Thor. Plan on getting all the 66 Marvel toons. Don't buy unless you have a no region disk player (in the U.S.). Its ironic that this classic Captain America cartoon hasn't been released in America, therefore you can only watch it on a U.K. disk. Disney acquired all these rights to Marvel, but are crap at making things available to the public. Disney likes to keep things in their ""vault"". They can put this in their vault!

8454002,3,B0052MK8QM,"The old Captain America series are great. The only reason  this gets 3 stars is because Its ironic to buy a Captain America cartoon from UK, region  2, the United States is region 1. My laptop is limited to how many times I can switch from region 1 to region 2 and back. I erased buying other older marvel cartoons like ""Spiderman"" later revised ""Spiderman and His Amazing Friends"" which came out in the 1980's, ""Thor"", ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"". Had this tape begin available on region 1, it would have garnered a four star rating. I feel like I was ""Duped"" a.k.a. ""Conned"" into buying this tape since I can't see it again. If I want to I would have to spend more money to get a DVD that works with region 2.",1486080000,2,720,4.286764705882353

Yes, it is in PAL format, but I was fortunate enough to have a DVD player (Oppo Digital DV-981HD) that allowed me to change it to a region free player.  I'm REALLY happy!",1483574400,,280,4.054545454545455
8454006,5,B0052MK8QM,"For it's time, the cheesy animation was ""normal"" so should not be compared to modern animation. Most of it was done on a limited budget, yet still is able be entertaining..
It is quite odd that this classic Captain AMERICA collection is not made for AMERICAN regions. You can buy a multi-region DVD player which is a good idea if you are planning to watch many Region 2/PAL DVDs, but for those in North America who think they cannot watch this Region 2/PAL  disc set, because you don't have a Multi-region or PAL player or don't want to buy one, if your PC has a DVD drive, simply download the free VLC Player or 5K Player which plays all regions. Whether you are a Captain America fan or want to relive the TV series you watched as a kid, this set is nice to have.",1470614400,2,765,4.275862068965517
