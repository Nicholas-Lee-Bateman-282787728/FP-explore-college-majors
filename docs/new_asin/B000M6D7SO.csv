2725759,5,B000M6D7SO,"There's several versions of this movie, all of which are so difference. My husband wanted this version. He loves it.",1295049600,,116,4.85
2725760,3,B000M6D7SO,"Any resemblance to anything written by Jack London in William Wellman's 1935 version of The Call of the Wild is purely coincidental: it's set in the Yukon, and there's a dog called Buck in it who has to pull a thousand pound weight in one scene for a bet, but that's about it. But this Buck is a huge St Bernard and he's only a bit player in a gold rush romp tailored for Clark Gable - but then at the height of his popularity, audiences would probably have burned the theatres to the ground if he'd played second fiddle to a hound. More famous for Gable and co-star Loretta Young emerging from the snowed-in on-location shoot with an illegitimate child, it's an enjoyable enough yarn even in the abridged reissue cut that or decades seemed to be the only version surviving, although it shamefully throws away Reginald Owen's excellent villain, who deserves a much better exit than he gets here.

Sadly Fox's original DVD is only the cut (by some 11 minutes) wartime reissue version rather than the original. A decent extras package includes an audio commentary by Darwin Porter; stills gallery, restoration comparison, reissue trailer, and trailers for The Tall Men and Soldier of Fortune. But thankfully Fox's 2013 region-free Blu-ray release finally offers the film in its original 92-minute glory (the most notable restorations are Katherine de Mille's brief role as Gable's girlfriend and Buck fighting the lead dog to take its position, though other sections in the first half have been noticeably expanded) and in a very pleasing transfer. The commentary and reissue trailer have been retained as extras but the extensive stills gallery, restoration comparison and other Gable trailers have been dropped.",1241654400,41,1711,4.961672473867596
2725761,5,B000M6D7SO,.....Gable is in his element as the macho rugged outdoorsman and adventurer ...Loretta Young is captivating as the conflicted woman loved by two men ...the chemisty between Gable and Young came through the screen and was probably fueled by their real life affair while shooting  the movie ...the ending had a Casablanca flair with the two lovers going separate ways because of commitment to principles and honor ...this is a five star gem and movie worth watching over and over.,1239494400,13,478,4.975
2725762,5,B000M6D7SO,I had been looking for this and finally found it at Amazon it was a great movie with Clark Gable and Loretta Young they conceived a child they were snowed in for several weeks she went away until after the baby was born and pass it off as adopted he seen her once.

2725763,5,B000M6D7SO,The DVD edition - to me - is very good. Course it is B&W - but one admires the quality of the photography. I wanted it more for my grandchildren than anything else.

2725773,2,B000M6D7SO,"Loretta Young and Gable are pitch-perfect in this very Hollywood-ized version of Jack London's story; but I find Jack Oakie's constant presence as Gable's side-kick almost impossible to watch. Unlike the ultimately endearing chemistry that ""side-kick"" Walter Brennan had with John Wayne in films like RIO BRAVO, Oakie (as Gable's pal) is a legitimate co-star, appearing in virtually every scene, grotesquely over-acting and constantly doing the kind of double-takes that belong in a Three Stooges movie. I'm sure (as a live entertainer) Mr. Oakie was a fine Vaudeville / Music Hall performer, but his over-the-top antics and strained effort to turn every line into a boffo rim-shot is excruciating to behold. William Wellman may have had a unique talent for directing action films, but his sense of humor seems to have been formed in the Second Grade. Since this film isn't really Jack London's novel, it isn't really worth the effort. Bottom line: Unless you're a rabid Gable or Loretta Young fan, I'd let this one pass.",1457481600,,1021,5.119760479041916

2725782,5,B000M6D7SO,Just to watch the interaction of Mr. Gable with Buck while they play together is well worth the price.  It's easy to see that Clark Gable loved dogs as nobody can act that well with a Saint Bernard slobbering on you! Excellent piece of work by all involved.,1446854400,,257,4.354166666666667

2725789,4,B000M6D7SO,"I have wanted to see this film for years, and finally I have. It certainly lived up to the hype.

Two claim jumpers are off to steal a gold claim from the son of the man who discovered it. What they don't expect is to run into the man's wife, alone in the wild waiting for her husband to return. They assume the worst and take her with them, and one of them falls for her. Also in their troupe is Buck, a wild Saint Bernard with a mind of his own.

First, I must commend Clark Gable on his talents as a leading man. He is both rugged and romantic, two attributes which seem to conflict on paper but make him a highly desirable actor. His chemistry with co-star Loretta Young was genuine; the two carried on a real love affair that resulted in a child. However, I am always impressed by how well he convinces his audience of his true feelings for his co-stars. He was truly the king of Hollywood, a moniker that has not been earned since.

William Wellman, another man's man, directs this film with polish and paints the wild out to be a beautiful, though savage, place.

This is a re-release print from the 40s (obvious by the plea to buy war bonds) which is a bit shorter than the original 1935 release.",1424563200,,1204,4.244541484716157

2725791,4,B000M6D7SO,"Call of the Wild was every bit as good as it was when I saw it as a child back in the late 1940s or early 1950s.  Clark Gable, Loretta Young, and Jack Oaky are wonderful together.  The Blu Ray is a beautiful restoration of the film....once again proving that movies from the 1930s can and do look wonderful by today's standards.  Crisp black and white photography.  If you are a fan of movies from this era you will appreciate Call of the Wild.  Just remember it bears little resemblance to Jack London's book....but it is still a great tale about the gold rush in the Yukon...and the wild north.",1423353600,5,596,4.381818181818182

Not like Jack London's story very much, possibly a lot  better. The important part is that for decades Call of the Wild had been available only in a truncated version. The missing scenes have been replaced and they do matter as a picture of the time and the truth of William Wellman's directorial vision. This is the film in which the romantic stars became deeply and irrevocably involved.",1389139200,,512,4.873563218390805

I really enjoyed the commentary and history behind the movie.  During the filming Ms. Young charged Gable a dollar for each curse word.  He wound up owing her thousands.  It was filmed under very difficult winter conditions and the actors suffered.  Buck was difficult to handle but bonded with Gable who adopted him, and there is more worthwhile trivia.  This is a great movie to watch on a cold winter night and for those who are interested in classic movies.",1389052800,,625,4.5675675675675675
2725810,5,B000M6D7SO,"This is not a creaky old film from 1935.  It's fresh and just as powerful on a video projector as it must have been in a movie palace.  Some Blu-ray discs of older films have been major disappointments, but this transfer--with sharp, steady picture and clear, undistorted sound--couldn't be better.  Yes, it's grainy on a big screen, but I'm glad they didn't sacrifice sharpness to treat it, as others might have done.  There are no other imperfections, and the graininess is forgotten as the story takes hold.

And take hold it does, thanks to magnificent production details, and of course, fine acting.  Clark Gable and Loretta Young were never better (apparently the love scenes were real).  Neither was Jack Oakie, who steals every scene he's in, but in a good way.  This should have been his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  In fact, it would have been, if his death scene had not ended up on the cutting room floor (where Jack picked it up and took it home).

My only disappointment was that Jack Oakie's death scene was not included as a feature on the disc.  Maybe Fox didn't know it was in the UCLA Film Archives, where it was deposited shortly after I screened it for Jack in the 1970's.  The scene was set around the bad guys' campfire.  Jack has been captured and knows he's in trouble, but launches into a long and touching monologue, after which Reginald Owen--expressionless--pulls his revolver and kills him.  Fade out.  As I said, it was Jack's Oscar scene that was not to be, and in a way I'm glad.  The rest of the film could not have recovered from the tragedy of it, as initial audiences apparently proved, and I much prefer the happy ending that was added.  I mean, you just can't do that to Jack Oakie.

Is Call of the Wild faithful to the original story?  Does it matter?  It's movie-making at its best--a magnificent adventure film, beautifully preserved.",1388793600,13,1889,4.649546827794562

2725813,5,B000M6D7SO,"While a very good (if not entirely accurate) film adaptation of Jack London's novel and starring Clark Gable in his prime no less, the big draw for the blu-ray is not only its high definition but its inclusion of several scenes cut during its '40s reissue.

Some of the cuts were done after being re-evaluated by the Production Code, such as a reference to prostitution.  Other cuts seem to have only been done to shorten the movie so it could be more easily repackaged and more often repeated as the bottom end of a double feature during the mid-1940s, capitalizing on Clark Gable's and Loretta Young's enduring popularity.  This amounted to at least 11 minutes of missing footage out of a feature slightly over 90 minutes long.

Further cuts were made once the movie was released for television by NTA, which cut out Jack Oakies' singing because they didn't want to bother with music rights.  The '40s reissue or the NTA print were the only versions available to the general public on television and hove video for decades.  Even the recent DVD used the reissue print.  But by some miracle, it finally dawned on Twentieth Century Fox that the public wanted to see to complete feature originally made by legendary director William Wellman and not some haphazardly edited reissue.

2725817,5,B000M6D7SO,"Just watched The Call of the Wild with Gable and Loretta Young.  It is now common knowledge that Gable and Young fell in love while making this movie.  If you look closely at the love scenes, you can see quite clearly that they were in love.  How could Gable resist the beauty of Young, certainly one of the greatest of Hollywood's beauties.  A classic movie with legendary stars.  Young rejected abortion (Joan Crawford aborted her child with Gable) and ingeniously adopted their daughter, raised her daughter as well as any star can, her name is Judy Lewis.  Loretta finally admitted to having Gable's child before she died of ovarian cancer in her eighties.  I'll give her credit for keeping her baby.  Gable seeminly wanted nothing to do with kids.  Only when he was older did he agree  to a child, but he died before ever seeing his son.  Too bad.  And all the while he had a lovely daughter nearby, but he ignored her.  The film is worth seeing also for Jack Oakie's performance.  He is always likeable, and Reginald Owen as always delivers a fine performance.  Young and Gable made one more movie together in the early fifties, just before Young went into TV and became a mega-TV star; the film is called The Key to the City.  And again, there is definitely chemistry between these two pros, except Young still looks glamorous, but Gable didn't age as well.",1336089600,,1364,4.620833333333334

Many years after he had passed on, Young admitted that she and Gable had an affair while making this movie. The book was more about the dog than the humans. Gable and Young were excellent actors but this was not their best work. The dog and the second banana, Oakie stole most of the scenes. Back in the 1930's all these actors worked  under contract for the big studios and ground out movies like this all the time.

Directed by William A. Wellman

The plot and story line has Clark Gable and Jack Oakie headed for gold in them thar hills.  Gable purchases a sled dog Buck who is part wolf and saves his life once or twice during the film.  Loretta Young is searching for her husband Frank Conroy who leaves her to search for another clear vein of gold.  A closeness develops between Gable and Young during the journey, when Gable realizes he must help find her husband and makes things right.

The interaction between Gable, Young and Oakie has a moral and lifting ingredient not found in todays films.

Once again Gable steals the scenes as part hero, devil may care and honorable character that he is.

* Special footnote: -- actor Clark Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in ""Dance, Fools, Dance"" (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in ""A Free Soul"" (1931) the same year. ""The Painted Desert"" (1931).  His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in ""Red Dust"" (1932) made him MGM's most important star --- ""Dancing Lady"" (1933)  Gable refused an assignment and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), which won him an Oscar,

Gable was quoted ""The only reason they come to see me is that I know life is great - and they know I know it, I'm no actor and I never have been, what people see on the screen is me."" --- it was fellow friend and actor Spencer Tracy who dubbed Gable as ""The King"".

2725824,4,B000M6D7SO,"This review refers to the DVD version of the 1935 Call of the Wild film starring Clark Gable and Loretta Young.

First, the movie: as well as I can recall the book, this film deviates from it in several areas (so should be considered to be ""based on"" it), with excellent performances by the major players. Buck (the dog) is portrayed by a St Bernard, as he was supposed to be a St Bernard cross.

Second, the DVD: The DVD was either transcribed from a pristine copy of the film, or a fair bit of restoration was done. It is VERY clean, free of vertical (film gate) scratches and other artifacts.

In all, a pleasure to watch.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clark-Gable-in-Jack-London-s-Call-Of-The-Wild-Region-One-USA-DVD/dp/B000M6D7SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clark Gable in Jack London's Call Of The Wild (Region One USA DVD)</a>",1296345600,13,877,5.628787878787879
