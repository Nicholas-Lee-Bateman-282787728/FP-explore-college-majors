8128429,5,B000G1JYHS,"I saw this program on cable TV back in the 80s and most thoroughly enjoyed seeing the main folk groups I grew up with.  At the time this show aired, Dave Guard an original founding member of the Kingston Trio was still around and did some songs with Bob Shane and Nick Reynolds.  They also had John Stewart who replaced Guard after only ten K.T. albums.  Also present were the then current members George Grove and Roger Gambill, so we had six members of the K.T. on the stage at one time.  The other guests made the whole affair a night to remember for sure.  I was thrilled to find this concert available after several years.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been to get it on DVD, but I'm not sure that was made available.  Pure folk entertainment with plenty of humor sprinkled in along the way.  Definitely worth every penny.",1352419200,,855,4.401273885350318
