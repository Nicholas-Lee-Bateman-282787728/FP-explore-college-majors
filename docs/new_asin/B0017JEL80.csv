8266192,5,B0017JEL80,"trust me, I have tried almost everything out there for violin, and Mrs. Seidel's DVD lessons are the BEST way to learn violin.  I love the Beginner Series, and the Intermediate Series is amazing!  I have learned and progressed so much from the DVD lessons, that I stopped taking private lessons, and I just study from the DVD lessons.  Thank you, Mrs. Seidel for creating a way for regular people to learn how to play violin!!",1207612800,7,426,4.578947368421052
8266193,5,B0017JEL80,"As a senior intermediate violinist who lost too much practice time
due to illness in the family, I find Mrs Seidel's Video Violin
Lessons extremely valuable in helping me get back to where I was.
She tells you again which fingers to use, where to put them, and how
to bow.  Since the violin is the most difficult instrument to learn
from a book, what could be better than these DVD lessons?  They are
great.

8266194,5,B0017JEL80,"After only 3 weeks of studying with Mrs. Seidel's  violin program I was able to study under the master violinist Deb Collins.  I didn't know how good I really was, until my new violin teacher handed me Vivaldi in A minor and I played it with confidence.  I have been invited to join the orchestra also.  So thank you Mrs. Seidel-you made my dream a reality.

I wanted to learn how to play the violin and so I choose Mrs. Seidel's DVD series.  Her program was the most thorough on teaching the violin than any other series I have purchased.  She actually teaches you how to read music and with clear and closeup video instruction. You can see the finger placements and arm positions without difficulty. What impressed me with her series, is that Mrs. Seidel didn't skip any steps, and like so many other DVD violin teaching series, assume you know how to read music; so their beginning violin is really intermediate.  Her beginning series is really starting from the beginning.

I must comment not to give up in only one day.  My first 4 days were very difficult trying to master holding the violin and making my bow run down the center space between the bridge and the finger board.  My husband even plugged his ears, but on the 5th day, beautiful sweet music begin to flow and my husband actually cried because I was making my dream come true.

A note on the sound quality, it varies from DVD players and computers.  The most important thing is that her music is in tune with your violin, which is lacking in other violin instruction programs.
