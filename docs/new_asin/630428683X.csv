831813,5,630428683X,"Based upon The Dice of God, by Hoffman Birney, this movie is a roman a clef of the events leading up to Custer's Last Stand, as seen through the eyes of Capt. Demas Harrod (Tom Tryon), whose company is one of those that escapes annihilation, and some of his men.  Harrod finds himself assigned to Sioux territory, with orders to pick up a group of new recruits on the way.  While waiting for the train, he meets and falls for Lou Woodard (Senta Berger), and they enjoy a brief, passionate liaison.  Harrod is sure he'll never see her again, but that doesn't matter very much: he has a history with the glory-seeking Colonel Frederick McCabe (Andrew Duggan), and believes that McCabe has requested his assignment to his regiment so he can put Harrod and his men in harm's way, as he did another such group which was sacrificed to the Apaches to advance McCabe's career.  Being a good soldier, Harrod doesn't fight the assignment, but he's resolved to get his recruits trained to the point where at least some of them may survive.  Meanwhile, to his astonishment, he discovers that Lou lives in the nearby civilian townand that she's being courted by Sol Rogers (Harve Presnell), Col. McCabe's civilian chief of scouts.  The Colonel is trying to persuade Rogers to come back for the forthcoming big fight, but Rogers is beginning to think he'd like to settle down with Lou and start spending the $6000 in gold dust he recently panned out.  While all this is going on, Pvt. Gentry (Erik Holland) wonders whether he'll prove to be a brave man or a coward when it comes to the test; scrappy Irish Pvt. Anthony J. Dugan (James Caan) clashes with martinet Lt. Hodges (Peter Breck); 20-year-old Pvt. Martin Hale (Michael Anderson, Jr.), who joined up to escape a shotgun marriage, discovers the real love of his life (Laurel Goodwin) and begins trying to get himself released from the Army; and Capt. Harrod not only demonstrates that he takes care of his men against all comers, but finds that, romantic rivalry aside, he and Rogers have things in common.

With his hard-boned angular face, fierce dark eyes, and erect posture, Tryon is perfectly cast as a young officer who's at once practical, compassionate, and strict, supported by long-time Western character actor Slim Pickens as veteran Sgt. Gregory.  The tension between Harrod and his colonel is never overemphasized, but runs like a taut thread under everything that happens, and the unusual slant on a well-known incident of Old West history makes this an exciting and intriguing Western that happens to be one of my all-time favorites.",1418774400,,2590,4.815315315315315

831817,3,630428683X,"""The Glory Guys"" is actually two Westerns in one. On the one hand, the film boasts an insightful script by Sam Peckinpah that explores the dilemma a junior army officer faces when he realizes his commanding officer is letting personal emotions overcome the commander's better military judgment, placing the troops in their brigade in unnecessary danger. On the other hand, the film also features the standard silly plot complications of a 60s action film: a hackneyed love triangle and knockdown barroom brawls.

The movie is a thinly disguised fictionalization of George Custer's Little Big Horn campaign, as told from the standpoint of junior officers. In the film, an army general (Andrew Duggan in the Custer role) prepares his command to take part in a major offensive with several other units against the Indians, with the stated objective of forcing them onto the reservation. In reality, Duggan is out for personal glory and wants his command alone to deal the decisive blow to the Indians. Tom Tryon plays a captain (a fictionalized version of Custer subordinates Major Reno and Captain Benteen) who served under Duggan previously and transferred out of the general's command following an earlier battle in which the general deliberately sacrificed a company of poorly trained recruits to draw the Indians out. Now, Duggan has pulled strings to get Tryon transferred back and orders him to train some more new recruits for the upcoming offensive.

I'm guessing that Peckinpah's original script for ""Glory Guys"" emphasized the battle of wills between Tryon and Duggan, as Tryon tries to be the professional soldier and train his troops, even as he realizes that Duggan does not intend to take part in a coordinated attack but, instead, rush his troops into battle on their own. It's a theme that Peckinpah would explore in greater depth in his next script, ""Major Dundee,"" a film he also directed. The scenes pitting Duggan and Tryon are by far the best dramatic scenes in the film. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of these themes find their way into the finished movie. Instead, the film, as directed by Arnold Laven (primarily a TV director), is pretty much routine studio fare.

Instead of spending most of his time squabbling with his commanding officer, Tryon spends most of his time vying with the general's chief scout (Harve Presnell) for the affection of a local widow (Senta Berger). This romantic triangle is quite tiresome and very predictable (any viewer who's ever seen a 60s Western can guess within five minutes after Presnell's character is introduced how it will turn out). ""Glory Guys"" also stints on depicting the troops' training. All viewers get to see are a couple of scenes of them taking target practice and trying to ride, all the while being browbeaten by Tryon, who continually berates them (supposedly, this type of ""tough love"" is needed to get them into shape, but the movie doesn't devote enough time to the training to make it realistic). With so little time devoted to the troops, nearly all of them are interchangeable bit players. The only two soldiers given any depth are two more Western stereotypes, the loud mouthed Irishman (James Caan) and the innocent young kid (Michael Anderson, Jr.) in love with an equally innocent town girl.

""Glory Guys"" does devote plenty of screen time to showing a couple of those incredibly fake brawls in which everyone gets a goofy look on their face when an opponent's wild haymaker punch lands, people get knocked through doors and windows a lot, and entire rooms of furniture get smashed, but no one is the worse for wear other than a couple of bruises. All in all, the brawls are about as convincing and entertaining as a backyard wrestling league battle royal.

Eventually, ""Glory Guys"" features  a major battle between the cavalry and the Indians, and the sequence is quite well staged. Back then, studio productions employed plenty of extras and sizable numbers of troops on each side in a major battle, and the money spent and attention paid to detail show here. The sequence lasts about twenty minutes and is exciting throughout, while, at the same time, easy for viewers to follow. Although anyone familiar with Custer's final campaign knows how the battle will turn out (and how the movie will end), the high level of realism in the combat sequence helps the movie maintain as much suspense as possible.

For the most part, ""Glory Guys"" is indistinguishable from dozens of other Westerns of that era, albeit with stars Tryon and Presnell having considerable less screen presence than the leads of most comparable A-level Westerns (when Peckinpah did finally make ""Major Dundee,"" he was working with Charlton Heston and Richard Harris). It's probably no coincidence that the movie marked the end of both Tryon's and Presnell's career as leading men. Fortunately, the film has a first rate set piece finale and enough well-written dramatic tension in some of the earlier scenes for me to give it a mild recommendation. However, there's just not enough glory here to warrant a better rating.",1404518400,4,5083,4.994096812278631

831891,5,630428683X,"A take off from the Battle of the Little Big Horn where Custer splits the regiment to take on the Sioux, only to meet with more than he can handle, while his other 2 companies cross the river to engage in a battle of their own, confiding in the General for support that never came.

The names of the chararcters are different, but even the personal conflicts between the General and his company commanders, ala Major Reno & Capt. Benteen, are displayed throughout the campaign against the Sioux.

James Caan provides the comedy & good natured ribbing from his army mates, but ends with serious request at the end. The gorgeous Senta Berger gives a convincing portrayal of the army widow being courted by the leading characters but disliked by the other army wives, (most likely jealousy over her great beauty).

All in all, a good balance between life in the US Cavalry, from boot camp, brawling with civilians, to training for their campaign & eventual battle against the Sioux.

831895,4,630428683X,"The Glory Guys, 1965 film

The story begins with the recruitment of men enlisting for the US Army. What kind of men are they? They will be sent into battle against the Sioux. They are trained at the fort. Their Colonel tells of a new campaign, the Third Cavalry will search for the Indians who are off their reservations. The Captain explains the use of expendables in a battle. Then he visits ""Mule City"" to see an old friend. General McCabe and his wife are in town. Later there is a fight for action. Mr. Rogers is brought to the fort. He warns about the alliance of the Indian tribes who are united against the Army. [This was caused by Chivington's raid circa 1867.] Soldiers are sent from the fort without weapons. There is an attack by Indians. But this is only a training exercise. [Plausible?]

After drinking there are fights on the street. Soldiers are arrested after they run out of money. The next day soldiers look for a missing trooper. [More action.] One soldier is punished by being tied to a cartwheel. They show a Gatling gun firing. The troops parade in review before General McCabe. At night barrels of beer are brought to the barracks. Martin says goodbye to his girlfriend. Trooper Duggan is awarded special duty. The cavalry assembles to leave in the morning. [The shadows say high noon.] The top General orders a pincer movement to trap the enemy on the sixteenth of the month. [Actually, they used three columns for this.] General McCabe plans to move out fast. ""Rise and shine!"" Two mules pull a wagon. The Rhee scouts report many hostiles. General McCabe plans to attack a day earlier (for the glory?).

McCabe orders a company to chase a small group of Indians to the North. They meet a larger group of Indians and form a skirmish line. ""Prepare to fire in volley."" The Indians charge the dismounted troopers. Where is General McCabe? He plans to attack the great concentration of Indians in their village - alone! Those troopers will fall back to the cliffs after crossing a creek. The soldiers run low on ammunition and water. Two men go to fill canteens. They survive an attack. But it is strangely quiet the next morning. They find the fallen soldiers of General McCabe. General Hoffman's column arrives on schedule. The remaining troopers mount up and move out.

This is a fictionalized version of the Battle of the Little Bighorn where General Custer and 261 soldiers were wiped out by a far larger force, the biggest Indian army ever. Chief Crazy Horse adopted the tactics of controlled attacks in place of the usual uncoordinated actions. While General Custer attacked a day ahead of schedule, the other columns arrived a day behind schedule. Was this payback for Custer's testimony before a Congressional Committee where he explained the corruption and mismanagement in the Army supply system? ""They Died With their Boots On"" is still the best movie about the charismatic George Armstrong Custer. Promoted to Brigadier General at age 23 (and helping to win at Gettysburg), he died leading his troops into battle at age 36. Custer wasn't a saint, but worthy of his valued reputation in his lifetime. Those who sneer at Custer know little about this hero and his reputation in his age. Democrats said his death was a result of the Grant Administration's corrupt policies. Republicans claimed he was rash and foolhardy. This war was provoked by the War Department.",1342656000,,3399,4.785349233390119

The cavalry charge during the opening of the climatic battle was most impressive.",1317859200,,259,5.475
832020,4,630428683X,"The story of how General George Armstrong Custer led his troops to their deaths at the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876 is a textbook example of military megalomania writ large in American history, and clearly a story ripe for a budding writer, which is what Sam Peckinpah was in the 1950s, when, at the request of the production team of Arthur Gardner, Jules Levin, and Arnold Laven, he was commissioned to write the screenplay for Hoffman Birney's novel ""The Dice Of God"", loosely based on the Custer story, and which was to become the basis for THE GLORY GUYS.  But by the time the story went behind the cameras, Peckinpah, due to the fury that he had caused in Hollywood with the extreme production conflicts on MAJOR DUNDEE, was virtually blackballed from Hollywood.  And while the end result is nowhere near a terrible product, one has to wonder just how much further this film would have gone had Peckinpah been given the opportunity to direct his own script.

Even in the finished film, there are themes Peckinpah had broached upon that are still there--the conflict between two men (Harve Presnell; Tom Tryon) and their commanding officer, a steely-eyed, almost dictatorial Cavalry commander (Andrew Duggan) out to put the Sioux in their place.  As this kind of scenario had loosely played itself out in MAJOR DUNDEE, however, Laven, who directed the film, seemed to shift the film away from this critical look at personal and military obsession to the love triangle between Tryon, Presnell, and a pioneer woman (Senta Berger, returning from MAJOR DUNDEE) at their fort.  It was a point that Peckinpah strongly (and unsurprisingly) found highly disagreeable.  In the meantime, Laven does stage plenty of good action scenes, including the attack on the Sioux, but they don't have the kind of raw (let alone bloody) energy that Peckinpah would have bought to them, and the editing of these scenes, while more than competent, isn't quite up to what was even done in the action scenes of the unfairly butchered DUNDEE.

Still, it's hard to say too many bad things about a film that is still as far removed from the old John Ford/John Wayne cavalry films as MAJOR DUNDEE had been; and Tryon and Presnell are extremely competent in their roles (though rumor has it that Lee Marvin and James Coburn were both considered first, before salary conflicts forced Laven to settle for the other two).  There are also early roles for James Caan as an Irish-born cavalryman; and Wayne Rogers, later to star in the long-running TV series M*A*S*H, as another cavalry officer.  Slim Pickens, who is never anything less than memorable, also does a good turn as one of the members of the cavalry.  Perhaps the best thing about THE GLORY GUYS, besides those moments when the film lays Duggan's military megalomania bare, is the superb cinematography, most of it done on location near Durango, Mexico, of James Wong Howe, who had won an Oscar in 1963 for HUD.

All in all, THE GLORY GUYS does hold up as an extremely competent film.  But it still leaves one to wonder just how much further up the ladder of quality sagebrush film making it would have gone had Peckinpah been the one in the director's chair.  One can, unfortunately, only speculate.",1297382400,2,3235,4.807207207207207
832021,5,630428683X,"This is my favorite movie regarding the campaign of the U.S. Army vs. the Sioux nation which took place in May and June 1876, of which the Custer and the 7th Cavalry was the center of attention for the nation during its centennial celebration.  Many movies have come out of Hollywood and none have ever depicted the battle at the Little Bighorn very accurately.  This movie comes close to portraying one aspect of the battle reasonable accurately and that is the charge of Reno's battalion and its retreat to the bluffs where it held out along with Benteen's battalion.  Unfortunately, nothing is shown of Custer's charge and annihilation but this would have made a long movie for which Americans have little patience.  Historical accuracy is always the last factor in Hollywood and I believe that there would have been nothing wrong with using the actual commanding officers' names, i.e., Custer, Reno, Benteen, Sheridan, etc.  The title, The Glory Guys, gives the wrong impression, which is the political correctness handed out by Hollywood, as to the motives of the commanding officers.  Most are performing the duties required of them by the Army.  Every officer and enlisted man wants to be successful in battle.  It does result in promotions and glory but to do otherwise is to possibly forfeit ones' life.  Men are fighting to survive and to protect their buddies.  It is either kill or be killed.  The Indians did not take prisoners and could and did commit the most heinous atrocities to those taken alive.",1279497600,,1515,4.901960784313726

832025,4,630428683X,"...I was thrilled to see that this film was available on DVD... but nervous at seeing ""Morgan J. Freeman"" listed as the director...(instead of Arnold Laven)  Made me wonder... Only the fact that I was buying through Amazon made me go ahead and order.

...Advertised as ""letterbox..."" I got DVD and the ""jacket"" said ""FULL SCREEN""... Well, don't worry... it IS in ""LETTERBOX...""  Disc is ""bare bones...""  Absolutely no special features... not even scene selection.  You put in disc and movie runs... when done... runs again.

  ...Copy seems decent enough... especially the color... which has faded badly on the copies shown on TV... I last saw this film in widescreen at a theater in 1965 on a date... It has been shown on TV only rarely... I have had the opportunity three times in all these years (oddly, most recently the day before the DVD arrived) So a joy to see again in letterbox... with very good color... Scenes often missing in TV showings (training ride, soldier missing saloon fight) have been restored... and the sound quality is very good.

  ...As to the film itself... Would have been better if Sam Peckinpaw had directed rather than just written the screenplay (from Hoffman Birney's DICE OF GOD...)  TWO romances to bog down the plot rather than just one... Seemingly unavoidable ""bust up the saloon scene...""

  ...Having said that... a large part of the film is definitely amazing. The all time best wide screen cavalry vs Indians battle (and deployment to battle) to ever grace the screen.  It has been many years since studios could afford this scale (until computer augmentation arrived...)

  ...The Glory Guys (unfortunate title) is a thinly veiled retelling of the Custer at the Little Bighorn story.  For the most part, the terrain is hauntingly similar to Fort Abraham Lincoln area (except bluffs in distance) and the Little Bighorn itself...  Quite a feat since filming took place in Durango, Mexico... 1500 miles south of the actual location (once in a while a tall cactus type plant only found from the Sonora on south pops up...)

  ...Riz Ortolani's (theme from Mondo Cane, etc) hard driving score matches the large scale action.  More than 600 extras make the epic battle scenes memorable (wasted if not in widescreen).  The cast is excellent... including newcomers, James Caan and Wayne Rogers.  Harve Presnell (General Marshall in Saving Private Ryan) shows fine acting skills so rarely used (he was famous in musicals)

  ...Technical details not bad... such as showing the need to space out shots in four second intervals with 45.55 cavalry carbines... to avoid jamming.  And critical fact that wearing out cavalry remounts in the days leading up to battle makes any retreat costly...  Weakness of cavalry holding ground clearly shown... Horses to the rear... every 4th man horseholder... 25% of firepower immediately missing from the line.

  ...Commanding officer of regiment shown as Major General... In reality, at best would have been full colonel... (The actual commanding officer of 7th Cavalry, a full colonel,  was gone for years on detached duty) and while a Brevet Major General from the Civil War... Custer was serving as a Lt. Colonel... though addressed by most of his officers as ""General..."" a courtesy that his brevet warrented...

  ...Tom Tryon's Captain Demas is a thinly disguised Captain Benteen, one of the finest company commanders in the 19th Century U.S. Army.  Major ""Marcus"" stands in for Major Marcus Reno... an officer whose troops only survived because of Benteen having put backbone in their defense of the bluffs.

  ...Historically there is no proof that Custer wanted Benteen and Reno dead... (though Reno might well have thought so when Custer's promise of support proved worthless), a major plot item in the film, but they hated him and at best he wanted them away from as much glory as possible. Wishbone Creek mentioned in the film stands in for troops left to die at the Washita River by Custer... an action that turned half of his officers against him.

  ...There is no doubt that this is a flawed film; but where it shines... it glistens.

7867100,1,630428683X,"EGADS! What a clunker. Everybody is directed into cliches. We have over 40 Twilight Time Blu rays and the only other ""clunker"" I can report is: The Lady in Cement (Sinatra insults the audience with bigoted dialog and he simply does not care) but ""Tony Rome"" is worth it and, of course, he really shines in: ""The Detective"".  There are a LOT of great actors in ""The Cliche Guys"" but they suffer greatly by a clueless director and bad, Bad, BAHHHHD screenplay. Tons of schmaltz and, oh yes, did I mention CLICHE? I mean, this movie isn't even good enough for a TV series let alone a motion picture.

But, if you still REALLY want this movie, do yourself a favor, go directly to twilighttimemovies.com and you can purchase it for $29.95 and leave these ripoff artists in the dust where they belong.",1473292800,,795,4.5524475524475525

Well known on television as he portrayed real life western sheriff Texas John Slaughter for Walt Disney TV. A really good Native Americans vs. U.S. Cavalry movie. He is supported by a GREAT cast! Harve Presnell, beautiful Senta Berger, James Caan,  Andrew Duggan,Slim Pickens,Peter Breck, and legendary Jackie Cooper. What began as a peaceful mission to move the Sioux to reservations turns into one cavalry general's personal bloody vendetta.",1443916800,,594,4.823529411764706
