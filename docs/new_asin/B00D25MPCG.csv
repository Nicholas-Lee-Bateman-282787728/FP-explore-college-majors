8588477,5,B00D25MPCG,"I gave up on Downton Abbey after it turned into Downer Abbey, so I was thrilled to run across another BBC gem. I watched the entire first season over the course of two days and am hungry for more. The costumes alone would make me watch, and the fact that the lead actress is an intelligent, pro-active, powerful woman is a refreshing treat. I'm incredibly frustrated that I can't find a way to watch season 2 in the U.S., and heartbroken to hear it hasn't been extended for more seasons! Please reconsider future seasons and release Season 2 on Amazon Instant Video ASAP",1398211200,,570,4.543689320388349
8588478,5,B00D25MPCG,"To a young English country woman in the 1880's, the allure of a big city in Northern England offers shops, suitors, sin and seduction. At least, that is what is being served up in The Paradise. Are we ready for one more English period drama in which the costumes star as much as the actors? Of course we are. The 1880's are one of the prettiest fashion decades ever with ruffles, folds, pleats, bustles, lace, decollette, and the hour-glass silhouette accompanied by a parasol and a fetching hat. The men are dapper, too.

In this series, country girl Denise Lovett (Joanna Vanderham of WHAT MAISIE KNEW) is hired to work at The Paradise shop by the shop's deeply dimpled, bedroom-eyed owner, Mr. John Moray (Emun Elliott of BLACK WATCH and GAME OF THRONES). Whispered rumors of the suspicious death of Moray's rich young wife swirl around Lovett. Although Moray is courting another lady, Katherine Glendenning (Elaine Cassidy of HARPER'S ISLAND) from a gentrified family of wealth, it's clear to us, the audience, that Moray is intensely attracted to our country lass Lovett. And his intentions toward the innocent Lovett may not be honorable. Part of the dramatic tension is that you can't tell if Moray is a total cad, or might be redeemable and protect young Lovett's virtue.

Is Lovett attracted to him? Possibly, almost certainly, but she confesses she doesn't want to marry him, she wants to BE him. She is creative, spirited and plucky, so she may be a match for his ambition.

Based on the 1883 Emile Zola novel ""Au Bonheur des Dames"" (""The Ladies Paradise""), this production was created and written by Bill Gallagher who produced LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD. For those of us who can't get enough of these costumed English period dramas, this will probably be a five star bit of fluff, fripperies and frivolity for us.",1381363200,2,1823,4.817891373801917
