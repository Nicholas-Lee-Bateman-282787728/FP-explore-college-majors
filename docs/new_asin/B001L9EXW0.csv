3682766,4,B001L9EXW0,"I was impressed with the quality and crispness of the video even though it is not Blu-Ray and made in 1995. I consider currently made DVDs to be excellent and Blu-rays to be exceptional. That being said, the background music takes precedence over the narration ( I found it nearly boring--even thou the music is not bad at all. I would have appreciated more information on the locations being filmed. As another reviewer commented, the video does not capture all of Arizona (which is a shame). I visited Safford several years ago and camped out at the state park on the south side of town with Mt. Graham rising majestically to the south--almost like Mt San Jacinto above Palm Springs, CA. All the video showed was a cotton field and labeled it Safford on the screen. Four stars because I really thought the images were sharp and convey a sense of what AZ has to offer. On the other hand 2 stars for the narrative info provided and three stars for not covering more of the state.",1393286400,4,979,4.536723163841808
3682767,4,B001L9EXW0,"Bought this after a trip to Sedona Arizonia...In person is much better...but if you are unable to make the trip,  this video is the next best thing!  Highly recommend to everyone!",1388793600,,179,4.741935483870968
3682768,3,B001L9EXW0,"I was just in and all over most of Arizona last month, and I can say that this is a pretty basic look at this beautivul state and its many wonderments. Didn't even mention Tombstone, a very cool place, or Prescott ( pronounced ""Prescut"" by the locals), which I thought was one of the most beautiful areas in the state. The drive there from Jerome on a long winding steeply ascending road up to over 7,000' in elevation, well, the view is pretty spectacular. They left quit a bit of potential content out. Add 10 more minutes and show more stuff! The picture quality is also pretty poor. Like watching a vhs tape. I don't know why they would release something with this picture quality in this day and age. But it's watchable. 3 stars because this could have, and should have been much better content wise as well as picture quality. But I think its still worth a watch because the content that it does have is worth seeing.",1386633600,,923,4.435294117647059
3682769,4,B001L9EXW0,"The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is for the length, it's shorter than other similar ""Over"" programs.  Overall the scenery is breathtaking and the narration is very informative.",1376956800,,182,4.870967741935484
3682770,5,B001L9EXW0,"We watched this before we went on our trip to New Mexico. we were so glad to see what would Arizona look like, this is true to the area.",1372377600,,136,3.7241379310344827
3682771,5,B001L9EXW0,"I am originally from AZ, but left in 96. Over Arizona took me home and more! It made me proud to be from such an awe inspiring state that most people think of as a hot desert...Over Arizona takes you to the highest snow covered peaks to the amazing Grand Canyon, to the Superstition Mountains..I just can't say enough good things about this dvd...BUY IT and see for yourself!",1350777600,2,375,4.449275362318841
3682772,3,B001L9EXW0,"What this vid covers -- Arizona's astonishing beauty -- it covers pretty well. Nice camera work and really good voice work here.

But it's hard to credit that an overview of Arizona would omit so much. This vid has neither Canyon de Chelly nor the chasms of the Little Colorado River that lead into the Grand Canyon. There is nothing of the dinosaur tracks at Tuba City. No mention of the Four Corners where four states converge on a single point. None of the stunning vistas along the eastern side of the state.

I teach on the Navajo reservation, and bought this video with intentions of using it as an adjunct in lessons on local civics and history. But so much has been left out -- without telling us this in advance, before we bought it -- that it's just a curiosity. My students would want to know why their entire part of Arizona got stiffed. As do I.",1297123200,15,858,4.389937106918239
3682773,3,B001L9EXW0,"This is what I have always wanted to be able to see. A view of mother earth and her cities, country's landscapes, that I would have never seen otherwise in my life. My disappointment however is that I have never been able to find an overhead view dvd of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, that would be worth the effort and time to watch it.  Take the ad like commercialism out of such a product.  I would pay a thousand bucks or more for such a product from one end to the other of that canyon and river, that which I could watch over and over for the rest of my life (now 81).",1267228800,3,584,4.025862068965517
3682774,1,B001L9EXW0,"Delivered with broken, un-usable case. Neither was it totally sealed, so I suspect it was previously returned. This widescreen DVD was produced in 1995 so sound and video quality are quite poor and to top it off, the production is only 30 minutes long, not the 60 minutes advertised. It was sold through ""pieceofmindmedia"" by Amazon for $10.43 including shipping, instead of the $14.99 list price but, in my opinion, it is worth only $4.99! Do not buy this DVD!",1254355200,14,461,4.775
