7791069,5,0789421542,"My 2 yr-old is obsessed with monkeys. He asks to see monkeys everyday. We read books and even took him to the zoo, but it is not enough. So although we don't let him watch TV, we broke down and bought this video to keep at Grandma's house. :) He loves it! It's the perfect length to keep him engaged. It's packed with live action footage of monkeys in their natural habitat, which is what he's fascinated by. The short cartoon bits are amusing and benign. Most importantly there are no boring humans, doing boring human stuff (like other videos we've tried). Just monkeys and apes and more monkeys! Exactly what the kid is craving to see.",1011657600,9,638,4.461538461538462
