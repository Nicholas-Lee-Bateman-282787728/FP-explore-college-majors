5089588,5,B007ISJS4Q,"Patterns are the narrator's basis of math. He ponders what be believes to be ""THE CODE"". Unlike the fictional farce `Da Vinci's Code', this code makes some sense--even to the non-math geniuses (like me). But Marcus du Sautoy, Oxford professor that can be understood, visits such interesting places to demo math--like a travelogue almost. It is both intellectual and BBC2 entertaining--not just for math geeks. Probably mild for the advanced math scholars. Negative numbers is the only non-positive part of this DVD set.

The Code = Math Equations. The code is natural patterns, math, that can be decoded--well, sometimes. Actually it's closer to Leonardo than you might think, for those of us who have studied Da Vinci for real. Google knows `The Code' and uses it constantly.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 episodes.
~~1 NUMBERS
Chartres Cathedral --were the numbers used in the structure's architecture from God, as clergy claim? Or a hidden code? Cicada's 13-yr life cycle is also a mystery--and a prime number. Then there is the 17-yr cicada (another prime number). The episode applies numbers to music/sounds. Pi (not pie) is part of the interconnectedness & puzzling Code. Then Marcus tells us about `i' (Imaginary numbers) and as he states: ""the mathematical equivalent of believing in fairies."" That `i' understood!
~~2 SHAPES
Northern Ireland's Giant's Causeway -folklore & math phenomenon that appears to cross the Irish Sea. Hexagons! Like a bee's honeycomb. What of shapers? Soap bubbles prove economic solutions in nature. Even snowflakes offer a surprise that shows nature's complexity of shapes. Fractal math is fascinating shape use--enter Pixar. A fun segment.
~~3 PREDICTION
Bird migration uses a code -pattern of behavior -for travel. Nature has much predictability -like lunar eclipses. Du Sautoy demonstrates his faith in the power of The Code knowledge and use. But he calls it `the code of chaos.' Random cause and effect can cause a huge change. Learn much about it.
~~BONUS four minutes each of 3 math shorts on Phi, Reproducing, & M.C. Escher, all causing the viewer to want more. Viewer's guide.
Du Sautoy also was responsible for another excellent math documentary series:

5089611,4,B007ISJS4Q,This series got better as it went along.  I watched in on Amazon as part of my Acorn subscription.  The characters are well drawn.  The whole subject of co-dependency is explored in a sensitive way.  And the characters learn and grow through the plot.  It is a very compelling story  - scary that it might be true to life.  I also loved seeing the Australian landscape.,1484179200,,369,4.5

5089644,1,B007ISJS4Q,"Amazon Video's page for ""The Code"" is misleading.  The descriptions of the episodes, and the pictures attached, show an Australian tv mystery series.  What Amazon delivers, however, is something very different: a series of BBC lectures on mathematics (presumably from a BBC series also entitled ""The Code"").

5089669,3,B007ISJS4Q,"""The Code"" seems to mean simply ""mathematics"" - any mathematics. As such, it is an ambiguous term, applied to anything that seems to have a pattern or lack of a pattern that mathematics finds a way to represent formulaically.

5089673,5,B007ISJS4Q,"Excellent program.
Not only is the subject matter presented in easy-to-understand layman's terms, the examples and demonstrations are highly entertaining. Though the subject matter is complex at times, I believe the host does an excellent job, speaking in clear ,easy-paced sentences, to give the viewer time to absorb what is being said and the concepts being presented..
When he is interviewing an expert he shows appropriate respect, and though he himself is a well respected mathematician, he is humble in the presence of other accomplished experts and scientists.
I only wish there were more episodes!!!",1400889600,,608,5.410526315789474

5089675,2,B007ISJS4Q,"I was sadly disappointed in Numbers.  As someone who knows the subject matter and was looking for a deeper understanding of the constants of nature and the mysteries of mathematics I was severly let down.  Although I do suppose that as an introductory video to get the attention of students and such it would work well.  Thing is, really what Cooter was talking about throughout the bulk of the episode was the Golden Ratio, but it was never talked about.  He got close, but never really delved into the full depth of the mystery of it.  I mean really how can you talk about the Nautilus and not even bring up Fibonnacci.  I was also disappointed to see that the number 'e' was not covered; that's a number that will blow your mind.  Perhaps it wasn't covered because you would need to show some math to get to the heart of e, and Numbers was very light on the math.  Maybe without the two flashback sequencies they could have put some more info in there.

The detailed description of how music and dis-harmonies work was cool, though.  And like I said probably very helpful to get someone interested in the subject matter.  But as someone who has been on the lookout for a non-mathematics' tutorial on all the crazyness that is mathematics, this didn't do it for me.",1400803200,12,1267,4.5131578947368425
5089676,4,B007ISJS4Q,The first episode looks at the mathematical relationships between the natural world and seeing these relationships as functions of the concepts and abstractions of math. It was fun-a bit reminiscent of James Burke's series called Connections.,1400457600,,242,5.75
5089677,1,B007ISJS4Q,"I don't remember it that well, so this review may not be fair. But it wasn't memorable, not at all.",1400371200,,99,4.0
5089678,5,B007ISJS4Q,Very interesting and well done  great fact giving in the amount of time  very enjoyable and makes you thing and look at things differently,1398643200,,138,4.708333333333333
5089679,2,B007ISJS4Q,"Why bother?

If you're looking for a pseudoscientific 'mystical' outlook on math and it's relationship to reality, well, look no further.
If you are, however, interested in reality and how it relates to math, look for a book.

Amongst other things, the author misunderstands psychoacoustics, and makes grandiose statements, in a way which not only makes him look stupid, but by extension, all scientific thought.",1398211200,2,412,5.323076923076923

The kids always like the cicada part of episode 1, the bubbles in episode 2, and the jelly beans in episode 3.

I don't feel as if I learned very much.
I guess the title was misleading (at least to me). The author conveyed a sense of wonder but never tied in the mathematics angle. I could enjoy the examples without understanding his ""Code"" explanations.
He would write advanced problems /solutions on napkins/paper and suggest the math explained it all. I guess I look at the same subject through different eyes.",1363219200,2,479,4.714285714285714

8517757,1,B007ISJS4Q,"Why does Amazon refuse to fix this content mix-up?!? Why does the Video Team refuse to fix the mixed-up episodes in season 1? Why does Amazon seem to be ignoring countless Reviews pointing out the problem (not to mention many calls & emails)? Why is it so hard to deconflict the Australian ficitonal series & the BBC Documentary series - Both called ""The Code""? Seriously, it should take 10-15 minutes to update this page so it links the 1st few episides to the Austrailian ""Code"" instead of the BBC ""Code""!  Where is the attention to detail, customer serivce, repsonse to customer reviews, & the willingness to fix this long-standing problem?!? The fact that this issue gone unfixed for so many months is embarassing for the Amazon Video team & hugely disappointing & frustrating for Amazon customers trying to purchase the right content!

I first watched Season 1 of the amazing Australian Tech / Political thriller called ""The Code"" on Netflix & absolutely loved it.

I was thrilled to see it finally show up on Amazon Video through ""Acorn TV"" & immediately purchased the season 1.  As countless others have pointed out, although the pic for ""The Code Season 1"" is correct & the main show description plus the episode descriptions all correctly describe the the Australian fictional series, at least 1 but more likely the 1st 3 episodes are from the BBC Documentary Series also called ""The Code"".

So basically, half of Season 1 is the wrong series!

Over the past 9-12 months I have called Amazon Video Support & sent ~5 extremely detailed emails thoroughly & clearly explaining the problem. BUT AFTER ALMOST A YEAR, THIS CONTENT MIX-UP STILL HASN'T BEEN FIXED BY AMAZON!

This is so frustrating, since I loved the series on Netflix & am basically just waiting & waiting to purchase the CORRECT Season 1 from Amazon Video.

Between the countless Customer Reviews pointing out this problem & my repeated phone calls & emails to Amazon Support, I simply can't understand why this STILL hasn't been fixed!

BTW, I think at some point, I'm pretty sure that this page actually linked the to BBC Documentary of the same name. I checked the oldest reviews & started working backwards & the oldest review pages specifically & only reference the BBC Documentary Series...

On the plus side, Acorn TV finally allowed the purchase of Season 2 of the advertised series (the right one / the Australian fictional thriller, etc.). Initially, you had to subscribe to Acorn TV in order to watch & there was no option to purchase Season 2.  However, I was nervous given my problems purchasing Season 1 as described above & by many, many other Reviewers.

I am happy to report that ALL EPISODES of Season 2 are for the correct series & they're also available in HD.

NOW, IF ONLY AMAZON / ACORN TV WOULD FINALLY FIX SEASON 1 THEN I WOULD PURCHASE IMMEDIATELY!

I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE AMAZON VIDEO TEAM HAS ALLOWED THIS MISTAKE TO REMAIN UNCORRECTED FOR SO LONG & HOW AMAZON HAS CONSISTENTLY FRUSTRATED & HUGELY DISAPPOINTED SO MANY LOYAL AMAZON CUSTOMERS.

PLEASE AMAZON, IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR ALMOST A YEAR, COULD YOU FINALLY JUST *FIX SEASON 1*?!?

""JUST FIX IT!""

Thanks?,
