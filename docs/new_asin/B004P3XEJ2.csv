4443839,4,B004P3XEJ2,"I didn't see anything new in this DVD.
However, my problem is I have too much information, tips, and drills from here and there.
To me, this DVD is a concise collection of necessary component of golf swing.
Overall, nice job.",1327622400,4,225,4.512195121951219
4443840,4,B004P3XEJ2,Great production! Nothing new but I understand and LOVE the way the swing is presented and explained. Good DVD and I would reccommend it to a friend.,1326931200,3,149,4.555555555555555
4443841,5,B004P3XEJ2,"I was lucky enough to have Sean Foley give me some impromptu instruction during the Tiger Woods Chevron pro am last week and boy did my shots improve on course. I decided to get the DVD. Least I could do after the free lesson. Notably for those who might not be as lucky, is that everything he told me was in the DVD and besides that was much more and deeper info, and real world (not goofy) drills.

I am headed out to the range right now to work on these drills systematically, figuring if the basics helped my striking that immediately, it can only get better with a month of drilling. Also some brief but very helpful short game instruction in this DVD, which is all I needed as a mid handicap. The rest is up to me putting in the time.",1323216000,5,740,4.174825174825175
4443842,4,B004P3XEJ2,"This video has helped me a lot as it differs from common golf teaching. It is not for beginners as it does not have a lot of details as the leadbeter 4 DVD, but attacks, in my opinion, the most important issues on a non beginner golf swing.",1310601600,5,240,4.020833333333333
4443843,5,B004P3XEJ2,"Simple and straight to the point. Of course Sean didn't revile all of his secrets, but his DVD will definitely start you in the right direction. I love how he takes the hands out of play promoting hitting with your core instead (my words not his).  A MUST BUY!",1374624000,3,260,4.3061224489795915
4443844,5,B004P3XEJ2,"First of all let me premise by saying I have been playing golf since I was 9 years old and currently carry a 4 handicap. I have read many, many books, viewed many DVD's and taken lots of lessons from pros at various courses and facilities.
  I had heard of Sean Foley mostly due to the fact that he was Tiger Wood's new swing coach. I was likely like many others that thought "" why the heck is this guy tinkering with his swing after so much success?"" Then you would see Tiger on the course struggling to keep the ball in play and hitting it all over the place and I thought like many others "" this Sean Foley guy must be a quack job and he is going to ruin Tiger Woods.""
  Last week, I decided to take a leap of faith and buy this DVD. I had been struggling for the last few months with my swing and had been looking for a change. I like so many had been told that ""loading up my right side"" was the way to properly swing and have had pretty good success over the years with this swing until recently.
  Well folks, Sean Foley is the real deal, plain and simple. His DVD is broken down in very simple sections and his techniques work. Yes, some of the drills appear to be the same as others have told us before, but some are not and very unique and simple. While I have not studied this DVD or his techniques backward and forwards like I usually do, I went out for a round and applied some of his basic techniques and the results were immediate. I was much more accurate, my ball flight was much better and my hits were much more solid. I has actually hitting the ball further due to hitting consistently in and or very close to the sweet spot of all of my clubs which presented some distance problems, but that is something that is easily fixed.
  Bottom line, buy this DVD and apply Sean's techniques to your game, you will be glad you did!",1371427200,,1843,4.128491620111732
4443845,5,B004P3XEJ2,Great DVD for all levels of golfers. Sean Foley is one of the best teachers in the world. I really enjoyed and understood the DVD>,1370390400,,130,4.24
4443846,4,B004P3XEJ2,"Nothing really new or profound here.  Organized in a perhaps slightly different way.  Fairly quick presentation and accompanying drills.
Be careful, it's not terribly clear that you actually receive two disks with same content - one in DVR format, the other in BluRay format..

Overall impression - a good overview of the things Foley think is important.",1363478400,2,354,5.175438596491228
4443847,3,B004P3XEJ2,"As an avid golfer who is into fitness, I was looking forward to see what Sean Foley's take on golf mechanics and swing would be. The DVD set is nothing special. Was expecting  a different take on the golf swing or physics of golf swing.  It doesn't supplant most of ideas found in other DVD series or on the web.  Two DVD set with each disc having almost the same content (lessons and drills).  The series has about 15 good drills (glove, towel, impact bag, left arm only etc). These are good and can be found on any website or you tube.  The DVD doesn't address grip.  So if your a new to golf, it may not serve you well.  I think you need a good working understanding of the golf swing to understand some of the few concepts discussed. I would rank this DVD series 4th among popular series out there ( Watsons-Lessons of a life time/Nicklaus-Golf My way/Hank Haney).",1357862400,,868,4.354037267080745
4443848,4,B004P3XEJ2,Easy to watch and relate to.  Watching a good swing to emulate makes practicing much easier.  Hoping to buy more in the future.,1355616000,,127,4.478260869565218
4443849,4,B004P3XEJ2,Nothing here that won;t help a good to very good golfer.  One tires of the self-aggrandizement.  He's got a lot of winners so he must know his stuff.  the more I watch any of the vids the more it all comes back to Jim Hardy and the One Plane Swing.,1355356800,2,248,3.92
4443850,1,B004P3XEJ2,I cannot believe that someone with Sean Foley's reputation would produce a rather expensive instructional DVD that is nothing more than reciting and demonstrating the very basics of the golf swing.  He is obviously capitalizing on his new-found notoriety and threw together a DVD to cash in a bit!  Nothing exceptional here.  Don't waste your money!,1334620800,3,349,5.196428571428571
4443851,5,B004P3XEJ2,"I am a 65-year-old male and have always suffered from lack of distance due to short stature and slight build. I probably own more books and tapes/dvds than anyone within 100 miles, but all the confusing information has not improved my long game a bit, and I only play to a 10 handicap because I hit the ball straight and putt really well.

The main focus of this product is the full golf swing, although it also addresses the short game and putting. Foley gives sufficient credit to his predecessors for a few of the drills and other concepts that have helped him understand and communicate how to learn the swing, but his teaching is a marvelous synthesis that presents the true essentials in a straighforward, no-nonsense approach. Some elements come from stack-and-tilt, others come from Jim Hardy's one plane swing, and even others from points emphasized by Hogan or the many analysts of his swing.

Most of the drills are simple and can be done inside at home. Others that involve hitting balls can be done in a basement or at an indoor range. The drills address specific areas like balance, connectedness, and proper sequence, and Foley explains what each drill intends to accomplish so you have a clear image in your head of what you are trying to do. No silly gadgets or artificial devices except an impact bag you can make yourself, and a couple of items to improve balance that can be improvised at home.

I have never encounted a more lucid explanation of what needs to be done and how to do it. The logic is clear. Better balance leads to solid ball contact. Striking the ball at the right place on the swing arc leads to better control of direction. Good mechanics lead to more distance with less effort and a smaller chance of injury. Foley is hot right now because his players have been winning, but I think he is much more than a passing fad. This instruction is very well planned and presented as a complete package. It applies to anyone who really wants to learn this game and is willing to put in the time although it assumes the viewer has at least a little knowledge about how to hold the club, etc.",1332892800,7,2120,4.544502617801047
4443852,5,B004P3XEJ2,"While I initially thought that the dvd did not have enough information on it to be worth the money, after properly working through the exercises, I find this is a very good instructional dvd and my swing and game is improving. I finally get, from the dvd, all the previous things I've been told by other instructors. Somehow, it makes sense the way this is set up and the way he puts things.

Only thing to be aware of is that he does not go over the very basics, such as a proper grip. I learned that elsewhere and then found this dvd. good timing:)

I also don't know that I'd recommend for anyone new to golf, but if you have the basics of grip, this would be a good next step.",1330646400,5,680,4.143939393939394

8437454,4,B004P3XEJ2,"Re: the title: Bing Crosby, perhaps the most prolific recording artist in American history, was as passionate about golf as music.  He lived for music and, esp. when paired with Louis Armstrong, could swing with the best jazz musicians of his time. But his involvement with golf--as tournament sponsor, owner of golf courses and a low-handicap, competitive player--betrayed such a deep and complete love of the game that, upon announcement of his fatal heart attack on a golf course, the public could only receive the news with shock and sadness followed by a certain ""satisfaction"" (""Where else?"").

 In a lifetime of playing the game, I've never really enjoyed it--thanks to a wicked slice that has me spending most of my time not on the fairways but in the woods. It's gotten so bad that I measure my success not by how low I've shot but by how few balls I've lost in the course of 9 or 18 holes. So I was vulnerable to paying $20 for a Foley video that was pitched to me through e-mail. Fortunately, I stopped short of giving out my credit card information when I realized that the only thing I would receive would be 7 minutes' worth of a time-sensitive video that would probably self-destruct after viewing. Then I remembered Amazon--and, of course, here it is--not merely a single lesson but an entire course in golf by Sean Foley--all for the price of a used copy ($1.50).

The only golf publications I've read up to this point are Ben Hogan's ""Power Golf,"" which got me going--though I've never found that grip--loose, not fully interlocking--either comfortable or especially effective. The other item was the ""Little Red Book."" I'm still slicing, so apparently neither book was of much help. Outside of ""rock hard hams,"" I have good upper and lower body flexibility--enough to do a fairly decent impersonation of John Daly or The Shark or Tiger. But at the point where the club-face makes contact with the ball, something always seems to go awry. Obviously, the club face simply isn't ""facing"" the ball or it would leap from the tee in a high and forward straight path.

It's a matter of split second timing to get the clubhead turned on the ball at the precise microsecond before contact. Failing that, it's off to the familiar adult Easter egg hunt. Fortunately, there's an alternative for the ""duffer"" who can become humble enough to follow Foley's instructions--which are employed at the expense of looking like an ""old geezer."" (You've seen them, celebrating their 7th or 8th decade of playing the game. Nowadays they bring the club half-way back to a 90-degree angle and then bring it forward, same speed and motion except the other way--not so much ""swinging"" at the ball as ""whacking"" at it with a scythe-like movement.)

I've got to admit that--cosmetics aside--it feels good just to see the ball go straight--and then to realize that it was ""crooked you"" who made it go straight. I haven't had this much fun since my last croquet match.",1510185600,,2956,4.786274509803921
