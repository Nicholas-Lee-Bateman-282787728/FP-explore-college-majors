4865165,3,B005S9EJGO,"The Raven was a much more enjoyable experience than all the negative reviews that I read from the critics lead me to believe. A serial killer is dispatching people in the same fashion as the victims in the works of the 18th century poet Edgar Allan Poe. The police are stumped, so they call upon the brooding man himself. Think Abraham Licoln Vampire Hunter meets Sherlock Holmes, you know, a real historical figure's life changed for entertainment value. John Cusack does a very good job playing Edgar Allan Poe, injecting Poe's personality traits in often humerous ways and his hatred for rival writers of the time. John Hawkes is my choice for a true telling of Poe's life, but Cusack fits the part in this fictional take on the last few days of the poet's life.

The Raven is not great or really that memorable, but the atmosphere, mystery and John Cusack's performance held my interest enough to recommend seeing it once it hits DVD.",1335571200,3,938,4.684848484848485
4865166,2,B005S9EJGO,"John Cusack is awesome. Or at least he used to be. I'm guilty of loving his ventures into thriller and horror like Identity and 1408, but haven't been a big fan of his recent efforts. 2012 was a complete mess and Hot Tub Time Machine was kind of okay at best. Since he was working with James McTeigue (director of V For Vendetta) and was set to play Edgar Allen Poe (what horror fan doesn't like Poe?), I was hoping for a movie that was at least entertaining. But then early reviews started coming out and they were more than a little negative. Its poor rating on Rotten Tomatoes didn't exactly whet my appetite and the lousy attendance of fellow movie critics at the screening (there was one other Houston critic there other than me) only made matters worse. Was there any way that people were wrong? Maybe its greatness just flew over their heads. I wish I could give you a reason to go into this with a positive mindset, but it's really hard with what lies within The Raven.

Edgar Allen Poe's most well-known and gruesomely horrific tales are brought to life in Baltimore by an unknown killer. But in the meantime, let's see how poor and drunk Poe gets on a daily basis. The first half of the movie is devoted to showing what a has-been Poe has become. He's lost his inspiration, he can't get published, and nobody in Baltimore really cares about him or his work. Poe is pathetic as he's seen groveling for a drink, ranting to the newspaper editor, and attempting to keep Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) in his life. But as the killer's carnage is revealed to be inspired by Poe's works, he's dragged into the investigation by Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and somehow becomes the hero of the story.

John Cusack tries really hard to make The Raven somewhat decent. His portrayal of Poe is the best part of the movie. But everything around him is so flat and preposterous that you can't appreciate it. Some of the camera techniques are intriguing as well like the way the camera goes into and comes out of a keyhole at the beginning of the movie.

Unfortunately, there aren't any other favorable qualities for The Raven. Luke Evans was trying too hard to do a Michael Shannon impression with Christian Bale's scruffy Batman voice and I swear all I see when I look at Alice Eve is rabbit teeth. The Raven is unintentionally hilarious though. Griswold's (John Warnaby) pleas for his life while being strapped into the pendulum contraption are so bad they're humorous. There's the tunnel scene with the whistle blowing and shouting of ""EMILY!"" that was just awkward. The most ridiculous is the horse chase scene though. Detective Fields is shot and Poe decides to go after the killer himself. Should I send one of my best men after the killer? Nah. An alcoholic who's lost everything and isn't thinking clearly is the much better option. The line Fields yells is one of the worst in the movie. ""After him, Poe! GO!""

The Raven is very slow moving and once it gets going it isn't very satisfying. The first big trap is the pendulum sequence, which is bogged down by really shady computer effects. The trap was executed more efficiently in Saw V. Really iffy CG is sprinkled throughout The Raven though whether it's something as simple as fog covering the cobblestone streets of Baltimore or a drop of blood falling from the beak of a computer generated raven or adding effects to an elaborate trap from Poe's repertoire. That's the other thing. These killings are supposed to be inspired by the works of Poe, but most people die from a simple cut to the throat or the wrists. The creative side of one of the most brilliant minds in horror has been thrown out for something much more simple-minded.

The Raven is an excessive mess that would leave Edgar Allen Poe chewing on his own eyeballs just to avoid seeing this thing if he was still alive today. It's like a combination of Saw and From Hell with John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe as the protagonist for no other reason other than to capitalize on Poe's name. The Raven is a slow, uninspired, and miserable excuse of a thriller that can't lay claim to anything other than tarnishing one of the most influential writers the world has ever known.",1335484800,8,4191,4.590120160213618
4865167,4,B005S9EJGO,"I've just seen the film today, and I wanted to share some thoughts in response to those often annoying and simply wrong movie critics in ""The New York Times"", ""USA Today""...and well my local paper ""The Columbus Dispatch"". Essentially, the critics have given the film thumbs down, but don't be fooled. The film is quite good and enjoyable and mostly hits all the right notes and deserves credit for mixing various genres into a unique hybrid. Is it a horror film? A period piece? A biography? A thriller? A mystery? Noir? A romance? Yep, all of the above.

Just off the top of my head, I'd like to address some of the points the aforementioned critics mentioned in their negative reviews:

* One critic actually had to point out that the movie isn't a version of the poem ""The Raven"". It's as if the critic wasn't aware the Poe himself became known as The Raven, thus the title of the film.

* The film was criticized for turning Poe into an action-hero-detective. I'd just like to point out the Poe was considered a great athlete and did serve in the Army. The Poe that aides in the investigation of serial killings would not have been too inconsistent with the real Poe's physical prowess, though certainly at that stage in his life he was in poor physical condition, mostly due to poverty and depression over the death of his wife. Which leads me to the next point...

* It seems the critics won't allow the fans to have a flight of fantasy regarding Poe's last days, which are historically vague--perhaps even debatable. There are several different explanations and accounts as to what happened. A film that would have been an accurate biopic would have been rather depressing and subject to debate and inconstistencies. But this film has a vision and a version of Poe and sticks with it. So there wouldn't have been much fun taking the route of making a pure biopic film. Yet, there are several films that do, though they are truly more biographical in natural. They are: ""Poe: Terror of the Soul""; and The Learning Channel's biograogt of Poe, whose name escapes me. Then there's A&E's Bio of Poe. No...clearly this isn't what the makers of this film were after. And that's a good thing in this case, although the aforementioned films are excellent in their own regard.

* Poe has been considered wrongly to be an ever falling-down drunk incapable of little more. Although there certainly was that component to his personality; this film was able to portray the other side of Poe, especially his sharp mind and witticisms and his romantic nature, and you can attribute that to John Cusack's excellent performance. And besides, isn't it true that women often fall for flawed men? So why could we not see Poe in such a relationship with a beautiful woman who cannot help falling for him. A tired troupe perhaps, but find me a film that's 100% original.

* Some critics has condemned Cusack's perforamce because he didn't get the subtleties of Poe's language right and that particular period in Baltimore's history. Really is that possible? Now think about if for a second as Poe live a rather itinerant life and consider the time period. Quite simply this: There are no recordings of Poe's voice. Nobody knows what he sounded like. He was raised to be a southern gentelmen; he probably did have a southern accent; yet he attended school in England, and later, which is well documented, lived up north. Who the heck knows exactly how Poe spoke? If Cusack played it was a southern drawl it would have been out-of-place.

* The strength of the movie is that the writers were able to make Poe a sympathic, and yes tragic hero, instead of the neurotic he's often depicted.

* Now, SPOILER ALERT. The pitch of the movie was to sepculate regarding those last days of his life. Poe's making the fatal decision to take the poison to spare his beloved's life, invested a rather romantic quality to the fictional Poe that I think the real Poe probably had. Being an avid reader and admirer of his work and admittedly sympathetic to his tragic life, I think that given the choice presented to him in real life, Poe would have drank the poison to spare his belove'd life. I also think the real Poe would have made a competent amateur detective as he did in this film, because the real Poe had a gifted mind, especially in the fine art of ratiocination. Though again, in truth, the real Poe at the time was not in the physical shape and frame of mind as the Poe in the film.

* But that's my point: the fans are allowed to have their speculation; they are willing to suspend their disbelief; they are willing to allow the film-makers certain historical liberties when they are done well; the fans know this a fictional film. Again, contrary to what the professional critics have written about this film, they do that...and more, especially in creating some very DREARY atmosphere and some well-staged shock sequences, and a rather intersting mystery to boot. What if Poe really died that why? What a truly Poe way to go!

* All-in-all, I give the film two thumbs up, and I implore you to dismiss the critics and go see the movie for yourself. And undoubtedly, some of you more learned Poe aficionados out there can append to some of the points I have made.

*Should you watch this film? Evermore! Critics be hanged. Evermore!",1335484800,5,5313,4.647497337593184
4865168,4,B005S9EJGO,"On October 3, 1849 Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore, delirious, calling out the name Reynolds. There have been lots of theories as to what Poe died of, from tuberculosis, rabies or to a drunken bender. ""The Raven"" puts forth a more romantic theory and a detective story for the man who invented the modern detective novel.

""The Raven"" as a movie demonstrates that you can make a movie that bridges the biographical facts of Poe's life and its own artistic vision and still make an interesting movie. The movie is driven by the premise, a serial killer starts a series of killings in Baltimore that emulate some of the more gruesome murders in Poe's stories. When the first murder is done inside a locked room, police detective Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes it as the setting of an Edgar Allan Poe story. Fields brings in Poe (John Cusack) at first as suspect, but when another murder occurs Poe quickly becomes the first criminal profiler and consultant. Poe helps Fields both in what kind of mind the killer may have and of course in the details from his stories. The killer kidnaps Poe's girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) with the killer promising clues as to Emily's whereabouts with each new murder he commits.

The filmmakers, director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingstone and Hannah Shakespeare don't try to recast Poe's character as a superhero or give the movie Poe attributes that the real Poe didn't or couldn't possess. As mentioned before, the filmmakers stick fairly accurately to the known elements of Poe's last few days, although there are some artistic liberties taken, and they still present an entertaining movie with a few twists and turns as to who the murderer is.

Cusack is spot on as Poe from his look, thin with a black mustache and goatee, to (more importantly) Poe's character. Poe was a writer who had the ultimate confidence in his own abilities as a writer and was dismissive of his contemporaries, especially if they were more successful. Cusack is supported by a cast that hits every note right.

If you think a movie about Edgar Allan Poe won't have enough action for you, this is a movie for you. If you're more literary minded and think this movie will have too many inaccuracies or violate Poe's character or will throw in too much action, you won't be disappointed.",1335484800,102,2334,4.784119106699752

4865204,4,B005S9EJGO,"I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. I don't think it is an accurate portrayal of Edgar, but I like the fact they made this into a detective style movie using his novel writings. A murderer is on the loose in 1849 Baltimore and using Edgar Allan Poe's writing works as his inspiration.
Don't look for a fast paced ""bomb in your face"" type of movie here folks. This is a drama that is fairly slow in pace. I liked it though and the scenery/costumes used for the time period.
The movie runs about 2 hours 2 minutes in length with credits.

4865224,4,B005S9EJGO,"Fiery and passionate Edgar Allan Poe is outraged by his lack of success and makes no secret of insulting his competition and his critics. When those same people he hates start dying in ways he wrote about in his gothic tales, he is the top of the suspect list and forced to clear his name by helping the police catch the real murderer. The Raven is an unexpectedly enjoyable film that melds true events of Poe's life with a fictional murder mystery. John Cusak plays Poe over the top with egotism, arrogance, indulgence in his vices, and a romantic side. I appreciated the decision to avoid sanitizing his character or making him into a one dimensional hero. He still works as hard as he can to stop the killer and regrets the use of his stories in this situation.

The film is surprisingly romantic, focusing much of the film on Poe's relationship with Emily. Emily's father makes no secret of his hatred for Poe, but that doesn't deter him at all. Their romance is sweet and clandestine with some playful disagreements and banter back and forth. I was surprised that Emily was portrayed as more intelligent and capable than I expected. It was a refreshing departure from genre tropes. The delightfully gruesome murders bring to life Poe's stories as I've never seen. Some of the murders were based on stories I wasn't familiar with and sparked my interest in reading more of Poe's work. The Raven has twists and turns to keep you guessing with good performances, suspense, and a fun mix of fact and fiction.",1478736000,,1509,4.672932330827067

4865298,4,B005S9EJGO,"This is a wonderful movie.  The story idea was inspired and we'll executed. It was appropriately dark and mysterious and had a thriller feel in parts.

It does take some time to build.

And yes I think that cop would have given him a gun.  We understood back then it is a tool used in self defense not a demon infecting people and forcing them to kill. Maybe the prop department should have gotten one more accurate to the times then again I'm no expert so I will just have to take one critic's word for it.  Still that hardly hurt this movie.

Now,  my review is somewhat biased.  I am a fan of Cusack.  And I have long been a fan of Poe and his dark yet often romantic poetry and stories.  He always struck me as a man so full of passion that got so little back from the world that he sunk into despair,  depression and anger.  I've felt that way myself especially faced with jealous rivals that would cut off their nose to spite their face if it meant cutting me too.  I definitely commiserate with him.

Sure we were told Poe was a jerky and a drunkard.  Many people that knew him hated him.  Of course he earned much of that animosity. He was very opinionated and aggressive at times.  Never tactful in telling the world exactly what he thought. I can see this in his criticism of his contemporaries and in his writing.

This movie takes that view I've had of him.  A brilliant mind,  a passionate and driven soul that has known bitter disappointment and ravaging grief at losses that began with his parents and never stopped.  Abandoned by his father his mother died when he was three and he was sent away from his siblings to be raised by a childless couple.  His step father didn't seem to understand him and few could then.  He was an artist as few we've ever seen and of course he wouldn't be able to settle into a life selling tobacco.

The movie must fill in gaps because of how little we really know about Poe's final days.  It takes some literary liberties but in a way that creates a gripping plot,  sympathetic heros and love as the driving force plot device for his final struggle.

Some have criticized this film because of this ""soft and forgiving""  portrayal of Por.  Not understanding how his girlfriend could love him.  I say this portrayal could be the truth and the slurs about him the posthumous defamation by rivals who got the last word.  I mean I absolutely believe he was a drunk,  belligerent and selfish and could scald you crimson with his sharp tongue.  I knew a guy just like this and being his friend was near impossible for me. Didn't stop my admiration for his talent.

I also believe he was addicted to opiates as common as it was in this Era and especially as he probably used it for whacked out dreams that helped his writing and the pain of TB if he did in fact have that also.  Artists from rock stars to painters and poets still seek that altered state today.  And so many of our most lauded were using when they created their masterpiece.

It's easy for me to believe he was loved by a good woman too (some reviewers  below were skeptical of this in the movie).  Women love all kinds of people for inexplicable reasons.  Men too for that matter.  Sometimes we see something in them and think if only we could help them heal,  stop drinking or doing drugs or change him.  It's a recipe for heartbreak or worse.  But that never stops us.  Probably so many like us grew up abused or neglected in some way and find ourselves drawn to the types of people we loved as children that hurt us.  In any account it's definitely plausible and even probable Poe had such a lady friend at the end.  Why hang up on that as an excuse to dislike the film?

As for what kind of man he was I find Cusack's portrayal believable and engaging.  He was a complicated man and a sinner.  So many of us are.  Poe lost the woman he loved quite tragically in his youth and others since.  It was a a dangerous time to be a woman with our ancient knowledge of our fertility buried under centuries of patriarchal Roman Catholic and later Protestant foolishness so that we didn't understand our bodies are all and men couldn't be bothered beyond what kept babies being pushed out and us quiet.  Hysteria coined in this era as if our uterus caused anxiety and despair and not the lack of personhood or body crippling corsets that didn't allow women to breathe.  Endless pregnancy with no break etc.  Add to that rampaging TB due to crowded cities with poor sanitation and over crowding.  It's a rare man that didn't grieve a lost mother or wife then and he was passionate in his grief and sorrow.  He was depressed.  He drank to dull it and drugged to numb it.  People still do today.  Does that make him a bad man? I unloved-able? Or human?

Maybe this is fantasy but I loved it and loved the idea of Poe reviving himself at the end enough to earn some redemption and even find himself again if only for a little while.  I believed he could easily have a psychopath obsessed with him.  They still are to this day.  And the man who created the crime story and inspired Doyle's Sherlock Holmes (along with his unusual friend) with the Murders at Rue Morgue could certainly help our movie detective profile and find this killer.  Who is a greater expert on Pope's works than himself to track a killer obsessed with them?

And watching some interesting documentaries it is far from agreed he died of TB.  He may have had it but there are various accounts saying he was poisoned or in some other way murdered perhaps by ""cooping""  (election rigging by drugging and kidnapping people..  Rookie votes.  Crazy stuff).

This movie could be as true to the real Poe as anything.  He was difficult to get along with and a scathing critic of his contemporaries.  So much so that his adversary Griswold (hiding behind the alias Ludwig)  waited until his death to defame him in his eulogy and later in a biography most of which was proven as libel.

That tells me Cusack's Poe is probably closer to reality.  In fact Griswold didn't have the courage to do so when Poe was alive to argue back makes me suspicious of his assertions that Poe was nothing but an abusive wastel and drunk.

Cusack is so talented and breathes such life into his characters and it's so strange he is not more popular in Hollywood which I suspect is politics and not due to his talent.

I really enjoyed this movie and I adding it to my library.  I hope everyone will set preconceptions aside and just watch and enjoy.  Then come back later after reading my review and others and watch it again and participate in the conversation.",1466812800,,6603,4.400662251655629

After all, Poes mind was twisted enough to come up with the stories. Its a race against time as Poe rushes to stop the killer who is making his ideas into reality.

4865446,4,B005S9EJGO,"Film director, James Mc Teigue, draws thematically on the poem The Raven and the poets life. The poem depicts the narrator lamenting over lost love, where the raven is a messenger from the land of the dead and a symbol of death. Even though the narrator is haunted by the lover and death, the poem asserts that although death conquers life it doesnt destroy love. This theme is embodied in the film where the fictitious Poe is prepared to surrender his life for his lover.
The film deviates from the poem and the facts of Poes life. Unlike, the poem, the film is a hybrid genre of historical fiction, Gothic horror, thriller and crime story. Laced with violence and gore, the film is not recommended for young viewers or the faint hearted. Mc Teigues thriller relies on a number of the Poes gruesome tales where a deranged fan sets about to re-enact some of Poes most grisly tales. He must be stopped before he works his way through Poes entire compilation of stories.

4865550,4,B005S9EJGO,"165 years ago, Edgar Allen Poe was on his way from Boston to Virgina, preparing for a new job. He never made it and was found on a bench in Baltimore, near death. He was delusional, wearing someone elses cloths, and kept repeating the name Reynolds, before he died. To this day, the cause of death and his reason for being in Baltimore are unknown. On the anniversary of his death, I decided to watch The Raven, which contrary to popular believe is not a remake of an older film. This story is a fictional take on Poe's last days, as the writers have Poe assisting local police in catching a serial killer. A killer is on the loose in Baltimore and using Poe's stories as the inspiration for his crimes, so who else is more qualified to help catch him than Poe? I am not a big fan of period dramas, as most are historically inaccurate and move at a snails pace, but the Raven was different. As fiction, it is of course extremely inaccurate and features Poe has an eccentric has been and a fall down drunk, but surprisingly the film is fast paced and really keeps you on the edge of your seat. The idea of using Poe's stories as the inspiration for a real murderer, who tries to copy his stories to the last detail was really brilliant and it plays very well, especially to fans of his work. John Cusack plays the mysterious writer and by this point in his career, I'm convinced that the man can play anyone and be believable. In thirty years, there isn't a role he wouldn't take on and I'm hard pressed to remember even one instance of him failing to be spectacular. The Raven is a stand alone film, with a common title for films featuring Poe, however this one is a great mystery that incorporates very little modern day thinking into the story. The Raven has everything you'd expect from this type of film, simply set 165 years ago. From police chases on horse back to wild 1800's costume parties, this film really surprised me with just how good it was and most definitely gets labeled as a must see movie!",1413158400,,2009,4.388739946380697

4865568,1,B005S9EJGO,"Terribly, TERRIBLY historically inaccurate movie. Poor Edgar Poe would be rolling in his grave with disgust. His stories were incorporated in a horrible way, and the plot, which twisted and turned and writhed drastically throughout the film, brought the story down incredibly. The stories did not mesh together well, and I feel the director had taken too much on his hands for one film.

What they have essentially done is taken Poe's stories and turned them all into one big murder fest, which Poe, the detective, has to go solve. (Mind you, he can't remember his own stories and has to refer back to them...uh, what? He wrote them. That doesn't make sense.) Cusack is a horrible Poe, making the character cold and uncharacteristic. The female protagonist, Poe's love interest, is a far cry from the actual love interest, Elmira Royster, who was Poe's real love interest towards the end of his life. I wanted to slap the character, she is so terrible (not the actress, however; she's a wonderful actress). Once again, another Poe adaptation has anthropomorphized Reynolds..of course. How clever. Bravo for your originality there.

This clich film has been added to my list of ""Forever Be the Death Of Me"" adaptations. I loathe to think watchers of this film will go spread information from it to their buddies..incorrect information which will further ruin the great writer's reputation. Thanks, James McTeigue..or should I say ""modern day Rufus Griswold."" (Yes, that is an insult.) Before you go and make another historical-based film, do your research, and spare my poor heart from this trash.",1406937600,,1596,5.041666666666667
4865569,1,B005S9EJGO,"I, the esteemed Dr. Rufus Wilmot Griswold, had composed a very critical review of ""The Raven"" that I had planned to share with everyone, but then absentmindedly flushed the toilet.  I was going to leave it at that, further consideration of the film being unworthy of my valuable time, but then remembered that I am long dead and time has ceased to exist for me.  The clamor of my legions of fans to know my thoughts on the film shall not go unanswered.

Here There Be Spoilers!!! If you've not yet seen ""The Raven"", don't.  If you do not intend to heed this advice, read on at your own peril.

I recently attended the cinema to see that great steaming pile of disappointed donkey droppings, ""The Raven"".  I spent eleven dollars and nearly two hours of my afterlife for the privilege of sitting in stunned silence amongst fewer than three dozen other movie-goers, all of whose enjoyment of the movie was at first spoilt by some creep hurling obscenities at the on-screen Poe... Until at length the usher told me to quiet down or I would be escorted out of the theater.  In the opinion of this reviewer this movie is classic `straight to video' fare, not even worthy of a theatrical release.

Named for the poem for which Poe is best known (despite the fact that Poe's `Raven' was but a barely altered plagiarism of `The Magpie' (1826) by Jefferson Tiberius Faulkmore (1799-1828), a forgotten minor poet so obscure that even I never anthologized his work), the absurdly contemptible premise of the film is that in Edgar Allan Poe's last days he is enlisted by a Baltimore detective to aid in the apprehension of a serial killer who is using the tales of the wretched poet as inspiration for his grisly crimes.  Most of the tales referenced in this way are done so in a very shallow manner showing little respect for Poe's original inventions, presenting the superficial and bloody details of Poe's work unencumbered by plot, atmosphere or psychological depth.

For the most part Poe's stories (or at least fragments of them) are simply used as throw away clues to propel the dissipated poet-turned-detective in the direction of the tedious film's easily anticipated conclusion.  The most prominent of the tales staged by the murderer (who ""went a little nuts"" (pauses for groans) as a result of Poe's diminished literary output) are ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"", the former being the most reminiscent of its original source material in the entire film.  The recreation of the ""Pit and the Pendulum"", however, is a disgrace (and not just because I meet my maker in that scene).  There is no pit, and the scene entirely omits the real horror of the tales predicament: that of the maddeningly slow descent of the blade.  The victim barely has time to anticipate his fate before he his cleaved in two in a poorly executed letting of computer generated blood.

Later in the film ""The Premature Burial"" is referenced, and I almost allowed myself to enjoy the stifling claustrophobia of the scene until the killer utters his first line, the laughable: ""Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.""  Pathetic!  Atrocious lines of dialogue abound, many of which spoken by Poe, making it difficult to regard the film as seriously as it so desperately wants to be regarded.  Shakespeare (Hannah, not William) and Ben Livingston, the ""writers"" of the film of whom the less said the better, should be pursued out of Hollywood by a torch-wielding mob for the profound ignorance regarding Poe's wit and demeanor exhibited by their script.

The entire cast was mediocre at best, but John Cusack's performance as Poe left much to be desired.  I recognized not a single measure of Poe in Cusack's flat, expressionless countenance.  The lazy music of Poe's voice, the supra-mortal eloquence possessed by the scribe in his better moments, his gentlemanly manner; they were all absent.  The fact that his ridiculous goatee makes him look less like a Southern gentleman & more like a depressed magician did nothing to help convince me that he was somehow conjuring the spirit of Poe as he seemed to believe he was in his arrogant and embarrassing comments to the entertainment press.

I've no complaint regarding the film's portrayal of Poe as a drunk, a drug addict, a madman & a litterbug; I am in fact pleased to see that my posthumous characterization of the Poet Inebriate is alive and well! It was pleasantly nostalgic to recall to mind Poe's suffering in his latter days when a friendless outcast.  I thank everyone involved in the production of ""The Raven"" for further congealing the bile in which I memorialized Poe.  I am compelled to mention, however, that the degraded wordsmith could not have functioned nearly as well under the influence of alcohol as is suggested by the film.  When in his cups Poe could barely stagger home or lift a second drink to his lips, let alone competently ride a horse or operate a firearm.

Both Cusack and James McTeigue (the director) have repeatedly commented that ""The Raven"" was never meant to be an accurate depiction of Poe's life but a `dream of Poe', a fantasy that mashes up elements of Poe's life and work.  I can accept that, but feel the film could have been ever so slightly improved by setting this fantasy against a backdrop of reality.  Had they done a little research they would have known that ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" was not printed in Poe's ""Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque"".  They would have known that the doctor who presided over Poe's final hours was named Dr. Moran, not Dr. Morgan.  The filmmakers must have anticipated the scrutiny of Poe fanatics and detractors alike and could have avoided some ill-feeling directed at them by actually researching Poe and featuring real people from his life in the story.

This brings me to one of the most personally disturbing elements of the movie: Why is it that the dramatis personae includes no one other than Poe and my good self (unless you count a passing mention of Longfellow that was almost amusing) that actually existed in reality?  Could not `Henry Maddox' of the `Baltimore Patriot' have been discarded and George Graham used instead?  Why make ""Emily Hamilton"" Poe's love interest instead of Sarah Elmira Royster?  Why omit Poe's cat Catterina in favor of a raccoon named Karl?  Why?

I'll tell you why.  I believe this to be an intentional effort on the part of those who wish me ill to make those unfamiliar with Poe's circle believe that Rufus Griswold is merely another fictional character created for the film, thereby further diminishing my literary influence.  I am not highly regarded by devotees of Poe and this is a deliberate insult, as is casting John Warnaby to portray me on camera.  Seriously, if Brad Pitt had a prior commitment then production on ""The Raven"" should most definitely have been postponed until he was available.  Come on!  At the very least `Rufus Griswold' should have been permitted some dialogue other than screams and pleas for his life.

I am secure enough in my literary and moral superiority to dismiss this Griswold revenge fantasy with but a simple thought for those so gleefully rejoicing in my cinematic demise.  I trust you are all aware that during the period in which the movie is set I had yet to commit my greatest crime against Poe, that obviously being my libelous memoir of the depraved author (seemingly the prime source of biographical information for this script); and in the apparently parallel universe in which ""The Raven"" takes place I will never be able to do so.  In the absence of my making a scandal of his life and character, his works, I truly believe, will never achieve such a level of posthumous fame and the genius Edgar Allan Poe will be just another anonymous inhabitant in my `graveyard of poets'.  What say you now regarding this `dream of Poe'?

The film was not even a little frightening.  The moment that scared me the most was when Ivan ""Reynolds"" (a lame attempt at solving the Reynolds mystery to be sure) announced that he was planning a jaunt to Paris to become a murderous fan-boy of Jules Verne, opening the door to a possible sequel.  Fortunately, this is not to be and I've lost no sleep to nightmares of ""Journey to the Center of Jules Verne"".

The Raven is so excruciatingly dull (even the unremarkable and somnolent score perfectly complements the monotonous action of the film) that it will put people off of the works of the wretch Edgar Allan Poe for years to come, and its inevitable failure at the box office will make Hollywood bigwigs think twice before they green light another Poe related movie.  I suppose the thrifty and uninspired hacks in the motion picture industry will have to pluck ideas from another deceased writer whose work is now relegated to the public domain and then execute those ideas poorly.  Alternatively, if any future aspirant for cinematic achievement should attempt an adaptation in honor of a literary life or work (or both), as doubtless there shall be, I would recommend to him a course governed by familiarity and respect for both the author and his craft.

4865615,2,B005S9EJGO,"The Raven (James McTeigue, 2012)

I had a review of The Raven written a couple of weeks after I watched it. Most of one, anyway; by the time a couple of weeks had passed, I'd forgotten enough that I knew I needed to go back and re-watch a few scenes in order to make sure I had certain facts straight. But the fact that after such a short time I had forgotten so much about the movie was telling, and informed that review. Then my computer ate it. And so here I am starting it again, months later, after I have rewatched those scenes in order to fill in the blanks. Now I have the opposite problem; I've forgotten most of that initial review. But I can guarantee you that the new one will be equally informed by how much I had forgotten about The Raven so quickly after watching it.

Plot: a serial killer in pre-Civil War-era Baltimore is patterning his crime scenes after the stories of Edgar Allan Poe. The police, of course, seek Poe (Say Anything...'s John Cusack) out and initially consider him as suspect, but a rising star in the department, Detective Fields (Clash of the Titans' Luke Evans), takes a different approach and enlists the mystery writer as a consultant. Which is all well and good until the serial killer sets his sights on Poe and his lady love Emily Hamilton (Star Trek: Into Darkness' Alice Eve).

It's all quite pretty, in the same way as McTeigue's earlier hit V for Vendetta, but also like that movie, the longer we go since I see the movie, the less I remember about it other than how well-shot it is. The mystery angle is entirely generic, save for its historical angle, and there are no twists you won't see coming a mile away. The cast assembled for this movie is quite goodthe woefully underutilized Brendan Gleeson plays the precinct captain, for example, and he was the reason I finally decided to sit down and watch the moviebut none of them, including Cusack and Eve, do anything to make me remember why exactly this cast is so good. If nothing else, losing the review and needing to rewrite it has confirmed my original rating of the film, perhaps even reaffirmed it.

This is a story about murders based on Poe's writing, involving people he knows, affecting his life with a stress we all know the poor writer does not need.  Poe's life was not exactly sunshine and lollipops.  He was a visionary struggling with his place in time.  This movie displays him as such, with all his foibles and flaws.

Can Poe help stop this monster?  Can Poe be trusted?  Will those he loves be sacrificed?  Could this have been the push that threw Poe over the edge in life?

4865661,5,B005S9EJGO,"The Raven, directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) comes a fictional but somewhat accurate portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe, and of the time period when he spent his final days hunting a killer. No one really knows what happened to Poe the days before his death when he was reciting the name ""Reynolds"" over and over before his heart stopped. This movie offers one theory, and it's a very intriguing one.

John Cusack plays Poe, a drunk who now sees his potential being wasted by the masses and a newspaper publisher, where some of his short stories get published. But when murders begin to happen as depicted in Poe's stories, a detective named Fields arrives to address the situation, and work with Poe to find the murderer.

The Raven is, honestly, one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It doesn't rely on heavy visual effects, but still makes very good use of some CG (a shootout in the forest, and some nasty gore). McTeigue's directing is superb, I would even say slightly better than V for Vendetta (definitely more-so than his actionfest, Ninja Assassin). Cusack was surprisingly great as Poe, who was not necessarily the action-thriller hero you would expect, with the hero being Luke Evan's Fields, more-so. Evans was great, and while his character wasn't given a lot of background, he was still a likable and interesting character. Alice Eve was good as Poe's love interest in the film, who gets entangled in the game when she is kidnapped by the killer, giving Poe incentive to help. The musical score by Lucas Vidal was impressive, offering something that sounded like a haunting mix of Sherlock Holmes (Zimmer's score) and Knowing (Marco Beltrami). The cinematography was very good, being shot in impressive locations like Belgrade and Budapest. The script, while not award-winning, was very memorable and well-written. There were a few cheesy moments of dialogue during conversations between Brendan Gleeson's character and Cusack, but mainly the script was great at building the eerie atmosphere, and following through on a mystery that wasn't predictable.

The Raven is one of the most underrated thrillers of all time, and it really should have done much better at the box office. I just hope this isn't the last time McTeigue does a period-piece thriller, because he would be great to adapt Dan Simmons's novel, Drood.",1383523200,4,2347,4.936708860759493

4865714,3,B005S9EJGO,"I grew up reading many sci-fi, supernatural, and horror stories and Edgar Allan Poe was one of my favorite writers.  His stories were short, colorful and gave me nightmares.  In reality he wasn't appreciated much during his lifetime, became an alcoholic and drug user and squandered his earnings on his addictive vices.

His death is a bit of a mystery as the film tells us up front.  He was found, near death on a park bench.  So director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare take us on a hypothetical journey of his last weeks.  In a role Nicolas Cage must have drooled over, Poe is played by John Cusack who is obviously having fun constantly playing drunk or stoned or both.  He's also obnoxiously in everyone's face most of the time, yet still manages to attract lovely Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve), the daughter of a wealthy retired military officer (Brendan Gleeson).

When a couple grotesque murders take place, Poe is called in for questioning.  It appears the murders are copies of those appearing in Poe's stories.  The first, involving a woman and her young daughter, mimic ""Tales of the Rue Morgue.""  Poe is quickly excluded as a suspect by ace Baltimore Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and is brought in to help solve the case and those that follow.  Now the movie takes on a Holmes-Watson look.

When Emily is kidnapped in front of everybody at a masquerade party, Poe is required to write stories for the newspaper or she will die, buried alive in a pine box.  All of this silliness really stretches credibility but I have to admit I had a hard time figuring out who the culprit was.  The film, shot in Budapest and Belgrade, looks authentic as do the costumes.  A modestly entertaining diversion.",1370649600,,1737,4.74

The plot line was interesting with sufficient suspense to  keep one involved to the end. Other than Cusak, the key supporting parts were well played and the film was not overextended so as to begin to drag.

4865738,3,B005S9EJGO,"THE RAVEN, a horror/thriller film from director James McTeigue (of V FOR VENDETTA fame) stars John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe. In THE RAVEN, a string of grisly murders takes place, each bringing to reality some of the most famous macabre tales of Poe. Recognizing the connection between the real life killings and Poe's stories, the police bring Poe into the fold in hopes he might be able to offer his insight on the web of mystery and murder which surrounds them.

When I first caught wind of it, the entire project struck me as a cash-in after the success of the rebooted SHERLOCK HOLMES franchise, starring Robert Downey, Jr. I (as a lifelong fan of Poe's work) nontheless saw the film, if for no other reason than to geek out at the sight of some of my favorite stories visualized on screen. The film as a whole, however, left me underwhelmed. Good points of the film included the cinematography, which made use of an incredibly rich and gorgeous palette of colors and lighting, and the sheer joy of seeing Poe's stories brought to life. As Poe, John Cusack give a solid if unremarkable performance, one which I thought was a little over-the-top early on, but that is more of an issue with the script than with Cusack. THE RAVEN devotes all its energy to the mystery at hand, and largely sweeps under the rug Poe's alcoholism and the tragic chain of beloved women (including Poe's wife) lost to tuberculosis during his lifetime, in favor of transforming Poe into an action hero. In fairness, though the trailer makes perfectly clear that THE RAVEN is not a biopic of Poe, I still kind of wanted one, or at least a bit more emphasis on Poe's personal life. As the saying goes, truth can be stranger than fiction, but in the case of THE RAVEN, the truth would have been infinitely more compelling than what is offered here. After viewing it, THE RAVEN reminded me somewhat of Tim Burton's period horror flick SLEEPY HOLLOW, but much more of Steven Soderbergh's KAFKA, a film which attempted a similar premise, also with middling success.

The film really is something worth renting rather than buying, with the most appeal among the Poe devotees. Even for those who adore the work of Edgar Allan Poe, they will most likely finish the film feeling it was not necessarily bad, but a forgettable, run-of-the-mill effort. And, if he were alive today, what might Poe (also known as the ""Tomahawk Man"" in his time, due to the viciousness of his literary criticism) have felt about this film? I think he might have subjected this film to a fate even more gruesome than some of his stories, at the mercy of his own pen.",1369267200,,2613,4.629310344827586

If you have read Poe you know that all the bad things happen because the slant in all of the stories keep going negative, but we like negative as a race and often we go that way when given a choice.

I have to stop, I'm getting flustered.

Just...Why?",1368921600,,697,4.488188976377953
4865743,3,B005S9EJGO,"a little different take on Poe as a person. John Cusack does well with this, and the flavor of the 19th century surrounding, Poe's morose view of life, and especially the treachery of the newspaper media in the late 1800's is well preserved. Not an outstanding work, though.",1368921600,,274,4.729166666666667

Why?  A salute to the written message? Perhaps.  It is also Bizarre that in a dig at Poe by Ivan Reynolds,the printer's assistant, Jules Verne is mentioned but not Victor Hugo.  Only a Frenchman answered ""nevermore"" to Poe in the bar.  And why is there ""Billy Idol-like"" music at the end?

Now that I have seen it ,I must say it was nothing short of wonderful and the comments made were right on target. The movie, staring John Cusack takes on the role of Edgar Allan Poe who is brought in to help police investegate some gruesome murders based on Poe's writing. It does a great job in capturing the 19th century era and I felt the entire cast, especally Cusack, did a stellar acting job. There has always been a mystery as to what caused Poe's death and this film accurate, or not,throws out one more theory of what causd his demise. The only thing I felt could have been toned down a bit was some of the heavy handed gore, I felt it was unnecessary to get the points across. All in all ,this is a great production and yes, it does have the element of a good mystery. If you are looking for something with a cut above,look no further.",1366588800,,937,4.240223463687151

4865777,4,B005S9EJGO,"I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie in spite of John Cusack's tone-deaf performance.  Clearly, he was out of his depth, did he not realize this was a period piece, everyone else did.  He burst onto the scene loud, brash, and very definitely John Cusack playing dress up.  Very irregular, I could believe everyone else belonged there but for him, a time traveler from this decade: never the embodiment of Poe, more of a ""Poe"" excuse for Poe.
The best part of this undertaking is the look.  It's dark and gloomy, sparsely lit by lantern light: the atmosphere of a festering mind and his nemesis/ biggest fan (shades of Misery).
A documentary this is not, nor is it an adequate biography.  Any pretense otherwise is pure delusion from the minds of its two writers Ben Livingston & Hannah Shakespeare.  (I think you always take a chance when you force a famous individual into the parameters of a tale that has no bearing in reality.)
The best part of this movie is the performances by Luke Evans, Alice Eve, and Brendan Gleeson.

The movie itself seem very dark and twisted as your watching might end being gross out at certain scenes but as for myself true horror does not phase me anymore.  Their is some pretty bloody scenes and killing scenes so prepare yourself before watching it.  It also had some great twist and turns as your trying to guess who the actual killer is.  As you watch the movie it does have an impact on you, but for true fans of Poe you get to see some background info on his life like the mention of being at West Point, and how his wife died and drew him into this endless sadness and feelings of death, sorrow.  I actually own the complete works of Poe short stories and poems in one book.

4865848,4,B005S9EJGO,"I was never a fan of poetry, be it by Edgar Allen Poe, or any other poet.  So I approached this movie with some hesitation; seeing that it was built around a fictional account of the poet's life and death, and some of his poems.  Luckily, I was impressed.  This film clocks in at just under 2 hours, but manages to compress an action flick, a drama, a mystery thriller, and a romance all into it.  The action scenes are few but believable and well built.  The romance part of the film centers on the secret love between Poe and the daughter of a local aristocrat.  The girl's father on the other hand, does not like Poe, and the conflict between them provides the drama.  She is kidnapped, one in a series of victims of Poe's deadliest and most avid fan, and this provides the suspense and mystery.  The acting is good, along with the dialogue, costume, set designs and cinematography.  The only think lacking was the soundtrack, which was bland.  Also, there was a bit too much gore, which did not serve to further the story in any way.  Overall, another good outing for John Cusack with strong supporting work from the other cast members.",1362873600,,1140,4.485436893203883

Cusack warmed up after a bit, but in the beginning was a bit off.  Really a pity.  I say wait until it's on television.  :(",1362787200,,434,4.631578947368421

4865874,4,B005S9EJGO,"I got a chance to watch ""The Raven"" (2012) out of the blue but mostly because I liked John Cusack as an actor (he embodies the Poe character). This film is set in the mid-nineteenth century Baltimore, Maryland, and it appeared to be a fictional account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe's life. But, the writers of this film seemed to have based the film on few accounts of the real situations surrounding Poe's mysterious death. Prior to that time, Poe was enlisted to help the local law enforcement with the recent deaths and they discovered that the crimes resembled a fictional murder in one of Poe's short stories.

After watching this film, I found it quite entertaining and interesting story. I've always have a thing for mysteries and histories, so this film was fun to watch.

Read a book about 10 years ago entitled 'Nevermore'.  Brilliantly written by true crime author, Harold Schecter, he craftily manages two characters, Davy Crocket and Edgar Allen Poe as they try to solve a number of grisly murders.  The murders are similar to those committed in 'The Raven'.  Where 'Nevermore' is extremely well done and the odd couple compliment each other in 1834 Baltimore, 'The Raven' is disjointed, and uneven.  Furthermore, the acting is horrible. The idea for the film is clever and could have been compelling, as was the case in 'Nevermore'.  'The Raven' is a complete flop.",1361318400,,726,4.714285714285714

This story,like Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter,takes a real premise,background,and/or character and gives a well thought out,but false story,as to the reasoning behind these aspects. With L:VH it was the fact that the real ex president had a heretofore hidden life hunting vampires. A very good film too(see my review on that).In the Raven the central premise is the fact of Edgar Allan Poe's suspicious death in 1849 in Baltimore. The writers have come up with an explanation leading up to that fateful day. And I must say it is a fascinating story to be sure.
The story finds us in the mid-19th century in Baltimore as we are introduced to a punctilious and condescending Edgar A.Poe. He is in love with a rich Captains daughter,but is at the same time very broke. He is trying his darnedest to get the Baltimore paper he publishes for to print his reviews and,more importantly,obtain a drink from his local;and having no luck with either. Amidst this the police seem to have their collective hands full. Someone is committing some gruesome murders and the two the police have investigated,one right after the other,are both based on two of Poe's stories.
The police come knocking on Poe's door,tell him what is going on and enlist his help to find the killer. A clue left after the last murder indicates the killer will strike at a ball the Captain is giving in his home. The police fully infiltrate the proceedings in order to apprehend the culprit. Suddenly a man on a horse wearing a mask enters the ball room and the police shoot him. He was just a distraction as the killer aways with the Captain's daughter and Poe's fiance'.Now they not only have to find the killer,but save the life of the captain's daughter before it is too late. Through her eyes we find she is in a coffin put under the dirt floor of a room.
Each subsequent murder has a clue and the next leads them to a stage play of Macbeth where Poe actually catches a glimpse of the killer,but he escapes. Later Poe is chagrined to learn the killer has burned his house to the ground and Poe temporarily moves in with the police inspector on the case. The next clue leads them to the city underground sewer system. There they find the body of a missing stage hand from the theater,dressed to resemble the Captains missing daughter. Again the killer just manages to elude the authorities. With a clue found on their recent discovery they head to a church where one policemen is killed and the inspector is wounded. Poe rides off in pursuit but cannot get the killer.
All along Poe has been publishing a new story to coincide with each murder discovery in the police's investigation. That morning a note and a newspaper arrive a Poe's home. The paper is wet whereas the note is dry. Poe deduces the note was written before the paper was delivered and therefore by someone who had access to the story before it was published. Poe rushes down to his paper editor's office to confront him. Meanwhile the ailing police inspector has found a clue and is hurriedly trying to get dressed and rush to find Poe. Poe enters the publishers office only to find him dead at his desk. The only other man there is the typesetter. The two have an interesting discussion. The typesetter gives Poe a slow acting poison to take in exchange for the whereabouts of his beloved. The typesetter gives Poe a verbal clue as he leaves but not a direct answer. Poe suddenly figures it out and is able to find a trapped door underneath the desk they sat at and he eventually finds and saves his future wife. The authorities and an ambulance arrive to take the Captains daughter away but Poe is nowhere to be found.
On a park bench Poe is siting in a daze and awaiting his inevitable fate. A stranger comes up to him inquiring about his health and offering assistance. Poe is able to tell the man the typesetters name. Poe dies and and the stranger passes what he heard Poe say onto the inspector. Fast forward and the typesetter has arrived where he told Poe he would be going;in Paris. Getting into a carriage he meets the inspector. A gun fires...fade to black.
We have all seen films in the past that concern serial killers,even ones such as this who follow fictitious stories with which to commit murders. But because this one has just enough of an interesting twist and is based on a true historical figure,it gives it a nice edge and one up. John Cusack I thought did an excellent job as the melancholy and conflicted Edgar A.The writers here include an explanation as to Poe's melancholia, and they also have a police department/inspector who is not portrayed as a complete moron. This one actually has good police skills and neither Poe or the inspector could have gotten as far as they did without the other. The entire cast does a wonderful job and the sets/costumes are relatively good recreations of a mid 19th century Baltimore.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.the only extra is a commentary track.
To be truthful I must say I am not usually into murder mysteries as such,but once in a while a good enough one comes along to surprise me,and this is one. Well acted,kudos to Cusack,and a nice driving plot,this film comes well recommended.",1360540800,,5502,4.696687370600414

The story in The Raven was great. I like the concept, the settings, and the atmosphere it creates. It really works well as a mystery/thriller, with several clues and action sequences throughout- this is also complimented by its fairly fast pace. The ending of the film was also great, although a scene or two make the killer's identity a bit too obvious. The special effects were great most of the time, especially during the aftermath/investigations. However, the film does use computer-generated blood during scenes with excessive amounts, and I do not like this; I felt like it was out of place and hurt the immersion of the film. The acting was great most of the time, I actually liked John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe, but there was a performance, or two, I didn't like. The music was good (the credits song felt out of place, though), and I enjoyed the dark cinematography.

Overall, The Raven was a surprisingly good mystery/thriller, definitely a film worth watching if you're interested in the genre or have an afternoon to kill. A purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise. As of 2/10/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

4865947,2,B005S9EJGO,"Although this film starts out like a biography of the life of Edgar Allen Poe, it soon becomes a Sherlock Holmes-esque thriller. The producers must not have realized that a film based solely on the life of Edgar Allen Poe would be interesting enough. Too bad they didn't make THAT film!",1359849600,,286,4.627450980392157
4865948,4,B005S9EJGO,"The Baltimore police must enlist the help of Edgar Allan Poe when a deranged madman begins staging a series of gruesome murders around the writer's most famous works in THE RAVEN! John Cusack stars as the ill-fated author, although he often lacks the strength and conviction to carry the film. This rendition of Poe seems less tortured and more focused on melodramatics and snappy retorts, though none will accuse the film of attempting to be an accurate portrayal of the man, himself. James McTeigue paints a stylish thriller that resembles the likes of FROM HELL or SLEEPY HOLLOW in its dark Gothic allure. Poe aficionados will appreciate the delicate interlacing of clues that tie several of the author's most famed stories together while piecing together the killer's grand scheme. Where THE RAVEN mainly falters is in creating any real suspense to lock us in our seats as the murders unfold. As Hollywood thrillers go, however, the somber mood and ever-widening mystery will be enough to win over most mainstream audiences.

4866001,3,B005S9EJGO,"This is not a story about Edgar Allan Poe, nor is it a story about Poe's most famous creation, ""The Raven."" It is entirely fictitious and turns Poe into a sort of modern day detective. It is true that Poe also created the blueprint for all detective stories to follow with his ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" and other stories featuring August Dupin, but the screenwriters here don't make any attempt to illuminate the actual Poe, his relationship with his wife and her mother, his publishers, his contemporaries, or even the circumstances surrounding his death. There are a few lines on the screen that proclaim his mysterious death, but the movie doesn't really explore this. He was found, in someone else's clothing, near death and never recovered. The events that caused his death have never been ascertained, but the most logical guess is he was part of an election vote stealing. He was plied with drink and taken to several polling places (in different clothes) to vote several times. This was a common practice at the time, and Poe, despite popular conception, was not a drunkard. He had an extreme sensitivity to alcohol, almost an allergic reaction. So, giving him too much to drink would essentially kill him.
His life was complex, his personality was difficult to deal with, but his genius was unmistakable. This movie does nothing to advance our knowledge of Poe the person or Poe the artist or even the mystery of Poe's death.
It is heavy on atmostphere and the story itself is rather entertaining, as long as you don't try to place the actual Poe in it. It is a wholly fictional Poe, a completely non historical story, and really more a Poe parody than a story about Poe.",1359072000,2,1682,4.724489795918367

4866003,5,B005S9EJGO,This movie held true not only to Poe's stories but also to his life.  The dramatic story added to this embellished it all excellently with only a minor change to the facts around Poe's death ... yet even this was believeable as the story was told.  Excellent!!  A must see!,1358985600,,273,4.42
4866004,5,B005S9EJGO,For Poe fans The Raven gives a great overview of some of Poe's greatest tales while adding the morality questions that occur when someone creates something that might influence others to do horrible things.  Poe becomes a suspect when someone uses the storylines from his books to murder innocent people.  It becomes personal when the love of his life is taken by the killer and he must race to solve the puzzle before she is gone.  It is a fun and macbre time.,1358985600,,461,4.530120481927711

4866010,3,B005S9EJGO,"The HD quality was really nice and there was some cool looking locations and gothic settings abound that really popped out but the movie itself is not as memorable.

It seemed to me that whoever wrote this, was trying to put a lot characteristics of Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes into Edgar Alan Poe. Cusack's Poe was too jovial for me, too lighthearted for my liking. I enjoyed his quick wit but I never got the sense that there was a dark, disturbing, unsettling true drunkard/genius here. Cusack is going for the hollywood-ish Poe here rather than something that's truly inspired by what we know of Poe. But in this particular case, it was the best route to go, imo. That choice works best here because if Cusack were to go all out and pull, let's say a Jamie Foxx's ""Ray"" or Deniro's ""Raging Bull"" the movie would have been that much more worse only because the written material would not match the actor's ambition.

It is a good rental but I can't imagine anyone taking this home for good save it be that they are extreme Poe fans and erroneously believe that they must fully support this movie to show their loyalty to a great writer...who has actually nothing to do with this movie except that his popular works are referenced here.",1358726400,3,1263,4.608888888888889

Alas.

Here's my real complaint about the film- I felt it relied too heavily on the *wink wink* of Poe references throughout the story and forgot to make the narrative in any way compelling. Cusack plays Poe at volume 11, nearly screaming every line of dialogue he has in the film. I'm guessing that was his way of interpreting Poe's alcohol addiction and macabre persona, but for me it felt overacted and at times a little cartoonish.

Most of the film was forgettable for me, a cheap thrill ride with a lot of atmosphere but no real substance. I don't believe it was the intention of the movie to frighten, but I do believe it was meant to be suspenseful- in any event, on both counts it fell short.",1357084800,4,952,4.459770114942529

4866159,4,B005S9EJGO,"I found this movie interesting and enjoyable. The story is more of a morphed Edgar Allen Poe storyboard with Mr. Poe placed into the action. Its basically a detective story using some of Poe's shorts. It kept my attention throughout and was actually pretty good. I personally do not like when Hollywood destroys great literature but I'll let them slide this time as they didn't truly alter the works. For Hollywood I give them a ""F"". They still come up with nothing new. Stealing old work and twisting it to make a movie is purely lack of imagination. At least it wasn't ""Abraham Lincoln:Vampire hunter""",1356912000,,603,4.752380952380952

He paused every now and then in between a burp and a bite to remind me that this film's folly was to be blinded by the madness of the night where the dull destiny of dreariness consumed every painted pixel of deadly distortion and the illumination of reason was abandoned in a passionless puddle of great proportion. Alas, when the closing credits finally rolled in response to my prayers to the good Lord above who also resides as a gift to the mind deep within, I began to feel my empty skull slowly heal with the rapid exit of this foul-smelling memory of witnessing this sinister cinematic sin. And as I cast my eyes over to the lifeless bones of the black raven who died with his clutching claws desperately targeting the rewind button on the dusty remote, I suddenly discovered a tiny handwritten note which had been tied tightly around his faint and feeble throat. It read as follows: ""To whomever survives this torturous agony of melancholious monotony concealed within less than five evil gigabytes of diabolically conceived insanity, do not forget to warn others of this wicked curse in the hopes they might avoid this treacherous calamity thrust upon the silly stage of Poe-profanity as a small stain trying to soil forever the sweet innocence of divinely evolving humanity.""",1356048000,2,1385,4.823529411764706

4866228,4,B005S9EJGO,"I enjoyed this movie and thought it was very well done.  It was an enjoyable thriller with a fair bit of gore in the beginning.  As in, you actually see a person cut in half - and that's not a spoiler because it happens in the first 10 minutes.

I did find parts of the movie felt anachronistic - mostly the language they chose.  I think it might have been the modern swear words that were thrown in.

The movie itself was a bit dark - and I mean lighting-wise, not thematically.  I found it hard to see what was going on because of the lack of light in some places, but perhaps that was to give more atmosphere to the movie.

John Cusack did a lovely job as Edgar Allen Poe.

It's just overdone and Cusack's typical quick wit/long dialogue works will in dark comedies... but not here...  also I wanted blood and guts! I am a Horror fan - this barely made it.

4866328,2,B005S9EJGO,"I really Like John Cusack, but in this movie, it felt like he was just going through the motions. Maybe he realized, too late, that he had signed on to a bad project, decided to get it over and done with, collect his check and move on to something better.

The theme of murder based on works of literature has been done many times. Murders based on the work of Poe could have been done in a way that felt creepy, insane and could make your skin crawl. Instead we get inspired murders that feel very uninspired and bland. It left me wondering where the eerie factor was and how it could be missed.

Edgar Allen Poe as a crime solver boardering, at times on action hero, is as rediculous as teh idea of one of our presidents as a vampire slayer. Making teh charcater of Poe more like Poe and less like Sherlock Holmes may have helped this movie. Poe was well known as an alcoholic, drug addict, chronically depressed, suicidal and mentally ill. Perhaps that more human character being thrust into a police investigation, where he is forced to face the very real playing out of his imagination, could have made for a better script and given Cusack something to work with.",1355097600,,1168,4.453271028037383

The film is very well executed overall, the editing, music, story, everything is in it's proper place but nevertheless the movie leaves you with a certain dissatisfaction and it's difficult to say why. I would recommend it as what it is: a fine, suspenseful crime story. I always was a big fan of Mr. Poe (he was a true poet and a truly great writer) and an admirer of John Cusack, so seeing him in this role was of course a very exciting thing for me but be advised: If you are not too familiar with the life and death of Edgar Allan Poe and his literary work, this film probably won't make a lot of sense to you..",1355097600,,790,4.308724832214765

4866357,5,B005S9EJGO,"I have been a fan of Edgar Allen Poe's work since I was in Middle School. That was almost 22 years ago. I've read (& own) every poem, short story, & even the 1 novel that Poe has written. His work is that of genius, despite his personal demons of alcoholism & Morphine addiction. ""The Raven"", although a fictional thriller w/ Poe as the main protagonist, is a joy for a Poe fanatic (like myself) to view because there are many factual elements woven into the story. Obviously, the premise of Poe helping the Baltimore PD hunt a serial killer whose homicides are based on the works of Poe is a fictional one. But it is in the way that John Cusak portrays Edgar Allen Poe that peaks my intrest. I've read three biographies on Poe & can say that from the accounts that I've read, Cusak's portrayal is quite accurate. Poe was arrogant, difficult to get along w/, constantly thrown out of pubs & getting into brawls in Baltimore, never tried to hide nor was ashamed of his addictions, always feeling short-changed (which indeed he was), & was, in general, very dishoveled (both physically & personally). I seen 1/2 a dozen actors play Poe & none have tapped into the personality that is described in biographical accounts as well as Cusak!
  As for the film, it's a taut, fast-paced thriller. For fans of Poe, I believe that it will be enjoyed to great extent. Even the fictional premise of the film is incredibly appealing to a Poe fan; a serial killer whose homicides mirror that of Poe's stories, w/ the Baltimore Police requesting the help of Poe himself.
  This film certainly made me dust off my Complete Works Of Poe volumes & re-read some of the greatest literature in both American & World History!",1354492800,,1702,4.5704918032786885
4866398,2,B005S9EJGO,"All we could do was sit there and wish Robert Downey Jr. was playing the lead instead. John Cusack is not good at portraying the emotions and attitudes required, and as a result the character felt wooden and boring. He kept trying to pull off these emotional outbursts that he simply could not make convincing. It was as if someone had left the fourth wall up.

Additionally, the lighting design was terrible. I know they didn't have light bulbs in those days, but The Tudors and any number of Victorian-era productions also worked with that environment and they managed to make the insides look really interesting. The lighting in this movie was just kind of bland and dishwatery.

We sat through the movie because we paid to rent it, but that was the only reason. By the end, I had already fallen asleep twice and none of us could be bothered to care what happened to any of the characters. I will give it two stars rather than one because it wasn't as bad as those stupid vampire movies where everything is blue.",1354492800,,1015,4.540983606557377

Yes, a probable cause of his cause of death is ruminated on with a reference point of an utterance made by the real Poe before his death.

4866401,2,B005S9EJGO,"I almost never write negative reviews. Usually, if I do not like something I simply pass by in silence. I do not like to add to the negativity that already exists in the world. I was really disappointed with this film, however, and I feel compelled to give my honest opinion. There is so much material for a good movie in Poe's life. I love the idea of exploring Poe as a character, the relation between his fiction and his life, or his strange and mysterious death. There is just so much material there, I just do not think this movie really made anything all that interesting out of it. This is essentially your standard serial killer on the loose flick, including the kidnapped loved interest, the hidden clues, and the ticking clock. This story could have been told without referencing Poe at all, and it would have remained essentially the same story.

I have nothing against the premise of this movie. A serial killer is using Poe's stories as inspiration for real murders. A detective recognizes that fact, and brings Poe in on the case. The idea of the film is not really all that original, anyone who watches procedurals on a regular basis will recognize this familiar plot (Castle?), but I was willing to forgive the unoriginality of the premise, because I was looking forward to seeing Poe on screen. I was hoping that Poe's presence would turn a familiar premise into something more interesting. Unfortunately, I do not feel like I got to see Poe on screen. I saw a character who happened to share the same name as Edgar Allan Poe, but I never saw Edgar Allan Poe.

The character in this movie, whose name was Edgar Allan Poe, is a character I have seen in many movies before. The alcoholic writer, the playful trickster, who attempts to woo a girl under the disapproving eyes of her father. This is one of Hollywood's most familiar tropes, and I was really disappointed to see Poe reduced to such a trope. This is a character that I have seen in at least a half a dozen movies before. It just so happens that, in this movie, this familiar character was named Edgar Allan Poe. Poe was a real historical character, and a very interesting character. I do not feel like the writers were really up to the task of portraying such an interesting and complex character. I realize this is a tall order. Anyone who has read Poe will certainly have formed some image of what they think he must have been like as a person. A lot of those images, including, perhaps, my own, are probably not very accurate. It is possible that my disappointment is based simply on the fact that the Poe I saw on screen failed to match the image that I have formed of Poe based on my reading of his stories, and what I have read about him, but let me give some examples of where I felt this movie failed in its depiction of the Poe I imagine, and readers of my review can make up their own mind whether they agree with me or not.

There is a scene where Poe is with the police detective and a number of other police officers at the scene of a crime that is a recreation of Poe's story ""The Pit and the Pendulum"". The police detective says something like ""There is a logic to what this killer does"" and Poe responds by saying something like ""Anyone who could cut someone in half is not operating based on logic"" (with audible moral condemnation in his voice). To me this is such a trite sentiment. This simplistic, moralistic, attitude towards the dark side of human nature, seems totally out of place from the person who wrote ""Imp of the Perverse"", ""The Black Cat"", and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"". Poe spent a great deal of time in his stories dissecting the psychology of killers and the deranged, and his killers were often exceedingly logical people. They were meticulous planners. I just refuse to believe that Poe, with all of his personal experience and insight into the darker side of human nature, would give into such simplistic moralism.

There are so many places where Poe expresses himself in trite formulas, or Hollywoodisms, in this movie. I just cannot stand to hear Hollywoodisms like ""If I could I would dance with you throughout time"" or ""I would gladly give my life for hers"" coming out of the mouth of Edgar Allan Poe. I also do not feel like the film did a very good job portraying Poe's darkness and melancholy. Poe gives a speech, at one point, about a melancholy that has followed him throughout his life, but it is a sign of bad writing when a character has to literally tell you about their melancholy. We should be able to hear it in the way they speak, see it in their actions, and see it on their face. We should not have to be told that Poe is melancholy, we should feel it, without having to be told. The audience does not feel Poe's melancholy in this move. The Poe that I saw on screen was almost entirely devoid of angst. And to make matters worse, he gives into another Hollywoodism by saying that his melancholy followed him all of his life ""until I met Emily"". It is another Hollywoodism to imagine that deep, clinical, depression can be cured by love. The Poe that I imagine would be disgusted by that kind of sentimentality. I realize that Poe wrote love poems, but even those love poems were tinged with melancholy and the awareness of mortality.

I have focused mostly on the portrayal of Poe the character because that is the aspect of the film I was most disappointed with. But what about the story? The story, as I already said, was pretty pedestrian. It is a story I have seen many times before. A serial killer is on the loose, he wants to play games with someone he claims to admire, he kidnaps someone they love to raise the stakes, and the hunt is on. The presence of Poe allows the writers to base each murder on a Poe story, but that is really all that separates this movie from any other serial killer movie or procedural on television. The movie does attempt, in its own way, to solve the mystery of Poe's death, but it leaves so much out of its account, that its ""solution"" is not really that interesting on its own, and feels tacked on. The fact that the writers leave out some of the most interesting mysteries about Poe's death (why was he wearing someone else's clothes?) suggests that providing a fictionalized explanation for Poe's mysterious death was never really their primary intention. If it had been their primary intention, I think they might have made a more interesting movie (think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amadeus-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00006DEFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which was based on the death bed ""confession"" of Antonio Salieri).

Those who are simply looking for a standard serial killer chase film will probably find much to enjoy in this movie, as long as they are not expecting anything too original. Anyone who is coming to this movie out of a love for Poe, and a desire to see him on screen, is likely to be disappointed.",1354406400,,7018,4.628410914927769
4866402,5,B005S9EJGO,The camera work in this movie is amazing. I do not think I have loved a murder scene more that I loved the columnists. It was amazing and reserved at the same time. The coffin camera work was one of my favorite things about this. Hes not your typical run of the mill Poe but it was nice to see some liberties taken. Also I might add for those who know how Mr. Poe was found in his final days this is an interesting take on what could have happened with out having to be 100% historically correct.,1354320000,,496,4.071428571428571

4866404,3,B005S9EJGO,"As would be expected, one has to have some basic familiarity with Poe's life and work to appreciate what this film at least tries to do. I cannot imagine anyone who's never read him having any motivation to watch ""The Raven"" all the way through. On that note, however, Poe fans may also be in for a let-down.

Though one really has to strain to keep disbelief suspended in certain places, the plot is solid enough and makes good use of meaningful clues and details--good for those who like to figure out ""whodunit?"" The acting is competent, and the script avoids being too stereotypically 19th-century. The delivery, though, is flat and rehearsed, and the way EAP himself is presented as such an arrogant and histrionic twit doesn't help matters.

The whole feel of ""The Raven"" is quite contrived, like watching a play that's not quite good enough to make us forget the stage and all its props.",1354320000,,894,4.687898089171974

4866407,5,B005S9EJGO,"The Raven

Bravo!!! The Raven, directed by James McTeigue, drew me in instantly. I love movies that do that! It was well paced and intelligent with beautiful set designs creating a most perfect mood for an intense, deliciously dark experience! A fascinating glimpse straight into the mind and telltale heart of Edgar Allan Poe; if only for an hour or So!

The incomparable John Cusack transforms himself into the hard drinking, hard knocks, pitiful Poe. He bursts onto the scene like a bull in a china shoppe, i mean a tavern, demanding a shot of something! The bartender refuses to serve him since he hasn't paid his tab last! A desperate for a drink Poe replies, ""I'll be flush as a sultan by dawn when The Patriot publishes my review""! Not good enough, the barkeep refuses to serve him! Again Poe lashes out this time at the entire bar in temperamental literary passion fashion!

I immediately lost myself in the sights and sounds of 1849 Baltimore. The clippity clop of gorgeous black beauties pulling carriages down cobblestone streets, 19th. century lanterns lighting up the night, beautiful period costuming i.e. Ladies in bonnets and dresses with long flowing skirts and men in black top hats! What really took my breath away over and over was the magnificent murder of Crows, Ravens, Crows!

Just as in some botched modern day crime scenes, the Baltimore police department appears to be inept when the constable and his men tentatively follow the shrill frantic screams that seem to emanate from a 4th. floor walk up! Eventually, when they arrive too late, they find the bodies of two women butchered, bloody and strangled. Detective Fields, played by Luke Evans, deducing that the gruesome murders strangely resembled those in stories written by Poe. Uh oh!

Poe is cleared of suspicion of murder but soon after becomes embroiled in solving further gut wrenching killings.

Edgar has a burning desire to make the lovely young blond, Emily Hamilton, played by Alice Eve, his betrothed against the wishes of her curmudgeon of a father, Captain Hamilton, played by Brendon Gleeson. Brendon is always an extraordinary treat to watch on screen Imo!

Unfortunately, as time goes by, Poe finds himself in yet another sticky wicket concerning dire life or death for his love Emily, witch only further complicates things!

Rounding out our principals is Kevin McNally who plays no-nonsense PPP, Patriot Paper Publisher Maddux, a constant nemesis of pP, poor Poe.

Though tragic in the end, I found it to be refreshingly clever and satisfying.

On a personal note*, I'd love to see more of John Cusack.

I was very glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie (my wife - who had no expectations going in - was also completely entertained). I found the fictionalized tale spun around Poe's last days to be inventive, engaging, and well developed (albeit, a bit romanticized). I also enjoyed the manner in which scenes from some of Poe's better known stories were worked into the plot. While, as one reviewer put it, this may not be Cusack's best work, he did an excellent job with the primary role. I found myself entralled, to the point of literally being on the edge of my seat toward the end. Lastly, to the reviewer who stated thay they were so uninterested they couldn't make it through the movie I ask, ""What does it take to keep you interested - a 12-volt battery with jumper cables attached to your body parts?""

I am a fan of Edgar Allan Poe's works, and was intrigued when this movie was released.  The story is well done, and entertaining how Poe is entangled within his own stories and characters.  I appreciate books and movies that have the literary characters involved in their own works.  The mystery that plagues Poe (Cusack), in this movie is well done with many clues, but leaves the audience still guessing until the end.  The ambiance of the whole film is dark and mysterious and alludes to many of Poe's stories and life.  Knowing somewhat about Poe's life, if I had anyone playing a person who seems to live just at the cusp of reality, it would be John Cusack.  His performance, not exactly Oscar material, was entertaining and did a great job at recreating the master of the macabre.",1354060800,,929,4.697530864197531

4866423,4,B005S9EJGO,"I always enjoyed reading and re-reading Poe's poems.  He is probably best known for his poems ""The Raven"" and ""Anabel Lee"" but my favorite of his is his poem ""Alone"".  John Kusack plays E. A. Poe in this film.  His dark hair and pale features match imagination we can have of poet who was as talented as he was emotionally troubled.  Poe's personality and character is pretty much formed by the difficult life he had.  Early on in his life, he lost people very close to him which gave him outlook on life and kind of sensitivity very few people can ever have in their lifetime.  Of course, this was by no way ""a gift"".  It made him social outcast that further led to his need to drink in order to dull the emotional pain and loneliness.

I really enjoyed this film if for no other reason that for wonderful quotes from his poems.  Cusack manages to bring intensity of this writer who is a legend amongst literary elite.",1354060800,,919,4.390532544378698
4866424,4,B005S9EJGO,"Being a fan of the works of Edgar Allen Poe, I was naturally interested in the fictional tale of the last days of the iconic horror writer's life. The film stars John Cusack as Poe, a natural choice with his dark features and ability capture dark and neurotic characters. Cusack never disappoints me even if the film itself isn't great, he's just one of those character actors that always delivers a performance.

The story follows Poe as he's suddenly thrown into a sick and twisted game involving a murderer obsessed with Poe's writing, so much to the point he models his brutal killings after Edgar's stories. Things get personal when the killer kidnaps Poe's love Emily (Alice Eve) and forces Poe to take part in his game in order to get her back. Poe works with inspector Fields (Luke Evans) to track down the killer before its too late.

There's something cool about taking historical figures and making them dangerous and exciting heroes. Much like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the film has that kind of fantasy element that brings a special type of enjoyment due to it involving a real person. I think we want to believe that behind the scenes, they really were heroes. This film does a good job of building up Poe as a brilliant yet troubled genius who's a natural detective.

Cusack seems natural as Poe, although his portrayal didn't exactly meet my expectations. When I think of Edgar Allen Poe I always imagine a quiet, modest man that keeps mainly to himself. I could be way off, but that's just how I would picture the man behind such dark and gruesome writings. Cusack's Poe on the other hand is often boisterous and a bit full of himself. This could very well be accurate, but this was one of the few aspects of the film that caught me off guard and made it feel a bit over the top at times.

The film very much reminded me of Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. from the pacing, set and costume designs, to the lead characters both self-aware know-it-alls who mask many of their personal demons. The movie also paints Poe as more of a detective than a writer. Whether or not Poe was ever really involved in murders or other real-life crimes resembling his stories, the film makes me want to believe he was.

I highly enjoyed this film when I saw it in the theater, and upon watching again on Blu-ray, I still do. I love the way the writing is incorporated into the story, and how it manages to be an original story while also tying in many real aspects of Poe's life. Even though bits of the writing seemed to have been trying too hard to make Cusack's Poe speak poetically the majority of the time, the film was very nicely played out and looked great. The story was even a nice mystery that worked well with the source material and made Edgar Allen Poe only seem that much cooler.

""The Raven"" starring John Cusack takes a different approach in that it is a fictionalized account of Poe's (Cusack) last days while on the trail of a demented serial killer.

The story is set in 19th century Baltimore, and the movie is for the most part set in darkness which is apt considering the heinous nature of the murders. A serial killer is murdering innocents all over the city, and Poe initially comes under suspicion as the murders mirror events in his stories. The downtrodden Poe here is portrayed by John Cusack (whom I felt delivered a less than stellar performance, and I happen to be a fan), a writer who is at the end of his rope because his publisher refuses to publish his poems, preferring his gruesome stories and demanding more of the same. Poe is in love with the lovely Emily (Alice Eve), the daughter of a prominent man, Captain Hamilton (portrayed by Brendan Gleeson). Hamilon disapproves of Poe whom he considers to be vile and beneath their social station, but Emily manages to sneak around and see Poe anyway.

The other main character is Inspector Emmett Fields (played by Luke Evans) who realizes that Poe is not his man and decides to bring Poe on to his task force to help them capture the serial killer. The story really takes off after Emily is kidnapped by the killer and the clock starts ticking - Poe and Fields need to piece clues together quickly before Emily suffers a grisly fate at the hands of the killer.

The premise drew me in and I liked how Poe's works were woven into the storyline, serving as the link between Cusack's Poe and the killer. The killer is evidently a fan of Poe's works, but I felt the movie never truly delved into the killer's character. By the time the killer's identity is revealed, I felt a sense of disconnect from what was happening on screen - it is difficult for me to get into a movie where I can't connect or understand the central characters and The Raven, which showed much promise in its premise, failed to deliver in terms of character development and a credible plot.",1353283200,2,2790,5.423963133640553

4866523,4,B005S9EJGO,It is difficult for me NOT to love a movie with John Cusack and The Raven is no exception. A+ casting and a fun story make for an engaging film!,1353024000,,144,3.8333333333333335
4866524,3,B005S9EJGO,"This movie really disappointed me. The premise was wonderful....Edgar Allen Poe joins forces with a young Sherlock Holmes-like detective (well played by Luke Evans)to solve a series of grisly murders in turn-of-the-century Baltimore. Throw in a great cast featuring one of my all-time favorite actors, John Cusack, and you have the perfect recipe for a crime/horror masterpiece. The reality, however, fell way short of ""masterpiece"" and landed solidly in the ""mediocre"" category. I don't regret watching it, but I do not give it my enthusiastic recommendation.

Problems: John Cusack seemed strangely detached and delivered a completely flat, unengaging performance. I never connected with his character and thus never became personally involved in the story. They could have hired a B-Movie hack actor, paid him one-tenth the salary, and probably ended up with a better production. The presence of a great actor not living up to expectations always degrades one's appreciation of a movie, and, quite frankly, his presence was more a distraction than an asset.

The supposed relationship between Poe and Emily (Alice Eve) never seemed the least bit compelling or even believable. He is a drunken, completely self-absorbed, broken down (and just plain broke) hack writer. She is young, rich, and beautiful. I guess such a relationship could possibly exist, but no details are provided to ever make us understand why it does. Their shared dialog and interactions are strictly melodramatic and never give evidence of any sincere love or affection.

The motives of the villain are not clear or credible. Like all poorly-drawn movie villains, he knows everything, appears and disappears as if by magic, and seems to benefit from an absurd confluence of perfect timing and luck. The clues he leaves are ridiculously complex and indecipherable, particularly a location that would require extremely precise measurements to calculate and yet is done so, to absolute perfection, using very vague information.

Bottom line: This movie showed huge promise. Having seen the early previews, I could not wait to see it. When expectations are great, the possibility of disappointment increases, and in this case, the let-down was extreme. I still gave it three stars, because the premise really is wonderful, Luke Evans does a good job, and it does offer some good moments, but, to me, it was nowhere near being as good as it should have been.",1353024000,,2427,5.247422680412371

4866555,2,B005S9EJGO,"The notion of centering a Victorian murder mystery and abduction around the works of the grim writings of Edgar Allen Poe is a terrific invention. It's a shame such an elegant idea wasn't given a better batch of actors to work with.

The critics panned this film upon its release and unfortunately it's not hard to see why. The idea is ingenious but the way it plays out isn't. Everything should work but doesn't... the lovely costumes, the terrific supporting cast (made up of well-known British talent), the thunderous score, and a tight script full of humor and morbidity. It draws upon many of Poe's better and lesser known works but isn't entirely solid on its conclusions; the revelation of the murderer's identity isn't explored enough to make sense of it (why do it?) although the film does get vengeance in the end. It felt like a missed opportunity, in part because the main leads have no workable chemistry together -- neither Fields and Poe, nor Poe and Emily have any energy on screen, and three lackluster performances put together doesn't help the movie reach its conclusion.

Cusack is terrible here; he looks the part but approaches the material without the sense of morbid humor and energy it requires. Eve sounds as if she's memorized her lines, never varying her tone or bringing much likability to Emily. It's a shame, because there are elements in the script that could have been worked with, to flesh out these characters... like Poe's pet raccoon, or the farce he and Emily undertake in front of her gun-toting father. Everyone takes the production much more seriously than they ought, and it's a shame.",1352764800,3,1627,4.827956989247312

The telephone wasn't available to the public until 1891, several decades after Poe died.  My suspension of disbelief failed me.

The best part of the movie is that it is like a game to find all the clues and hints of Edgar Allan Poe's life throughout the movie. It was enjoyable to see several of the story concepts from Poe done as murder mysteries. John Cusack was an amazing Poe.

Just how imagine Poe to have been. The story is intriguing and a cool spin on the unknown final days of the author.

4866647,4,B005S9EJGO,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi

The Raven is a mystery/thriller fictional tale with facts scattered throughout about Edgar Allan Poe.
It's set in 1849 Maryland. Police investigate a series of murders. The crime scenes are straight out of the writings of Poe.
Poe had become addicted to alcohol and drugs after losing his true love, Virginia, to tuberculosis.
In The Raven we find our writer, with a new love Emily Hamilton. He desires her hand in marriage but her father, Captain Hamilton, hates Poe.
Everything comes together when the police and Poe suspect Hamilton to be the next victim. Instead Emily is kidnapped and it soon becomes apparent she's entombed mocking ""the Cask of Amontillado.""
Poe and the police search the tunnels under the city. They discover an area of fresh brickwork, and can see what looks like a woman with blonde hair. They get to the body only to discover it's that of a sailor dressed to appear like Emily. But there is another clue.
The film does reference the theory that Poe was poisoned. I found it entertaining, and quite watchable. Most critics did not. Of course, I've always liked the writing of Edgar Allan and the mystery surrounding the author.
 The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre. The Raven barely brought back its budget at the box office by grossing $26.05 million worldwide on a budget of $26 million.",1352332800,,1469,4.872

Poe was a great writer.,1351900800,,332,4.123076923076923

4866809,3,B005S9EJGO,"The gore and thriller factor in the movie was fitting for a horror-like flick; however, the big disapointment in this movie was the portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe, which just seemed off. He embodied the image of a self-obsessed alcoholic. The other problem: there is only one possible killer introduced early in the film, so within the first 20 minutes or so, you know who is behind the murders. It should have been harder to guess. Some more subplot development would have helped in that arena. But hey, who doesn't like John Cusack? And he did have a pet raccoon, which was one of few endearing qualities of Poe in this film. Again, not amazing, but not terrible. A worthwhile rent if you are a Cusack fan, but not if you are a fan of Poe.",1351814400,,739,4.4411764705882355
4866810,5,B005S9EJGO,"I saw this moving in the theatres when it originally came out and was smitten.  I love the way Cusack channels Poe with the arrogant entitlement mixed with extremely witty repartee, including insults where the insultees barely realize they've been insulted.  I love the complex sentence structure in the movie, unlike the cutesy one-liners so popular in films these days, and the poetic literacy Cusack nails in the film.  Unlike what SOME reviewers (not naming any names, but the one that comes to mind is a famous half of a once very famous movie critiquing team) have commented, nowhere in this film does it state or imply that the scenario posited for Poe's demise was an actual attempt to explain how he died.  This is a work of FICTION, and the scenario used to depict the way Poe COULD have died is just that: a possibility that happens to work very well for the story.  The way the writers intertwine Poe's writings with an all-new murder mystery is ingenious.",1351728000,,968,4.704142011834319

Seemed more like a PG-13 movie than an R,except for the gory first killing, but that's what I expected. The scene wasn't any worse than watching the TV shows, ""CSI"" or ""Bones."" After all, it was based on Poe's grissly stories. The killer was a complete surprise, and of course we met early on in the film, it just didn't register as a possibility. I was glued to screen all the way through. An excellent thriller/mystery, with logical connections to Poe's stories.

4866837,2,B005S9EJGO,"What if someone reads Edgar Allan Poe stories, and imitates his dark tales in real life? And what if it is Poe himself who has to track down the murderer? Set in Baltimore, 1849, ""The Raven"" starts out with this unique idea, but soon the film squanders its great potential by failing to provide a main story that can hold the viewer's attention to the end. In short, ""The Raven,"" directed by James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta""), has numerous references to the life and works of Poe, but neither Poe's character nor his story is interesting in ""The Raven.""

Intense John Cusack plays Edgar Allan Poe, a perpetually drunk, penniless writer, who wants to have his review published. But the newspaper editor Maddux (Kevin McNally) doesn't want one; Maddux wants something lurid and sensational, something like ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" Poe once wrote.

In the meanwhile, Inspector Fields (Luke Evans) investigates a brutal murder case, which, the intelligent police detective discovers, resembles one story Edgar Allan Poe wrote. The inspector and the writer then join forces to solve the case, but the killer keeps one step ahead of them.

Atmospheric as it is, ""The Raven"" is not mysterious as it should be, with its plodding pace and by-the-numbers storytelling that dilute what little thrill there is to be had. Alice Eve is wasted as Poe's romantic interest Emily, and so is Brendan Gleeson as Emily's strict father. To make matters worse, some contraptions that are inspired by Poe's original works look familiar to us now.

Of course, Poe is the original, an eccentric genius who created ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue."" It is not that ""The Raven"" is terrible. It is just that the film doesn't have a storyline that is as engrossing and gripping as Poe's macabre tales from which it draws inspiration.",1351555200,,1829,4.890322580645162

4866842,2,B005S9EJGO,"In the year 1849, Edgar Allan Poe vanished for a week. He was later found on the streets of Baltimore, deathly ill and delirious. What happened and why he died is still a subject for debate.

So ""The Raven"" tries to combine that mystery with another kind -- the serial-killer type. It's not a bad concept, and they obviously crafted the death scenes and grimy, murky Baltimore setting with care. But the pacing is as heavy as a wet sandbag, and the mystery is amateurishly cobbled together.

In 19th-century Baltimore, two women are brutally murdered -- one's head is nearly severed, and the other is stuffed up a chimney. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes the crime from ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" a story by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe himself (John Cusack) is a penniless erratic mess, but Fields calls him in to help with the investigation.

And in the next few days, more bodies stack up -- each one killed in a way reminiscent of a Poe story or poem. Even worse, Poe's girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped during a masquerade ball, and the killer sends them taunting clues about where she is being held. Now Poe must race against time -- and even risk his own life -- to save her. Blech.

I wanted to like ""The Raven."" I really, really did. And at first, it seems like a promising movie: Luke Evans is wonderfully intense, and 19th-century Baltimore is beautifully bleak, murky and foggy. And the opening scene is beautifully surreal, with Poe collapsed on a park bench as a raven spirals into the cloudy sky.

Unfortunately, the plot itself is a mess. For one thing, the pacing is completely leaden. It just sort of lurches from one gory murder to the next, not really building any suspense. The closest thing we have to suspense is ""Will they save Emily?"", and frankly I didn't care if they did.

And the mystery is really poorly written. There are no clues to the killer's identity until the final act. It feels like the filmmakers belatedly realized, ""Hey! The movie's almost over, and we don't have a villain! Not even any clues! Quick, choose somebody random!"" And yes, the murderer's identify will be a genuine surprise... because you won't have the faintest idea who this person is.

And the character of Emily really bothered me. When he died, Poe was engaged to a beautiful widow, who was also his first childhood love. And she would have worked fine as a damsel in distress... but NOOOOOOO, they had to shoehorn in a dim blonde bimbo half his age. It feels fake and shallow.

As for the acting... it's tolerable. Cusack does the dissipated, depressed Poe well, but his more energetic scenes seem horribly forced. Eve is as annoying as a fly you can't get rid of. Luke Evans turns in the finest performance as a sharp, steely-eyed young police detective, and the intensity of his acting never even wavers.

""The Raven"" had some good ideas and marvelous set work, but the plot lurches and thumps like a drunken raven -- and the mystery is less than satisfying.",1351555200,5,2993,4.642722117202268

It wants to be From Hell, but I recommend that movie instead because it's just 100 times better.  In that film you come to care for the characters and see them as more than just hookers or addicts, plus the suspense and terror is satisfyingly good and doesn't weigh down a well-written story.

Here we have John Cusack playing Edgar Allen Poe in an overly Nicholas cage reaching way that's downright cloying.  The worst part of it is that Poe wasn't a ranting, raving lunatic spouting off poetic verbiage in the middle of the rest of cast using language from our time.  About the only things that were accurate in this awful movie were the facts that he was penniless and a drunk.  As someone else here stated, why must we put real historical figures in ridiculous situations that transform them into Han Solo action figures.  Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter?  Poe as a criminal investigator?  What's next, are they going to put Mark Twain in a cape and have him fly around the Mississippi in search of killers?

That's not even the worst of it.  ""Serial Killer"" is splashed on the front page of the paper, and I thought it was hilarious.  That term wasn't USED back then.  We also get the pleasure of witnessing fake blood flying around as a swinging hatchet slices a writer in half.  Talk about your hatchet jobs.  Then there is the problem with having to see Poe is madly in love with, not Virginia, but Bugs Bunny in a dress (Alice Eve) who is very pretty but has yet to prove she is worthy of the term ""actress.""  I haven't seen her in one good movie yet.  Come to think of it, Cusack hasn't been batting a thousand with his role choices lately either, and this is no exception.  We also have the most disappointing killer in the world by the time this 150 minute mess that feels like its 150 hours rolls to a close.  Best of all, when the closing credits roll, there is some oddly mismatched music that doesn't fit the movie at all.  Then again, virtually everything about this fiasco is out of place.

Yes, alas, poe Edgar.  Your name has been used to further somebody else's career and financial status.  I would rather watch Vincent Price movies that stick to EAP's stories than ever watch this schlock again.  The experience was almost as pleasant as having your teeth pulled out one at a time with a doorknob and string.  I miss the younger John Cusack.  Where did he go?

Such is the case for ""The Raven,"" a horribly inept attempt to tell the story of author Edgar Allen Poe.  John Cusack was absolutely awful in this dud of a ""chiller.""  Miscast doesn't do him service.  I'm sure it wasn't the director's attempt to try and give a historical by-the-book recreation of the life of Poe.  I know that he was way before his time when it came to introducing the element of horror into his stories, poems, etc., and he died penniless and an alocholic.  Believe me, had the writers at least tried to go there, they might have made something interesting.

Instead, you get a cheap rip-off of Robert Downey and Sherlock Holmes.  It seems some meanie is killing associations of Poe via his stories, e.g. ""The Pit and the Pendleum,"" ""The Prematue Burial,"" ""The Cask of Amantillado,"" and ""Murders in the Rue Morgue.""  Even with that, the story is just a snoozefest.  You wind up with more unanswered questions than answered ones:  why was the girl interested in the least with Poe?  Why did her father hate him so?  Why did I watch this movie?  On top of that, you're given characters that you couldn't possibly care about.

The movie was directed by James McTeigue and is rated R for some gore.  I hope John Cusack hasn't sunk so low that he now has to take roles that he just isn't suited for.  I have thought for a long time that he was one of Hollywood's most underrated actors.  After seeing this debacle, I'm beginning to think it was me who overrated him!",1350864000,2,1612,4.481099656357388
4866885,4,B005S9EJGO,"This is one of John Cusack's better performance.  Almost as good as his portrayal of John Berendt in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Here, Cusack plays the renowned Edgar Allen Poe.

Please remember that this is not a biography.  These are not actual events based on the life of Edgar Allen Poe.  The plot is heavily influenced by his works, but Poe himself did not write this story.  Nor did he live through the events depicted in the movie.

The time is 19th century Baltimore, Poe's time.  A brutal serial killer is on a rampage, killing his victims in gruesome ways.  Ways that mimic events from Edgar Allen Poe's short stories.  The victims are killed in such a manner as to parallel those in the stories.  At this time, Poe is a struggling writer.  Although highly admired for his imaginative talents, he is not financially well-rewarded.  He writes for the city newspaper, entertaining the readership with his short stories.  The killer is evidently an admirer and challenged the Baltimore police to solve the puzzle.  The chief detective on the case, Emmett Fields, enlists the help of the writer.  The two men work together to solve the mystery as the body count starts to rise.

This is another one of the year's good movies.  As I said, John Cusack was good in the role.  Luke Evans is equally good as the Baltimore detective, Emmett Fields.  I also liked the ever-present ravens in the movie.  Even Poe's all black suit and black cloak remind one of a raven.  His long, dark hair and dark facial hair also are symbolic of a raven.  With his billowing dark cloak, you almost expect him to fly.  This movie has a very dark tone.  There is not one scene of a shiny, cheerful day.  Most of the day scenes are shrouded in thick fog.  There is a atmosphere of menace in just about every scene.

This is not even close to a biography of Poe.  But I see this movie as still having value.  Hopefully, this movie will ignite people's curiosity about Edgar Allen Poe.  I can see a lot of people browsing the internet to read ""The Raven"" right after watching the movie.  And for those literary types, this one just might make you dust off your copies of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"", and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"".  If there is an after-life and Poe could watch this movie, he would be very amused and quite delighted with Cusack's portrayal.",1350864000,,2373,4.54739336492891
4866896,4,B005S9EJGO,"The police come as the neighbors have called them because a woman is screaming.  As they stand outside of the room they hear the door key click and the door is locked.  They break the door down and they find a dead woman and then they find a second young child stuffed in the chimney. Someone locked the door but they found no murderer and no way to get out of the room as the only window is nailed shut.

The murder seems familiar as suddenly they remember that it is similar to a story by the famous Edgar Alan Poe.  They track Poe down and find out that he has an alibi and couldn't have done the murders.  A few days later a man is murdered in the same style as the famous Pit and the Pendulum story.  Even stranger is that the dead man and Poe had knowledge of each other and it was not a good one as the dead man was a literary critic of Poe's writing.

The detective on the case believes Poe is innocent but the question is who and why do they have a serial killer on the loose who is emulating Poe's macabre stories and using them as a modus operandi for the murders....

This is an excellent and suspenseful mystery story about the suspicious circumstances that surround the death of Edgar Alan Poe.  John Cusack plays Edgar Alan Poe and he does a wonderful job of portraying the character.  It is interesting fictional story about the possibilities that may have occurred around Poe's life and mysterious death.

Unfortunately the movie starts slowly and in addition so much of the beginning is filmed in dark rooms and dark scenes that turn so many people off about movies.  The pace picks up and the story gets more intense as it goes along.  My wife and I are glad we stuck with watching the film as it got better and better.

4866897,3,B005S9EJGO,"Hi,

I watched the movie on amazon instant video... thingy in HD. Quality was good, no streaming issues. Initially, it paused during the producing company's logos but the movie itself played smoothly.

After watching the trailer this presented itself as a Sherlock Holmes-style thriller. Overall, the movie is well-done. If you like Cusack (the reason why this was a must to watch for me) then this fits right into other performances and patterns of his movies. The costumes were appropriate as were the settings/scenery.

Now, the plot felt a bit shallow and I would have walked away and come back to it had I not paid $4.99 for the rental (the famous ""Box"" does not have the Bluray just yet). I did like the ending/last few minutes and thought that they were creative. Would I watch it again? Most likely not. And, I would not by the DVD/Bluray on sale either.

However, if you like Cusack and are a big fan, you should -- without question -- watch this movie. He does well with the gloomy/depressed intellectual with that forever shimmer of hope inside of him. I think the movie reminded me of  blend of V for Vendetta, Sherlock Holmes, and The Legends of Sleepy Hollow; Holmes being the least similar.",1350777600,2,1205,4.691943127962086
4866898,3,B005S9EJGO,"Sometimes the performance is the thing and in the case of ""The Raven"" John Cusack gives a frenzied, memorable performance as Edgar Allen Poe. Some reviews here have confused the man with the character created for this film so let's be clear--this is a fictionalized account around Poe's last days and nicely captures the feel for the era.

SPOILERS:

Detective Emmert Fields (Luke Evans) puts pressure on Poe to help him find a killer that uses the author's stories as a template for his actions. Soon it becomes clear to Fields and Poe that the killer wants the author engaged in the pursuit as he kills one of Poe's critics in a particularly gruesome fashion patterned on ""The Pit and The Pendulum"". The duo race to discover the killer as he leaves a grisly trail of bodies in his wake. Poe's personal life appears to be in shambles as well as he is literally on his last dime waiting for a new review to be published. He also faces resistance from his love Emily's (Alice Eve) father (Brendan Gleeson)as he attempts to court her.

James McTiegue (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-for-Vendetta-Blu-ray/dp/B000PC0U1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V for Vendetta [Blu-ray</a>] does a nice job of setting up the action sequences and creating an earth atmosphere nicely capturing the era. He also gets the most out of his performers even when their roles are underdeveloped; the character of Alice is sketched in and while her father played by Gleeson has nice presence most of that is due to the actor NOT due to the development of his character. Moving the action along can be done well with good character development and it seems to me that quite a bit was sacrificed in moving this script to the screen. The deleted scenes might have added some additional character development but there still seems to be more that might have been sacrificed to make this a smooth, sleek superficial thriller.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray for ""The Raven"" looks quite nice--the format lends itself well to dark looking movies like this. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout and retains the film-like quality of the movie.

Audio is likewise impressive with an immersive 5.1 lossless presentation with nice depth and detail present throughout but with dialogue clear even in the action sequences.

We get subtitles in English and Spanish as well.

The special features are a mixed bag. We get an interesting sometimes all too clinical audio commentary from director McTeigue and the producers. Still we do get some interesting facts about the production, Poe's mysterious death and some fact vs. fiction moments present throughout the film.

We also get a number of featurettes including a brief overview of Poe's life and the circumstances surroudning his death that includes clips from the film focusing on where the fact for this fiction was derived from.

""The Raven's Guts"" is largely a superficial behind-the-scenes featurette while ""The Raven Presents John Cusack and James McTiegue"" sees actor and director face off as they discuss what attracted them to the film.

""The Raven"" offered quite a bit of potential some of it unrealized; while Cusack will hold your attention in his performance as Poe and he gets able, strong support from a variety of character actors, the film could have been better with more character and plot development.

As a fictionalized examination of a serial killer (a term used in the film which wasn't invented until the 1960's)using Poe's work as inspiration and Poe as a crime solving writer, ""The Raven"" manages to be an interesting and entertaining film that could have been much, much more.",1350777600,,3655,5.073333333333333

Sure, he is distraught with the capture of his lady love, but it would have been nice to see him really use his twisted creativeness in noticing little details and discovering who the baddie was. The  movie as a whole just seemed way to rushed... too much could have been done if only the movie had been longer... or if it had been a several episode production by the BBC for PBS.

It was slighty fun to see him argue in a bar.  I really like all of the trivia and literary allusion.  But it just was stupid and it dragged on.  I honestly don't remember how it ended.  It wasn't very well made.  And Poe as the red hot lover of the blonde actress with the constantly heaving breasts was pretty unbelievable and kind of gross.

Cusack's dialogue and delivery seem like they sort of come from a completely different movie.  Like he nailed the era's speech and mannerisms pretty well while the rest of the cast spends a lot of time whipping off too-contemporary dialogue and terms that didn't even exist during the time period (like ""serial killer"").  However, as a work of fun tribute to one of America's most interesting literary figures, it was absolutely entertaining.  The thriller angle was fun while allowing us glimpses into some of Poe's most notable works.  I've always been a fan of Poe (and John Cusack, for that matter), so I may be a little biased.  If you're looking for a movie that is as literary as Poe's work, you can forget The Raven.

The script also conjures its own take on Poe's mysterious death.
The underappreciated John Cusack does a splendid job in balancing the caricature of Poe with his own character interpretation.  He gives us what we would expect in Poe with a sense of who he might have been.  Luke Evans does well as Detective Fields. Alice Eve is lovely as Poe's lady in waiting and Brendan Gleeson is appropriately loutish as Emily's father.  The movie captures its 1849 Baltimore effectively and the murders are fiendishly staged, especially the pendulum scene.

When I read about John Cusack portraying Edgar Allan Poe, I wasn't sure that he would be able to pull it off, don't get me wrong, Cusack is a decent actor but Poe is special, at least he is to me, so I wasn't sure he could rise to the challenge.  I'm happy to report that he did a good job in this movie, I enjoyed it very much.
The story was interesting and exciting that held my attention until the very end.  I kept thinking that this story fits nicely with what little we know about the last mysterious days of Poe's life.
I also liked hearing the little bits and pieces of Poe's actual works that were peppered throughout the story especially ""Annabel Lee"" which is one of my favorites (and that of lots of my students!)

Surprisingly, this is much better than many of the reviews have suggested - and definitely an improvement on the Holmes or Lincoln movies.

John Cusack is a good casting choice as Poe and pretty much everyone else hits the right notes too. The music is overpowering but the production design and Budapest backdrop give it a distinct and disturbing look that would suit one of his stories. As Poe is generally considered one of the pioneers of detective fiction, it's fitting that this historical mash-up is told in the form of a detective story and for the most part it keeps the audience guessing effectively.

There's enough blending of known parts of Poe's character and artistic license for the whole idea to work. Although this is from the same director as V For Vendetta, don't expect anything too similar - it's not as polished as V but still an interesting film all by itself. There's enough to keep literary fans watching and also engage people who've never heard of the man.",1350172800,4,1243,4.803738317757009
4866914,5,B005S9EJGO,"Like the five stars say: I LOVE IT!

This is a great movie that will keep you on your toes all the way to the end. The movie is a fictional representation of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe. For people who know how he died his last minutes are not a surprise. What is surprising is the plot that gets us there. Although I know and read about Edgar Allan Poe's life and sudden death at the young age of 41, the plot took me by surprise. And for a moment, just a moment, I thought that the movie will have a sequel dealing with Jules Verne's death (who died peacefully in France, at home, from complication of diabetes).

The plot is somehow complicated: somebody is murdering people in a brutal manner throughout Baltimore. All gruesome murders follow to the letter the murders described by Poe in one of his books. At the beginning he is a suspect, but it becomes clear soon that someone is copying his books. The mysterious murderer takes his girlfriend hostage, in order to make him write another set of stories that the newspaper must print on the front page every day. While the mystery murderer leaves clues all over the dead bodies, Poe and the police are racing to find his girlfriend because they are told she is in imminent danger. The very end of the movie (...last 20 seconds) are really unexpected and make you jump out of your seat. Once you saw the end, check Poe's last words in real life...The plot may make sense after all!

This is a great suspense/thriller movie that is worth the money. A question (that may be a spoiler) for everybody is: why a human hair is attracted to a magnet? Or, why a dollar bill is attracted to a magnet?

I was never a fan of John Cusak's acting performances, but this is the first time (as far as I am concerned) that his acting really surprised me and he appeared like a great actor. Not De Niro or Pacino yet, but on his way to this level. In spite of Cusak's name of the cover, I purchased the blu ray because I am fan of Edgar Allan Poe. I did not regret it!

Five stars all around for the great plot, the acting, the direction, and of course the gruesome special effects.",1350086400,,2125,4.3025
4866915,4,B005S9EJGO,"When I was a kid, my favorite writer was Edgar Allen Poe.  As a matter of fact, I still think that he was the best writer ever; yeah, even better than ""that"" guy.  (I can hear names thrown about such as Mark Twain and Shakespeare.  Mr. Poe's writing is still readable today, even though I was a fan of Mr. Twain's when I was a kid as well.)  And I've been a big fan of John Cusack's as well.  The movie ""High Fidelity"" is one of my favorites of the genre, and I really like Mr. Cusack's style, skill, and likability overall.

So, it makes sense that I liked ""The Raven"" as a movie, where many of the critics appeared to have not.  I don't know exactly why they don't like it yet; I tend to avoid reading reviews before watching any film because it taints the experience for me.  But ""Raven"" reminds me of ""The Da Vinci"" code if that movie were watchable, not to dis on Tom Hanks.  It was just too conspiracy-theory for my tastes, where Raven takes history, adds a little bit of conjecture (hey, the writer of the screenplay for sure knew it was highly unlikely himself) and make it just plain more fun.

The one thing that this film did make me do:  do some research about Mr. Poe's life.  I read a little bit last night after viewing, read about some things that I didn't know before.  Many of the true pieces of his life are in this film and so that adds to the fun.  While I have read a majority of Mr. Poe's work, I do wish that I would have known some of these personal things before watching; now that would be a recommendation to you.

Other that those minor factoids, did any of this stuff really happen in real life?  Probably not.  But I still give this movie a recommendation for a viewing.  After all, I was entertained and this film was entertaining.  And sometimes, that's all that matters.",1350086400,2,1804,4.252941176470588

4866949,4,B005S9EJGO,"For many viewers this film seems to have been expected to be a biography of Edgar Allan Poe's life and it is obviously not that. There are many known facts about the author/poet's life and there are almost as many aspects that are not known. In this cinematic story the writers (Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare) appear to want to explore the concept of murders based on Poe's famous stories and present these mysteries as reenactments during Poe's time - Variations on themes - and when taken with that approach in mind the film works very well (despite some significant flaws in the creation of the film as directed by James McTeigue).  The film captures the flavor of the times and the mixing of the stories between fiction and reality makes for an entertaining outing.

Baltimore, 1849 and we find Poe (John Cusack) as a drunkard trying to get his works published by the local newspaper edited by Maddux (Kevin McNally). His devoted assistant is Ivan (Sam Hazeldine). In the midst of Poe's financial decline a series of murders occur, murders that appear to be copies of Poe's many stories, and the police (Detective Fields - the talented Luke Evans - and Captain Hamilton - Brendan Gleason) decide to engage Poe's help in solving them. As a side story Poe is infatuated with his boss's daughter Emily (Alice Eve) and when Emily goes missing Poe s determined to capture the serial killer, even making it known that he would trade his useless life to save Emily's life.  The remainder of the film is a chase to the finish and along the way we learn the references to many of Poe's great poems and stories.

No, this is not a great film, but suspend reality and it is an entertaining mystery movie.  The cast is solid and the special effects are convincing. If the film dawdles too long over certain features it does have other saving graces. But oddly enough, the graphics and the obnoxious music chosen for the closing credits destroy the mood and make the viewer want to simply turn off the film.

My mom and I just finished watching The Raven, the new movie with John Cusack portraying Edgar A. Poe. I just...I don't understand what went through the screen-writer's head or the director's head, or anyone's head who was involved with this project. This movie is a disgrace for any lover of literature and Poe fanatics, like I am, in particular.
Since when do we have to turn our historical figures into practically action figures for them to be fascinating? Why is Poe's real life, the one we know about, that has been documented, not good enough? Why does there have to be a crazy, Da Vinci Code style run-around for anyone to pay attention to his works? It's frustrating and saddening to think that one of this country's greatest writers is reduced to a few lines in a movie that has basically nothing to do with him more than Cusack using his name.
There are so many historical inaccuracies. Language choices that are bizarre, with words that were not in use in the 1800s and with Poe cursing as if he really were a madman, when the majority of real sources depict him as almost shy in speech. Cusack portrays him like a psychotic wash-out who couldn't write another word unless the love of his life is in danger and depending on his stories to save her life. And who is this love? Not Virginia. Oh, no, that would be too accurate for this movie. No. The most that is mentioned of Virginia is about thirty seconds somewhere in the middle of the movie, giving no sense of the fascinating relationship they actually had. They just mentioned she was his wife and she died. Well, la-dee-da, she's just a footnote on his search for a madman who has his real love, Miss Hamilton, in his clutches.
I just don't understand what the point of this movie was. I really thought it would have more about his life, about Muddy and Virginia, about anything that was factual. About ten minutes into the movie, I really would have taken anything, any bit of history, but it was practically nonexistent.
All of this to say that if you are a fan of Poe, if you revere writers in general and would feel offended, as I felt, by the use of his name and works for cheap entertainment, then stay as far away from this nonsense as possible.",1349740800,6,2340,4.456876456876457

I would probably have seen this movie even if it was a B-Grade terrible film. Luckily, it is not. Both the brilliant acting of Mr. Cusack and the story itself are wonderful, believable, and intelligent. Cusack is mesmerizing as Poe. He has mastered every ounce of his personality, and physical attributes. He not only acts like him, his very countenance is the same. The writers entwined both the historical details of Poe's last few days into a thriller/mystery involving a serial killer named Reynolds. Anyone that knows anything about Poe's last living day and death will know that his last spoken words were ""Reynolds"". Were they the rantings of a dying/mad man, or was there a more grisly reason he kept reiterating that name. That is what this movie is about. Attempting to unravel a fictionalized version of the. events leading up to his death, the cause of which has continued to perplex historians and fans alike. The actual cause of his death is unknown and has been attributed to a myriad of reasons: alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs (which has been proven to have been false), heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and quite possibly cooping (murdering citizens who were forced to vote for selective candidates). A few of the more devoted Poe fans may realize that the second murder victim from the Pit and the Pendulum was none other than Griswold (Poe's adversary in real life). I found it quite interesting that the writers would choose him to be the next victim, considering how vital he was in attempting to diminish Poe's credibility and legacy after his death in real life with his malicious and false memoir ""Memoir of the Author"".",1349740800,,1774,4.858085808580858

The Raven does not take off until the copycat killer's pendulum slices an unsuspecting victim's torso in half, a moment that will make any Roger Corman fan smile with glee.

The director had so much fun, he lets the killer best our hero in an inevitable climax that ends right where our journey begins.

Loud, bawdy, arrogant, disturbed, conceited, witty, sharp; everything you just know Poe was in person. His 19th century barbs were deliciously creative and delightfully fun to watch. The disappointment was... pretty much the rest of the movie. The plot was mediocre, a mixture of ""Silence of the Lambs"" (without the amazing psychologically creepy factor) and ""Seven"" (with twice the graphic gore). I enjoyed the acting of ""Fields"" (the main detective), he was intense, devoted, and exuded a beautiful sense of fairness and justice. The rest was just... too predictable. Killer leaves a clue, police arrive just in time to find a gory murder with Poe-esque flavor from one of his stories. Killer leaves another clue, police arrive... well, you get the picture. That repeats several times. The whole thing seems plot-less and pointless. We don't care enough about Emily to care that she's missing and held hostage. The killer's motive is vague and empty and leaves you thinking ""huh?"" at the end of the movie. He's a Hannibal-ish wannabe with none of the creepiness, brilliance, or passion. I also found myself disappointed in the idea that Poe would start to doubt himself and his writings, presumably because they were the fodder for the killer/kidnapper's ideas. The real Poe was far too conceited and ingenius to suddenly sit down and think ""Gosh.. maybe I suck.. all of my stories might kill my girlfriend.. maybe I shouldn't have written anything, ever, at all"". WHAT? No way. I know the writer's threw that in for some introspective mush, but it made me squirm with distaste.

So, it was uber-fun to see Poe brought to life by John Cusack (again, great job, woohoo!), but the rest was just... meh... too foggy-mysterious-night-in-London-ish... too uninspired and taking too many ideas from other films.",1342396800,3,1933,5.003105590062112
4866974,3,B005S9EJGO,"It starts out innocent enough. A reinterpretation of King Arthur and the Roman empire. Some more histories based on one iota of fact. Then we get a retelling of Robin Hood and stories of the Middle Ages, Shakespeare, and the next thing you know Abe Lincoln is killing vampires and zombies. Now Poe. It seems as the liberties with history has become progressively worse.

This is a fictional story using the real character of Poe, his works, that fact he lived in Baltimore and not much more. The writers of the script wanting to ward off such criticisms have Poe ask, ""Is imagination a felony?"" Poe teams up with Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) to find Emily (Alice Eve) who is being held by a man who is killing people in the manner of Poe's tales.

There were a number of things that I didn't like in this blockbuster, first being Cusack's portrayal of Poe himself. It wasn't convincing for me. The opening scene of a full moon, a raven, and a woman screaming was a little too cliche. I felt insulted that the writer thought he could get away with such a shallow script. This is not a good horror story, not a good slasher film, not a good pseudo history, not a good mystery, and not a good love story. It does have a certain amount of appeal to it, but nor worth to go run out and see.

Poe fans do not need to feel they have to rush out and watch this film. The film doesn't really catch his genius and madness.

Parental guide: one F-bomb, no sex, no nudity, some Alice Eve cleavage. No music by the Alan Parson's Project.",1342224000,3,1564,4.401384083044983
4866975,2,B005S9EJGO,"Morbid but not fascinating, ""The Raven"" is one of the darkest films the year. Literally. Most of this fictionalized, ridiculous account of writer Edgar Allen Poe's final hours takes place at night in 1849 - 25 years before the popularization of the light bulb. Director James McTeigue is determined to stay honest. So mist, murk and half-seen figures rule. The insides of your eyelids - drawing like shades out of boredom - tend to create darkness, too.

Poe (played here by John Cusack) died at 40 in a Baltimore hospital four days after after a local man discovered him delirious on a park bench. ""The Raven"" - named after his most famous poem, which has little to do with this film - supplies a reason for Poe's state. Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare's screenplay is crude and cynical: A copycat serial killer, staging his crimes in homage to Poe's accumulated horror stories, is on the loose, challenging the poet to...write something? Catch him?

And that's the meat of it. ""The Raven"" makes a halfhearted stab at depicting Poe's actual life - booze tabs, financial struggles, romantic woes - before plunging into the plot. The police captain (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) wears a pained look, Poe's pretty girlfriend with the two front teeth (Alice Eve) pauses and whispers a lot, while her wealthy dad (Brendan Gleeson) puffs and gloats. A number of Poe's stories - notably ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" - are used as ""inspiration"" for the murders. Based on his muddled motive, the killer is a nut, but he goes through a lot of planning and trouble despite what appears to be on-the-fly decisions.

Cusack's best performances are studies in subtlety and counterpunch humor; he doesn't start a ribbing match, but he finishes it. In ""The Raven,"" Poe is loud, tortured and fond of yelling ""Philistine!"" A bigger, more bankable name than any of the cast and crew combined, why didn't Cusack tailor the script to his strengths? Why even accept the job? After all: Do you want to see a movie about Hemingway in which a handyman stages a murder to look like suicide?

McTeigue (""V for Vendetta"") and his screenwriters don't give much room for the work itself aside from a handful of readings to women, who, along with serial killers, appear to be Poe's primary fans. If Poe's genius involved a devotion to his writing method, the film based on his death, of all things, is hardly concerned.",1337904000,11,2416,4.814457831325301
4866996,4,B005S9EJGO,"Edgar Allan Poe did not have a very happy life. He was met with tragedy throughout his life. He was found gravely ill in Baltimore, Maryland dressed in clothes not his own and spouting incomprehensible phrases. It's said that one of the things he kept repeating over and over was the name ""Reynolds."" The screenwriters and filmmakers of THE RAVEN have used the strange death of Edgar Allan Poe as the event that ties the story together.

THE RAVEN is set in Baltimore in 1849. Poe (John Cusack) has returned to Baltimore. He's broke and he can't get the local newspaper to publish his latest review. However, he's also a man in love. The woman of his affection, Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) is the daughter of a wealthy and prominent businessman who hates Poe with a passion. Unbeknownst to Poe, there was a series of murders committed the night before that resemble the murders in his story, ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue."" Police Detective Fields (Luke Evans) brings in Poe for questioning and after deciding that he is not the murderer brings Poe aboard the case as a consultant. The murderer is playing a game with both the police and Poe and the crimes he commits all resemble murders from Poe's stories. The stakes become higher as the game goes as Poe and Fields rush to solve the case and stop the killings.

John Cusack does a great job as always. Cusack has starred in some decent movies as well as some not so great ones. However, even the ones that aren't so good are worth watching because of Cusack. He's just a great actor to watch. Luke Evans does a decent job as Detective Fields and Kevin McNally is fun as newspaper editor Maddox. Alice Eve isn't really given much to do; she's a damsel in distress and not much more.

THE RAVEN does play around with some of the ""facts"" of Poe's last days on Earth (his last few days are, to this day, shrouded in mystery). It also has several anachronisms (such as the word ""serial killer"" that is used). Like many of Poe's stories, the movie is also extremely violent. Lastly, the film builds to a climax that is rather anti-climatical.

With that said, I enjoyed THE RAVEN. It's action packed and is full of Poe references (both from his real life and from his bibliography). It has the potential to inspire younger people (who otherwise might completely avoid reading) to explore the author and read some of his works. It's grisly fun and actually kept me guessing who the killer was until just before the reveal.

The movie has been criticized by some for playing loose and fast with the facts of Poe's life and turning him into a modern detective hero. These criticisms are unfounded. Poe is the father of the modern detective story. His short stories influenced both Wilkie Collins and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It's not inconceivable that Poe could have actually made a great detective.

Also, the literary & historical mashups are all the rage right now. The characters in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE are zombie fighters, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter, Queen Victoria is a demons hunter, and Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy join forces to fight off a zombie horde in a video game sequence. Some of these stories aren't written very good, but overall, I like the historical and literary mashups. THE RAVEN unfolds in the spirit of a mashup and though the ending leaves something to be desired, the way it portrays Poe doesn't dishonor the author, but pays homage to him instead.",1336262400,2,3436,4.6430921052631575
4866997,1,B005S9EJGO,"Some SPOILER ALERTS though it doesn't really matter since the movie is ""spoiled"" to begin with.  Speaking of ""begin"" I'll start at the end.  If I walked into the theatre whilst the credits were rolling I would have thought I was coming in on a James Bond movie.  What's with the banal, Bondish song?  Who knows?  But then again there is a lot in this flick that makes no sense. For one thing, where did the villain get the money or the time to build a gigantic pendulum to dispatch a single victim, just so as to entice and embroil Poe in his preposterous, impossible plot? Why does Poe have a pet raccoon when cats were his feline muses? Why is the final Parisian scene more convincing in its depiction of a city than anything in the rest of the Baltimore-based film?  Why does a newspaper refer to a ""Serial Killer"" when the phrase wasn't even used in those days?  Why is this movie called THE RAVEN anyway? Why does Poe as played by John Cusack have a goatee?  Why doesn't Poe as played by John Cusack speak with a Southern accent? It isn't enough for an actor to put on the period clothes; he must be able to get into the character's skin!  Of course the script wasn't much for Mr. Cusack to sink his teeth in - but I never felt for one scintilla of a second that Cusack's Poe could ever actually write anything of literary value anyhow.

This is just one of the many tragic sadnesses in the life and afterlife of poor Edgar Allan Poe: no one has ever made a good movie about him and his life.  Sylvester Stallone pondered the project which was to be based on his own contemporaneous-with ROCKY long-buried script - and Robert Downey Jr. was highly considered for the lead. Now Robert Downey Jr. would be the perfect Poe.  He looks much more like him that Cusack - and he is a much better actor.  Downey also had his own mind-twisting addictions and demons to battle - and all of his own personal torments might have added dark dimensions to his scheduled and then scrapped portrayal.  Probably, even in a film by Sly! But what happens in the culturally crippled world of most movies nowadays?  Instead, THE RAVEN gets made - and the true story of Edgar Allan Poe doesn't.  Yet - for anyone who knows anything about the Divine Edgar - his actual story is more exciting, more intense, more horrifying than anything to be found in this movie.  And instead of someone somewhere utilizing the true thespic talents of Robert Downey Jr. - in a Poe biopic for example! - where do we find Mr. Downey instead?  In multi-million dollar, CGI intensive, cinematic comic books!  Or as a souped-up, James Bondish Sherlock Holmes who has very little in common with Conan Doyle's actual creation.

And the world has this to look forward to: soon a great many of ill-informed movie goers will be clued in as to the true scoop story of Abraham Lincoln.  Yes, it isn't enough that arguably the greatest President we ever had held the country together during the Civil War and ended up abolishing slavery - no, there was much more! Old Abe was, in fact, a Vampire Hunter!  At least audiences will have Spielberg's Lincoln biopic to look forward to as an antidote. But not so, it appears, with poor Edgar Poe.

Back to THE RAVEN.  This movie had two big things potentially going for it.  It could have been a truly insightful portrait of Poe and offered viewers a truly mystifying mystery.  But it does neither.  It fails as history and it fails as mystery. Anyhow, I doubt if even Vincent Price could have saved this flick.",1336262400,12,3507,4.473270440251572
4866998,4,B005S9EJGO,"There are many who seek to entertain by illustrating the darker elements of human existence. Murder, intrigue, the macabre. One of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, author to do so was Edgar Allen Poe. Most have been lucky enough to have never experienced the horror they put on the page brought to life. In this latest John Cusack film, Poe is not so lucky.

  We first see Poe (played by Cusack) in the last days of his life. The event depicted has been the subject of debate among historians but, for dramatic purposes, it's accepted as fact and I take no issue with that. Days earlier, a woman and child are found and have been murdered in a grisly manner. The murderer managed to flee the scene despite the doors being locked when the police arrived and windows that appeared to be nailed shut. An investigator, Detective Emmett Fields (played by Luke Evans) discovers how the killer concealed his escape and recognizes that the inspiration for the trickery was a work of fiction produced by Poe. He is the prime suspect until another murder is committed while he is being questioned. It appears to be inspired by yet another work of Poe's and so Fields (Evans) hopes that involving the man who used to be his prime suspect might allow him to gain some advantage over the murderer who's now claimed the lives of three innocent people. All the while Poe is madly in love with the daughter of a respected military officer who cannot stand him. But when Emily (Poe's love interest, played by Alice Eve) is in jeopardy, the Captain (Emily's father, played by Brendan Gleeson) and Poe put their differences aside and work together to save the one person they both love more than anything.

  Now, I believed this was Cusack's first film since 2009's 2012. In fact, I'd forgotten about Hot Tub Time Machine which followed that as did two other films I never even knew about. Also noteworthy is the fact that, of numerous works based on or otherwise connected to Poe and his publications, this is the third to be given the title The Raven. But even with all that against it, this film is entertaining. No member of the cast should hold their breath waiting for an Oscar nomination. Neither should anyone who was involved behind the scenes, but it's an involving tale in an interesting setting with a well-acted cast and I liked it.",1336176000,3,2331,4.645631067961165
4866999,3,B005S9EJGO,"I usually don't post a review here if dozens or more beat me to it, as everything I have to say is probably already said.  But as I write this just a handful of THE RAVEN reviews appear, yet Joseph P. Menta's May 1, 2012, review says almost everything I wanted to express about this film.

All I can add is THE RAVEN starts off great, focusing on John Cusack's fine performance as Edgar Allan Poe.  But as the second act commences, THE RAVEN stops being about Poe, moving into a serial murder mystery.  The story demotes the Poe character to a supporting role, and THE RAVEN loses steam.

I hoped THE RAVEN would get back to being about Edgar Allan Poe and forget about who done it, and while to the filmmakers' credit it never bores, this movie leaves its main character behind in the chase.  THE RAVEN reminds me of what the late critic Gene Siskal said about Paul McCartney's film GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET: When you have someone as fascinating as McCartney, why waste the opportunity with fiction when you could instead just portray him being him?

THE RAVEN might be better if, instead of introducing us to Edgar Allan Poe and then taking the spotlight off him, it would be either just a work about Poe or a serial killer mystery where the star is, say, an English scholar who helps police crack a case when it appears the perpetrator is a Poe fanatic.",1336176000,9,1363,4.428
4867000,3,B005S9EJGO,"One day in college I stayed up far too late playing a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) and forgotten that I had an English quiz the next day.  Completely unprepared, I walked into the room ready to accept my fate, only to discover the topic was Edgar Allen Poe.  I had been reading Poe's ""Annabel Lee"" the night before for fun (this is what English majors do).  Could I pull it off? I imagine James McTeigue felt the same way when directing ""The Raven,"" but instead of one professor, thousands of English majors would be grading his paper.

""The Raven"" begins with a murder of a woman and her child. Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) is the mild-mannered, well-read detective who makes the connection.  It's not long before he realizes the murderer was inspired by Poe's story, ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue."" Meanwhile, Poe (John Cusack, sporting a trademark high forehead and goatee) is a penniless alcoholic in love with the lovely Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve).  Her father (Brendan Gleeson) violently disagrees with the nature of their relationship.  It's not long before Poe's romantic issues collide with the murder plot and the erstwhile author is fighting for the love of his life.

On its surface, ""The Raven"" is an American version of a Sherlock Holmes mystery: drug-addled genius navigates the 19th century criminal underworld allied with an underequipped police force. Unfortunately, Cusack's Poe doesn't measure up to Downey's performance. Poe is a crotchety sort, less lovable than Holmes, and the material never manages to elevate Poe above the Cliff Notes we know about him: he pines for a woman, drinks a lot, and verbally eviscerates everyone within ear's reach.

The murders are fun if you remember the short stories, which I'm ashamed to admit I haven't read since college.  But McTeigue runs a fine line between crafting an entertaining tale and adhering closely to the material.  Emily Hamilton appears to be a stand-in for Sarah Helen Whitman. The inspiration for ""Annabel Lee"" is widely believed to be Poe's first wife, Virginia Clemm...his 13-year-old cousin, a fact conveniently left out of the film.

The special effects occasionally fall flat, like the ""Pit and the Pendulum"" scene.  Given that Fields is such a logical investigator, it's curious he never looks into the massive amount of work necessary to construct a clockwork pendulum. Ra's al Ghul figured out who Batman was once by the massive amount of computer processors he purchased for his Batcave!

""The Raven"" wants to have it all: a period piece with its lack of contractions in the dialogue, an eloquent series of rants on the state of literature by Poe, and anachronisms like ""serial killer"" and modern investigative techniques.  It waffles between all three modes without quite reconciling the discrepancy.

The biggest problem is how ""The Raven"" was edited.  Emily is kidnapped by simply disappearing off screen.  It's almost as if the director changed his mind as to how she was going to exit and then didn't have the budget to go back and film it.  This is a recurring problem; chase scenes begin without it being clear who is chasing who.

Fans of Poe know there are no happy endings for him.  Unfortunately, given the lack of firm direction, sloppy editing, and wooden acting, they don't end well for the audience either. But then, if you love Poe's work there's still some charm to be found here for those who remember their literature...which is how I get an A- on that pop quiz.",1336089600,8,3464,4.9073756432247
4867001,3,B005S9EJGO,"Good myths start with some real person and element of truth, then aggrandize both to heroic proportions. And, to a myth-maker or conspiracy theorist, there's nothing more appealing than the missing moment. In this case, McTeigue (no conspiracy theorist, as far as I know) dives into the missing moments before the true death of the near-mythic Edgar Allan Poe.

This movie takes on that wholly unknown moment, the lost days before Poe's ill-understood demise. It projects, into that blank space, an adventure far more thrilling than historical records or knowledge of Poe's character can justify. Well, Poe isn't the first famous figure to suffer this posthumous indignity, and I can't believe he'll be the last. The scriptwriters hang an exciting if otherwise ordinary story across that chasm, suspended between known facts, and create a fair adventure. If you ignore the literal, historical Poe, it's actually quite enjoyable.

The costume drama is fun, the cat-and-mouse killer theme works well within Poe's oeuvre, and the drama is suitably dramatic. If you can just not think about everything you know of the historical Poe and his era, it's a romp. Just don't let your lit snob friend to see it with you.

4867002,3,B005S9EJGO,"""The Raven"", a fictional horror thriller featuring the non-fictional literary figure Edgar Allan Poe, was well crafted and never less than adequately watchable, but I really expected more.  While calling the film cartoony and childish would be way too critical, I thought there was a broadness and simplicity to the proceedings that made the movie veer away from some potentially very interesting waters.

I'm just thinking aloud here, but I would have loved to see a fictional Poe film set in the months prior to his death in 1849, one that made a genuine attempt at showing viewers what Poe was like, what demons bedeviled him, that sort of thing.  The device of the fictional detective story involving Poe could have illuminated the non-fictional aspects of his life, aspects that contributed to his tragic, premature death.

But, no, here we get a sanitized, generally likable Poe with only the barest nods to the man's excesses, depression, and hardships. To be fair here, the film at least mentions that Poe lost his young wife to tuberculosis and that the tragedy still haunted him. But not all that much, according to this movie.  There also isn't much grittiness or realism in the depiction of Baltimore in 1849, even though numerous crime scenes in bad parts of town are depicted.  There was more moody darkness in the Robert Downey Jr. ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies.

Finally, worse than the broadness evident in the depictions of characters and locations, the movie didn't even give poor Poe the dignity of his inherent flaws when it came to his death.  In other words, flattering or not, Poe's demons and weaknesses were part of who he was and why he died, and that should have been shown in the movie.  But, no, here we are given a contraption-like plot development (I won't get more specific in case you're planning to see the film) that's responsible for Poe dying.  What bothered me about that?  Well, it's not so much that the plot contrivance painted Poe and his demise in a better light (to the point of making him downright heroic, in fact); it's just that, in the end, the revisionist history seemed somehow... disrespectful.  Let the poor man have his demons and weaknesses.

Plusses?  The movie's production design was lavish; the death traps built by the mysterious killer were suitably creepy; there's generous discussion and quoting of Poe's work (especially his poetry); John Cusack did a good job (given the limitations of the script's approach to Poe's character); and I strangely admired the film's willingness to present no-holds-barred gore and violence.  On that last point, the movie ads were selling an adult-oriented horror thriller and, well... we were given an adult-oriented horror thriller.  I appreciated that.

I just wish the adult approach extended beyond the violent, intense aspects of the production.  ""The Raven"" is an okay movie that could have been so much more.",1335830400,42,2908,4.973140495867769

He died, rather mysteriously, at age 40.

What Director James McTeigue aspired to do was brilliantly accomplished, in this epic work of mystery which incorporates the actual life of Poe with fiction.

Phenomenal achievement, really, as to lace them, ohhh, so integrally. I salute him, as Poe would have done in his days at West Point, which were mentioned in the movie along with his two loves; first his young cousin of a wife who died of Tuberculosis, first signs truly evident at the piano, as mentioned, and the other love, of his sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster. The $9 he was paid for his first publication was incited, his disdain for Longfellow, as well as a myriad of his actual prose of known works from, ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" all the way to ""Annabel Lee""...which brought the killer into the labyrinth of the fiction element of this film. My heavens, they even included the last publicly known words of Poe, ""Lord, help my poor soul.""

John Cusack's performance was EXPLOSIVE! And his lines of the time I cherish so, were perfectly articulated with the passion they should be!

And not too many present-day special effects, except a close-up of a slow-moving bullet, which was actually a fabulous adornment.

C'est Magnifique is all I can say of this movie...of course I did close my eyes to the more bloody scenes, which flitted as fireflies on a summers night. So be it.

Oh yes, and I dearly loved these enscripted words to touch my heart, said by Cusack/Poe:

""If I would have known my work would have such an effect on people, I would have devoted more of my time to eroticism.""

Well, my dear Edgar, how honored I am as to cover that for thee, in ""My Secret Husband.""

Most grateful to have had the opportunity to view this production.
