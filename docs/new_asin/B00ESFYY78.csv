5939941,5,B00ESFYY78,"If you are a fan of Hell's Kitchen then this is a must. It is so much cheaper if you purchase this is as a set.  If you are not a fan?  I would suggest Watching not just season 1, but go through season 3.  If you don't like it by then? Most likely it's not for you.  But as A fan, I could not be happier.  I am not sure why season 11 is not out as that is the only season that is left.  They have not started season 12 as of yet but they will this year as they are under contract to do so. Now each season comes with a plastic disk set as if you were to order one season. But they do pair a few seasons up placing two seasons in one set.  But never more then two seasons to a set. And all 10 seasons make up this box set. You get all kind of behind scenes you would never see anywhere including youtube, and you get some insight to what goes on and how Gordon and his personality is when the camera's are not rolling for the show. He is funny, engaging, and really helpful to the young chefs hoping for a shot at the coveted title.  I just cant see how anyone can go wrong getting this as a gift, or for themselves.  I loved it. As I watched it, my sister managed to claim it for her own. So now I must purchase another one.  For 59.99 I think it is a complete steel!  Treat yourself to all this show has to offer, and most of all the scenes you don't see, and the interaction between the chefs and Gordon that make it so you cant take your eyes off the screen.  I know they could come out with two more seasons, one more for sure, and then maybe another box set, but for me it was still worth every penny.  I know we all can find somewhere in a month where we throw away 59.99 in a month. Save that, and use it for countless hours of entertainment.  Watch and enjoy....The personalities of the contestants, sous chef's, and Gordon is just priceless.  5 stars all the way!!!",1389484800,15,1874,3.9206349206349205

5939943,5,B00ESFYY78,"Hell's Kitchen box set, what's not to love! Now I can relive all of Gordon's ""This looks like a dogs dinner"" comments over and over again. I usually watch this on Hulu, but commercials have pretty much ruined it, even with a paid subscription, and they seem to have removed older seasons.  Now I can see all my favorite moments any time I want.

Nice box set, compact for 10 seasons.",1387065600,9,383,4.380281690140845

5939950,3,B00ESFYY78,"I'm a huge Hell's Kitchen fan. Let me tell you, the 3 stars isn't for the show; it's the dvds themselves.
Almost one DVD per season (1-5) have some sort of scratch or simply don't play well. I understand a few second delays or quality issues. I would have an episode stop and never start up again. I would have episodes not start when selected on the menu screen. I've had to skip a whole episode because the images would skip and it was a jumbled mess for the entire episode. I continued on past season 5 and only a few seasons work perfectly. Season 8 was wonderful and I'm making my way through 10 with no problems. 9 had an episode stop and I had to skip it.
Now, I received a card along with the DVD that stated before returning, email VEI customer service and if it falls under certain conditions, a replacement would be sent (if available).
No, I haven't received an email back yet. I emailed them around March 10th. It is currently April 2nd.
No, it's not my DVD player because my other DVDs work just fine.
I love Hell's Kitchen and this is a dream to have but turned into a huge disappointment.

EDIT: Since receiving a replacement, nothing truly has changed. I tried disc one of season 4 and season 5. The disc are in nice shape but will not play with my DVD player. Disc two of season 4 plays like a charm but that's skipping a 1/3 of the season.",1491091200,5,1358,4.243243243243243
5939951,5,B00ESFYY78,This was my favorite purchase to date!  It has been so much for fun for my husband and I to watch the first 10 seasons of Hell's Kitchen.

They have no scratches on them,, just every once in a while it will freeze like watching satelite tv and the signal gets crappy and then the movie just freezes bleeps in and out then I end up skipping scenes until it starts going again.  Only two really bad spots so far,,on season 8 currently,,  and a couple small ones.

5939971,5,B00ESFYY78,"A Great Box set and price for the complete first 10 seasons of Hell's Kitchen. The Box set is divided into 6 cases containing seasons 1-3. 4&5. 6&7, 8, 9, and 10. The seasons are a thrill to watch, the only censoring in the box set are the scenes that contain partial nudity, however I only saw about three/four times out of about 5400 minutes. The only issues are at times there are noticeable choppy editing errors when it comes to getting rid of the commercial breaks, but it's not something that will ruin the experiences of watching the best moments of Chef Ramsey in an uncensored 10 season box set.",1446508800,,605,4.45945945945946

5939974,5,B00ESFYY78,"Excellent box set, a great value.  You're getting 10 seasons of the show uncensored, so if that's what you want you'll be mostly satisfied.

The only downsides:
1. A few of the discs have places where they get stuck for a few minutes.  I have watched season 1 thru 6 so far, and have had to skip about 10 minutes total out of all those discs due to problems.

2, Only a few of the seasons have extras, such as outtakes and interviews and mini-documentaries.  One season had about 30 seconds to a minute after each episode of stuff that wasn't in the episode, and some of it was great.  It's unfortunate they didn't do that for all the seasons.

Regardless of the slight flaws, it's a great deal on a great show.  I hope they do another box set for the later seasons.",1444003200,,766,4.270833333333333

5939978,4,B00ESFYY78,"It's a treat to hear the full and uncensored battles of Hell's Kitchen. I also appreciate the excellent bonus features and interviews included with the seasons. I take a point off for the lack of subtitles, clearly a cheap-blank budgetary decision by the DVD maker and a disservice to viewers who are language-impaired. Great to see a younger Chef Ramsay, and also amusing to see the extra brusque treatment that Ramsay gives season one dining customers (something he cleaned up in subsequent seasons).

Edited to add: Watch the episodes past the closing credits. They have added bonus footage after the credits rather than (as is normal DVD practice) putting bonus material in a separate menu. At least starting with Season 3, didn't check the previous seasons. Thanks for the new background material!",1441843200,5,802,5.075757575757576
5939979,3,B00ESFYY78,"As a bachelor who only heats food up in the microwave, I enjoy watching cooking reality shows which teach you about food and the amazing skills chefs display in cooking competitions.  Since I'd seen all the seasons of Top Chef, I decided to give this a try.

For the boxed set, you certainly can't argue with the value of the boxed set for ten full seasons.

On the other hand, I found the show to be repetitive and shallow.  Having Gordon Ramsey drop perhaps 100+ F-bombs on the contestants per season just isn't that impressive.  He expects obedience and respect, but he shows very LITTLE respect for the contestants if they make mistakes under immense pressure.

Frankly, I highly prefer Top Chef.  When you get beyond all the BS ""drama"" of this show and the Top Chef seasons, the actual content about cooking and food seems much more diverse and informative on Top Chef. Also, I can respect the quiet but thoughtful and respectful way that chef Tom Colecio (or the guest chefs) objectively criticize mistakes about the dishes on Top Chef.  It's a MUCH different experience than watching an enraged egotistic Gordon Ramsey drop a bunch of F-bombs in drill-sargent fashion.  For military training, I understand the all-stress method of training, which is tried and true through the ages.  For a cooking contest, not so much -- it's just over the top, IMO.

5 stars for value and packaging, for 10 full seasons.

2 stars for repetitiveness and lack of imagination over the seasons.  Too much ""drama"", too little focus on the food.

3 stars overall, as other cooking shows often have too much drama vs. actual food coverage as well.",1440892800,,1632,4.74113475177305

Each season comes in its own individual wrapped DVD container all put together in one big box. The packaging is really great, either as a gift or part of a collection. However the quality of the discs themselves is lacking. Three of the disks would not play without being wiped several times with a cloth as the DVD player could not recognize them. For one of the seasons, the last disc automatically started at the announcement of the winner and not at the start of the second to last episode where it should have.

So it's a mixed review, and thus a mediocre star rating. Good packaging and doesn't take up a lot of room for 10 seasons, however poor quality.",1414886400,,752,4.449275362318841

You hear every word spoken in the kitchen and dorms that you don't necessarily want your young children to hear even if they may have heard them in the playground.

The DVD's are not great quality.  The color shifts around in many of them.  The sound is fine.  A couple of episodes wouldn't play at all.  I don't care about this much, because at the price I'm willing to put up with a few glitches.  I'd recommend this set for those who want a Hell's Kitchen fix now and then.  For me, Hell's Kitchen is a rather unique show. A study in human nature, one sees what lengths some people will go to in order to obtain a prize they don't deserve.",1413158400,2,652,4.201612903225806

Especially upset my last DVD for season 1 ended before the last dinner service so I did not even get to see who won (tho I already knew), but kept replaying and trying again and again, but nope. It just ended when they were doing prep for their last dinner. I have struggled with the 5 seasons so far having to try re-tracking, reinstalling the dvd, but nothing helps and it will cost me more to send it back than its forth the effort. Really a shame no one inspects these things for quality since my dvd player has no problem with any other one I have ever shown.",1407801600,,728,4.244604316546763

Completely uncensored you hear every bad word in the dictionary and then some more. With this box set having 10 seasons all in one you save more money then getting all the same dvds seperatly.

One thing I wish they would improve-this was not labeled as uncensored that I noticed on the site. We didn't realize it until the box arrived. It would be nice to versions that are and are not bleeped for those who get tired of the bad language. We didn't think of that sooner because we always watched on TV",1402099200,,455,4.241379310344827

I'm very disappointed that it wasn't in better shape especially for the price I had to pay for them. I would love nothing more than to have a new set sent to me but I have waited long enough to watch all of these and I don't want to have to wait for another set to be sent to me.

8608901,4,B00ESFYY78,"As much as I love seeing uncensored Gordon Ramsey here, most of the discs worked just fine. However, several discs did have some problems, ranging from unreadable, to read delays to downright stopping on some episodes. That if we go for nitpicking, on the back of the box, Ramsey's name is spelled ""chef ramsey"" in lower case lettering.

I resorted to torrenting to watch the affected discs I couldn't access on my DVD drive, unfortunately. Whoever produced the disc set should have put more TLC/quality control into setting things up with these. Maybe I am one of the unlucky minority who got some faulty discs but I am overall mostly satisfied with this set.",1505865600,,660,4.7894736842105265

8608905,2,B00ESFYY78,"This will be a little lengthy but if I can save people some trouble I will. There are quite a few people mentioning playback issues and I know why.  The show itself is awesome, we all know Gordon rocks!  However, the way the manufacturer made the discs creates playback issues.  The manufacturer is cramming far too many episodes on a single disc which results in poor playback or the disc not playing at all!

For example Season 1 which has 11 episodes, the entire season is crammed onto only 2 discs.  With disc 1 having a whopping 7 episodes on it and a run time of over 4 1/2 hours.  I've never seen a DVD with that many episodes on it before.  A TV show with a run time of 43-45 minutes on average has 4 episodes on a disc (5 at the most).  I did a little research and saw that Season 1 DVD of Hell's Kitchen by itself has 3 discs, not 2.  I did some more research and I found this pattern with just about all of the seasons.

I can't help but to think that's why this box set is such a ""steal"" it's because they're skimping on the quality.  I don't think Mr. Ramsay (with his standards) would take too kindly to that.  I returned this set and proceeded with ordering the seasons individually.  Yeah, it will cost more but at least I'll be able to enjoy the show like I should.",1500422400,,1282,4.1417004048583
8608906,3,B00ESFYY78,Several discs were malfunctioning. Discs season 6&7 episodes 6-15 kept skipping and freezing. Season 8 didn't play at all. Very disappointing. An expensive mistake for my son's birthday gift,1498348800,,190,5.586206896551724
