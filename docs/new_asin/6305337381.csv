8212790,1,6305337381,"This shonky production gives a new dimension to the term 'exploitation'. The DVD cover lists the running time as 85 minutes. It isn't. The total running time of the disc is 73 mins. To compound the deceit the running time of the story, such as it is, is a mere 59 mins. The balance of the time is taken up with a 14 min credit crawl. That's longer than the credit crawls for Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments combined. It's painfully slow and is plainly done for the sole purpose of padding out the disc. Don't waste your time looking for the director's commentary and Behind The Scenes mentioned on the cover. They're nowhere to be found. A complete disgrace.",1067040000,34,659,4.5
