8481781,3,B005OT7Y6K,"For certain there are provocative elements for its day contained within the narrative of ""The Couch"" like patricide and incest but by today's standards they are quite dated.  The film plays like a homage (rip-off?) of Hitchcock most notably ""Psycho"" but that comparison only demonstrates why this film is lacking.  Puzzling because Robert Bloch who wrote the story that was the basis for ""Psycho"" wrote the script here based on a story by Blake Edwards and Owen Crump.  I think you can look no further than the flat direction of Crump and a ham-handed lead performance by star Grant Williams who won't make you forget Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates.  A curio at best that earns its obscurity.",1445731200,,691,4.880341880341881
8481782,4,B005OT7Y6K,"From 1961 comes this tale of early psychiatric care. The star is Grant Williams and the poor man shrieks a lot, his psychiatrist gets in his face all the time as he lies on the couch and Shirley Knight? what was she doing here, no talent actress, no emotion at all. The cop was the best, if you ask me. Okay I got that out of my system. All in all, it is a fun little movie. The overacting aside I did like it contrary to what you may think this review is saying, you have to keep in mind this was made in 1961, bad acting and over the top acting was the order of the day. don't think too much and just fly along with the nuttiness.",1438128000,2,632,3.9069767441860463
8481783,3,B005OT7Y6K,"Robert Bloch may have authored the screenplay based on an idea by Blake Edwards and director Owen Crump, but the execution of the film is rather formulaic.  Grant Williams is the star and he seems to wear sparklers.  Shirley Knight, in an early role, shows what a great beauty she brought to Hollywood, but she appears vapid next to Williams.  Anne Helm, Elvis's main squeeze in """"Follow That Dream"" and other films, has the role of the alluring girl next door that fails to ignite Williams's arousal.  Once again she is good and should have been better known than ending up opposite Tommy Kirk in ""Mother Goose a Go-Go (AKA: ""The Unkissed Bride"").""  I guess the real fault I have with the movie lay in Bloch's script.  Comparing it to Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" (because Bloch wrote the original novel of ""Psycho"") and ""Psycho""'s script was by Joseph Stefano and directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  It seems like he just blocked out another script with clues paced ever so tidily.  The suspense is a little intense and is palpable, but there is a lot screaming contrived. Warner Bros gave it a good advertising campaign it seems, although I do not remember hearing of it before until now.  1962, b&w, Warner Archive.  Really just average.",1424217600,2,1235,4.755868544600939
8481784,5,B005OT7Y6K,"Grant Williams was such a fabulous actor and the most beautiful man in movies. He did a very very incredible job in The Couch, at least as good or better than Tony Perkins in Psycho of that year. If you are looking to add a GW movie to your collection you can not go wrong with this movie. Also, deep discount dvds is a great source for obscure videos.",1420243200,3,352,4.115942028985507
8481785,5,B005OT7Y6K,"The totally normal looking Grant Williams would seem to be a poor substitute for Anthony Perkins in this Robert Bloch authored tale of a deranged killer. Grant  didn't achieve the recognition and success he deserved during his lifetime and certainly is almost forgotten today. He was the star of one of the best science fiction movies ever, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man."" This production, co-starring Shirley Knight, is a happy surprise on many levels. It's suspenseful without being gory and does defy expectations. Recommended as one of the few chances to see Grant in a role worthy of his talent. The ill-fated Onslow Stevens does a great job as the psychiatrist.",1363996800,,667,5.0636363636363635
8481786,5,B005OT7Y6K,"The Couch is not a Hitchcock film, but every bit as compelling as any AH classic. And also shares that rare quality of standing the test of time.....",1360540800,,149,4.357142857142857
8481787,5,B005OT7Y6K,"Long lost gem. Grant Williams again creates a classic performance in this strange and unique classic study of a deviated psycho serial killer. Grant succeeds in making us feel sorry for his torrid state of mind. Great supporting cast makes this film one that you can never stop watching over and over again. From a Blake Edwards story adapted by the master of psychological suspense, the honorable Robert Bloch (Psycho fame)I waited 40 years for this film to be released. Additional films written by Bloch include the Night Walker and the Cabinet Of Doctor Caligari. Grab this classic. You will not regret it.",1341446400,2,609,4.922330097087379
8481788,4,B005OT7Y6K,"Here's a taut, twisted little psychological thriller that grabs you with its opening scene -- a killer calmly phoning the police & politely informing them when his next killing will take place, down to the exact minute -- and it doesn't let go, right up to the increasingly intense & nerve-wracking end.

Grant Williams, better known as the sympathetic protagonist of ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" plays someone very different here, and does it well. At times you can understand & pity him, as you begin to realize just how he became as emotionally damaged & dangerous as he is -- but he never becomes any less threatening because of it. A young & luminous Shirley Knight is very good as the somewhat naive girl he ""loves"" -- though ""is obsessed with"" is more accurate. And the fact that she's the niece of his psychiatrist makes it all the more knotty (and naughty).

I don't want to give away any more of the plot. The question is, will the police or his psychiatrist discover the killer's identity & real motivation before it's too late? But every time you think you've got things figured out & know where the story is heading, it takes a completely unexpected turn. It may be a small, unheralded film, but it really delivers the goods -- recommended!",1325894400,6,1256,4.678733031674208
