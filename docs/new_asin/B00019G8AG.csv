8008502,5,B00019G8AG,I just love this video version of this opera. I saw it many years ago and owned it on videotape. I was thrilled to find it in DVD format since my videotape player has gone the way of the dinosaur.,1472169600,,196,3.925
8008503,5,B00019G8AG,Excellent performance of a remarkable opera. Monteverdi was every bit as skilled at bringing out the dark side of human nature as he was the spiritual.,1458950400,,151,4.846153846153846
8008504,4,B00019G8AG,"Maria Ewing is as beautiful and sexy as everyone says, but she is not the only attraction!  Several of the supporting cast are equally fine.  Now I don't have a complete cast list--there is nothing on the package saying who plays Poppea's nurse, Arnalta, but whoever she is she's an abundant, beautiful mezzo.  The sopranos who sing Drusilla, the Damigella, and Amore are also wonderful, as are the supporting tenors, who play Nero's singing buddy (""Cantia-a-a-a-a-am!"") and the Valetto.  Best of all is Robert Lloyd, who sings Seneca with seemingly-limitless depth, and gives the character all his irritating mannerisms.

The weaknesses include Dennis Bailey's hoarse-sounding Nero, and Cynthia Clarey's thin Ottavia.  Ottone is sung by a baritone rather than by the more traditional countertenor.

The sets and costumes are traditional, although the acting is unusually sexy for this period.  It's not just Ewing; the flirtatious scene between the Valetto and Damigella (""Sento un certo non so che..."") is quite racy.",1264291200,9,1019,5.325
8008505,5,B00019G8AG,"Monteverdi at his best. Excellent performances, and great singing. The staging is also apropriately gloomy, which gives an extra mood to the whole opera. Ewing is great as skinny Poppea,and Dennis Bailey with his lusty face fits excellently in the role of Nero-the crazy emperor. This production does it on both levels; acting and singing ,which are on the highest levels.",1169769600,5,372,5.114754098360656
8008506,5,B00019G8AG,"Monteverdi didn't mentioned the instruments in his score, hence there is much room for interpretation.

Luckily, they decided not to be authentic and use modern instruments with all their depth, instead of shallow baroque instruments.

There is also no voice-type specification.

Nero most of the time is sung by a soprano without any good reason. Here he is sung by a tenor.

Poppea's nurse is commonly sung by a tenor (weird...), but here is sung by a strong female alto.

The singers have a dramatic background and are not specialist in the field of baroque opera.

It is actually an advantage!

Lloyd and Ewing stand out.

Even for me, who don't care much for Monteverdi, it was a pleasure to watch and hear.",1149465600,19,712,4.7317073170731705
8008507,5,B00019G8AG,"The Glyndebourne Festival Opera made this a magnificent production of L'Incoronazione di Poppea.  Even if you're not an avid opera fan, you will find that both the music of Monteverdi and the staging of the opera by Glyndebourne will enthrall you.  If you also happen to be interested in foreign languages, you have the added bonus of subtitles in French, German and Spanish, not to mention English.  This recording is really spectacular.  I've only had it a month and I'm afraid I'm going to wear it out because I keep playing certain segments over and over again.  You'll be glad you purchased this one for your collection, I assure you.",1143849600,21,639,4.7727272727272725
8008508,5,B00019G8AG,"This is a wonderful production.  I've watched it four times now, and like it more every time.  I don't know what it is about Monteverdi's music that's so terrific...I love Baroque music, but the passion and feeling in this opera is amazing.  Maria Ewing must be the slinkiest Poppea in operatic history.  Highly recommended",1142553600,8,323,4.925925925925926
8008509,5,B00019G8AG,"In addition to a large collection of (mostly) Baroque operas on CD, I have over 75 operas on DVD, some in more than one version, as well Monteverdi's other two operas on DVD, which are also incredible. But this recording of L'Incoronazione di Poppea takes the cake, whether in terms of the beauty of the music, the effectiveness of the staging and costumes, the quality of the acting and singing of the principals, or even the dramatic and literary intensity of the story. The video recording is a little old, so the picture is slightly grainy, but the sound quality (though only in Dolby stereo) is incomparable, the production and conducting without peer. I am quite sure I will still feel the same after viewing it ten or fifteen times, though so far I have only watched it twice. This is a must-buy for any lover of Baroque music, and it is one of the operatic masterpieces of all time. It should be included in every course in the history of opera.",1083456000,59,953,4.546511627906977
