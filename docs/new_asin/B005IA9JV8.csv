8474472,3,B005IA9JV8,"Many of you know that Mantan Moreland was under consideration as a replacement for Curly Howard. Apparently Moe was lobbying strongly for him, but movie execs were not ready for an African-American stooge. Too bad. What I found out after accidentally buying this set  was that each of these films are available gratis on a popular video web site.

8474479,3,B005IA9JV8,"These 60 minute (+ or - a few minutes) late 30s and early 40s films were commonly shown in theaters as a double feature with a longer movie.  Without the comedic style of Mantan Moreland, they probably would offer little for modern viewers.  They have a nostalgic value if you are old enough to remember bell-boys, elevator operators, soda fountains, etc.  The stories are about amateur detective young Frankie Darro, a shorty who looks like a bell-boy, which he plays in one or two of these movies.  Mantan Moreland is his janitor or porter sidekick, who reluctantly helps him solve crimes.  For the politically correct the role of the black man (Mantan) is demeaning but standard for those days.  Yet his white buddy, Frankie, does not treat him badly, except for encouraging him to get into the same jams he does.  It is fun stuff with Mantan stealing most of the scenes and sometimes getting Frankie out of trouble.  These are not great films but are fun to watch on a rainy evening.",1334448000,17,987,4.664739884393064
