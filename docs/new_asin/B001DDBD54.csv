3528585,4,B001DDBD54,"Ok, so all the other reviews are whining about the lack of special features. Personally, I love these movies, they were the definition of Sci-Fi horror, well, until the AVP wastes.
But I have never watched a special feature, nor have i listened to a director's commentary. I just don't care about those things. I simply want these movies. This pack has them. if you want to own these movies, this is a GREAT deal.
If you care about what the director ordered for lunch on the 5th day of shooting, then spend twice the money and get the special super pack. If not, this pack is for you!",1235001600,43,584,4.36697247706422
3528586,4,B001DDBD54,"First of all, the only reason I gave this a 4-star rating is because there is no 3 1/2. It's not 4-star good but also not 3-star bad.

This set isn't bad for average Alien or Predator fans, and to be honest I kind of liked the AVP titles a little, but for the die hards out there DO NOT BUY THIS! 1st of all with a collection like this it really makes you wonder why it was not released on Blu-Ray. 2nd, the special features are mediocre at best. Wow! I really get the original theatrical trailer for Predetor? That was sarcasm. If you really must own these movies I agree with the review Gregory wrote, buy the Quadrilogy and get the others as stand alone special editions. But if money is an issue then I see no problem with this set. You do get some really good movies, and a few ""less than perfect"" flicks thrown in for a pretty good price. And if special features are of little importance to you there is no reason to skip this one.

So basically put, if your low on cash than this is a good purchase. But if you have got the dough then you can afford to pass this one over and go all out buying them all seperately.",1226707200,30,1121,4.090909090909091
3528587,3,B001DDBD54,"I like the slim packaging (I really wish that all movies were now release in the slim cases...takes up less space).  It would've been nice if a couple of bonus disc with material for Aliens, Predators and AVP would've been included. It's definately cheap to buy this set than all of the movies individually.",1224460800,14,307,4.685185185185185
3528588,2,B001DDBD54,"8 movies. 8 discs. Considering that the Quadrilogy box had 9 discs for 4 movies... let's do the math here. Did you buy the ""Legacy"" boxset and then smack yourself in the forehead upon news of the Quadrilogy? Did you buy the Quadrilogy boxset and then smack yourself in the forehead upon news of the 7-movie, 15-disc ""Ultimate Showdown DVD Collector's Set"" (the one with a comic book, two light-up statues, and two tickets to AVP:R)? Did you buy that boxset and then smack yourself in the forehead upon news of this one? Did you buy the Indiana Jones ""Trilogy"" boxset only to be thwarted by the Crystal Skull? Batman Legacy (4 discs) vs. Anthology (8 discs)? How many Star Trek movie boxsets have there been? Seriously. Wait for the twenty-disc box. It's coming. Be patient.

If you absolutely positively must have some Alien and Predator goodness on DVD right now, buy the Alien Quadrilogy, the 4-disc Predator 1/2 boxset, and the 4-disc AVP/AVP:R boxset. More DVDs. More hours. More stuff to watch.

(or just get the Quadrilogy... the Predator and AVP movies really aren't all that great)

EDIT: Hey guys, guess what? An ""Alien"" prequel project is coming soon with Carl Rinsch directing, and ""Predators"", produced by Robert Rodriguez, is also in the pipeline. It's like I'm telepathic. So yeah, wait until there's a ten-movie boxset with like 25 discs. THAT will be the one to buy (probably).",1223251200,59,1393,4.820083682008368

I picked this up for my girlfriend because she really enjoys the alien movies, she's not a fan of the predator series but when she saw this set she just had to watch every single dvd in the collection. Overall we both enjoyed this collection very much! It's only really missing predators but its perfectly acceptable without it. I Highly recommend this collection for alien/predator fans. Doesn't even need to be purchased on blu-ray, if you have a blu-ray player it automatically makes these dvds HD.

Now Ive heard that the only ""Predator"" DVD and Blu-Ray transfer was done this way so you cant complain because thats how all of them are. Also, my tv is stuck at 1080i (its from 2006) and I watched the Predator DVD on a 480p tv and it looks fine.

Quality is good. Region 1 for all of the dvds in this set. It does not have the Predator film - but I bought it seperate along with prometheus. Great buy for the price!",1497398400,,346,4.257575757575758
