5789030,5,B00DCHWTES,"This was a real surprise--over and over.  When it started I assumed it would be another hustler flick, a cute but messed-up street kid picked up by a lonely guy with predictable chaos ensuing.  No!  Both characters proved to be smart, sophisticated, sympathetic and genuinely interesting, and both characters developed in ways I did not expect.  I found the acting, the writing and the production to be excellent and the whole thing an engaging, surprising, sad urban love story that was beautifully told.  I'm delighted I gave it a chance, and days later I find I'm still thinking about it.",1384992000,3,591,4.87
5789031,1,B00DCHWTES,"I usually enjoy a foreign flick, but this one was just plain irritating to sit through. One of the main characters is so annoying to watch, it actually ruins the film. He just comes across as gross (the blonde). Otherwise the story was mediocre, although this one is more about character development than storyline. I found it to be lacking.",1384560000,,341,4.7
5789032,5,B00DCHWTES,"Great movie. Did watch twice on a rental. Really well done movie. Believable story. If you're a queer American with an aversion to reading foreign films,---start reading foreign films! They're worth the time and effort. You're exposed to new languages, new fresh ideas, more life. After reading along with 1,2 or 3 foreign language movies, it becomes an unconscious process. You'll get accustom to it.",1384560000,,401,5.184615384615385
5789033,4,B00DCHWTES,not the best movie i have every watched but i think it was worth the4 $ to rent it- i am glad that i didn't buy it though.,1383004800,,122,3.392857142857143
5789034,4,B00DCHWTES,"I must disagree with the individual who gave this film one star and said it was simply another film about problematic gay men.
Yes the men are gay, but more than that they are flawed, ordinary people who made poor choices, most probably due to their age and circumstance.

I can only hope the film will help the rest of the ordinary flawed humans who, mostly because of youth and environment, run around living life externally without connecting to their inner source of strength.
Everyone has been young and foolish at some point in their life, if you are lucky enough to survive your ""follies of youth"" period, you eventually gain a true understanding of what e=mc squared means.
A film like this is important because it reveals how one bad choice can screw up your life; some place somewhere, someone viewing this film will experience an epiphany and will rethink a poor choice that before seeing this film they were committed to. I speak from experience; for me Midnight Express was the film that allowed me to ""see the error of my ways.""

Both lead actors gave very fine performances and the film definitely holds ones attention. Yes, it's sad and rather tragic, but it is actually a gentle depiction of a very harsh lesson.
It is an important film about being human... gay has very little to do with the overall subject matter.",1380844800,7,1333,4.6680851063829785
5789035,1,B00DCHWTES,"I thought this was going to be a simple beautiful love story, but it turns into...closeted boy meets boy, boy gets into trouble and goes to jail, other boy starts having sex with someone else because he can't wait....blah,blah.  Yet another movie showing how gay men don't understand the concept of waiting for true love.  I'm tired of self impose tragedy.",1380499200,4,356,4.819672131147541
5789036,5,B00DCHWTES,"Paulo is an aspiring pianist who is living with his long suffering girlfriend Anka. He has a penchant for being a bit bi- curious and his contretemps are starting to wear thin. Then one night he has `one too many' at a bar and the rather accommodating barman takes him home. This is gay Albanian bass playing Ilir (Guillaume Gouix `The Returned' TV series). Nothing happens but the following day it is clear that there is a spark between the two men.  So they decide to meet again - just for a drink etc.

Well one thing leads to another and before you can say `my place or yours' they are at it like sex starved teens. Then Paulo has to return home and is called out by Anka, he tries denying it but eventually she has had enough and asks him to get out. He has nowhere to go so goes back to Ilir, who is not keen at first but gives in and lets him stay. They soon become emotionally embedded with each other despite the cultural differences. This includes visiting a rather well stocked sex shop.

Then Ilir has to go away for a few days but they have now decided that they are in love and are made for each other. Paulo waits eagerly for the return and nothing happens. What does happen though will be a test of their bond and of their actual self awareness and feelings for each other.

This makes for an utterly absorbing film. Whilst dealing with gay issues it is more about relationships and how we find our way in the world. I was captivated almost from the beginning and was pulled in by the on screen chemistry that the two manage to bring. There is hardly any bedroom stuff either, but that is not a problem for me. It is well acted, brilliantly directed and made with bags of love. It is in both French and Albanian with really good sub titles. This is a film that deserves a lot more attention and I can only recommend.",1379030400,11,1832,4.255747126436781
5789037,4,B00DCHWTES,"Paulo (Matila Malliarakis) is a somewhat nave young man, living with a girlfriend with whom he has a mostly platonic relationship.  One night, he goes out drinking with friends, and overdoes it, but not before he is noticed by the hunky bartender, Ilir (Guillaume Gouix), who takes him to his place to sleep it off.  Ilir stirs some feelings in Paulo that he is not yet comfortable about, but the older man is patient and lets their chemistry develop slowly.  Eventually, Paulo's girlfriend gets wind of what is happening, and throws him out, at which point Ilir - who prefers to keep his options open - reluctantly agrees to take him in.  Their relationship grows into love, until Ilir has to travel with a band he is in, leaving the codependent Paulo waiting anxiously for his return.  Unfortunately, situations develop that could keep them apart forever, and Paulo must consider other options, which could result in a drastic change in his life.

I commend the screenwriter and director for providing realistic/gritty characters with no shortage of personal baggage, yet who seem to be on a path to making a relationship work. The two leads give an outstanding performance in their roles, and the emotional melodrama seems fairly real.  Definitely not a ""feel good"" movie, and it does get into somewhat dark sexual situations, though no nudity (Not rated, would be a heavy R due to content).  In French with English sub-titles.  DVD has no extras other than trailer.  I give it four stars out of five.",1378425600,10,1504,4.83984375
5789058,4,B00DCHWTES,"BB: Beyond the Walls features some impressive talent, especially that of Matila Mailliarakis, who depicts, with piercing accuracy, the pathos of unrequited love.

Paulo, who is living with a woman, fails to make it home one night after getting drunk in a bar. Ilir, a guitarist who played in the bar that night, sees Paulo's compromised condition and takes him back to his house for the night.  In helping Paulo sober up, conversation goes no further than Ilirs  rhetorical question to the much younger Paulo. So you're still trying to figure it out, eh?  Ilirs act of mercy comes without obvious strings attached, but to Paulo it signifies something much deeper.

When Paulo returns to the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, distracted and hung over, he offers little in the way of excuses for his overnight absence, and promptly heads back out. By no coincidence he bumps into Ilir who has just finished a performance with his band.  Paulo somehow winds up helping Ilirs band stow their equipment after the show, unaware that his girlfriend has caught sight of him.  As she watches a giddy and effeminate Paulo from her hiding spot, the disgust on her face portends the inevitable. No longer able to tolerate Paulos duplicity and longstanding lack of physical affection, she kicks him out of their flat.

As a dejected Paulo heads into the night, toting a bag of belongings, he arrives at his destination.  Ilir, surprised, allows Paulo to stay the night, albeit reluctantly, and by morning his exhaustion from Paulos presence is palpable. At one point Paulo, a child-like, young man, asks Ilir, Will you take care of me?  Thus begins an emotional push-and-pull between the older, more serious, Ilir and the playful Paulo, who seems to be winning Ilir over with his juvenile, if annoying, distractions.

It is not clear whether the rough and edgy Ilir is gay or straight, or just pretending to be one or the other for the sake of something not yet clear. Meanwhile, Paulos allegiance to his own gender now seems irrefutable, based on the emotional furor that erupts when Ilir later leaves. Or does sexual orientation have anything to do with it all? As Paulos agitation increases, aspects of Ilirs character hurl to the surface, giving way to more questions. An absorbing character study from start to finish, Beyond the Walls may not satisfy audiences who like decisive endings in movies.
For those who believe human nature to be unpredictable, often inexplicable, and never perfect, Beyond the Walls will make perfect sense.",1467504000,,2534,4.938823529411764

5789060,4,B00DCHWTES,"Overall a good film, but did anyone catch the line when the two are at the swank hotel that Ilir admitted he had syphilis? He revealed that after he tried to make love with Paolo. This doesn't seem like the action of a person who truly loves another.",1463097600,,250,4.229166666666667

5789062,5,B00DCHWTES,I heard about this move for some time and just decide to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. This the story of two men who fall for each other in what seems to be their first relationship with another man. It is at times romantic and touching but also their relationship is unhealthy and the two are very codependent. This film does a good job of showing what can happen when one loses themselves in another. The good and the bad.,1450656000,,425,4.325

5789067,4,B00DCHWTES,"Beyond the Walls is a very sexy and ultimately very sad movie, as it explores the stages of a love gone wrong.  The sexiness is not from shots of lovemaking but of playful intimacy, which was very believable and very touching.  You care about these two and you get to know them well.  It's a well-made story that is gay but only incidentally.",1401494400,,342,4.396825396825397
5789068,1,B00DCHWTES,Not a good quality film. Not worth the rental price. Acting is so so and story line is flimsy. A dud!,1395446400,,101,3.857142857142857
5789069,4,B00DCHWTES,I've seen in ages. The leads are both hot and good actors. Didn't quite get the ending I was hoping for but still a great movie.,1393804800,,128,3.9615384615384617
5789070,4,B00DCHWTES,"The story line depicting the rise and fall of a relationship was quite good.  Like many European gay-themed movies, I found it on the depressing side.  Also, the movie is very darkly filmed although that may be the director's intent the convey the dark mood of the story.",1393200000,,271,4.625

Ilir goes on a weekend trip and when Paulo finds where he is there is nothing but heartache and turmoil. I won't say more, don't want to spoil it. Both leads were spectacular actors as well as very attractive, which doesn't hurt. It is in French with English sub-titles which I don't mind, there is no other option. Loved it, loved it, loved it.",1392422400,2,546,4.362745098039215
5789072,4,B00DCHWTES,"I could not wipe the smile from my face at the start of this movie because there was a lot of metaphorical falling going on. From the first time the two central characters meet, they fall drunkenly into bed (no sex, though). They fall into a sexually tense, but chaste, friendship. Next, they fall into a sexually passionate friendship. Then, they fall into a tense, uncomfortalbe living arrangement. Soon, they fall in love in a delightfully blissful manner.

Just as the couple's lives are going great, the defecation hit the oscillator. Through a series of events, both characters free-fall into an emotional, downward spiral of psychological and physical pain beyond anything I could have guessed or imagined. The beautiful, male, Albanian character is imprisoned, beaten, facially scarred, and spiritually broken. The beautiful, male, French character is abandoned and lost. Out of economic necessity he accepts the attention and affection of an older, wealthier French man who helps the VERY young man (code for twink) to explore his interest in very rough sex.  What? Monsieur Le Twink quickly becomes Monsieur Le Masochiste? Ohhhhhkaaayy.

I've never seen a French film with an upbeat ending, and this film follows that pattern of downbeat conclusions. Both fellows move sadly into the next phases of their lives, and while both grieve for what they have lost, they both seem committed to moving on with their lives, albeit in completely opposite directions.",1392336000,5,1466,5.203389830508475
5789073,5,B00DCHWTES,"Beyond the Walls is the brilliant, beautiful, erotic and powerful story of an almost pathologically needy young man named Paulo, his encounters with two much stronger men, and how those experiences change his life.

There are none of the stereotypical characters, florid melodrama and boringly predictable plot clich&eacute;s that cripple most gay movies. From their initial meeting in a bar, Paulo and Ilir jump quickly into a relationship of such intense passion and tenderness that it makes all other gay movies look like The Love Boat. But from that point on, nothing anybody does fits our Hollywood-conditioned expectations of what these characters ought to do. They all change, but never in ways we expect them to.

The movie is never either predictable or gimmicky, and every scene rings true. Best of all is Matila Malliarakis's astonishing, courageous and brilliant performance as Paulo. Everything about this movie is excellent - the writing, direction, photography, music, and all the actors - but without Malliarakis it would be just a good movie. He makes it spectacular.",1391990400,5,1084,5.2601156069364166
5789074,5,B00DCHWTES,"I watched it 4 days ago and it's still on my mind. A movie that carries well the power and heartbreak of relationship always seems to move me. Skillfully directed, well acted, earthy, and real where the tire hits the road. Offers a slice of life for all of us to contemplate.",1390521600,3,275,4.3076923076923075
5789075,4,B00DCHWTES,"I tend to like tragedies and smoldering melodrama and this film has it in spades. Character motivations and actions are puzzling at times, mostly by editing and story telling trajectory. The time that passes is not always easy to gauge. The movie is quiet and slow, but complex. There was something here for me. If you find the plot synopsis of this film interesting and you can handle melancholy and drama, this is for you.
I wouldn't find life lessons here. I took from this an interesting story of paths crossing. One in evolution the other devolution. Those lines zig-zag their way along towards avoidable yet irreconcilable courses. I loved Guillaume Gouix as Imir and found the actor's performance complex and the character charming yet tragically flawed. Matila Malliarakis is fine as Paulo, who is a lost needy soul, Dependent on others, his evolution is colored by the bird whose wing he takes comfort from.",1389571200,,916,4.916129032258064

8591838,3,B00DCHWTES,"Good story of two men who find themselves falling fast into some type of relationship and then having it all end abruptly. Paulo is in a relationship with a woman, although troubled and not in love he stays with her. After a night out drinking he passes out and is taken home by the bartender good looking Ilir  Paulo is quickly drawn to the stronger Ilir and after eventually leaving his partner Paulo ends up on the doorstep of Ilir with nowhere else to turn. The two start a living arrangement and Paulo becomes very much attached to his new roommate.  After having had to leave town for a concert Paulo finds himself wondering where Ilir went of too.

This is where the story starts to unfold as two men on two very different paths having met and tried to make something together and now find themselves apart again.  I really liked this story as it shows how the much stronger Ilir and the more nimble Paulo almost switch places toward the end of the movie and where they end up heading.  I also liked the very brief introduction of Paulo's new man, how they met which was up front none the less and how he provided him with the backbone to face his fears.

Nice movie with two good leading men, raw with emotion and good ending for all.",1473120000,,1242,4.378260869565217
