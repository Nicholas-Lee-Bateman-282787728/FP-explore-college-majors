8212325,5,6301598954,"This is a film I fondly remember from my childhood days along with Battles of Chief Pontiac, the Little Big Horn and the Big Sky.  It's unfortunate that none of the major movie studios have taken the time to produce a remastered/unedited DVD on any of these films except for Chief Pontiac (if I'm mistaken about this, let me know).  This is one of the reasons I keep my VHS player in working order.

Dane Andrews, Andy Devine and a young Raymond Burr do well with the simple plot along with the ""gun runner"" John Carradine.  It's an easy 70 minutes or so and you'll find yourself coming back to it often.",1355961600,,604,4.366071428571429
8212326,3,6301598954,"THUNDER PASS is a typical, run-of-the-mill Western that certainly won't kill you to watch it.

As a child, I was enchanted -- and still am! -- by the film's captivating march-like theme, played whenever the settlors and cavalry could be seen trudging through the desert to escape from Injuns on the warpath. If you're as sensitively attuned to film score music as I am, you absolutely must get ahold of THUNDER PASS, if, for nothing else, than to hear for yourself these haunting strains.

Unfortunately, the music must have been pilfered from other films, for no mention of the composer(s) is provided; although Edward J. Kay is credited as its musical director.",1303776000,2,663,4.910714285714286
