8586858,4,B00CVV0D8U,"Another good thurderbean collection. But the short entitled ""The Quail Hunt"" is downright unwatchable due to the audio being out of sync by 5-10 seconds. Buy the collection, but be wary that it has one less short.",1499817600,,213,4.783783783783784
8586859,4,B00CVV0D8U,"A great disc for anyone who loves old cartoons...especially Oswald.  It has a historic gallery in it that shows some rare promo posters of Oswald cartoons that have been lost that are very interesting along with some other historical facts.  The presentation of everything is fairly well done.  The only reason I did not go 5 stars, is that after each cartoon played, it went back to the menu list again, instead of just playing though every cartoon.  I found that a bit annoying, but overall a small issue.  I recommend this disc...",1460246400,,533,4.688172043010753

8586862,5,B00CVV0D8U,"I have liked Woody and Walter Lantz since I was seven. So much happened around the man that he ties into the golden age of cartunes more intricately than most. As a pioneer and innovator he has done it all, including many firsts. This Collection along with the two Woody Woodpecker and Friends collections will provide a very good compilation of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Though it contains 'The Ocean Hop' directed by Walt Disney, it has a Walt Lantz sound track. I would like to have seen a small sampling of Disney's work for contrast, if there is any.  At times I think I detect 'Tex' Avery's influence. The only thing better than this would be a complete collection of all of the Oswald cartunes that still exist with a detailed documentary of all the great cartoonists who gave him life.",1390780800,2,792,4.577464788732394
8586863,4,B00CVV0D8U,"The wild precursor to Mickey Mouse gets ground through the VanBeuren prism of animation in this collection, but it's a must-have for the rubber hose animation fans.  When Universal handed things over to Lantz, the storylines rambled, the continuity evaporated, and the voices changed from film to film.  But there is an odd energy that still survives, and some truly jaw-dropping non-PC imagry.  Steven Stanchfield has done an amazing job of tracking down the best print versions of these titles I have ever seen.",1377561600,3,513,5.083333333333333
8586864,5,B00CVV0D8U,"If you have clicked the link to look at this dvd you should just buy it now.  Thunderbean always does a excelent job of presenting classic cartoons that you have wanted to see your whole life in the highest quality.  This set has a nice taste of many of the Lantz shorts.  some of them not easy to find.  non of them have ever looked this good.  But what I love about the set is that the shorts look clean but still look old .  I don't care for the trend of brighting the colors to a level that looks unnatural for the time they were made.

If you like classic animation I think you will like this set.",1376870400,11,602,4.008403361344538
8586865,5,B00CVV0D8U,"Steve Stanchfield of Thunderbean Animation does it again. Steve has produced in past few years many wonderful animation collections that feature rare, hard to find, lost even obscure material when it comes to animation history. Lots of Steve is hard work to save animation history is almost second to none, but unfortunately it flies under the radar. While I think Steve and his Thunderbean staff deserve more recognition for their hard work. Compared to Thunderbeans is earlier DVD's products this set is no expectation. It is filled with tons of material, this time around focusing on early years of Walter Lantz, both when he was still employee at Bray Studio (defunt silent animation power house) as well as Lantz early years at his own studio, this set features both cartoons that  feature Oswald the Lucky Rabbit after Lantz in hearted the character, as well as other one-shot cartoons the 1930's, the set is also have many fine extras and bonuses. The only down side to this set far as i'm concerned its only a single disc, as I could spend lot of time on Walter Lantz animation specially if they are handled with care like Steve has done on this set. In other words this set is higly recomended for serious animation collectors, while casual soccer moms should probably look elswhere.",1372377600,9,1292,4.846153846153846
8586866,5,B00CVV0D8U,"A stellar collection of hard-to-find (and often hard-to-watch) cartoons from Walter Lantz's underrated studio, meticulously restored to the best of animation archaeologist Steve Stanchfield's ability. As a lifelong researcher of the Lantz studio (I cofounded the Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia website), there's material here that even I have never seen before. This stuff is as RARE as it gets! Buy it without hesitation!",1371772800,22,425,5.761904761904762
8586867,5,B00CVV0D8U,"I just got this set, and I thought it was awesome! The transfers were great, and all the Oswald shorts had pristine transfers, and all had very realistic original titles. The only cartoon that didn't have any original titles was Boy Meets Dog, but the transfer was very pristine, and was very eye-popping great! Some of these Oswald transfers were even as good as the cartoons from the Disney Treasure sets! It might be PD, but the transfers were great as ""official set"" quality. For example, ""The Beachcombers"" was a much better transfer from this Thunderbean set than a transfer used before (also from Thunderbean) which wasn't that great, or wasn't restored like this transfer. Highly recommended!",1371168000,16,700,4.9914529914529915
