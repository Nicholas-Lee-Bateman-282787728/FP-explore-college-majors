8009295,3,B0001AF4K0,"I remember as a kid of maybe 8 or 9, being home sick from school and watching 'The Gong Show' (among other gameshows) and my favorite part (with the exception of Gene Gene the Dancing Machine), if he made an appearance in that particular episode, was the Unknown Comic, aka Murray Langston. Watching his routines some 3+ decades later, I can see why the man appealed to my prepubescent sense of humor - bad puns, scatology, manic energy, a bag on his head - but now...not so much, I'm sorry to say.

This 1982 special, originally produced for Playboy TV, is obviously a little more risque than the Comic's 'Gong Show' stuff, with 4-letter words, scantily-clad babes (including Connie Downing, Lori Sutton and Lou Mulford) and drug humor, but still very much in keeping with his overall sense of humor. The short skits are interspersed with excerpts from Langston's stand-up act, recorded on board the Comedy Boat of Tucson, AZ (now long since defunct - just try finding any information on it).

The highlight of the tape, though, as it turns out are the juggling routines of James Wilder (of 'Melrose Place' and 'Models, Inc.' fame), billed here as James Marcel for some reason. They're a lot more fun than Langston's stuff - funnier, too. Flaming torches, bowling balls, sickles, machetes, meat cleavers and running electric chainsaws, Wilder does it all. Who knew he had this kind of talent?",1365552000,,1393,4.824267782426778
