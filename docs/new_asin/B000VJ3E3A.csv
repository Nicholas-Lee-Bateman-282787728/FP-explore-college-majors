The guys that were there  fighting  the other guy and both of them re-visiting the battlegrounds together is a personal  punch in the stomach  for those watching and  know what  this is all about. Were you there?  Perhaps  you knew of someone that did not come home. Or  was wounded. The triup on the bikes  over tough terrain with  beautiful camera  work makes you feel you are right there with them,  And there are some out-takes that were used anyway. A  sensational Idea for this story and film.  You wil not forget it.",1411689600,,538,4.505263157894737
8219003,2,B000VJ3E3A,"I did not like this documentary - far, far too heavy on efforts to hype the dialogue and emotions, not enough on actually touring the country and seeing eg. Pleiku, DaNang, Hue, Nha Trang, and Saigon before and after. I was, however, taken aback at the very beginning - seeing a modern Boeing 737 utilized by a Vietnamese airline.",1359676800,,330,4.610169491525424
8219004,5,B000VJ3E3A,"this is a very inspiring movie of healing, mind and body, after the traumas of the Vietnam war for both Americans and Vietnamese.  I highly recommend it to people interested in the era or in overcoming disabilities.",1347408000,,215,4.8108108108108105
8219005,5,B000VJ3E3A,"A great watch - as a bicyclist myself, at the age of 73, I found it more than just a bicycle ride from North to South of Vietnam which in itself would have made it a worthwhile watch but the interface between the American cyclists and the Vietnamese people including North Vietnamese military veterans - the enemy during the War - and also the emotional and healing aspects for many of the participants, was powerful and meaningful.",1278720000,,432,4.623376623376624
8219006,4,B000VJ3E3A,"As a first-generation Vietnamese American I've long struggled with understanding the costs of the Vietnam War.  This video shows the reconciliation between American vets and North Vietnamese citizens as they cycle along a path that brings back bad memories.  The cinematography is great, showing aspects to Vietnamese life I'd only heard about through my mom.  The filmmakers focus on the experience of the vets, though there are marathon cyclists and other civilians in the tour.  The vets relate their tour of duty, their tears and their PTSD to the audience.  The longstanding pain they carry is palpable.

Long story short, everyone has a sort of epiphany with the trip and the trip proves to be therapeutic to the vets.

The fun part is watching the deleted scenes that show tension between the American and Vietnamese cycling groups.  The whole time I was watching the video, I was wondering, geez this story seems almost too perfect, too free from conflicts.  You find more in the deleted scenes.  The vets chafe at attending certain sites like the My Lai memorial and choose to stand outside, stating that they don't want to be puppetted by the government.  In the deleted scenes the vets go into more detail of how the bicycle tour got rerouted and channeled through many, many memorials, like rubbing salt in with a forced mea culpa.

I would suggest renting or borrowing this video, as opposed to buying it...it doesn't have much for repeat viewing value.",1247184000,4,1466,4.914634146341464
