8168729,5,B000MGBSF8,Great movie. Lots of jokes. A lot of funny 1 liners and a lot of great funny scenes.  Really pleased with my purchase and the time I took to watch the movie. Not disappointed at all.,1387324800,,182,4.055555555555555
8168730,4,B000MGBSF8,"Okay, let's be honest, we all know these aren't Chris Rock's greatest movies, yeah, that is obvious. However, they both are funny movies starring the hilarious Chris Rock, two on one disc and for cheap, so I grabbed it, and think you should too.",1363132800,,245,4.590909090909091
8168731,5,B000MGBSF8,"Down to earth and Head of state are similar in comedies in the fact that Chris Rock is a hilarious person.  His slapstick-like comedy will definately have you laughing.  Some parts are serious, but most of them are incredibly funny.  I would rate these 2 movies as the funniest movies that I've ever seen.  Well worth the price both movies are going for.  Don't miss out on these if you haven't seen them.  Down to earth is probably the way funnier movie of the two.  I can't stop laughing at it, if you've never seen it you have to.",1287705600,,533,4.3232323232323235
8168732,4,B000MGBSF8,"Chris Rock is funny in each of these movies and never fails to poke fun at any stupidity regardless of race. In light of Obama's election to president, Head of State seems even funnier this time around.",1236038400,,202,4.486486486486487
8168733,5,B000MGBSF8,"Love Chris Rock but Bernie Mac made the movie for me.

Great cast.",1235260800,,66,4.076923076923077
