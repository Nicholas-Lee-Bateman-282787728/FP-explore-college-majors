8494211,3,630141005X,"Horror vhs collectors will go crazy for this tape. The very idea is an 80's videovore metalhead's dream come true. The title, coverart, and bands included all scream incredible. Genre fans will surely recognize the Dickies as the main theme music maestros from Killer Klowns. These things being said, any well versed video collector will groan when they discover this was released by Simitar Video and has the weight of a feather, 2 signs of fear for video fans. It is recorded in SLP mode so a VCR that is even remotely picky will not play this in any enjoyable capacity. My number one gripe is the quality of sound of the songs played throughout. They sound terrible, all fuzzy and distorted, sounding like they are blowing the speakers when played at normal volume. Just terribly distracting overall, but the songs themselves are mostly rad songs, just ruined by cheap video producers. The movie clips shown are amazing, of course you get all the public domain goodies, but there are some oddities thrown in. Let's not forget the awesome narrator. With keyboard voice effects so thick he sounds like the narrator from Faces of Death met the narrator from the Slaughterhouse trailer and had a demonic baby.
Bound to be a rare tape in the near future, get it on the cheap if you can. I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for it, unless you are a completest. The quality is not there, but the collectibilty is and it looks nice on the shelf.",1403308800,,1438,4.665354330708661
