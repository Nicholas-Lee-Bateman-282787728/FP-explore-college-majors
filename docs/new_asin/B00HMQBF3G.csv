8633572,3,B00HMQBF3G,"Shinobi Girl is the perfect venue to shut off your mind and watch what can only be a college class episodic film. The plot line is as follows: Noriko is a secretary for a wallstreet CEO. Wallstreet CEO are all very horny and like to rape their secretaries, so Noriko does the only sensible thing a secretary would do. SHE BECOMES A NINJA!! Now as the sexy Shinobi Girl, she protects other secretaries from grabby CEOs. The budget is pretty small, the fights are semi competent and the dialog is attrocious. Every cliche is in here. On the plus side, Shinobi Girl and her main antagonist AKA the other hot chick, are both easy on the eyes and the whole thing is enjoyable enough.

Paid about $10 for the whole series and I'm happy with it. Oh and there is no nudity or extreme violence or raping. So it's not a full eploitation movie either.",1421798400,9,840,4.419354838709677
