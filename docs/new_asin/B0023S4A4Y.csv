8551547,5,B0023S4A4Y,a very good series underrated in my opinion if you like pulp fiction or resevior dogs ( sorry for the misspelling ) you should like this as well,1447286400,,144,4.178571428571429
8551548,4,B0023S4A4Y,"As I stated before on Volume Three, this is quality anime. Oh, a bit violent, so not a show for children. And it would be too confusing for them as well. So if you are looking for a different kind of anime, then this show is it.",1302134400,,228,3.872340425531915
