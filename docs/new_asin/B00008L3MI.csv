1850153,5,B00008L3MI,"The person from Pepper Mill or whatever spoke as though this was the end of show. Actually they're wrong. In Japan there was another season after this entitled Sailor Stars and the first 6 episodes were devoted to wrapping up the SuperS season and then moved on to a new arc involving Sailor Galaxia and the Sailor Wars. However, this will probably not be licensed in the USA anytime soon due to censorship issues but we can only hope right? Anyway, this disc was really good. I recommend the entire 5 season run to any anime fan. Don't forget the 3 movies! (R, S, SuperS) which are just as good!",1059436800,4,596,4.427272727272728
1850154,5,B00008L3MI,In this DVD the Sailor Warriors fight against the dark moon kingdom. Nephialina finds the holder of pegusas which is Chibiusa. Chibiusa gets into a deep sleep. Usagi must find away to protect Chibiusa. This DVD contains 3 uncut episoaes. Oh yeah if you want to see Sailor Stars I reccomend going to ebay thats where i got the 5th season. I have alomsot all the episodes on DVD and Video. So if you want Sailor Stars and all the episodes i would go to ebay. This DVD is the best one in the season.,1058659200,,496,4.231578947368421
1850155,5,B00008L3MI,"Some people don't like the Sailor Moon Super S season because there is too much focus around Chibi-Usa (Rini). This is why, after the first few episodes of Sailor Moon Sailor Stars,
she is gone, no more, back to the future. That's right, the only other time she appears is a cameo appearence towards the end. So if you think about it, they aren't showing too much
of her, they're just making up for the lack or air time in the fifth and final season of Sailor Moon.
Other then what I just said, get the DVD. It is worth the cost, trust me.",1054598400,3,539,4.1923076923076925
1850156,5,B00008L3MI,"It may be short, but it follows the gang to the end of the season as everything is finally uncovered. Hope to see more of the Amazoness Quartet in the next season. The last episode was much like a sailor moon movie and well ended.",1054339200,,230,4.133333333333334
1850157,5,B00008L3MI,"I just finished watching the last of the Pegasus Collection. I have to say I was most impressed as to how they left the end of the series. If I wasn't a big Sailor Moon fan I would have thought that was the end of the show all together, but I'm not so I look forword to the Stars even if it isn't dubbed, good work guys!",1053043200,5,320,3.791044776119403
1850158,5,B00008L3MI,"This disc marks the end of the American DVD releases of S and SuperS. This disc will include Sailormoon SuperS episodes:
 (164) The Golden Crystal Comes Out! Neherenia's Spell!
 (165) When the Crystal Shines! The Power of Beautiful Dreams!
 (166) Forever Dreams! Light Throughout the Sky!
This disc is the end of the Dead Moon Circus story line, but not the end of it's main villainess, Queen Neherenia (see Sailorstars episodes 167-172).
Many people feel that Sailormoon SuperS is the worst season of Sailormoon due to it's focus on Chibiusa. However, there are many amazing elements shown throughout this season. This final disc contains one of the most spectacular season wrap-ups in Sailormoon history. Neherenia is absolutely one of the best villainesses of this series.
I recommend Sailormoon SuperS Pegasus Collection volume VII to Sailormoon fans everywhere; though, beware. Pioneer's translation is a little strange in the subtitles.
This disc also includes the Cloverway dub of these episodes.
Support Sailormoon and buy the DVDs!",1050278400,8,1040,5.329268292682927
1850159,5,B00008L3MI,"I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time. It brings the last 3 episodes. This DVD should bring SuperS #37:The Golden Crystal Comes Out! Neherenia's Spell, SuperS #38:When the Crystal Shines! The Power Of Beautiful Dreams, SuperS #39: Forever Dreams! Light Throughout the Sky... if u guys like SuperS you should see Sailor Stars its the last saga of SailorMoon and guess who comes back Neherenia and the outerscout plus three new scout the Sailor Stars and chibi chibi...i hope they bring SailorStars in DVD very soon",1045958400,10,522,4.876404494382022
1850180,5,B00008L3MI,"Sailor Moon is one of my all time favorite anime's all though, Sailor Stars was never dubbed in English. So if you don't watch Sailor Stars, this would be ending of the series for you.",1390953600,,184,4.285714285714286
1850181,5,B00008L3MI,"Here we are at the end of season 4, & it's been a really fun ride for the most part.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from WikiMoon.

164.  The Golden Crystal appears!  Nehellenia's Spell:  Queen Nehellenia forces Helios to return to his body and give up the Golden Crystal, allowing the evil queen to break free from her mirror.  A

165.  Time For the Crystal To Shine!  The Beautiful Power of Dreams:  Queen Nehellenia, free from her mirror at last, prepares to use the power of the Golden Crystal.  A

166.  Dreams Forever!  Light Throughout The Sky:  Queen Nehellenia makes a desperate last stand as the Golden Crystal destroys the Dead Moon Circus.  A+

And now it's time for the final analysis.  I have to admit, Nehellenia's backstory was much better in the anime.  In the manga, Nehellenia was a rip-off of Maleficent, while in the anime she was like a twisted version of the evil queen in Snow White (she had a magic mirror and was obsessed with being beautiful).  The origin of the Dead Moon Circus is one of the most interesting & disturbing things I've seen in an animated series.  Zirconia also had her relationship explained better, while in the manga it seemed she came out of nowhere; & no matter how many times I read it she just seems to disappear without a trace (cue the X-Files theme) while in the anime she at least got a decent exit.  Despite this, I prefer the later part of the manga for 3 reasons.

1.  The Outer Senshi return.  As much as I dislike Uranus & Neptune, Pluto & Saturn are awesome & they were all used better and kicked more butt there than in the next season.

2.  The Amazoness Quartet turn out to be Sailor Senshi.  They were the only villains of this season I liked better in the manga.  Seriously, who decided to rob them of their heritage?

3.  More focus on Mamoru.  The Golden Crystal belonged to him, and at the end he & Sailor Moon blew away Queen Nehellenia.  That was a much better finale, and is what really makes prefer the manga.

But despite all this, SuperS is still a great season overall.  It was worth it just for the part with the Amazon Trio (I like to pretend that after a few episodes with them the Quartet showed up, revealed the truth about them & turned them into werebeasts, leading to the events in the manga where they targeted the Sailor Senshi).  Sadly, it would be the last time anything good came out of the anime, apart from the SuperS movie.  That's right; I'm one of the 6 people who don't like the Sailor Stars anime.  But I'll discuss why next time, when the series officially jumps the shark.",1383177600,,2589,4.418259023354564
1850182,5,B00008L3MI,So how can you give a low rating on a sailor moon dvd?? I'm very satisfied and sad because it was the ending of the Super S series. No scratches or damage to the case or disc,1376784000,,174,3.72972972972973

1850184,5,B00008L3MI,"The disk arrived in excellent condition AND mine came with a tiny mini poster. The cover artwork is nice. But boy was the shipping slow- I ordered it from the UK. Anyway, great show, nice characters, classic and I love Helios!

1850208,5,B00008L3MI,"Sailor Moon SuperS is by far the best series of Sailor Moon in AMERICA, and the Pegasus Collection 7 is absolutely wonderful. The animation is wonderful and the music will make you cry it is so beautiful. Plus the relationship between Helios and Chibi-Usa is absolutely wonderful. This is absolutely a must have!

To clear a few things up.... the Stars season has been released in Japan, but it will not be released in the U.S. on account of it's too violent. Pioneer, DIC, and others refuse to dub in because it is impossible to edit without losing major chunks of the story.",1105574400,9,576,4.592233009708738
1850209,4,B00008L3MI,"As all of you Sailor Moon Fans know, this is not the end to the Sailor Moon story.. As a matter of fact, I have the Sailor Moon Stars DVD!! Complete and uncut, in Japanese and in subtitles. So all you moonie fans want to inquire in obtaining this valuable collectible, simply go onto Ebay and search for Sailor Moon Stars DVD....it is entitled ""Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon - Sailor Stars DVD Season 5 New Uncut"". There is always someone on Ebay selling this popular item, so Good Luck!!!!!",1102032000,3,488,4.49438202247191
1850210,4,B00008L3MI,"This is an excellent DVD.  Finally SuperS gets away from the slower pace found earlier in the season and has a major boost of action and events.  Although the story seems to come to a close, there is more.  The tale of Nehelenia has SIX more episodes after this one.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing this review it seems unlikely that those six episodes will ever be released in the United States any time soom

The six episodes that follow this dvd mentioned  above have Sailor Neptune, Uranus, Pluto and yes even Saturn join in for the final battle against Nehelenia who has been a given new power.

Still, considering that we're given only part of the ending here, the end of SuperS gives enough closure to the story to be satisfying.  This dvd shows why SuperS is a good series, even if it is so dramatically different from the rest of Sailor Moon.",1094947200,4,858,4.490322580645161
1850211,5,B00008L3MI,"While I'm not a big fan of the 4th season of Sailor Moon in general, I have to say that it is one of my favorite finales to a season.  It is a little darker in the tone of the final episodes, and even the actual ending isn't as ""all's well that end's well"" as the other seasons' finales.  (although in the japanese version of the 1st season, the scouts all die, so I guess you can't get any darker than that...but they all just magically are reborn into the exact same time they left, so that makes it kinda cheap).  This is also the beginning of the dragging out of the endings.  The first season (uncut) spanned 2 episodes, the 2nd season, 3.  This one is almost 4 1/2 (starting at the end of Collection 6).  But for those of you who are going to see the Stars season, be warned.  The finale covers almost the last 8 episodes!  The music throughout the 4th season is excellent, as well...quite in keeping with the wonderful score of the 3rd season.

The fact that the DVD only has 3 episodes doesn't bother me too much.  After all, the price is dropped accordingly.  What is a bummer is the lack of extras on this (and basically every other Sailor Moon) DVD.  While some have production sketches, or little biographies of the Scouts, I find all the DVDs lacking in the extras department.  Maybe a bio on Sailor Moon in general, interviews with the voice actors, etc.

If you are reading this, you are probably a Sailor Moon fan and are going to buy this DVD anyway.  But if you need a recommendation, I would give it for this (and Collection 6) very freely!  The SuperS season may start off slowly, but it finishes with a bang!",1090195200,,1629,4.309210526315789
1850212,5,B00008L3MI,"Wow! I was very impressed, especially with the action, unlike the rest of the super s series. I have most of the other ones and it's not as intreading.  It's the same old ""find-the-mirror-pegasus-is-in,"" and it gets really boring after a while.  This is where the climax of the season is at its highest.  If you have seen this series on tv and plan on buying it, get only THIS DVD, but one piece of advice: watch it in JAPANESE with subtitles.  You'll appreciate sailor moon even more and find that the english version is incredibly corny.  Beyond that, I recommend this DVD very much.",1088899200,2,585,4.533333333333333
1850213,4,B00008L3MI,"Yes, i must admit that the SuperS series is a bit boring. But the conclusion to the series is very good. I have this DVD and watched it about a million times. Also, you can watch the orginal Japanese version on this DVD.",1074902400,,220,4.1395348837209305
1850214,4,B00008L3MI,"Wow! what an awesome season of SM come to a perfect close! this is an awesome DVD! the only thing is that you have to watch the episodes that the DVD follows up on (unless you're good at guessing, like me!). It begins that Chibi-Moon has been kidnapped by Queen Nehelania and her dream mirror is stolen so Nehelania can finally have Pegasus! The extras on this DVD aren't impressive, but you can watch the episodes in both English and Japanese with subtitles. I prefer Japanese version, but the only flaw is that some of teh lines aren't as funny as they are in English. It's interesting to see how the scripts differ, though. sometimes teh English version put in lines where the Japanese version had no dialogue. Overall, an awesome DVD that is sure to make you sensitive ones cry!",1072051200,3,782,4.553191489361702
1850215,5,B00008L3MI,"Well, not exactly the end, but pretty close to it. SuperS goes straight into StarS but in America, sadly, this is the furthest Sailor Moon has gotten.
I really like the how this was ended. It reminded me of how the movies end. I'm not going to spoil the ending for you but trust me, if you like the SuperS series, this is a must have. There are only three episodes on this DVD but its worth every penny.",1060128000,,403,4.113924050632911

Update:  I got the whole Super S season to watch....HOWEVER compared to the VIZ productions the art-work, screenplay and general story are more old-style TV cartoonish.  This ""Super"" season isn't very super. compared to VIZ season-1, season-R or season-S... I just hope VIZ can spruce it up when and if they redo it.  I hope the ""Crystal"" version  will also be a upgrade compared to this which is just a shadow of the prior 3 VIZ seasons. Hope of the best.",1487894400,,583,4.576923076923077
