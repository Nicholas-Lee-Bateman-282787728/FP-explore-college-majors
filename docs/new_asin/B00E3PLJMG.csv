The Adventures of Andr and Wally B. [1984] This PIXAR animated short involves a character named Andr being awakened in a forest by a pesky bee named Wally B. Andr distracts the bee so that he can run away. Wally B. chases Andr and eventually catches up with him, and strikes with the stinger. A collision occurs off-screen and a dizzy Wally B. reappears with a bent stinger. Shortly, Wally B. gets hit by Andr's tossed hat as a last laugh. Audio Commentary with John Lasseter, Eben Ostby and William Reeves. Running Time: 1:54

Luxo Jr. [1986] Two balanced-arm Anglepoise desk lamps, named Luxo Jr. (small) and Luxo Sr. (large), are playing with a small inflatable rubber ball. When Luxo Jr. tries balancing on it, but the ball eventually deflates due to excessive jumping. As a result, Luxo Jr. is admonished by Luxo Sr., then finds and plays with an even larger ball. Audio Commentary with John Lasseter, Eben Ostby and William Reeves. Running Time: 2:29

Red's Dream [1987] This PIXAR animated film is about a red unicycle named Red, who dreams of becoming the star in a circus act. In his dream, a clown called Lumpy is seen riding Red and juggling. He almost drops one of the balls, but Red bounces it with one of his pedals and gives it back to Lumpy. Lumpy then gets off of Red and continues juggling until he suddenly disappears, at which time Red begins to juggle the balls, and when he finishes, the crowd cheers. He starts to bow, and then soon wakes up, realizing it was just a dream. Sad, Red slowly goes back to the clearance section of the bike store, and he falls back to sleep. Audio Commentary with John Lasseter, Eben Ostby and William Reeves Running Time: 4:09

Tin Toy [1988] A small toy named Tinny tries to escape from Billy, a baby who wants to play with and dribble on him. When Tinny tries to walk, his musical instruments on his back play notes. He then begins to run, but is chased by Billy, who pursues him. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch, and when he looks up, he sees that there are several other toys hiding, also afraid of Billy after learning the same experience. But then while walking and trying to find Tinny and the other toys, Billy falls down on the hardwood floor, but bangs his head, and begins to cry. Tinny, feeling sorry for himself and the baby, tries to go and cheer him up. When he does, Billy manages to cheer up, but then just ignores him and plays with the box Tinny came in. Mad, Tinny tries to follow Billy to get his attention, but is still ignored. Near the end of the credits, other toys hiding under the couch come out from underneath and begin to play. Audio Commentary with John Lasseter, Eben Ostby and William Reeves. Running Time: 5:06

Knick Knack [1989] On a bookshelf filled with summer vacation-themed souvenirs, a snowman named Knick, who is the cousin of Frosty the Snowman, according to the audio commentary, who resides in a snow globe, wants to reach a ""Sunny Miami"" knick knack that shows a girl lounging in a blue bikini. Knick tries several unsuccessful methods to exit the globe: ramming it with the igloo backdrop, using a hammer and his carrot nose to chisel through, attacking it with a jackhammer, using a cutting torch and detonating explosives. As the globe eventually falls over the shelf's edge, Knick notices an emergency exit in the base and frees himself just before knick knack and the globe fall into a fishbowl. Here Knick sees a pretty mermaid souvenir from ""Sunny Atlantis"" and runs toward her, but before he can reach her, the globe settles to the bottom and traps him for the second time, leaving Knick frustrated. Audio Commentary with John Lasseter, Eben Ostby and William Reeves.  Running Time: 3: 47

Geri's Game [1997] An old man named Geri plays a game of chess in the park against himself. He starts off playing as white, but then hoists himself up, and lumbers over to play as the black opponent. He quickly dominates the game as the black side, although he is his own opponent. But just when the game's nearly over, White Geri (the one with the  glasses) fakes a heart attack to outsmart Black Geri (the one with no glasses), and falls to the ground. This alarms Black Geri, and in turn, he tests his own pulse. While he is doing this, White Geri looks up, and flips the board around, inverting the players to their teams. He checkmates Black Geri, and makes him hand over a set of dentures as the prize. The movie ends with him giving a toothy grin, and the camera backs out, revealing that there is only one Geri. Audio Commentary with Jan Pinkava. Running Time: 4:55

For the Birds [2000] Fifteen blue birds land one-by-one on a power line, and soon they encounter a huge and goofy-looking bird. They mimic and tease him, but he goes on the cord anyway. The little birds start pecking on him. They successfully get him off, but when the big bird falls off, the birds are flung away into the sky. When they come back down, we see that they have all lost their feathers, making them the goofy-looking ones now. The short ends with the big bird laughing hysterically as the other birds hide behind him. The first four small birds to land on the power line are named Bully, Chipper, Snob and Neurotic. Audio Commentary with Ralph Eggleston. Running Time: 3:21

Mike's New Car [2002] Mike is obsessed with his new six-wheel drive car, and insists on showing it off to his pal Sulley. Unfortunately for Mike, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Sulley plays with the ultra-adjustable seats until an annoyed Mike asks him to stop. Mike starts the engine and the seatbelt reminder tone sounds. He finds his seatbelt stuck and accidentally locks himself out of the car while trying to be helpful but confused by the massive amount of buttons on the dashboard, pops the hood open. When he closes it, he ends up trapping Mike in the engine compartment. Mike shouts, ""Don't touch anything!"" and pushes a button that launches the entire car into chaotic malfunction, such as conga music playing loudly. by the massive amount of buttons on the dashboard, pops the hood open. When he closes it, he ends up trapping Mike in the engine compartment. Audio Commentary with Leo Gould (son of Roger Gould) and Nicholas Docter (son of Pete Docter). Do not listen to this audio commentary, as this has got to be the two most ghastly American children and the most obnoxious I have ever heard in my lifetime and should have been banned from this audio commentary, as they were totally useless and most of the time you cannot understand a word they are saying and is totally incomprehensible and should never of been allowed near the microphone. Running Time: 3:43

Boundin' [2003] This short animated film features a sheep that lives in the American West whose elegant dancing is popular with the other animals. One day the sheep-shearers arrive and shear him for wool. Having lost his coat, the other animals laugh at the sheep and he becomes shy and loses the confidence to dance. It is whilst in his bare state that a benevolent jackalope comes across the little lamb and teaches him the merits of ""bounding"" rather than. The sheep is converted and his joy in life is totally restored. The sheep's wool eventually grows back in the winter, only for it to be cut again, but his pride is now completely unshaken and he continues to ""bound."" It is also implied that the jackalope has helped other animals before the sheep to make life well worth living for. Narrated by Bud Luckey. Audio Commentary with Bud Luckey. Running Time: 4:43

Jack-Jack Attack [2005] This short PIXAR animated film shows Rick Dicker, a government agent assigned to aid ""supers"" in maintaining their anonymity, giving Kari an interview about what happened when she was babysitting Jack-Jack. Kari calls Mrs. Parr to assure her that she can take care of Jack-Jack, but is cut off by the plane being fired upon. Thinking nothing is wrong; Kari asks Jack-Jack if he is ready for some ""neurological stimulation."" She puts on Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 for him, which has the result of Jack-Jack having an epiphany about his latent superpowers. To calm Jack-Jack down, Kari tries showing him flashcards. This works well until she shows him a card of a campfire, at which point he suddenly bursts into flames. Horrified, Kari picks up Jack-Jack with a pair of tongs and takes him to the bathroom, where she douses him in the bathtub. The short shows us that, adding to his lead, fire, and monster powers, Jack-Jack also has the ability to create portals in solid objects as he touches them, anti-gravity, and laser vision. Running Time: 4:36

One Man Band [2005] The story begins with a man, named Bass, playing multiple brass instruments, and tries to get a little girl to tip him a coin, but soon meets another musician, named Treble with orchestral instruments. They both instantly become rivals and fight over the girl's coin until she accidentally drops the coin, which falls into a drain. The girl starts to cry and is then angered by the two musicians causing her to lose it, and demands the two one-man-bands for a replacement coin, but they reveal that they are poor and broke. She takes one of the violins from the orchestra one-man-band, re-tuned it, and played an unexpected tune. A rich man, pleased by her performance, gives her a big bag of coins, and the girl eagerly picks it up. Before leaving, she takes two coins for the one-man-bands and tosses them into the top of a fountain, where she was originally going to put her coin in for a wish. After the credits roll, the two musicians work together in an attempt at reaching the top, where the two coins remain. The music during the credits is Pablo de Sarasate's Zigeunerweisen. Audio Commentary with Andrew Jimenez, Mark Andrews, and Michael Giacchino. Running Time: 4:32

Mater and the Ghostlight [2006] The PIXAR animated short film opens with Mater playing pranks on the other residents of Radiator Springs. This sequence culminates with Mater teasing Lightning as if he had seen ""the Ghostlight,"" a Route 66 legend recounted to Pixar by Dean Walker of the Kansas Historic Route 66 Association. Sheriff admonishes him for mocking the urban legend, and then tells the tale of the Ghostlight. The rest of the gang say goodnight and turn off all the store lights, leaving a nervous and scared Mater all alone in the dark. During the body of the short, mayhem ensues as Mater is pursued by the Ghostlight, ultimately revealed to be just a lantern affixed to Mater's towing cable by Lightning and Guido. The other residents of Radiator Springs watch as Mater drives around frantically with the ""Ghostlight"" on his tail, before Mater tires himself out and the cars tell him it was all a prank to pay him back for all his pranks he played on them. Sheriff gently tells Mater that the only thing to be scared of on Route 66 is ""his imagination."" Doc jokingly adds that all Mater really had to fear was ""The Screaming Banshee"" before they all leave Mater, alone and frightened once again. In a post-credits scene, Mater actually sees The Screaming Banshee but, not realizing it is him, warns him of the Banshee, leaving the monster truck confused. Audio Commentary with John Lasseter and Dan Scanlon. Running Time: 7:09

Lifted [2006] A young alien, Stu, is in a spaceship taking an examination in abduction. He must snatch Ernie, a sleeping farmer under the watchful eye of his instructor, Mr. B. However, there is an array of thousands of unlabelled toggle switches he must manipulate to get the human into the ship's tractor beam, and he is having trouble. He mistakenly propels the human into walls and occasionally the ceiling and never waking up from his slumber through it all). After repeated failures to successfully lift the human into the ship (he almost succeeds, but forgets to close the door on the bottom of the ship before turning off the tractor beam, Mr. B takes over, returns the farmer back to his room, and cleans up the mess that Stu had made. Ashamed over his failure, Stu starts whimpering, trying to hold his tears back from Mr. B. Mr. B generously allows Stu to launch the space ship back home. Full of glee, Stu takes hold of the joystick and starts to lift the ship into the air, but once again, he fails, and the space ship plummets to the Earth, crushing Ernie's house and leaving nothing but a crater with a tall pillar of dirt in the centre, atop which Ernie is still sleeping soundly in his bed. The ship quickly lifts off again. During the end credits there is the sound of an alarm clock, the farmer waking up, and then a Wilhelm scream as Ernie (presumably) falls into the crater all around him, and finally, a thud. Audio Commentary with Gary Rydstrom. Running Time: 5:00

Blu-ray Video Quality  PIXAR and Walt Disney Studios has once again come together and brought us something truly special, with the Blu-ray disc PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION with a brilliant stunning gorgeous 1080p image transfer that further demonstrates PIXAR and Walt Disney Studios commitment to visual quality with regards to high definition. I knew I would have a great time revisiting PIXAR's shorts, but I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by the picture. In reality, most of the short films in the collection are as beautiful as the recent Blu-ray transfers. Colours leap off the screen, contrast is spot-on, and fine details are jaw-droopingly sharp. The only downside in the package is the presentation of some the earliest shorts. Given their age, I suppose it shouldn't surprise that The Adventures of Andr and Wally B.; Luxo Jr; Red's Dream and Tin Toy just don't have the same vibrancy as the digital-to-digital transfers of the other more recent shorts, and are plagued by pixilation and drab colours. With that being said, I can hardly complain. PIXAR and Disney Pixar have given us stunning visual landscape of high definition for the most part, and the PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION Volume 1 is a visual wonder that will simply take your breath away.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  PIXAR and Walt Disney Studios has once again come together and brought us something truly special, with this Blu-ray disc multi audio presentation. Which features a very powerful 5.1 LPCM uncompressed Audio Surround mix that shook the room on several occasions. Music is the key element in the majority of the animated shorts and I'm happy to report that it is not a front heavy affair. The surrounds are used to full effect to deliver an orchestra of treble whines and bass booms across the entire sound field experience. The dancing melodies in Geri's Game and One Man Band are crisp and light, as are the most striking of the bunch and showcase extremely aggressive soundscapes to great effect, as is the dynamics which are particularly impressive. Knick Knack once again receives the benefits of its remaster, but the four opening shorts don't pack nearly the same impact as their more modern animated shorts, especially The Adventures of Andr and Wally B. is easily the weakest of the bunch, as that was one of their first attempt at computer animation. Still, comparing this disc to its standard-definition counterpart, even the early shorts receive a noticeable high-definition audio upgrade, so I can't complain too much. In the end, this Blu-ray disc sound is as good as it is and PIXAR fans will be very pleased to find out how much respect has been paid to this PIXAR Blu-ray Collection of astounding shorts.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: As you will have viewed with each PIXAR animated film shorts, apart from Jack-Jack Attack, it is blessed with a very engaging and very informative commentary with each animation short viewed that allows the individual filmmakers and project teams to discuss their work. They talk about the stories, the animation techniques used, and the significance and milestones established by each short film. The only problem I had with this feature is that when you get three people talking about the process of that certain animated short, they tended to start talking over each other and in the end you cannot understand what they are talking about and becomes a blur in the end and I am none the wiser about how that certain animated short was achieved, but with some of the animation I wanted to hear more, but the commentaries are limited to the length of each animated short and it was much better when you had only one person doing the audio commentary, and  one of them was John Lasseter, but the other audio commentary that really impressed me the most was Lifted that was of course directed by Gary Rydstrom, who was utterly fascinating to listen to and was so instructive on how the animation process was done, as well as all the technical aspect of the animation process, to give the look Gary Rydstrom wanted the animation to look a certain way, so top marks Gary Rydstrom.

Special Feature: The Pixar Shorts: A Short History [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1 / 1.33:1] [22:18] The story of PIXAR's early short films illuminates not only the evolution of the company but also the early days of computer animation, when a small group of artists and scientists shared a single computer in a hallway, and struggled to create emotionally compelling short films. This is a wonderful featurette that only disappoints when the credits roll. It could easily have been a feature length documentary. The PIXAR animators appear in interviews and archive footage that track the development of the PIXAR studio, and its technologies, and its brilliant inventive animation. Contributors to this very special feature documentary are John Lasseter, Jim Blinn, Eben Ostby, Craig Good, Loren Carpenter, Ralph Guggenheim, Ed Catmull, Alvy Ray Smith, Bill Reeves, Tom Porter and Deirdre Warin.

Special Feature: Sesame Street Clips [2007] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:00] In 1991, PIXAR made four CGI animated shorts vignettes produced for the TV series Sesame Street. The animated shorts illustrates different weights and directions starring Luxo Sr and Luxo Jr. in the following titles Surprise [1992]; Light and Heavy [1990]; Up and Down [1993] and Front and Back [1994]. Sesame Street producer Arlene Sherman recalled how the shorts came about: With PIXAR, I was helping to train their animators for Toy Story. They needed to gear up a lot of people, so the PIXAR people and I had a mutual feeling about the show and sensibility, and so I would never know when I was getting another animation. I would approve the storyboards, and then I would get these packages in the mail, with these wonderful Luxo Jr. pieces. I've had to work a lot with relationships, and use the good feeling that Sesame Street is promoting. Working as a producer is a real advantage there, because people want to work for the show.

Finally, the PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION Volume 1 is that rare treat, of a totally niche titled produced with the same care and attention that we have come to expect from the blockbusters like 'Cars' and 'Ratatouille.' This Blu-ray edition features an excellent video transfer, a very confident and awesome audio track, and a very nice offering of supplemental material. PIXAR is to be commended for their studio ""business model"" outlook. Not only do they continue to push the boundaries of current computer technology, but their dedication to the art of animation, as well as simply telling a good story, is totally phenomenal. And the finished products of these efforts have been highly enjoyable and especially using a shorts programme concept to develop brand new techniques and PIXAR are always breaking with traditional animation especially compared to some of other less-experienced studio animators animation around. This one is definitely worth picking up for enthusiastic fans of PIXAR animated films in general and that includes me and is perfect to add to your ever increasing PIXAR Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!
