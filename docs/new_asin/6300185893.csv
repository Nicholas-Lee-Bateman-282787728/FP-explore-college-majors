223275,5,6300185893,"THE PLAINSMAN is probably all the things its champions and its detractors say it is. Graham Greene felt it was the best western ever made when he reviewed it in 1936. Others point to the clumsy plotting and awkward  pacing. However, there are things in it which are just wonderful! Take the  opening sequence, with the illegal gun runners plotting how to get around  government laws. It is tightly written, bitterly ironic and flawlessly  acted. Indeed, it is as up-to-date as John Le Carre's fine novel about  illegal gun runners of today -- THE NIGHT MANAGER. There are beautifully  handled set-pieces, especially the shoot-out on a dusty, deserted street,  shot in one long take, in which Cooper kills three villains. No MTV-style  editing here, no tight close-ups of guns exploding, bodies flying, etc. You  aren't asking yourself after the scene is over, how did he kill all those  guys? And then there is Cooper's performance -- since he knew from the  beginiing that his character was to die at the end, he played throughout as  if his Hickok was doomed and well knew it. The weary fatalism in the way he  utters his lines, the bleak look in his eyes for most of the film, it is a  very, very fine performance. A performance which isn't given its due,  perhaps because it is a DeMille film. For all its flaws, this is a movie  with a great deal recommending it. Try it.",952905600,21,1376,4.62396694214876

223523,1,6300185893,"The Plainsman (Cecil B DeMille, 1936, 113')

The Plainsman is a 1936 American Western film directed by Cecil B DeMille (1881-1959), starring Gary Cooper (Wild Bill Hickok) and Jean Arthur (Calamity Jane). Music is by George Antheil, cinematography by Victor Milner. The film is in the best tradition of DeMille's preference for epic bombast: DeMille was an American film director and Academy Award-winning film producer in both silent and sound films. He was renowned for the flamboyance and showmanship of his movies. Among his best-known films are Cleopatra; Samson and Delilah; The Greatest Show on Earth, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture; and The Ten Commandments, which was his last and most successful film.

The film presents a highly fictionalized account of the adventures and relationships between Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), and General George Custer (John Miljan), with a gun-runner named Lattimer (Charles Bickford) as the main villain. The film is notorious for mixing times and even has an opening scene with Abraham Lincoln setting the stage for Hickok's adventures. Anthony Quinn has a cameo as an Indian. (A remake using the same title was released in 1966.)

It is hard to take the movie seriously today unless one wants to give period credit to it, which I find too much honour. Acting is disappointing, but more the director's than the actors' fault. One star will do.

223524,4,6300185893,"DeMille researched his works thoroughly, but condensed the history and often threw things out, saying if one filmed the real thing it looked sham.  Also, he knew the audience didn't want to see a documentary.  He aimed to please the audience, not the critics.  Also, this was one of two teamings in 1936 with Arthur and Cooper, the other being MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN.  Interestingly, after that year, they never teamed again.  Both are wonderful in their parts, fitting them perfectly.  THE PLAINSMAN didn't do well financially, but is nonetheless entertaining.  Wonderful character actors throughout and fine action scenes.  DeMille at his best!

223582,4,6300185893,"This is one of the many films made in Hollywood over the years featuring historical characters from the Old West.  In ""The Plainsman,"" the characters are Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), General Custer (John Miljan), and Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur).  Don't even try to relate the plot of this 1936 film to history -- you'll get a headache.  Don't even try to figure whether the portrayals in this film are accurate.  Accept that ""The Plainsman"" is a pastiche of characters and tales, loosely hung on legends.

Instead, enjoy the performances, along with Hollywood's version of Old West dialog and lingo.  Gary Cooper is superb as Wild Bill Hickok, following his own internal code of manliness, honor, and right.  Compare his portrayal of a Western hero with the tone of more recent Western films, and you'll better understand how America has changed since the 1930s.  Jean Arthur is wonderful as Calamity Jane, who has her eye on Wild Bill, even though it's mostly ""one-sided love"" till close to the end.

As in most 1930s and 1940s Westerns, the Native American characters are stereotyped.  This is balanced, however, by a plot that shows how venal white traders set conflict in motion.

This film was produced by the master of the Hollywood epic, Cecil B. DeMille, 20 years before he made ""The Ten Commandments.""  Notice too how ""The Plainsman"" prefigures his later epic films.

223585,4,6300185893,"You will, of course, have to suspend your disbelief to properly enjoy this movie, which, as the opening crawl baldly admits, condenses some 10 or 12 years of history into a span of perhaps two or three and improves upon reality with several imaginary incidents.  That much said, DeMille (who was known in Hollywood as *the* director for sprawling epics) and Cooper and Arthur (who had already teamed successfully that year in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Deeds-Goes-to-Town-Remastered/dp/B001GLX6US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (Remastered)</a>) are all up to their best standards, and I only wish they could have filmed in color (which, by 1936, they could have) for maximum impact.  Cooper plays Wild Bill Hickok, who returns to the West after service in the Union forces and reconnects with his old friend Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison) (the two did in fact know each other, and even appeared on stage together in a play written by Ned Buntline) and the West's wildest tomboy, Calamity Jane (Arthur), who's been pursuing him for as long as they've known each other.  As the Indian wars heat up, the trio are swept up into one thrilling situation after another, including the Battle of Beecher's Island (an actual incident of 1868) and capture by Cheyennes, the latter of which forces Hickok to--almost--admit his true feelings for Calamity.  The high point of the movie may be Arthur's performance: an expert in high-spirited, outspoken females, she brings Jane vividly to life (and her jackboots, jaunty Union forage cap, buckskin jacket, and embroidered gauntlets are a very suitable outfit indeed), showing several sides of this fascinating and still controversial character--sometimes insanely courageous, sometimes sentimental, and always loyal.  Perennial Western sidekicks ""Gabby"" Hayes and Fuzzy Knight appear as ""Breezy"" and Dave, and a very young (21) Anthony Quinn as a Cheyenne Indian.",1282608000,,1973,5.585284280936455

This is Hollywood History, drama not education. Lincoln talks of disbanded soldiers who are without work. [A reference to the 1930s.] The solution is to colonize the grasslands of the West using soldiers and rifles. ""We can sell rifles to the Indians and they can pay in fur."" [Is there a flaw in this plan?] There is shocking news! There is a comic scene in St. Louis. The speeches tell about the customer's expectations. A gift of a big knife to a small boy. Bill Hickok plays cards, and loses until he wins. Mr. Lattimer collects his shipment from the steamboat.

A stagecoach takes Bill Cody and wife from Leavenworth to Hays City. [Are two horses enough for that coach?] A lone rider warns of danger. Hickok offers help to General Custer in the Indian Wars. Bill Cody will guide the relief troop to Fort Piney. Duty calls. ""Don't cry, honey."" The dreaded redskins arrive for more drama. Bill Hickok deals for Calamity Jane. ""Don't give up your guns!"" Hickok has a plan. Yellowhand appreciates the latest technology. He has a complaint against broken promises. [So do the paleface voters.] What about bullets? Can they make Hickok squeal? Extreme interrogation techniques are to try to get information on the relief troops. The troops are then caught in the open! Calamity Jane will ride for help.

Hickok rides to the trapped troop. Days pass. Massed fire halts an attack. A trumpet sounds, the reinforcement arrive. Who will rescue Calamity Jane? Who sold rifles to the Indians? Will Hickok get revenge? There is a shoot-out with some soldiers. Calamity Jane brings a warning. Custer wants Bill Cody. Hickok and Cody meet for lunch. A stray Indian brings news of Custer's Last Stand. Hickok leaves for Deadwood, Cody will warn Generals Merritt and Crook. Is Hickok feeling alright? [Maybe he had the blues?] Hickok meets Lattimer. ""Can't you see?"" Shots are fired. They have a card game to pass the time until the Fifth Cavalry arrives. Hickok sits for his last hand. ""We won't forget what Bill Hickok has done.""

Those who read history books will laugh at this drama because of its distorted history. Wild Bill Hickok was a Pony Express rider, Jayhawker, Civil War scout and soldier, then a lawman on the Frontier. He once shot some rowdy soldiers but faced no charges. A ""calamity"" was the term for a personal illness. Bill Cody also has a real history; the most important was his show business ""Wild West"". Many Americans gained their knowledge from dime novels that used imagination instead of facts. The importance of this film is the propaganda history of that short era from the Civil War to the late 1870s. Easterners wrote about the ""Wild West"" as if it was propaganda to keep people from migrating to lands where they would have more liberty and less crime than in the settled cities of the East. The important history of the late 19th century was the rise of big corporations that attacked small businesses and farmers who settled and tamed the West.",1255564800,,3137,4.827137546468402

The sparks really fly between Wild Bill (Gary Cooper) and Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur)--such on-screen chemistry.

I have been to the sites of other notable Indian fights, including both the Fetterman Massacre and Little Big Horn, and although distinctive in their own ways, they are basically just dusty hills in barren grasslands.  Beecher's Island was different.  It occured near a rare shady spot along a ""river"" which now is usually nothing but a dry shallow gulch running through some private grazing land; at the time of Major Forsyth's engagement with the Cheyenne under Roman Nose the Arikara River was a formidable obstacle with a few spits of sandy ground--the ""island""-jutting up in the middle.  At one end of the gulch/river bed there is a bluff some fifty feet or so high from behind which the Cheyenne formed, launched their charges, and rallied.  At the summit of the bluff lies Roman Nose, killed in the battle, his lonely grave marker still (as of the mid-1990s) faithfully tended by unknown locals.  The ""island"" itself looked completely unlike any other battlefield of the Plains Indian Wars, being tiny, made of sand, and strewn with dirftwood, which Forsyth and his little band formed into a sort of breastworks.

Almost all of this terrain is faithfully recreated in ""The Plainsman."" Obviously DeMille didn't shoot this in the Colorado Badlands; there was a contemporary pencil sketch in Harper's Weekly, and perhaps they based the scene on that.  Whatever the reason, I was impressed.  Now, if only they had had the Buffalo Soldiers rescue Forsyth's party, as they did in reality (a monument to them is present at the battlefield). . . .

I would be curious to know if anyone else has some insight into this?

223649,4,6300185893,"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends.
TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good - just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal!
BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt - in some cases - a whole box seems more appropriate!",1109980800,32,1497,4.897637795275591

223651,4,6300185893,"On September 17, 1868, while fording the south fork of the Republican River in what is now Colorado, General ""Sandy"" Forsyth was ambushed by 600 Cheyennes and Arapahoes. Outnumbered ten to one, Forsyth and his troops took refuge on a brushy island in the middle of the river and for nine days stood off one of the fierest charges in the history of Indian wars. The ten years which followed this gallant episode saw the final defeat of the Indians on the Northern half of the Great Plains. Some 300 battles were fought, chiefly against the Sioux and Cheyennes. In 1876, the two nations rallied to wipe out General Custer's regiment on the Little Big Horn. By 1880, Indians were no longer a power on the plains. Cecil B. DeMille, the producer of super-colassal spectacles of the thirties and forties goes the American West for THE PLAINSMAN. The film opens with a prologue shot of President Lincoln and his Cabinet, from then on compresses many actual events in the history of the Great Plains. Its hero and heroine are two of the most famous characters of the West ""Wild"" Bill Hickok and ""Calamity Jane"" ably portrayed by Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur (whose Calamity is decidedly more glamourous - with rouge and mascara applied - than was the real Martha Jane Canary!) In one segment, the Cheyennes ambush Buffalo Bill for twelve minutes ; it was considered quite an exciting climax to 1937 audiences.",1004659200,12,1400,4.741803278688525
223652,4,6300185893,"The Plainsman is terrific fun, grand and old-fashioned movie-making in the best sense of the word. Gary Cooper is splendid as Wild Bill Hickok. And even though the facts are bent and twisted, there is something so honest in  his portrayal of Hickok, you get the idea that he has managed to reveal the  real Hickok. Jean Arthur is also wonderful, as Calamity Jane. A real flaw  is James Ellison as Buffalo Bill, he throws off every scene he appears in,  especially when in the same frame as the iconic Cooper. It is also less  than politically correct in its treatment of Native Americans.",954115200,,588,4.615384615384615
