I really liked her ideas--especially the toys, temperature ideas, drink ideas, and the ways to jazz up water.  I am not excited to try new things with my picky eaters!  Thank you for creating this.",1308441600,,367,4.185714285714286
8079332,4,B000AS1Q4Q,"I got this dvd because my dtr started Kindergarten this year.  I remember when i was a kid i used to think the kids that brought their lunches were so cool.  So, in an effort to increase my dtr's likability and nutrition, I figured i would pack her lunch.  So, we got the dvd (and several other lunch books) and we watched it together = FIRST MISTAKE.  I shouldnt have let her in on all the secrets.  She knew exactly what to expect.  So then, we went to the craft/cake decorating store and bought like 50 different cookie cutters of all shapes and sizes =SECOND MISTAKE.  I should have done that myself, alone, w/o my dtr because she wanted every single cookie cutter they had and wanted every shape for lunch every day.  Grr...  So then i made her lunches.  So, the first day, she was happy.  I made two little dolphin shaped pb&j sandwiches.  She thought it was the coolest thing and ate almost all of both of the little sandwiches.  In that same lunch, i also packed applesauce, trail mix, sliced apples with star cutouts in them and some other ideas provided by the dvd... So i did all this work and do you know what?  The ONLY thing she ate was the dolphin sandwiches.  So i was like ok, don't worry... It's only the first day = THIRD MISTAKE.  I just kept thinking my dtr would warm up to the idea.  Puh-leez!!!!!!  I think if i hadnt made mistakes 1 and 2 maybe she woudl have eaten more.  But, honestly, i don't think she even eats lunch at all!  After about the 3rd week of her lunch box coming home full - she even stopped eating her sandwiches - i told her she could buy her lunch if she wanted to.  I wanted her to eat after all, and maybe her friends bought their lunches and that was the ""in"" thing for now.  So, i sent her to school with some $$.  Turns out, she likes buying her lunch a lot better.  So, now i have this really neat dvd with TONS of lunch ideas (which I think makes lunch facinating...) and 50+ cookie cutters in all shapes and sizes (i bought more thinking maybe she didn't like the shapes i had, even though SHE picked them out), and no lunch to make.  Ok, i know i can make lunches for me too, but honestly, i barely had time to make the lunches for my dtr.  I mean, these lunches are really INVOLVED!!!  It's seriously like creating edible artwork!!  I wanted to take pictures each and every time i made one!!  LOL!!

I woudl totally recommend this book for kids who like eating in general and usually eat everything that they are given.  However, i kinda think my dtr is more of a chit-chat diva during lunch and basically cant wait to get up and go play.  Seriously, this DVD had some amazing ideas, which is why i gave it 4 stars.  I only didn't give it 5 because as amazing as i thought it was, it didn't work for my kiddo.  No worries though.  I can still use the ideas for birthday parties and get togethers!!  IT really has some very cool ideas!!!  :D",1228435200,,2895,4.217153284671533
8079333,5,B000AS1Q4Q,"This is a great video!  It is full of creative ideas to make lunches your kids are excited about.  With it comes a tiny little recipe book of about 10 pages or so, but with good ideas.  I use it often. This is a great video that will spark you creative side in making your child's lunch.  My daughter is of the rare few that does not like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and is somewhat of a picky eater, this video gave me some great ideas and it seems that if you make it fun they are more willing to try different things.",1225584000,,527,4.038461538461538

8079335,5,B000AS1Q4Q,This DVD was great!  I really enjoyed all the wonderful ideas in this DVD.  The ideas are so creative.  It has inspired me to make healthy lunches for my children this upcoming school year.  Even if you walk away with only 1 or 2 tips it is worth the money.

You could use them for parents' lunches, too. Our family has definitely been stuck in a food rut this past year. This DVD has helped us mix it up at lunch time.",1150416000,3,317,4.0476190476190474
