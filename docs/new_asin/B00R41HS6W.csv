8694016,5,B00R41HS6W,"This film provides a window into the murky world of children born from rapes in wartime--in particular the war leading to the creation of Bangladesh during which it was the Pakistani state policy to rape Bengali women to make them pregnant to bring about 'loyal' citizens of Pakistan instead of those rebelling to create Bangladesh. These tens of thousands of children were given a bad start in life deliberately by the State itself--and it never led to any prosecutions of the guilty soldiers. The film explores the story of one such child of a Bengali women who was kidnapped away from her family and husband. In the end, due to the willingness of his Bengali father in bringing up the rape child as his own and accepting his wife when she was freed at the end of the conflict, the child grows up into a balanced young man. The kid, now all grown up, sides with Bangladesh while accepting that his father is likely a Pakistani soldier who brutalized his mother and family. So, instead of being part or all Pakistani, he turns out to be 100% Bangladeshi.
The film does benefit from knowledge of the creation of the genocide unleashed in then East Pakistan to suppress Bengalis there after their candidate won the elections in Pakistan. When a peaceful transfer of power to a Bengali was ruled out, rebellion broke out. This rebellion was suppressed brutally with summary executions the norm. The Hindus of East Pakistan were singled out for annihilation and close to wiped out. The Muslims of East Pakistan fared only a bit better. The systematic focus on rape to procreate children as part of a military strategy to destroy the social fabric of the country was a novel military tactic for which Pakistan has never been forced to accept responsibility or make reparations. The film explores only a small part of this part of gruesome history.
Mrityunjay Devvrat is an exciting director who is not afraid to handle difficult themes with aplomb. I recommend the film highly for its direction and production values. This is his first film. We can only hope he makes more films. The film had a great run in India and Bangladesh--actually two runs in Bangladesh and won several awards. It would be nice if this film were also carried by Netflix and other similar services--possibly Amazon Prime (ARE YOU LISTENING). I could not locate it on either. The decision making at these organizations is wanting because such an excellent award winning film is almost impossible to find and watch on demand due to the absence of even such minimal investment in good content for their viewers. Until better sense prevails in these and similar behemoth custodians, this DVD is the only option.",1487894400,,2677,4.809110629067245

8694018,2,B00R41HS6W,"If you did not know the history of this conflict then this film does a poor job of clearly and objectively explaining who the combatants were; their motivations; their history in the region; any conflictual interests such as religion, economics; tribal or familial interests. I have no personal interest in this conflict but could sense a bias in how it was presented which demeans the many lives that were lost.
There were three main groups - West Pakistan, India, & East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Within those groups were numerous subgroups with their own agendas concerning the outcome of independence for that region. Thus a far more complex entanglement than shown.",1445644800,,667,5.128440366972477

Directed By: Mrityunjay Devvrat.

Disclaimer: Think Babel the scene where the actors cannot find a way past the desert, think Life is Beautiful the scene where Joshua celebrates when he sees the tank in the end add the two together, yet this one rattles you with a little higher pedigree.

Plot: The script is taken forward by concentrating on two distinct stories. First is about the journey of teenager Rafiq and his sister Kausar to escape from East Pakistan to a safer India and second about the travails of journalist Aamir and his kidnapped and raped wife Fida. Both the stories move forward with introduction of new characters and situations. Screenplay ensures that that there is something hard hitting enough to keep you on the edge.

Actor Prepares: The actors do not disappoint. Indraneil Sengupta, Raima Sen, Tillotoma Shome, Victor Bannerjee and Farooque Sheikh fit into their part. Young Rhiddhi Sen makes an impact with delightful consistency.

Directors Cut:  Director Mritunjay Devvrat deserves accolades for managing to come up with a film like this in his debut effort. The success of the screenplay is in displaying hope, uncertainty and rage among the citizens and the violence that they were meted out. The Pakistani armys idea of suppression through rape will disgust you. Also a winner is the spellbinding cinematography. There are multiple rape scenes but at no point do they seem targeted at titillating the audience but completely ensuring that they evoke empathy.

Spoilers: The length of the movie at 162 minutes is the only glitch here. It tends to tire you out in the end.

Just Wow: Children Of War helps us reflect on one of the grossest violations that have ever been witnessed by humanity. More importantly the film helps understand that war for independence may have ended, but the struggle for justice has not.

Grade: A++++ (Endure the pain, its not entertainment, its purely cinema at its painful best)",1421712000,,2011,5.033132530120482
8694020,5,B00R41HS6W,"In one of the many mind-numbing images in this exceptionally vivid work on the ravages of war, the back of a truck is jolted open and out tumble a bunch of women one on top of another at a Pakistani prison camp for Bangladeshi women run by a despicable tyrant, who could be the Nazi mass murderer Ralph Fiennes in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List.

But no. It's Pavan Malhotra, brilliantly evil and slimy as the man who believes that if Pakistani soldiers rape and impregnate enough Bangladeshi women, the separatists and freedom fighters would stop dreaming of their own homeland.

This is the irrational, blood-soaked ravaged Pakistan of 1971 when Bangladesh was born out of the most horrific violence perpetrated against humanity.

Very often as I watched debutant director Mrityunjay Devvrat's stunning film, I was reminded of the great anti-Nazi films, like Alan Pakula's Sophie's Choice, Richard Attenborough's A Bridge Too Far, and Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards.

I was also reminded of Nandita Das's Firaaq about Gujarat's 2002 genocide where a truckload of corpses had tumbled out. The difference is, the women who fall from the truck like trash from a garbage van in Children Of War are alive.

They might as well be dead.

As these Bangladeshi women, played by actresses of various ages - from 12 years to 40 years, who seem to live every second of the agony, are raped repeatedly you wonder how low human beings can fall when given unlimited power.

Rape as a tool of oppression has never served a more brutal purpose in any other film except Shekhar Kapur's Bandit Queen. And you wonder why the man or woman, who sits in the boss' chair in the corporate organization, is no different from the leery neo-Nazi from the Pakistani concentration camp who supervises the mass rape of Bangladeshi women.

Children Of War shows how and why absolute power corrupts absolutely. Revisiting the Bangladesh war of liberation in 1971, it recreates with nerve wracking vividness the horrors of those times when suddenly a whole civilization was threatened with extinction.

The director spares us none of the agonizing details. Why should he? When humanity suffered, first world countries turned their faces away. It's time to face the music.

The unannounced midnight knock and the graphic rape that follows, the brutal slaying of refugees on the run as they are intercepted and shot point blank (in slow motion) on a river bridge as they try to escape, the leery Nazi-like army man urinating onto a prisoner's face. War never seemed more like a personal and political violation.

This is not a film for the squeamish. But then war was never meant for the civilised. The sheer incivility of a strife where one bully-section of a country decides to teach another section of the people a lesson, is captured in layer after layer of unstrapped brilliance portraying the complete collapse of compassion.

The film is littered with passages of unbearable pain and, yes, agonizing beauty. It is an indelible irony of all visual arts that human hurt makes for great visuals. The lush lyricism that the director supplants to the suffering never takes from the powerful statement on pain and suffering.

Cinematographer Fasahat Khan shoots the chilling nights with prowling predators and ravaged women captured together to emblematise the essential conflict between sexual aggression and vulnerable victims.

There is no manipulation here in the merger of the murky and the magnificent. They have co-existed from time immemorial. In this film, the ugly and the cherishable are so close together you can touch both and come away a changed film viewer. The plot moves across several epic conflicts simultaneously. There is a teenager Rafiq (played with heartrending vulnerability by Riddhi Sen) who loses his entire family and his home and is left with only a sister (Rucha Inamdar) to flee from the brutality of his homeland to the relative safety of India.

Rafiq's journey becomes a metaphor of Bangladesh's feral fight for freedom.

While the director has made extensive and telling use of documentary footage, including Indira Gandhi's rationale for Indian intervention in Bangladesh, there are many passages of unbounded symbolism leaping out of the screen. I was specially fascinated by a boat journey across a blood-soaked tell-tale river where a girl sees ghosts and other casualties of war violence as they jostle to tell her it is not over yet.

A true blue epic of mind-numbing intensity Children Of War is the kind of cinema that David Lean would have attempted were he a witness to the barbarism that went into the formation of Bangladesh. The film's brutal brilliance and spiralling structure of dread doom and devastation make you wonder how first time director Mriyunjay Devvrat could muster such a masterly vision of human oppression and resilience.

At heart this is a conventional lovely story of a couple (Indraneil Sengupta and Raima Sen) separated by sudden war. Standing forlorn, silhouetted by barbed wires in a concentration camp, Raima sometimes looks way too beautiful to be a victim. She can't help it.

Along with her every member of the cast rises above his or her personality to become part of the director's epic design. Special mention must be made of Pavan Malhotra, Tilotama Shome (playing a human bomb), Riddhi (so young and so much pain!) and Victor Bannerjee in a memorable cameo as a traveling refugee reminds us that humanism and barbarism are neighbours.

Aiding the actors to achieve the acme of authenticity is the film's mesmeric sound-design and music. In one harrowing graphic sequence, a rock anthem reverberates across the skyline as drains filled with blood tell sagas of the savagery that waits just outside our homes.

Genocide is not only history. It is what a country gets when intolerance is encouraged by political interests.

There are visuals and sounds of pain and anguish in this turbulent treatise on one of history's worst atrocities that will stay with me forever.

It is impossible to believe that this war epic has been directed by a first time filmmaker. How can a virgin artiste conceive such a vivid portrait of the rape of a civilization?

This isn't really a film. It's a work of art, tempestuous and terrific.

Yes, this is a masterpiece.",1421712000,28,6310,5.021072796934866
