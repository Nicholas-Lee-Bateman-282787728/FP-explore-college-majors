4263209,5,B0045JQ3L2,"Two thirtysomething gay men from Los Angeles flee to a quiet guesthouse in Palm Springs, to escape the media.  One of them is Graham Windsor (Steve Callahan), a soap opera actor whose gay sex tape just outed him and cost him his job.  The other is Trey Reed (Matthew Montgomery), a well-known activist for gay marriage, who was caught cheating on his own spouse.  The two clash at first, with the openly gay activist considering the closeted actor as a coward, but it soon becomes evident there is a real spark between them, sexually as well as helping them each open up and be honest about their situations and options.

This is the latest of Rob Williams' writer/director credits (also did ""Long Term Relationship,"" ""Back Soon,"" and ""Make the Yuletide Gay"" - the latter one of my favorites of 2009, and I am glad to hear a sequel should be out later this year!), and he seems to get better with each one. A well conceived, realistic story, likeable characters played by capable actors, and beautifully photographed, with tasteful erotic content (unrated, but would be an R). Supporting actors stealing several scenes are Jm J Bullock as the actor's agent, and David Pevsner as the older innkeeper.  That said, considering the story is rather simple, I thought the dialogue was a bit wordy at times, but did not detract from the film for my enjoyment.  DVD has commentary, outtakes and a ""making of"" featurette.  Five stars out of five.",1295654400,5,1437,4.746987951807229
4263210,5,B0045JQ3L2,"This movie is not what I expected, it was a lot more.  The cinematography is fantastic.  And the story line actually had a theme.  Thanks for a tastefully and thoughtfully produced movie about conflict, consequences, and intimacy.",1295654400,3,230,5.162162162162162
4263211,5,B0045JQ3L2,"I knew I was going to like this movie before I even saw it.  What wasn't to like, Rob Williams wrote and directed; Matthew Montgomery, Steve Callahan, David Pevsner and Brian Nolan were in it. I loved Jm J Bullock as Bernie, the agent. When it showed at OutFest in July 2010, I bought tickets to both showings. AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.

It's a nice, romantic, talky film.  The scenary was wonderful and so was the Alexander Inn, where they filmed it.  The special features on the DVD are great. I love a DVD with a commentary track.  Sometimes I watch the movie, and then right afterwards, watch  it again with the commentary track.  This was was very good, with Rob Williams doing the commentary.  Would have loved to have had it (or and additional one) with the actors included.  Its nice to know what happened to make such a great film.  Loved the deleted scenes and outtakes.

Get it for your loved ones for Valentine's Day, Presidents' Day, any day of the week/month/year.

The movie is great for a date night and make sure you enjoy your coffee afterwards (you have to watch it to know what this means - ha ha).

And if you like this movie, you'll love Rob Williams other films too:

4263212,5,B0045JQ3L2,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Chicago Reeling Festival this October.  I arrived at the theater hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed by Rob & Matt & Steve. In all honesty, I was blown away!!

I'm probably considered biased toward Rob Williams films but I must say that even I think he outdid himself on this one. His screenplay and choice of soundtrack, in my opinion, is his best to date.  And the choice of casting Matthew Montgomery & Steve Callahan opposite one another was sheer genius.  As these two are Partners in their personal lives, the chemistry sparking between them on film was unmistakable and oh so believable.

I must say I was a bit apprehensive regarding Mr. Callahan transiting from stage to film in a lead role, but with the help of a seasoned director and his ever so talented co-star, this transition was positively seamless. And the supporting cast was phenomenal.

Occurring primarily at one location, the cinematography easily stood up to the Rob Williams standards and allowed the audience to place themselves right there amidst the action.

If you wish to see an uncommon love story which just happens to have gay characters, then this is a must see! But, be prepared to be entertained from word one to the finish!!

4263213,5,B0045JQ3L2,"I had the great opportunity to see Role/Play the movie in Tampa this summer, and can't wait to get my own dvd copy (already purchased).  It showcases the many  talents of Steve Callahan and Matthew Montgomery as the lead actors, as well as Rob Williams as producer.  These two guys are wonderful actors on their own, but to have them acting together - it was amazing.
Rush - don't delay in ordering your own copy - the release date is fast approaching and you'll be dissapointed if you don't get your own copy.

4263214,5,B0045JQ3L2,"I just saw this movie last night at a gay movie festival here, and this was the movie I most wanted to see, and as I thought, I wasn't disappointed at all.  You can read Amos' review  and synopsis above, which I totally agree with.  The movie brings up a lot of relevant and timely points that we deal with and see every day.  How much of a 'public' person's private life do we have the right to know?  It's a debate that's been going on since the dawn of cinema, and beyond.  I really like Rob's films because not only are they entertaining, but they also make you think.  Plus the performance of Steven and Matthew are stellar, as well as the rest of the cast.  It also helps that the 'visuals' are also very nice! There was a Q&A after the movie, and we found out that the shoot for the film lasted ONLY 8 days, which makes the efforts of everyone involved even more remarkable.  This is a definite addition to anyone's collection who is serious about quality movies.  You won't be sorry!",1286496000,27,991,4.279569892473118

4263230,1,B0045JQ3L2,"So badly acted and so weakly written.  The screenwriter is very earnest, with only the simplest (and obvious) of insights.  If one is going to write a screenplay that is essentially one long conversation about gay life in America, then one must have something more to say than the cliches and axioms we've been been repeating since the 80s..  The screenplay sounds almost like it was written by a college sophomore who believes he's as talented as his mother tells him.  The actors do appear to try to get through the awful dialogue, but they simply aren't up to it.  There are so many actually good screenplays out there, it's a shame money was wasted on this one.",1405468800,2,665,4.601694915254237

4263249,1,B0045JQ3L2,Preachy comes to mind when I think about this film.  It seemed interminable watching the two main characters practically turn towards the camera and emote their platitudes.  It felt like I was watching a filmed stage play.  Very static camera and very little coverage.  Great performances by David Pevsner and Brian Nolan.  The two leads were stiff and mannered.  And the ending scene with the soap star's car (which was supposed to be an expensive sports car) sounding and looking like a cheap car someone rustled up for the shot was laughable.,1394841600,2,545,4.869565217391305

4263251,2,B0045JQ3L2,"This movie is another in the clich ridden conga lines of too many Gay male romance releases; two guys who don't like each other at first fall head over heels (literally as well) in spite of it all and end up giving a shot to being more than just boink buddies. The filling in the thin story is ridiculous (taking the fall for a break up because of your political activism for marriage equality?!?!?!). What keeps this mildly cute movie from being more than the sum of its parts is the wooden acting from the two leads. Mr. Callahan is a drop dead handsome man but he needs to take a ""How to use body language"" acting class as well as a ""How to use your voice to emote"" class. In some of the shots, he seemed to just be standing and reading lines. Mr. Montgomery is only slightly better at emoting. David Pevsner is the only ray of light here and he clearly is holding back for the sake of the two leads. Like any good actor, he does more with what he is given. Mr. Pevsner delivers more with the timbre of his voice or a smile or roll of the eyes than the two leads do with their whole bodies (Mr. Pevsner, please help these young men with some acting tips). Amazingly, the two leads have become lovers in real life (and my best wishes to them) yet don't generate much heat in the film though at least they seem playful with each other in the post coital scenes (the only slightly genuine signs of emotion from them). But that and the ample butt shots (bravo to Mr. Pevsner for having the guts to show the youngsters how to embrace their gym bodies by providing a full Monty) cannot salvage this mediocrity. Want to see the passion and sizzle that good acting and directing can bring to a Gay theme movie? Watch August starring Murray Bartlett who sets the screen on FIRE.

But it's marred by clich and implausible plotting; and character development lurches rather than evolves. The pacing is also painfully slow.

At least the script was well written, but I felt as if the theme & message of the plot line was nothing new. I'm a straight woman and I can tell that the issue of actors and actresses hiding their sexuality to keep their mainstream popularity is a topic that's been discussed ad nausea by the gay population. Also, there were a couple of instances in the film where there was too much dialogue and not enough progression of the plot.

The roles were played well by leads Montgomery and Callahan, but their on screen chemistry came up short. That was very surprising given the fact that they are partners in real life.

4263296,1,B0045JQ3L2,"Absolutely amazing.  I cannot believe so many people could be duped by this dungheap of a movie.  The movie, at best, is an insult to any gay man or woman who is seeking to find a lasting and meaningful relationship.  You DON'T find one by lying your a$$ off from the get-go.  And if you believe this is the way the REAL world works, then you'll also believe that West Hollywood isn't populated mainly by twinks.

The premise for this movie is a gay man (playing a lead as a super-hunk STRAIGHT male on a soap) is supposedly outed by his lover--for publicity purposes or whatever.  He holes up at a little B/B in Palm Springs (where else?), swims nude a lot, talks to his agent, and tries to make the viewer feel sorry for him.  Enter the second gay man--the poster boy for the gay marriage issue.  He, too, is on splitsville with his lesser half because of an alleged extra-maritial affair.  Gasp.  The two meat, er, meet while lounging at the pool, lustfull glances are exchanged, and viola, they're in bed.  NEVER saw that coming.  But, I digress.

What you then endure are seemingly endless hours of well-intended dialogue--just not BELIEVABLE dialogue.  Oh, and we get a twist.  Seems straight-playing soap boy LIED about what had really happened in his life AND poster boy for gay marriage LIED as well.  Isn't that the way we all begin our relationships?  It seems straight soap boy was the one that leaked his porn tape; it was poster boy's lesser half that cheated, but he decided to take the fall.  Yeah; right.  And these are magic beans.  I'm sure that if I had spent a good portion of my life trying to sell the idea of gay marriage, I'M gonna' be the one that takes the fall when my marriage falls apart over a rumoured extra-marital affair.  And what's even more ridiculous is that the two liars get mad at one another when the ""truth comes out.""  As if it was ever in either one of them.

Rob Williams doesn't have a clue about making a believable gay film.  But, apparently it doesn't take much to fool you guys.  Not recommended in any way, shape, form, or fashion.",1324252800,9,2083,4.461538461538462

is a little slow, but as both men have secrets that are eventually revealed, the ending makes the middle
sequences worth it. Plus the fact that the two men are so compatible together, not to mention cute, doesn't
hurt either. I've seen a few movies with Matthew Montgomery-Gone but not Forgotten, and recently Socket, both
were pretty good, this didn't dissapoint either, granted this film is more for gays than straight, but it's thoroughly enjoyable. The sex scenes aren't explicit overall, slightly soft-core and the nudity isn't very
graphic either, making it watchable for mainstream  audience as well.",1301875200,6,824,5.195488721804511
4263305,4,B0045JQ3L2,"In our social media culture of diminishing privacy the line between everyone's public persona and his private life is erased which throws gays into a quandary of bad options. Either a gay person publicly broadcasts his sexual orientation and risks career setbacks and community ostracism, or he chooses to keep his privacy and is penalized by falling out of the social norm.

 Rob William's film ROLE/PLAY cuts to the quick of the issue and raises thought provoking questions that will be discussed long after the film ends.

 Though the central characters (played by Steve Callahan and Matthew Montgomery) are media megastars, the issue is something gay men and women confront every day in their less than public lives. How does someone live truthfully without opening their bedroom to the scrutiny of their employer, their neighbors, their church, their bowling league or their kid's scouting troop?

 It's not an easy film. It's not a vapid, campy comedy or a thinly plotted soft-porn. For that reason alone the gay community is fortunate Williams is making a political statement that doesn't pander to sextease. ROLE/PLAY delves into the deep end of American gay culture and risks being drowned by its targets: the paid critics of corporate gay media. This is exactly what independent film should do. Rob Williams' film isn't a cheap exploitation to bring in gay dollars, it's an insightful and probing discussion of queer culture in America.

 The dvd also has two behind the scenes segments which were charming and completely entrancing. Unlike most actor ""interviews"" with scripted soundbytes, I felt like I know these guys after watching Anthony Palato's behind the scenes footage.",1301184000,12,1689,5.1611721611721615

4263307,5,B0045JQ3L2,"Rob Williams keeps getting better and this time has created something more than just sexy and entertaining.  He created something with a some very important and timely messages.

On the surface, Role/Play is a sexy love story.  Just beneath the surface lies some very significant writing conveying what every gay person needs to stop and listen(watch) to.

First comes an examination of the roles we all play.  I think most viewers will immediately react to think and say that while many play roles, they themselves do not.  With repeated viewings of this film, I realized more and more how absolutely true it is.  We play roles for our parents.  We play roles at work.  We create/invent personas to deal with what life gives up and sometimes--many times--we lose ourselves in it all.  Role/Play is a strong signal that we all need to stop and look at ourselves and our roles in our surroundings.

The second message, which I found meaningful was the commentary on gay media becoming a slave to sales and using straight allies of the gay community to achieve sales goals.  In this pursuit, gay media and pay people lose sight of the fact we are important without our straight allies and that our straight allies in our mainstream media dilute our importance to some extent.

The writing, directing and acting in Role/Play are all first rate.  While some will say that talk overran the action and therefore made the film boring miss out on the fact that building true relationships require lots of talk and honest sharing.",1299715200,9,1521,4.8
4263308,4,B0045JQ3L2,"Having worked both as an entertainment journalist who frequently interviewed closeted gay actors, and as an editor for a prominent national gay news-magazine, I was especially interested in this movie.  One of the lead characters is a closeted gay actor; the other is a liberal gay activist.

As Graham Windsor and Trey Reed, the closeted actor and the gay activist, respectively, Steve Callahan and Matthew Montgomery, aided substantially by Rob Williams' knowing direction, hit all of the right notes.  As Graham, Steve Callahan has lived his closeted life simultaneously cautiously and recklessly.  Matthew Montgomery's Trey is appropriately condescending and judgmental, but his heart is always in the right place, even when his foot is in his mouth.  Role/Play is the story of their meeting and falling in love, despite infamous, and nationally-publicized, obstacles.

They are supported excellently by David Pevsner, Brian Nolan and Matthew Stephen Herrick.  Jim J. Bullock has a quirky, hilarious star-turn as Graham's over-the-top agent.

In the past I have enjoyed Rob Williams other movies like ""Back Soon"" and ""Long-Term Relationship."" I wish I could say the same for ""Role/Play."" While the concept for the film sounds fine on paper, the execution fell flat. It had nothing to do with the two leads, Montgomery and Steve Callahan, who had wonderful chemistry, but everything to do with the script.

Normally in a Rob Williams' film we have a lot of diverse characters, including roles played by women. In ""Role/Play"" it seemed more like a two-man play rather than ensemble movie. Now David Pevsner shined as the innkeeper/mentor, but with no other strong secondary characters like in ""Back Soon"" (Bret Wolfe, Maggie McCollester) or ""Long-Term Relationship"" (Artie O'Daly, Chuti Tiu) the film was left to Montgomery and Callahan to carry. While their on-screen chemistry sizzled, the dialog was long-winded, preachy and at times utterly boring. It would have played perfectly on stage, but for film it just made the movie drag.

I won't even get into the improbability of two people meeting on vacation and falling instantly in love and willing to throw away their careers just to be together, as normally I am the biggest romantic on the planet and love a storyline like that; however I just couldn't buy it in ""Role/Play.""

I'd love to see Matthew and his partner Steve do another film together, but this film will not be staying in my movie library, which is a shame as I have watched and re-watched ""Back Soon"" so many times, and recommended it to friends.
