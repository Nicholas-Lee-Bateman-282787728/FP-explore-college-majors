873478,5,6304432712,"If you only ever own just one Keeping up appearances tape, make it this one!
This tape contains the number one (in my humble opinion) episode of all time....The QE11 Special episode. This one holds a special place in my heart as I used to work on board this ship. I received a letter from Geoffrey Hughes (Onslow), in which he said that this episode was the favorite of the cast as they actually got to travel up the coast of Norway on board the ship.
This episode is an hour long special and will have you rolling on the floor!
In 'Hyacinth tees off', Hyacinth turns to a 'CHUCKER' of golf to impress a Frozen food king.
I own all the KUA tapes but this one is top of my list.",972172800,15,677,4.136363636363637
873479,5,6304432712,"Yet another 'Keeping up appearances' gem to add to my library. Three classic episodes, Violets country cottage, Driving Mrs. Fortescue, Country estate sale. You've heard about Hyacinth's sister with ""room for a pony"", now you get to see Violet's estate when Hyacinth borrows her house for an indoor/outdoor BBQ. This is one of my all time favorite episodes and I was so happy to find it in this collection.
Driving Mrs. Fortescue shows the only scenes of Hyacinth in a pub! Not the kind of place one would expect to be found when you are active in higher social circles.
The County estate episode was not one of my favorite episodes until I happened to watch it a few more times on this tape and I began to notice discreet incidences which had me in tears of laughter.
If you are a Keeping up appearances fan, this tape is a must for your collection.",972172800,26,850,4.525974025974026
873480,5,6304432712,"Keeping Up Appearances is hilarious. Anyone who likes British Comedy would absolutely love KUA. Even if you aren't a big British Comedy fan, you cant resist Hyacinth and her colorful family! Hopefully all episodes will be  available to buy. (hint hint) :)",960854400,2,255,5.071428571428571
873481,5,6304432712,"No matter how many times I watch Hyacinth Bucket  on these videos or PBS, it makes me smile.  This is right up there with Fawlty Towers and Are You Being Served on the fun meter. Only one thing would be better, for Amazon  to offer the rest of the series episodes.  PLEASE!",957484800,8,273,4.1923076923076925
873482,5,6304432712,"Along with ""Chef"" and ""Waiting for God"",this is indeed one of Britain's better sitcoms. A tour de force for Patricia Routledge, who's Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet)is one of TV's better fleshed out characters. Check Routledge out in a non-comedic role in Hetty Wainthrope to  really appreciate her comic turn in ""Appearances."" One of the  best episodes (to my knowledge) has never aired on American TV, but is  shown aboard the QE2 and chronicles Hyacinth and Richard's much ballyhooed  cruise aboard the legendary ocean liner. One catch, Daisy and Onslow have  won a free cruise and are along for the ride much to Hyacinth's chagrin.  And Onslow wears a tuxedo! Plenty of misadventures for Hyacinth and  company. A must see for any serious Anglophile.  As much as I enjoy  Britcoms and British dramas, I must point out that the Brits have plenty of  inane TV as the Americans do,if not more. On this side of the pond we see  only the best of British TV - and their best rivals ours. No offense to the  other reviewers, but having spent much time in the UK, I hesitate to  denigrate American TV. Let's not forget such ingenious American gems as  Barney Miller, Night Court, Taxi and Seinfeld to name a few.
If you  haven't watched ""Appearances"" on PBS, then by all means buy the  videos as you will watch them over and over.",957225600,2,1330,4.692640692640692
873483,5,6304432712,"I don't understand why US television can't get things right.  For every show like The Simpsons we've got ten Full Houses, Home Improvements, or the like.  This is one show that gets it right.  Americans may not get it right  away as we are not so hung up on social pretenses(or are not as aware of  it).  No precocious kids, no one-liners.  Patricia Routledge is so  brilliant as Hyacinth that you truly want to throttle her.  The plot always  consists of a comedy of errors concerning a middle class wannabe socialite  trying to climb up the ranks while avoiding her common kinfolk.  Every  thing that happens is so impossible and ridiculous but so much more  plausible than the plots that US sitcoms give us. There are things I will  never understand though.  Everyone is so afraid of Hyacinth and never  stands up to her.  Must be a British thing.  Some of the jokes get worn out  fairly quickly as well.  The characters repeat themselves so much as if you  didn't hear them the first time.  Especially Rose and her ramblings on her  latest male acquisitions. Despite these flaws Keeping Up Appearances is a  breath of fresh air.  Praise PBS for sending us lowly colonists our weekly  episodes. Why doesn't Elizabeth's husband ever show up?  I don't get to see  ALL the episodes.",922492800,,1282,4.648648648648648

Of course I still like it but I did knock off one star due to being mislead.  This has the Seaside Fun episode which is just about my all time favorite episode.

I love Onslow and Daisy, and Rose always looks like she just came home from a 1981 Rod Stewart concert (in a good way, I mean).  Sometimes I notice that I'm 'white knuckling' the arms of my chair when I'm watching this.

WAY too many commercials and background data preceding the actual comedy show, AND these nuisances could NOT be eliminated by fast forward or jumping ahead. Nope, you had to wait through up to 10 minutes or more of fluff that had nothing to do with the program you intended to watch. In all my purchases of DVD's, these were the absolute WORST for navigating and eliminating that which you did not want to view. I sold these to a local CD Warehouse.

As soon as I saw the entrance and the sign saying Walton Hall Hotel, I knew that I had been there.  I was fortunate to have spent a week there many years ago.

874875,5,6304432712,"DECK THE HALLS WITH HYACINTH is one of the most confusing DVDs I have ever encountered, therefore I have decided to generate a detailed analysis of it and share the results, with you...

1.  A VERY MERRY HYACINTH (29:16) (AKA: THE FATHER CHRISTMAS SUIT)
Original Airdate: December 25, 1991
Richard is supposed to dress as Father Christmas to distribute gifts to ""the old folks"" at the church, but after Emmet gets him drunk, things go totally askew.

2.  SEA FEVER (58:05)
Original Airdate: December 26, 1993
Although this is one of the best episodes of Keeping Up Appearances ever, definitely in the top 5, the original airdate is the only thing that indicates that it ever had anything to do with Christmas. It had to have been filmed months before Christmas time as there isn't one decoration up anywhere on the QE2. But that's completely OK as there is an extensive (although hurried) tour of this beautiful cruise ship, making it a fascinating, wonderful, and hilarious episode.

3.  ANGEL GABRIEL BLUE (48:20)
Original Airdate: December 25, 1994
Daisy's red and green hair ribbons, and a little Santa in Onslo and Daisy's living room, have more to do with Christmas than anything else in this episode.  Even the title has nothing to do with Christmas.  That's OK, because it includes one of the all time best Coffee with Hyacinth scenes ever.  And, yes, Trevor Bannister (Mr. Lucas from ""Are You Being Served"") does a great job as the salesman.

4.  THE PAGEANT (29:10)
Original Airdate: December 25, 1995
This one is all to do about Hyacinth wanting desperately to put on a Historic Pageant about a local civil war in the 1600s with Hyacinth playing the Queen, of course.  When none of the volunteers show up, she recruits her entire family, including constantly arguing Violet and Bruce, Rose in a cat fight with one of her boyfriend's wives, Daddy and his new friend, and of course, Elizabeth and Emmet.  Again, nothing really to do with Christmas... Not complaining, just trying to clear up the particulars on this DVD.

It is Extremely Interesting to note that Season 4 actually ended with ""Sea Fever"" (Dec 26, 1993), and then AN ENTIRE YEAR LATER ""Angel Gabriel Blue"" (Dec 25, 1994) was the ONLY EPISODE FILMED IN 1994!!  Season 5 began on Sept 3, 1995!!!

""The Pageant"" however, ended Season 5 normally, and was sadly the very last episode of Keeping Up Appearances.

As the producer of Keeping Up Appearances stated in the PBS Documentary ""Behind The Britcoms"" it is truly sad when a show ends with no closure.  For many of the Britcoms the writers are given the opportunity to create a wonderful ending, which is a tribute to the cast, and a satisfaction for the audience.  But although they had more ideas and things they wanted to do with Hyacinth and family, Patricia Rutledge just suddenly decided she didn't want to do it any more, and there you are.  It's finished.

I tell you right now, the Best way to end your complete viewing experience of Keeping Up Appearances then, is on the QE2 with the ""Sea Fever"" episode on this DVD.  I won't tell you what happens at the very end, but nothing (to me) leaves a better, warmer, happier feeling (with no bitter after taste), than the ending of this one.  It is a true Gem.",1324512000,16,3237,4.6902654867256635
874876,3,6304432712,"One need only watch one episode and then has seen them all.  Predictable, annoying characters.

I had the idea on looking for the British sitcoms on DVD, but was worried I couldn't find them. I looked on Amazon, and there they were.

875075,5,6304432712,"In this gem Our Hyacinth unleashes her considerable operatic powless upon us and all I can say is God Save the Queen.  This grouping contains among other things Our Hyacinth trying like heck to land a major part in Emmits play ""The Boyfriend"".  Our Hyacinth's comedic timing is flawless throughout this masterpiece of brit com.  The most wonderful abet chilling moment in the one of the selections comes when Our Hyacinth stays a few minutes to put a few beautiful young ladies through their paces.  Hyacinth is at first lecturing the good ladies  in word and finally by searing painful example of with her amazingly tedious and time worn vocal instrument.  The results are without a doubt hallarious as her voice thunders through the church hall driving everyone within earshot into deep cover.  Fade in to another location to find, the Vicar of the parish, Richard, the Vicars good lady wife and two or three fine ladies in 20's flapper attire couched beneath an old church hall stage.  What totally kills me is how everyone is gone and Hyacinth is oblious to their departure still giving pointers to ladies long since gone.  And what advice she gives.  Hyacinth says, and Ladies Notice my diction, its so important that the audience hear the words!  The other thing is aweful as her voice is it carries like a fog horn on a still night.

Meanwhile Our Hyacinth as usual in totally oblivious self absorbed blissful glee continues to completion her rendition of the lead song ""The called Boyfriend"".  What makes this scene of Hyacinth singing the Boyfriend so terribly funny is how convincing she is making you see she is deadly serious in thinking her voice represents nothing but the absolute height of professional quality in every way.  That is the MAGic of Hyacinth Bucket.  If we the audience thought for just one second Hyacinth did not have absolute faith in her every ability the jokes would fall flat.  It is Hyacinth's indomitable faith that her every word is right, her instincts regards the finer things in life and the social graces will always be unerringly right that makes her so funny special and without peer.

Another weird fact.  I heard Patricia Routledge sing for real in another series where she played a older detective sort of like a more jazzy up to date Mrs. Marple.  In fact Patricia Routledge has a wonderful voice and she can sing too, I was impressed.  They say that to really know how to sound bad when you sing you have to be blessed with a good singing voice and knowledge of how to use it.  Trust me Patricia Routledge wins on both counts she has a terrific singing voice in real life and she obviously has a deep enough understanding of how to sing properly to really mangle every possible rule of good singing to death as Our Hyacinth.  The Boyfriend is Patricia Routledge's tour de force as Our Hyacinth, this is her master work not to be eclipsed.  If you do not buy this copy of Keeping Up Appearances you do yourself a shockingly criminal neglect.  You will not and never will be the full and well rounded culturally effeat icon of social moral and political rectitude our Hyacinth wanted you to be without this as part of your Keeping Up Appearances collection.

This is a MUST have group of episodes for any fan of Our Hyacinth Bucket.  I would certainly buy this grouping of Keeping Up Appearances episodes for to hear Hyacinth singing Boyfriend by itself.  The Boyfiend episode is not in the boxed set so if you want to squirm in your seat to the sounds of Hyacinth butchering I mean singing ""The Boyfriend"" you simply must buy this DVD set.  I only givw thia episode five stars because, I can not give it one billion.  Anyway go buy this DVD so you too can laugh yourself silly.  Make sure if you watch this episode you do not take high tea with your Royal Delton, with the blue perrywinkles painted on.  If you are having your high tea while watching the boyfriend you want to be drinking from a plain beaker \ cup hopefully one of Daisy's finest.

Ok go buy it now!",1145404800,12,4015,4.60337552742616
875076,4,6304432712,"Excellent show. Hyacinth is always trying to ""impress others with her social standing"" she is constantly being frustrated by her sister's family and their ""lower class"" shenanigans.

875077,5,6304432712,"I remember the first time I saw ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and incorrectly thought, with the bouncy title music, incessant laugh track, and the perpetually frustrated shenanigans of the main character Hyacinth Bucket, that I was watching a comedy. Boy, was I wrong.

This particular DVD contains the first six episodes of the fifth and final season, with a total runtime of 3 hours, as well as an interview with the stars Patricia Routledge and Clive Smith, outtakes, and biographies. All good stuff and highly entertaining, at first.

As an American of the U.S. variety, I have never experienced the strictures of the British class system, and did not realize that it was still in powerful effect to this day. Of course, social classes exist in the U.S. as well, but not to the historically rooted or culturally pervasive extent I imagine it to be in Britain. This class system provides both the context and subtext to the ""Keeping Up Appearances"" series. Each episode involves a new scheme by Hyacinth to improve her social standing, which is the context. The subtext, however, comes from her deep-seated feelings of inferiority and lack of identity resulting from the oppressiveness of the class system. After coming to this realization, I began to see Hyacinth's desperate and futile attempts to strive for an imagined ideal of social respectability as lamentable and deeply sad. So sad, in fact, that I can no longer watch an episode of ""Keeping Up Appearances"" without becoming horribly depressed and lachrymose. Still I watch, however, because although the spectacle is indeed pitiable and pathetic, it is also strangely moving. I am not sure why watching a middle-class British woman's laughably vain attempts at respectability should cause such profound stirrings in my psyche--perhaps I too am caught in a desperate and doomed struggle of my own design--but I somehow find the whole spectacle deeply edifying.

Perhaps I have not thought deeply enough about Hyacinth's answer to the existential prison of her own delusions.  Maybe her social climbing and complete obliviousness to her own absurdity bespeak not foolish ignorance, but a noble futility, a la Don Quixote.  If so, then her faithful helpmate and hapless husband Richard must serve in the Sancho Panza role as the steady and sensible comic foil.  Seen in this light, Hyacinth and ""Keeping Up Appearances"" represent a true flowering (ha ha) of British television.",1130544000,10,2432,5.128787878787879
875108,4,6304432712,"This special holiday DVD of Keeping Up Appearances includes double length episodes that I do not think I've ever seen aired on my public broadcasting station.  ""Sea Fever"" features Hyacinth and Richard on the famous QE2. Unbeknownst to Hyacinth, Onslow and Daisy win a contest to spend a cruise on the QE2 as VIP guests, enjoying all the things Hyacinth feels entitled to.  When Hyacinth spots them, she assumes they must be stowaways and, with the reluctant but obedient Richard in tow, races around the ship to find them so she can protect them (well, Daisy at least) from the authorities.  Viewers get to tour the ship with Hyacinth!

The other double length special also includes a treat.  ""Angel Gabriel Blue"" does not really have a holiday atmosphere, but fans of Are You Being Served? will no doubt recognize Trevor Bannister who played the role of the popular Mr. Lucas.  A Bannister bio is also available in Hyacinth's guest book on the disc.

The most Christmasy episode is ""A Very Merry Hyacinth"" where Richard, dressed like Father Christmas, gets drunk with Emmet and Elizabeth must take Richard's place as Father Christmas without Hyacinth knowing.  The other episode is ""Historical Pageant.""  The DVD includes monologues of Patricia Routledge's Kitty character from ""Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV"" from the early/mid 1980s. Her jokes are veeeery British and I can't comprehend 3/4 of them, but the character was definitely a precursor to Hyacinth Bucket.  Cast bios are also included.

For those who would just like the holiday specials, this DVD is a great buy.  If you are a big fan of the show, however, I highly recommend The Full Bouquet.  It has this DVD plus 7 others with all the episodes and lots of extras.",1104451200,74,1729,4.860068259385666
875109,4,6304432712,"As usual, Hyacinth is hilarious. Fantastic cast, great script. One thing is missing though. There is NO ""FUNNY WOMAN"" documentary about Patricia Routledge on the DVD as said in the online-description. There are only the 5 Kitty monologues and cast bio!! Plus all the US DVD(zone 1) have no subtitle like the UK (zone 2) ones.",1083801600,10,325,4.821428571428571

875114,5,6304432712,"This particular video rises to the same level of humor I have come to expect from Keeping Up Appearances. Patricia Routledge, in fledgling episodes of this series, gives a stellar performance as the social-conscious Hyacinth Bucket. In ""Daddy's Fondness for Dairy Products,"" Daddy has once again met with an unfortunate turn of events, this time while bicycling in the altogether. The hospital scenes where Hyacinth demands to see the ""extent"" of his injuries had me rolling on the floor laughing.
In ""Welcoming the Dishy Vicar,"" we get to see the first Rose and her affinity for the new vicar. Hyacinth has invited the vicar and his missus for tea, and Rose appears with Daisy and Onslow, only to ""dash"" the vicar away for her own whims! Hyacinth is beside herself, but manages to salvage the day, and her reputation.
In ""Visitin An Acquaintance's Stately Home,"" we get to hear Richard at his English best, talking about the lorry and the dual carriageway. And is that Daddy in his Captain Midnight costume? Goodness, what's he up to now?
I miss seeing Emmett in these episodes, but Elizabeth definitely holds her won. And we hear a little background about where her elisive husband is and why she shares a place with her brother.
Overall worthwhile purchase. I've watched it often.",1012435200,19,1283,4.889908256880734
875115,3,6304432712,"I bought this video for my Mom, who has watched the show for years.  I thought the first shows ever would make her happy.  But not all the cast members were in place........it's very funny...and I've watched it many times.  This year....maybe I buy her a newer model.  David Lloyd",1007164800,3,280,4.54
875116,5,6304432712,"One of the reasons that I purchased this video was because I have family from England and so I can relate to British humor very well. When my husband and I saw ""Keeping Up Appearances"" on T.V., we quickly became hooked and it became a weekend ritual.
We loved all the characters; the next-door neighbors Elizabeth and Emmet, who must endure the constant invitations to tea and candlelight suppers. Hyacinth's brother-in-law Onslow, sister Daisy, and adventurous Rose, all of whom she denies out in public any relation to, and her sister Violet, ""You know, the one with the Mercedes, sauna and room for a pony?"" And Violet's obscure husband George, who appearantly fancies wearing women's clothing. Then there's poor Richard, Hyacinth's ""compliant"" and ""subdued"" husband, whom everyone constantly asks ""How do you ever manage it?"", referring to having a wife such as Hyacinth.
It was in this video, that my husband and I learned the true pronunciation of Hyacinth's last name, which in all reality is pronounced ""Bucket"" and not ""Bouquet"". Richard in a rare state of outspokeness, reminds Hyacinth that his name was always ""Bucket"" until he married her. However in order to upscale all of her aquaintances and friends, she must have a name that fits with her imagined high social status.
I would recommend this video to anyone who loves comedy. It is a breath of fresh air that doesn't need inappropriate language or behavior in order to be hilariously funny.",976320000,12,1458,4.979508196721311
