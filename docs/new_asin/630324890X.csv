7841848,1,630324890X,Kind of ridiculous. Shawn Weatherly at no point in this movie resembles a man. Pretty stupid and not worth the buy,1458172800,,114,4.476190476190476
7841849,5,630324890X,Too bad that someone has not put this VHS on DVD...of course the technology is decades old.  It is loads of fun/funny and the plot is ritetous and all works out in the end.  Maybe someone will do a remake.,1412208000,,205,4.1

7841851,5,630324890X,"I was fortunate enough to pick up a copy of this film, mainly because I was intrigued to see Shawn Weatherly in an acting role other than her best known part in NBC's first season of Baywatch. It was surprisingly very funny and although there was a hint of nudity coming from Ms Weatherly, this is still a great film that you could watch with your family. There are lots of whacky stunts, much craziness and a few cowboys, punch-ups, crocodiles and hostile savages thrown in for good measure. It all adds up to a fast paced entertaining piece of viewing that I for one would highly recommend! Cast includes - Michael Nouri, Lee Van Cleef, Shawn Weatherly, Craig Gardner, Liz Torres and John Hussey.",1039478400,6,698,4.592
