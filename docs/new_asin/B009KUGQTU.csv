5345596,2,B009KUGQTU,"There was not much in the way of a plot.  There is only one thing that I could say to spoil it, so I won't.  Low budget, no name actors and it shows/  I guess this is what happens when you make wimps vampires??  Artsy disconnectedness throughout the whole film.  Maybe if they have more footage and a re-edit it could be saved.  I don't mind when the usual vampire rules are non-existent, but coupled with a plotless disconnected film, I wouldn't waste my time unless you have seen just about every other vampire movie there is.
The only good part was the last 15 seconds when......

5345598,1,B009KUGQTU,"After reading Alan Smithee's excellent review, I ordered and eagerly looked forward to seeing this film.
Alas, I was stunned by the very poor sound quality and frustrated that subtitles weren't offered to compensate for the terrible sound.
Fortunately the dialogue wasn't very essential for the first part of the movie, but I got so stressed out trying to understand even the minimal dialogue that I had to quit watching.
Also, due to the main characters' careless disregard for the value of their drug of choice, I was unable to maintain a sense of disbelief.  It was  like watching other types of addicts using cocaine or heroine to create etch-a-sketch type drawings.",1434499200,5,670,4.973214285714286
5345599,5,B009KUGQTU,"Vampires are sexy. This is the new paradigm of the world of contemporary horror fiction. We no longer live in a world where vampires are vicious monsters who want nothing more than to suck our blood--rather, our world is one where vampires crave love, experience lust, and...still want to suck our blood. Critics may wail and moan about this new turn in vampire lore, but the appeal and potential dimensions which the ""vampires-are-sexy"" trend has to offer cannot be denied. In the best case scenario, we get movies like Hemo, a little-known indie horror gem from 2010, which takes this common twist in vampire lore, adds a few fresh ones to the mix, and serves it up in a film which is scary, sexy, smart and very entertaining.

Hemo is the story of a group of modern-day vampires who, after being turned away from local blood banks, are forced to resort to murder in order to get their fix. That's all that should really be said about the movie, because to say any more would diminish the suspense and unique quality that this film has to offer. As can be seen, though, this is a vampire film with more dimension than is typically expected of the genre today. Vampirism is treated as a drug addiction more than it is a dietary necessity, which adds a depth and realism to it, and it often echoes shades of popular drug films from decades past, such as Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream. In addition, a moral weight is added to the story by presenting it from the perspective of vampires who do not want to kill for blood, being forced into doing so by unfortunate circumstances beyond their control. There is more depth and heart to this film for those reasons alone than most vampire movies get out of merely adding a little sex appeal to their sharp-toothed antagonists. In addition, the film has a unique visual style, playing with color and lighting as tools of mood and content, and using a mobile, expressive camera to portray shades of emotional content as opposed to merely showing a narrative. The picture is a little jittery in places--a consequence of shooting on a low budget--but that does nothing to diminish the effort, talent, and artistry that went into this production.

The acting and writing in the film are surprisingly very good. Pamela Price, who plays Felicia, is a talented and appealing young actress who balances a subtle performance with a dark, unconventional sex appeal, and Steve Dash (who you may remember from Friday the 13th Part 2,) shines as the friendly neighbor who unwittingly pushes the protagonists onwards towards their eventual downfall. The director, Bob Freville, is new in the industry (Hemo is the first feature-length production for which he has a director's credit,) but he is technically accomplished and aware of the subtler elements of atmosphere, tone and aesthetic which really add life to this film. This is a fantastic example of a low-budget film done right.

Beyond the feature itself, the DVD is a very well-made and full-featured release, typical of Troma's home video output. In addition to a hilarious intro by Lloyd Kaufman (in which he uses the similarity of the title to the word ""homo"" as a way to show his support for gay rights, even if it's presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner,) and some excellent menu designs which are clean and easy to navigate, the disc comes packed with interesting and worthwhile special features. Among the special features on the disc are trailers, a ""making-of"" documentary for the main feature, ""Of Bitches and Hounds"" (a short film by director Freville,) and behind-the-scenes content. It is an excellent package and provides a lot of added value beyond the film itself.

In conclusion, Hemo is a unique and unexpectedly deep take on the vampire film in a contemporary setting. With a unique, dark atmosphere and numerous dimensions of moral consequence and emotional weight, it really took me by surprise, and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Check it out.",1372291200,6,3966,4.819383259911894
