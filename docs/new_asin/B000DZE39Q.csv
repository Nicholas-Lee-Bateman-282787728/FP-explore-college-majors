8102989,3,B000DZE39Q,"""Yeah!~ Yeah!~ Yeah!~"" is the begining of an old Beatles' song... YEAH; YEAH; YEAH...
I know that these 8 DVD-Rs contain 40 [not so perfect] dupes of The ' Stooges. I needed
something for a [new] fan----here in Germany----that is region-free. This will do HIM fine,
and it won't cost ME much.
Certainly, the Columbia/Sony [authorized] complete set is T=H=E only way to get ALL of
the theatrical shorts... digitally-remastered.
But, you GET what you GOT... I got this for a friend, and own the DELUXE set, for myself!",1463875200,,516,4.808988764044944
8102990,3,B000DZE39Q,"I bought one of these sets. Yes, packaging is pathetic. The DVDs themselves are Very Poor. Constant lockups, fuzzy.
As a plus, Sony sucks for not allowing us to buy quality versions of these.
In a nutshell, put up with the crap quality and be glad to see some gems we may not see again in our lifetimes (unless Sony wakes up!).",1213833600,,327,4.290322580645161
8102991,5,B000DZE39Q,This 3 Stooge DVD collection has all of the best episodes I enjoy the most! I've been a Stoogeaholic for over 45 years and this has all the greats....EXCELLENT!,1200009600,,160,4.551724137931035
8102992,5,B000DZE39Q,I purchased this for the same person that I purchased the first set for...he loved both sets!  He is a huge Three Stooges fan...and has planned on watching them over and over again!,1175126400,,181,4.484848484848484
8102993,4,B000DZE39Q,"This is Vol 2 of a five vol set. Vols 1&2 are all Curly shorts, but 17 of his are not included! Vols 3-5 are Shemp & Joe shorts, with 2 of Shemp's missing. The technical quality of Curly's are fine but Shemp's and Joe's are frequently very poor.

Additionally, 5 shorts from Vol 3 are repeated on Vol 4 and 9 on Vol 5, and the labelling is pretty poor, with lots of speling mistooks!

Overall, this set is reasonable for the price but unsatisfying for the purist.",1173484800,,463,4.191011235955056
8102994,5,B000DZE39Q,"Ok, so the packaging is not the greatest, that is certainly true.  But, I have never yet bought films to spend much time looking at their packaging!  These are the classic short programs--and all very funny.  The picture resolution and sound is as about as good as I would expect, maybe not great, but certainly not bootleg, and meets all my expectations.  If you are after a set of Stooges CD's at a reasonable price--especially for your kids, this set is a very nice choice.  (I have not yet viewed all of the CD's in this set, but I have yet to see Shemp).",1147392000,4,559,4.336538461538462
8102995,1,B000DZE39Q,"Don't buy this dodgy waste of money!!! Not only does the seller claim it is legit, but the episodes are not in any kind of order! Since Sony will probably not release all the episodes, you may be tempted to buy bootlegs. Don't get this one, however! There are sets with all 190, in order with the same sound & picture quality as this one. Sony does NOT lease any of the episodes out, except to television! Only four are in the public domain, and they ain't here!!!",1145577600,5,464,4.284090909090909
8102996,1,B000DZE39Q,"The discs in this collection are not even DVD, they're DVD-R or DVD-RW or something.  Look at the DVD logo.  It's actually a backwards D with VD written next to it, and underneath it is a white oval with ""video"" printed underneath of it.  To make things worse, the discs were scratched.  I did get a good laugh out of reading the copyright on the back, though.",1141603200,9,360,4.3283582089552235
8102997,5,B000DZE39Q,"Still no Shemp to be found in here. In Vol. 2, there are 40 more great CURLY shorts. I hope they come out with a Volume 3.",1137888000,,122,3.5555555555555554
