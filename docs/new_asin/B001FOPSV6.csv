8302184,1,B001FOPSV6,"What can I say - a documentary from an organization that has only compassion for Israel's most radical enemies. Don't watch unless you want PA propaganda reminiscent of ""Der Ewige Jude"". Also doesn't aknowledge the centrality of Hebron in the Jewish religion. Btselem (Amalek) should be ashamed!",1341360000,2,295,5.297872340425532
8302185,1,B001FOPSV6,"Unfortunately, a person may not be able to play this DVD which depicts the changes in the city of Hebron ""from a bustling city center to a Ghost town"" as it will not play in your DVD player. I have two different DVDs players which, between the two, play almost every DVD I have ever purchased (which is close to a thousand). But this DVD does not tell you what region it will play in so you are just taking a chance when you order it. So I am stuck with a documentary on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict that I cannot play.",1236470400,,523,4.188118811881188
