1840259,4,B00008DDVR,"The Lotte Berke Method is a non-traditional type of toning developed by a dancer of the same name. It supposedly focuses on the creation of long, lean (not bulky) muscles through the use of small, precise movements, and it has inspired similar methods such as Callanetics. A hallmark of this method is that stretching is included throughout the workout rather than just the at the beginning and the end; the emphasis is on shaping muscles through both strength AND stretch.

In BASIC ESSENTIALS, the focus is on whole-body toning. The workout begins with a warm-up common to all 4 Lotte Berk videos: a type of high-legged marching in place followed by simple stretches. Then it's on to the floor to work the arms via several sets of Lotte Berk push-ups--they're tougher than they look! Standing work with a ballet barre (a high backed chair or even a wall can be substituted) comes next. You start with ballet-type squats done utilizing the ""Lotte Berk tuck"" position and the move on to leg kicks for the buttocks. These are tiny movements that only LOOK easy; they really target the thighs and glutes. Following this, it's back to the floor for abs work. This is the one part of the video that I found to be a bit disappointing; although the moves were definitely challenging, I felt it in my back more than in my abdominal area. The workout ends with the Lotte Berk ""knee dancing"" move that is pictured on the cover of the video--a signature move which provides further thigh work--as well as a ""shape by stretch"" section.

BASIC ESSENTIALS is led by three Lotte Berk certified instructors. The main instructor, Stephanie, comes off a little condescending in her comments (eg, repeatedly saying things like ""where did you feel that?""), but she provides good cueing during the workout. The remaining two instructors do not speak, but one shows modifications. The Lotte Berk Method is great for all exercisers who are looking for a different but challenging strength workout, including those at a beginning level, and this tape would be particularly helpful for those looking to tone up the stubborn areas of the lower body. Overall, I'd rate it as 3 1/2 stars for a good workout with an instructor who can be annoying at times.",1110844800,15,2228,4.799479166666667
1840260,5,B00008DDVR,"After using the tapes only twice a week for a little over 2 months, people at work started asking me what I was doing differently to lose weight so fast.  I had to tell them it was Lotte Berk's tapes.  I'd only lost 6 pounds but was down a full pant size.  The instructors can seem annoying, but not nearly as bad as some other exercise tapes I've tried over the years.

The tapes are about 25 minutes each.  I like the fact that the instructor reminds you to maintain your form.  Each muscle used is then stretched, helping almost eliminate soreness the next day. To get results, in under 1/2 hour of working out, is my idea of a wonderful workout.",1109030400,35,649,4.278688524590164
1840261,2,B00008DDVR,"I don't know how anyone can get into these work-outs.  They are STRANGE.  I wanted to punch the instructor in the nose. Her voice and cheesy way she spoke is enough to drive you bonkers.  And the way she opens her eyes all wide and says ""Do you remember? Where do you feel it? Can you do it? Can you tuck??Yes you feel it!""
The newage porno sounding music combined with the strange hypno gucci girl ballerinas was wacky. I'll stick with The Firm.",1108598400,9,446,4.285714285714286
1840262,4,B00008DDVR,"I decided to try Lotte Berk because I needed a low-impact shape-up to complement weekly ballet classes.  This isn't a bad way to start; it resembles ballet, yoga, and Pilates.  The Lotte Berk Method relies more on holding muscle contractions than on endless reps of a move, and in that respect it can be challenging.  Although I didn't feel anything in my abs the next day, I will say that my thighs were extremely sore; however, this may have been because I did the bonus ""Blast"" workout directly after finishing the main one.  The main problem I have with this video is that Stephanie, the instructor, talks WAY too much.  Midway through the video I was yelling at the TV to just shut up and get on with the workout already!  Also, what's with the ""rich-women-browse-high-end-boutiques"" opening?  Still, this wasn't a bad workout and it doesn't take too much time, which is definitely a point in its favor.",1085270400,16,908,4.708860759493671
1840263,1,B00008DDVR,"The instructor is very irritating. She does not make it fun and she is militaristic. I tried it once and couldn't stand it for more than a few minutes. Maybe this method is good with a different instructor or for you if you like the tough stuff. She's kind of creepy the way she stares at the camera. I put it away and tried it again later, but it still didn't work for me. It's in my reject pile. You'd be better off with a Karen Voight or the 8 min As Seen On TV Set.

1840264,4,B00008DDVR,"I did the Basic Essentials this morning before work and I was shakey for the walk to work! I really love the fact that the workout was only 30 minutes long. It really did fly by. Can't wait to try out the other three in the set. The only reason I don't give 4 stars is b/c the instuctor, Stephanie I think, is so annoying I almost had to hit mute.",1067558400,10,347,3.9014084507042255
1840265,5,B00008DDVR,"I gave this DVD 5 stars, because it is a great introduction to the Lotte Berk Method.  It begins with the usual 9-minute warm-up...Knee-lifts, shoulder rolls with pelvic tuck, upper body strengthening, and stretching...The first part of the workout focuses on the lower body using isometric exercises at the barre (A sturdy piece of furniture works just fine.) and then on the floor.  The second part of the workout focuses on the abs using focused floor work...The cool down of the workout is ""Shape By Stretching"" where you stretch the worked parts of your body for elongated and shapely muscles.  This workout is appoximately 30 Minutes long.
I have the entire set of Lotte Berk on DVD.  This is the ""easiest"" workout, but definitely the best introduction to Lotte Berk Method.  The DVD comes with a special Blast workout...approximately 9 minutes long, and a definite intensity boost.  The fact that this is a solid workout, great introduction, and has an increased intensity bonus workout makes me give this workout 5 stars.  Plus the fact that this method is amazingly effective.  I've seen the results!  I truly hope you'll invest in this series.  It shouldn't be missed!",1065916800,42,1178,4.964285714285714
1840316,2,B00008DDVR,"I know a lot of people wrote about the creepy and strange demenor of the lead instructor and I would have to add my voice to that.

About the instructor: She was wierd and creepy always staring into the camera and and sqinting her eyes to inflect more intensity at times.  Her tone of voice was very condesending and she doesn't explain the excerises very well.  She pretty much just says ""we are doing it perfect so just watch us to learn the proper form"".  But the problem is, it didn't ever show any good camera angles to see the form.

About the workout: Its ok but I think there are better ones.  There is not a lot of variety and most of the movements are not anything new or innovative.

I don't think I will be using this one much since there are so many others that are better.",1348963200,,786,4.2
1840317,5,B00008DDVR,"I really love this workout!! it gives you a great overall body workout with lots of stretching worked into it. Perfect for beginners of any discipline. And its so relaxing!! Not like those ""pump you up"" videos that try to get you moving and you just end up out of breath and its not so slow that you'll fall asleep. This is a great video for those who are just getting back into the swing of things and need something that's easy to follow and that you actually WANT to add to your daily routine. I would definitely suggest this to anyone!! So buy with confidence and enjoy!!",1343692800,6,575,4.333333333333333
1840318,5,B00008DDVR,"I haven't been exercising in many years.  Recently I started again because I noticed my muscles were getting creaky.

In the past, I experimented with a lot of different exercise regimes.  The worst for me was weight lifting.  Unlike the women in the videos, weight lifting didn't make me thin, it bulked me out. My legs were huge, my shoulders were huge etc. etc.  The best exercises for me were in my dance classes and videos with dance background.

Lotte Berk's method was created by a dancer as an extra to help other dancers to strengthen and lengthen muscles.

This video and the rest in the series are geared towards beginners.  The instructors are very attentive to form and careful in giving modification instructions for the exercises.  The workout is quick, no nonsense and annoyance free.  The instructors claim 10 sessions will help you feel better and in 20 you will see the results.  Personally I started seeing results by the 3rd to 5th session.  However I'm not sure if that result would be the same for all or it is just a matter of my body snapping back to dance form.

These exercises are very isometric.  You need to pay attention to form and muscle feel.  It would be extremely easy to just do the work but not feel anything or get a workout.  Perhaps that is what accounts for the different impressions of this series.  If you have any dance training at all, the exercises will be familiar and you will know what to aim for in the workout.  It can and does leave others in the dark.

Unfortunately Lydia Bach, who refined these exercises from Lotte Berk herself, has retired.  So I don't think we will get more videos then this video and the rest of the set.  I hope they create more.",1343433600,2,1707,4.5130718954248366
1840319,1,B00008DDVR,I hated this work out DVD. I didn't feel any sort of work out from it what so ever. It irritated me more than anything.,1294272000,,119,3.8
1840320,5,B00008DDVR,"I have been doing intermediate pilates & yoga DVDs as my main form of exercise for about 5 years.  I decided I needed something new to lose 5-10 pounds, so I turned to the LB Method.  I have been doing this Basic Essentials DVD every other day for almost 20 days, and it delivers the results it promises.  I've lost a solid 4 pounds of fat so far.  My waist is noticeably thinner, and I finally have that hourglass look.  I found that with pilates I could get a flat stomach quickly, but missed that curvy waist LB is able to sculpt.  My thighs were pretty muscular to begin with, but LB has helped to build more lean muscle & burn the fat off.  I'm looking forward to really shaping up my thighs with the advanced LB DVDs.  Last week I bought some 28 size pants in my favorite brand, and I have been a solid 29 for at least 5 years!  Dude, this workout is no joke.  I also like it b/c you get serious burn, but don't feel exhausted afterwards.

My only criticism is that I'd like some more arm exercises in the workout, but I can still use my pilates moves to get those biceps bulging.

I noticed some other reviewers weren't into the instructors' style.  I just wanted to say that I am totally into it.  The main instructor makes me smile b/c she's so intense without being screamy or fake.  I suppose in the end, everyone likes different things, but my vote is a YES for these wild-haired ladies.  I feel right at home working out with them :)",1294185600,9,1446,4.2226277372262775
1840321,5,B00008DDVR,"I purchased this to get back into exercise. I love that it is one that you can actually do as a beginner, and you can feel it working when you use it. It doesn't make you too sore the next day, which I always dread when just starting an excercise program. You do feel the areas you worked out, but not to where you feel like you can't move the next day. It is also easy to follow, as I am not good at following most exercise dvds. Alot of them have you so busy trying to figure out the moves, you can't keep up with the program. Definitely recommend!",1246147200,9,550,4.009090909090909
1840322,5,B00008DDVR,"Everyone can find 30 minutes, much of the movements can even be done while on the phone.  This can be done 30 minutes before the rest of the family is awake, or while away. It's a must to have this DVD.",1235433600,3,202,3.926829268292683
1840323,4,B00008DDVR,"This is a good foundation for the other workouts. Use this first to learn the basic moves. I wouldn't call this a ""cardio"" workout though. There is too much downtime in between sets because Stephanie does talk a lot. Once you learn the routine, just fast forward through her chatter. It is important to listen to her instructions to make sure you have the right form but once you have it down, skip to the actual set. I did break a sweat and I could feel the burn so I guess it works pretty well.",1229817600,2,496,4.231578947368421
1840324,4,B00008DDVR,"I had this DVD sitting on my shelf for a few years now.  I had tried it a few times and just never got hooked.  I've since started other exercise and with a bit more flexibility and core strength then I used to have, I decided to try Lotte Berk again.  It's definitely not something that will everyone will like.  You have to focus on what you're doing, the movements are small and precise, and you will feel a burn.  I will stick with Pilates and Yoga as my primary ""core"" and flexibility work but I'll start adding Lotte Burk back into the mix now too.",1223856000,,554,4.188679245283019
1840325,5,B00008DDVR,"I have noticed several reviewers upset about the way the instructor, Stephanie Lyons, comes across in this video.  I had 8 yrs of intensive ballet, and she reminds me very much of a strict ballet teacher, which must be why I like her.  She herself started ballet at age 3 and danced with the NY City Ballet.  The remarks she makes to draw one's attention to where the movement is felt, where it should be felt, are not meant to be condescending.  What she is trying to do is assist you in building the ""muscle memory"" of the correct form of the movement, so that when you have the movements memorized, and start doing them without the video, you will immediately know by the WAY IT FEELS whether you are doing them correctly.
  I thought this video was excellent with its instruction, as are all the LBM videos, although rather more beginner than ideal for my personal use.  I hope my commentary offers a fresh perspective on this particular instructor.",1220832000,16,953,4.570588235294117
1840336,4,B00008DDVR,"If you want a leg workout that centers on quads, buy this one.  Many people have already listed out the main points of this DVD.  Here's how I use mine:  skip the weird march-in-place warmup, start with section 2 (of 4):  thigh & seat.  In about 3 minutes, you get a screaming thigh workout that strengthens quads noticeably.  My knees are weak, and lunges are no good.  These plies get results without the joint instability risked when doing front lunges.  You really feel this workout, but when it ends, you're not sore.  The next hamstring/butt exercises are ok, but the positioning they ask for seems undoable by humans.  You still get noticeable results even if you're only in the ballpark position-wise.  I AVOID THE AB SECTION COMPLETELY because they make no modifications for people with neck problems.  Skip to the very end of this section for some more quad work, and I'm done.  This is about all I can take, because these ballerinas are VERY angry, but I keep coming back because the 10 minutes a day I spend with them is a faster, more effective leg workout than I get anywhere else.  I also like the value placed on stretching every part that's been worked.

Special features has an even more compressed workout that's a nice alternative, just as effective and even harder because it takes place in a shorter time.  This is one of my top 5 workout DVDs for a few years now.",1219363200,4,1386,4.573170731707317
1840337,5,B00008DDVR,"These are great workouts, I need to buy one more and I will have the whole series. If your biggest trouble spot are your legs then these will get it!!!!",1208563200,,152,4.1

It was very hard to concentrate on the precision movements when I just wanted to rip her head off for constantly saying, ""Can you tuck? Can you lift your leg? Can you do that? Can you?""  The movements themselves were rather easy and required way too few reps, so it wasn't an issue of ""can"" at all.
I have no motivation to try any of the other DVD's because of this woman's poor attitude.  Even the DVD editors themselves offer a ""workout with music"" option on the DVD so that you can tune out this woman and focus on the moves.  However, the workout itself was not challenging at all, so it's just not worth it!",1201478400,4,912,5.594202898550725
1840339,5,B00008DDVR,"I tried this DVD for the first time and was quite impressed by how challenging it is for a beginner like me.  The exercises are not difficult to perform, at least a few times, and I found myself having to stop and rest a few moments, but then getting right back into the routine the instructor and her two companions were doing.  Not once do you pick up a weight, go to a machine, or start using a resistance cord, but by using the weight of your own body and moving in certain ways, you WILL surprise your muscles (and yourself) by putting every part of your body through some pretty tough paces.  If you are a beginner with at least a little familiarity with Pilates and/or yoga, this helps.  If you are determined to stick with a workout that is challenging but still possible to learn and master, and if you really want to do something that will transform your body if done faithfully, then these exercises are for you.

Stretching is emphasized as an essential component to any workout that taxes the muscles, and you will be immediately doing exercises to stretch and relax the muscles you have just worked.  This also gives you a chance to get a short break from the vigorous muscle strengthening moves.  Even in an air-conditioned room, you should be prepared to perspire quite a bit.

The only props you will need are the back of a sturdy chair (to use in lieu of a ballet bar) and a small towel to assist in your leg stretching moves.

What I especially appreciated is the fact that although you are striving to achieve greater flexibility and strength, you are not trying to make yourself look like a female bodybuilder or even a heavily muscled female athlete.  Some women love the look of ""six-pack abs,"" bulging biceps, and veins that protrude through the skin.  That, plus a skin tone that makes some women in fitness magazines look like they've smeared barbecue sauce all over their skin is definitely not for me.  The Lotte Berk Method is for women who want to be fit, healthy, young and attractive well past middle age, but also thoroughly and unquestionably FEMININE.  If you want to look like a graceful and lithe dancer and not some androgynous freak, I highly recommend this workout.  I intend to try the other DVDs in the Lotte Berk series too.",1182902400,8,2267,4.551724137931035
1840340,4,B00008DDVR,"I just did this dvd for the first time.  I feel it in my thighs and abs.  It's harder than it looks and requires careful attention to positioning.  The instructor is annoying, but the workout itself is worthwhile.  I will probably need a few more attempts to get the exercises done right because some moves are really subtle.  There is no cardio section, so it's not a complete workout program in itself.",1167609600,4,404,4.555555555555555
1840341,1,B00008DDVR,"I dislike this video Not because it doesn't use traditional moves, but because it is not much of a workout for advanced exercisers and is too dangerous for beginners to use.  (It seems like the Lotte Berk method is potentially beneficial, but I wouldn't recommend this particular ""Essentials"" tape.  Instead, I think the ""The Bar Method"" videos better because that instructor concentrates on form and explains moves without stopping the flow of the workout, and is more suitable for a wider audience (simple exercises that beginners can do, but can be intensified for advanced)).

In this Lotte Berk video the instructor spends A LOT of time explaining the next step, but does NOT do it in a way that emphasizes good form, so after a long talk it is still likely that the specific motion won't be done correctly (e.g. she doesn't point out don't drop your butt during the push ups, and doesn't point out that the bent knee exercises should be done with the knees parrallel to the toes).

The types moves are too difficult in nature for beginners and very hard on the knees.

However, since you end up doing so little reps and there is so much downtime, the workout is too boring and not challenging enough for more experienced exercisers.

Summary of Moves:

marching knee lifts

ARMS:  knee push ups, reverse push ups (kind of like dips working triceps), triceps stretch

THIGH(very tough on knees): hamstring stretch, plies, pelvic tuck, swing hips right/left, quad stretch

SEAT: hip extensions, butt stretch

ABS: sit down holds, more stretching

thigh lifts (tough on the knees), thigh stretch

more stretching",1167264000,21,1615,4.911439114391144
1840342,4,B00008DDVR,"This workout offers a little of everything from the LB library.  It begins with the standard leg pushes, follwed by push ups.  Next is barre work for the seat&thighs.  Each exercise ends with gentle streches.  It then moves on to floor work which mainly consist of streching and some light ab work. This DVD also features an additional workout on its special features which offers a slightly pumped version of the warm-up in the main workout followed plies (squats) with the LB tuck, along with abs and streching.  The additinal workout is about 9-10 minutes.

All and all if you are intrested in LB system this might be a good introduction for you.  However for the money I would highly recommend HIGH ROUND ASSETS & MUSCLE EATS FAT also from the LB Library. This would also be great exercise routine for someone just starting out or looking to get back in shape after a long absence.

I have been searching for 13 years for Lotte Berk and now I have found it. Again it is fantastic,25 minutes of toning and stretching. Unlike other work out video's that last for hours.

The lead instructor is patronizing, and two out of three have hair hanging over their faces at least 50% of the time, which was very unpleasant to watch (don't they have hair bands or something?). I only watched it once and then returned to the library. I watched previews for other LB workouts, and only one had a pleasant instructor.

If you are interested in this type of workout, I suggest you try The Bar Method: Fat Free or Designer Sculpting. I own both and do them at least a couple of times a day.",1129161600,4,568,4.40952380952381
1840345,4,B00008DDVR,"First, the instructor:  (insert eyerolls ad infinitum) When you read reviews of Lotte Berk Method instructors being condescending and patronzing, this is the chick they're all complaining about. I'm telling you now, you are going to want to lunge through your screen and beat her senseless.

If you buy this or the set and you already know the basics, do yourself a favor and do this workout to just the music, otherwise you will have a headache. I think she means no harm and isn't aware of her patronizing 'tude but one more mental patient tone in which she asks, ""Now where are you feeling that? In your thighs? Good! That's where you should be feeling it."" or ""Now where are your feet positioned? Look down, check!"" ""Can you lift your arms?"" ""Can you bring your leg up?"" ""Can you feel that?""

(What I forgot to mention in the other reviews is another option for support is using the wall. Barbara, the most advanced person, uses the wall for support during two DVDs and the instructions for using the wall would seem obvious but aren't. Your forehead must remain against the wall and your arms pressed against the wall at the height of your head so if you're a beginner, don't use the wall, lol.)

The barre work isn't so challenging here but this is a basic DVD so those exercises aren't prolonged, just a few for a good intro. The ab work, however, is another story. A few new ab moves that are really challenging and the Knee Dancing is not as fun as the knee dancing in Muscle Eats Fat but it does work your thighs.

You also won't escape push-ups and those killer reverse push-ups, either.

This instructor was really, truly annoying and during some segments, she started snapping her fingers and ... she was so offbeat. (more eyerolling) BUT believe it or not she DOES grow on you and the music is really cool in this DVD. But for first time users, I had to give that caveat. It's only fair. LOL!

I can't give the work-out a thumbs down because once again, the instructions for the set-up are fantastic (if she'd only be quiet once the set-up was completed), the previews of the exercises before you do them are wonderful and the music (as in all of the DVDs) is relaxing and motivating at the same time. The exercises in Basic Essentials are what you already know with a trick or two thrown in for good measure.

It's an excellent intro for anyone who hasn't done TBM or the other Lotte Berk DVDs. It won't scare you off. If you start with the others in the series, you may give up so start with this one or The Bar Method.

The instructor here is good at what she does and friendly overall but her style and technique are annoying. You're really going to want to pinch her. So she gets a D.  (more eyerolling)",1121126400,30,2722,4.43687374749499

It's not something that your body can get used to because if the moves become easy, you simply deepen the stretch/movement. Yes, the instructor is a bit monotone, but I find her encouraging.

So, you get past that.  The fact that she looks like Erin from the Waltons helps too. I can't deny her cueing is on target, and the fact that she breathes ""Your feet!  Are they pointed out?  Check!  Check now!  For the love of God, check!"" you know, i'm ok with that because she's forcing me to, well, check.  I love this method.  If I thought I'd get an all over workout, it's all I'd do but in reality I know you have to mix it up and add more cardio.  I am seeing results and will continue to do this every other day, as suggested.  Interestingly I don't love another one of the DVDs but this one I enjoy, so it's a matter of personal preference - and it's ok for beginners but I would think even intermediates will find this a good workout to throw in from time to time, given the glute, thigh and ab work.  She's great about stretching, too.  I do skip the warm up, I just don't like it, but the rest makes a great 20 minute workout that can stand alone or, when I have time, throw on another DVD and do 10 or 20 minutes (Jessica Smith's Ballet Workout has perfect complimentary 20 workouts, and I also like Core Fusion's 10 minute workouts so you can pick the workout you feel like you're lacking today).  Maybe not for everyone but I hate exercising and this I don't hate.",1410307200,7,1604,4.26158940397351
7982031,5,B00008DDVR,"This series is so great. 30 minutes when time is short or you can combine with something else. Love the Lotte Berk Method!! I would recommend getting the 4 pack series, so you can switch it up a little. You will first feel the difference and then you will see the difference. Long & lean!",1400112000,,288,4.254545454545455
7982032,5,B00008DDVR,"Comprehensive, challenging, yet very doable even if you haven't exercised in awhile.  Obviously you can accomplish this workout at many different levels.  The better I get at this method, the more challenging it seems... very well-constructed, very excellent body mechanics.",1376006400,3,274,5.825
7982033,3,B00008DDVR,"I like the exercises but the voice of the instructor gets on me. Maybe it's just me, but she speaks to the camera, (us) as if we are totally juvenile and uneducated. Not sincere.",1361404800,,178,4.264705882352941
