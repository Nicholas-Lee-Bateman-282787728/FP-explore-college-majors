4911133,5,B005ZKTGTG,"I must say that I enjoyed this. I started out with no expectation and it entertained very well. It is nicely produced, doesn't attempt to go over the top and for that it works. It is a good small time movie. The music is gently woven into the story and the story line works for me.",1330646400,9,281,4.035714285714286
4911134,5,B005ZKTGTG,"""The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom"" is an independent Canadian film produced by a Montreal-based producer that tells the story of a little 11 year old girl living in the Prairies in Canada in 1976. She discovers she is adopted and one day while watching television sees Dolly performing ""I Will Always Love You"" on her then syndicated television show called ""Dolly"" and imagines Dolly is her birth mother. She then is determined to cross the border to the U.S. where Dolly is having a concert to confront her.

 The story is amusing, heart-felt and emotional and even if your not a fan of Dolly's (but who isn't?) this movie will tug at your heartstrings. It really shows what children go through when they find out they are adopted at a later age and the importance it is to know their paternal parents.

 Dolly Parton loved the movie, but upon seeing it asked that some profanities be removed from the film before she allowed several of her songs be allowed in it. Some great Dollys tunes(sung by Canadian artists) are included and among them are ""The Seeker"", ""Light of a Clear Blue Morning"", ""Jolene"" and ""I Will Always Love You"". Dolly even does some voice over work for the movie that was recorded in Nashville.

 There is also a CD soundtrack that accompanies the movie.

 ""The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom"" isn't the only Dolly-related independent movie made during 2011. ""From Hollywood to Dollywood"" featuring real-life twins Gary and Larry Lane debut at many theatres and that too is a beautiful and wonderful film.",1323043200,25,1525,4.706766917293233
4911135,5,B005ZKTGTG,"This is a sweet movie, and should be better known than it is. Interesting characters and a fun examination of the fan mentality. The story between the mother and daughter is just sweet--a story of difficult bonding with an adoptive child that is honestly and lovingly told.",1424390400,2,273,4.829787234042553
4911136,1,B005ZKTGTG,"I thought it was a Dolly Parton movie, that was why I got it. I DO NOT want it I have not opened it cause I DO NOT WANT. Want to return it",1401408000,,138,3.212121212121212
4911137,1,B005ZKTGTG,"Didnt like the movie at all, waste of a movie.did not even have alot of dolly parton in it. Waste.",1399680000,,98,3.95
4911138,5,B005ZKTGTG,"The viewing public has had access to many ""coming of age"" movies, most of them dealing with boys, but this is a sparse version of a girl's COA movie. And, I use the word ""sparse"" in a positive sense. The viewer is  invited to draw conclusions, make jumps in plot lines,assumptions of motivations.essentially, become part of the movie. And, isn't that always what draws viewers in?
It's a lovely, thoughtful movie chronically the difficult paradigm of a daughter, mother and  a fantasy. The main characters are finely drawn & cast, and even the secondary characters are memorable.
Don't be put off by the Country /Western implications of an association with Dolly Parton. Her involvement is graciously minimal, and, yet essential to the story line. It is well worth your time, and will reverberate long after the movie is over.",1393632000,2,826,4.9352517985611515
4911139,5,B005ZKTGTG,"This movie is wonderful and really unique.  I love indie films in general but any that also incorporate how wonderful Dolly Parton is both professionally and as a human being is a plus.  I loved how Dolly herself was also incorporated into the film but never shown... she never had to act in person in this film - and that was wonderful.  If she had, it would kind of seem a bit narcissistic or strange.  But she did lend her voice on a voice-over part in what appears to be something she might actually have written a fan.

Worth your time if you like indie films like Napoleon Dynamite or Juno.",1391472000,2,596,4.333333333333333

4911142,5,B005ZKTGTG,This is cute movie! A girls coming of age movie. Dolly Pardon is one of favorites. I would recommend those who enjoy family movies.,1355788800,2,131,4.5
4911143,2,B005ZKTGTG,"but did not live up to its potential. The acting was stiff and often contrived, or maybe it was just lack of directing. It was like one clich strung up after another. I'm sorry to say we could not watch any more than the first 40 minutes to get to the 'build-up' of the story.",1353283200,,276,4.036363636363636
4911144,5,B005ZKTGTG,"I love Dolly Parton and bought this movie without ever having seen it since Netflix didn't haven't.  Even though Dolly wasn't in it, I was definitely not disappointed.  It was a really cute chick flick.",1352764800,2,202,4.742857142857143
8489836,1,B005ZKTGTG,I don't have a criticism about the movie: I can't see it. This is the second dvd I have received. I made the mistake of not trying to view it when I received it (family tragedy) and just tried to watch it a year after buying it. No go. This one is in worse condition than the first one. I am out of luck.,1518825600,,304,3.765625

Loved it from the get go-
A few twists along the way....
a few different story plots.",1470355200,,102,4.421052631578948
8489839,4,B005ZKTGTG,"Fun to walk back into the early 80s with the set.  Cute story that addresses the slow realization of how ridiculous gender roles are.  Brings back bittersweet, slightly painful memories of young adulthood.  It was a fun cast, in that I recognized only one person (the dad) and thought everyone did well acting.  Enjoyable soundtrack. I don't know much about Dolly, but after hearing the recorded dialogue that was included in this movie, I was surprised. I had no clue Dolly was such an early humanitarian.",1457308800,,506,4.848837209302325
8489840,5,B005ZKTGTG,"Loved this movie so much. It was nearly autobiographical for me. It brought back so many memories and it handled the topic really well. The very, very end is just awesome.",1456617600,,171,4.548387096774194
8489841,5,B005ZKTGTG,"Sorry, Amazon, I saw this movie on Netflix -- but I hope this review sells some DVDs. It's a movie unintended for the demographic of a 60-ish male yet I appreciated amazing writing, wonderful acting, and a fully realized production. A small movie yet entirely engaging,",1455235200,,269,4.869565217391305
8489842,5,B005ZKTGTG,"What a surprise! The best film I have seen in a very long time, wrapped up so modestly in this humble little story of a young lady's adventure. Every frame of this film is jaw-dropping gorgeous in its color, framing, and very patient camera work. Every performance was sheer hypnosis; I could not look away, think a thought, or even breathe. And all of this says nothing for the plot, which was SO darn good. I mean, what a story! I was truly bowled over. What this movie gave me, was WAY more that I could have ever expected from a movie with a funny title like this. Truly, a masterpiece of film craft, acting, and cinematography in general.",1454716800,,643,4.411764705882353
8489843,3,B005ZKTGTG,It was a strange story,1454544000,,22,3.6
8489844,5,B005ZKTGTG,"I found this film by accident and what a wonderful surprise.  It's so refreshing to see so many female issues addressed in a subtle way, as well a universal themes.  I felt the era was captured very authentically and that the acting and writing were strong.  I liked the characters and felt actors were cast well.  The young girl did a fabulous job.",1454457600,2,349,4.492063492063492
