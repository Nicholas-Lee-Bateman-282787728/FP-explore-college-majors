But, no, this is cultural landfill, suitable only for aliens to analyze before deciding that we are not a worthy civilization.  Garbage animation from a junky Saturday morning kids ""variety"" show that only lasted half a season. Truly stupid, lame jokes and gags, stolen catchphrases.  The worst product from the worst genre of the worst era in bad television.  Even reading this review is wasting too much time on it!

Oh, and that cover art is a lie: that is not how the cartoon art looks.  They probably spent more money on that cover than they did on the whole series in 1975.",1433980800,,713,4.747967479674797
8225299,3,B00000J12C,This Wacky & Packy is not bad. i mean it has all the episodes on the disc. But the picture quality is Bad not good it's like a very old VHS tape and the main menu doesn't have any scene selection that really sucks. The casing is crap you see the picture it's not the same it's way different the art-work on the case is like a 4 yr. old draw on it even the disc very disappointing about this DVD they could of done a better job,1356220800,,426,3.852272727272727
