2551756,5,B000F4TMDW,"Wasn't really aware that Jamie did stand-up, but I love all of his movies and TV shows, so I figured I'd check it out. I got the CD just so I could have a copy of he and Stu's song ""The Left One"", and the comedy is really funny even without the visuals.

Then I got the DVD to see what it was about, after seeing it air in Comedy Central last week. They cut out a bunch of stuff for TV, and censored a lot of it too. The DVD is AWESOME! It really made the jokes from the CD that much better. Demon Girl is my favorite. Great job JK, can't wait to buy you and Stu' album too on July 11th!",1151625600,3,587,3.7338709677419355
2551757,5,B000F4TMDW,"I know Jamie Kennedy from Malibu's Most Wanted and the Jamie Kennedy Experiment and when I got this DVD I thought that it would be okay and it was only 10 bucks, so it wouldn't be that horrible if it wasn't hilarious. Jamie makes jokes to keep it funny even when things are going wrong, he makes fun of a woman who tries to correct him and he makes fun of a cameraman behind him who drops a camera. This DVD was hilarious, the extra features aren't that great, some are funny, most of the extra features section called something like ""jokes that weren't funny enough"" really weren't very funny, but the first one on the list called ""CSI"" was pretty funny and I think they should have put that on the main thing.

Anyway, this is a very funny DVD, it was unfortunately only about an hour long (i think, i don't actually remember the exact time) but from seeing other stand-up DVDs, they are usually pretty short, so this is actually a good length for a stand-up dvd.",1151539200,3,965,4.361111111111111
2551758,5,B000F4TMDW,"Jamie Kennedy is back and better than ever!  My friends just can't get enough of him!  Unwashed is best comedy I've seen in a long time.  I'd def recommend this as a part of anyones dvd collection.  We can't get enough of it, and neither will you. =]",1151539200,2,250,4.145833333333333
2551759,5,B000F4TMDW,"Jamie Kennedy takes shots at everyone in this show, without loosing his charm.  He's playing to a packed crowd but seems like he's in the livingroom with you.  Watch it with your friends like we do- you'll be talking about Demon Girl forever!",1151452800,3,242,4.604651162790698
2551760,5,B000F4TMDW,"I gotta be honest, when I saw that Jamie Kennedy had a stand up DVD and CD, I was skeptical.  I knew him from TV and movies, and thought he was funny, but stand up????  I figured that he's just an actor who's trying to capatalize on his fame.  But, like I said, I think his movies are funny, so I decided to give it a chance.  I bought both the CD and DVD (the DVD had extras).  Let me tell you, I was so surprised!!!  He is hilarious!

The DVD is almost an hour of great stand up.  His presence on stage, the voices, the attitude, everything....just wonderful.  His joke about how people who work at Chinese restaurants yell at the help but are nice you...I had to rewind it 4 times, it made me laugh so hard.

And the extras were great too.  He really put a lot of bonus stuff on here for his fans, but honestly, the stand up wouldn't been enough.

Kudos to Jamie!

2551761,5,B000F4TMDW,"I never knew Jamie Kennedy as a stand-up.  He just seemed like a funny guy, who can act, but I guess he's been doing this awhile.  Anyway, it's hilarious.  His voices and characters are great.  When he slams an audience member for correcting him in his act, to when he yells at a cameraman who drops a chair during the set, Jamie is one smart, funny dude.  Get the DVD... Comedy Central cut out a bunch of good stuff at the end of the special.  And the DVD extras are worth it.",1151452800,2,477,4.130434782608695

8117538,5,B000F4TMDW,This was definitely one of the most funniest stand ups that I've ever seen. It let me know the funny side of Jamie Kennedy. Would definitely recommend to Jamie Kennedy fans!,1395705600,,173,4.612903225806452
8117539,2,B000F4TMDW,I like Jamie kennedy for his show the Jamie kenndy experiment but the stand up routine was nothing to laugh at the beginning of the show was alful he comes out on stage whereing a hoody and you think is that the routine but then he takes off the outfit and then its Jamie the beging was bad and the end was bad the middle was ok the sex jokes was bad to about sex and animals come on,1373500800,,383,3.8607594936708862
8117540,1,B000F4TMDW,I have no problems at all with material that some might find offensive if it's funny. We need to be able to laugh at ourselves and the world around us. But someone needs to tell Jamie Kennedy that offensive is not automatically funny. There was nothing funny about this act; it was crude for the sake of being crude with no laughs. I'll never watch this comedian again.,1328745600,,369,4.4411764705882355
8117541,4,B000F4TMDW,"I enjoyed this a lot. There were a number of laugh our loud moments and he has a distinctive style. I don't know if any of it was super-original, but I would definitely seek out more.",1302134400,,183,4.111111111111111
8117542,5,B000F4TMDW,"This guy is very talented. I loved this DVD, it was funny from start to finish.",1272758400,,79,4.0
8117543,2,B000F4TMDW,"This was ok.  Funny enough to make the girls laugh...but then, well...anyway.  He can be funny, but with his twit demeanor and petty jealousy it's hard to fully embrace him.",1258934400,,173,4.733333333333333
8117544,5,B000F4TMDW,I really loved Jamie Kennedys Uwashed it was very funny. Ilove anything  that Jamies in I have never been disappointed. I also got his book from Amazon Wannabe I couldn't put it down. He went through so much to make it and never gave up. I recommend both!!!!,1217376000,,258,4.375
8117545,2,B000F4TMDW,"I agree with some of the other reviews on here, if you like JKX, you may or may not like this DVD.  It does seem like he struggles at different times throughout the show.  It's extremely raunchy - like jokes about 5-year-olds masturbating?!?  It's stupid at times.  It does have a really high production value though.

Some of the extras on the DVD are ""jokes that weren't funny enough"" which is a set of jokes they edited out of the main show because they were worse than the already ""average"" jokes that made it into the show.  Then there's another ""bonus feature"" where he re-uses a joke that his opener uses, thus totally embarrassing himself.  So the ""extra features"" are actually very dissappointing.

Overall this is incredibly average and Jamie is just simply better at the Jamie Kennedy Experiment.  I recommend any of the three seasons if you truely want to see Jamie at his finest.",1165104000,,892,4.666666666666667
8117546,1,B000F4TMDW,"A flashy, well-shot stand up comedy special featuring an overstuffed set (which provides the biggest laugh). Kennedy uncomfortably meanders from topic to topic, only at ease when playing the wacky characters that are supposedly the backbone of his comedic ability.  He has no point of view, no personality, and, it seems, no jokes (look it up on IMDB; four writers are credited).  In a market where original voices struggle for years to get this kind of exposure, its sickening that a vapid pseudo-celebrity like Jamie Kennedy can manage to convince the masses that this is stand up comedy.",1153699200,2,590,5.010204081632653
