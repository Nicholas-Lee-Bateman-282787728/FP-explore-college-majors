7864969,5,6304212720,"The fear of the unknown and the sense of separation are removed in most cases of people who have had NDEs, replaced by a great sense of purpose; these are some of the benefits discussed in this documentary about the experience. There are five people (2 men, 3 women) who share their stories, and also a philosopher, a parapsychologist, and a theologian who weigh in on the subject.
All five speakers are intelligent and articulate, and all have slightly different angles to what comes down to the same basic principle, like a crystal seeing the same light and giving off different colors.
My favorite description was by Alan, who said it was like as if one was an Eskimo, only knowing the occasional warmth from a fire, and ""being transported to a South Sea island"".
The medical advancements that are bringing about increased resuscitations, are allowing more and more of these cases to come to light, and also enabling those of us who have had spontaneous ""out-of-body"" experiences not initiated by a traumatic or medical condition, to be able to talk about them without everybody thinking we are crackpots (yes, there are always those who scoff, but they will learn, sooner or later).
This is a fascinating film for anyone interested in the subject or for someone who has had a similar event happen to them.
Doctors, nurses, and anyone who works with the infirm or elderly should also see it. The sound and photography are fine, and total running time is 40 minutes.",1083369600,11,1468,4.783464566929134
7864970,5,6304212720,"As a three time near-death experiencer, I am immensely grateful to this powerful no-frills video for the validation and support (quite unavailable to me in both 1957 and 1975 when I made my first two excursions into the hereafter) that it gives me everytime I watch it. I own three copies: one for each experience I guess! It is the absence of distracting, inane narration, glitzy special effects and mad scrambles for empty, perceptually-biased, evidential back-up that marks this Round Trip video as a winner in my heart, for it honors the untutored stories of real people and, without apology, offers their direct, sincere testimony as the valuable, substantial gift it is to all who can hear and receive it. Also, as a mother who not only returned from the brink of death herself but as one who repeatedly accompanied her only son to that same brink and back until he made a final crossing at age 16, I must add that this straightforward documentary soothes my weary, sorrowed soul in a way that no theoretical platitudes or clinical hypotheses could ever approach. My wounded heart is not healed by the conjecture of so-called ""professional experts"" and ""technique-educated observers"". Whenever I forget what my own experiences have instilled as direct knowing in me and my grief threatens to immobilize me again in the dark pit of despair, I reach for the tissues, turn on my VCR and watch Round Trip all over again. Then, as I listen through my grateful tears to these wonderful, regular folks who tell their stories without guile, I remember that  Love is the eternal flame of me,  I reunite with the spirit of the child I thought I lost, and sink back into the welcoming comfort of a truth whose arms reach out to me only in the timeless stories of other survivors and thrivers...my experience-sharing peers. Each time I listen, the Light that shines behind the words shared never fails to lift away another layer of grief and forgetfulness. If a trudge through the cold, detaching isolation of science and empty rhetoric is what you seek, then stay away from Round Trip by all means. But if it is a comforting journey into the human spirit's unbreakable connectedness that you seek, then run with a copy to your VCR now. May endless Blessings grace eternally all who freely contributed to this most beautiful video.",976060800,55,2325,4.81
7864971,5,6304212720,If you've ever wondered about death and or have lost someone dear. This video is very insightful and helpful in guilding you towards all the answers and an understanding. There really are people who have experienced it and are willing to share their thoughts and this director leads them in this way of answering that we can understand.,974332800,21,336,4.810344827586207
