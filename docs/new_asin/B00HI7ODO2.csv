Skip's playful attitude makes you work your practice a little harder. It is fun, joyful and an awesome class. The 10 minute ab workout is an added bonus! Well done Skip!",1395792000,,334,3.8550724637681157
8632969,5,B00HI7ODO2,"Be warned, this is not a slick production (although certainly not bad, either) and certain things might annoy you.  Instructor Skip Jennings and the cast are facing straight into the sun, and the glare must be horrendous, because they constantly squint and look away.  It's almost painful to watch -- so I stopped.  :)  Seeing that was really distracting to me, so I stopped looking for the most part, and just listened to Skip's instructions.  Also, Skip called me ""Boo"" many times.  Huh?  I'm not sure what that's about.  And there was one thing that I thought was a very bad choice in an at-home DVD without serious preparation -- he and his crew do the splits and challenge you to do the same.  Not. Good. Judgment.  The only other yoga DVD I've seen that attempts splits is Sonic Yoga Flowing Into Splits, and you have an entire class of preparatory poses before you even attempt it.  All that being said, I liked this DVD!  The poses are done at a perfect pace -- not too fast, and not too slow.  It's challenging enough to keep your interest, but not something that will make you sweat buckets if all you want that day is to stretch and unwind, and wake up your muscles.  So if the drawbacks I mentioned seem like something you can live with, I heartily recommend you give this a try.",1394150400,,1291,4.461538461538462

8632971,5,B00HI7ODO2,"I have yet to find a better Yoga class than Skip's, and I was ecstatic to find out I can now do it from home!! I'm waiting by the computer for this DVD to be available again!! :D Do yourself a favor and get this DVD. Two words: Worth. It.",1390262400,,238,3.78
8632972,5,B00HI7ODO2,"Skip Jennings is an inspirational exercise teacher, he has real commitment and passion, he has years of utterly professional expertise and he knows that thought the spirit is willing the flesh can sometimes be weak. What I appreciate about this man's approach is that he is not a cartoon sergeant major shouting higher, faster, more at his 'grunts'. He has a really personal commitment to working with people from the physical and personal place they are coming from, helping to plan a journey and reaching a destination. He has made a great difference to me and I am thrilled by his new DVD's they are very inspiring and very practical.",1389830400,,637,4.8

He is a true inspiration and the DVD allows you work at your own pace, but gives you encouragement along the way. I use it all the time! I highly recommend it! Namaste",1389744000,,259,4.2
