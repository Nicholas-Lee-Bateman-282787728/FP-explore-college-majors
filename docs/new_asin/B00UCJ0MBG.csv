This documentary was actually distributed by a major studio!  Its about the largest oil spill in US history: the blowout at the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Maconda oil field, Gulf of Mexico.  So in many ways you probably expect this to be a familiar story.  In many ways it IS.  There are some familiar faces: Obama on TV, Tony Hayward the former CEO of BP, Kenneth Feinberg the claims mediator.  Others are less familiar: interviews with eyewitness survivors to the blowout, with family members of some who died, and with residents and small business owners along the gulf
.
And you expect the theme to be familiar and in many ways it is: that corporations by their very nature are set up to put profits first and the lives of people second.  And a Federal government for whom oil revenues are the second-largest source of revenue after personal income taxes finds it hard to say no for very long to big oil companies.

This film doesnt show the very worst images of the disaster, but it shows some of it early on.  Lord knows, I don't really want to see another image of a sea bird coated with oil.  But I think most of the public have NO IDEA how bad the ocean looked in the initial weeks after the blowout.  If you remember a classic photo of Kuwait immediately after Iraqi forces had exited, leaving behind hundreds of burning oil wells and a sky black like the night--you don't see those kind of images in this movie, although rather similar photos do exist.  The worst you see is vast ribbons of red oil, stretching across the blue water of the gulf.
It is worth hearing again the first-hand accounts of how multiple safety regulations were slowly but persistently eroded on the rig, of how the executives of a corporation involved rewarded themselves huge bonuses the year after this explosion which killed 11 crew and fouled hundreds of square miles of ocean and shoreline, citing among other reasons their generally great safety record.  And you see some home-movies crew members made of daily life on the rig before the blowout, and as mentioned above, hear them recount in detail what the final moments just before and after the explosion were like.  Although its old news, its still gripping.  If anything, the malfeasance at multiple sites is downplayed, but what is presented is good documentary.  B+",1445644800,,2374,4.674698795180723

7036108,5,B00UCJ0MBG,"Margaret Brown is rapidly becoming a remarkable seasoned documentary producer. One of her previous offerings, ""Order of the Myths"" was not as subtle in its portrayal of a segregated pastime that is maintained as a holy tradition in Mobile Alabama. This time she documents the impact of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. She presents what seems to be a typical eco-system preserving attack on the greedy oil industry, but balances it with sobering statistics, like second to taxes, oil lease revenues are the federal government's largest revenue producer in this country. She presents the energy sobering statistic that although the American population is only 4% of the world, we consume greater than 20% of the oil produced in the world. Yet our gasoline is cheaper than anywhere else. This film will prompt much healthy debate and perhaps result in some meaningful future changes.  What the film clearly conveys is the complexity of the issues involved. As a film  it is a masterpiece of reporting, analysis, demonstrating the hard cold facts and the human impact that oil drilling produces. I truly hope she continues in her film making. I for one have become a devoted follower of this remarkably talented producer for her skills and more significantly her integrity in presenting the issues.",1429401600,5,1302,5.023148148148148

I found Thu  documentary well filmed, and-despite what could easily have turned into a 'good guys-bad guys' film, it is mostly free of bias.
