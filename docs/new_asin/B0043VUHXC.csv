4257824,2,B0043VUHXC,"Mostly talking about the 3D effects here.
I watched this on a Panasonic TC-P65VT25 set and a Panasonic DMP-BDT100 player, which I've also used to watch Legends of the Guardians, Avatar, Resident Evil: Afterlife, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, all in 3D.  The Universe: 7 Wonders of the Solar System is the first one that made me feel nauseous.  This could be because of the uneven 3D effect that had some very bad ghosting.  When it was good, no ghosting, and a very deep 3D field, with some good pop-out effects too, but when that ghosting reared its ugly head, it was in your face, no need to look for it, and very distracting.  About half of the show was good, half bad.

The show itself was OK, and a nice compliment to The Universe series, which is a very simplified science series, and continued here.  What did annoy me was the section where the interviewees were talking about how 'Hollywood' got things wrong with how it portrayed the asteroid belt, then the show continued to make the same 'mistake'.  I was hoping that they would take the time to show what it actually would look like, not just describe it, but they kept going back to the same inaccurate portrayal.  Annoying.

This is one 'blind buy' I am sorry I made.

Skip it.",1295049600,23,1250,4.491150442477876
4257825,1,B0043VUHXC,"An OK 2d movie but not worth the money to purchase in 3d, terrible graphics as far as I was concerned and would not buy this again or recommend it.  Seems like it was shot with a cheap camera, the art work was often like watching a cartoon and really never got my interest or attention since I was watching it for the 3d.",1295049600,20,321,4.015625
4257826,5,B0043VUHXC,Put simply: it's dope. I've been a fan of this show for a while and the graphics keep getting better every season. The info is fascinating and the subject matter really benefits from 3D technology. Everything really pops out at you. The part with Saturn is ccrriizzaazzzyyy!!! Awesome show can't wait for season 6!,1294963200,2,314,4.833333333333333
4257827,5,B0043VUHXC,"As a long time fan of the popular History Channel series ""The Universe"", I was really blown away with this episode. With all the 3D hub bub of the last couple of years, I was wondering when outlets like the History Channel would get around to something like this. All I can say is that this program looked great! The animation was spectacular and I enjoyed the new 3D interviews and live action portions with the now familiar Universe experts. I'm really happy that this is in my collection.",1294963200,4,491,4.52808988764045
4257828,1,B0043VUHXC,"I preordered this through Amazon and it arrived yesterday. In October I bought a top of the line Panasonic 3D TV & Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player. The other 7 3D discs I own display great 3D images with the shutter glasses. That's what I was expecting for this disc. However when I popped it into the player and picked 3D from the PLAY menu, NO 3D. Usually on this TV when you hit PLAY you get a momentary box in the upper right hand corner of the screen that says PLAY and under it FULL 3D. This time only says PLAY. Tried all the options in the 3D setup menu to no avail. Last resort figured maybe the PLAY menu was mislabeled so picked 2D. No matter whether I picked 2D or 3D, the picture was EXACTLY the same. Very disappointed to pay this price for a short documentary and not get the 3D. It's going back to Amazon. (and yes, my TV and player have the latest firmware updates)",1294876800,8,878,4.170588235294118
4257829,4,B0043VUHXC,"This 3D Blu-Ray exceeded my expectations.  I was expecting the same episode that originally aired on The History Channel, probably with some gimmicky 3D effects added in (yes, I bought it anyway, hoping that I was wrong).  However, I was surprised to see (what I believe to be) some new, 3D interview footage and some new narration recorded specifically for this release.  The 3D effects are very good.  Seeing tiny Mercury eclipse the giant Sun in 3D is breathtaking as are some of the beautiful images of the rings of Saturn.  Sure, most of it is CG, but that's fine because it looks really great.  The only poor CG has to do with the spacecraft in which you are supposedly touring the solar system.  Really, my only complaint is that there is some substantial crosstalk in many scenes, mostly when you see an object against the blackness of space.  If that weren't true, I would have given this release 5 stars instead of 4.

My 2-year-old son is showing a lot of interest in space/planets/astronomy, so I thought he might enjoy this.  Indeed, he did.  He sat riveted through the whole thing (which, if you knew my hyper son, is pretty amazing).  ""Is that Saturn?"", ""Look, the Sun!  It's coming out of the TV!"", ""Wow, the Sun is very hot!"", etc.  One thing this video accomplished for my son is something I had been unable to articulate to a 2-year-old; that is the sheer size of the planets.  The 3D really helps to illustrate this in a way that nothing else can.  I think he now has a good sense of how enormous the sun is when compared to other planets.

This video satisfied an itch that I hoped would have been scratched by many of the 3D Imax documentaries out there that disappointed me.  It's a good, 3D documentary that can serve as a good demo of your new 3D TV, yet also be interesting and watchable in its own right.  ""7 Wonders of the Solar System"" accomplishes this nicely.  Sure, it has a few problems (crosstalk, poor CG graphics for the spacecraft, etc.), but overall I'm really happy with it.  Videos are subjective though, so your mileage may vary.",1294876800,111,2070,4.525606469002695
4257830,1,B0043VUHXC,Looked like old animation converted to 3D mixed with new interviews shot in 3D. Very poor quality space animation with an added cartoon like hud display (would have been better without it)overlayed on the screen. Very disappointed!,1292025600,64,231,5.27027027027027

4257837,3,B0043VUHXC,"OK I am going to be generous here and give this 3 stars. I really feel compelled to give it two stars though as I really did not enjoy this film as much a I had hoped I would. I am a 3D nut who enjoys pretty much any 3D title as long as it was executed good. And on that note, that is where the problem is with this title. The narration was even done just half as well as it could have been. The 3D was sub par, the narration was sub par, the information that the film delivered was just OK. I have seen many other educational films and documentary style films on our solar system and found this one to be quite boring in comparison.

As for the 3D well as mentioned it was just OK. I have quite the selection of 3D titles and this falls to within the bottom worst three I own. I would not recommend this title to anyone wanting to show off their 3D TV, or even to anyone just wanting to add a 3D title to their collection. There are only about three or four 3D shots that are worthy of going 'wow that was cool', and for the money and time spent viewing this title it just isn't worth it.

 So all in all I would say steer clear of this title and look for something else to spend your hard earned cash on, you'll be glad you did.",1497744000,3,1230,3.912

4257853,4,B0043VUHXC,This is a nice 3D dvd. One scene in particular is very beautiful. The sun has been filmed from two extreme vantage points in the earth's orbit and the two different views are used to produce an impossible 3D image of the sun which could only happen in nature for a creature so large that it's eyes would naturally be set that far apart. It is remarkable. It is not a perfect DVD. There is some ghosting. But it's is very nice and some parts are breathtaking.,1481673600,,458,4.275862068965517

I actually got the wrong movie I meant to get and this isn't particularly my favorite one, but with that being said I still want to keep it and it's exactly as advertised. The negative feedback pertaining to 3D quality is nonsense. If it's as bad as they say, it's because they bought the cheapest 3d tv on the market and had nothing to do with the product itself.

Just an fyi.. the episode I meant to order was  wonders of the universe, not wonders of the solar system. All the same, it's exactly as described and, for the price, buy it just to have it if nothing else.

There are several times where the parallax is reversed, particularly in the asteroid belt and one shot of the sun.  In all of the interviews with the astronomers, the cameras are horribly misaligned.  (If you have a passive 3DTV, you can pause it, take off your glasses and see a huge vertical offset.)  These are rookie mistakes.  You can read the rest in other posts.
It's disappointing to see in a show that promotes science, especially since badly done 3D can turn people away from the medium.  I bought this title without seeing it previously because usually ""The Universe"" series is quite good.",1418515200,,766,4.765151515151516

As for the 7 wonders that were picked. OK, interesting selections. I guess it's hard to pick just seven things when there's so many wonders to choose from. The video of the sun was really different with the surface churning and the whole thing just floating there because of the 3D effects.

It was also neat that the scientists were more obviously standing in front of the background. This video comes from the history channel so it does cover some of the science and give's actual scientists a chance to talk about what we're seeing. Other than the 3D, it's almost like watching something on the history channel. I love the history channel. Hence I loved this video.

4258042,2,B0043VUHXC,"As a piece of educational entertainment, this disc is actually pretty decent. I had fun exploring the solar system and seeing some of it's highlighted amusements. However as a piece of 3D entertainment it fails miserably. Copious technical problems with the stereoscopic image keep this disc from achieving what could have been a 3 or even 4 star review. And even worse, most of the issues could have - and should have - been caught in its cursory Q&A review before release, but didn't. For instance, every chapter title screen has it's polarity reversed. Every single one! And there are other instances where the polarity is reversed. This is a cardinal sin of 3D mastering, simply because it's so easy to fix - it's just that no one did. There is also a veneer of inconsistent 3D over the whole production. The talking head sections are particularly discombobulating as your eyes struggle to adjust to the severe 3D-ification of those green screened moments. All that said, this disc has it's moments. The star field during the hyper warp segment was particularly fun, but as a whole it comes up short due to some unfortunate mastering mistakes. Perhaps a 2.0 will be remastered some day and made available. If so, count me back on board.",1407974400,,1240,4.799065420560748

Everything - and I mean EVERYTHING is shoddy, brief, and shallow, not even worthy of a high school term paper.

I expected it to be about as good as the series, and content-wise, it's ok.  3d is another story.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the 3D graphics are cheesy.  Not only that, but many of them have horrible 3D errors.  One example is when asteroids are shown, and the depths are all wrong; many of the asteroids are further into the screen than the stars.  Images of the planets in another recurring clip are drastically different between the left & right eye; Uranus or Neptune are blue for one eye, but virtually black for the other.  Even the live action 3D is screwed up.  The video of the guy int he field has one eye's view higher than the other, so unless you're watching with your head tilted about 45 degrees to one side, the 3D is going to be uncomfortable at best.  This is something that you can spot being wrong without even using 3D glasses (you'll see two images superimposed on one another, and instead of seeing a horizontal shift, you'll see an angled one), so how it got past the editors before going to disc, I have no idea.

Even more than dinosaurs alive.  Look 3d is about depth mainly and not things coming out at you. Of course things shot in 3d look the best in 3d by  far. But this was shot 2d.  The complaints on here are from people who expected too much. They didn't know what this was because they probably don't watch the great channels out there like the history channel or science channel. The science here is good science and so their complaints are not worth voicing. If you want advanced science watch one of the more technical shows. Ok, this one is a ok little episode.

4258178,3,B0043VUHXC,"Please note, I did NOT watch this in 3D (I do not have a 3D TV), so I cannot comment on that component of it, just the show itself.

This roughly hour long episode, which cover the ""7 wonders of the solar system"" was entertaining and somewhat informative (some of it I was familiar with, some of it I was not).  I have seen better, more informative programs, but this wasn't bad.  It was written for an audience with a moderate understanding of the solar system, no more, so I think there was bound to be some overlap with past programs or knowledge.

My primary ""complaint"", if you can call it that, with the show was that it felt gimmicky.  The space ship (which was, as some have said, prooly animated) felt cheesey, and the constant reminders that it was a 3D program were silly.  Furthermore, one of the scientists was quite cheesey in his explanations.  I also felt the choice of Earth as the #1 wonder was cliched and predictable; I assumed Earth or Life would be the #1 and I was disappointed that they didn't surprise me.

All that said, I learned things I didn't know before, so I got what I wanted out of it.  It was entertaining and interesting, and I don't feel that I was cheated out of my $10...and more importantly, it answered my question as to whether I might want to buy the Universe series (which I think I will).

When I first got my LG 3D television, I wanted to look up every 3D movie on DVD to play on it. I got the dinosaur one and the fish one, and a whole bunch of them including the sports illustrated swimsuit one. Some movies show depth in the scene (such as the swimsuit one) more than the scene popping out at you. This movie is the later. If you like space and you like 3D, this is a must have movie. Planets and asteroids go flying by and the detail is amazing. It is everything I could ever want in the 3D experience. I highly recommend this DVD.",1310342400,3,644,3.9236641221374047

If you love the History channel's shows on the Universe, you will be stunned at the beauty of this movie!  The 3D is just spectacular!!  I cannot say enough good things about the 3D.  I showed it to my sister, who loves these kind of information shows also, and she was blown away by the experience.  But I also love how History Channel put this together.  I definitely learned things about our own solar system I did not know.  And I watch these type of History, Discovery, Science channel shows ALL the time.  I mean, ALL the time.  The graphics really illustrate, in a very up close way, what the presenters are telling you in this movie.  The scientists not only tell you about Encelidus (one of the Wonders), but you see what it looks like.  The experience was more like being in a planetarium than watching a movie.  When the sun is being explained, you literally feel as though you can just reach out and touch it.  Really stunning.  I won't give away what all the Wonders are, but you will love how the History channel brings them to you.

4258220,1,B0043VUHXC,"I wanted to like this, I really did.  I like science.  I especially like physics and astronomy. And, as a relatively new 3D owner, I'm still pretty tolerant.

Here's what the product info doesn't tell you.  This is not an IMAX movie, or any other feature.  It's one of those History Channel science shows.  There are short segments on each of the ""7 Wonders of the Solar System"".  The science is pretty simplistic. (The Sun is Hot, the Earth is Pretty, Saturn has Rings).  The places where we come back from commercial and they recap what has been in the previous part of the show and what's coming up after the next commercial break comprise more than 10% of the content.  They might have improved it by at least editing this as if we were going watch it commercial free.

The 3D quality? Very poor. The primary 3D is an animated frame that shadowboxes the edges of the 2D content.  By animated I mean drawn, not moving - it's pretty stationary. The poor little animated spaceship is what your kids make when they get their first animation software.  Only a couple of times when it goes to hyper drive is there actually a 3D effect of the stars.

There are maybe 10 minutes of okay 3D in this - a couple of minutes of NASA spacecraft animation, a couple of minutes of nature footage in the Earth segment, and (the only really nice thing) a recreation of the data from the 3D solar observatory.  The sun looks rather conical, but at least it's high def and interesting.

If you must buy this, try to get in touch with those who wrote the 5 star reviews- they must have way better vision than I do, or possibly mood altering potions to share.",1300579200,686,1641,4.40531561461794

now if you have your heart set on the 3D nature of this blu ray disc, then go ahead and purchase it. personally i wouldn't buy it for the ""3D special effects"", but if you're into that kind of thing then i say ""go for it"".
i am just interested in ""spacey"" kind of stuff...so, had i known that i could have purchased this as a part of an entire season in normal 2D for the same cost i totally would have! i only just realized this after the fact.

4258224,2,B0043VUHXC,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

Not counting the repeating graphics, There are about 14 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Another 3 around 25%. For 10 seconds stars fly OOS around 50% and one makes it to 70%. Rocks OOS around 25% for 10 seconds, leafs blow by up to 25% for 15 seconds,  a satellite graphic, swings out to 40% and a dolphin's nose extends to over 35%. 18 times the same simplistic space ship council extends 10% and at least 8 times a graphic overlay floats at 20%.

Some short segments were so flat they didn't appear to be in 3D at all.
Excess parallax easily visible in a few scenes.
And yes, as other reviews have said, the graphics add a cheese factor.
Repeating graphics and some repeating scenes.

*** If your not interested in the subject matter, don't buy it just for the 3D ***

MY 3D RATING = POOR to FAIR
(poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4258226,4,B0043VUHXC,"Just remember that this is about our ""Solar System"" not about the ""Universe"". So you will see things about Jupiter-Saturn..the moons around them etc. There are parts of this that are just so-so but then there are parts where I felt like I was floating through the asteroid belt. Yet that was short lived and most of this is CGI, of course. They should have done a lot more of that..it would have been unlike anything else I have seen to date.
  I have read others reviews where they just rip into this but I will tell you from my opinion. I had seen this episode on TV so I knew what to expect. As for me it was well worth the 20 bucks...mine played great in 3D...could have been better. Yet I am glad that I bought it.
  As I said there are a few parts where it put a big smile on my face becuase I felt like I was drifting in space. I hope they do a lot more of these with far more drifting through asteroids - Nebulas.....etc & I am looking forward to the next one.

  If I had to choose between this and Space Station 3-D with Tom Cruise and ""The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3-D"" I would pick Seven Wonders of the Solar System hands down. It was more informative and has far more re-play value as the other two damn near put me to sleep.

I purchased a 65"" top-of-the-line Panasonic 3D TV, Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player and 12 pairs of the Panasonic shutter 3D glasses less than a month ago.  Due to the limited number of 3D movies on the market, I have been purchasing every one of them as soon as available and watching them immediately.  My collection includes Avatar, Clash of the Titans, Under the Sea, Wild Ocean, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Cats and Dogs, Alice in Wonderland, Despecible Me, Legends of the Guardians, Resident Evil, A Christmas Carol, Polar Express, etc.  Every one of my 3D movies has left me in ""AWE"" until today.

""The Universe"" was delivered today and I immediately popped it into my player with my popcorn and drink ready.  I selected 3D on the movie menu and the picture was exactly the same with or without the glasses.  I changed glasses and tried again.  Nothing.  I selected 2D thinking maybe it was reversed, still nothing.  Tried 3D over and over sitting through the whole movie several times trading off with all 12 pairs of glasses ~ no 3D.  Even the 3D glasses were automatically turning themselves off as they're manufactured to do if you stop watching a 3D movie for a period of 10 minutes or longer.

Huge waste of $30.  I felt like I was a kid again in school having to sit through this movie in science class.  Ugh.",1295395200,22,1494,4.518656716417911

Also they overdid computer graphics of asteroid belt. In an interview a scientist says that the distance between asteroids is so large that when you stand on one of them others would appear to be dots. And yet computer generated graphics shows a part of asteriod belt crowded with large rocks where each rock is clearly visible.
