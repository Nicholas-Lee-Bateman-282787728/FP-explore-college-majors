903431,5,6304467060,"Another enjoyable Tupac film, very gritty and very 90's. Both Tupac and Tim Roth are extremely believable as two desperate drug addicts trying to get off the streets while their friend recovers from an overdose. Also features Vondie Curtis-Hall as the duos menacing adversary. Definitely worth watching, with a creative, unique and enjoyable ending.",1453852800,,349,5.481481481481482

903544,5,6304467060,"This was a movie that I hadn't previously heard of but saw the cover on another website and thought I would check into it.  I came to Amazon and purchased GridLock'd on a whim and I have to say that this was an AMAZING movie for the price.  Tupac and Tim Roth both play Heroin Addicts living in Detroit Michigan during the mid 1990's.  They desperately want to get clean after their friend ""Cookie"" overdoses on her first shot of heroin.  However, they both soon discover just how hard it can be to work the system.  After running around town all day long trying to get ""Temporary Medicaid"" cards they finally discover that there isn't such a thing.  The comedic element in this movie is quite pleasing even though it is not the type of movie that will have you rolling on the floor laughing.  The movie is a perfect mix between seriousness and comedy.  If you are a true fan of Tupac and you want to own a classic than please do not hesitate to pick this one up.  Tupac Shakur's performance in this movie is absolutely stunning.  After watching this movie, you will begin to understand that Tupac was not only the greatest rapper to ever live, but was also becoming a very fine talent in Hollywood that most certainly would have flourished had he not been taken from us the way he was.  It is definitely worth the price and I can promise you that you will not find this one at your local Walmart.  So please purchase and enjoy :)

And if you found that this review helped you in your decision to purchase GridLock'd than please click the button and let me know :) It makes me happy to know that my reviews are helping people so it would mean a lot to me if you could click the button and let me know that I wrote a good review :) Thanks again Friend",1356048000,18,1750,4.282674772036474
903545,5,6304467060,He play's a great sleeze bag. It's so damn funny...the idea of these two losers unable to go straight in a legitamate way. Have all of Roth's work and this is in the top fifteen.,1278720000,,178,4.114285714285714
903546,1,6304467060,"Tupac did a good job acting (he was the reason I watched this movie), but the movie was too slow for me. The director's choice of flashbacks to me didn't match with the plot.",1260748800,,174,4.147058823529412
903547,5,6304467060,"I bought this not really knowing if I would like it or not, and I was pleasantly suprised! Although it is a drama, there are lighter, funnier moments that make this film great. I would recommend this to friends.",1250726400,,211,4.435897435897436
903548,5,6304467060,This is an excellent absolutely hilarious movie that no die hard Tim Roth fan can turn down.  Both Roth and Tupac give amazing performaces and portray a believable friendship that can translate through the ages.  The DVD is really skimpy on extras but the movie is the most important thing!,1239148800,,290,4.78
903549,5,6304467060,This movie has all of the action and reactions expected in an up and down drug movie. It has a few lighter moments but the fact is sometimes it's hard to get into public funded rehab. Very sad tupac can't enjoy it now.,1237420800,,218,4.093023255813954
903550,5,6304467060,"a very good movie. the company that i purchased it from is very reliable.  Tupac was very good in this film, if you want to laugh and cry at the same time this is the movie for you.  trying to come clean with drugs but as always there are determents ahead.",1219881600,,256,4.0
903551,5,6304467060,This movie gets 5 stars from me from the very realistic depiction of drug addiction and the performance of Tupac and Tim Roth. These two using buddies portray very real life issues and troubles of todays drug addicts. After rushing their musician partner to the hospital from a drug overdose they jump from problem to problem all the while trying to get help in kicking their habit. This movie has an excellent mixture of misery and humor that creates laughter and the hard face of realty at the same time. If you or anyone you've ever known has or ever had a drug problem you'll relate.,1173312000,,587,4.547169811320755
903552,5,6304467060,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. For a movie with very few action scenes, it keeps your interest the whole time. I think this movie really shows the unbelievable talent that Tupac Shakur had.  Tim Roth and Tupac have an on screen chemistry that is rarely seen in movies lately. This is a must watch.",1169078400,2,315,4.25
903601,4,6304467060,"This movie Gridlock was a comedy of errors form start to finish, i wonder if people really exist like that??? they were both HIV positive ,drug addict banging the same woman who overdosed and they decided to try and fit back into society by kicking their drugs habit by gaining meaningful employment, what a journey!!!!! eventually by pursuing a music career well i think most entertainers are on drugs any way!! duuuh.

Tupac and Tim Roth made this movie worth watching their carisma, wack-out sense of humor and  bold presence, make me sit up pay attention , i never had personal dealings with a drug addict, so i was so nieve!!!Now i look at the world with a open mind because there are so many diffrent people histories and experiences you can see and learn from ,with a closed mind and heart you just can't.

Why i like the movie??? well!!! the acting was believerble even if sometimes i hate a movie ,the acting can keep me focus on the direction the movie is heading, what's the message and what i can learn in the end, that's my motive and intention when i look at a movie, read a book, or even play a game.

this is great movie for person with an open mind if you hate this who cares it is what it is, no one can change that defintely worth buying laterzzzz folks,....",1119312000,,1277,4.398305084745763
903602,4,6304467060,"With a decent plot and very little in the way of action, it is amazing that this film works so effectively. Basically a day-in-the-life tale following the misfortunes of two drug addicts, Spoon (Tim Roth) and Stretch (Tupac Shakur) as they desperately try to kick heroin habits and avoid the unfortunate attention of a local gangster.
The dialogue is quick and funny, and the two leads are very impressive. Shakur is a true revelation and Roth does his usual swaggy/cool style even with his character's boundaries. The film tries to be moral at times, but due to the comedy - just isn't. With a great soundtrack and a live performance at the end from the rapper himself, Gridlock'd succeeds magnificently.",1090195200,2,705,4.883333333333334
903603,4,6304467060,"This is a pretty good movie, not as good as Juice, but good. Any Pac fan needs to get this movie. You won't regret it. Seriously.",951782400,,129,4.0

903605,4,6304467060,"I am looking forward to another movie by Vondie Curtis Hall.  Gridlock'd had a great anti-bureaucracy plot and was well acted by three wonderful actors, Thandie Newton, Tim Roth, and the late great Tupac Shakur.  There  were a few dragging moments, but they are easily overlooked. I was too busy  wondering what was going to happen next!",947980800,,337,4.859649122807017

903607,5,6304467060,I thought it was going to be a gangsta movie but it really wasn't. I can't describe the movie cause it was so tight. So Rest In Peace Tupac and I'll see you at the end of the road.,940291200,,180,3.641025641025641
903608,5,6304467060,"This movie is the best movie Pac ever did. This moviehad a serious message that Pac deliverd like only he could. Tim Roth was the perfect compliment to his character in this flick. R.I.P. PAC,thanx 2 these flicks u live on .",932169600,,224,4.357142857142857
7875061,5,6304467060,"This film is like what would happen if Quentin Tarantino were to watch the Dream Team, Trainspotting, and Stand By Me, write a screenplay, and get Spike Lee to cast and direct it in a year in which Denzel was fully booked. It manages to showcase the horrors inherent in drug culture, from overdoses and addiction to murder, and mixes this with an almost Vaudevillian sense of comedy of errors, courtesy of a trio of misfits: Cookie (Thandie Newton), the naive, hedonistic beat poet; Stretch (Tim Roth), the obligatory loose cannon; and Spoon (Tupac Shakur), the oft-perplexed voice of reason. Between inept and/or sociopathic social services and hospital staff, police being right where they're both the most convenient and inconvenient, an incredible series of chance encounters with a menacing drug dealer and his archetypal mafioso counterpart, and a disgruntled, blind veteran with the best-trained Rottweiler Ive ever seen in a film, Gridlockd delivers nearly all I couldve hoped for. The one and only issue I had with this DVD had nothing to do with the film itself, but simply the lack of English subtitles on which I typically rely due to mild hearing loss; however, the audio was so clear (clearer, in fact, than most modern films) that my usual need to read the dialogue was alleviated simply by turning up the volume a bit more than usual. This is definitely one of those hidden gems that should be added to any film buffs collection.",1524528000,,1445,4.90204081632653

7875068,4,6304467060,"This is a great dark comedy, revolving around two junkies, one of which (Tupac's character) has decided as a New Year's resolution to get clean, the other (Tim Roth's character) isn't as committed but reluctantly decides to as well, when their female bandmate overdoses and needs to be taken to hospital (which is a comedy journey in itself, not sure why they didn't just call an ambulance but that's the type of film this is at times).  Having recently ripped off a guy with a brick inside of a video camera box to get money for drugs, the two realise the guy they conned and assaulted, is a drug kingpin (or at least he thinks he is).  As the two are finding the red tape, bureaucracy and being told to go to one place which tells them as if they are an annoyance or stupid to go to the place they've just been a real frustrating hassle when trying to get into a detox program, they also keep running into and getting shot at by their brick con victim and his goon.

Gridlock'd works because you instantly believe Tim Roth and Tupac's characters are best friends.  If you didn't this movie simply wouldn't work.  The female of the trio doesn't come across as believable, but she's not in many scenes.",1483488000,,1202,4.445454545454545

Thanks for making this move.",1478131200,,301,4.823529411764706
