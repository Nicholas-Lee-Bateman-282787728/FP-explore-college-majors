8110548,4,B000EJ6BLY,"I have this compilation in cd format (tho, there are more songs on that vs this VHS tape) and i love it! the songs are 'extended mixes' on the cd, that's why it's even better. BUT! the videos on Dance Traxx 2 are all in their regular radio versions, which is what i was hoping for. All the videos are logo free (clean) too! The ONLY thing I don't like about it: the videos kinda blend together. When Nu Shooz-I Can't Wait goes into their other video Point of No Return, there isn't a break inbetween them. It's like that with all the videos. Regina-Baby Love is a somewhat shorter version (I have a copy of her video already) also. I am a music video collector of sorts so I WAS a little disappointed. Still, this VHS tape is a piece of 80's history. and the quality is great and the shipping was fast.",1441411200,,802,4.214285714285714
