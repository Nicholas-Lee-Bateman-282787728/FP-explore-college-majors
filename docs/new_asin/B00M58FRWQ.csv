6561677,5,B00M58FRWQ,This is an incredible story that needs to be seen by all children in elementary and middle school.  Gerry did a great job telling his story and the children did a great job bringing his story to life.  A must see in the classroom!,1406851200,3,230,4.204545454545454
6561678,4,B00M58FRWQ,"Gerry does a remarkable job, playing young Adam, and telling a specific on-going story about bullying.
He lets the viewer see first hand how verbal abuse from a parent at home, can turn a child into a bullying abuser, later on. Then he manages to show how circumstances might have been different through the eyes of compassion and communication.
It's a must see, for elementary and middle school students, and recommended for educators as well.",1406851200,3,444,4.933333333333334
6561679,5,B00M58FRWQ,"""There are many anti-bullying films on the market. What makes this one unique is the voice of a child who experienced it first-hand. The resolutions proposed are simple and realistic. If this film prevents the bullying of even one child, then it's done its job."" - Ranny Levy, Founder and President, KIDS FIRST!

The above quote sums up nicely the angle and purpose of The Equation of Life, but the film requires further explanation to understand fully how powerful a film and statement it is. How powerful a tool it can be if utilized.

The Equation of Life is a dramatic narrative feature film written, directed and produced by one child (Gerry Orz/now age 11) who is speaking to all children (and adults) about a subject so important he could not remain quiet. Don't misunderstand. It's NOT a doc by any means (though it is inspired by a true story and contains many elements of it throughout). By 'speaking out', I really mean 'calling out to' his generation. With this support of his parents (a deeply integral part of the story) and a lot of tenacity, Gerry Orz has created a 30+ minute film that can bring young people to the table with a deeper understanding of how their behavior can impact others.

Summed up on the box cover as WORDS + ACTIONS = CONSEQUENCES, The Equation of Life is more than a story about bullying, though its story arc is clearly a bully tale. It teaches that every decision we make changes the path on which we travel. Its message is so powerful that it has the potential to change the way a child, a mother, a father, a friend and a family view life. The fact this this film is the work of a young boy makes it even more powerful. In fact, it's sort of mind shattering that it is the work of such a young boy, though when viewing it is apparent that it is. If you can let yourself see past a young filmmaker's style, you will find yourself entranced by the production.

As an aside, filmmaker Gerry Orz has appeared in front of the California Senate twice speaking on the subject of bullying. His personal work (at such a young age) has resulted in 12/12 being named California's state wide anti-bullying day. Gerry's two appearances are contained on the DVD as bonus material along with his original short which garnered high YouTube views and served as the inspiration for this film.

The Equation of Life can make a difference if it is seen and shared and circulated. Every family should view this... TOGETHER! Every middle school should consider it. Every library should have it available.

Note: The film is targeted to middle schoolers and up. I would not suggest it for children under 5th grade. While the first portion of it is autobiographically based, events in the middle of the film pack a bit of a punch and become fiction-with-a-purpose. The film also presents a retro of itself within it by presenting previous scenes under ""what if"" scenarios (though very cleverly developed). This provides an incredible dynamic for discussion points either within a family or within a classroom. It is what the term ""equation"" really refers to, as you see how different playouts might effect the final results.

I highly recommended The Equation of Life. As Ms. Levy wrote in her quote, ""If this film prevents the bullying of even one child, then it's done its job"". I think this film can prevent the bullying of many children if we as adults make it point to show it.",1406505600,4,3402,4.622516556291391

8670355,2,B00M58FRWQ,"I thought this was going to be a ""movie"" about bullying. It's a 30min short film poorly acted and was hard to take seriously bc it was cheesy. Not for my high schooler! Perfect for elementary grade children. With that being said it makes a lot of good suggestions. Great for teachers to show in class on those rainy days with no recess. I'm going to donate this to the school if they don't have it already.",1471392000,,406,4.285714285714286

8670357,4,B00M58FRWQ,"I like the simple presentation, you understand the victim and the bully and are sad for them both. I checked this out from the library when I read it's description. I am an adult, middle age african american woman. I spoke out against the Iraq War (in two private conversations, one with my father, a now retired police officer who I later discovered reported Governor Jeb Bush's alleged affair to a Florida newspaper, an act which may have gotten his phones tapped by authorities investigating him, and upon hearing he and my political conversations (we're both liberal democrats) and our conversation disagreeing with America's involvement in the Iraq War (a political disagreement, nothing terrorist-related), my theory is that my father's enemies set up a taxi driver to initiate a conversation with me where I spoke again against the Iraq War (I didn't believe President Bush's allegations of weapons of mass destruction (there was no proof) and I suspected a resource grab. Since my conversations with my father, and the taxi driver (who I did not know and have never met again), I have been put onto some kind of ""watch"" or anti-terrorist list.

My life has been made a living hell. I am followed everywhere, even in my downstairs apartment, a person upstairs follows me room to room. Now you may think I'm exaggerating or that I've done something else to deserve having my life destroyed, but I promise you, I have not. Worse than even being harassed everywhere I go is my suspicion that my family has been entrapped/destroyed by the government and has been used to try to entrap me by advising me to do law-breaking behaviors, something they never did with me before they became entrapped. (Example: when I became ill and unable to work (and was convinced to apply for social security disability by a Legal Aid attorney) both of my parents offered me unsolicited advice, urging me to exaggerate my illnesses/symptoms (neither my father nor my mother had previous to this suggestion advised me to lie to anyone before, and I was over 50 years old when they made this suggestion to me so that means for 50 years before what I suspect is the government encouraging them to make these suggestions, for 50 years, they advised me to do the exact opposite, i.e., to live a truthful, ethical life. Their about-face was stunning to me but I still wouldn't have been able to understand they were being forced to do this except for the fact that I'd been harassed and targeted for years but wasn't sure who or why and for quite awhile thought I was imagining it, until I finally understood that no, my new life reality was that I was being targeted by someone or some entity.)

This entrapment has destroyed my family as I once knew it. I've written letters of complaint to the Justice Dept., State Dept., American Civil Liberties Union, all which netted me no relief or assistance (the American Civil Liberties Union wrote and told me with their limited budget they have to choose who they help and my case of individual political harassment did not meet their criteria).

There are so many tragic things about my experience, the hypocrisy of a government which advocates freedom of speech and encourages children to not bully, has become the ultimate bully and I fully and honestly expect them to be a player in my death. My medication dosage was once incorrectly called in to the pharmacy I use, I see what I consider to be evidence of their involvement with medical care providers, so many other behaviors that it would take me days to describe them all. Just yesterday at the grocery store a man approached while I waited in the checkout line with my back to him and he approached so quietly that I could not hear him, and suddenly and loudly began talking to me, clearly startling me, then excessively apologizing. I get all kinds of abuses, which are intended to look to the casual gaze as nonthreatening, non-premeditated but which so obviously are to me, with my unfortunate 15 years harassment experience. Last week after leaving my doctor's office I was accosted by at least 3 men, who suddenly veered into my path as I used my mobility device on the sidewalks to reach the bus stop or go to my apartment. My life is hell. Now as I type this comment, a person upstairs comes to stand directly above my bed as I lay here typing.

The worse thing for me, worse than having my life destroyed (I was once a legal secretary/legal word processor working multiple jobs, helping multiple family members, paying taxes, etc.) is that my family has been attacked. I don't know how it was done, probably various ways, but I strongly suspect that my family has been targeted and entrapped by the government (they must have broken some law), all with the intention of sicking them on me. Had I known and understood the government would go after my family, had I known that I was being targeted by my own government, I would've warned my family but for years I didn't know what was going on, only that something was wrong, but not what. You see, I'm no criminal and for quite awhile tried convincing myself that I was imagining things, as most of the people harassing me were not known to me.

So in my life experience, my democratic government has become the ultimate bully and I await either death by their hand (multiple light weight attempts have been made by cars stopping just short of me: a threat and a warning) or imprisonment on some trumped up charge. So I looked at this film because it dealt with a child being bullied, leading to his death, but I can honestly say that bullying happens to adults too, and by the very entity that is supposed to protect us: our government. I'm telling my story to warn others. I've tried to flee to Norway to apply for political asylum, but the documents I've sent multiple times have disappeared and the US Postal Service says they have no idea what happened to them, though they were sent with a signatory required designation. I don't know what to say to ordinary Americans, my co-citizens, except, be careful. Our government is apparently under so much pressure, there is so much corruption, that security agencies are able to use the post 9/11 laws Congress rushed through to pretty much do what they wish. To me, it appears as if they've lost their minds.

Perhaps it is partly having their fingers in so many pies world-wide, and gauging the political temperature of so many other troubled nations, who do not have the resources America has, has lead to our security agencies over-reacting (we see it in the militarization of our police) with citizens like me, who believed I could voice an opinion against a war I did not believe in, a war based on weapons of mass destruction which has been shown to have not existed, but apparently once you get on a watch list, you never get off, or at least that's my experience. Unfortunately all this is done under the radar as I've not yet been charged, and so because, I guess, they have no case as yet (though they do what they can to get a rise out of me: death by a thousand tiny cuts), they chose to harass me to death instead. (Currently on high blood pressure medication most recently at a doctor's office I'm seeing for sleep apnea, my two most recent blood pressure readings have been abnormally low. My blood pressure has never been this low so do I stop taking high blood pressure medication or do I believe the government is manipulating the blood pressure machines. Unfortunately I've had experience before when my medication dosage was called in incorrectly (which I suspect was deliberately done on order by anti-terrorist agents), and I didn't know it until I began experiencing side effects. They play these type of games. My comments complaining make it sound as if I'm totally insane and paranoid, but unfortunately, I'm not. Just an average person being targeted by her powerful government.

If you believe this is not 21st century America, you would be wrong.

I was a nerd in high school, hid from high school bullies in the library. I made it through college, the first person in my family to do so, I got work and helped my family. My family was poor when I was young (we've been working poor or poor for most of my life) so surprise, surprise, my political leanings are liberal. Disagreeing with a war does not make me a terrorist, but the post 9/11 laws and America's apparent huge security anti-terrorist agency network need to justify their existence and so a liberal disagreeing with a war can be attacked, but so sneakily most citizens wouldn't believe the tactics used, but you need to know.

So I tell what's being done to me, in the forums I can, like this comment section. You may not believe what I've written, but at least you've read about it. Much of what I've written I cannot prove. I am sick and poor, targeted, mostly isolated and alone. I do not pray for death but I do not fear it. What saddens me most I think is the idea that as the world's resources shrink, governments anticipating future political unrest, are positioning themselves now, and the tactics they use are so much worse, underhanded and sneaky than big guns, big tanks and drones: your family members, your loved ones, can be entrapped into illegal activity by the government and then pressured by that government into entrapping you, all without you or they knowing what's going on until it is too late. I'm assuming that after becoming entrapped, citizens become government slaves, coerced into taking a deal to aid the government, in an attempt to avoid jail/prison. My advice: break no law. If you do break a law, do your time in jail. Taking a deal can come back to bite you, as you may find that your life is not your own.

This story about a child killed while attempting to deal with a bully tells children what they should do, and what I'm trying to do: speak up, try to get help, at the very least don't remain silent.",1421798400,,9926,4.641069397042093
8670358,5,B00M58FRWQ,"An amazing film about bullying through the eyes of a child. But, this is much more than that! It offers solutions to this problem and I am impressed to see such a film that can really make a difference!",1416787200,,202,4.205128205128205
8670359,5,B00M58FRWQ,"Genuinely spectacular! This well done story tells the truth and tragedy of bullying. Directed, written and starring 10-year-old Gerry Orz who portrays Adam Syder, the new kid in the neighborhood. Adam is being bullied by Nathan (Zane Paul), a boy who has a mother (Willow Hale) that treats him like garbage. Day after day Adam is beaten up and called names by Nathan and soon Adam has had enough.

One of the many reasons this film shines is the message it stresses- speak up! Bullying is a problem in our society. Whether its physical, verbal or cyber-bullying, it needs to stop and the message is addressed in a passionate way by the filmmaker. Orz shows the reality of what happens to many children who suffer from bullying. He doesnt take the easy route where someone is picked on and the teacher comes in and fixes the problem. He tells us the truth.

Everyone's point of view is examined, which I love, including the bully Nathan. The bully is not the villain. He wants to be friends with Adam, but his mother says otherwise. Whenever someone picks on me, my mom always tells me, ""You don't know what happens behind closed doors. Shes right, I dont. The bully could be going through abuse himself or he might be jealous and bullying is the only way he knows how to express it.

My hats off to Zane Paul for his outstanding performance. We also have a heartbreaking story about Adams sister Miranda (Kaitlin Morgan). She knows Adam is being bullied, but she doesnt tell anyone. She thinks Adam will take care or it, which he does, in the wrong way.

By far, my favorite character is Adams mom (Kate Orz). Something tragic happens and we see this emotional scene between her and Miranda. Its hard to sit through because both Kates and Kaitlin's performances make this film even more powerful. It shows the struggle of not only the person being bullied, but the familys grief as well.

All these aspects of the film are amazing and what makes it truly phenomenal is that this film was made by Gerry Orz when he was ten years old! Gerry tells this story in a very mature manor that allows all ages to comprehend the dangers of bullying. His introduction to the film explains why he made it and what he wants you to learn from it. The introduction alone is worth the price of the film. Gerry doesnt want anyone else to go through the pain of being bullied and this proves the power of making a film on the subject.

This is a film for adults and kids, especially kids. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 8- to 18-year-olds. This film has one word in it that is not terrible, in fact its appropriate, but parents may not want their kids to hear it. Even with that I still highly recommend this film to kids so they can know to speak up and STOP the bullying. This film comes out on DVD October 14, 2014.
