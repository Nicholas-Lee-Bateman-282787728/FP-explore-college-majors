8406065,4,B003UN6R1K,"""Bondage Game"" is one of the weirdest (sickest) Japanese anime I've ever had the 'pleasure'(?) to behold.  The 'plot' is pretty non-existent - the action follows the 'adventures' of a young (orphan) woman who ends up in a mansion of evil where female 'servants' are the playthings of a sadistically deranged man who subjects them to the most bizarre torments imaginable!  Through this heroine's eyes the viewer watches as 'other' women are debased, and even killed! - until she herself eventually becomes  the focus of unspeakable sexual tortures. This anime presents VERY strong BIZARRE sexual imagery.and violence that could be offensive to those not prepared for its' content nor context within the specific genre that it represents.  Japanese art is rich in fantastic scenarios and this tendency towards the fantastic is carried into the realm of erotic art - providing some of the most intense and imaginative ero-weirdness to be found - anywhere!

Individuals who are aware of the range of extreme concepts that Japanese based 'hentai' imagery can involve are doubtless familiar with one of its' stranger obsessions: hyper-sexual hermaphroditic creatures that combine both male & female sexual organs.  Hard-core Japanese erotica also places a lot of attention on various excretory bodily functions (enemas/golden showers) and the humiliation that arises therefrom. ""Bondage Games"" presents graphic examples of these 'themes' in a parade of images that is truly 'jaw-dropping'!  In addition to a lot of heavy-duty bondage and coercive sex - there's also a lot of 'body-modification' scenarios that stretch the limits of credulity to the point that the visions presented become surreal, and perhaps less arousing as a result... itz just 'too weird'!  In the fetish art world there is an illustrator named ""Benson' who specializes in pictures of women taken to extremes of sexualization via almost sci-fi like medical procedures.  This anime is sorta in that same ball-park.

The usual cautionary admonition: ""not for the faint of heart"" seems almost too tame for this bent bit of animation.  The content will probably only appeal to the most seriously crazed & jaded of S/M oriented porn hounds.  If there's any 'redeeming value' in ""Bondage Games"" it might be: to allow 'perverse' individuals to realize that: no matter how strange one thinks that their own 'fantasies' are - the Japanese have got you beat by a mile!  Must be seen to be believed - but be forewarned that THIS one REALLY pushes the envelope!  The DVD is crystal clear - the animation style 'sparse' but effective - the story is broken into 2 Chapters (approx 30 min each) - there are several audio options, including: dubbed English & Jap. w/ Eng subs. - fully XXX adult only.  The only extras are some trailers for other 'hentai' anime weirdness.",1453507200,,2820,5.126637554585153
8406066,2,B003UN6R1K,"Wow.  Ever seen Japanese Horror movies? A really disgusting Japanese, Brazillian, or European porno video?  Did you ever wonder what would result if you mixed in the distinct characterization of anime?  Its not my habit to look at pornography but every once while, there is movie that stands out so boldly you cannot help but look on in a perverse curiosity like watching videos of people being seriously injured/killed or how animals are slaughtered for food - this is one of those movies.

Bondage Game is a two-part series where in the ingnue is kidnapped to fulfill the perverse and misogynistic fantasies of a doctor living secluded mansion filled with a harem of maids. Like most pornography or horror, there is not much plot per se, but rather opposite sex relation is used a foil have young women sexually suffer (and two scenes, die) as fan service to an audience with the most peculiar fetishes.  This one has a little of everything and some things that only the most demented and misogynistic minds can think of - in addition to strong bondage and discipline heterosexual action, its one of the few videos in hentai anime (I am pretty sure its only 1 of 4) to contains scenes involving  a particular bodily function. If that is not enough for you, it also features some things that you can only get away in animated form like surgical body modification.  If the reader has a problem trying to understand what comes with body modification, then this video is definitely not for you. This set is combination of sexually and horror made to elicit the same viewer response as any ""rape and revenge"" film - without much of the revenge.

If any of the above mentioned is new to you, I want you to know that not all anime is pornographic and features like these are usually the result of the distinct Japanese culture of attention and hospitality working hand in hand with the freedom of speech.  Personally, I wish that you would not buy this as it tends to perpetuate the stereotype of Japanese film industry but I have no doubt that concerns like that take a backseat to watching cute girls in maid uniforms in extreme bondage.",1423180800,,2860,5.869879518072289
8406067,2,B003UN6R1K,"This is without a doubt the most graphic adult animated series I have come across.

Most people who are buying this probably already know what they are getting into here. There was a point in time where I too thought I desired this kind of a thing, but in hindsight, I was wrong.

Sure, there are a few fetish scenes here that you just aren't going to find animated very often anywhere else. Honestly, in retrospect I would have just been better off finding clips online of the handful of scenes I wanted to see, rather than subjecting myself to the entire thing.

If you have seen this already and there are only a few key scenes of this that appeal to you, then I suggest you do similarly. There is just so much other brutality and grotesque graphic material to have to stomach that I do not care for at all, and some scenes that are downright disturbing, that it just isn't worth the few scant moments of appeal.

Honestly it's really going to boil down to your particular flavor of kink, but just know that degradation of women is present throughout the entire thing, they're treated worse than filth, and that's almost not even worth mentioning compared to the graphic nature of the rest of the package. Be prepared for shocking violence and extreme fetish content in animated form, and not even a decent plot or character that serves any real purpose.",1417219200,,1357,4.549180327868853
