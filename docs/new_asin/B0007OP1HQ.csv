2224487,5,B0007OP1HQ,"If your child loves dinosaurs, this is a nice change from the Land of Time collection.  It's fun and well-written and animated without any negative messages.  My only concern is I don't favor some of the name-calling between 2 of the ""villainous"" characters.",1168300800,,258,4.976744186046512
2224488,5,B0007OP1HQ,"She liked Nara the female protagonist and 26 the dinosaur. We were able to convert her from her fairytopia obsession with this movie, making her 5th birthday party dinotopia themed instead of Barbie. 5 stars in my book!",1151452800,,219,4.7894736842105265
2224489,4,B0007OP1HQ,"This movie is about Kex, an orphan, who stows away on a lifeboat, hoping to see the world. Instead, he finds himself washed ashore on Dinotopia, a mysterious island where humans and dinosaurs coexist. He becomes friends with a triceratops named 26, and before long they find themselves in trouble as evil Ogthar is released from his stone prison and recovers the Ruby Sunstone, whose dark power can endanger all of dinotopia.

My four year old is mad about dinosaurs and was given this video by his grandmother. Though he loves the movie now, he was very afraid of the evil Ogthar the first few times we watched it (we had to turn the movie off). It is a bit scary, so keep that in mind with young children. Also, note that this video is animated and not the same as the Dinotopia miniseries. From an adult's perspective, it's the same old dribble...but if it keeps the kids entertained for 75 minutes, can you really complain?",1137369600,,927,4.5843373493975905
2224490,3,B0007OP1HQ,"That's exactly what this seems to be. A talking, preteen 26? More sunstone problems? C'mon-it's Dinotopia, and brimming with possibilities. Why this?

And why animated?",1117843200,3,168,5.72

2224494,4,B0007OP1HQ,The DVD arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition.  The reason for the 4 star rating as nothing to do with the vendor.  The vendors service was superb.  This animated version of Dinotopia was a let down and was meant for young children.  I enjoyed the Mini-series and the TV Series very much.  Anyone thinking that this animated version is on a par with the live action versions will be in for a letdown.,1435017600,,418,4.376623376623376
2224495,1,B0007OP1HQ,"this movie is AWFUL its an insult to Dinotopia and its creator James Gurney. the animation is good for a home video release and the background paintings aren't that bad either. EVERYTHING ELSE is completely horrible

2224514,3,B0007OP1HQ,"My son is in love with this movie. I am not.

I am not well versed in the Dinotopia Universe, but having watched the miniseries and read through the original book by James Gurney, I found that this film follows similar plots to those two. There is Dinotopia, a strange lost island where humans and dinosaurs live side by side in harmony, where the dinosaurs are intelligent and can speak for themselves. Also there are the sunstones which power all of Dinotopia, but are now failing for some reason. In this particular quest, there is a villain named Agthar who plans on using the power of the Ruby Sunstone to create an army of villainous dinosaurs to conquer all of Dinotopia.

What I didn't like about the film is that the protagonist is a bratty kid with ubiquitous headphones and skateboard who shows up on the scene and already wants to take everything for granted. Also, there are the two antagonist dinos, which in reality are a bunch of greedy buffoons. The one dinosaur, a parasaurolophus voiced by Kathy Griffin, is constantly using language inappropriate for a small child, like ""you idiot!"", and ""What's that stupid kid think he's doing"" and then is either constantly committing violence or talking about it, such as ""remind me to hurt you later.""

The main dinosaur character, a chasmosaurus named twenty six, is also a poor role model. She's vain, she's flighty, she's irresponsible.

The only slightly likable character in the whole movie is Mara, voiced by Tara Strong. She has a more developed sense of morality, but often comes across as too bossy.

I purchased this movie because my son loves dinosaurs, but after I watched it the first time, I was appalled at the poor scriptwriting, weak plot, and unlikely action. My son however feels differently. He has watched it at least seven times now, and when he's not watching it, he wants to act it out with his dino action figures. I guess what matters is that he enjoys it.",1364342400,3,1941,4.713864306784661
2224515,5,B0007OP1HQ,Bought this for my little dinosaur lover and he watched it over and over. Great movie for 7 and under.,1362960000,,102,4.15

2224518,5,B0007OP1HQ,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So Im short about 19 0r so words for your review.,1353888000,,89,3.5
2224519,4,B0007OP1HQ,I bought this for my granddaughters and they loved it.  They like just about anything with dinosaurs in it.  The reason for the four stars is because I believe they could have done so much more with this story and made it a bit longer.  With children they seem to like more action and there is action with this but it would have been nice to see more character emphasis.  I know I am writing this as an adult though so since the granddaughters liked it then it must have met their expectations.,1348876800,,494,4.279569892473118

2224522,4,B0007OP1HQ,My son had to have this movie after seeing the trailer on another video. It was worth getting since the characters are fun and it has an easy story to follow. He enjoys watching this one over and over.,1310256000,,201,4.17948717948718
2224523,2,B0007OP1HQ,"Let's start out with the fact that, yes, it's a kids' movie and it's a good fit for kids. It has fun dinosaurs and what kid doesn't like fun dinosaurs? If you're babysitting, you can sit down with your kid and enjoy this harmless, silly romp about dinosaurs, friendship and adventure that children adore and dream about. I saw this myself when I sat down with my eight-year-old cousin to watch it, and she insisted it was a great and memorable movie, on par with or even better than Pan's Labyrinth, which she had seen me watching a little before. So I watched this movie with my little film critic cousin and watched her totally adore it, beginning to end.

This doesn't mean I have to pretend it's a good movie, though. It's full of idiocy, inaccuracy, and ridiculous over-simplification of the gorgeous and well-thought-out book series that it originated from.

There is literally nothing else defining about Dinotopia but its dinosaurs. Everything else about their culture, buildings and society are VERY human; there are no inventions, language or behaviors just for dinosaurs as there obviously should be, they being isolated...FOREVER as they have. The movie had some big-name voice actors whose talent was wasted on plain or stupid dialogue, especially Kathy Griffin. The main character Kex (what kind of a name is that? Sounds like a cereal!) loses his surprise/wonderment at the Dinotopia world at the snap of a finger. 26 sometimes talks in slang that Dinotopia can't possibly have heard of before. One little dinosaur, Spaz, is...really irritatingly stupid. He tells awful jokes, once sucked snot out of 26's nose (thinking he was gonna get milk?) and, seconds after being born, he was walkin' and talkin' like he's several years old already. And of course, no character from the original series is anywhere to be seen.

""Hey, it's a kids' movie, lighten up.""

Yeah, yeah, that's the answer to everything, isn't it? -_-",1308528000,7,1931,4.932307692307693

2224525,4,B0007OP1HQ,"My three year old grandson loved the movie. He was not the least bit scared. Whereas my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter does not care for it at all.

Animated adventure, an orphan runs away, he's lost at sea and washes up on a hidden island, protected from the rest of the world by sun stones.  On the island people and dinosuars co-exist.  The villian is another outsider who tried to take over the island after finding a ruby sunstone, he was defeated and locked away for a hundred years only to be awoken by two bumbling dinosuars. This adventure the orphan and two new found friends defeat the bad guy once again.

My child was dissapointed but otherwise, pleased to own the movie.  Cute dinosaur movie.  It still had its ""scary"" scenes with the ""bad guy"", but not as scary as other movies made out there, geared toward the same age level.  Loved hearing Carol Burnett's voice as one of the dino characters.  Loved her in Horton Hears a Who, too.  Bad girl in both cartoon movies!",1251072000,,482,4.6

2224530,3,B0007OP1HQ,"Truthfully, I would give this 2 stars, maybe 1, but my daughter loves this film, so I had to compromise on a 3.  It's not my favorite, the storyline is a bit silly, but she loves dinosaurs and can't resist watching this one at least once a week.  The whole dinotopia story (the version for adults) always seemed so preposterous to me, so this one is also a hard one for me to swallow, but I guess as a kid I had my favorite ridiculous movies that my parents didn't understand either.
