4104273,4,B003AND1TG,"""The Agatha Christie Hour, Set 1"" another classic British mystery television series, and a long-awaited one, finally arrives here.  Ten episodes of it were made by Thames Television for Britain's ITV (independent television stations), in 1982; it was broadcast on Public Broadcasting's ""Mystery!"" in the early 1980s.  We now get the first five stories, showing another, softer side of, possibly, the world's most famous and beloved practitioner of British mystery writing.  They arrive in a boxed set of two disks, running approximately 257 minutes, with, happily, subtitles, and an interesting feature on Christie's early non-Poirot work.

The series was based on short fiction by Dame Agatha, the mistress of mystery; all the episodes are set in the 1920s and `30's, and do not feature her signature detective Hercule Poirot.  However, interestingly enough, they feature some characters that carry over to the Poirot stories, most notably Miss Lemon, Poirot's secretary/assistant, and Ariadne Oliver, a fictional, successful detective novelist who much resembles her creator.  The production is blessed with the meticulous attention to detail that used to characterize British TV: costumes, transportation, interiors are accurate, and the location photography is excellent.  The stars are worthy of their settings: they include a young John Nettles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-15/dp/B002MUAXIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 15</a>); the respected Maurice Denham (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Passion-Spent/dp/B000F4RHC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Passion Spent</a>); a handsome young Rupert Frazer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P-D-James-Cover-Her-Face/dp/B00007KK1X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P.D.

The supporting players are also strong, and there was no skimping on extras.  The stories run from crime-solving, to romance and the supernatural.

The episodes are:
""The Case of the Middle-Aged Wife.""  A cheated-upon housewife hires Parker Pyne, retired civil servant and `doctor of happiness.'  Pyne sends forth Claude, a handsome young almost gigolo played by Rupert Frazer.  Can Claude help this neglected wife to recapture her husband's attention?
""In a Glass Darkly.""  There's an engagement party; a handsome young guest has a vision of the bride-to-be, the sister of his friend, at risk, and suggests she break her engagement, which she does.  The young man struggles through World War I, and comes back to marry the young woman himself.  A strong episode and an early look at post-traumatic stress disorder, which they then called shell shock.
""The Girl in the Train.""  A suddenly unemployed young broker decides to take a train trip from London to Portsmouth, U.K.  He meets a beautiful young woman on the train, and finds himself mixed up with spies and international affairs.  A light and fluffy comic romance.
""The Fourth Man.""  Another train trip.  A young John Nettles has the difficult acting job of playing a Frenchman, just sitting and telling a story (that verges on the supernatural) to his three train compartment companions, a doctor, a churchman, and an academic.  Luckily, they're all played by solid supporting actors, including Michael Gough, and there are atmospheric flashbacks to France, in which a young Fiona Mathieson does good work.
""The Case of the Discontented Soldier."" A bored retired Army man goes to Parker Pyne for stimulation.  An entertaining little mystery that features an appearance by the fictional Ariadne Oliver.

The short story genesis of these entertainments precludes much of Christie's customary complexity of plot; but the fact that these stories were written in the eras in which they were set does give them a certain resonance, and Thames TV sure knew how to make mysteries.  Worth a look any time.",1277856000,33,4159,6.178819444444445
4104274,5,B003AND1TG,"I have been waiting for years for these programs to come to dvd! My family and I watched them on A&E many years ago when it was still a good network. The scripts are excellent, the acting superb. Rather atypical fare for Christie dramatizations, but still quite worthy. I am giving the programs 5 stars for content.

The complaint that I have is with the marketing here in America. There were actually 10 dramatizations done for The Agatha Christie Hour. This set contains only five for, at this writing, $28.99. The British set contains all 10 stories and is labeled as ""the complete set"". It was released only about a month ago with the same cover art (a five disc set, two stories per disc), so it's not as if our American set is a re-release or a re-think. So, again as of this writing, the British set containing all 10 stories is available from Amazon.co.uk (in case the site name is deleted, it's this site's sister site in England) ~ at a price of $31.35 after conversion to dollars from pounds and adding shipping and handling.

Our American release is saying ""Set 1"". Let me tell you that Acorn, the distributor, is notorious for bringing out the first part of a series and never bringing out the rest. So, assuming that they do eventually bring out ""Set 2"", if it is priced like set one the total price for all 10 will be $57.98. That's a far cry from the $31.35 that the Brits are paying for their region 2 release.

This pricing practice seems to be the norm (I daresay that the Brits also pay a premium for our shows). If you love British fare, as I do, you are paying a high premium when you buy their discs in region 1 format ~ and unfortunately many of their tv shows and movies are never released in region 1. When the tv shows are released here in America they are often done piecemeal like this Agatha Christie Hour release. Quite often, only the first year or so is ever released.

If you feel as I do that this practice is unfair, do yourself a favor and purchase a region free dvd player. There are many available here at Amazon, some for under $60~ or just google and find one. It will pay for itself with just a few purchases of region 2 discs. I have not only saved a lot of money by purchasing region 2, but I am also able to buy dvds of shows that are not available here in America and I am often able to enjoy British shows at least a year before they are released here in the USA.",1276992000,316,2410,4.2785087719298245
4104275,4,B003AND1TG,"Agatha Christie has done more for British Mystery than any other writer, and this set provides some of her lesser known tales. It's not Poirot, but some of the Poirot characters first appeared in these stories. Five different mysteries, but all taking place in the 1920-30s period, and provide a look at a bit more of Christie than perhaps Poirot displays. There is more to Agatha Christie than just mystery.

The true question for this series is not Will Christie's stories be good?; but Will the acting be up to script level? Are the actor's worthy? They are. The series is cast with several British members of high achievement and fame. The 5 episodes give us interesting mixes from romance to crime. They come alive, enchanting at times, suspenseful at other times.

Episode details:
""Case of the Middle-Aged Wife"": London's Parker Pyne (Maurice Denham), 'Dr. of Happiness' is engaged by a cheated-upon wife. Does it help, Mr. Pyne, to reverse the cheating participants? What's good for the George is good for the Maria. Claude is played by Rupert Frazer(The House of Eliott)

""In a Glass Darkly"": A murder 'vision' is seen by a party guest causing him to suggest to the fiance that she not go through with her wedding. After serving in WWI, he returns & the prophecy takes on new meaning.

""Girl in the Train"": International intrigue involving a broker, a blonde, and an encounter on the train to Portsmouth--England not Massachusetts. Mystery, comedy, romance, and adventure; Agatha Christie style.

""Fourth Man"": Riding the train together from London to Scotland was a doctor, a lawyer, and a clergyman. Sounds like a joke--but not when the 4th man joins the train compartment. John Nettles (Midsomer Murders), very young, is the 4th man. Fiona Mathieson also gives a great performance.

""Case of the Discontented Soldier"": Parker Pyne gets another client in this series. An ex-soldier misses the excitement and danger of the military. His life in an English village is a bit droll--but oh so beautiful. Great place to visit. Wm. Gaunt plays the Major.

This set does have subtitles for those needing them. It also has an Agatha Christie bio in text and Parker Pyne: Before Poirot, also text.",1276905600,46,2199,4.927027027027027

My mother has been telling me for years about a show featuring Parker Pyne, one of Christie's characters, and I'd never been able to find it. When I saw it on Amazon I immediately purchased it on this set and hoped I had the right one. She loves it! It was a perfect gift, and she's already watched it several times, and no doubt will watch it many more times.

Amazon gave both of us a gift by offering this: my mother is enjoying the shows and I'm enjoying all the pleasure she's getting out of seeing them again.",1370217600,,613,4.108333333333333
4104288,3,B003AND1TG,"Although the show was done extremely well, it needed a little more excitement for us.  Perfect though for those who like mysteries and want to watch with their families.",1363305600,2,169,4.827586206896552
4104289,3,B003AND1TG,"Thirty years ago, ""The Agatha Christie Hour"" featured fifty-minute, video-taped adaptations of the far more obscure Christie short stories (some mysteries, some not).  In this particular collection of tales (which are performed like live stage plays), Volume 1 features the melancholic, war-flavored ""In a Glass Darkly"" melodrama starring Nicholas Clay; the similarly depressing ""The Fourth Man,"" as told in flashback aboard a train between three friends and a stranger; the light comedy ""The Girl in the Train;"" and perhaps the two best (and well-known) Parker Pyne tales, ""The Case of the Middle-Aged Wife"" and ""The Case of the Discontented Soldier.""

While one should keep in mind that these television adaptations clearly embellish Christie's stories (for either needed depth or just simply padding).  Of the five, ""Girl on the Train"" and the two Parker Pyne stories are worthy of multiple viewings, but the other two not so much.  ""Girl on the Train"" works best, as haplessly unemployed (and self-absorbed) broker George Rowland (Osmund Bullock) practically begs a mysterious woman (Sarah Berger) for a spy adventure after he helps her elude a menacing foreigner aboard a train.  It certainly makes one wish to re-read this amusing story again, as the dialogue is even funnier on the page.  As for Parker Pyne, frankly, I had for years visualized actor John Astin (of ""The Addams Family"") as Pyne rather than the elderly British actor, Maurice Denham, as seen here.  Astin's entertaining acting style has just the right twinkle-in-the-eye amusement that a character like Parker Pyne needs.  Despite Denham's stuffy, dry interpretation of Pyne, the stories are still relatively entertaining but they are missing the underlying humorous, tongue-in-cheek flavor the written stories convey (much like the literary ""Girl on the Train."").  The last two stories, we found, simply were not entertaining, particularly ""The Fourth Man,"" despite its intriguing premise.

Overall Rating: 7/10 (We would suggest a rental first, if possible, before making a decision as a consumer).

P.S.  As as a fan-friendly note, look for Ms. Lemon (as Pyne's secretary) and Ariadne Olivier (novelist-for-hire) make brief appearances in the ""Parker Pyne"" segments.  Yes, they were originally introduced by Christie in Pyne's short stories before they were transferred over to Hercule Poirot's ongoing detective novels.",1360886400,,2396,5.46070460704607

4104298,4,B003AND1TG,"Back in the early  80's , the brits were still mainly using videotape on many shows (of course some were in film too), they were at least saving these shows by then, many of the earlier taped shows had been wiped or erased to make more space in the archives etc. This one survived in pretty good shape with some damage that is very slight. unlike lets say 'flickers' from 1980 which has alot of damage so it's very watchable and retains it's videotape feel. I disagree that the acting is bad in this one as one reviewer stated , I think these tv veterans did a fine job, the sets look very good a well done as well. The war footage in episode two is quite good for it's day , with rotting skeletons lying around the battlefield even. which is very accurate of the ww1 trench warfare.  The stories are romance tales mainly with a few suspense mystery tales, Christie being a talented writer was creating other work than her main mystery work and she came up with some good stories. These stories invented some great ideas that we now have seen in many films and books, like a mirror premonition in ep two. It was NEW back THEN. Some people can't handle the videotape ethos of these stories , I prefer film too , and shows like the prisoner had laid down great filmwork in the uk so it was doable, often slag these shows and say they are bad they are wrong this isn't bad at all, but it's not christies sharp mystery work here, she had the right to create a different vien of story , like one featuring a lonely middleclass woman etc. The last few eps are more mystery orientated though. However acorn video has done it again and cut this series into two parts which is lame. One reviewer discovered that the region 2 version has all ten eps in it.  But you must have a all region dvd player to view that one. If you don't you can get the rest of this 1981 series in set 2 which will be out on dvd soon.  This one is definately filled with more christie the woman writing for woman type of stories but that was ok by me, she was great at any type of writing she did. And to think of it , if steven king wants to write a romance story who says he can't?",1292025600,,2150,4.1734939759036145

For those used to the live and on-the-spot ambiance of modern TV and cinema, these dramatizations may seem ""quaint"" or ""odd.""  They have a feeling of live stage rather than on camera presentation.  If you're into day time soaps, you'll recognize the character.  With both of these the audience is expected to suspend disbelief and take part in the events mentally.  While they know there is nothing but a stage beyond the scenery, it would be considered unsportsmanlike to acknowledge it, so to speak.

4104315,4,B003AND1TG,"Delving more into romance than mystery here, Agatha Christie brings us some stories we don't expect from the master of mystery.  I only read her mystery books, so this departure was a little unexpected by me.  I know she wrote romance stories under another pseudonym, so I was expecting mystery short stories.

The production quality of these programs is not up to what we expect from the Miss Marple & Poirot TV series.  They are produced on video-tape & often look like soap-operas.  I have come to enjoy the filmed quality of the later book adaptations, so this took a little away from my enjoyment of the show.  There are some video glitches & color banding in the shows, the video tape masters are almost 30 years old so these defects can be expected.  You will think of the Rumpole Of The Bailey TV series when you see these shows.

THE CASE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED WIFE - Parker Pyne adds spice to the life of a neglected wife.  This episode has the lowest production values, a stagy presentation with no mood music. It is hard to believe this ran in PBS's Mystery show as there is no mystery.  It is a ""Fantasy Island"" type of romance story.
Originally published on the short story collection PARKER PYNE INVESTIGATES.

IN A GLASS DARKLY plays out like an old ""One Step Beyond"" program.  Agatha Christie delves into the supernatural world of premonitions. This hour long story suffers from the same problem that the hour-long ""Twilight Zone"" episodes suffer from, stretching a half-hour story out to one hour.  This would have been an excellent half-hour story, but it drags at one hour.  Things start off with a bang as we encounter the ghostly premonition, but little happens before the pay-off at the end.  Agatha Christie does explore the mental effects that war has on the returning soldiers, showing their mental breakdown.  When the original story was written I believe this was a new concept.
This supernatural story was first published in 1934 in Collier's magazine in the USA and Woman's Journal in the UK. Then is was published in the short story collection THE REGETTA MYSTERIES (US) and decades later in MISS MARPLE'S FINAL CASES (UK) even though it is not a Miss Marple Mystery.

THE GIRL IN THE TRAIN is very entertaining! Probably the best story in this set!  Mystery & Intrigue are intertwined with romance as a young woman sends a young man who is looking for excitement on the trail of a mystery man.  The pace of the story stays ahead of me, keeping me wondering what is going to happen next. The production values of this episode are much improved over the first and it almost feels like I am watching a filmed show.  The staginess is gone as we are taken on a train ride to various locations.  The Inn where the action takes us to is a wonderfully contorted 3-D set, adding to the twisted feel of the story.
This short story was first published in 1924 in Grand Magazine, then published in the short story collections THE LISTERDALE MYSTERY (UK) and THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (US).

THE FOURTH MAN - This is the story of two dead girls, one strong but average looking with little talent, the other dainty & weak with a pretty face & voice to go with it.  The pretty girl is nasty, wanting everything she can have including controlling and possessing those around her. Along comes a young man whom the average girl likes, but he only notices the pretty one who just wants to use him.  The story is told by this young boy some 20 years later on a train to three other men, he is the fourth man.  These four men, the story teller, a clergyman, a lawyer & a psychiatrist try to unravel the mystery behind the girl's deaths.  Easily the second best story in this set. My only complaint is that the characters are rather cardboard & almost unbelievable, but then we are seeing the story through the eyes of the story teller.  So the over exaggerated personalities may be the work of the story teller's imaginative mind.
This story was first published in 1925 in Pearson's Magazine. Then is was published in the short story collections THE HOUND OF DEATH (UK) and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (US).

THE CASE OF THE DISCONTENTED SOLDIER - Parker Pyne adds spice to the dull life of a soldier after he returns home.  I believe this is the only other Parker Pyne story adapted in this series. Ironically, these stories written in the 1930's feel like 1950's dramas, like the old THE MILLIONAIRE television series.
Another story from the PARKER PYNE INVESTIGATES short story collection.

Don't get too excited about the bonus material, I was expecting short documentaries but what I got was several pages of text.  The ""Christie Biography"" is only to inform those who don't know about her.  And the ""Parker Pyne: Before Poirot"" is a bit of a misnomer as the Poirot books came first.  The only information I found useful was the confirmation that the Miss Lemon working for Parker Pyne is the same Miss Lemon who went on to work for Poirot.

Overall, I am pleased to get more Agatha Christie story adaptations on DVD, but I do not find these romance stories as enjoyable as her mysteries.",1279584000,7,5109,4.615044247787611
